00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
We The Hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight September 17th 2006

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Oh My God We, Oh My God Free Xbox Live For Europe

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Oh My God We Have A Major Update Regarding Phantasy Star Universe and Oh My God Episode 200

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Attention!

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Mani Talk and then some.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted and mildly retarded content.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, it makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Samburgers, the cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
That was huge. Cool.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Have you seen Mountain Dew?

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Lena, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
So it was you. I was going to expose you.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I know. So I choose to expose myself.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Please, there are ladies present.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Dark Sakura.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh my God, I see a bloody stump!

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Sky. Anytime in the place, baby.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Loki. Ow, my foot! Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
We are live, and this is episode number 200 for this September the 17th of 2006.

02:47.000 --> 02:57.000
You're listening to the Bemani Scene's most ancient podcast and radio station of all things Bemani.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
But as of about a year ago, all things video games, tonight is a very special show, boys and girls.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Yes, that intro was specially made just for tonight. Hope you enjoyed it.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh my God, there's fire in here right now.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Chris has surprised us with her presence, and she's brought us a cake with a big 200 on it.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Wait, hold on, hold on. I have to take a picture on my cell phone so we have something for the site.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Rob, have I told you lately that I love you for that intro?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I just want to...

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I forgot about the bloody stump.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I just want to warn people, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge...

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh my God, you almost dropped that fucking cake.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
I just want to warn you guys, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, tonight is going to be a really fucked up episode.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
We are celebrating our 200th episode. We have a lot of surprises in store, and I guess this is one of them.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I had no idea we had a cake coming.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay, Loki, Dark Soccer, we have to all blow out the candles together.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Look out, they're going to blow.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Look out, we're going to blow.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Oh, this is so cute. I took a picture, we'll put it up on the website later.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
What are we wishing for?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
One, two, three.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yay!

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
We blew them all out, it comes true.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
All right.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Thank you guys so much, this is awesome.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Wow.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only...

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I was trying to reinvoke the old intro there, but that threw me off.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
So much for that.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
It's cake pie.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Cake pie!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Say hello to the...

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Another surprise, I got another surprise.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh my God, I got a...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
What?

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
This is just craziness, I just got a T.R. that says over the hill and Loki has one too.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
That's great.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
And Jamie has one too.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh my God, you guys are too much.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh, you guys, thank you.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Okay.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Happy happy birthday from the internet to you.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
We wish it was our birthday so we could party too.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Hey, happy happy birthday, all your gamer dreams come true.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Happy happy birthday from all of us to you.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Happy happy birthday.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh my God.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do tonight's show.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Alright, say hello to the one and only...

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Happiest bunny on the farm is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Who found the ferret?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I found the ferret!

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Woo!

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Woo, ferret!

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Oh my God.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Say hello to Tech Masa Loki.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
There's a lot of people in here that need less caffeine and sugar.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
That's alright.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
And say hello to Drew Nami who's here with us as he has been a lot lately.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Who needs to learn to put the microphone next to his mouth?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Definitely one person needs more caffeine, damn.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Alright.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Alright, say hello as well to Chris who's brought us all these wonderful surprises.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Thank you, Chris.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, that's okay, I thought of it up as Jamie and I were eating lunch and I said,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
You know what? I should bring donuts. You know what? Fuck that.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
It's their special birthday. We need something better.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
So we thought we'd get the carbiest, most sugariest thing we could find,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
which has a very rainbow-y happy birthday to it.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
This is so awesome.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Our cake is so gay.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
The surprises are just beginning, you guys, tonight.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
We have a lot of crap in store tonight.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Even the chat room doesn't know about some of the stuff we got planned.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It's going to be a very interesting show.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
We have cake pie.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
We're going to get to cake.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
But first, and we do have DDR Sneak Peaks continuing tonight,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
a very special edition of the DDR Sneak Peaks.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And it was confirmed, the ferret is gay.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
We have our gay ferret.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Alright, let's try to get some gaming news out of our system

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
because we have a lot, a lot, a lot of it this week.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
So first off, we start off every show.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
My gaming week was actually still more pinball.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
We got another pinball machine.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Another one.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
We have a Guns N' Roses pinball.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
My God, you guys are nuts.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
We're working on it right now.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
And I played some more Mario.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, that's it.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Alright.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Oh, I watched some porn too.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Congratulations.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
And I got some Yowie now.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I thought you said, how was your gaming week?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I don't know if that would be considered gaming.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
I consider it fun.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
You could play the Yowie drinking game.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I streamed HD porn to my 360, so does that count?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I was, I was there when you did that.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Tell everyone, do I get to lick the frosting off the candle?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yes.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Well, actually, I had another one too that we downloaded

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
that we streamed off my wonderful laptop here

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
because it has Media Center Edition on it.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
But, no, yeah, you can stream stuff with Media Accenter,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Media Center Accenter.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
And, unfortunately, well, actually, fortunately,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
the only thing that we had to test it with is porno.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
So we streamed, you know, 720p porno.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And the only thing we had to test with was porno.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
So, yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So we did that and it is very crisp.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Very, very crisp.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
The only thing I'm disappointed with...

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I actually saw it too and I will never see a clearer muff

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
in my entire life.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
The only thing that's bad about it though,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
and I don't know if, I couldn't stream it with like Dolby

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
or anything like that.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
That would be really cool if I could do that.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But, you know, whatever, it's cool.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
So we did that.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
So actual gaming stuff, I actually played some stuff

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
including, and I don't know why,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I got it for free from work, Bomberman Act Zero,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
and it started off pretty fun,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
but the whole thing, it's really sad

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
that the game fails by things that I would think

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
that would be really easy for the devs to either fix

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
or, I don't know, figure out that they were wrong

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
in the first place.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
The first thing, of course, being the fact

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
that you can't save at all.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
So if you were to beat the game,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
you had to play through 99 levels straight.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
By the way, only one kill, or one hit and you're dead

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
and you have to go all the way back to one,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
so that kind of sucks.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
There's no live system or anything like that.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
That's really kind of the only thing

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
that detracts you from the whole game.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
That and the fact that the camera angles

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
and everything like that.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
So, I don't know, it gets annoying,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
but it's still Bomberman.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
It's pretty fun, but, you know,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I wouldn't have paid money for it,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
so thank God I didn't have to.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Then I played a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I accidentally downloaded Time Pilot

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
because I meant to download Scramble,

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
so I ended up downloading them both,

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
and to be honest, Scramble's kind of lame

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
and so is Time Pilot.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Konami, you need to really make some better games

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
to put them out on live.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Also, maybe make your games, I don't know, widescreen.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I mean, seriously, if they remade it

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
for the graphics and stuff,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
why didn't they just add widescreen support to it?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I don't know, that wouldn't be that difficult.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You get pretty borders on the left

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
and right side of the screen.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Same borders are in every Konami arcade game.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Anyways, so I played those.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I played a little bit more Geometry Wars.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I played multiplayer on Marvel Blast,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
which was kind of lame.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I played multiplayer on Marvel Blast

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
because every time you start a multiplayer game,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
you're in the middle of someone else's game,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
so there's no possible way for you to win

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
because they're like 75 points ahead of you.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Well, wait until the game's over

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
and then they start a new game.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
That's fine, but that doesn't always happen.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
That's kind of lame, but whatever.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
What else did I play?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
More Grand Theft Auto, of course.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Actually, I emailed Rockstar

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
about Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
because we do play it so much

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
and we were bragging, or I was bragging to them

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
that I probably played it more than the devs did,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
and I think I probably did

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
since it doesn't seem like they played it much.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
And then, yeah, so hopefully I'll hear back from them

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
because I want to know how their multiplayer's

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
coming for that game because they better not fuck it up

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
or I will fly down there and beat them to death.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Anything else?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh, I played Mario Kart on the DS

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
while I was waiting for my dad for a movie today.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Fun? I played bow mode, and I don't like the bow movement.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
All right, I'm going to our chat room,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
which of course is always one of our other guests,

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
www.orangesonshady.com.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh, I'm sorry, and I played Chrome Helms in multiplayer.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
And got your ass kicked from what I hear.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Well, that's because my mic sucks.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm looking at our chat room.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
In fact, so many people in chat tonight,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
the names are scrolling off the screen.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
We can't see.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Anyway, I want to point out,

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Robert M. in chat says,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
when did you see Jairus on live?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
It's coming. We know it's coming.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
It's been previously announced.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
When? Couldn't tell you,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
but that's one I'm looking forward to as well.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I love Jairus. Awesome game.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
My gaming week.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I actually played a lot of different games.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I'll stick to the new stuff, though.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I played Scramble, even though I said on the show

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I wasn't going to. I couldn't help it.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I downloaded it. I like the new art style,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
which I thought is kind of interesting.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
But the game itself is kind of anti-climatic.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
The stages are so short, and each one of the stages

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
has some type of little niche to it.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Like, oh, stage three is where they're going to throw fireballs at you.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Oh, stage four is where you have to take...

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I don't like stage two. It's stupid.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't know what the fuck it is.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
The little asteroid things are pissing me off.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
But, okay, the game's from 81.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
What can you expect?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I mean, it's obviously an old, old game,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
but I would have just rather that effort

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
that they took porting Scramble be spent on like Gradius,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
which is a far superior shooter.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
It will not let me shoot as fast as I want to.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
You know the trick? This is what I do.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I put the controller down, and I tap the buttons

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
like my fingers are running between bullet bomb,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
bullet bomb, bullet bomb, and I do that really fast,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
and that's how I get all the way through stage four, at least.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Because stage five, the trick is you have to maneuver around

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
really quickly, and it's kind of hard.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Since that ship is like a boat.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
So, anyway, we have done Scramble, and it's okay.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I mean, if you like the classics,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
the upgrade was actually one of the nicer upgrades.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
The graphics do look really well,

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
and the sound's been done a lot better.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
But the game itself, I just can't recommend it

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
when it's put next to five dollar games

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
such as, you know, Geometry Wars,

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
and hell, even something like Frogger or Time Pilot

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
was a better buy than Scramble.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I'm sorry to say I wish they would put effort

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
into better games, but that's just me.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
The other game I played was surprisingly pleasant.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I played Test Drive Unlimited,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
which I actually enjoyed quite a bit.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
The gameplay is a lot like it reminded me

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
of Need for Speed Underground,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
and so you're probably thinking to yourself,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
okay, why do I need yet another racer on the Xbox 360?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
What makes this so special?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Well, Test Drive Unlimited is massive.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You are literally driving around the entire island of Oahu,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
and it's not, you know, 100% geographically correct,

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
but for folks who've never been there like me,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
it's got that illusion of that it does seem to be pretty,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
you know, right on to what it's probably

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
really like in that environment.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
And you drive around and you do different races,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
like you stop at different intersections and do races,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
or you pick up hookers and take them to the shopping place

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
they need to go, or you drive cars, hitchhikers,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
lots of different types of quests and things you can do.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
It's a questing driving game.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
But the other weird thing about it

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
that's getting this game a lot of notoriety

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
is that even when you're playing in single-player mode,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
if you're playing on Xbox Live,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
some of the dummy cars that you usually see driving in traffic

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
are actually other players.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
And you'll see their Xbox Live name,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
they are playing single mode as well.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So it's kind of like an MMO, but not really.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
It's the weirdest concept.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
That is exactly why I can't get that game,

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
because I'd be such a jackass.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I'd be like, attack!

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I'll tell you what though, I love the idea,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
and I think it's great that they're doing this

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
to make the game different than other racing games,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
but I don't know.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
I find when I'm racing around,

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I don't really run into other people

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
right next to them very often.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I've driven by maybe three people.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Supposedly you're supposed to crash into them

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
and start a race, but sometimes they drive by so fast

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
you don't even realize that somebody went by.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I guess that's what you have to do.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It's interesting. It's an interesting concept.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
I'll have to play the game a little more

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
to see how it's fully enabled.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I just joined the oil army clan.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Thanks to Rob Way, he created the oil army clan on the game,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
so I just joined that.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Look for that if you're on Test Drive,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
and hopefully you'll be able to experience more

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
of what multiplayer has to offer.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Speaking of the oil army,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm going to be releasing the general design

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
for the t-shirts for anybody who wants to make one

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
until we can get the ability to put them up.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
We should register our numbers though.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
How are our numbers?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Awesome. The other quick thing I wanted to say

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
about Test Drive Unlimited is I was kind of bummed out

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
that some of the multiplayer races, at least none of the ones I drove by,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
were restricted by car class,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
because I got the game about a week after it came out

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
and by the time I'm ready to do multiplayer races

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
everybody in there has a souped-up, maximum, top-of-the-line car,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
so I would have liked to have seen some multiplayer races

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
that were restricted a little more by the class car

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
so you could have beginner multiplayer races, intermediate,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
and not everybody's just kicking my ass

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
because they have a top-of-the-line car

15:49.000 --> 15:49.000
because they've been playing longer.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
That was my thought.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
if you're a fan of driving games,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
and I think even if you're not a fan of driving games,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
rent it, check it out, because you might...

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I mean, it's a good deal, 40 bucks.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
It's cheaper than the usual Xbox 360 game,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
so it's hard for me to ignore that as well,

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
being a big factor in why I would recommend this game

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
for you to pick up.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Plus, it's fun driving a Lamborghini off-road.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
It is, but the cops get annoying.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
They get really annoying.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I wish there was a way you could turn them off.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
No, it's funny, but the cops, they can't follow you off-road.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Oh, really? I didn't realize that.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
No, they're stupid. They can't figure out how to get off the road,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
so I have to just drive through an unpaved section.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
There's like, duh, where'd he go?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Or just sit in the grass, and they're like,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
oh, I don't know how to get to him.

16:31.000 --> 16:31.000
JeremyTau1 in chat says,

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
a friend I know that lives in Hawaii says

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
the map is really close to the area, but it isn't perfect.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
He says he can see where he is in the game

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
because he knows the roads in person,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
so yeah, it's pretty close to the actual thing.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
It's kind of interesting.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.000
All right.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Drunami, how was your gaming week?

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
Well, not too eventful. I've been leveling a warrior in World of Warcraft.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
It's pretty good. I can see where a lot of people say they're Imba,

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
but I haven't really got past 18, so that remains to be seen.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I've also been trying to finish Xenosaga episode one,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
or rather, watching it.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
I admit, I like it even though it's very, very long on cutscenes,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
and the battle system is sort of frustrating,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
but it's a good game, a very deep story.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Other than that, I haven't really been doing much in the way of gaming.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
All right.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Chris, anything you want to share with how your gaming week's been going?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Well, you remembered me this time.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I did. I'm sorry. How could I forget? You brought me cake.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Meghan says that you're a skanky, skanky hoe bag.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Yeah, I know. No, no, she said Rob is.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Hey, why am I a skanky hoe bag?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
That's her way of saying she loves you.

17:41.000 --> 17:41.000
Oh, okay.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
Hugs and kisses and smoothies to you, sweetie.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
Okay, aside from Sins 2, I got Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate 2 Dark Alliance.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
I found them on Amazon for each, like, 60 bucks, but I got them new.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Did it have a monkey on the cover?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
No, it didn't. Shut up.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
I've been playing both of those because I never got to finish both of them.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Go for the eyes.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
So, yeah. I like it.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
That was my gaming week.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
All right. Right on.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And I burned my fingernail, lighting your candles.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Okay, well, I guess now that everybody, now, I didn't miss anyone this week.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yes, we're good? All right.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I guess we can start, I missed the ferret. My bad.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I guess we can get into some housekeeping news tonight.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
First, if you haven't noticed, it is our 200th episode.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
We're cheating the number a little bit.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
This isn't our 200th podcast, per se, but it's probably well over our 100th regular podcast.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
But the deal is that we started as a live 365 station back in May of 2002 with our first show airing June 23, 2002.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
It was our first live show.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
And when we started Orange Launch Radio, originally the concept was we're going to be a DDR station.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
We're going to be about Bomani games.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
And we wanted to be the station that was like, we don't want to just talk about the Bomani news,

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
but we're going to be like that group of people that's at the diner after playing,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
you know, meeting up at the arcade for a night or like a tournament after DDR tournament

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
and just sitting around talking shit, talking about DDR, but talking shit and talking about games as well.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
And of course, over the years, we were one of the first internet broadcasts to get on the podcasting bandwagon

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
with the first Orange Launch Radio To Go edition debuting in January of 2005.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Keep in mind iTunes didn't support podcasts until June of 2005,

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
so we were pretty lucky in discovering that technology pretty early and we started doing a special show there.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
And then in January of this year, 2006, we combined our already existing live show and our podcast effort into this,

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
our live and podcast show, which runs live every Sunday night and then is podcasted to the world twice a week.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
So we think we're justified in the 200 number because this is about the 200th regular week

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
we've been putting out some type of gaming-related programming out there.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Not to mention all the live shows that we've done, special shows and fuck-off shows.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Exactly. We've been live at E3. We were live at Arena this year for E3.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
We were live at the B3 DDR tournament. We were live at a Scandia tournament.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Weren't we live at Milpitas once, Golfland for DDR tournament?

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
I think we were. Just a bunch of crazy shit we've been doing throughout the years with DDR community.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And now, general gaming as well. We know our fan base has now expanded past just those who are into music games.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And of course, we'll never forget our love of music games. We always have plenty of news.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Of course, we have the DDR sneak peeks tonight. I think that just further goes to show that.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
We haven't forgotten our roots.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Konami finally noticed us like two months ago. It's kind of amazing. So now we have all of that.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
So it's great. We've been so thankful to all the success we've had over the past 200 episodes.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
And we don't plan on quitting anytime soon.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
We did also break the Akira Yamaoka tracks.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
That's right. That was one big thing. That was one big thing was that we had a new Akira track that we were playing on the show.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
That was a big thing for us. We interviewed some DDR artists last year. It was pretty awesome.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
So lots of accomplishments. It's really all thanks to you guys in the chat room and the fans. You guys are just awesome.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
But anyway, we're going to save some of the crying and the tears for later in the show because we have a little surprise towards the end.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
So we'll do that a little later.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
For now, the other housekeeping. Now, this isn't such a happy note that we have to get into, but this shit happens.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Part of what we do at Orange Lounge Radio is that we're not afraid to report on things when we hear about it.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
If we sense that there's a bit of legitimacy to a news story, we're going to run with it.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I think we're kind of starting to turn into at least my vision.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
And I think the vision Dark Soccer and Loki have as well is that we want to be like an ain't it cool news of gaming.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
We're not afraid to run the rumors when we sense there's some bit of legitimacy to them.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
And we want to scoop the big, big media reports and things of that nature.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
But unfortunately, once in a while, something's going to happen that causes us to be wrong.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
And unfortunately, this time it happens to be a big one.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
And this was a story that was picked up on a lot of news sites that we ran. Loki, what happened?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
And this isn't really our fault.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
No, it's not.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
But you guys have to understand, this is what's going to happen when we do this.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Ain't it cool news right all the time? Hell no they're not.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And stuff changes all the time.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
It's just like when we report dates and stuff. Dates change all the time.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
But anyways, this is about the Phantasy Star Universe online subscription fees.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
Before we reported that the Xbox 360 version would be free and the Playstation 2 and PC would be pay.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
Well, Sega went back on what they decided to do and they're deciding to charge for the online service.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
And here is exactly why they're doing it.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
And this is straight from an email from our sales rep from Sega.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
It says, anyways, I just wanted to update you on what's going on regarding the subscription service we have with Phantasy Star Universe.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
As you know, the game will have an extensive 40 hour single player mode as well as online questing mode that allows players to create a character,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
customize that character and meet up with other players to complete quests online.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
The single player portion is separate from the online mode and it will work as normal on Playstation 2, Xbox 360 and PC.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
The online mode, however, is a bit different.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
To play online, the user will have to create an account with Sega and pay a monthly fee of $9.99.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
This will be required for all versions of the game, including the 360 version.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
Previously, we had thought the 360 version would not have a fee due to the Xbox Live fees.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
That has since changed.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
The good news is, this is nothing new for Phantasy Star Universe in that all online versions of Phantasy Star have had this fee in the past

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
and that even the last Xbox version which played over live.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
Also, we're trying to implement a 14 day free trial for the Playstation 2 version.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Our Japanese dev team has found that this free trial could lead to certain types of cheating

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
and now there's a chance that that free trial will not be included in the Playstation 2 version.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I will update you as I get final word on this.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Regarding the 360 version, Xbox Live prevents us from doing any type of free trial.

23:46.000 --> 23:54.000
However, the good news is that we have a marketplace demo that will allow users to get a small taste of the offline and online portions of the game.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
It says I know subscription fees are not a very common thing for the console games and that's why I wanted to inform you of this.

23:59.000 --> 24:08.000
Well, unfortunate, but Sega told us one thing and then told us another, but as you can understand, you know they were considering it.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
They were considering it and I think what it comes down to is that they found out they can charge for it and so they went ahead and did it.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
A lot of negative feedback from chat, people saying they're not going to get the game now because they don't pay for MMOs monthly.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
I'm with them on that. I was going to buy the game and to be honest, I'm not really interested anymore.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I'm interested in the marketplace demo. I'm going to make my decision solely based off the demo.

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
I am encouraged that at least the demo they're going to put on marketplace will support on and offline and that will be the decision maker for me.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
I'll pay for MMOs. I paid for World of Warcraft. I paid for Final Fantasy XI. I'm not against paying for MMOs.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
It's got to be good and I want to try it before I buy it.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
Here's the thing I don't understand about the MMOs is they have this infrastructure for these MMOs on live supposedly, but yet no one's really using it.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Same with Final Fantasy XI, you have to pay for online service.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
I wish there was an MMO that I didn't have to pay for the online portion because that's why I don't buy the games.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I don't have Guild Wars.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
They don't have Guild Wars on the 360. That's why I don't play MMOs on the 360 because I don't have the time to dedicate to play it regularly.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
I don't want to pay this extra monthly fee because I know I'm not going to use it.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
Whereas with Phantasy Star I figured, okay, I get to buy it and I can play online whenever I want. Awesome! That sold it for me.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
But now this news, right when I saw it I was like, fuck! I knew this was something that was going to possibly happen.

25:32.000 --> 25:39.000
Not a huge surprise since they've been charging all the time, but whatever. Life goes on I guess.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Kind of unfortunate. Jamie, I'm really curious about your thoughts because you're a big Phantasy Star supporter.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
I imagine you're probably going to play this anyway, but what do you think about all this back and forth, paying, no paying stuff?

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
I think half of it is that they're charging because, well, first of all they're in the business to make money, so why shouldn't they charge?

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
But regardless, and actually Ronma made this point in the chat room, it's still one of the cheapest MMOs you can play.

26:01.000 --> 26:13.000
I think that if charging the fee might lead to better service, give them more money for development into the game to expand it later on, that's my hope.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
But I really don't care because I was going to play it anyway.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
I figured if you want to play something bad enough, no price should keep you from enjoying it.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
Alright, well we'll see. We encourage your emails if you want to give us some feedback on this. Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
I imagine some people might be kind of pissed at us for reporting the news before, but you know what guys?

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
We had certainly a big reason to believe it was true because Sega told us.

26:41.000 --> 26:51.000
If you are unhappy with that, sorry. I guess you can stick to getting press releases and things when everybody else gets them and won't know any news beforehand.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
But to Loki's credit, a lot of the rest of that story has turned out to be right on.

26:57.000 --> 27:06.000
When it comes to a lot of the stories about the Wii that we're going to get into tonight and the GT steering wheel and some of the other things that you reported in that story are coming true.

27:06.000 --> 27:26.000
We can't predict the future. If they go and change what their plan is for something, we're not going to know. It's up to them. So if they decide to go back on what they want to charge, we can't be right all the time when it comes to them changing stuff.

27:26.000 --> 27:35.000
As we mentioned, there was a lot of big news this week about this little system coming out from Nintendo called Wii.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
We're dedicating just about the rest of the segment to talk about this because there was so much news that came with the Wii.

27:42.000 --> 27:55.000
So of course if you've been living in a cave or for some reason you only get your gaming news from OLR, which is kind of cool I guess, here's the deal. The Wii is coming out on November 19th and it's coming out for a price of $250.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
$249.99.

27:58.000 --> 28:09.000
With after-tax it's going to be over $250. It's going to be packaged with Wii Sports. Controllers will be sold separately. The Wiimote, which is the official name for it it sounds like, the Wiimote is going to be what?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
The remote and nunchuck.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
The Wiimote is going to be $40 and the nunchuck is going to be $20. That was everything that was announced at the press conference.

28:19.000 --> 28:29.000
Pretty much the price point it looks like right now is the remote is going to be $39.99 whereas the attachments are going to be $19.99.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Who called the price? That would be me.

28:32.000 --> 28:43.000
Good job. Now a lot of people are saying the controllers are too damn expensive. But I didn't, I mean okay because when you consider it's the nunchuck and the controller it's going to be about $60.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
You don't have to buy the nunchuck. You do not have to have it. A lot of games do not use it unless it's like a first person shooter.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Plus I do believe isn't a wireless Xbox 360 controller $49?

28:53.000 --> 29:01.000
It's $49.99 and that's not even with the rechargeable, granted the Wii does not have a rechargeable battery pack at least as far as I'm aware.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
2 AA's but it does last quite a long time apparently and so I don't know.

29:08.000 --> 29:15.000
I'm not trying to knock Xbox 360's price at all. I'm just saying you know Nintendo doesn't see that but a lot of people were very disappointed in the price that they heard.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
And I thought it was kind of like well isn't that what kind of everyone was expecting? I guess some people have their sights on $200.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
But I don't know I want to say I swear to God I said on this show previously I bet you anything Wii Sports is a pack-in game.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
And people were telling me no because they haven't done a pack-in game in years.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
No Wii Sports is like it's not gamey enough to be a game but it's good enough to be a pack-in game.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
It's just like world class track meet. That's exactly what it is to me. It's world class track meet.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
It's also something that's very simple that will teach you how to use the controller and stuff like that.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Exactly. Alright well we have plenty of Wii news all around the table tonight so.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
Well there is a bit more about Wii Sports. Again it is going to be bundled in with the Wii at release.

29:55.000 --> 30:04.000
But there's been suggestions especially actually it states that for EGM that it was going to support over 30 different games.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
But the official ones listed are tennis, baseball, golf, bowling and boxing.

30:09.000 --> 30:20.000
And it's all pretty much the same simple thing. Like for anyone who watched the press release it's pretty much the same type style of thing that you saw in the press release.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Okay.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
I guess bowling is a sport.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Bowling will be kind of fun.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
I wonder if it will have curling.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Tennis wasn't bad but again I bet baseball will be a lot of fun with multiple people.

30:32.000 --> 30:38.000
And you know I think the concept and the reason why the remote costs so much and watching the Wii press event and everything.

30:39.000 --> 30:46.000
I think the concept is you're going to build your personality on your Wii remote thing and you want to take it to other places right?

30:47.000 --> 30:59.000
Well actually it's stating that in particular for Wii Sports is that you're going to use your I guess the Wii caricature to play in the games that you can actually play versus people that will personalize the game for you.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
So I don't think that Nintendo wants you to buy four Wiimotes for your household.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
They want you and all three of your friends to buy Wiis and then you bring your Wiimote with you like you bring your iPod with you everywhere to share music.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
You're going to bring your Wiimote and I guess I'm also being corrected in chat that's not the real name.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It's going to be the Wii remote but I don't care it's a Wii remote or Wiimote.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I still like Wecon.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
I think they use Wiimote actually.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I swear I heard in that press conference somebody say Wiimote but whatever it doesn't matter.

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
So whatever that thing is the thing you're going to take the thing with you to other people's houses and then you know your characters on there ready to go.

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
Didn't we already reveal on the show previously in some news article that it had some type of storage on the actual remote itself.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
So it probably saves basic stats and things like you know you go to your friend's house and oh hey you're four and two in baseball right now let's play you know.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Sort of be like bringing your memory card with you.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Or your DS.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Yeah I think that's exactly what it is so I don't know.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
Anyways well some other interesting things about the Wii in Japan of course which was the first news that we got about the Wii.

32:03.000 --> 32:12.000
It's going to be launching for 25,000 yen and what's kind of interesting though is they are not getting the pack in for Wii Sports.

32:12.000 --> 32:22.000
That is separate you have to buy that separately and that's actually going to cost around 3,800 actually I'm sorry 3,800 yen is going to be the price of the remote.

32:23.000 --> 32:33.000
1,800 for the nunchaku attachment and 1,800 for the classic controller which also by the way $19.99 for the classic controller in the United States.

32:34.000 --> 32:40.000
Wii Sports though is going to be a pretty inexpensive game so that should be pretty interesting.

32:40.000 --> 32:48.000
One of the other games I saw in there which is really cool Wii Play which is going to be for people that saw the E3 tech demos and stuff like the shooting demo.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Duck Hunt?

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Yeah I like the Duck Hunt game those are in Wii Play some of them so that's kind of cool.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
Hopefully we'll get in the states I know that UK is getting and stuff like that but should be interesting.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Camden in our chat room is making a little play on the whole me thing and put me a moto.

33:05.000 --> 33:15.000
You remember when you saw the E3 demo with all four of them playing and the little heads were on the bodies and they looked like Miyamoto and everything?

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
That was it because they had made their things on the me now it all makes sense so that's kind of interesting.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
I just want to ask a quick question.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
Why do you think Japan is not getting Wii Sports? Why do you think they opted not to do that and do a cheaper bundle instead without it?

33:30.000 --> 33:36.000
Just for economical reasons I actually stand a chance of making more money having the game separate.

33:37.000 --> 33:44.000
Also Japan is getting theirs on December 2nd which is surprising because they're not the first ones to launch with the Wii the United States is. Interesting.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
We're loved.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Heart Nintendo.

33:48.000 --> 34:02.000
Anyway as far as speaking of the Nintendo love this is in UK news. The Wii is going to retail for 249 euros which is 179 pounds in the UK.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
Also with it will be about 20 release games.

34:06.000 --> 34:24.000
It's Wii Play, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and some third party games like Red Steel, Need for Speed Carbon, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Pixar's Cars and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
That sounds kind of fun.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Also it will be bundled with Wii Sports as well.

34:30.000 --> 34:37.000
It will come with one Wii Remote, one Nunchuk and again Wii Sports.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I think it's funny that they're getting the...

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
I think it's interesting that Europe is not getting the shaft for once with the release time.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
I mean sure we're beating them to it but to be ahead of Japan that's weird to me that Japan isn't getting this thing until December.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
That is so weird to me.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Well actually it says that the European release date is the 8th of December.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Oh my bad. I thought it was before. I'm sorry.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
My bad, my bad. Okay so Europe did get the shaft. Sorry guys.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
It's not that bad.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
It's not as bad as the usual Nintendo shaft. It's not as bad so I guess there's that.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
And I understand why they're doing it because they're launching so many units in the United States.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
They've got to catch up, make sure they have enough for it to launch in the other territories.

35:19.000 --> 35:28.000
Well it's also going to of course, we'll be going into a little bit more about this later, of course we'll have the Wii channel menu and a pretty interesting interface.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Alright. Well if you want to spin your globe all the way around and take a look at Australia.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Australia's launch looks pretty comparable to what Europe's getting.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
The console's going to launch there on December 7th, 2006.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
The retail price will be $399.95 but that's Australian.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
And then they're also going to have Wii Sports as their pack-in game.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
And of course all the other good stuff you've been hearing about with the interface and everything.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Nothing too different there. But Australia's not being left out of the worldwide launch.

35:59.000 --> 36:07.000
So it looks like Nintendo has this worldwide launch thing down where Sony with their whole worldwide means Japan and the U.S. only might need to...

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
Sony just makes it easy to bash on them. I really don't want to.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Well my question for Nintendo is what about Africa?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Where is that only the domain of Sony now?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Africa.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Well maybe we'll hear something on that later, I don't know.

36:24.000 --> 36:31.000
We all know that Mr. Kuragis meets crayons and wears a helmet so we can't be too upset at him.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
I will be curious to see again, I think like most PlayStation consoles, and I don't want to get off topic too much,

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
but like most PlayStation consoles, I don't think we'll truly be able to judge the PlayStation 3 until this time next year.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
I really don't think we're going to start seeing the big guns until then, but whatever.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I guess it's all about launch now. Now, now, now. Especially in this internet age.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I mean how fast did people want their information on that Wii launch?

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
Now, now, now. People tuning into June video streams thinking they were current because they had to have it now, now, now

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
and something gets dug and then everybody believes it. It's crazy!

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
The internet has fucked things up! Totally!

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Well, at least we were right about the launch date. We said soon.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah, we did say soon. We did.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
I did say November. I gave you a couple weeks in November.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
Meg Z got an exact date. I think I should point that out.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I saw her call that on her live journal. That was cool.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
She was really, really happy about that.

37:25.000 --> 37:33.000
I do want to point out, Loki, in your thing you did on 198, you were one of the first people to say, hey, Nintendo is debating launching after Sony.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
Because most people, when they were guessing the launch date, were guessing things before the 17th.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
You were one of the first people to say they are thinking about doing it after.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
To be honest, all the dates in our system that we had, all the launch dates were on the 15th of November.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
And I was like, that's got to be a to be announced date because there's no way that they would launch it at the same time as Sony.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
And here I was wrong the whole time. It was right in front of my face.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
But, whatever. Who cares? It's just a fun little game until the system actually launches.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
Rama in our chat regarding the Wii launch in Africa says, fuck them, send Africa refurbished N64s.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
That's not nice. Have Ellen give out some Wiis.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Have Ellen give out some Wiis to Africa.

38:15.000 --> 38:15.000
I hate Ellen.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
We'll send Sudan Summers there with food for the starving children and Wiis.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
You guys, she gave away to a blind guy. What the hell is he going to do with that?

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
There's lots of areas to Africa and I'm sure some of them are waiting and willing for their Wiis. They want it.

38:31.000 --> 38:39.000
I actually did go searching for the date. I could not find it, but I would imagine given that the majority of the world is getting theirs in December, theirs is probably close to the same time.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
If not, then early next year. I'm sure you will have your Wiis soon enough, Africa.

38:44.000 --> 38:53.000
As we mentioned before, I believe we talked about this, it came out that the Wii will not support DVD playback.

38:54.000 --> 39:01.000
What we were told, of course, before is that they're going to have an add-on little thing for it, kind of like the Xbox did where you'd be able to play DVDs.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Well, they've opted on not doing that at all.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
In fact, it says Nintendo of America's Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Affairs Perrin Kaplan confirmed to IGN,

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
Wii today, that its forthcoming Wii console will not play Hollywood DVD movies.

39:18.000 --> 39:25.000
The decision to remove the functionality was made in order to deliver the machine at cheaper costs because most people today already own DVD players.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
And to be honest, it makes perfect sense. The GameCube didn't play DVDs and I wasn't sad about it, so who cares?

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
You know what's interesting about this? This is a direct opposite philosophy to what Sony is doing, if you think about it, right?

39:38.000 --> 39:46.000
Because Sony is saying, oh no, you need Blu-ray. We need to put Blu-ray in here because you need your Blu-ray movie playback, because you need to see your movies in 1080.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
You need to do this. Isn't it kind of interesting?

39:50.000 --> 40:00.000
You know what, I think that's very smart because their whole point is gameplay. Making games. Not making, oh, we do all this other crap too.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Well, hold on though.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
How many of us in this room own a DVD player?

40:05.000 --> 40:15.000
Well, we all do. I use my Xbox 360, really. But hold on, hold on though, and I don't want to spoil the interface story that's coming up, but there are things that are in the interface that aren't only strictly games, right?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
So there's a little something extra.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
That is true, but I still think that the focus is on games and should stay that way.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
That's why I think that Sony is shooting themselves in the balls.

40:26.000 --> 40:35.000
I think it's more of a cost of technology thing, where it's like, why pay for the DVD player to be in there? Maybe these other little frills we can add on the technology we already have, but why pay to have the DVD stuff in there?

40:36.000 --> 40:43.000
If you want to know who to blame for DVD playback not being in there, it's pretty much Hollywood anyways, because you have to license the DVD playback.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Listen, I didn't catch this. Why did Nintendo tell you there was going to be a dongle and now they didn't?

40:48.000 --> 40:57.000
That's because of the licensing for DVD playback. You have to pay for licensing fees, and that's why they charge for that stuff, because it covers the cost of licensing. That's why Xbox did the same thing.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
It's not because it can't. It's just because, well, you know, it's just not going to. I got you. I got you.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
Well, as far as... we are just so Wii-centric today, aren't we?

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Well, for this part...

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
It's the hugest thing in gaming right now. When we get into Part B, we'll have some non-Wii stuff, but we've got to get this out.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
I just said that so that I could use Wii-centric in a sentence.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Cute.

41:21.000 --> 41:31.000
Regarding more Wii games, actually they have announced a Resident Evil game for the Wii titled Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles.

41:32.000 --> 41:41.000
It's produced by Masachika Kawata, who was also the one who ported RE4 to PlayStation 2.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
I have to make this crack. Resident Evil.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Resident Evil!

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Go to hell!

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
And take your toilet paper joke book with you.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
It survived for this long.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Resident Evil. God.

41:58.000 --> 42:07.000
Well, Capcom was saying that they were supposed to combine the gaming experience and atmosphere, but involve the Wii control system with it.

42:07.000 --> 42:16.000
They're still not leaving any details. It's still saying it's an action game, still is going to use the Wii-con, but they're not really giving any more detail.

42:17.000 --> 42:26.000
However, another game that we did get some detail on was Forever Blue, which is a diving game that will be coming out for Wii.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
That sounds interesting. I love those little quirky games.

42:31.000 --> 42:40.000
Resident Evil 4 was badass on the GameCube and was really the last kick in the butt that system had in the right direction.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
What do you think? Is Resident Evil Wii going to be like, holy crap, Nintendo's not just cutesy things?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I have a feeling it's going to do that.

42:48.000 --> 43:00.000
There's also another game that was mentioned, Hajime Tano Wii, which means starting out with Wii. It's supposed to be one of the launch titles, and it's supposed to be a bunch of mini-games with the Duck Hunt.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Are you guys getting used to that name now? Wii?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
I think it's cute.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
I don't know. I think it's the right thing. I think Nintendo's making a lot of smart decisions here. I'll get into it later.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
What was it that I said months ago?

43:12.000 --> 43:12.000
What?

43:12.000 --> 43:24.000
The whole point of advertising. When you come up with a name for something, you need something memorable, something that people are going to talk about, something simple, and it fits all three.

43:25.000 --> 43:36.000
And boy, the internet would not shut up about Wii. Check any game blog or major gaming site or little gaming site, and it was Wii Wii Wii, unless it was an Xbox or Sony site. It was all about the Wii all this week.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
There is rarely such a thing as bad press. I always say rarely, not ever.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
You know, look at Sony and E3.

43:42.000 --> 43:49.000
You get confused about how many people are like, ooh, what's that, or that sounds so weird, let me check it out. I'm curious now. Ooh, Wii.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Interesting. Interesting.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
When you are having fun, you refer to yourself and some other people. Wii.

43:57.000 --> 44:06.000
Interesting. All right. Well, one game I'm sure we're all going to have a lot of fun with on the Wii is the Twilight Princess, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which, by the way, was delayed a little bit on GameCube.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
It's not coming out the exact same day as Wii Link. It's coming out, what, December something.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I'm sure Chatham is going to yell it out.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
I want to say December 8th for some reason. It sticks out of my mind. I don't know why. Maybe that's because it was the Europe launch. I don't know.

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
But anyway, what's interesting is that there's a pretty big difference between the GameCube version and the Wii version of Twilight Princess, and that is how Link is holding his sword.

44:27.000 --> 44:42.000
Miyamoto stated that Link was initially supposed to have a left-handed sword in the Wii version of Twilight Princess, but he has that in the GameCube version, and they changed it so that he uses a sword in the right hand on the Wii because of the fact that most people are right-handed.

44:43.000 --> 44:52.000
Well, I always thought it was very strange having Link be left-handed anyway, because isn't it in Japan it's sort of a thing where a lot of parents will train their children to be right-handed?

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
Being left-handed is very, I guess, considered not very normal.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Chat room's all yelling December 11th, by the way. Thank you, chat room.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
Why can't they make Tingle less gay, then? If they can teach Link to use the other hand.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
Hey, Tingle ain't coming out here. I can say this because I think on gaygamer.net I want to say was the site.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
They're starting a petition right now to get Tingle out over here because right now it's not planned for release over here.

45:15.000 --> 45:26.000
The Tingle Adventure, that uber-gay guy in the, well at least we all think he is, in that GameCube Four Swords Adventures.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
He flies by on a balloon and goes, ooh, ooh, and drops rupees on you.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Well, he was actually in Wind Waker.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Oh, that's right. All right, thank you. I just remember him from Four Swords.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
I'm going to have to import that because I like, um, yeah.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
You like to feel a little Tingle?

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
No, I just like, I like the gay.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Anyway, speaking of, no, I'm sorry, not speaking.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
The interface for the Wii, we've got some very interesting things going on.

45:58.000 --> 46:11.000
There is, excuse me, as I die over here, there is going to be, it's actually based on Opera for their web browser.

46:12.000 --> 46:19.000
There's a weather channel, a news channel, and then there's one called Mii Channel, M-I-I for those who haven't got the joke yet.

46:19.000 --> 46:29.000
With the Mii Channel, you can use it to customize your avatar, and also your avatar will show up in the various demos.

46:30.000 --> 46:39.000
You can actually store everything on your Wii Remote, so you will actually be taking your Wii Remote to other people's houses and play.

46:39.000 --> 46:52.000
Which I've been listening to some other podcasts kind of, you know, not getting that part of it, and I'm just kind of thinking, I'm like, that's the whole trick.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
It's not that you're going to have four controllers in your own house, it's that everybody's going to have their own controller.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
The controller is going to be like the, you know, the thing that defines me, and then the Wii is just the box you play the games on.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
And also the characters, you don't actually have to play as them, they can also populate, you know, say other games, like Animal Crossing or something like that.

47:10.000 --> 47:18.000
Where you can create, you know, characters, like for example, they showed the demo for, where they're creating Samuel L. Jackson.

47:18.000 --> 47:37.000
There actually, if anyone is interested, there are videos up on Eurogamer.net, linked over from Eurogamer TV, that give demonstrations of how these various screens and channels are going to work on the Wii.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
So I recommend checking those out.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Very cool. And I know I saw some on Wii.com too.

47:42.000 --> 47:42.000
Oh yeah.

47:43.000 --> 47:43.000
I have some good stuff too.

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
I want to point out this comment, and I know I'm not supposed to say these words because they were banned, but it's a funny comment.

47:50.000 --> 47:58.000
Sayoran108 in our chatroom says, Tingle gets more guys than G4.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Oh!

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
In regards to Tingle.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Eww.

48:04.000 --> 48:15.000
Anyways, alright. As Jamie mentioned earlier, there's a brand new Wii game, which kind of, I guess, roughly translates to My First Wii.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
And the game's actually going to be bundled with a Wiimote.

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
And it will be, yes, My First Wii. Everybody poops!

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
No, no, that's translated that wrong. This is starting with Wii.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Starting with Wii.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
Starting with Wii, and then you go to poo.

48:34.000 --> 48:49.000
So, yeah, it's going to be bundled together with 4800 yen, making it cheaper than a standard controller, which would be 5800 yen.

48:49.000 --> 49:06.000
So that's actually kind of cool. And it's set for the Japanese release on December 2nd, and will include, of course, minigames designed to make players familiar with the Wii remote controls, including pinball, table hockey, and pool.

49:06.000 --> 49:19.000
Simple point-and-click shooting games, and other games that are modeled after the demos shown at E3, including a minigame where you move your Mii caricature around a city block.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
So, interesting.

49:23.000 --> 49:33.000
Now, one thing that the Wii is going to be able to do that is kind of interesting, and it's kind of interesting that Xbox 360 doesn't do this, and I don't know if PlayStation has plans to do this, but that's surfing the web.

49:33.000 --> 49:41.000
And I can see where Xbox 360 doesn't do this, because they want you to go use Windows on your PC to go surf the internet, but Nintendo, they don't have a PC stake, so they say,

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
fuck that, you're going to surf the web on our system, and they're going to use the Opera browser to do it.

49:47.000 --> 49:59.000
But here's the thing, they said during the press conference that users will be downloading the Opera browser with Wii Points, which is kind of their version of money into points into being able to buy stuff on their thing.

49:59.000 --> 50:06.000
But the nice thing about it is that actually they're not going to charge for the browser until June of next year.

50:07.000 --> 50:14.000
No idea why they're doing it that way. I thought at first when I read this, this meant that the browser wasn't going to be out until June of next year, but that's not what the internet seems to be reporting right now.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
It seems to be saying that, yeah, the Opera browser will be there, and you can download it free, but in June of next year you're going to have to pay for it.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
So, I guess a bonus incentive to early adopters of the Wii?

50:23.000 --> 50:34.000
I guess. The other thing too is, I mean, it's probably not that expensive to develop the Opera browser, and since it's normally free anyways, that's probably why they're charging after.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
It's kind of like the whole thing that they did with Texas Hold'em, where it's free for four years.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Yeah, but Texas Hold'em was free for two days. This is going to be free for about seven months.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
Well, you know, not a lot of people are going to be really jumping to download the browser.

50:48.000 --> 50:57.000
Because, I mean, if you think about it, to browse the internet, you've really got to have a wireless setup and all that stuff for the Wii.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
Well, wait, but isn't the Wii supposed to have the wireless thing built into it, just like your DS, so that all you have to have is a wireless router in your house and it'll go?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Exactly, but still though, not a lot of people have that, I would think.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Do you think people without wireless internet are going to be screwed, or do you think there will be a dongle?

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
No, there's going to be a USB type of thing.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Same with the DS.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
That's what I figured.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Well, speaking of things that are screwed up, Monkey Ball.

51:21.000 --> 51:30.000
Okay, Monkey Ball is just one of those crazy games that's out there, and of course, as everyone knows by now, there is Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz that will be out on the Wii.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
They're introducing two new characters, one called Yanyan and one called Doctor.

51:35.000 --> 51:47.000
Yanyan is a female monkey, and Yanyan is an older monkey with a past steeped in mystery due to his acute case of amnesia.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
Is his name Doctor Sayus?

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
It just says Doctor.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
In my head, I'm a Doctor Who fan girl, so every time I see Doctor, I think, David Tennant? No!

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
Now I have this image of David Tennant dressed as a monkey in my head. I can't.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
And now I need to wash my brain.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
David Tennant's hot, but anyway.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Okie dokie.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
So is Billy Piper.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Back to the story.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
There's also, each of these characters are going to have different strengths and weaknesses.

52:16.000 --> 52:24.000
Things that affect acceleration, speed, jumping, also the weight and size of the ball that they are in is going to affect how it's played.

52:24.000 --> 52:34.000
Actually, you use the ball in different ways. You can flick the remote, you can press a button, different things that you do with the remote are going to affect how the balls move.

52:35.000 --> 52:42.000
And there's also a bunch of mini games. It will be out on December 2nd in Japan.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
Sorry, the grade schooler in me is using the Wii to make your balls move. It's just too much for me.

52:49.000 --> 52:49.000
Too much for me.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
It will be a launch game in all territories.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I just want to say some chat comments real quick.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Pooeater on the Opera story in our chat room says,

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Why would you want the internet on your console which has to run from your computer's internet connection?

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
I don't know. There's something to be said about multiple browser windows. Maybe mom wants one browsing window and you want one. I don't know.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
And also, I mean browsing from your couch and porn! Come on!

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Oh, I can't wait to put porn on my Wii.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
Ravenstolphin wanted to correct me and say that PlayStation 3 does indeed have a browser in it. Thank you. I couldn't remember.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
I figured as much because PSP has one, but I couldn't remember for sure.

53:24.000 --> 53:34.000
Anyway, speaking of the browser, they are testing the online service, or I should say it's rumored that they are beta testing the online service right now.

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
And this, I don't know how reputable this is, but this is according to a poster on the MacRumors forum.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
I have problems with that right there.

53:43.000 --> 54:01.000
Anyways, who has fairly reputable history when it comes to Nintendo related information, saying that the beta test is running from September 18th until October 23rd, and the test will be covering the Wii Connect 24, Virtual Console, and other online features.

54:01.000 --> 54:12.000
Right. Okay, so they're beta testing the online service. Great. That's something that they need to do. Since the console is coming out pretty soon.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Yay for MacMan.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
What?

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
I'm the only Mac fangirl in the house, so I have a Mac.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
No, that's not true. I like Macs. I have a Mac.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I'm getting my, um, did you see the 24-inch iMacs?

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
The bigger the better.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Why do you need them that big?

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
For art?

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
I'm being told that that's not a rumor and that's the truth, apparently.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
They're the 24-inch widescreen iMac.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Are you compensating for something?

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
No, I have no.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
My internet penis knows no bounds.

54:46.000 --> 54:55.000
Moving on, another question that still is up for debate right now, we have not really gotten a clear answer on this story, and it has to do with the region free.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Is the damn thing going to be region free or not?

54:57.000 --> 55:08.000
It seems to be that it's America versus the rest of the world, I mean Nintendo of America versus Nintendo of the rest of the world, debating on whether the damn thing is going to be region free or not.

55:09.000 --> 55:16.000
Basically what happened is that, ok, Perrin Kaplan, who is the VP of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, she said that yes, like the Nintendo DS, the Wii is going to be free.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
But then, I believe some guy from Europe said that it is not going to be region free.

55:22.000 --> 55:31.000
I guess to further say what Perrin was saying is that she was saying, well, first party games will be region free, but we'll leave it up to the third party folks what they want to do.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
What the hell?

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
GameSpot ran this whole little rumor control thing, hey, we were in that once, about was it true or not.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
They said that getting answers from Nintendo proved difficult during one of the company's busiest days of the year.

55:45.000 --> 55:55.000
However, after a lengthy exchange of cryptic emails, a rep finally confirmed that Kaplan's words regarding regionless first party titles and potentially regionless third party titles was indeed correct.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
The Wii will be region free.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So Nintendo of America is convinced the damn thing is going to be region free.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
So I don't know why the rest of the world isn't on the same page.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
I hope so because I want to get Wii Play and my first Wii.

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
And if something like, you know, Oh and Don comes out for the Wii, damn well I'm going to believe I want that shit.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
But you know what though?

56:15.000 --> 56:20.000
I have a feeling that even if it's not, we're going to get something like what came out on the GameCube.

56:21.000 --> 56:28.000
The thing that basically overrode the region thing is swapped out the disk.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
The freeloader.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
The freeloader.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Using little hacks to do it.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Especially if Nintendo is letting you on the internet with their console.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
You know what a huge fucking hole that's going to be, I bet, to hackers.

56:41.000 --> 56:50.000
The whole thing about Nintendo is that theirs has been, all of their systems have been the easiest to play imports on.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
You know, for Super Famicom games all you needed to do was find like an old gyromite.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
Not for Super Famicom, but for Famicom you needed an old gyromite and you could plug it in.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Or with the Super Nintendo you break out two little tabs, plug it in.

57:05.000 --> 57:13.000
With the Nintendo 64, they sold actually a little tool that you could unscrew and then you pop another tab, put it in.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Theirs were all physical lockouts until they started moving to a digital format.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
And then with that it was still something as easy as loading a code.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
It was like the Dreamcast, how easy that was.

57:25.000 --> 57:32.000
And then I have a feeling that even if they go back and it's all region coded, they're still going to have some way to bypass that.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And I really don't think Nintendo's going to care.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
They haven't cared before, really. Why should they really care?

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
Bobby Blackwolf's in our chat right now. He does his own show over on AllGames.com.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
I'm sure if you've listened to this show for any length of time you've heard us pimp him before.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
He ran the same story on his show tonight, except he was reading Joystiq's version of it.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
And I guess Joystiq talked to Nintendo as well and they told him, no, it's not region free.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
So, shit, even with Nintendo of America, they don't know.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
So, we won't know until the damn thing comes out, it sounds like.

58:05.000 --> 58:12.000
You know what, though, I'm still really, I can't be too upset about that because there's going to be a way.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Yeah, there'll be a way.

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
Even if Nintendo doesn't do something, even if we don't have a developer do something, there is going to be some importer on the net,

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
the same people who probably figured out how to do the seven swap trick on the old PlayStation, who will figure out a way to play it.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
Well, it's just like the Xbox 360 games, there are some that come out that are region free and then you can import them.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
You just won't know until they come out.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
I guess it's one of those things they didn't think people were going to ask about.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
What do you mean you want games from other regions? What the hell is wrong with you?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
They know there are importers there.

58:47.000 --> 58:52.000
I remember paying $125 for the Sailor Moon S fighting game back in 1995.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Because you're fucking sick.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
And I mean that with lots of love.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
This was when it was brand new and I had to pay import fees.

59:02.000 --> 59:08.000
And I paid for it and I bought it and I played the hell out of it and sold it back used for $60 after two years.

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
But still, there are people out there who will lay down the money and will do what it takes to get their imports out.

59:15.000 --> 59:23.000
Cool. Anyways, some of the news that was coming out of Japan was actually a huge list of games that they're going to be getting for the Wii.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I thought there was a lot of stuff that was very interesting in there.

59:27.000 --> 59:33.000
Some of the titles, at least the highlights on there, some to be announced titles for example.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
There's an action game and an action RPG that's being worked on from software.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
A baseball game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, so that might be interesting.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Bomberman Land.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Smash Brothers, which of course we knew was coming.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Disaster, also another Nintendo game.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
Donkey Kong Tarou Jet Race, which is going to be coming out in 2007.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Dragon Quest Sword.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearer from Square Enix.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
A new Fire Emblem game from Nintendo.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
As well as Harry Potter from EA.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Mario Party 8, not a big surprise there.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Mario Strikers Charge, which had been previously announced.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This one I thought was very interesting.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Music Simulation Game, of course a working title from Konami Digital Entertainment.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
So, very interesting there.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Of course, one of the things I was excited about, Simple Series is coming to the Wii.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So that's really cool.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And of course, The Dog Island by Yukez, which is going to be coming out in 2007.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Super Paper Mario confirmed to be coming out on the Wii, so that's pretty interesting.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
A soccer game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, maybe winning 11er Pro Evolution.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And then of course Pac-Man Carnival, sounds like a mini-game type of thing.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
One Piece Unlimited Adventure, and of course, Wii Music.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I have to ask, what do you think the Konami game is?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I have a crazy ass theory.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
What do you guys think?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You know, I don't know.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I got one more here, I don't know what this translates to.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
You might know this one, Jamie.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
What's it? Totsugeki Famicom Wars W.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I actually do not know what Totsugeki means.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Maybe someone in the chat knows.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Let me see.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Good job, Drunami!

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah, I was thinking, because I was like, that sounds familiar.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
My thought, okay, the Konami music game, just bear with me on this.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Since it's probably something new for the Wii, I would bet this series is cute enough for Nintendo.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I bet it's going to be some twisted form of pop and music.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But not with a controller like we know it.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
It's going to be like a different type of pop and music.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Theory.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Weird ass theory for me.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
No, theory here.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Motion sensing controller.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Music game.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Drummania.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
You think?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Actually, you know, they did have one of the demos at E3 was a drumming sim.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But isn't that Wii music thing supposed to be a separate game with the orchestra and that whole thing from Nintendo?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I don't think it has a drumming thing on there.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The Wii music is just the orchestra.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You know, Chatroom seems to think it's Para Para.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
We're not going to get Para Para. The whole Para Para train.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Well, but wait, this isn't for us. It's Japan we're talking about.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I'm saying, Para Para is pretty much dead in Japan.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It was a fad that lasted for like, what, five years?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Maybe it's something new.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Maybe it's like gongoro dancing or something, I don't know.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Unfortunately, the gongoro did not die with the Para Para.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Mambo gogo?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Mambo gogo would be cool.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
But anyway.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Well, speaking of other games, we have coming out for the Virtual Console, Hudson, who loves us so much.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
We'll be bringing 30 titles over for Virtual Console.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Some of them will be available at launch.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
They haven't listed exactly what.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
My speculation is we will be probably getting the Adventure Island series.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Probably the various Bomberman's.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Those are two I definitely think are going to be up there.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And Bonk.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I think I definitely.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Well, especially if they're doing turbo graphics.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
You cannot have turbo graphics without Bonk.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Or Air Zonk.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Or Air Zonk. That's another good one.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That's one that Junami suggested.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
But I still want my Adventure Island.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Well, another company is talking about games.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Coming over to the Wii, actually this one kind of leaked out from the ESRB ratings board there.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
We've got a listing for a bunch of different Wii titles for the Virtual Console.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Including Alter Beast, Columns, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Ristar, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Toejam and Earl.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
All of which are getting an E rating.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Oh God, I can't wait to play Toejam and Earl again.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
What do you think though about the whole $5, $8, $10 thing?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Do you think that's going to be worth it for those old games?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
They didn't really say where Genesis and Turbo Graphics fits into that though.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
They just said 500 points for the old games, 800 for the SNES, and 1000 for the later ones.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Nintendo 64.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I do though have to second something that was mentioned in the chat room.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Bob Coffee said we need to get Dracula X.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000
We have to get one of our biggest Nintendo fans on the Skyline right now because he's dying to comment on some of this.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
He knows a few things that we don't and we're going to see what we can get out of him here on the show.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
DMN, are you on the line?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Yeah, you got your $20 bills out?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Why, are you going to dance?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Maybe.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Did you dress up for this phone call?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Wait, what?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Did you dress up for this phone call?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
He's dressed sexy for episode 200.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I'm actually not wearing any clothes right now.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Alright, we got all types of wheeze on tonight's program.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
DMN, I know you're dying to comment on this.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
What do you think about all this news this week and now you can actually talk about some of the things you couldn't before I'm sure.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Yeah, a few things.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
One of the things I want to say is this is the most excited I've been for a console launch since about Nintendo 64.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I would agree with that except I would go as far back to say I have not been this excited about a console at launch, keeping those words in mind, at launch since Super Nintendo.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Yeah, that's another one.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:47.000
What I want to say about the Wii is having had a chance to dabble playing it a little bit, we did have a little demo thing over the week for all Nintendo employees.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
It's incredibly fun.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Elibits looks amazing.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Got a chance to try a demo of WarioWare which is amazing. It's really fun.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
What else can I do?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Madden 07, I got to play a couple plays of that and that may be the most fun anybody will have with a sim sports game ever.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Are you biased because you're on Reggie's payroll?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.000
No.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:12.000
No?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Swear to me?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I'm getting a 360 at some point. I'm just not getting a PS3.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So you're in the Wii 60 camp?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yes.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Fair enough. Well, what else? Anything else you can tell us about the Wii? Maybe? Little bits? Little hints?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I'm trying to see what I can-

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I don't want to get you fired so I understand if no.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:45.000
There's not really anything else I can talk about because I know just about as much as you guys do in some aspects, but there's some things I can't talk about because of obvious reasons.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Right.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
That's about it.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Okay. Well, that's cool. We'll take your word for it because you've probably seen the Wii more recently than any of the rest of us.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So you actually got hands on with Elibits because I saw it at the Konami thing, but I didn't get to play it really because all the Corp casts were hogging the shit out of it and we weren't really able to get on it.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I will say right here and now it will be a Katamari Damacy killer.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Oh, I don't know about that. I don't know about that.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
We'll put money on that with you, Rob.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Loki, you saw this too? You think Elibits is the Katamari killer?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I don't think so.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:19.000
No.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I don't think so.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
It's fun. It's going to appeal to the same type of people.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Yeah, I think it's going to appeal to the same crowd, but I don't think it will sell nearly as many copies.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
No, they do need to release Katamari for it, though.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:29.000
They do.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Yeah, it will be interesting.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But it won't be the same guy because he said he's not doing any more Katamari.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I guess that's true. Who cares?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Just hoard it.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
What makes you think that Elibits is a Katamari killer?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Just how incredibly fun it was. It was easy to just pick up and play. It took me maybe 30 seconds just to get used to what I was doing and it was clockwork from there.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It felt just as fun as a Katamari game and just as simple.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Isn't that how most Wii games are designed, though, that you just kind of pick it up and go?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Basically, for those who don't know, Elibits is basically a game where, let's say you're playing Half-Life 2 in just a random part of the neighborhood and the only thing you have is the gravity gun.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
That's pretty much what it is.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Interesting.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Will I be able to sell a Wii to my mom?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
If you want.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I mean, is this really the type of console that's going to appeal to everyone, you think?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Oh, absolutely. I've actually been telling my own mother about it who absolutely loves video games and she actually even seemed interested in trying it when I bought it.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So, I think that this is the direction that gaming needs to go. We need to be more part of the game rather than, you know, I don't want top-notch graphics. I don't want incredibly difficult controls. I just want a game I can pick up and play and enjoy and have fun with.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Okay. Interesting.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:09:00.000
That's why we're not seeing it as much as the 360 and from what Sony's doing, it's just not looking like it.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Alright. But what do you think might happen with Sony in a year? Because remember, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 launches, I think, for people who play the same type of games we do, you know, we're not really in the we buy Madden games the day they come out camp.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And granted, there's a great fan base for that and I'm not knocking that if that's what you're into.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000
But do you think that maybe for us who are more of the, you know, we like to play quirky music games and Japanese RPGs camp, do you think that Sony might win us over in a year?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Because I truly believe it right now that Sony may be able to schniggle a price drop and some great games in a year that, you know, don't count PS3 out.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I'm trying to be as open-minded as possible about this.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I definitely wouldn't count Sony out. It's just the price that's killing them. I think if they release a Final Fantasy and a Kingdom Hearts, yeah, absolutely, those are going to sell PS3s.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I know tons of people who if Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, they will drop what they're doing and go buy a PS3.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Chris? Chris is nodding her head. That's me. That's me.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Alright, DM, we got to let you go because we got to get to our next round of DDR sneak peeks, but thanks so much for calling in. We appreciate it.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Oh, one more thing. One more thing. While we're talking about the Wii, you all need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio on November the 19th because I will be in studio with a Wii to give to somebody.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And the other thing, I've got, well, since he couldn't share some info about the Wii, I figured I could.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Why? What do you know that he doesn't, or that he can't share?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I have some release dates.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Oh, insider release dates. This should be interesting. That's awesome. That's a great surprise. So you're going to be here in studio with us November 19th. That's something Loki Dark Soccer didn't even know.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I did too. He mentioned it before.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I mentioned there was going to be middle.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Well, so much for surprise, but you're going to be here and giving that away live on air. That should be awesome.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Yeah, I look forward to it.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Thanks so much. You're a true fan, DM. We love you.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Alright, take care guys.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Bye.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
What do you know on release dates?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Well, as we know, there's only really two Nintendo first-party titles that are launching with the Wii in the United States, including Excite Truck and, of course, Zelda Twilight Princess.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:22.000
However, shortly afterwards, we will be getting the next in first-party games, which will be WarriorWare Smooth Moves, which is coming to us on January 16th, 2007.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:33.000
The other thing, which is very interesting, as I mentioned before, Sonic the Secret of the Rings, of course, not a launch title, also confirmed by the launch games that were coming out.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
It is in the launch window, I guess, but it's coming out March 7th, 2007.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So lots of big stuff coming from Sega in March, and I'll get to that a little bit later.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And, of course, Super Paper Mario delayed on the GameCube until the 15th of December, possibly on the Wii in the United States. I don't know.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Kind of foggy on that.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Interesting. Alright.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Well, I think that about covers all the Wii news we wanted to do tonight, so now I want to go around to everybody, our guests included, and I want to ask you guys, what do you think now, after all this news?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Are you sold on the Wii? Were you disappointed with the news you heard this week, or are you happy with the news you heard this week?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Is Nintendo going to win the next round of the console wars? What do you think? We'll start it off with Drew. Drew Nami, what do you think?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Well, personally, I've been sold on the Wii since the E3 announcements, but I know there's a lot of anti-Nintendo people out there, but despite all that, I think Nintendo's got the routine down pat.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Do one thing, do it really well, do it with innovation. I think they're definitely going to score second, if not first, in the console wars for this generation.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Loki. The only disappointment I have is that it's not coming out sooner. The price is fine, because I figured that's about the price I was going to pay for it anyways, and I know I've got to buy lots of accessories for it, because I take this thing to work, I play with my friends, and I've got to have enough controllers for everybody, because they're broke asses.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:13.000
So, that's fine. The only thing I'm just worried about is that I want to make sure I get one on launch. That's my only concern right now, and I'm trying to cover my bases with that.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I do like what they've got coming out as far as games and stuff. I think we're going to see a lot of really cool, innovative things with it. I'm very interested to see these Wii channels. I don't really give a crap about the news too much, but some of the stuff is pretty cool, like the photo channel is pretty neat.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Some quick chat comments, then we'll get Chris's feedback. Knights in our chat says, the two weeks when Gears of War, the PS3, and the Wii come out, I will feel sorry for everyone at GameStop and EB Games.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Anoush in our chat says, I think Sony is going to make it again, but I have no problem with Nintendo, I'll buy a Wii 2, but Sony comes before Microsoft for me. Chris, what are your thoughts?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I don't really get sold on games or the systems that they come with too easily. It's now in school, but I don't know if I'm going to get one at launch, just because I'm really picky about the games that I do have.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Just getting the PS2, which is the only one I've got so far, and some Game Boys, but even that, that took Kingdom Hearts to go get. It's got to be a good game for me to go get it, so I probably won't get it at launch, but it sounds really good, and I'm sure you're going to hear me talk about it constantly, so I'll get enough news from it.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Here's the thing, my big thing about the Wii. The vibe I get from the Wii is the same vibe I get from thinking about playing Castle Crashers, or old arcade games like the 4-player coin-op games. That kind of vibe, where it's fun, you have your friends over, you put some chips on the table or something, you all play a fun game together. That's the kind of vibe I get from it.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Quick chat comment, then we'll get my thoughts, and then Dark Sakura. Bob Coffee says in our chat, I think Nintendo's got it. Sony's just making too many mistakes. The real battle will be here in North America.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:33.000
My thoughts, you know, not since the original 8-bit Nintendo has a word penetrated the general population of America to mean video games, such as Xerox means copies, Kleenex means tissue. I do believe what Nintendo is going for with this is that they are going to make Wii the new word for video gaming.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And I think they definitely have the potential to do that. I think they've got enough with this system set up so that, you know, it's going to appeal to everyone. I mean, you can just pick this thing up and go.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I do know people that are turned off by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 because it's just, you know, too many buttons, too damn many buttons, too much to do. And I think this is going to be the one that sells it to the families.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I think for the hardcore of hardcore gamers, there's another battle that's going to be fought there between 360 and PS3. But I think this is what Nintendo wants. Nintendo is trying to go after the casual gamer, and I think they're going to get it.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And I think the Wii, if not going to be number one, is going to be damn close. And I don't think they're going to sit in third place anymore.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But again, and I might be stealing a little bit of Jamie's thunder here, I'm sorry, but I love this quote. I have to say it. A system is only as good as the games that are on it, and if Wii doesn't continue to impress with good, solid games, I don't want to see no lull like we did on the DS.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And it looks like they're trying to avoid that because they have games planned out through March of 2007 that are all pretty solid titles.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
But as long as we consistently are getting new games that keep our interest, I think Wii's got the potential to do amazingly.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Dark Soccer, your thoughts?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:55.000
First of all, just to go back to what you were saying about Xerox, I remember there being an ad back in the 80s where Xerox would say this is not a generic, please don't use this as a generic.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Nintendo is on its way to having their entire corporate name being used as a generic term for games, and in terms of business, that hurts them.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
So I disagree with that, just after what I've studied in business law.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:27.000
But I do agree, though, that they have been the big innovators. I wanted a Wii when it was a revolution. There's never been a doubt that if Nintendo puts out a system, I am going to own it.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Nintendo could put out a cardboard box and call it the Pooh, and I would buy it.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Jamie, you're gullible. Have I ever told you that?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I am not. If it's Nintendo, it's going to be good. They've always put out quality products.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Pooh is not good.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
It was an example. I didn't mean to buy Pooh.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
All right. Well, those are our opinions. Take them or leave them.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
We'd love to hear your opinions as well, not only in our chat room, but at our email bag, mailbag at orangelandrado.com.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And we'll be getting to some of those emails in Part B.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
But for right now, we're going to shift gears here completely.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We've been running a promotion here on Orange Lounge Radio called the DDR Sneak Peaks.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
We're going to take a first look at new tracks that are going to be in DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Tonight we have a special version of the DDR Sneak Peaks, and tonight we're going to be checking out some of the new power courses.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Well, at least we're going to check out one. We can only really play one of them in full for you guys because they're kind of long.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
But we're going to check out a power course, and it's from the game DDR UltraMix 4 that's going to be out for the Xbox a little later this year.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
It is songs that are mixed together, and they will have steps that go with it.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
This is very reminiscent of, for those of you guys that played DDR Solo, any of those games.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
You remember how they had songs that were mixed together and had a custom step set that went with it?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Well, that's what these are. They're bringing that back in these new games, UltraMix 4 and Universe.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And tonight, we're going to debut one of these power courses for you right now.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:20.000
This one is from DDR UltraMix 4. It is Power Course number 2. It's the Stargaze Mix by DJ Nagi. Enjoy.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I lost a fragment of myself, made me understand what I'd become.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Falling like I always did, made me take control.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Found the weakness, losing touch, leaving me to find what I had lost.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
My heartbeat rather found its place.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Understand me now, listen to the words I'm saying, baby.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I found the ghost, and it keeps me hanging on.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:54.000
