[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday, September 17th, 2006 for episode 200.

4
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:43,853
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't join us live, there's always a podcast.

5
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:44,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what we'll be talking about.

6
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:45,554
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

7
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:50,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be talking about the Wii because the official announcement is going to be happening, what, this Thursday?

8
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:52,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet Nintendo planned it that way.

9
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:53,837
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew.

10
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:55,918
[SPEAKER_03]: They did it just for us.

11
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:04,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Reggie to come out on stage with his 40 and go, this one's for OLR!

12
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,211
[SPEAKER_03]: My bitches!

13
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:08,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I am nobody's bitch.

14
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:14,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I will, however, whore myself out for... Yeah, but who needs a Nintendo press conference to have Wii News?

15
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:16,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, you don't need Wii News.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do what some sites did and tell people, hey, guess what, we got big freaking news coming!

17
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:28,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 12.01 in the morning and then you find out, guess what?

18
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:32,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that we pretty much already knew, that the Wii chips were well under production.

19
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:39,281
[SPEAKER_02]: But IBM came out and confirmed that, that it's been in production since the beginning of this quarter.

20
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:44,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you who are not savvy in the calendar, that means July.

21
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:53,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that the actual first shipments of the chips are in Nintendo's hands, and that the Wii is well underway for launch.

22
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:57,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever that is, of course, we'll know that in a few days.

23
00:01:57,953 --> 00:01:58,694
[SPEAKER_02]: November, though, right?

24
00:01:58,954 --> 00:01:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that for sure.

25
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:08,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's November, but you know, I'm still not whole... You never know, they could just come and say, You've been punked!

26
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:11,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking... It's coming out tomorrow!

27
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,826
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as we're not juiced, I'm okay with that.

28
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So, alright.

29
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:18,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

30
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and to the site's credit, you know...

31
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:27,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the hype machine got way out of control, but they didn't know that people were going to run in on Dig and all this crazy stuff.

32
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people went wild with this.

33
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,504
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be news soon, you know.

34
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck, we already told you guys, the Wii is coming out soon.

35
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:36,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

36
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:41,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, definitely one thing that will be coming to the Wii that is a little bit of a surprise.

37
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:53,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Not usually the type of game you think about when you think about Nintendo, at least I don't, but Splinter Cell Double Agent does appear that it's going to be a launch title, at least that's what IGN reported earlier this week.

38
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:02,868
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii version, Splinter Cell Double Agent, was based on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube builds, and it will fully utilize the unique control system that the Wii has.

39
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:09,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, nothing specific has been given on the control system yet, but I'm sure we will know more as time moves on.

40
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:17,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Examples that have been given as possible ideas that the Wiimote could be used to pick locks and cute little things like that.

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,431
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be fun for those of you guys that are into the Splinter Cell series.

42
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:28,392
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do have a Wii and you just don't want that new finicky controls and stuff from the Wii version, you can just get the GameCube version.

43
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:29,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.

44
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:31,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of...

45
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:42,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I have an announcement to make.

46
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:45,440
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

47
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:50,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I am really fond of burritos.

48
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You're burrito-sexual, huh?

49
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:54,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm burrito-sexual.

50
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:54,908
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hot.

51
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

52
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,072
[SPEAKER_09]: No, really, I, uh, no.

53
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:00,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe one day.

54
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:03,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, release dates.

55
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:03,637
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?

56
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:11,601
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 11th in the UK, we have LEGO Star Wars 2, the opening, the original trilogy, coming up for everything.

57
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:13,903

58
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,883
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming up for everything.

59
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:15,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for PC.

60
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:16,684
[SPEAKER_09]: No, even PC.

61
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:18,225
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming up for everything.

62
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, that's it.

63
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm serious.

64
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:25,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at that and it's all...

65
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you're a Star Wars fan.

66
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:29,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm kidding.

67

72
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to share this real quick from chat.

73
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:19,833
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, the Wii rumors are like the US terror threat.

74
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,594
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know when it will happen, but it will happen soon.

75
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:25,243
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good analogy.

00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:23,584

119
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:29,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Kingdom Hearts 2 is eventually coming out in the U.K.,

120

[SPEAKER_09]: Wee!

121
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,078
[SPEAKER_09]: No, dear, the wee is not out yet.

122
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,380
[SPEAKER_09]: That suddenly made me think of Mitch Hedberg.

123
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,120
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, wee!

124
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:42,682
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're having fun, you mention yourself and other people!

125
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:43,582
Wee!

126
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:48,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Kingdom Hearts 2 is on its way to Europe very soon.

127
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:50,886
[SPEAKER_09]: You will like it!

128
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:51,986
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cute!

129
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:53,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is!

130
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Axel!

131
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:54,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Axel!

132
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've got it memorized by now.

133
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:00,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha.

134
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,758
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't get that yet unless they imported it.

135
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,719
[SPEAKER_15]: They will, believe me, they will.

136
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, back to the news before I'm so rudely interrupted by Mr. Junami in the corner.

137
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:11,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Go eat a donut.

138
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:17,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, but there's a difference between your helping and Junami helping.

139
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,811
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because I always forgive you because you're cute.

140
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:22,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, she just watched the movie.

141
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:22,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not?

142
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the news, hello.

143
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:26,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, okay.

144
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:27,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're a boy.

145
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:28,019
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't count.

146
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:28,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

147
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:36,244
[SPEAKER_09]: To our friends in the UK, it will actually be coming out on September 29th.

148
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:43,048
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out last December in Japan, and we got it this year a few months ago.

149
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,870
[SPEAKER_09]: But honestly, get the game.

150
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,271
[SPEAKER_09]: When it is out, get it.

151
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:49,872
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fantastic.

152
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:52,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of great gameplay.

153
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:55,696
[SPEAKER_09]: But make sure that you do Agrabah and the Pride Lands.

154
00:09:56,366 --> 00:10:02,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure that you do them, because Jamie decided she was going to skip those two places, and now can't get back to them.

155
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,270
A.K.A.

156
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,291
[SPEAKER_09]: you fucked yourself.

157
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:08,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I did, so I have to start over from Dan's game, because he's right where I am, only he did those two parts.

158
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:09,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Winner.

159
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:12,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Who the hell skips areas?

160
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that I was going the right way.

161
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:17,298
[SPEAKER_09]: It gave me a choice.

162
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I chose the one I wanted to do pirates, and I wanted to do... You chose wrong.

163
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I wanted to do pirates in Halloween Town, so you shut up, sir.

164
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Barbossa Barbossa

165
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:53,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that came from when we were riding Pirates of the Caribbean the second time through when we were singing with the whole ride, annoying the people in front of us.

166
00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:00,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Barbossa's up on the Wicked Wench, so we decided to call him Dreamboat Barbie.

167
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

168
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, guys, get the game.

169
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:09,733
[SPEAKER_09]: September 29th, you will not be disappointed.

170
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:12,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

171
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:13,654
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rob...

172
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:28,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, and as far as also other stuff... Okay, these people are giggling and driving me nuts.

173
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:30,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice City Stories...

174
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:36,664
[SPEAKER_09]: and Grand Theft Auto by City Stories will not be going out until November in the UK.

175
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:42,828
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to be out October 20th and now it's been pushed back to November 3rd.

176
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:46,431
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also another good game if you're into the GTA series.

177
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,172
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually is a really good addition to PSP.

178
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:50,333
[SPEAKER_09]: My man's been pretty happy with it.

179
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:54,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also delayed in the United States too, November 1st.

180
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,497
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was referring to Liberty City Stories.

181
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:57,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

182
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:57,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

183
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, was the story about Liberty City?

184
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:01,119
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

185
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:01,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

186
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it's anything like Liberty City... You were about to say Liberty Shitty, I think you were.

187
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:09,145
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

188
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:09,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

189
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:11,026
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my game, bitch!

190
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:16,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying if it was anything like Liberty City Stories, because Dan was playing that game all the time, keeping me awake.

191
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:17,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear...

192
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big fan of Grand Theft Auto.

193
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:35,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand why it's so freaking amazingly popular, but I think I might actually get suckered into playing Saints Row, because as we've all found out, I easily succumb to peer pressure, hence why I'm playing Final Fantasy XI again.

194
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:37,434
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll probably go to Saints Row, too.

195
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:40,556
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun, casual game, where you casually beat up workers.

196
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:41,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I like casual.

197
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,078
I like beating up workers.

198
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:44,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so...

199
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, delayed in the United States until November 1st.

200
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks because I was really looking forward to play that in October.

201
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just play some more Liberty City stories.

202
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:55,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of delays, Forza 2.

203
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been rumored to be delayed to 2007.

204
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:01,799
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming straight from the development team.

205
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:08,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Their quote is, I think we've always said that it will appear in our...

206
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:10,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Day of Forza

207
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:33,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rumored, let me put it this way, it's not coming out when it was supposed to.

208
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:41,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is straight, you know, I actually, when I saw this story, I, you know, called my Microsoft rep and asked him when the fuck this game's coming out.

209
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's to be announced right now.

210
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:48,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in November, I think the 15th, and now it's being pushed back even further.

211
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're supposed to know the official date in a couple weeks, so that should be interesting.

212
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:54,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

213
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the other game I was going to mention?

214
00:13:55,977 --> 00:14:04,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Crackdown was another game that was slated for the end of, or actually middle of October, and that's been delayed to be announced now.

215
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:07,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the only Microsoft game coming out in October, Fusion Frenzy 2.

216
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:27,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of delays on the Xbox, if you were the one person that was looking forward to Scramble coming onto Xbox Live Arcade this week, sorry, but you have to wait one more week because there were some last-minute things that had to be cleaned up with Scramble, and it's now going to be released this week.

217
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:30,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably by the time you hear this podcast, it's already on the marketplace.

218
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,763
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you folks listening live, it'll be out this Wednesday.

219
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:39,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Microsoft has this big Xbox Live Arcade promotion thing going on where they're trying to release new stuff every Wednesday.

220
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had to put something out this Wednesday.

221
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:43,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did we get instead of Scramble?

222
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:53,628
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a brand new Uno deck featuring cards from Project Gotham Racing 3 for 100 points.

223
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet less people will be buying this than Scramble.

224
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

225
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there's a lot of Uno horse out there.

226
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are pretty hardcore.

227
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:04,611
[SPEAKER_03]: They're Unos.

228
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

229
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big Scramble fan.

230
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:07,952
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't

231
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:08,898
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

232
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of things coming out for the 360, Japan is actually getting lucky.

233
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:32,762
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember when the console launched over Japan, they didn't get a core unit.

234
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:35,305
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically just had the premium unit and that was it.

235
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:41,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now the 360 core is making its way over to Japan and they're getting a few additions to it.

236
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:46,017
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.

237
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:46,017
[SPEAKER_02]: The price point is going to be less than what it is in the United States.

238
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:55,083
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only going to be 29,800 yen, which is around about $255, which is about 40 bucks less than what we're paying for it now.

239
00:15:57,065 --> 00:16:06,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, what's kind of neat about it is the core pack will include two games, 99 Nights and Project Gotham Racing 3 as well.

240
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:07,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

241
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:11,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the hard drives are supposed to be sold around $85 there, too.

242
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:15,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, overall, they're getting a pretty good discount.

243
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we'd get some bundles over here, but that's not going to be the case.

244
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:18,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

245
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:21,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that's going to be available November 2nd.

246
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:22,886
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

247
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:23,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

248
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:26,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of...

249
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:28,776
[SPEAKER_09]: and so on.

250
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,971
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be in euros.

251
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:56,672
[SPEAKER_09]: That's 293 euros, by the way.

252
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:59,934
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will come with two HD DVD movies.

253
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:10,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there's a rumor that the premium console bundle with the movie player will be coming out around 400 pounds.

254
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,139
[SPEAKER_09]: and the speculations could even be as low as $3.75.

255
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we hearing more about this in Europe than we are in the U.S.?

256
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:22,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the news has been very quiet on the HD DVD expansion here in the U.S.

257
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Microsoft waiting for something?

258
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:26,287
[SPEAKER_03]: X06?

259
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:26,847
[SPEAKER_03]: When is that?

260
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:27,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

261
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:32,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this we speculated last week with the whole, you know, Halo 3 is coming out earlier in the year.

262
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it seem like Microsoft's going to be holding a press conference soon where they start announcing a lot of this stuff?

263
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:36,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

264
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

265
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:41,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the other rumor, which we'll get into later, was another racing game.

266
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:42,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

267
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:50,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft isn't really commenting on it as much yet and I guess it's for the same reason that we're not seeing much on it over here.

268
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:57,224
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's really looking like they're actually trying to now really take advantage of the UK market is what it seems like.

269
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point this out in chat.

270
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,348
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat is on this big kick right now.

271
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:06,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I never understand when the chat room gets on this thing and they

272
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,503
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

273
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that makes sense.

274
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,374
[SPEAKER_03]: This just in.

275
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:37,776
[SPEAKER_03]: When people buy the Oblivion Horse Armor, they will buy the PGR deck in Uno.

276
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:38,777
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

277
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to buy it.

278
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:40,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody will buy it.

279
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:42,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But not me.

280
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:42,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

281
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:48,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Uno's cool and all, but I don't need 100 points for new cards that are basically a commercial for another Microsoft game.

282
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:50,483
[SPEAKER_02]: They need an Uno deck that's the Horse Armor.

283
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:54,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's showing off the Horse Armor to get people to buy the Horse Armor.

284
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,626
[SPEAKER_03]: You were right, by the way, Jamie.

285
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Nazgul Slayer.

286
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:58,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

287
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:58,708
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

288
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff that Japan is also going to be seeing a price drop in.

289
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:04,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the PlayStation 2.

290
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:12,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually pretty interesting because I don't think any... Well, everybody else has been dropping the price of the PS2.

291
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:17,888
[SPEAKER_02]: But the PS2 is going to be dropping to 19,980 yen, which is about $170.

292
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:22,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So not too big of a drop, but still an okay drop.

293
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:27,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I remember correctly, the... What was that...

294
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:30,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

295
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:34,347
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the old price.

296
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an idiot.

297
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay, people make mistakes.

298
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:38,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

299
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I should do my research.

300
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:42,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not allowed to make mistakes!

301
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:45,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know, the dozens and dozens of people that listen to this show are going to be very upset at you.

302
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:46,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

303
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:50,079
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay, you can just give them the raspberry.

304
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the new suggested retail price for the PS2 in the...

305
00:19:56,351 --> 00:20:00,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that might be their way of stealing the Wii announcement thunder, but whatever.

306
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:02,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's going to be happening soon.

307
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:07,293
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you know, you might be one of those people in Japan that hasn't bought a PlayStation 2 yet, which is ridiculous.

308
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,277
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what is the website of the week?

309
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:52,850
[SPEAKER_09]: The website of the week is Gamer.org.

310
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,032
[SPEAKER_09]: G-A-Y-M-E-R.org.

311
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:59,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I... Stop doing that face!

312
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:03,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking to Junami, being a dork, as usual.

313
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:06,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's actually, it was really cool.

314
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran across this, um, just looking randomly.

315
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:10,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

316
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:15,775
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a site basically for gay and gay-friendly gaming, pretty much.

317
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:22,740
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, to go ahead and read a little blurb off of the website, it says, you know, why do you need a gay gamer site?

318
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:28,945
[SPEAKER_09]: The truth is, in the gaming community, there are some pretty staunchly homophobic players, and Gamer.org is about having... Yeah, Drew Nami.

319
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:29,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

320
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:31,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Who makes faces.

321
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,989
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about having fun without hearing the bashing.

322
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, you know, I like what it says here, so I give this site to you as a safe haven where gaming is the focus, not hate.

323
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:48,761
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually a World of Warcraft guild on here that's on the Blackwing server, their alliance, called Alternatives with an alter-native.

324
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.

325
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:51,684
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've looked at the site.

326
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:56,568
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got some core views, gaming news.

327
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,891
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty well put together site.

328
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:05,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say not overly a lot to look at, but the information is great.

329
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:08,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I love just reading over the community there.

330
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:16,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I only have one complaint about this site, and that's when you go over the drop-down menus, I don't like the little tinkle noise.

331
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:18,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else to call it.

332
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:23,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairy dust spreading all over your computer as you visit the site.

333
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:27,130
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this high-pitched little noise, and I'm like, are you ganging my computer?

334
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, I don't need... I'm in your computer.

335
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,496
[SPEAKER_03]: and your computer gating you up.

336
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:35,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to give a shout out to a couple other, although that is a good site, I have visited that site.

337
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to give a shout out to a couple other gay friendly gaming sites because, you know, a couple years ago there weren't any.

338
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:44,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really nice to see these, you know, gay gamer sites that are awesome.

339
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:48,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them I've been visiting a lot recently because they have a hilarious blog.

340
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

341
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gaygamer.net and they have a hilarious blog there.

342
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:56,536
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been photoshopping Nintendudes is their latest thing going on and they have like

343
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's Twink Edition, and things like that.

344
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's silly, but it's funny.

345
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,600
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's funny.

346
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:03,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got some forums there, too.

347
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:06,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also have to mention Gamer Experimentations is another forum I've posted on before.

348
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:09,085
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a semi-active community over there.

349
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:13,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that whole World of Warcraft guild thing was going down a couple months ago,

350
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:16,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very active discussion going on over there.

351
00:23:16,357 --> 00:23:17,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very cool.

352
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of gay and World of Warcraft, some of the sound clips have come out for the, they've leaked to the internet somehow from the beta or I don't know what.

353
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:32,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the sound clips of some of the new races, including Blood Elves and Draanes.

354
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:41,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now, I'm not saying that the Blood Elves are gay, but here's a clip of what one of the things the Blood Elves says, and you be the judge.

355
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:45,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

356
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god!

357
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:49,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob?

358
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:50,253
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't know.

359
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:54,596
[SPEAKER_15]: You must now take back that homophobic joke, because I am making one of those.

360
00:23:55,196 --> 00:23:55,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright?

361
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:57,077
[SPEAKER_15]: That was awesome.

362
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,722
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's some great sound clips as well, and that's just to the iceberg.

363
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But then get this.

364
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: The female blood elf seems to be a little bit of a valley girl.

365
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

366
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell me on this one.

367
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to Undercity to get a facial.

368
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:13,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you seen these people?

369
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:18,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, you don't have a lower jaw and you're going to give me a facial?

370
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:19,739
[SPEAKER_11]: She got mad.

371
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,380
[SPEAKER_11]: At least I think she did.

372
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:23,782
[SPEAKER_11]: You ever heard someone talk without a lower jaw?

373
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:28,907
[SPEAKER_11]: She sounded like a murloc.

374
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:31,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Or getting her hair done.

375
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:37,648
[SPEAKER_15]: at a troll shop and winding up with a mohawk and a frickin' bone in her nose.

376
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:38,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Getting her hair did.

377
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:38,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Killed it.

378
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:39,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Killed it.

379
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Killed it.

380
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:46,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Although the female Draenei voices are also funny, asking if gnomes come with vibrate functions.

381
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I haven't gotten there yet.

382
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten there yet.

383
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:50,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, play it.

384
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Stinkin' jerk.

385
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the Draenei female.

386
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:55,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?

387
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not call that.

388
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:58,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shut up.

389
00:24:58,191 --> 00:24:59,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't hear that over your bitching.

390
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?

391
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:03,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious.

392
00:25:04,164 --> 00:25:05,425
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not mean to call that.

393
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:33,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this planet.

394
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I come here, I see cow and chicken and ride little horses.

395
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:36,257
[SPEAKER_03]: This planet has everything.

396
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:36,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's balky.

397
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:36,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.

398
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:37,958
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that show?

399
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:39,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on Perfect Strangers.

400
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:05,868
[SPEAKER_07]: In old country, boobs did not fly free.

401
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:08,069
[SPEAKER_07]: They were disciplined, structured.

402
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:10,289
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we have Uta's brassieres.

403
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:12,030
[SPEAKER_07]: They hold boobies in place.

404
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,490
[SPEAKER_15]: In Soviet Russia now.

405
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,791
[SPEAKER_15]: In the world of Warcraft, Dronne drink you.

406
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:20,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

407
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:22,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Silly.

408
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:25,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Cultural influence confusion.

409
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:31,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Male Draenei, their dance animation is the internet phenomenon Tunak Tunak Tunak dance.

410
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:32,759
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

411
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,223
[SPEAKER_15]: And Blood Elf Males do have the Napoleon Dynamite dance going for them.

412
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:38,343
Ew.

413
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:39,384
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

414
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:41,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to add to their sexual ambiguity.

415
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:45,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though Napoleon Dynamite is kind of last year's news, that's kind of awesome.

416
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:46,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate Napoleon Dynamite.

417
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,790
[SPEAKER_03]: You hate Napoleon Dynamite?

418
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like the one person in the world that thought that movie was the best thing in the world.

419
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:51,493
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually I know a lot.

420
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:51,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's anti-human.

421
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:55,856
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that the movie got so hyped up, by the time a lot of people saw it, they were like, that's it?

422
00:26:56,377 --> 00:27:01,160
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's only one thing in the world that needs to live up to the hype, and that's Snakes on a Plane.

423
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:02,739
[SPEAKER_15]: And it did.

424
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Snakes on a Plane was fantastic.

425
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:06,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't seen it.

426
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:09,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord help us all.

427
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, give me my microphone, thank you.

428
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:15,306
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I fucking hated that movie.

429
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:16,467
[SPEAKER_07]: That movie was great.

430
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:18,488
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dumb.

431
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

432
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:26,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of really stupid things... In World of Warcraft, Planes on Snakes!

433
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:29,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me my joke book back!

434
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:30,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

435
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:44,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of really dumb, dumb, dumb speculation, there was a, I guess, a story posted about how some cryptologists have figured out the Wii date.

436
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:46,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's how they did it.

437
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Roman numerals.

438
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:49,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I heard about that.

439
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:50,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Roman numerals.

440
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:55,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you see, a W is actually, looks like two Vs, which would equal 10.

441
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two I's would be two.

442
00:27:58,661 --> 00:28:00,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, October 2nd.

443
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, they are stupid is my opinion on the whole thing.

444
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:14,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, with all due respect to the sites that ran this story, why is this news?

445
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:17,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this news?

446
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:19,518
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not news.

447
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:29,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Me coming over there to strangle you for running stories like this that perpetuate these stinking rumors, that would be news.

448
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:34,882
[SPEAKER_03]: That is great video game journalism when I come strangle you for writing these stories around the internet.

449
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

450
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:38,788
[SPEAKER_08]: That just broke my ear.

451
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:39,718
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're welcome.

452
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you back for earlier.

453
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I guess that was Jamie who did it earlier.

454
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,540
[SPEAKER_09]: That was me.

455
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Traitor!

456
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:45,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Traitor!

457
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:50,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say this, because in the chat room here, I'm not sure if this is Cage or Kage.

458
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:51,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably Kage.

459
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:51,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Kage.

460
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:56,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Snakes, or, I'm sorry, whoops, that's not what I was, that's not the comment I wanted to read.

461
00:28:56,686 --> 00:29:01,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Kage said this, World of Warcraft is YTMND with a level cap.

462
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:04,289
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a good way to sum it up.

463
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that comment.

464
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:10,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

465
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:12,559
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about what made the movie irated.

466
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

467
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:14,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

468
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:14,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

469
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:15,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

470
00:29:15,341 --> 00:29:15,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

471
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:16,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

472
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Traitor.

473
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,204
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it my turn now?

474
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:23,665
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to report this on your blogs?

475
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a worldwide exclusive.

476
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:28,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky leaves Orange Lounge Radio right before episode 200.

477
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

478
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And no one cares.

479
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:32,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no one cares.

480
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:32,849
[SPEAKER_03]: No one will run it.

481
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And we replace them with a flask of coffee.

482
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,772
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand, no one...

483
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:42,415
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to believe that you left the show until IGN reports it anyways.

484
00:29:44,557 --> 00:29:47,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, next week I'm going to be... That person has to circulate a one-up.

485
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:52,503
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the big news for next week's show, is that I'm replaced with a blood elf male, actually.

486
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

487
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:02,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway... Okay.

488
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the news.

489
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:06,193
[SPEAKER_09]: My God, you people are random.

490
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I blame Drew Nami's presence.

491
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:12,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, as he bowels, bowels?

492
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:17,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I just cleaned the carpet, Drew!

493
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:19,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't you paper trained?

494
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:20,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

495
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:21,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

496
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:31,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Our dear friends at Squeenix are being sued by Softworld International for 3.78 million dollars.

497
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:34,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently...

498
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,174
[SPEAKER_09]: D.M.N.

499
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:37,635
[SPEAKER_09]: has a new nickname for Drew.

500
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:37,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Poonami

501
00:31:07,093 --> 00:31:07,733
[SPEAKER_03]: How old are we?

502
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:11,115
[SPEAKER_07]: He said poo.

503
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Does this mean I have to team up with Poo Eater?

504
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Drew, are these... Then we won't have to worry about a mess.

505
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:17,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Poo Maker and Poo Eater.

506
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:19,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these poo jokes making you angry?

507
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Very angry.

508
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you know what time it is.

509
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:25,222
Sigh.

510
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:37,391
[SPEAKER_03]: FUs of the week time.

511
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:44,333
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes towards the really... No, no, no, no, no, it wasn't that.

512
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:49,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually do not quite recall what it was I was so angry about because I was really freaking angry.

513
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:51,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it when you called me from downtown earlier?

514
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:55,697
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it... Well, okay, this is my... And I hate to resort to traffic.

515
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:56,357
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what it was.

516
00:31:57,218 --> 00:32:00,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking person who almost ran into me while I was on the 80.

517
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you on your car?

518
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to go back to you.

519
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:12,018
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was some dumbass was swerving to avoid another dumbass and nearly ran into me and I swerved.

520
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:19,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I managed to stay in my lane, but like five people behind me had to pull into the side because they were all swerving.

521
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:25,722
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all the traffic on the Bay Bridge, since they did all the work on it.

522
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:28,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they done with the work, though?

523
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,901
[SPEAKER_09]: They're supposed to be, but it was still stupid.

524
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally dislike you now.

525
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:45,091
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm also lying.

526
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

527
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:47,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

528
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:52,535
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to all those

529
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:55,188
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

530
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:29,479
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to the amazing off-topicness of tonight's show.

531
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,100
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

532
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're going to have a lot of new listeners tonight thanks to the DDR stuff.

533
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:41,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would also say FU to just how crazy my work has been.

534
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:44,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week is going to suck and it makes me want to cry.

535
00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:47,636
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a job.

536
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:48,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Pays the rent.

537
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:49,337
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

538
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:51,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, do you have any FUs?

539
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:58,059
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU goes to whoever invented the United States.

540
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:07,362
[SPEAKER_08]: He sucks and needs to get resurrected and die again because, as most of you know, my girlfriend lives in Wisconsin.

541
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:08,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I live in Northern California.

542
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:10,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't walk there.

543
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:12,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me sad.

544
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:13,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss her a lot.

545
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:15,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me sad that she's not here.

546
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:17,466
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to the pedestrians?

547
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck pedestrians!

548
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:20,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck America!

549
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I want her right here!

550
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I have this.

551
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:33,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was going to be a political rant, and then it was just a F you to the distance, my heart aches, gush, gush, gush, cute.

552
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,211
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have heard me trying to get rid of her on the phone.

553
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:42,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, not get rid of her, but when I was talking to her on the phone during the break, I was going, I miss you, I love you.

554
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,534
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I miss you too.

555
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:46,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I gotta go, I miss you.

556
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:47,235
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not that sad.

557
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:48,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I just threw up in my mouth.

558
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:49,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, I'm a girl.

559
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,217
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Drew, any F yous?

560
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:52,958
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, F you to...

561
00:34:53,865 --> 00:35:02,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I have friends of mine who call in on their 21st and ask me to roll a DC-15 check against their fortitude to see if they're drunk.

562
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:04,047
[SPEAKER_15]: I shit you not.

563
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:08,949
[SPEAKER_15]: He had me roll to see if he was drunk on 4 Rubber Coats.

564
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:11,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

565
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:12,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you are!

566
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any girls there?

567
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

568
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,991
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any girls there, I wanna do them!

569
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:22,089
[SPEAKER_16]: God, kill me now.

570
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,550
[SPEAKER_15]: And there were, and I did, but I wasn't there.

571
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing Ogres.

572
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that it?

573
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:32,692
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not there, you're getting drunk!

574
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:37,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, a big F you to Guild Drama on my server.

575
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:38,894
[SPEAKER_15]: It really sucks ass.

576
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:40,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Silverwing wanted to know if he failed, by the way.

577
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:43,395
[SPEAKER_15]: He did fail his check.

578
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:44,576
[SPEAKER_15]: His DC 15, he rolled an 8.

579
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:51,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

580
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:54,703
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, shows like this drive me to drink.

581
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:58,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Games like this might drive me to drink, too.

582
00:35:58,607 --> 00:35:59,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

583
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:00,288
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it might be okay.

584
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:03,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game coming out from Ubisoft, and it's called Alive.

585
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:06,594
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposedly going to be coming out in 2007.

586
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:08,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It was first talked about in March 2006.

587
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:14,261
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes this interesting is that this game has been referred to as an Action Plus title.

588
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a genre that...

589
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:28,851
[SPEAKER_03]: The International Herald Tribune writer Doreen Carvajal has spun into Ubisoft's attempt to focus on what the writer says is the feminine side of gaming.

590
00:36:29,952 --> 00:36:35,837
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, the reason is because Alive is more oriented toward drama, more life in characters, more depth.

591
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:40,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about surviving, but you can't resolve things by shooting only.

592
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:46,147
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, Alive features characters who rely on their instincts and each other to endure after an earthquake.

593
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:49,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, boring!

594
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently girls like boring games.

595
00:36:52,072 --> 00:36:52,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew?

596
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:53,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck that noise!

597
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:55,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

598
00:36:57,227 --> 00:36:58,008
[SPEAKER_08]: That was not nice.

599
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:00,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I like killing things as much as a nice person.

600
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:05,253
[SPEAKER_03]: In all seriousness, if Ubisoft wants to make the ultimate girl game, what should they be making?

601
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,257
[SPEAKER_09]: A Lorena Bob at the MMO.

602
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Next topic!

603
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,444
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to make fucking Barbie, like, Horse Adventures 6.

604
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:23,607
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Barbie with a vengeance or something.

605
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:26,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Barbie fucks you up.

606
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:31,676
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was a really good girl game, I thought.

607
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It was for the computer.

608
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:34,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Alice.

609
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:35,879
[SPEAKER_08]: American McGee's Alice.

610
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,440
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a fucking great game.

611
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.

612
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:39,341
Drugs.

613
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:42,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you're a girl smoking crack.

614
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:47,827
[SPEAKER_09]: IGN ripping off OLR said Megzy and Chris is pro-lesbian too.

615
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:49,108
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

616
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:50,009
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that from?

617
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:50,789
[SPEAKER_09]: For a game suggestion.

618
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

619
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hot.

620
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:53,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Anywho.

621
00:37:56,331 --> 00:38:01,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of games for girls, Dead Rising is supposed to be getting some download content here pretty soon.

622
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:07,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they did get some download content, but there's going to be some coming to in-store kiosks as well.

623
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:14,639
[SPEAKER_02]: If you actually check online, they do have on the marketplace a brand new costume, I guess.

624
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold-Hearted Snake is what it's called.

625
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea what that looks like because I haven't actually played it.

626
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Paula Abdul.

627
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:22,362
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a snake outfit.

628
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:25,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like Solid Snake, but it looks like snake skin is your suit.

629
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:26,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a snakeskin suit.

630
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

631
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:29,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

632
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:38,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the in-store kiosks, they're supposed to be getting Accountant, Burgundy Wine, Pure White Suit, and Stripe.

633
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:41,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are going to be available in keys in the brand new September kiosk disc.

634
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:44,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for that pretty soon.

635
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Gotham Racing 4

636
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:39,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's through this contest, or it's through the site that's talking about having a contest for designing the car And the winning design will be on Project Gotham Racing 4 Just like Test Drive Unlimited Well, and actually, neat news Sorry You know, Project Gotham 4, it's going to be in my house And it's going to annoy the crap out of me Just like its predecessors did

637
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:43,070
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is some news.

638
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Who of our listeners reads Vibe Magazine?

639
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:54,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, not usually the best known thing for gaming news.

640
00:39:55,898 --> 00:40:04,563
[SPEAKER_09]: However, they had $150 under a description for the Wii in their last issue.

641
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:08,845
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm looking at the image now.

642
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:19,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It has down at the bottom just a little description about all the stuff that's going to be on it.

643
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:37,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It says $150 www.nintendo.com So we're not sure if that's actually going to be just based off of rumors or if it's going to be more in the close to $300 range like we were hearing before.

644
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a rumor.

645
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:40,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's

646
00:40:41,536 --> 00:40:44,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they've posted unsubstantiated information.

647
00:40:44,697 --> 00:40:48,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was just a placeholder that accidentally went to print that shouldn't have.

648
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:49,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it means anything.

649
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:54,659
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, wasn't there those rumors saying that the Europe site said it was going to be 150 pounds?

650
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,200
[SPEAKER_03]: 150 pounds would be a lot more here.

651
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, but usually if it's $2.99 here, like look at the PlayStation 3, it's going to be $5.99 here, $5.99 pounds over there.

652
00:40:59,261 --> 00:40:59,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, possible.

653
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:00,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually...

654
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:12,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I think converting that would bring it up to at least the $200.

655
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:15,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not possible, but can you imagine if they released that for $99?

656
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:18,187
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be phenomenal.

657
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:20,669
[SPEAKER_09]: It would fly off the shelves.

658
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone would own a Wii.

659
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:24,273
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

660
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:26,054
[SPEAKER_02]: But even $199 is going to be pretty good.

661
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:30,639
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you're going to know in a couple days anyway, so who cares?

662
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:35,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well this is the part of the show where we open it up to you guys to call us and interact with us.

671
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:01,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

672
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, I am number one.

673
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn, I'm good.

674
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:06,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you just had to trigger a finger there.

675
00:42:07,265 --> 00:42:10,289
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma, hey, I hear you're a snitch.

676
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:13,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what can I say?

677
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:15,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone pays my bills.

678
00:42:15,755 --> 00:42:19,879
[SPEAKER_03]: My finger is floating over the hang-up button, so you better have some... Hey, don't hang up on him.

679
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I veto hanging up on him.

680
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,521
[SPEAKER_03]: You better have something good to say.

681
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:29,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have a lot of good stuff to say, because, you know, if you was going to do that, I wasn't going to treat you to Dunkin' Donuts when you came to New York City.

682
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then maybe I won't hang up on you.

683
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:31,968
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

684
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:33,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, a few things.

685
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say hi to everybody in the studio, and a special hello to the angel of death, Loki.

686
00:42:39,835 --> 00:42:40,455
Hi.

687
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:42,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I forgot to mention.

688
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

689
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:46,011
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of funny.

690
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:49,152
[SPEAKER_02]: They had screenshots from Africa get posted this week.

691
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:51,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa.

692
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:53,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we figure out what the game's about yet?

693
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:54,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

694
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just pictures of animals.

695
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:56,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about animal poo.

696
00:42:57,056 --> 00:42:57,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

697
00:42:57,796 --> 00:42:58,316
Africa.

698
00:42:59,557 --> 00:42:59,917
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

699
00:43:00,357 --> 00:43:01,938
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, really, Ranma?

700
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:06,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I play DDR Supernova, and I'm in love.

701
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

702
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,861
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you love about DDR Supernova?

703
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:11,197
[SPEAKER_13]: I just love the eye candy to it.

704
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:16,839
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the new videos, all the new characters dancing, especially Emmy's new costume.

705
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Emmy's new costume.

706
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,761
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say is your favorite song in DDR Supernova?

707
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:28,622
[SPEAKER_13]: I only got to play one song, and right now, I was floored by Centerfold.

708
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:30,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Captain Jack song.

709
00:43:30,963 --> 00:43:31,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

710
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's cool.

711
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:37,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you going to be picking up the home version when it comes out for PS2?

712
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:38,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck yes.

713
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:39,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

714
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:43,136
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I hear you can make your own steps at home and then take them to the arcade.

715
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:43,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be fun.

716
00:43:44,797 --> 00:43:48,299
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be awesome, but... It's like the old days.

717
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but the machines around here don't have memory cards.

718
00:43:52,502 --> 00:43:53,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't.

719
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:53,923
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to get them.

720
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:55,984
[SPEAKER_13]: We're working on it.

721
00:43:56,465 --> 00:43:56,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

722
00:43:57,925 --> 00:43:58,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on your mind, Ranma?

723
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:01,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I beat New Super Mario Bros.

724
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:05,030
[SPEAKER_13]: and Nintendo threw old schoolers a bone in the game.

725
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:05,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what's that?

726
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait until you get to the final level in the castle.

727
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:11,167
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I'm going to say.

728
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:13,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

729
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:14,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright Ranma, we've got to let you go.

730
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:15,970
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get more callers, okay?

731
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Two more things, Ranma, I think.

732
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:26,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, I picked up Beatmania for $40 at Version Megastore and I'm calling out Drunami and Nintendo Maniac 64 for bad phone calls.

733
00:44:26,136 --> 00:44:26,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

734
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:28,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm raising the bar here.

735
00:44:29,097 --> 00:44:30,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, you can do better than me.

736
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:31,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dear.

737
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:32,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Drunami, response?

738
00:44:34,781 --> 00:44:35,181
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on.

739
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:38,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Ranma.

740
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:38,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

741
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:39,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

742
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,774
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to go to another call here on the Skype line.

743
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:45,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to answer it.

744
00:44:46,376 --> 00:44:47,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, okay.

745
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:48,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Africa, Africa.

746
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:49,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Zebra Buzz.

747
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:52,041
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

748
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:53,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you're calling Orange Lounge Radio.

749
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:55,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

750
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:56,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, this is Solar Wing.

751
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:57,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Solar Wing.

752
00:44:57,947 --> 00:44:59,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You've never called the show before, have you?

753
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:03,198
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm a first-time actually live listener.

754
00:45:03,518 --> 00:45:06,000
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're popping someone's Skype cherry tonight.

755
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,741
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

756
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:09,263
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to have some new blood on the show tonight.

757
00:45:09,283 --> 00:45:09,924
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

758
00:45:11,705 --> 00:45:12,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, a few things.

759
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:14,888
[SPEAKER_14]: First, the PS3 thing.

760
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,191
[SPEAKER_14]: How many do you actually think will actually make it to Canada?

761
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:21,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it says 400,000 to North America.

762
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:22,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, good point.

763
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:27,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that necessarily mean anything about it just going to States or Canada or what?

764
00:45:28,522 --> 00:45:33,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a damn good point that I don't know if anyone's really thought of about how many of those machines are going to Canada.

765
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:35,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone assumed North America is just the United States.

766
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:37,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like, you know, Europe doesn't exist.

767
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:39,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mexico, apparently.

768
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mexico is getting 350,000.

769
00:45:42,295 --> 00:45:47,961
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know what's sad, my friend, is that probably Canada is getting about 10,000 of that.

770
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:50,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't say that.

771
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:52,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a Sony fan?

772
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:55,537
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I actually owe someone a PS3.

773
00:45:55,738 --> 00:45:57,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You owe someone a PS3?

774
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:00,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you must have done something big.

775
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,820
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I want to know.

776
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,060
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do?

777
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:08,022
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a Christmas present, wedding present, birthday present from two years.

778
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:11,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, so this is like a get out of presents.

779
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:14,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you having to make up for presents you forgot?

780
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:17,108
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he had a choice.

781
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,629
[SPEAKER_14]: It was either Xbox 360 or PS3.

782
00:46:19,669 --> 00:46:23,830
[SPEAKER_14]: He chose the PS3 because he hates me.

783
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:24,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

784
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:29,893
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is going to be a get-out-of-presence free pass for the next two years, apparently.

785
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:30,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

786
00:46:31,073 --> 00:46:31,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

787
00:46:32,154 --> 00:46:32,974
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty big one.

788
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:40,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Even so, I think that with the shipment coming out, it would be similar to what the other systems are.

789
00:46:40,446 --> 00:46:43,648
[SPEAKER_09]: There shouldn't be any type of region coding or any type of specification between.

790
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:44,468
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, not for Canada.

791
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:50,032
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wouldn't see why you can't order one off of GameStop's site or something like that.

792
00:46:50,212 --> 00:46:57,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you might be able to just order, you know, it might cost a little extra for shipping, but if Push came to shove, you could order one from a U.S.

793
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,118
[SPEAKER_03]: website and just have it shipped to Canada.

794
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:01,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I could probably do that.

795
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:05,309
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just $700 as it is, plus how much are the games?

796
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, true.

797
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:13,273
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking $600 American, which is a little bit more in Canadian, although not much lately.

798
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:15,093
[SPEAKER_03]: The dollars are equating pretty soon here.

799
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:17,454
[SPEAKER_03]: What part of Canada are you from?

800
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,035
[SPEAKER_14]: West Coast, near Toronto.

801
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:21,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Near Toronto?

802
00:47:21,336 --> 00:47:21,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

803
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, Toronto's not... Wait, they consider Toronto the West Coast?

804
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:25,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

805
00:47:25,763 --> 00:47:26,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

806
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:27,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

807
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:31,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can always, you know, dip in... I don't know how far of a drive you are from the U.S.

808
00:47:31,187 --> 00:47:33,168
[SPEAKER_03]: border, but, you know, you can always dip into the U.S.

809
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,710
[SPEAKER_03]: and try some of the big Best Buys, you know, around the border.

810
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:36,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be a thought.

811
00:47:37,171 --> 00:47:37,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you think so?

812
00:47:37,912 --> 00:47:38,452
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of...

813
00:47:40,296 --> 00:47:45,019
[SPEAKER_09]: The distributors, you know, the national distributors are in California.

814
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:54,504
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you order from any of the distribution sites or any of the other, maybe even the importers, you're still probably going to get a system fairly quickly.

815
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:56,765
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as shipping is concerned.

816
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:01,828
[SPEAKER_14]: My other question was about the new NTSs.

817
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what about them?

818
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:04,850
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think about them?

819
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting a pink one.

820
00:48:06,654 --> 00:48:07,274
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

821
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:08,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I like mine.

822
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:11,297
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of dirty because it's been in my purse.

823
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:12,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you have the white one?

824
00:48:12,578 --> 00:48:14,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have the virginal white one.

825
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:18,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think they'll actually fix that crack issue?

826
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:20,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the whole, the cracking of the hinges?

827
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:30,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine because it was such a big deal on the blogs that they'll do something about it, but I don't know, what can you really do about the hinges without redesigning the whole setup of the system?

828
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:31,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I know mine hasn't yet.

829
00:48:31,936 --> 00:48:36,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think they all have, but I hear the fats are cracking now too.

830
00:48:36,658 --> 00:48:39,939
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the blogs I was reading ran a story that their fat was cracking.

831
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:45,701
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, it takes one person with an internet site to have that happen and then, you know, it's all over the internet.

832
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know exactly how rampant the cracks are.

833
00:48:48,822 --> 00:48:53,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that issue is less widespread than people are thinking.

834
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:54,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the black one.

835
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:55,505
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't be able to see the crack.

836
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:56,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

837
00:48:57,066 --> 00:48:57,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there you go.

838
00:48:57,746 --> 00:48:58,146
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

839
00:48:58,806 --> 00:49:01,567
[SPEAKER_14]: My last thing, I've played DDR once.

840
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:02,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

841
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:04,008
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was looking at getting a PS2.

842
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:05,969
[SPEAKER_14]: What should I get for DDR?

843
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Get an ignition pad, first of all.

844
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, make sure you get a good dance pad.

845
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:15,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, well, if he's warming up to DDR, I'd say a $20 dance pad can hold him over to see if he likes the game.

846
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:20,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially because you can play the basic songs on the cheapo pads.

847
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:23,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you get into the harder stuff, though, it will start moving under your feet.

848
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:29,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say by far the best home release for PS2 is Extreme 2, the most recent one, and that'll be the easiest one to find.

849
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:36,998
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could probably get some of the oldies for like $20 American easily, like Max 2 and DDR Extreme.

850
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:40,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not bad, but DDR Extreme 2 is by far the best one.

851
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably right after Supernova comes out, that will drop in price.

852
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:46,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And who knows, maybe actually Supernova's going to be the best one.

853
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:49,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't tell you until after I've played it, but it sounds like it's going to be pretty good.

854
00:49:49,867 --> 00:50:16,732
[SPEAKER_03]: but Extreme 2 has a lot of radio friendly songs and things you might have heard of before and not a bunch of crazy stuff that sometimes turns people off to DDR alright, well thanks not a problem, thank you so much for calling in have a good one buddy good luck with the Playstation 3 hunting that's gotta be a pain in the ass oh my god, oh you're a friend of Playstation 3 like Jamie, if I bought you a Playstation 3 you don't get anything else the rest of your life

855
00:50:18,237 --> 00:50:19,958
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

856
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,419
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want a PlayStation 3.

857
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,202
[SPEAKER_03]: If I gave you a PlayStation 3, you'd give it back.

858
00:50:25,082 --> 00:50:31,427
[SPEAKER_09]: No, if you gave me a PlayStation 3, honestly, I'd sell it on eBay for three times what it's worth and then I'd take us all to Disneyland.

859
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:32,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you want to answer the next call, Jamie?

860
00:50:32,968 --> 00:50:34,029
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I decided not to.

861
00:50:34,249 --> 00:50:34,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I will.

862
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:35,270
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's funny.

863
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:36,210
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

864
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:36,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

865
00:50:37,211 --> 00:50:40,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa, they rendered zebra genitalia.

866
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:42,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yuck.

867
00:50:42,695 --> 00:50:43,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to throw up my mouth.

868
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:44,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Jamie, answer the next call.

869
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:47,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you've called Orange Lounge Radio.

870
00:50:47,436 --> 00:50:48,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel special.

871
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:49,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are you?

872
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:52,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they hung up.

873
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,340
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't feel so special.

874
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:56,482
Bastards.

875
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,103
[SPEAKER_03]: They got you and decided to run the other way.

876
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you want to try this one instead?

877
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:02,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

878
00:51:03,946 --> 00:51:06,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you've called Orange Lounge Radio.

879
00:51:06,388 --> 00:51:09,510
[SPEAKER_17]: This guy's got a feminine voice.

880
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:15,368
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I talk too much, so... Oh, that's right.

881
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:17,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we're letting Jamie answer the calls.

882
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

883
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:22,093
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you talk enough.

884
00:51:22,553 --> 00:51:23,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

885
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:28,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways... What's on your mind, my friend?

886
00:51:29,578 --> 00:51:32,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, something you guys have completely overlooked.

887
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Next Saturday morning is the season premiere of Dance Revolution.

888
00:51:38,703 --> 00:51:40,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we overlooked it.

889
00:51:40,404 --> 00:51:41,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't care, my friend.

890
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:43,224
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't care.

891
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:44,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I will watch it.

892
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:46,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I will subject myself.

893
00:51:46,965 --> 00:51:49,306
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the ultimate in video game journalism right there.

894
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:51,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Self-sacrifice for the better of the community.

895
00:51:51,726 --> 00:51:56,587
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm sure that the entirety of our radio listeners can hear you pointing at Loki.

896
00:51:56,607 --> 00:52:02,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I sacrificed myself to watch Viva Pinata, and that show sucked.

897
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:06,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched the Viva Pinata clips on Xbox Live.

898
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:06,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was cute.

899
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:07,714
[SPEAKER_02]: You're stupid.

900
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:09,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerk.

901
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:15,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what else is on your mind, DMN?

902
00:52:17,984 --> 00:52:19,165
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't remember what else.

903
00:52:19,465 --> 00:52:27,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I was going to bug you guys with Dance Revolution, and the other thing slipped my mind, so I think we'll cut this one short and let you hang up on me.

904
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:28,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

905
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:30,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Click.

906
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think we have time for about one more call here.

907
00:52:35,991 --> 00:52:41,873
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, you can call our username is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can call our Skype line.

908
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 916-226-9067.

909
00:52:45,614 --> 00:52:46,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Megzy, call.

910
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:49,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Megzy's supposed to call us.

911
00:52:49,675 --> 00:52:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't she the one that hung up?

912
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:51,476
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

913
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:52,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Megzy.

914
00:52:52,956 --> 00:52:53,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try.

915
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:53,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

916
00:52:53,676 --> 00:52:55,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, are you going to answer this?

917
00:52:55,497 --> 00:52:55,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

918
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:57,097
[SPEAKER_05]: You better be Megzy.

919
00:52:57,117 --> 00:52:59,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is Megzy.

920
00:52:59,198 --> 00:52:59,418
Yay!

921
00:53:01,817 --> 00:53:02,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, hi.

922
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:05,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

923
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,120
[SPEAKER_03]: This must be Megzi.

924
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,282
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Megzi.

925
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:09,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

926
00:53:09,842 --> 00:53:11,063
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Megzi?

927
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:18,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first, anyone in the chat room who is listening, do not go to my genius site.

928
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:20,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not look at my bad art.

929
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,248
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not bad.

930
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:23,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Megzi, you're kind of breaking up.

931
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:23,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful.

932
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, better?

933
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:27,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, better, much better.

934
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:32,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to it.

935
00:53:32,204 --> 00:53:33,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all of her art.

936
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:33,645
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beautiful.

937
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:36,466
[SPEAKER_03]: That was during the bonus segment.

938
00:53:36,486 --> 00:53:38,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcasters didn't hear it anyway.

939
00:53:38,206 --> 00:53:39,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't worry about it.

940
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:41,007
[SPEAKER_08]: The majority of them won't go there.

941
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:47,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is about the conference.

942
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,370
[SPEAKER_08]: The Nintendo conference.

943
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:51,311
[SPEAKER_03]: What about it?

944
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:53,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

945
00:53:53,811 --> 00:53:54,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been waiting.

946
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:58,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I am counting the hours until the press conference.

947
00:53:58,567 --> 00:53:59,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a Reggie fangirl?

948
00:54:01,048 --> 00:54:03,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so totally a Reggie fangirl.

949
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:09,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope he gets up there and holds up his 40 and goes, This one's for my homies at OLR.

950
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:13,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Whee!

951
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,954
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you looking forward to seeing at the Wii press conference?

952
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:22,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just the date and the price to get the anticipation building so you can start taking pre-orders?

953
00:54:23,277 --> 00:54:25,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you hoping to see some new games or what?

954
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:32,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know when I can get it and how much it is and I want to be able to run my GameStop and throw my $50 down and say, how's that?

955
00:54:32,822 --> 00:54:34,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, really hope so.

956
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Cooter, Huggie, and he's the doctor off of Crams.

957
00:54:54,045 --> 00:54:55,366
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the doctor from all the Crams.

958
00:54:55,386 --> 00:54:56,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, sweetheart.

959
00:54:56,386 --> 00:54:56,886
I'm really happy now.

960
00:54:56,906 --> 00:54:57,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

961
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:58,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get to see her often, okay?

962
00:54:58,887 --> 00:54:59,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allowed to be sentimental.

963
00:54:59,627 --> 00:55:00,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cute.

964
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for letting me be sad about it on video.

965
00:55:24,707 --> 00:55:26,468
[SPEAKER_03]: That radio show is so gay.

966
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:28,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the iTunes review now.

967
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Gay video game radio.

968
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:30,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck iTunes.

969
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,132
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love iTunes.

970
00:55:33,192 --> 00:55:34,312
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where we get a lot of downloads from.

971
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:38,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last minute stories?

972
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes.

973
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I like burritos.

974
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:45,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, please help.

975
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,138
[SPEAKER_15]: GameTap is actually putting Sam and Max Hit the Road on its list of games.

976
00:56:12,054 --> 00:56:12,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn right.

977
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:15,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have a question for the chat.

978
00:56:15,357 --> 00:56:16,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But gay can mean happy, right?

979
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:19,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So just, you know, there's something for everybody.

980
00:56:20,402 --> 00:56:20,822
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy.

981
00:56:21,162 --> 00:56:22,063
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you have, Chris?

982
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:22,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a question.

983
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's played Xena Saga 3?

984
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:25,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And how good is it?

985
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:27,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a question.

986
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:27,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take a second.

987
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:28,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take a minute.

988
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:31,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Change of mind.

989
00:56:31,412 --> 00:56:32,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have anything else?

990
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:33,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

991
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:36,817
[SPEAKER_02]: For my birthday, people chipped in and got me surround sound.

992
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:43,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I have 5.1 surround sound in my living room with my widescreen TV and the 360.

993
00:56:44,616 --> 00:56:45,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

994
00:56:46,038 --> 00:56:46,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

995
00:56:46,618 --> 00:56:47,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it pretty?

996
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:48,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty.

997
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays Saints Row and I can hear the prostitutes yelling behind me so then I turn around and go beat their ass.

998
00:56:56,508 --> 00:56:57,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

999
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:58,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it awesome like a hot dog?

1000
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1001
00:56:59,671 --> 00:57:00,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a hot dog.

1002
00:57:01,154 --> 00:57:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo Maniac 64 says my friend has played it.

1003
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:06,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Funnydale said I heard that game has a six-hour cutscene.

1004
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:07,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that would work.

1005
00:57:08,278 --> 00:57:09,578
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN says it blows ass.

1006
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:11,079
Really?

1007
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:11,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1008
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:12,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he may not be talking.

1009
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,781
[SPEAKER_03]: He may just be talking, responding to somebody else again.

1010
00:57:17,943 --> 00:57:22,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody may have asked him, you know, what do you think about, you know, colonoscopies?

1011
00:57:23,425 --> 00:57:25,346
[SPEAKER_03]: He might have been responding to that question.

1012
00:57:25,406 --> 00:57:28,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma said if Reggie comes out with a 40, he better have cornrows.

1013
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:54,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Sephiroth 1215 says Xenosaga is $30 at Circuit City this week for those of you guys that like deals I already bought it I just haven't played it yet I actually was a moron and didn't get Xenosaga 2 when it came out so I have to order that and wait to play that or I can actually play Xenosaga 3 DMN is saying Xenosaga 3 is garbage is what?

1014
00:57:54,801 --> 00:58:00,724
[SPEAKER_08]: garbage fuck you, it's blue hair I gotta have blue hair

1015
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:05,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible that the game might suck, even though the first two were good?

1016
00:58:06,171 --> 00:58:08,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, again, I haven't played the first two.

1017
00:58:08,112 --> 00:58:09,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played two.

1018
00:58:09,593 --> 00:58:14,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like the first one, mainly because I like playing stuff with a storyline.

1019
00:58:15,515 --> 00:58:20,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't care if the storyline is bad, kind of, because I really like the art in three.

1020
00:58:22,257 --> 00:58:24,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like five-hour miniseries for cutscenes?

1021
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,138
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, it sounds like you'll love it.

1022
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:26,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

1023
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:29,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a game that plays itself.

1024
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1025
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:33,308
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a movie that you interact with.

1026
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:35,110
[SPEAKER_03]: You press the A button once in a while.

1027
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:42,554
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, with actual game news, Exo 6 is taking place in Barcelona on the 27th and 28th of September.

1028
00:58:43,095 --> 00:58:43,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1029
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:45,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet there's going to be big news out of that.

1030
00:58:46,977 --> 00:58:52,140
[SPEAKER_02]: They're expected to announce new franchises from Bungie.

1031
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:53,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff for Halo 3.

1032
00:58:54,022 --> 00:58:54,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fun stuff.

1033
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:04,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one last little tidbit here that's being sent to private message in chat.

1034
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:09,474
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a rumor going around that a Wii tech demo of sorts is going to come with a Wii remote purchase.

1035
00:59:10,034 --> 00:59:12,315
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a rumor, but that might be interesting.

1036
00:59:12,355 --> 00:59:13,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that stuff you saw at E3.

1037
00:59:13,536 --> 00:59:14,096
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1038
00:59:14,156 --> 00:59:14,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I collect tech demos.

1039
00:59:15,557 --> 00:59:18,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have like five of the old PlayStation tech demos.

1040
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:26,723
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to see something crazy, go back and look at the old tech demos on the PlayStation, and they look pretty damn good, even by today's standards.

1041
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:31,435
[SPEAKER_03]: See, DarkSakura can't say something nice about Sony once in a while.

1042
00:59:31,595 --> 00:59:32,436
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a PlayStation.

1043
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:33,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop hating.

1044
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:36,177
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, the PlayStation was born from the Super Nintendo.

1045
00:59:37,097 --> 00:59:37,978
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, yeah.

1046
00:59:38,638 --> 00:59:39,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So, huh.

1047
00:59:40,419 --> 00:59:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, boys and girls, that's going to bring this edition of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

1048
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us tonight.

1049
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:51,483
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate the fact that you guys tune in to us and support independent radio.

1050
00:59:51,503 --> 00:59:52,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys rock.

1051
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:55,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1052
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:57,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll start off with Drew Nami.

1053
00:59:57,529 --> 00:59:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami, thank you for being here tonight, as always.

1054
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:02,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's your final thought for tonight?

1055
01:00:03,352 --> 01:00:05,113
[SPEAKER_03]: No poo, thanks.

1056
01:00:05,874 --> 01:00:07,214

01:00:07,595 --> 01:00:09,676
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I love you guys.

1058
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry for making this place so random.

1059
01:00:11,837 --> 01:00:12,678
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we love you too.

1060
01:00:12,718 --> 01:00:13,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

1061
01:00:13,298 --> 01:00:13,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Random is fun.

1062
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:15,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school listeners especially love it.

1063
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought?

1064
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to take tomorrow off.

1065
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:24,188
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully we'll play some more games this week.

1066
01:00:24,248 --> 01:00:25,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take tomorrow off.

1067
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:26,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to take tomorrow off.

1068
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:30,650
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1069
01:00:33,811 --> 01:00:40,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had the best weekend ever and I owe it all to my bestest buddy right here.

1070
01:00:41,993 --> 01:00:43,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww, I think I threw up in my mouth.

1071
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:43,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

1072
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:44,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1073
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:47,575
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I want potato chips.

1074
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:49,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any left?

1075
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you.

1076
01:00:52,371 --> 01:00:57,833
[SPEAKER_09]: We are starting a campaign to call them crisps and to call French fries chips.

1077
01:00:58,414 --> 01:00:58,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1078
01:00:58,814 --> 01:00:59,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom fries?

1079
01:01:00,174 --> 01:01:01,415
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're chips.

1080
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:06,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention, and this is not that important, but it is news.

1081
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:14,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire and Mortar 2.81 came out for the PSP, which allows you to use memory sticks that are larger than 4 gigs.

1082
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:14,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurrah.

1083
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:17,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have one more final thought for you all.

1084
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:19,133
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1085
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:20,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

1086
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:22,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Owned!

1087
01:01:23,256 --> 01:01:24,297
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not pwnage.

1088
01:01:24,657 --> 01:01:26,779
[SPEAKER_09]: That is homage.

1089
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:28,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Pure ownage.

1090
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:31,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Imitation is the finest form of flattery, my dear.

1091
01:01:32,483 --> 01:01:33,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next week.

1092

1093
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Brace yourselves.

1094
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then, I'm a very scared Rob Roberts.

1095
01:01:44,092 --> 01:01:46,094
[SPEAKER_03]: For DarkSakura, Loki, and myself, goodnight.
