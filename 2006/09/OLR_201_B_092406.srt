00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

3
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:25,747
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 201 for this September the 24th of 2006.

5
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:45,318
[SPEAKER_14]: and we've got a case of the giggles sorry about that but that's part of our live segment that you can only hear when you listen to us live sorry podcast fans we have to do something special for the live listeners whether it be here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com or AllGames.com anyway we're going to get back into the news now however and I'm going to start off this segment of news

6
00:00:45,683 --> 00:00:46,825
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:06,709
[SPEAKER_14]: The console will be coming to New Zealand on December 7th.

8
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Wii Sports will be a pack-in game, just like here in the US.

9
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:19,602
[SPEAKER_14]: It will cost 499 New Zealand dollars, which translates to about 261 euros, 330 American dollars.

10
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:24,466
[SPEAKER_14]: So, by the way, New Zealand is actually having to pay a little bit more than Australia for that.

11
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:25,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Dope.

12
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:30,476
[SPEAKER_14]: But at least you get in the console relatively early and not getting the shaft on release dates.

13
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:33,418
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, at least that's some consolation, I hope.

14
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:34,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

15
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:34,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess.

16
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it just strike me funny that consolation is almost a pun?

17
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Consolation, yeah.

18
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:47,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, some of the news we actually talked about a while back was how the Wii wasn't going to have a digital audio out port.

19
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were wondering why that, you know, I think I made the point that that wasn't really important.

20
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:53,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

21
00:01:53,973 --> 00:02:03,661
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case now, it really isn't important because we found out that we will only be supporting Dolby ProLogic 2 technology.

22
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:10,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you can just use your standard red and white audio cables for that kind of stuff.

23
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:15,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess it's cool that it has some sort of quasi-surround sound to it.

24
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:23,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not that it really needs too much since it has the speaker and the controller which I guess they could use for some semi-surround sound, but

25
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:25,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

26
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:29,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not a surprise when the game isn't, you know, HD, you know, really anyways.

27
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:31,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's just me.

28
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:36,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me go out here on a limb, and I'm sure to piss somebody off with this, you know, thing I'm about to say, but whatever.

29
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:37,467
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my view.

30
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:45,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really get all like, oh, gosh, the sound in this game was so crystal clear amazing.

31
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:53,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, when I shot that guy in the face, I could really hear that in full, you know, 31.11 surround super uber Dolby sound or whatever.

32
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:54,715
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:33,572
[SPEAKER_07]: After having played games in Surround Sound, oh hell yeah, especially for anything that's scary, where those little side noises are gonna... Especially since you've got your speaker in the Wii controller, having that full Surround Sound... Okay, do you want to go see your movie in just mono, or do you want to see it in Surround Sound?

34
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:36,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, it depends.

35
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,196
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm watching a comedy...

36
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:39,632
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't really matter.

37
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:44,275
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have the capability to play it in surround sound, don't you want the full effect?

38
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:53,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of weird, though, that it does have a speaker in the controller, because they're trying to make it more immersive, and yet they're not supporting immersive sound.

39
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:54,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

40
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me phrase it this way.

41
00:03:56,424 --> 00:04:00,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never had a crappy sound system take the game experience away from me, I guess.

42
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I've just played the wrong games on those uber surround systems.

43
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,113
[SPEAKER_14]: I really haven't played a lot of survival horror on those systems, so maybe I'm just not playing the right games.

44
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:08,433
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

45
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,198
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the game.

46
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:26,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if it isn't much of a surprise, of course, the same info came out this week that Dolby is also going to be providing the sound technology for the PlayStation 3, including Dolby Digital's 5.1 surround, and you better believe that they're going to be pushing this crap.

47
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:31,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony will also be supporting Dolby's true HD sound for decoding up to 7.1 channels.

48
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:36,985
[SPEAKER_02]: for playback of movie titles in the Blu-ray disc format and probably games.

49
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:40,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's kind of interesting, you know, that they're supporting this technology.

50
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:51,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going to be pushing those wonderful Sony 7.1 systems now so you can get your 7.1 system and your 1080p, you know, plasma screen TV and spend uber money on stuff that you probably don't need.

51
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:52,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw that.

52
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:55,741
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want something good, get a Harman Kardon and Bose surround speakers.

53
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:57,562
[SPEAKER_07]: No contest.

54
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,464
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we've got in my house.

55
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um...

56
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:07,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that actually is cool for some if you manage to get in on it and not so cool for others.

57
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:12,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazon has sold out of pre-orders for the Wii.

58
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:13,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

59
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:14,869
[SPEAKER_07]: No more.

60
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So go to your GameStop and wait until they do pre-orders.

61
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, how long was that up?

62
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,950
[SPEAKER_14]: An hour?

63
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Two hours?

64
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably had to shut that off pretty quick.

65
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about a couple hours.

66
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:28,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why they stopped pre-orders is because they don't have their allocations yet.

67
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:29,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what they're getting.

68
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to restart pre-orders once they figure that out.

69
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:35,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of an error, I guess, on taking the pre-orders right now.

70
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:40,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can tell you right now, at least as far as I've last asked, GameStop's not taking pre-orders on them yet.

71
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been calling them every day.

72
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:44,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm annoying.

73
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:45,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I ask my husband every day.

74
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:48,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they know you by name when you call?

75
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:56,121
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't, but I always preface the call with, I'm sorry to ask this, but, you know, because I'm sure they get the call, like 700 calls.

76
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:59,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think news will hit the internet when they're going to start taking pre-orders?

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I want to know first because I don't want to hear it from second hand because then people already know and they're already there.

78
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather call them right when they open up and say, hey, are you taking pre-orders?

79
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:10,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll tell you this.

80
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,015
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I find out when GameStop is taking pre-orders, we will have an announcement.

81
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So as soon as I can actually say something.

82
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,863
[SPEAKER_14]: You think we'll be able to beat some of the big boys to it?

83
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:23,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

84
00:06:23,823 --> 00:06:24,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

85
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:24,924
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

86
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:25,624
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

87
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:27,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing as how I hear all the drama that goes on.

88
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you should share some of that drama with us.

89
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:30,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't share some of the drama.

90
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn, what kind of radio is that?

91
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:33,427
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

92
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:39,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, one thing that's causing a little bit of drama, as you know, last week we talked about, oh, the Wii is region free.

93
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's not region free.

94
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,217
[SPEAKER_14]: It's free, it's not free, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

95
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:48,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it looks like there are plenty more votes for not region-free.

96
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:58,489
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, representatives from Nintendo of America confirmed to 1UP.com earlier this week that the Wii will be region-encoded by territory.

97
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:00,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Wah, wah.

98
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:07,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Which means, unfortunately, if you want to play Japanese Wii games, you will have to purchase a Japanese Wii or wait for a hack.

99
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,710
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be there.

100
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:11,972
[SPEAKER_07]: It will either be a physical one or something as simple as a disc.

101
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:20,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it seems to me that if this is like a last-minute decision by them, that it's going to be something half-assed for the reason of protection.

102
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:28,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't see why they're putting so much effort into it since they've never really given half a crap before because it's always been something easy.

103
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Nintendo, if you're listening, Reggie, if you're listening to our podcast...

104
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

105
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:38,202
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

106
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:39,563
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's evidence.

107
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:46,146
[SPEAKER_14]: If Nintendo is listening to this, here's evidence that Region Free will work.

108
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:47,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Elite Beat Agents.

109
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:50,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I will bet you anything that game sells like hotcakes.

110
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

111
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:57,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Because so many people purchased the import version and let their friends play it that I bet that game is going to sell like crazy.

112
00:07:57,872 --> 00:08:01,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't have happened if you didn't have the Region Free DS.

113
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:02,975
[SPEAKER_14]: That wouldn't have happened.

114
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:06,177
[SPEAKER_14]: And I bet you Elite Beat Agents possibly wouldn't have even come out here.

115
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:19,360
[SPEAKER_07]: It would make more sense to have a universal launch, have the same games come out, except for the really crappy American-centered games and the really quirky Japanese-centered games.

116
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that region coding is pretty much going to shoot them in the ass.

117
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:26,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't worked yet.

118
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:30,283
[SPEAKER_14]: It's interesting because some folks in the chat room are saying, you know what?

119
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:31,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I still don't believe it.

120
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:38,632
[SPEAKER_14]: So what if this big, foofy website called their rep at Nintendo?

121
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:40,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Reps have been wrong before.

122
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:41,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

123
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:48,081
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess there is a little bit of hope that perhaps this system could possibly still be region-free.

124
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:48,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope so.

125
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:50,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Reggie, if you're listening, I love you, dude.

126
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:52,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Please make it region-free.

127
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:56,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think... It'd be nice, but I don't think they will.

128
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

129
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:58,751
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

130
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,024
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

131
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:21,597
[SPEAKER_14]: and cutesy Elebits and Pokemon.

132
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:22,877
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, it's Grand Theft Auto.

133
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:23,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:24,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you were talking about Nintendo.

135
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo's usually known for the cutesy games.

136
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,880
[SPEAKER_02]: There is nothing I want more in this world to be able to beat a hooker with a Wiimote.

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be the... I will be able to die after doing that.

138
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:40,423
You probably will.

139
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:45,225
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to add is like, you know, Pimp Slap with the Wii Remote.

140
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it'll be just awesome.

141
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:50,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait for, you know, them to actually put out something.

142
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:56,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Although they're probably going to bring out fucking Table Tennis for the... Hey, now wait a minute, wait a minute.

143
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:58,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Table Tennis with the Wii Con could be pretty rad.

144
00:09:58,693 --> 00:09:59,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't knock it until you've tried it.

145
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:01,114
[SPEAKER_14]: That might be kind of fun.

146
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:08,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Table Tennis Extreme where I can take off people's heads with the fucking ball.

147
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

148
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,503
[SPEAKER_07]: We need freaking wire work ping pong.

149
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,363
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do clips and shit with the ball.

150
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:16,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

151
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm glad at least they're opening it up for M-rated games to hopefully remove this kind of impression that Nintendo is only for kids.

152
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:31,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think this console would be a lot better if they just get past that.

153
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,731
[SPEAKER_02]: and publishers realize, okay, this is going to appeal to everybody.

154
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:36,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Including people that like to beat hookers with a stick.

155
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:42,717
[SPEAKER_14]: GS191 in our chatroom says, oh great, hot coffee mod with Wiimote functionality.

156
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:44,878
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you do?

157
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Stroke the Wiimote?

158
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it have a sensor on the side?

159
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it has a sensor for that.

160
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,902
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll have an attachment.

161
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:51,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross.

162
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:51,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross!

163
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:51,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross!

164
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:00,210
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:34,196
[SPEAKER_07]: My first FU of the week.

166
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a very serious matter.

167
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:43,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I found out today that my cousin-in-law died from AIDS.

168
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,462
[SPEAKER_07]: He developed pneumonia, fell into a coma two weeks ago, and they pulled life support today.

169
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:54,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd just like to say a big FU to communicable diseases and people who don't take proper precautions.

170
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:57,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that was his case, but I'm just saying...

171
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody, just please make sure either do it safely or don't do it at all.

172
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:06,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the proper precautions.

173
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:08,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear that.

174
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:10,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

175
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:17,996
[SPEAKER_02]: My FQs of the week, or I should say FQ of the week, goes to a local church actually nearby here.

176
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:23,441
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a story that came out that they were, basically the city has

177
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:51,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Told them that they cannot have their Christian rock bands come in anymore Because they have this thing going on during the weekends called Club Retro or some crap like that Where they have bands come in and stuff and they worship and whatever crap they do Anyways, so this has been going on for years now And they've received numerous complaints because they are too noisy So they have filed basically this thing saying that Well, you're running a nightclub

178
00:12:52,173 --> 00:13:19,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically in this church, and this area is not zoned for a nightclub Plus you are being too noisy and there's too much problem with littering You guys are praying too loud Exactly, and so they're doing this silent protest in front of the church Saying that this is unfair, that they're taking away their right to worship And I say they're fucking retarded Because they know exactly why they are being, you know

179
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:23,584
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're worshipping someone who's omniscient and omnipresent, you can go, thanks God, and God will hear you.

180
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,632
[SPEAKER_07]: You can raise a joyful noise unto the Lord, but don't do it to where your neighbors wake up.

181
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:59,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like nothing more for them to lose their ability to actually have this rock band that would make me so super happy.

182
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:01,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably what's going to happen.

183
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Go government!

184
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:06,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

185
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,458
[SPEAKER_14]: We should get some emails on that one.

186
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,280
[SPEAKER_14]: My FU of the week, I was going to do this big old thing, but I'm just going to pass this week.

187
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,802
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm mad at a lot of things, but it's really none of your business.

188
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:18,296
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that's it.

189
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:19,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Drew Nami.

190
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:22,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I'm sorry, I had to step in here real quick.

191
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Microsoft, for your crappy vision camera.

192
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I cannot focus this thing for... I bet you it's just defective.

193
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:29,922
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crap.

194
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:31,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Drew Nami.

195
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:35,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, first of all, this game, games related FU.

196
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:40,307
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the fucking stealth segments in Dirge of Cerberus.

197
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:44,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate it when otherwise good action games

198
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly lapses in this forced stealth segment.

199
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.

200
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:47,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

201
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:49,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate stealth games.

202
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:54,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never be good at a stealth game, so why force me into these stealth segments?

203
00:14:55,207 --> 00:15:01,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And second of all, FU2, the current arcade management at local Country Club Lane.

204
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:05,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I went there yesterday with Dark Studio from Chatroom.

205
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:11,341
[SPEAKER_03]: They had no less than five machines out of order, including In the Groove and several racing games.

206
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:12,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

207
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get back into the gaming news, shall we?

208
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, and we have some news for our UK listeners.

209
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:49,363
[SPEAKER_07]: The PAL version of Final Fantasy XII will be out in early 2007.

210
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:54,584
[SPEAKER_07]: In the US, of course, the release date is October 31st.

211
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,366
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's funny.

212
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:03,447
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a quote by the Square Enix CEO of Europe.

213
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:08,951
[SPEAKER_07]: John Yamamoto saying that it looks set to become one of the crowning glories of PlayStation 2.

214
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:10,532
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me laugh.

215
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:14,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't really think that Final Fantasy XII is all that fantastic.

216
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:15,615
[SPEAKER_07]: The battle system in it is kind of bizarre.

217
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:19,877
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you can probably see videos of it online.

218
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:27,601
[SPEAKER_07]: You play through as a princess and some dude hanging out with her to try to rescue their home.

219
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:28,762
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has...

220
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:31,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Active Battle.

221
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:34,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking A, that's the exact same plot of Enchanted Arms right now, actually.

222
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear to God, it is.

223
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:42,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a real-time exploration and this active dimension battle thing.

224
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:49,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you have this big line that comes from you to whatever your target is, and it's really stupid.

225
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:51,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And then your command screen pops up, and you can do that.

226
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,550
[SPEAKER_07]: You can switch your targets.

227
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,830
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it doesn't work.

228
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:56,411
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked it, FYI.

229
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:01,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried really hard to give it a chance.

230
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:02,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to get the game.

231
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:08,970
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also love Final Fantasy XI, and you thought you were going to go crazy.

232
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave Final Fantasy XI a chance.

233
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,350
[SPEAKER_11]: You did.

234
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I make it to level 24, White Mage?

235
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:15,312
[SPEAKER_11]: You did.

236
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:15,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

237
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:19,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But you do talk a lot of shit about Final Fantasy XI.

238
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:20,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, at least you tried it.

239
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:20,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you that.

240
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:25,875
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I have room to talk shit about people who abuse their White Mages.

241
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,010
[SPEAKER_13]: White mages are people too!

242
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Heal, please.

243
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you.

244
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Heal, please.

245
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Port, please.

246
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:34,931
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.

247
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:39,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, see, I decided... My last party, I got revenge.

248
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:41,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I let our tank die, and then I killed all the critters.

249
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was subbing Black Mage.

250
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:46,294
[SPEAKER_07]: You are a heal bot.

251
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:48,775
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not a heal bot.

252
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:50,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Black Mage in disguise.

253
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:50,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Heal, please.

254
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:51,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

255
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:52,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Regen, please.

256
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:54,516
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's why I will not... Please.

257
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,921
[SPEAKER_07]: That is why I will not play Priests in Ragnarok.

258
00:17:57,602 --> 00:18:03,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, at least with a Priest in Ragnarok, you can do random teleports and drop people in glass time.

259
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:05,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

260
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotta agree with you on that.

261
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,914
[SPEAKER_03]: When I played Ragnarok Online with you, what did I say to everyone?

262
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:14,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't heal.

263
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a battle alkali.

264
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:16,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

265
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you can actually take Monk.

266
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and that fucking kicks ass.

267
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I should start playing... I am no one's heel box.

268
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start playing Ragnarok again because I have my level 50-something assassin.

269
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:29,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I remember her.

270
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:30,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, have fun.

271
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:32,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, I'll be playing Final Fantasy XII.

272
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:33,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Addict!

273
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:35,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Traitor addict!

274
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:36,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Before all our fans in Europe.

275
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:38,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, guys.

276
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:41,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll still be playing World of Warcraft after my burnout wears off.

277
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,741
[SPEAKER_07]: You are a TA.

278
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:44,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

279
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:44,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

280
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I not say in Part A that I went back to WoW?

281
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:50,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't touched Final Fantasy XI in two weeks and Shane's very mad at me for that.

282
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:52,576
[SPEAKER_14]: So give me that.

283
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,097
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'm going to play Final Fantasy XII.

284
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:57,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to play it before our British friends.

285
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, guys, but I just can't wait any longer.

286
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:01,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let you all know how it is, though.

287
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:03,698
[SPEAKER_14]: And, yeah, that's it.

288
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:08,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, damn, Rob, where MMOs are concerned, you can't do anything without pissing someone off, can you?

289
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,899
[SPEAKER_07]: That means you're a bipolar MMO-er.

290
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

291
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

292
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?

293
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,100
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

294
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,621
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's interesting?

295
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:22,952
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Final Fantasy so much, yet I still have not watched Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

296
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:27,656
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why, I just can't frickin' sit down for an hour and a half to watch it.

297
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:28,597
[SPEAKER_03]: This you must do.

298
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:40,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, anyway, actually, what's been going on is that at Tokyo Game Show, Square Enix has revealed a new version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children with the subtitle, Complete, is going to be released.

299
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:41,709
[SPEAKER_14]: It's...

300
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:43,117
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

301
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:19,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I have to find somebody who owns a Blu-ray player or camp out and watch it at Best Buy or something on the TV there.

302
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,356
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

303
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see that.

304
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:29,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's one thing we talked about last week, which was the Kingdom Hearts Final Mix.

305
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:36,884
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually going to be including a PlayStation 2 remake of Chain of Memories in it as well.

306
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:41,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will be able to get some nice...

307
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Chain of Memories is actually going on.

308
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:49,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell from experience, by the way, that Chain of Memories on a Game Boy Micro is a pain in the ass.

309
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:54,928
[SPEAKER_14]: But now you can play it on PlayStation 2, nice and big and huge and all that good stuff.

310
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:58,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I can play it on my Macro and play it at work.

311
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at school.

312
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:07,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the game's going to feature full 3D graphics as well as some event cutscenes that will feature the voices in Japanese, not English.

313
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:11,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says they were kind of scarce on the details.

314
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Saga Loves Us Saga Loves Us

315
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:30,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Sega of America.

316
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:30,814
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they don't.

317
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,434
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't put out Jumbo Safari.

318
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:33,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know what?

319
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:36,555
[SPEAKER_07]: They're bringing a Shining Force EXA to PS2.

320
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:38,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I guess I can give that.

321
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:39,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love Shining Force.

322
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:41,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the old ones.

323
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:42,616
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my new background network.

324
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:46,217
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a screenshot from Shining Force EXA.

325
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:48,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a Jumbo Safari background.

326
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:50,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Charm, please assist.

327
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:53,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be an action RPG, um...

328
00:21:54,605 --> 00:22:09,229
[SPEAKER_07]: it's going to be taking more of the strategy lean although they're not giving any major specifics on that and there is no release date yet announced but it's Shining Force hey Shining Force is awesome

329
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:16,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, one thing that's not so awesome is a lawsuit, especially when you're on the receiving end.

330
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:20,166
[SPEAKER_14]: And this week, the Ant Commandos have been on the receiving end of a lawsuit.

331
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:27,729
[SPEAKER_14]: The Ant Commandos are a California-based company that sells Guitar Hero peripherals, specifically a wireless guitar controller.

332
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:28,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, guess what?

333
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Red Octane has come in and sued their asses.

334
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:31,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

335
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:31,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

336
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:01,668
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I will say this.

337
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:09,152
[SPEAKER_14]: At one point, didn't Konami officially recognize Red Octane as like their, you know, their cool?

338
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:12,433
[SPEAKER_14]: We recognize them as like a pad manufacturer.

339
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:14,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say at one point they did.

340
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:15,735
[SPEAKER_14]: On top of that, no.

341
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:16,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm almost positive.

342
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:17,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Red Octane didn't.

343
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Until In The Groove came out, then all bets were off.

344
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:26,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Red Octane also didn't actually go and use the official DDR logo on their product.

345
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,471
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say, we are doing this for Konami.

346
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:32,592
[SPEAKER_07]: The Konami logo didn't show up anywhere on there.

347
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:38,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen these wireless guitar controllers, and I played one, and it's complete ass.

348
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:50,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if I were Red Octane, and this company is going out using our logo and our name, and putting out this utter crap product, I would definitely sue.

349
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:54,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other side of it is just stupid, too, because...

350
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you had more to that, didn't you?

351
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:56,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I will.

352
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Kage in our chatroom, I just wanted to say, made it funny.

353
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:02,596
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard they hired Edgeworth to rep the prosecution side.

354
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,059
Beep!

355
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:06,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Objection!

356
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Objection!

357
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,221
Beep!

358
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:09,141
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

359
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:12,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even Von Karma can make that argument work.

360
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:17,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the Ant Commandos were not going to take this lying down, and with a name like Ant Commandos, you wouldn't expect them to.

361
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:19,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't they sound pretty hardcore?

362
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,931
[SPEAKER_14]: They sound like a shitty indie band.

363
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:21,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

364
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:30,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the Ant Commandos actually have countersued Red Octane and given this timeline as their proof.

365
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,133
[SPEAKER_14]: 1999, Topway Electrical Appliances, a part owner of TAC, patents...

366
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:38,396
[SPEAKER_14]: The Magical Guitar Controller for Konami's Guitar Freaks.

367
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:42,437
[SPEAKER_14]: The design had five fret buttons, very similar to what Guitar Hero has now.

368
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:52,359
[SPEAKER_14]: 2001 to 2004, the CEO of Red Octane, as well as the sales manager, made several visits to a Topway factory in China and inquired about the Magical Guitar Controller.

369
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:57,840
[SPEAKER_14]: From 2001 to 2004, Red Octane purchased several hundred Magical Guitar Controllers.

370
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:03,802
[SPEAKER_14]: And in 2005, Red Octane releases Guitar Hero with a controller that looks exactly like the Magical Guitar.

371
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:09,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say that because they licensed the body shape for their guitars from Gibson.

372
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:10,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold it.

373
00:25:11,854 --> 00:25:13,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a little bit of a flaw here.

374
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:20,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you make a guitar controller with five fret buttons for a guitar freak which only has three?

375
00:25:21,295 --> 00:25:22,937
[SPEAKER_14]: There was an Emco game.

376
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:45,563
[SPEAKER_14]: I never understood why they did that either.

377
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we know.

378
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:52,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was arcade only, though, but I think there was a Namco... I know there's a Namco arcade guitar game.

379
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:01,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I went digging through their Japanese site one time and found this and some type of keyboard sim that they did, too, but I didn't know if they ever had a home version of that.

380
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:04,279
[SPEAKER_07]: If they did, then that makes sense.

381
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, if they had a home version of it, we would have heard of it.

382
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:11,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

383
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:14,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

384
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, besides the fact that Red Octane used to make DDR pads, does anyone find this kind of funny that they're using almost the same terminology as the whole Indigroove DDR thing?

385
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:28,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but technically, is the Indigroove thing against them?

386
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:35,577
[SPEAKER_02]: That's technically what Rockstar, but I think Red Octane may fall into that a little bit because they distribute the home version.

387
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:37,758
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say they got pulled into some addendum.

388
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:41,780
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been so long since we covered that case now, and we haven't really heard a lot on it, which is a little bit odd.

389
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

390
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:47,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Search the court doc system and see if anything new has come out recently because there might have been a quiet settlement or something.

391
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

392
00:26:49,113 --> 00:26:51,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be very interesting if there was.

393
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:52,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

394
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:58,435
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank the chat room for sending me various Jumbo Safari pictures for use on my background.

395
00:26:58,475 --> 00:26:59,395
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that, folks.

396
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:01,476
[SPEAKER_14]: God, I love OLR chatters.

397
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:03,496
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

398
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, another thing we love is OLR emailers.

399
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:11,238
[SPEAKER_14]: And every week you send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

400
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:13,346
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

401
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:37,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, um...

402
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:02,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Game Soundtracks

403
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:26,494
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes you can find these at your local comic book store, I found.

404
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:31,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually sells, at least the local one here now sells, anime and video game import CDs.

405
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:33,216
[SPEAKER_07]: They've actually been selling them for quite a few years here.

406
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:34,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

407
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've also got conventions.

408
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:38,038
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

409
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:40,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Your conventions, you've got online ordering.

410
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I've ordered CDs through Amazon, actually.

411
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I order all my UK Guerrilla stuff on Amazon.

412
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:46,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

413
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:54,365
[SPEAKER_07]: another PS that's on here I'm going to Granville Island on October 3rd if you can tell me some details about the cookie shop

414
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:59,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I would gladly purchase some cookies for OLR as a 200th gift and buy some for myself.

415
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:06,307
[SPEAKER_14]: All I remember is that the guy who sold it sold nothing but maple stuff, which I'm sure in Canada, you know, is probably pretty common, sorry.

416
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:14,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just remember the guy was right near an entrance, he sold nothing but maple stuff, and he had cookies were on one side, and he would give a free sample if you wanted it.

417
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:17,357
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take a picture of the box and put it on the forums.

418
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:17,758
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that?

419
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:18,919
[SPEAKER_14]: And that'll give you something to look for.

420
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I might still have the box somewhere.

421
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Send us some if we pay shipping.

422
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:22,688
[SPEAKER_14]: I just might.

423
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I like maple cookies.

424
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:25,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maple's delicious.

425
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I need something to remind me of Vancouver, because I want to go back, but I'm poor.

426
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:44,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we also had a nice article sent to us by Robway, and it's on Planet Xbox 360, which came first, the violence or the video game.

427
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:46,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And there it is.

428
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:46,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

429
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:19,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as the next mail is concerned, kind of a long one.

430
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray, long emails.

431
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:25,662
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually from McFloyd.

432
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:35,568
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Dear OLR crew, I've been listening to your podcast for over a year and a half now, so I thought it was really about time I expressed my thoughts on the show.

433
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:37,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's really sweet.

434
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:37,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

435
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:00,767
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

436
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:14,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

437
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:38,666
[SPEAKER_07]: This next part actually has a lot of good insight.

438
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:42,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to comment on the gaming laws and people against video gaming.

439
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:43,428
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are completely right.

440
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,189
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a violation of our First Amendment rights.

441
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:48,811
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is a free country, people have to have the right to express themselves however they want.

442
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:54,093
[SPEAKER_07]: By banning one thing, issues for similar things will come up and from those issues from other issues.

443
00:31:54,773 --> 00:31:56,974
[SPEAKER_07]: What about violent or sexually explicit movies or music?

444
00:31:56,994 --> 00:32:00,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to ban those things and make it illegal for a minor to possess them at all or to view them?

445
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:04,297
[SPEAKER_07]: The government has no right to control what we see, what we hear, what we do.

446
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:05,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Also,

447
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:12,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, as being allowed to buy violent video games to play them, what will they do instead?

448
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:15,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we'll end up with more violence in real life.

449
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:25,846
[SPEAKER_07]: The adults who are trying to get these laws passed neither understand video games nor see how video games are developing and are blindly scared of this new trend of kids playing these games more and more.

450
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:31,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games are actually becoming more and more active with such games as DDR Guitar Hero and the Wii controllers evolving from previous ideas.

451
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:38,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, the email goes a little bit further into the educational games like Brain Age, Civilization.

452
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:40,033
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a fan of Civilization.

453
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:40,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

454
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Games that are, you know, helping.

455
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this person a lot.

456
00:32:45,216 --> 00:32:53,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say if you're going to high school and have this type of insight, I am looking forward to see what you're like at a high school.

457
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:56,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, consider what he said his dad does, too.

458
00:32:56,423 --> 00:32:58,364
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a diplomat, so it's kind of interesting.

459
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,782
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes this insight especially interesting, knowing that the dad is in this very political position.

460
00:33:06,202 --> 00:33:07,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I like what's said here.

461
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:11,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Adults should understand that this is... Let me get back to where I was.

462
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Adults should understand that this is...

463
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:22,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the New Age of People and help children choose games that are appropriate, active, or even educational if need be, helping them understand the issues in the more violent games.

464
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:27,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games are very different from what they experienced as children, and learning by doing is the best way.

465
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So video games have a huge potential in not only letting people have fun, but in teaching the things that they'll remember much better.

466
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:46,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last paragraph, I'll just read that, it says, Finally, although this is just a little late, congratulations on your 200 episodes, so Loki, DarkSakura, Sky, keep up the great work, and I'm looking forward to 200 more episodes.

467
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,560
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll try.

468
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:55,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I would actually, if you're listening, I hope you are, I would actually like your permission to put this one up on our forum.

469
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:56,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Letter of the Week!

470
00:33:56,806 --> 00:33:57,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Letter of the Week!

471
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,634
[SPEAKER_14]: and not just because they kissed our ass, but it helps.

472
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:03,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very well thought out email.

473
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:07,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for anyone that's in the chat room that might have an Xbox Live Vision camera.

474
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:10,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it fucking blurry as mine is?

475
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Because seriously, I cannot focus this thing no matter what kind of light is in the room, no matter if it's trying to focus something far away, close, it does not matter.

476
00:34:20,363 --> 00:34:21,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so goddamn blurry.

477
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:27,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Goddamn, here we are trying to say something nice about a listener and it all comes back to me, me, me, me, me, doesn't it, Loki?

478
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:27,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it does.

479
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,260
[SPEAKER_14]: You selfish ass.

480
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:32,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious.

481
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:34,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't.

482
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:35,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this thing to work.

483
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:40,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want it to work so I can play Uno and make funny faces at people and stuff like that.

484
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:46,149
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't do that until it's not blurry because I just look like a fucking ghost in this thing.

485
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:47,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't work.

486
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, SSJ100Matter said, Loki, it's your face.

487
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:53,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not my face because I pointed at you too and you're still blurry.

488
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:54,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So tough.

489
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:56,275
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm beautiful.

490
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,316
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you get for watching the videotape.

491
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven days you're going to die.

492
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,045
[SPEAKER_14]: God punishing you because you're complaining about the praisers at the church making a lot of noise.

493
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,046
[SPEAKER_07]: But he was messing with that beforehand.

494
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:12,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand how I can clean the lens seeing as I just opened this thing up.

495
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:14,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how would it be dirty already?

496
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, email.

497
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:16,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Email's nice.

498
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:17,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, email.

499
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:19,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, OLR.

500
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:20,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, listener.

501
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:21,495
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from DNL.

502
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:22,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

503
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:23,597
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you, DNL.

504
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:26,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy episode 201.

505
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that I didn't get a chance to wish you guys a happy 200, but the biggest part of reaching a milestone is the aftermath.

506
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:37,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Though I've only been on the show once, live at B3, when I met Rob for the first time.

507
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that when me and Megumi decided to run away?

508
00:35:41,111 --> 00:35:41,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.

509
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:51,095
[SPEAKER_14]: B3 was this big DDR tournament that took place at Pier 39 in San Francisco, and this was probably in about our second year of existence that we did the B3 thing.

510
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:55,016
[SPEAKER_14]: We weren't quite to 100 yet, but we were definitely getting old.

511
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:57,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Megumi and I were really hungry.

512
00:35:58,437 --> 00:35:59,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you what...

513
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:10,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing live radio coverage for two days straight takes a lot of talent that I'm not so sure we all have.

514
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, I wish I had recordings of some of that old stuff, and I just might somewhere.

515
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:22,815
[SPEAKER_14]: But I seem to recall there was one DDR tournament that we covered that Loki ended up sitting in the back and he's just going, Yeah...

516
00:36:23,522 --> 00:36:25,643
[SPEAKER_14]: So, DDR tournament going on.

517
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:28,644
[SPEAKER_14]: There was somebody sitting in the back row of the microphone.

518
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:30,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for hours, and I had a cold.

519
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God, that was so funny.

520
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:33,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a shaft.

521
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:35,047
[SPEAKER_13]: What's it?

522
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,168
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a shaft.

523
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:36,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I hated it.

524
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:38,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I was busy with the tournament and the fried Twinkies.

525
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:42,391
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, Megumi and I ended up leaving the tournament.

526
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:52,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, not meaning to cut in on the email, I would also like to give Megumi and her fiancé congratulations on their upcoming wedding.

527
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:54,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay weddings!

528
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:55,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay everybody getting married but me!

529
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I make no comment.

530
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:04,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Being married is not all it's cracked up to be.

531
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:10,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I've been listening on and off for three years, but started listening regularly as soon as there was a podcast.

532
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:11,836
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right from the very beginning.

533
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:13,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob, he's so nice.

534
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:26,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I had only seen him twice before, both at competitions, but when we bumped into each other, literally, at the Dear Friends concert before E3 2004, and he remembered my name and even introduced me to the awesome VXJasonXV, the amazing mod.

535
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:29,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was Roscoe's, but enough with the reminiscing.

536
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:31,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers to another X amount of episodes.

537
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:35,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Renee is just the cutest girl you'll ever meet.

538
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:37,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, she's adorable.

539
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,390
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to come on the show, Renee.

540
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're listening.

541
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:40,851
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to come on the show.

542
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:42,692
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I want to...

543
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,300
[SPEAKER_14]: RAD We love our international friends.

544
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:15,296
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one is from Ranma.

545
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:25,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Ranchan has decided to email us, so I'm gonna go over the highlights of this email, okay?

546
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:27,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi all, Ranma here.

547
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:29,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that how he also greets us on Skype?

548
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:30,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.

549
00:38:31,604 --> 00:38:33,185
[SPEAKER_14]: You're on the show too damn much, Ranma.

550
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:33,545
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

551
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:34,086
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

552
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:34,987
[SPEAKER_07]: What's he got to say?

553
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:35,647
[SPEAKER_07]: We love Ranma.

554
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:36,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we do.

555
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:44,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I truly enjoyed episode 200 and I listened to it again on my way to work last week and I just have to say that you, Jamie, are truly a voice in the female gaming.

556
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:50,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I have had a few female gamers on my friends list, but you by far are the most vocal and outspoken of them all.

557
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:51,879
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just because I'm a bitch.

558
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I truly respect you for that and don't ever lose that edge of yours.

559
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:56,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you.

560
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:02,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Anywho, there are a couple things I wanted to point out from a couple past episodes just in case I missed tonight's episode.

561
00:39:03,097 --> 00:39:04,137
[SPEAKER_07]: One, price of the Wii Remote.

562
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:05,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why people are angry over the price.

563
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:10,221
[SPEAKER_07]: The standard Xbox 360 pad is $50, and I don't hear anyone complain about that one.

564
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:13,484
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii Remote is more than just a controller.

565
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:16,726
[SPEAKER_07]: It has more features than any other next-gen controller out there, and it's less expensive.

566
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, Techno DDR Heaven.

567
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:23,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So about two weeks ago, I was with my friends at South Street Seaport, and we heard some techno music.

568
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:26,598
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend Carmen said, Is it wrong to think of DDR when hearing techno?

569
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:28,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I replied, It's not wrong.

570
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the groove.

571
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:31,922
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not wrong unless it's in the groove.

572
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:35,686
[SPEAKER_07]: And we laughed and got closer, and the song was Heaven from DDR Max US 1, I think.

573
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:37,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured you'd all get a laugh out of that.

574
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:38,368
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pretty funny.

575
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Three, Enchanted Arms Gay Voice.

576
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:43,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Rob, I totally agree with that.

577
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:45,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I was listening to...

578
00:39:46,226 --> 00:39:51,429
[SPEAKER_07]: FF12 Day I am excited about this and I will be there as Black Mage I will take pictures for all

579
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:16,356
[SPEAKER_07]: 5.

580
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,356
[SPEAKER_07]: SNK new hardware.

581
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,977
[SPEAKER_07]: What SNK needs to do is make better hardware technology.

582
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:25,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time they make a game on their normal equipment, in less than three weeks after it's out, the ROMs of it are totally found online.

583
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,202
[SPEAKER_07]: In my honest opinion, that's a major reason why they are losing money.

584
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:30,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, true.

585
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:32,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I was one of the people that paid $390 for KOF 2000, but...

586
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:39,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's I'm Staying In.

587
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:40,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for playing that.

588
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:44,662
[SPEAKER_07]: The song reminded me of how long I've been listening to you guys.

589
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I truly thank Raichan for telling me about you guys.

590
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,786
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised we didn't get more emails on that.

591
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:51,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God.

592
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:54,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I would guess that I have been listening since episode 50 or so.

593
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And for a dial-up station, that was really good stream.

594
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,436
[SPEAKER_07]: That back in the day we were.

595
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:01,138
[SPEAKER_07]: 7.

596
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:01,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Revolution.

597
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:03,919
[SPEAKER_07]: After seeing it again, I say that it has already gotten old.

598
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,139
[SPEAKER_07]: They had eliminated two teams.

599
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:08,961
[SPEAKER_07]: The remaining three were doing new dance routines to the same techno dance beat as the first episode.

600
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:17,065
[SPEAKER_07]: What Dance Revolution needs is to allow teams to dance and choreograph songs from any of the DDR games and maybe, just maybe, let the Slumber Party girls cover a B4U track.

601
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:18,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's all for now.

602
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:20,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to call in if I can.

603
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:21,807
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, have a great episode 201.

604
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:25,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, wouldn't this be like the fifth season of OLR Live?

605
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:29,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Rob, I am used to that we can plan out SkyCon in October.

606
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:30,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still looking forward to that.

607
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:34,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we kind of dropped the whole distinguishing seasons thing.

608
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:47,197
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you that behind the scenes we've been trying to iron out a new website, and probably with that will come some very superficial type changes when it comes to art and logos and things of that nature.

609
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:51,259
[SPEAKER_14]: But that won't be until probably the end of the year, going on into 2007.

610
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,101
[SPEAKER_14]: But we know our website is not the best website.

611
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:55,958
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

612
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:26,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell XM to pick us up.

613
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:28,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's it for email.

614
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:29,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

615
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you, emailers.

616
00:42:31,774 --> 00:42:32,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Send us more.

617
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at Orangelandradio.com.

618
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:34,735
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys rock.

619
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:35,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll let Rob read it all.

620
00:42:38,296 --> 00:42:43,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's some pretty cool stuff coming out from Tokyo Game Show from Namco Bandai.

621
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:50,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's about this game that used to be called Trusty Bell, or at least it's Trusty Bell in Japan.

622
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:53,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's coming over here as Eternal Sonata, which...

623
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:56,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty cool looking RPG.

624
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't this the one where you're in Chopin's mind or something like that?

625
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:00,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

626
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh god, that game looks weird, but cool.

627
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:06,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so we'll be seeing that probably next year at some point.

628
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:08,555
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kind of glad they're having the faith to port that over.

629
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:11,657
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would like more information on Blue Dragon US port, please.

630
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:12,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thanks.

631
00:43:13,078 --> 00:43:14,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a remake of Blue Dragon.

632
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,941
[SPEAKER_14]: How is Blue Dragon nowhere in our show world tonight?

633
00:43:17,021 --> 00:43:19,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I want to say something about Blue Dragon then, right now.

634
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:26,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, there were lines like 90 minutes long to see Blue Dragon over at the Tokyo Game Show, which isn't a surprise.

635
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:29,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it is a surprise when you consider it's an Xbox 360 game and this is Japan.

636
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:38,756
[SPEAKER_14]: But when you consider that, you know, remember when it was big, you know, turn heads that some of the people behind Final Fantasy had gone over to the Xbox side?

637
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:40,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is the game.

638
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:41,678
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is the big game.

639
00:43:42,058 --> 00:43:44,300
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll tell you what, from the previews I saw, it looks pretty hot.

640
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,641
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to play it, so...

641
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:47,977
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:23,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft has said that they are going to waive the cost of repairs on Xbox 360 consoles that were manufactured before January 1st, 2006 and refund any fees already paid.

643
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:33,074
[SPEAKER_07]: They were basically doing an analysis of the repair and basically it was the initial manufacturing run of the machine.

644
00:44:33,094 --> 00:44:34,735
[SPEAKER_07]: They've determined where a lot of problems are.

645
00:44:35,202 --> 00:44:37,244
[SPEAKER_07]: and they keep having them come in from that.

646
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:40,686
[SPEAKER_07]: They said that it was a higher rate than what they are happy with.

647
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:48,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've decided to comp repairs for any of the consoles manufactured before January 1st, 2006 and do those refunds.

648
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:54,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say you probably have to contact Microsoft Technical Support.

649
00:44:56,259 --> 00:45:02,003
[SPEAKER_07]: They did actually, though, say that they've rejected claims of an unusually high hardware failure rate.

650
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:02,364
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

651
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:11,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, good for Microsoft for doing the right thing with this, I think, because I think to charge somebody for these broken systems just because their 90-day warranty was up was kind of mean.

652
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:14,484
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the window needs to be extended a little bit.

653
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:18,346
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought my Xbox 360 in February, and that thing broke right away.

654
00:45:18,686 --> 00:45:22,828
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would be pissed if I was right on the bubble there January, February, and mine broke.

655
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:26,090
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's obvious that there were still some production problems into the earlier year.

656
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, Microsoft, for taking a step in the right direction.

657
00:45:30,073 --> 00:45:30,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Now take one more.

658
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:33,154
[SPEAKER_14]: In my opinion, they need to.

659
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:40,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, quick story, kind of relating to Xbox 360.

660
00:45:41,396 --> 00:45:53,778
[SPEAKER_14]: The official Xbox magazine ran a promo from Circuit City, and Circuit City was giving away this coupon that said that they were going to be offering 15% off of 99 Nights and Gears of War.

661
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:58,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, pretty cool, except for the fact that the coupon was set to expire October 31st.

662
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:06,906
[SPEAKER_14]: So while you could get 15% off 99 nights, that thing won't do you a damn bit of good when it comes to Gears of War because Gears of War is not coming out until November.

663
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:10,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just so you know, a clarification has arrived.

664
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:16,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And this, by the way, didn't make Circus City look good because there was that whole story a couple weeks ago about the one in San Diego that was offering to

665
00:46:17,216 --> 00:46:20,397
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, install the backwards compatibility on your Xbox for a fee.

666
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised it wasn't the best buy.

667
00:46:21,937 --> 00:46:23,057
[SPEAKER_13]: That was so messed up.

668
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:26,798
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, so Circuit City, ooh, really having to dig themselves out a hole.

669
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:27,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And they are.

670
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:35,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Official Xbox Magazine sent something out that said Circuit City is aware that the coupon in the November issue is messed up.

671
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:45,702
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to publish another coupon in the next issue of Official Xbox Magazine that will extend the promotion through the end of November, I believe it was.

672
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:46,322
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

673
00:46:47,301 --> 00:46:48,321
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool, Elise.

674
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:49,822
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice of them.

675
00:46:49,982 --> 00:46:55,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, speaking of nice of people to do something for us, SNK finally got their head out of their butt.

676
00:46:56,243 --> 00:47:01,045
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to be getting a new King of Fighters with a complete visual overhaul.

677
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:02,765
[SPEAKER_07]: New sprites.

678
00:47:03,545 --> 00:47:04,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally.

679
00:47:04,525 --> 00:47:08,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember sitting back and playing, like, what is it, KOF 2001.

680
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:10,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the same old Kyo.

681
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:13,448
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Kula, you know, with everything.

682
00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:14,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, no.

683
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:25,030
[SPEAKER_07]: They finally have listened to us, and there actually is speculation that it's going to be high-res sprites like in the Guilty Gear series.

684
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:34,276
[SPEAKER_07]: We can only hope that certain other publishers of ongoing 2D fighting series listen to us.

685
00:47:34,756 --> 00:47:36,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom, please.

686
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:42,522
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of hot that finally King of Fighters is getting some new sprites, because...

687
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:47,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki likes to bitch on every episode, and I'll admit I've done it too.

688
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:52,460
[SPEAKER_14]: With some of these games like Metal Slug and King of Fighters, they have not changed the graphics one damn bit in the past ten years.

689
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,541
[SPEAKER_14]: So someone at SNK has been listening.

690
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:55,681
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I would like to see?

691
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:59,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see the KOF series get the Street Fighter 3 treatment.

692
00:48:01,303 --> 00:48:03,624
[SPEAKER_07]: With the extra animations and...

693
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:05,863
[SPEAKER_02]: All that.

694
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:07,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the thing about Metal Slug, actually.

695
00:48:07,964 --> 00:48:13,446
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things they announced this week was that the Metal Slug Anthology is going to be including Metal Slug 6 as well.

696
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:15,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And will it have new graphics?

697
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

698
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:22,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has Metal Slug 6.

699
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:26,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's got to be different than Metal Slug 5 or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1.

700
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:28,176
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.

701
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:31,738
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a good game, and getting six of them at one price is not going to be a bad deal.

702
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:39,562
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think if they're going to make another standalone one, you might want to up the graphics to the new... Please don't hear me wrong.

703
00:48:39,622 --> 00:48:43,945
[SPEAKER_14]: A game doesn't have to have the greatest graphics in the world to be a good game.

704
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:49,828
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, if the technology's there, is it that hard?

705
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,170
[SPEAKER_14]: to change it and make it a little nicer looking?

706
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:53,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

707
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not expecting to be blown away.

708
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:58,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need Halo 3, Gears of War-style graphics.

709
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:11,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want, you know... Well, I even remember back in the day when Mugen was having its big day, there were actually people going in and retouching a lot of sprites from old games and making completely new fighters with the Mugen engine.

710
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:14,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

711
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:17,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of weird that, you know,

712
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:19,554
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

713
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:47,103
[SPEAKER_02]: because apparently they're having trouble with it.

714
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:56,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only listed as about 50% complete right now at Tokyo Game Show, and it's not very good, seeing as it's supposed to be released in a few months.

715
00:49:57,525 --> 00:49:58,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

716
00:49:58,805 --> 00:49:59,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

717
00:49:59,885 --> 00:50:00,726
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's official.

718
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:02,086
[SPEAKER_14]: They've delayed it until 2007.

719
00:50:02,386 --> 00:50:10,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and this has actually been confirmed by a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan fact sheet that it's confirmed as a summer 2007 release.

720
00:50:12,264 --> 00:50:18,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, with that out of the way, you know, I guess there are only, there's not a lot of launch titles.

721
00:50:18,988 --> 00:50:22,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, at least you're getting Ridge Racer 7, which does look pretty hot.

722
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer 7 is 100% complete, so yeah, you will be getting that launch.

723
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:35,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and actually, that's one of the first titles that's actually being released, you know, because they usually release titles before the console launches, and that's actually one of the first ones that come out.

724
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:37,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Namco.

725
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job.

726
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:46,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you might have heard during this week some dates get announced before they were supposed to, among other things, from Ubisoft.

727
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:59,037
[SPEAKER_14]: That's because somebody found a 2GB archive file on the FTP server that had information, video, artwork, and screens from all the upcoming roster of Ubisoft titles.

728
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:00,138
Whoops!

729
00:51:01,148 --> 00:51:15,383
[SPEAKER_14]: meaning that they discovered Far Cry Wii, Lost, Naruto, Open Season, Rainbow Six Vegas, Splinter Cell 4, Surf's Up, Shaun White Snowboarding, Star Wars Lethal Alliance on PSP, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Assassin's Creed.

730
00:51:16,023 --> 00:51:19,707
[SPEAKER_14]: There were also some previously unannounced games that were in this RAR file.

731
00:51:20,027 --> 00:51:24,792
[SPEAKER_14]: A brand new Prince of Persia, which seems to be something we've actually mentioned on this program previously,

732
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,853
[SPEAKER_14]: and Splinter Cell Games and Far Cry and Rocky on the PSP.

733
00:51:28,913 --> 00:51:31,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's so funny because I thought Rocky had already been announced.

734
00:51:31,836 --> 00:51:34,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had actually a sell sheet for Rocky for about a couple weeks.

735
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know there was an announce.

736
00:51:38,204 --> 00:51:39,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for me to keep track.

737
00:51:39,686 --> 00:51:39,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

738
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:41,628
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Rocky's coming out.

739
00:51:42,089 --> 00:51:42,309
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

740
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:51,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, now that was a very interesting find on the internet, and DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down to make interesting finds of her own.

741
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:53,082
[SPEAKER_14]: And she'll share them with you each and every week.

742
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,263
[SPEAKER_14]: I sure will!

743
00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:57,045
[SPEAKER_14]: In this segment called the Website of the Week.

744
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:04,550
[SPEAKER_14]: And no, it's not the Arcade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

745
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:36,131
[SPEAKER_07]: My website of the week is actually an official website and anyone who's been reading my live journal and listening to me go into fangasms over this the website of the week is the official Doctor Who website on the BBC website because I love Doctor Who if you go to bbc.co.uk slash Doctor Who you will go to the fantastic site where there's lots of wallpaper with David Tennant all over it and Billy Piper all over it

746
00:52:37,111 --> 00:53:05,116
[SPEAKER_07]: and K9 and Sarah Jane and everybody and downloadable mobile phone stuff and it's actually better than just about any of the fan sites I've seen and there is even a link to the classic series too with a what is the TARDIS tutorial as someone who has grown up with Doctor Who as a constant squee fangasm fangirl yep, I'm proud of it

747
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:12,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who

748
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:38,952
[SPEAKER_14]: and Torino.

749
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:51,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Calling them the Xbox Killers makes them sound like they go into people's houses at night like ninjas and cut the cords from the Xbox and smash it with a hammer while everyone's sleeping and then leaves the house silently.

750
00:53:51,904 --> 00:53:56,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyways, they were sentenced to death.

751
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, apparently they murdered six people in 2004 and...

752
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:06,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now they're dead.

753
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:07,266
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly did they do?

754
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:09,327
[SPEAKER_02]: They murdered them over an Xbox, or what?

755
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:13,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what they assumed, because I guess, you know, they stole an Xbox.

756
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:22,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the murders were vicious, blood being found on the floors and ceilings and the walls, and the victims were not only bludgeoned to death, but were mutilated afterwards.

757
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:33,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, you know, basically, you know, the killer... Oh, never mind, that's another story where they're talking about that person who killed their...

758
00:54:35,242 --> 00:54:37,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Child over the Xbox thing too.

759
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people causing violence over an Xbox.

760
00:54:41,705 --> 00:54:42,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

761
00:54:42,325 --> 00:54:48,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Wii will be so easily accessible to this kind of stuff.

762
00:54:48,647 --> 00:54:55,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you get those third party controllers or something in shape like a samurai sword or actually a samurai sword.

763
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that'd be cool.

764
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:57,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Samurai sword.

765
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:00,072
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kill people.

766
00:55:00,412 --> 00:55:00,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Or hookers.

767
00:55:01,652 --> 00:55:03,193
[SPEAKER_14]: You're just waiting for that with the Wii, aren't you?

768
00:55:04,454 --> 00:55:04,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

769
00:55:04,874 --> 00:55:05,155
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

770
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:10,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that's just about going to wrap it up for news tonight.

771
00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:12,700
[SPEAKER_14]: So that means it's time for us to take your Skype calls.

[SPEAKER_14]: I can say, however, we are looking into our ever-awesome webmaster, Jason, is looking into some toll-free options for us.

777
00:55:32,213 --> 00:55:34,234
[SPEAKER_14]: There may be something coming in the very near future.

778
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:36,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't that make a lot of you folks very happy?

779
00:55:36,963 --> 00:55:38,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to the phones.

780
00:55:38,644 --> 00:55:39,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

781
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:40,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

782
00:55:40,806 --> 00:55:41,526
[SPEAKER_14]: RavensDolphin.

783
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:42,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, RavensDolphin.

784
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,208
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind, buddy?

785
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:46,270
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that Xbox serial killer?

786
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:46,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

787
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:53,295
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of this episode of the Boondocks when we were like, we gotta find the Xbox killer.

788
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to find him.

789
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:56,658
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to set that up for me a little bit.

790
00:55:56,678 --> 00:55:58,900
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to pardon my ignorance, but I don't watch a whole lot of TV.

791
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,241
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's the show about?

792
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:02,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, is that the cartoon one that's...

793
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's on Adult Swim.

794
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:06,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I've seen a clip of it.

795
00:56:07,361 --> 00:56:17,648
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, the show is a suburban... These are African-Americans that is out of their unit, and they go to, like, suburban life, and see Huey and Dewey, and they go on adventures.

796
00:56:17,928 --> 00:56:25,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And this episode involved a guy going to jail because he got murdered over an Xbox, and he went like, They're gonna raid me!

797
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:25,914
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna raid me!

798
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:26,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta do something!

799
00:56:26,995 --> 00:56:27,815
[SPEAKER_04]: He went like, hold on.

800
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:31,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Was this before or after the real-life Xbox killer?

801
00:56:32,218 --> 00:56:32,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, before.

802
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Way before.

803
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:34,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

804
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

805
00:56:35,301 --> 00:56:35,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

806
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:41,029
[SPEAKER_14]: So is it possible that this show, maybe this person should be called the Boondocks Killer?

807
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:44,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, because that's what makes me laugh about it.

808
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:46,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh God, this reminds me of that episode.

809
00:56:47,813 --> 00:56:50,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting reality mirroring fiction.

810
00:56:50,954 --> 00:56:51,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of sad, though.

811
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Regardless of what inspired it, these people should have known better.

812
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:56,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

813
00:56:57,778 --> 00:56:58,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

814
00:56:58,938 --> 00:56:59,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else on your mind, my friend?

815
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:01,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Two more things.

816
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:01,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

817
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a bone to pick with you, Sky.

818
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:04,501
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

819
00:57:05,584 --> 00:57:10,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time when I talked to you about a DS Lite, you said run it over with a car and I would get a black one.

820
00:57:11,706 --> 00:57:12,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I did?

821
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:14,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably did.

822
00:57:15,187 --> 00:57:17,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you said buy the warranty and run it over with a car.

823
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:20,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait, I don't think I said that.

824
00:57:20,049 --> 00:57:22,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Miklatov said it.

825
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:23,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I did.

826
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:24,130
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

827
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:24,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

828
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:28,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever who said it, I still had to pay 50 bucks for the black one.

829
00:57:29,672 --> 00:57:31,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you seriously go and run over it with a car?

830
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:35,345
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank God it had a hairline fracture.

831
00:57:35,825 --> 00:57:36,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

832
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, oh my God, please don't tell me you actually went and ran over with a car.

833
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:41,730
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I would be sad.

834
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see someone who did that.

835
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:46,454
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Walmart's return policy might let you do that.

836
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:50,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Walmart, you can return anything at Walmart.

837
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:51,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter if it's there.

838
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody in chat had brought that up earlier, so it just made me think of that.

839
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:58,144
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole Walmart return policy is so liberal.

840
00:57:59,486 --> 00:57:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

841
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:00,967
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the other thing?

842
00:58:02,386 --> 00:58:04,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hold Christmas to a high regard?

843
00:58:04,588 --> 00:58:09,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I listen to Orange Lounge Radio for a year, it feels like Christmas is nothing, just another day.

844
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:13,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I hold Boxing Day in high regard.

845
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:20,319
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I'll tell you what, in my personal family life, we don't have the whole big deal Christmas thing.

846
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:23,201
[SPEAKER_14]: We will do something on Christmas morning, but that's about it.

847
00:58:23,341 --> 00:58:25,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's no children really in the family.

848
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:28,905
[SPEAKER_14]: We're kind of a small family unit, so it's not the big deal it is for some families.

849
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:34,390
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, are you going to require an Elvira Pinball game?

850
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I love that game on the Atari Lynx.

851
00:58:37,491 --> 00:58:38,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I own that.

852
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:40,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Elvira Pinball.

853
00:58:40,592 --> 00:58:41,493
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be hot.

854
00:58:41,553 --> 00:58:42,313
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to do that.

855
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:45,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Make that happen.

856
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:48,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen an Elvira Pinball recently because I know some people who own one.

857
00:58:48,915 --> 00:58:51,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that the one that had the lower playing field?

858
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:54,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been so long, Dark.

859
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:54,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

860
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe, because I've seen one.

861
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:58,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see an Elvira pinball.

862
00:58:58,562 --> 00:59:04,985
[SPEAKER_07]: The place that we got our last action hero from, I think, had an Elvira pinball in their little repair place.

863
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,727
[SPEAKER_14]: The last time I saw an Elvira machine was in Chico, where I went to school.

864
00:59:10,268 --> 00:59:16,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, next on our list is actually a Doctor Who pinball machine for me and a Medieval Madness.

865
00:59:17,364 --> 00:59:19,226
[SPEAKER_04]: What about... I know this is so random.

866
00:59:19,266 --> 00:59:21,348
[SPEAKER_04]: What about an Austin Power one?

867
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:23,590
[SPEAKER_04]: That one holds fond memories with me, too.

868
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:24,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun one.

869
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:25,751
[SPEAKER_07]: One I wouldn't mind.

870
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:30,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I actually found... Dan found a place in town that has a Pirates of the Caribbean machine.

871
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:31,877
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the new Stern machines.

872
00:59:32,457 --> 00:59:33,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play that.

873
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:34,819
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $4,000, though.

874
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have that.

875
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:36,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

876
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:39,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can only get them new.

877
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:51,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, from what I understand, the licensing to put out some of the prototype machines that Capcom had out, like Big Bang Bar, from what I understand, I think Stern acquired the licensing to release those now.

878
00:59:51,553 --> 00:59:52,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to find that out for sure.

879
00:59:53,735 --> 00:59:54,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, would you?

880
00:59:55,636 --> 00:59:56,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

881
00:59:56,116 --> 00:59:58,017
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I find that out, I'll make it public knowledge.

882
00:59:58,958 --> 00:59:59,218
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

883
00:59:59,398 --> 01:00:00,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Let's Party.

884
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,379
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a great staple.

885
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:02,740
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

886
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,982
[SPEAKER_14]: As much as I'd love to reminisce about pinball all night, we've got other calls we've got to get to.

887
01:00:07,163 --> 01:00:07,423
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

888
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:08,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Raven's Dolphin.

889
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:10,871
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

890
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:11,271
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

891
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:11,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good night.

892
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:12,651
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

893
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:12,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

894
01:00:12,871 --> 01:00:13,151
[SPEAKER_14]: See ya.

895
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:14,632
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

896
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to another call.

897
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

898
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:17,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

899
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:19,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is Anoush.

900
01:00:19,553 --> 01:00:20,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Anoush.

901
01:00:20,093 --> 01:00:20,713
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

902
01:00:21,514 --> 01:00:29,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I was just wondering if you guys heard about that software update that Microsoft's going to release for the 360 that's going to

903
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:30,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Output 1080p

904
01:00:52,463 --> 01:00:54,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, aren't they going to upscale movies or something?

905
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:58,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Movies and stuff will be upscaled, and games will be upscaled to 1080p.

906
01:00:58,387 --> 01:01:00,928
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do 1080p with a VGA cable.

907
01:01:01,388 --> 01:01:07,852
[SPEAKER_14]: But now Sony's come back and kind of poo-pooing that statement going, oh, but it's not native 1080, they're just upscaling things.

908
01:01:08,092 --> 01:01:13,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but if games are programmed to 1080p, they will play it natively at 1080p.

909
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:14,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

910
01:01:15,176 --> 01:01:18,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're saying, oh, they're not natively 1080p.

911
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:21,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, neither are some of your games, so shut the hell up.

912
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:25,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Anush, I'll ask you, what do you think about the news?

913
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:32,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't really make sense to me, because wouldn't they put some kind of digital output on it, like HDMI?

914
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:37,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, technically, can't components handle 1080p?

915
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,971
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not as... I mean, I don't know enough about video specs.

916
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:42,812
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need HDMI to do 1080p.

917
01:01:43,273 --> 01:01:46,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, HDMI is going to be required when they digitally sign...

918
01:01:47,426 --> 01:01:51,989
[SPEAKER_02]: when the broadcast flag goes into effect in a few years.

919
01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:54,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do I need HDMI over component?

920
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:57,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just that much clearer of a picture like component over S-video?

921
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.

922
01:01:59,114 --> 01:02:01,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I'm not sure.

923
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:04,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if component can do 1080p.

924
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:05,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it can.

925
01:02:05,158 --> 01:02:06,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to read up on Wikipedia.

926
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:15,284
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know HDMI, though, the big thing, and I think this is kind of one of the reasons why they added it to the lower-end PS3 model, too, is so that they can

927
01:02:15,908 --> 01:02:24,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Support the broadcast flag for the movies and stuff, because otherwise, in 2009 or whenever this broadcast flag goes into effect...

928
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:31,009
[SPEAKER_02]: All your movies are going to be dropped down to 540p and that's the highest they will go if you're watching Blu-ray.

929
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:33,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Jeremy Todd 1 has an interesting comment in chat.

930
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:37,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sick of all this 1080p versus 1080i bullshit.

931
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,611
[SPEAKER_14]: 95% of people won't even be able to tell the difference between the two.

932
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:41,252
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just an e-penis sort of thing.

933
01:02:41,332 --> 01:02:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

934
01:02:41,972 --> 01:02:48,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you're not going to notice the difference unless you have a TV that's over like 48 inches and you're sitting 6 feet away.

935
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Anoush, do you own any next-gen systems yet?

936
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:55,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you planning on purchasing any of them?

937
01:02:56,824 --> 01:02:59,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think I might go for a Wii and a PS3.

938
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:06,553
[SPEAKER_14]: A Wii and a PS3, so this doesn't sway you, being somebody who wants to get a PS3, this doesn't sway you in Xbox's direction any?

939
01:03:07,974 --> 01:03:09,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of swore not to get an Xbox.

940
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:10,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, why's this?

941
01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:14,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally against Microsoft.

942
01:03:14,984 --> 01:03:15,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay.

943
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:31,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I know a lot of people who are in that camp, they just really don't want to... You know, I used to be in that camp too, but I gotta say, there were just... Some of the games towards the end of the first Xbox run really finally convinced me that I needed to check it out, and I've been pretty happy with it.

944
01:03:31,618 --> 01:03:32,278
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I say.

945
01:03:32,298 --> 01:03:35,841
[SPEAKER_07]: The system is only as good as the games that are on it.

946
01:03:36,201 --> 01:03:40,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me guess, Anoush, are you a role-playing type fan?

947
01:03:40,085 --> 01:03:42,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, those are your types of games, the games that Microsoft kind of lacks on?

948
01:03:43,873 --> 01:03:44,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

949
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:48,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more into racing games and FPS.

950
01:03:48,514 --> 01:03:48,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

951
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:53,816
[SPEAKER_14]: And you still don't like Xbox 360 because that's pretty much all they have right now.

952
01:03:54,216 --> 01:03:55,156
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

953
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:56,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, interesting.

954
01:03:56,377 --> 01:03:58,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, you're free to like what you like.

955
01:03:58,717 --> 01:03:59,417
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no problem.

956
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:04,899
[SPEAKER_14]: But I was just kind of curious on your thoughts on how 1080p might sway your thoughts on that one way or the other.

957
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:08,560
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't really the 1080p that makes me want the PS3.

958
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a fanboy thing.

959
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:12,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay, so...

960
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's funny.

961
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,171
[SPEAKER_14]: What games are you looking forward to on PS3?

962
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:18,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Gran Turismo HD.

963
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:22,834
[SPEAKER_06]: From what you guys said, I'm kind of swaying against that now.

964
01:04:22,854 --> 01:04:26,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I was going to say, what does this whole microtransactions thing do to your opinion on that?

965
01:04:30,397 --> 01:04:34,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of thinking that maybe Sony will give you a points card with the game.

966
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:35,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

967
01:04:36,779 --> 01:04:38,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can download whatever you like.

968
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:40,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Like so many points.

969
01:04:40,982 --> 01:04:41,442
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

970
01:04:41,742 --> 01:04:46,043
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking about Wii 60 was this big thing.

971
01:04:46,063 --> 01:04:47,143
[SPEAKER_14]: People were going to get the Wii 60.

972
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:48,204
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I missed it.

973
01:04:48,224 --> 01:04:50,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Gohan in chat is saying it should be Wii S3.

974
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:52,525
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're in the Wii S3 camp.

975
01:04:53,485 --> 01:04:54,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess so.

976
01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:54,806
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

977
01:04:54,906 --> 01:04:55,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds good.

978
01:04:55,346 --> 01:04:57,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Go register WiiS3.com before someone else does.

979
01:04:58,427 --> 01:04:58,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

980
01:04:58,767 --> 01:04:59,307
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Anush.

981
01:04:59,367 --> 01:04:59,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care.

982
01:05:00,387 --> 01:05:00,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you too.

983
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:01,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye-bye.

984
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:03,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

985
01:05:03,268 --> 01:05:04,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to another call.

986
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:05,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to this call.

987
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

988
01:05:07,596 --> 01:05:08,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy crap, you scared the crap out of me, it's DMN.

989
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:08,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Boo!

990
01:05:08,897 --> 01:05:09,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, DMN!

991
01:05:09,057 --> 01:05:09,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah!

992
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:09,817
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

993
01:05:10,018 --> 01:05:12,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, actually something you guys haven't talked about today.

994
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:13,300
[SPEAKER_14]: His skull is on his mind.

995
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:45,525
[SPEAKER_09]: The totally unprofessional comments about Sony calling the Xbox 360's HD DVD drive quote-unquote unfortunate.

996
01:05:47,086 --> 01:06:00,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the link to the article handy, but basically Sony said your HD DVD drive sucks and we're better in a very unprofessional sort of way, yet very businesslike.

997
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:03,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's just waving their cocks around, I mean...

998
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:13,745
[SPEAKER_14]: The marketplace will choose the ultimate victor and then I believe bragging rights can be bestowed.

999
01:06:13,785 --> 01:06:17,968
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, it's just they're talking trash because they're trying to talk their own thing up because it's coming out soon.

1000
01:06:19,068 --> 01:06:19,549
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't know.

1001
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.

1002
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:31,556
[SPEAKER_14]: My friend and I went into a Best Buy this week and finally, after all this time, I got to see an HD DVD and a Blu-ray side by side.

1003
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:32,897
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll tell you what.

1004
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:35,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to say I think the Blu-ray did look a little better.

1005
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:52,596
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are some other factors to take into consideration here because, you know, my friend who is with me, David, said, you know, the other TV is kind of crappy and plus they're playing Ultraviolet on the Blu-ray, which is, you know, a movie as crappy as the movie is, I'm sure, is meant to look very stylish and cool.

1006
01:06:52,877 --> 01:06:58,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas over here you're getting like the Manchurian Candidate or something that's not really, you know, action-packed.

1007
01:06:58,842 --> 01:06:59,903
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

1008
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:06,469
[SPEAKER_14]: But my first impression did tell me that, you know what, Blu-ray was a little prettier.

1009
01:07:06,529 --> 01:07:08,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Blu-ray is a little prettier, but a little pricier.

1010
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:14,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, HD DVD players, I think, run at the cheapest around $500, whereas Blu-rays are like $1,000.

1011
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:17,694
[SPEAKER_14]: This is beta versus VHS all over again.

1012
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:18,575
[SPEAKER_14]: All over again.

1013
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:25,978
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I read somewhere, and I think we had to cut it from our show roll, but Loki, maybe you'd remember this, because I think you were the one that posted it in our super secret thread.

1014
01:07:26,759 --> 01:07:27,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Something about...

1015
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:31,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Some company was going to be making discs that did both HD, DVD, and Blu-ray.

1016
01:07:32,065 --> 01:07:33,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Warner.

1017
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:36,206
[SPEAKER_02]: They patented technology, I guess.

1018
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:39,127
[SPEAKER_02]: It's DVD, Blu-ray, and HD all in one.

1019
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:40,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart.

1020
01:07:41,888 --> 01:07:43,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And I imagine they're going to use it for their movies.

1021
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:44,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart.

1022
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:49,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter what format it goes, they're supporting it.

1023
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great idea.

1024
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:51,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1025
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish this whole format war thing would end and just come up with something.

1026
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

1027
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:56,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to say, DMN?

1028
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:59,296
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cutting out there, my friend.

1029
01:07:59,656 --> 01:08:00,096
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1030
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:01,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was rubbing my face.

1031
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:26,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I just posted a link in the chatroom if anybody wants to take a look at that.

1032
01:08:26,794 --> 01:08:27,334
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?

1033
01:08:28,936 --> 01:08:30,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamespot.something.

1034
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:30,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

1035
01:08:31,618 --> 01:08:33,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I know, but what is it that I'm going to look at if I pull this up?

1036
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:38,325
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the article regarding Sony talking their shit.

1037
01:08:40,107 --> 01:08:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is close to launch.

1038
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:42,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't want to whip it out?

1039
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:50,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave Karacker, Senior Director of Corporate Communications for Sony Computer Entertainment America

1040
01:08:58,374 --> 01:09:04,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony realizes that to truly take gaming into the next generation requires a larger data format for both games and movies.

1041
01:09:04,878 --> 01:09:15,386
[SPEAKER_14]: PS3 uses the Blu-ray format for gaming, giving developers 50GB of high-definition storage on a single disc, while Microsoft's 9GB DVD gaming format is an obstacle for storing HD content.

1042
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:17,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like typical cock-waving to me.

1043
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:20,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's not like he said, God, the 360's a piece of shit.

1044
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:22,752
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

1045
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,554
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more the point and laugh tactic.

1046
01:09:24,754 --> 01:09:31,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is just more trying to emphasize what's good about theirs and how it outshines the other one.

1047
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:33,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1048
01:09:34,302 --> 01:09:35,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was about it.

1049
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:36,864
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys have a good night.

1050
01:09:37,024 --> 01:09:37,805
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, you too, buddy.

1051
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:38,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for the topic.

1052
01:09:39,126 --> 01:09:39,746
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, bye-bye.

1053
01:09:39,786 --> 01:09:40,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

1054
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:43,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, callers are calling in with lots of good things we should have been thinking about earlier.

1055
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do one more call.

1056
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:48,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I know some other folks are trying to get through, but we've got to wrap it up here pretty soon.

1057
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:49,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

1058
01:09:50,015 --> 01:09:50,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1059
01:09:51,723 --> 01:09:53,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're a little bit quiet.

1060
01:09:53,624 --> 01:09:56,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Try to get a little closer to your mic if you can and tell us what's on your mind.

1061
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, my mic's a little quiet.

1062
01:09:59,986 --> 01:10:01,887
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

1063
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:02,207
[SPEAKER_14]: 24, the game.

1064
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:04,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, 24, the game.

1065
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:04,688
[SPEAKER_14]: What about it?

1066
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:06,628
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty good.

1067
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:09,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this something you just picked up this week?

1068
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,410
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I won it.

1069
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:13,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right.

1070
01:10:14,431 --> 01:10:16,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, it's a pretty good game?

1071
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:20,445
[SPEAKER_08]: The game's okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good.

1072
01:10:20,905 --> 01:10:21,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah?

1073
01:10:21,325 --> 01:10:22,785
[SPEAKER_14]: How is it if you're a fan of the show?

1074
01:10:24,145 --> 01:10:26,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, if you're a fan of the show, you definitely gotta try it.

1075
01:10:26,866 --> 01:10:28,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah?

1076
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:30,647
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of game is it?

1077
01:10:30,687 --> 01:10:34,307
[SPEAKER_14]: For those that don't know what to expect out of 24, the game, what kind of game could you compare it to?

1078
01:10:36,048 --> 01:10:37,228
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a third-person shooter.

1079
01:10:37,368 --> 01:10:40,149
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a few mini-games in it, and there's some really crappy driving in it.

1080
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:42,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Really crappy driving in it?

1081
01:10:43,129 --> 01:10:46,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's the worst driving I've ever played, but the rest of it's pretty good.

1082
01:10:47,392 --> 01:10:48,313
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, awesome.

1083
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:51,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm glad you've had a chance to check that out.

1084
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:55,496
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a little bit quiet, so I've got to keep this short, but is there anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1085
01:10:58,138 --> 01:10:58,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Not really.

1086
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:00,379
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, have a good one and enjoy the game.

1087
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:01,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, see you.

1088
01:11:01,879 --> 01:11:02,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

1089
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Little mini game review there on the Skype line.

1090
01:11:05,822 --> 01:11:06,502
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it's for.

1091
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:09,163
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys can call in and tell us your thoughts on things.

1092
01:11:09,543 --> 01:11:10,164
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate it.

1093
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:11,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.

1094
01:11:12,405 --> 01:11:13,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll have to try again next week.

1095
01:11:13,605 --> 01:11:14,166
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

1096
01:11:14,786 --> 01:11:16,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other last-minute stories here in studio?

1097
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:19,524
[SPEAKER_07]: In other news, I'm still awesome.

1098
01:11:22,627 --> 01:11:24,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Was anyone ever questioning that, DarkSakura?

1099
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,152
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just have to keep, you know, making a mention.

1100
01:11:29,354 --> 01:11:31,075
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you disagree, send us an email.

1101
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:33,017
[SPEAKER_07]: If you disagree, keep it to yourself.

1102
01:11:34,418 --> 01:11:34,699
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1103
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything from you, Loki?

1104
01:11:37,301 --> 01:11:37,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1105
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think.

1106
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there was some other stuff I had.

1107
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:44,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking real quick here because I shut down my list because I suck.

1108
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:47,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think here.

1109
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:51,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1110
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Great radio.

1111
01:11:53,381 --> 01:11:55,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think we might have to wrap it up if you don't have anything.

1112
01:11:56,003 --> 01:11:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.

1113
01:11:58,445 --> 01:11:59,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a couple of small things.

1114
01:11:59,906 --> 01:12:02,287
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a couple of stories.

1115
01:12:02,508 --> 01:12:05,890
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, no PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories coming out.

1116
01:12:07,054 --> 01:12:07,534
[SPEAKER_02]: None at all?

1117
01:12:07,794 --> 01:12:08,215
[SPEAKER_02]: None at all.

1118
01:12:08,315 --> 01:12:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1119
01:12:36,236 --> 01:12:59,280
[SPEAKER_02]: which is interesting and then what was the other one I was going to say oh yeah they're working on a new Metal Gear Solid digital comic based on Metal Gear Solid 2 in Japan so that would be pretty cool and what was the other one oh Square's working on Front Mission for the DS so that should be pretty neat hmm

1120
01:12:59,665 --> 01:13:01,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some news actually for our UK listeners.

1121
01:13:01,726 --> 01:13:02,626
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1122
01:13:02,706 --> 01:13:12,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone who is looking for Football Manager 2007, there's a demo being released on Sunday, 1st October for PC, Mac, and Intel Mac.

1123
01:13:15,532 --> 01:13:23,215
[SPEAKER_07]: To quote on here, the vanilla version will include English and Scottish quick starts, English language only, with limited assets, logo and player pictures, etc.,

1124
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:30,260
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be available from the News of the World website in conjunction with Play.com to try and maximize the bandwidth available.

1125
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:37,565
[SPEAKER_07]: The link to this will, of course, be on SIGames.com when it's released at midnight.

1126
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:45,711
[SPEAKER_07]: The Strawberry version, that's kind of funny, will include extra quick starts and extra languages to be confirmed with more assets.

1127
01:13:45,731 --> 01:13:47,973
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be available initially as a torrent only.

1128
01:13:48,413 --> 01:13:51,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Also at midnight from www.SIGames.com.

1129
01:13:52,536 --> 01:13:53,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if anyone's interested in that.

1130
01:13:54,893 --> 01:14:01,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of London or the UK listeners, there's actually going to be a London's Game Festival kicking off on October 2nd.

1131
01:14:02,459 --> 01:14:03,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs through the 7th.

1132
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be able to play tons of games.

1133
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:08,604
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long festival, five days.

1134
01:14:08,965 --> 01:14:14,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're going to be able to play tons of games at a special setup at Oxford Street's HMV.

1135
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:20,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus there's going to be various other events and venues and showcases going on around the same time.

1136
01:14:21,512 --> 01:14:26,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other fun things to note, at Tokyo Game Show they were showing off some different colored PSPs.

1137
01:14:28,175 --> 01:14:33,618
[SPEAKER_02]: One including a camo, as well as red, yellow, and green PSPs.

1138
01:14:34,799 --> 01:14:37,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I'm sorry, red, blue, and yellow PSPs.

1139
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,761
[SPEAKER_02]: All with metallic sheens to them.

1140
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And another fun one I thought of, Devil May Cry is being made into an anime.

1141
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:48,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

1142
01:14:49,506 --> 01:14:50,386
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be pretty cool.

1143
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:58,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, it's about time we wrap up this program for tonight and wait till next week for more gaming news.

1144
01:14:58,717 --> 01:15:01,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go around, though, first and get everyone's final thought.

1145
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Drew Nami, thanks again for being here as always.

1146
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:05,462
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your final thought?

1147
01:15:05,982 --> 01:15:06,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Food.

1148
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:07,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1149
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:08,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought?

1150
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:14,828
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is, and I forgot to mention, Unreal Tournament 2007 for the PlayStation 3 will support mods.

1151
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:16,729
