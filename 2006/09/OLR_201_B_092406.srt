00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 201 for this September the 24th of 2006.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we've got a case of the giggles, sorry about that, but that's part of our live segment that you can only hear when you listen to us live.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Sorry podcast fans, we have to do something special for the live listeners, whether it be here on orangeloungeradio.com or allgames.com.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Anyway, we're going to get back into the news now, however, and I'm going to start off this segment of news.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Last week we had a crap load of Wii news, and we have a wee bit of Wii news this week,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and one of them is a country launch we didn't get to last week,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but here at Orange Lounge Radio we want to recognize all the countries around the world that do gaming.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One of them is New Zealand.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
New Zealand has had their Wii launch date revealed and some of the details.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The console will be coming to New Zealand on December 7th.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Wii Sports will be a pack-in game, just like here in the US.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It will cost $499 New Zealand dollars, which translates to about 261 euros, 330 American dollars.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, by the way, New Zealand is actually having to pay a little bit more than Australia for that.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Doh. Doh.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But at least you're getting the console relatively early and not getting the shaft on release date,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
so, you know, at least that's some consolation, I hope?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I guess.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Does it just strike me funny that consolation is almost a pun?

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Consolation, yeah.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anyways, some of the news we actually talked about a while back was how the Wii wasn't going to have a digital audio out port,

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and we were wondering why that, you know, I think I made the point that that wasn't really important.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, in the case now, it really isn't important because we found out that only,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that we will only be supporting Dolby Pro Logic 2 technology.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, you know, you can just use your standard, you know, red and white audio cables for that kind of stuff.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I guess it's cool that it has some sort of quasi-surround sound to it.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I mean, not that it really needs too much since it has, you know, the speaker and the controller,

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which I guess that they could use for some semi-surround sound, but whatever.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I mean, it's not a surprise when the game isn't, you know, HD, you know, really anyways.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe it's just me, and let me go out here on a limb,

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and I'm sure to piss somebody off with this, you know, thing I'm about to say, but whatever.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's my view.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't really get all like, oh, gosh, the sound in this game was so crystal clear, amazing.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Wow, when I shot that guy in the face, I could really hear that in full, you know, 31.11 surround super uber Dolby sound or whatever.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Maybe that's just because I have a pretty shitty surround system in my house, like it's probably like 10 years old, it's old.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But I don't, like, I'm more big on what's the music and, you know, the stuff that you don't have to have the huge boom systems for.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't really need this kind of stuff to be fully immersed into the game anyways.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, I disagree.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, please.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
After having played games in surround sound?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, hell yeah, especially for anything that's scary where you, those little side noises are going to,

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
especially since you've got your speaker in the Wii controller, having that full surround sound.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, do you want to go see your movie in just mono, or do you want to see it in surround sound?

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, I mean, it depends.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If I'm watching a comedy, it doesn't really matter.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you have the capability to play it in surround sound, don't you want the full effect?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It is kind of weird, though, that it does have a, you know, a speaker in the controller, you know,

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
because they're trying to make it more kind of immersive, and yet they're not supporting, like, immersive sound.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know, I just, let me phrase it this way, I've just, I've never had a crappy sound system take the game experience away from me, I guess.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe I've just played the wrong games on those uber surround systems.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Like, I really haven't played a lot of survival horror on those systems, so maybe I'm just not playing the right games, I don't know.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It could be the game.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, if it isn't much of a surprise, of course, the same info came out this week that Dolby is also going to be providing the sound technology for the PlayStation 3,

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
including Dolby Digital's 5.1 surround, and you better believe that they're going to be pushing this crap.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sony will also be supporting Dolby's TrueHD sound for decoding up to 7.1 channels for playback of movie titles in the Blu-ray Disc format and probably games.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So, I think that's kind of interesting, you know, that they're supporting this technology.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They're probably going to be pushing those wonderful Sony 7.1 systems now so you can get your 7.1 system and your 1080p, you know, plasma screen TV and spend uber money on stuff that you probably don't need.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Screw that, if you want something good, get a Harman Kardon and Bose surround speakers.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No contest.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's what we've got in my house.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Anyway, something that actually is cool for some if you manage to get in on it and not so cool for others, Amazon has sold out of pre-orders for the Wii.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yep. No more.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So, go to your GameStop and wait until they do pre-orders.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, how long was that up? An hour? Two hours?

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We probably had to shut that off pretty quick.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It wasn't. It was about a couple of hours, and the reason why they stopped pre-orders is because they don't have their allocations yet.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They all know what they're getting, so they're going to restart pre-orders once they figure that out.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But it was kind of an error, I guess, on taking the pre-orders right now.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, I can tell you right now, at least as far as I've last asked, GameStop's not taking pre-orders on them yet.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, I've been calling them every day.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I ask my husband every day.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do they know you by name when you call them?

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, they don't, but I always preface the call with, I'm sorry to ask this, but, you know, because I'm sure they get to call like 700 calls.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't you think news will hit the internet when they're going to start taking pre-orders?

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, but I want to know first because I don't want to hear it from second hand because then people already know and they're already there.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'd rather call them right when they open up and say, hey, are you taking pre-orders?

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, I'll tell you this.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As soon as I find out when GameStop is taking pre-orders, we will have an announcement.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, as soon as I can actually say something.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You think we'll be able to beat some of the big boys to it? I don't know.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Maybe.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We'll see. All right.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
As soon as I hear all the drama that goes on.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, you should share some of that drama with us.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't share some of the drama.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Damn, what kind of radio is that?

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, one thing that's causing a little bit of drama, as you know, last week we talked about, oh, the Wii is region-free.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, it's not region-free.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's free. It's not free.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, it looks like there are plenty more votes for not region-free.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In fact, representatives from Nintendo of America confirmed to 1UP.com earlier this week that the Wii will be region-encoded by territory.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Wah, wah.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Which means, unfortunately, if you want to play Japanese Wii games, you will have to purchase a Japanese Wii or wait for a hack.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It will be there.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It will either be a physical one or something as simple as a disc.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because it seems to me that if this is like a last-minute decision by them, that it's going to be something half-assed for the region protection.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't see.

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I really don't see why they're putting so much effort into it since they've never really given half a crap before because it's always been something easy.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And, anyway, Nintendo, if you're listening, Reggie, if you're listening to our podcast, why?

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You know what?

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And here's evidence, if Nintendo is listening to this, here's evidence that region-free will work.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Elite Beat Agents, I will bet you anything that game sells like hotcakes.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why?

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because so many people purchased the import version and have let their friends play it that I bet that game is going to sell like crazy.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Wouldn't have happened if you didn't have the region-free DS.

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That wouldn't have happened.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I bet you Elite Beat Agents possibly wouldn't have even come out here.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It would make more sense to have the universal launch, have the same games come out except for the really crappy American-centered games and the really quirky Japanese-centered games.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I think that region coding is pretty much going to shoot them in the ass.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It hasn't worked yet.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's interesting because some folks in the chat room are saying, you know what?

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I still don't believe it.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You know, so what if this big, foofy website called their rep at Nintendo?

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Reps have been wrong before.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Interesting.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So I guess there is a little bit of hope that perhaps this system could possibly still be region-free.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I hope so.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Reggie, if you're listening, I love you, dude.

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Please make it region-free.

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't think, well, it would be nice, but I don't think they will.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't know.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We'll see.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But anyways, one thing I am hoping to see on the Wii would be Grand Theft Auto.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And now the news coming out that Take-Two is planning on bringing M-rated games to the Wii.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That makes me happy because what are they known for as far as, you know, big games?

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Cutesy, Ellabits, and Pokemon.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, no, no.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's Grand Theft Auto.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, wait.

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, I'm sorry.

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I thought you were talking about Nintendo.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Nintendo is usually known for the Cutesy games.

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There is nothing I want more in this world to be able to beat a hooker with a Wiimote.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That is going to be the...

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Beat me to it.

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I will be able to die after doing that.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I probably will.

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What they need to add is like, you know, the pimp slap with the Wiimote.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I mean, it will be just awesome.

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I cannot wait for, you know, them to actually put out something.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Although they're probably going to bring out fucking table tennis for the...

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hey, now wait a minute.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Table tennis with the Wii-Con could be pretty rad.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't knock it until you've tried it.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That might be kind of fun.

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I want table tennis extreme where I can take off people's heads with the fucking ball.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That'd be cool.

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We need freaking wire work ping pong.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It reminds me of...

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Or you could do clips and shit with the ball.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But, you know, I'm glad at least they're opening it up for Emorata Games to hopefully remove

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
this kind of, you know, impression that Nintendo was only for kids.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Because I think this console will be a lot better if they just get past that

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and publishers realize, okay, this is going to appeal to everybody.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Including people that like to beat hookers with a stick.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
GS191 in our chat room says,

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh great, hot coffee mod with Wiimote functionality.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What do you do?

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Stroke the Wiimote?

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Does it have a sensor on the side?

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't think it has a sensor for that.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No, they'll have an attachment.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They'll have, like, the dildo attachment.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Gross!

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry, after the movie we saw last night, I'm not even going to go there.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I took Jamie to see a very perverse movie last night.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's all we'll say.

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's change our tone here a little bit because this room's getting a little bit too giggly for me.

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And I think we need to bring on some anger.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What do you think, DarkSakura?

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's right, here it comes.

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
My first F.U. of the week.

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's actually a very serious matter.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I found out today that my cousin-in-law died from AIDS.

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He developed pneumonia, fell into a coma two weeks ago, and they pulled life support today.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So I'd just like to say a big F.U. to communicable diseases and people who don't take proper precautions.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know if that was his case, but I'm just saying everybody just please make sure either do it safely or don't do it at all.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Take the proper precautions.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sorry to hear that.

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
My F.U. of the week goes to a local church nearby here.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There was a story that came out that basically the city has told them that they cannot have their Christian rock bands come in anymore.

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They have this thing going on during the weekend called Club Retro or something like that where they have bands come in and stuff and they worship and whatever crap they do.

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So this has been going on for years now and they've received numerous complaints because they are too noisy.

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So they have filed basically this thing saying that you're running a nightclub in this church and this area is not zoned for a nightclub.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Plus you are being too noisy and there's too much problem with littering.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You guys are praying too loud.

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Exactly and so they are doing this silent protest in front of the church saying that this is unfair that they are taking away their right to worship.

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I say they are fucking retarded because they know exactly why they are not able to have these rock bands.

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's because they are running basically like a fucking nightclub.

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's pretty clear cut why.

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's because they are too fucking noisy.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can worship without having a fucking rock band.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There are churches out there that do that right now.

201
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You don't have to make a lot of noise for God to hear you, okay?

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Exactly.

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If you are worshiping someone who is omniscient and omnipresent, you can go, thanks God, and God will hear you.

204
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
True.

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You can raise a joyful noise unto the Lord but don't do it to where your neighbors wake up.

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I would like nothing more for them to lose their ability to actually have this rock band that would make me so super happy.

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And that's probably what's going to happen.

208
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Go government!

209
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Wow. We should get some emails on that one.

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
My FU of the week, I was going to do this big old thing but I'm just going to pass this week because I'm mad at a lot of things but it's really none of your business.

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So that's it.

212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And finally, I'm sorry, I had to step in here real quick.

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Fuck you Microsoft for your crappy vision camera because I cannot focus this thing for...

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I bet you it's just defective.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's just crap.

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Alright.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
First of all, this is a gaming related FU.

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
FU to the fucking stealth segments in Dirge of Cerberus.

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I fucking hate it when an otherwise good action game suddenly lapses in this forced stealth segment.

220
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Fuck it.

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It sucks.

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I hate stealth games.

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I will never be good at a stealth game.

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So why force me into these stealth segments?

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And second of all, FU2, the current arcade management at the local country of complaint.

226
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I went there yesterday with Dark Studios and Chatroom.

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
They had no less than five machines out of order including In the Groove and several racing games.

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They need to get this shit fixed and they don't, it's turning into the next Roseville Golf Land around here.

229
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And it fucking sucks.

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Fix your damn machines.

231
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What's the point of running an arcade if half your damn machines are going to be broken?

232
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Flash the lights.

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you wonder why arcades are dying in America?

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You guys make me cry.

235
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Alright.

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's get back into the gaming news, shall we?

237
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Sure, and we have some news for our UK listeners.

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The PAL version of Final Fantasy XII will be out in early 2007.

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
In the US, of course, the release date is October 31st.

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But I think it's funny.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There's a quote by the Square Enix CEO of Europe, John Yamamoto,

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
saying that it looks set to become one of the crowning glories of PlayStation 2.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That makes me laugh.

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because I don't really think that Final Fantasy XII is all that fantastic.

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The battle system is kind of bizarre.

246
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
However, you can probably see videos of it online.

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You play through as a princess and some dude hanging out with her to try to rescue their home.

248
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's called Active Battle...

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's the exact same plot of Enchanted Arms right now, actually.

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I swear to God, it is.

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It has a real-time exploration and this active dimension battle thing.

252
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Basically, you have this big line that comes from you to whatever your target is, and it's really stupid.

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And then your command screen pops up, and you can do that.

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You can switch your targets.

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No, it doesn't work.

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I liked it, FYI.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I tried really hard to give it a chance.

258
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I'm going to get the game.

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But I also loved Final Fantasy XI, and you thought you were going to go crazy.

260
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I gave Final Fantasy XI a chance.

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You did.

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Did I make it to level 24 white mage?

263
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You did. I know.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But you do talk a lot of shit about Final Fantasy XI.

265
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
At least you tried it. I'll give you that.

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I have room to talk shit about people who abuse their white mages.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
White mages are people, too.

268
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Heal, please.

269
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Fuck you.

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Heal, please.

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Port, please.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
No, no, no, no, no.

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because, see, my last party, I got revenge.

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I let our tank die, and then I killed all the critters because I was subbing black mage.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You are a healbot.

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
No, I'm not a healbot.

277
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I am a black mage in disguise.

278
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Heal, please.

279
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Shut up.

280
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Regen, please.

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That is why I will not play Fortnite.

282
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That is why I will not play priests in Ragnarok.

283
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
At least with a priest in Ragnarok, you can do random teleports and drop people in glassheim.

284
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay, okay.

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I've got to agree with you on that.

286
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
When I played Ragnarok Online with you, what did I say to everyone?

287
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't heal. I'm a battle alkalite.

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yep.

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And now you can actually take monk.

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes, and that fucking kicks ass.

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I am no one's healbot.

292
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm going to start playing Ragnarok again because I have my level 50-something assassin.

293
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I remember her.

294
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, have fun.

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Meanwhile, I'll be playing Final Fantasy XII before all our fans in Europe might have had.

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sorry, guys.

297
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I'll still be playing World of Warcraft after my whole turnout wears off.

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You are a TA.

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Hold on.

300
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Hold on.

301
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Did I not say in part A that I went back to WoW?

302
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I haven't touched Final Fantasy XI in two weeks, so Shane's very mad at me for that.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So, give me that.

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And then I'm going to play Final Fantasy XII.

305
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm going to play it before our British friends.

306
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Sorry, guys, but I just can't wait any longer.

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll let you all know how it is, though.

308
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, that's it.

309
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Well, damn, Rob.

310
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Where MMOs are concerned, you can't do anything without pissing someone off, can you?

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That means you're a bipolar MMO-er.

312
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I guess.

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

314
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Right?

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
All right.

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Here's...

317
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You know what's interesting?

318
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I love Final Fantasy so much, yet I still have not watched Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't know why.

320
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I just can't frickin' sit down for an hour and a half to watch it.

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
This you must do.

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, anyway, actually, what's been going on is that at a Tokyo game show, Square Enix

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
has revealed a new version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children with the subtitle,

324
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Complete is going to be released.

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's kind of like a director's cut.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There's going to be a higher resolution coming to Blu-ray, because this is going to be a

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
PlayStation 3, so it's going to be very sexy.

328
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Very, very sexy.

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Square Enix is also going to add some scenes and make some changes to existing scenes.

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
One new scene that was shown during the trailer was that Sephiroth was impaling Cloud and

331
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
hoisting him over his head while his Mazamune was still embedded inside of him, kind of

332
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
like Final Fantasy VII on the PlayStation 1.

333
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hmm.

334
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Should be interesting.

335
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You teases.

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I know.

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Now I have to find somebody who owns a Blu-ray player, or camp out and watch it at Best Buy,

338
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
or something on the TV there.

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's awesome.

340
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can't wait to see that.

341
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,600
Anyways, there's one thing we talked about last week, which was the Kingdom Hearts final

342
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,160
mix.

343
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:37,800
That is actually going to be including a PlayStation 2 remake of Chain of Memories in it as well.

344
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:44,560
So you will be able to get some nice Chain of Memories action going on.

345
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,800
I can tell from experience, by the way, that Chain of Memories on the Game Boy Micro is

346
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,040
a pain in the ass.

347
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,120
But now you can play it on PlayStation 2, nice and big and huge and all that good stuff.

348
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,880
I can play it on my macro and play it at work, I mean at school.

349
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,060
It says the game is going to feature full 3D graphics as well as some event cut scenes

350
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,600
that will feature the voices in Japanese, not English.

351
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,840
They were kind of scarce on the details about the additions to it.

352
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,680
That's kind of interesting though, the whole chains of memories being included thing.

353
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,800
I think that's pretty cool.

354
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,240
I actually dig Axl's Japanese voice, so hey, I'm all over that.

355
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,920
But Sega loves us, at least.

356
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Sega of America.

357
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
No they don't.

358
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,400
They haven't put out Jambo Safari.

359
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Hey, you know what?

360
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,840
They're bringing us Shining Force EXA to PS2.

361
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,520
Alright, I guess I can give them that.

362
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,160
I love Shining Force, I have the old ones.

363
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,560
It's my new background at work.

364
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,280
There's a screenshot from Shining Force EXA.

365
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
I need a Jambo Safari background.

366
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,560
Chairman, please assist.

367
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,680
It's going to be an action RPG.

368
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,760
It's going to be taking more of a strategy lean, although they're not giving any major

369
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,280
specifics on that.

370
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,680
And there is no release date yet announced.

371
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,440
But it's Shining Force, hey, Shining Force is awesome.

372
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,560
Alright, well, one thing that's not so awesome is the lawsuit, especially when you're on

373
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
the receiving end.

374
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,600
And this week, the Ant Commandos have been on the receiving end of a lawsuit.

375
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,840
The Ant Commandos are a California based company that sells Guitar Hero peripherals, specifically

376
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,100
a wireless guitar controller.

377
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,680
Well guess what, Red Octane has come in and sued their asses.

378
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,560
Red Octane is not happy about the unrepentant unlicensedness.

379
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,960
Defendants have copied the packaging of plaintiff's products and have used plaintiff's trademarks

380
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,880
and copyrighted material in its packaging and advertising of its own products in an

381
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,720
effort to cause confusion among consumers.

382
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:58,040
Now, you can't help but go, didn't Red Octane start as a DDR pad manufacturing company?

383
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:06,640
However, I will say this, at one point, didn't Konami officially recognize Red Octane as

384
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,640
like their, you know, their cool, we recognize them as like a pad manufacturer?

385
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,360
I want to say at one point they did.

386
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
On top of that, Red Octane didn't.

387
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,040
I'm almost positive, until In the Groove came out, then all bets were off.

388
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:27,240
Red Octane also didn't actually go and use the official DDR logo on their product.

389
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,480
They didn't say, we are doing this for Konami, the Konami logo didn't show up anywhere on

390
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
there.

391
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,280
I've seen these wireless guitar controllers and I played one and it's complete ass.

392
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,000
So if I were Red Octane and this company is going out using our, you know, logo and our

393
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,880
name and putting out this, you know, utter crap product, I would definitely sue.

394
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,240
And the other side of it is just stupid too, because I'll, Rob, you had more to that.

395
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Yes, I will.

396
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Kage in our chatroom, I just wanted to say, made it funny.

397
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,440
I heard they hired Edgeworth to rep the prosecution side.

398
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,000
Objection!

399
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,240
Objection!

400
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,720
Not even von Karma can make that argument work.

401
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,280
Well the Ant Commandos were not going to take this lying down, and with a name like Ant

402
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,400
Commandos, you wouldn't expect them to.

403
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Don't they sound pretty hardcore?

404
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,160
They sound like a shitty indie band.

405
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:29,440
Well the Ant Commandos actually have counter-sued Red Octane and given this timeline as their

406
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
proof.

407
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,920
1999, Topway Electrical Appliances, a part owner of TAC, patents the magical guitar controller

408
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,880
for Konami's Guitar Freaks.

409
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
The design had five fret buttons, very similar to what Guitar Hero has now.

410
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,240
2001 to 2004, the CEO of Red Octane as well as the sales manager made several visits to

411
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,840
a Topway factory in China and inquired about the magical guitar controller.

412
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,280
From 2001 to 2004, Red Octane purchased several hundred magical guitar controllers, and in

413
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,360
2005, Red Octane releases Guitar Hero with a controller that looks exactly like the magical

414
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
guitar.

415
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Hold it.

416
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,000
I can't say that because they licensed the body shape for their guitars from Gibson.

417
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,720
Hold it.

418
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,560
I see a little bit of a flaw here.

419
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,680
Why would you make a guitar controller with five fret buttons for a Guitar Freak which

420
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,760
only has three?

421
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,840
Well, you remember, they did.

422
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Hold on.

423
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Red Octane did.

424
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,920
They had five button controllers out before they ever announced Guitar Hero and people

425
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,960
were speculating that when Guitar Freaks V was first announced that possibly one of the

426
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,120
upgrades that was going to be in it is that it was going to be five buttons.

427
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Don't you remember this?

428
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Because Red Octane sold five button controllers for quite a while.

429
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,000
I never understood why they did that either.

430
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Now we don't.

431
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,880
I don't know if it was arcade only though, but I think there was an MCO arcade guitar

432
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
game.

433
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,320
I went digging through their Japanese site one time and found this in some type of keyboard

434
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,720
sim that they did too, but I didn't know if they ever had a home version of that.

435
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,640
If they did, then that makes sense.

436
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,640
Of course, if they had a home version of it, we would have heard of it.

437
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Interesting.

438
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:19,920
Besides the fact that Red Octane used to make DDR pads, does anyone find this kind of funny

439
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,840
that they're using almost the same terminology as the whole in the groove DDR thing?

440
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah, but technically, is the thing against them?

441
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,120
That's technically Rockstar, but I think Red Octane may fall under that a little bit because

442
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
they distribute the home version.

443
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,860
I want to say they got pulled into some addendum.

444
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,920
It's been so long since we covered that case now and we haven't really heard a lot on it,

445
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
which is a little bit odd.

446
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Yeah.

447
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,200
We should search the court doc system and see if anything new has come out recently

448
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,720
because there might have been a quiet settlement or something.

449
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Who knows?

450
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,920
I think it would be very interesting if there was.

451
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
I don't know.

452
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,880
I'd like to thank the chat room for sending me various Jambo Safari pictures for use of

453
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
my background.

454
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
I appreciate that folks.

455
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,200
God, I love OLR chatters.

456
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,880
All right, well another thing we love is OLR emailers and every week you send your emails

457
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,960
to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura suits up in her asbestos suit and shiny rubber

458
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,760
gloves and digs in and pulls out a few of her favorite emails and she reads them to

459
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,320
you, like she's going to do right now.

460
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Aren't you DarkSakura?

461
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:31,880
I had to break out the tongs this time.

462
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,360
Our first email comes from Eddie says, Hey, DarkSakura and Sky, as I have asked in chat

463
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,600
on the 200th episode, I would like to know where I can get some of the great music you

464
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
guys play on air.

465
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,440
I would certainly like to know of a legal way to purchase them if they can be found

466
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,740
in North America.

467
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,600
And I also would like to know of a way to obtain this music if importing it isn't a

468
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
viable option.

469
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,000
Thanks and congrats on hitting 200 jubilations.

470
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hooray.

471
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
All the best Eddie.

472
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Wow.

473
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,080
A lot of the songs we play on our station, you can find, you know, since we do have that

474
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,280
Bobani history, you go to a lot of music game soundtracks and not just DDR2DX, I mean, of

475
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,260
course that's a big bulk of it, but you know, of course a lot of the music we're pulling

476
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:18,200
now is from, you know, Sony series like Parappa and things, you know, put up by Namco, like

477
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,240
Technic Beat, whatever, Katamari, you know, game soundtracks.

478
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,040
And sometimes you can find these at your local comic book store.

479
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,280
I found actually sells, at least the local one here now sells anime and video game import

480
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
CDs.

481
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
They've actually been selling them for quite a few years here.

482
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Yeah.

483
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,840
And you know, you've also got conventions.

484
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
That's true.

485
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,000
Your conventions, you've got online ordering.

486
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,640
I've ordered a CDs through Amazon actually.

487
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,280
I ordered all my UK gorilla stuff on Amazon.

488
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,840
Another PS that's on here.

489
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm going to Granville Island on October 3rd.

490
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,020
If you can tell me some details about the cookie shop, I would gladly purchase some

491
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,560
cookies for OLRs, the 200th gift, and buy some for myself.

492
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,720
All I remember is that the guy who sold it sold nothing but maple stuff, which I'm sure

493
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,280
in Canada, you know, is probably pretty common, sorry, but I just remember the guy was right

494
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
near an entrance.

495
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,600
He sold nothing but maple stuff and he had cookies were on one side and he would give

496
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,320
a free sample if you wanted it.

497
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,480
I'll take a picture of the box and put it on the forums.

498
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
How's that?

499
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,400
And that'll give you something to look for because I might still have the box somewhere.

500
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,040
Send us some if we pay shipping.

501
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,160
I just might.

502
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I like maple cookies.

503
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,960
Yeah, maple's delicious.

504
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,200
I need something to remind me of Vancouver because I want to go back, but I'm poor.

505
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:43,360
We also had a nice article sent to us by Robway and it's On Planet Xbox 360, which came first

506
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,440
the violence or the video game.

507
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,120
It's a pretty big article and it goes into a lot of detail.

508
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,720
It's a freaking three-page article, but I would suggest our listeners, I'm going to

509
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,460
put it in the chat room, but everyone should go look on planetxbox360.com and I'd say look

510
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,440
for this article because it actually is a very good one.

511
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,360
I'm linking it in the chat room right now.

512
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
There it is.

513
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,040
Sweet.

514
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,360
As far as the next mail is concerned, kind of a long one.

515
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,740
Hooray, long emails.

516
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,480
This is actually from McFloyd.

517
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,680
It says, Dear OLR crew, I've been listening to your podcast for over a year and a half

518
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,800
now, so I thought it was really about time I expressed my thoughts on the show.

519
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,960
I mainly wanted to say that I really love the show.

520
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,360
Over the past two years, I've moved twice from Japan to the US to Switzerland because

521
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,820
my dad's a diplomat.

522
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,800
We have a one-year temporary posting in DC.

523
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,780
Needless to say, I have had to leave a lot of friends behind and it's really great having

524
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,040
something I can depend on through all of this chaos, a constant set of voices reassuring

525
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,600
me that if one thing can stay the same, life can resume being normal again.

526
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Wow, that's really sweet.

527
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Thank you.

528
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,020
I was in Tokyo for four years and unfortunately, I didn't take advantage of the fact that Tokyo

529
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,380
is the center of the gaming world, but now I'm in Switzerland, which is ridiculously

530
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,240
expensive and far, far away from being any kind of gaming center.

531
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,160
Now, as I begin high school, I'm getting more and more into video games and being here certainly

532
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
doesn't help.

533
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,740
You guys always have good advice, or almost always, and you really love the games, which

534
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
is very important.

535
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,660
I greatly depend on your podcast for most of my gaming news and for a source of entertainment

536
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
to and from school.

537
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,480
In the summers, the podcast helps me through lawn mowing jobs and throughout the year.

538
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,040
It's my favorite gaming podcast of the three that I listen to.

539
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Thank you so much.

540
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Wow.

541
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,160
This next part actually has a lot of good insight.

542
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,400
I wanted to comment on the gaming laws and people against video gaming.

543
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
You guys are completely right.

544
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,280
This is a violation of our First Amendment rights.

545
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,360
If this is a free country, people have to have the right to express themselves however

546
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
they want.

547
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,960
By banning one thing, issues for similar things will come up and from those issues from other

548
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
issues.

549
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,000
What about violent or sexually explicit movies or music?

550
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,860
Are we going to ban those things and make it illegal for a minor to possess them at

551
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,240
all or to view them?

552
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,520
The government has no right to control what we see, what we hear, what we do.

553
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,400
Also, as being allowed to buy violent video games to play them, what will they do instead?

554
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,560
I believe we'll end up with more violence in real life.

555
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,560
The adults who are trying to get these laws passed neither understand video games nor

556
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,380
see how video games are developing and are blindly scared of this new trend of kids playing

557
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,360
these games more and more.

558
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,520
Video games are actually becoming more and more active with such games as DDR, Guitar

559
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Hero and the Wii controllers evolving from previous ideas.

560
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,120
Basically, the e-mail goes a little bit further into the educational games like Brain Age,

561
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Civilization.

562
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,280
You're a fan of Civilization.

563
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,400
Good job.

564
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,800
Games that are helping.

565
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,120
I like this person a lot.

566
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,480
I'd say if you're going to high school and have this type of insight, I am looking forward

567
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,040
to see what you're like at a high school.

568
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,480
Well, consider what he said his dad does too.

569
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,200
He's a diplomat, so it's kind of interesting.

570
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,320
To me, that makes this insight especially interesting knowing that the dad is in this

571
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,120
very political position.

572
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,640
I like what's said here.

573
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:16,120
Adults should understand that this is just the new age of people and help children choose

574
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,120
games that are appropriate, active or even educational if need be helping them understand

575
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,080
the issues in the more violent games.

576
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,940
Video games are very different from what they experienced as children and learning by doing

577
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,280
is the best way, so video games have a huge potential in not only letting people have

578
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,080
fun, but in teaching the things that they'll remember much better.

579
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,480
The last paragraph, I'll just read that.

580
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,200
Finally, although this is just a little late, congratulations on your 200 episodes, so Loki,

581
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,120
Dark Sakura, Sky, keep up the great work and I'm looking forward to 200 more episodes.

582
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,920
We'll try.

583
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,360
If you're listening, I hope you are, I would actually like your permission to put this

584
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,080
one up on our forum.

585
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,520
Letter of the week.

586
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,160
And not just because they kissed our ass, but it helps.

587
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,640
It's a very well thought out email.

588
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,640
I have a question for anyone that's in the chat room that might have an Xbox Live Vision

589
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
camera.

590
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,360
Is it fucking blurry as mine is?

591
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,080
Because seriously, I cannot focus this thing no matter what kind of light is in the room,

592
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,440
no matter if it's trying to focus something far away, close, it does not matter.

593
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,040
It's so goddamn blurry.

594
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,320
Goddamn, here we are trying to say something nice about a listener and it all comes back

595
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,080
to me, me, me, me, me, doesn't it, Loki?

596
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,440
Yes it does.

597
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,240
You selfish ass.

598
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,080
I'm just curious.

599
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,520
I want this thing to work.

600
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,000
I do want it to work so I can play UNO and make funny faces at people and stuff like

601
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,600
that, but I can't do that until it's not blurry because I just look like a fucking ghost in

602
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,380
this thing, so that doesn't work.

603
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,240
And once again, SSG100Matt has said, Loki, it's your face.

604
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,200
It's not my face because I pointed at you too and you're still blurry, so...

605
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm beautiful.

606
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,000
That's what you get for watching the videotape.

607
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,080
They say try to clean the lens, God punishing you because you're complaining about the praisers

608
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,120
at the church making a lot of noise.

609
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,080
But he was messing with that beforehand.

610
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,680
I don't understand how I can clean the lens seeing as I just opened this thing up.

611
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,520
I mean, how would it be dirty already?

612
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Hey, email.

613
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Email's nice.

614
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Yes, email.

615
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Hi, OLR.

616
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
Hi, listener.

617
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
This is from DNL.

618
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,920
Oh, okay.

619
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
We love you, DNL.

620
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Thank you.

621
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Happy episode 201.

622
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,160
I know that I didn't get a chance to wish you guys a happy 200, but the biggest part

623
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,600
of reaching a milestone is the aftermath, though I've only been on the show once live

624
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,360
at B3 when I met Rob for the first time.

625
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,040
Was that when me and Megumi decided to run away?

626
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
I think so.

627
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,480
B3 was this big DDR tournament that took place at Pier 39 in San Francisco, and this was

628
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,040
probably in about our second year of existence that we did the B3 thing.

629
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,080
We weren't quite to 100 yet, but we were definitely getting old.

630
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,600
Megumi and I were really hungry.

631
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah.

632
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,060
I'll tell you what.

633
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:07,600
Doing live radio coverage for two days straight takes a lot of talent that I'm not so sure

634
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:14,800
we all have because we... Seriously, I wish I had recordings of some of that old stuff,

635
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,360
and I just might somewhere, but I seem to recall there was one DDR tournament that we

636
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,800
covered that Loki ended up sitting in the back, and he's just going, yeah, so DDR tournament

637
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,400
going on, or somebody's sitting in the background, and I'm like, yeah, for hours, and I had a

638
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,080
cold, and I didn't... Oh, God, that was so funny.

639
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
That was a shaft.

640
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Was it?

641
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
That was a shaft.

642
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
All right.

643
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
I hated it.

644
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,880
I was busy with the tournament and the fried Twinkies, but no, Megumi and I ended up leaving

645
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,240
the tournament, and by the way, not meaning to cut in on the email, I would also like

646
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:52,520
to give Megumi and her fiance a congratulations on their upcoming wedding.

647
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
Yay, weddings.

648
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Congratulations for your engagement.

649
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Yay, everybody getting married but me.

650
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,600
I make no comment.

651
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,840
Being married is not all it's cracked up to be.

652
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,860
Anyway, I've been listening on and off for three years, but started listening regularly

653
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,760
as soon as there was a podcast.

654
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,860
That's right from the very beginning, and Rob, he's so nice.

655
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,120
I had only seen him twice before both at competitions, but when we bumped into each other literally

656
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,320
at the Dear Friends concert before E3 2004, and he remembered my name and even introduced

657
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,400
me to the awesome VX Jason XV, the amazing mod, and then there was Roscoe's, but enough

658
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
with the reminiscing.

659
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Cheers to another X amount of episodes.

660
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,520
Renee is just the cutest girl you'll ever meet.

661
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,360
I mean, she's adorable.

662
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
You need to come on the show, Renee.

663
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
I know you're listening.

664
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
You need to come on the show.

665
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,440
I just would put her in a box and bring her out for the show.

666
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Oh, I'm here.

667
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
She's so cute.

668
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I'm just kidding.

669
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
I wouldn't leave you.

670
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Yeah, I put holes in it so you can breathe.

671
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,440
Because you're damn sure used to oxygen.

672
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,680
Just two more little ones.

673
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Okay.

674
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Hello, OLR.

675
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
My name is Thomas, and I'm a big fan.

676
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,320
I just wanted to say hello for the first time.

677
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,360
I live all the way in Belgium, so unfortunately I'm not able to listen to the live show.

678
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,040
Well, thank you for emailing us from all the way in Belgium.

679
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,200
Rad.

680
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
We love our international friends.

681
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,160
The last one is from Ranma.

682
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:25,400
Yes, Ranchan has decided to email us, so I'm going to go over the highlights of this email,

683
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
okay?

684
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Hi, OLR.

685
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Ranma here.

686
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,280
Isn't that how he also greets us on Skype?

687
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
I think so.

688
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,080
You're on the show too damn much, Ranma.

689
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
I don't know.

690
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
No, I'm kidding.

691
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
What's he got to say?

692
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
We love Ranma.

693
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Oh, we do.

694
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,440
I truly enjoyed episode 200, and I listened to it again on my way to work last week, and

695
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,800
I just have to say that you, Jamie, are truly a voice in the female gaming.

696
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,660
I have had a few female gamers on my friends list, but you by far are the most vocal and

697
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,120
outspoken of them all.

698
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
That's just because I'm a bitch.

699
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,000
I truly respect you for that, and don't ever lose that edge of yours.

700
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, thank you.

701
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,920
Anywho, there are a couple of things I wanted to point out from a couple of past episodes

702
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,760
just in case I missed tonight's episode.

703
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,160
One, price of the Wii remote.

704
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,800
I don't know why people are angry over the price.

705
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,900
The standard Xbox 360 pad is $50, and I don't hear anyone complain about that one.

706
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,560
The Wii remote is more than just a controller.

707
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,240
It has more features than any other next-gen controller out there, and it's less expensive.

708
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,260
Two, techno DDR Heaven.

709
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,680
About two weeks ago, I was with my friends at South Street Seaport, and we heard some

710
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
techno music.

711
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,600
My friend Carmen said, is it wrong to think of DDR when hearing techno?

712
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,680
I replied, it's not wrong.

713
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
It's in the groove.

714
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,440
No, it's not wrong unless it's in the groove, and we laughed and got closer, and the song

715
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,960
was Heaven from DDR Max US 1, I think.

716
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,760
I figured you'd all get a laugh out of that.

717
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
That is pretty funny.

718
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,880
Three, Enchanted Arms Gay Voice.

719
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,920
Yes, Rob, I totally agree with that.

720
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,440
I was listening to a CAG cast, and they put clips of it, and the guy was so flaming gay.

721
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,160
To quote South Park, gay, totally gay, Liberace gay.

722
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,360
That was the one that they're trying to show me last night.

723
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,880
They have sunglasses on now.

724
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,760
With no disrespect, why is the cheap-ass gamer cast talking about that $60 game?

725
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
That ain't cheap.

726
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,520
That ain't a cheap game.

727
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
I'm just kidding.

728
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Do what you want.

729
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Do what you want.

730
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
FF12 Day.

731
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,920
I am excited about this, and I will be there as Black Mage.

732
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,480
I will take pictures for all.

733
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,560
Five, SNK New Hardware.

734
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,440
What SNK needs to do is make better hardware technology.

735
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,400
Every time they make a game on their normal equipment, in less than three weeks after

736
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
it's out, the ROMs of it are totally found online.

737
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,640
In my honest opinion, that's a major reason why they are losing money.

738
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,040
Yeah, true.

739
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:37,920
Although, I was one of the people that paid $390 for KOF 2000, but mmm.

740
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,440
Loki's I'm Staying In.

741
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Thank you so much for playing that.

742
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,680
The song reminded me of how long I've been listening to you guys.

743
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,200
I truly thank Rai-Chan for telling me about you guys.

744
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,480
I'm surprised we didn't get more emails on that.

745
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,960
Thank God.

746
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,560
I would guess that I have been listening since episode 50 or so, and for a dial-up station,

747
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
that was a really good stream.

748
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,960
Back in the day, we were.

749
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,320
Seven, Dance Revolution.

750
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,080
After seeing it again, I say that it has already gotten old.

751
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,200
They had eliminated two teams.

752
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,520
The remaining three were doing new dance routines to the same techno dance beat as the first

753
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
episode.

754
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,840
What Dance Revolution needs is to allow teams to dance and choreograph songs from any of

755
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,320
the DDR games, and maybe, just maybe, let the Slumber Party Girls cover a B4U track.

756
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,720
Well, that's all for now.

757
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,760
I'll try to call in if I can.

758
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,560
If not, have a great episode 201, and by the way, wouldn't this be like the fifth season

759
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
of OLR Live?

760
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,720
Oh, and Rob Iami said that we can plan out SkyCon in October.

761
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
I'm still looking forward to that.

762
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,120
I think we kind of dropped the whole distinguishing seasons thing.

763
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,320
I can tell you that behind the scenes, we've been trying to iron out a new website, and

764
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:46,280
probably with that will come some very superficial type changes when it comes to art and logos

765
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,400
and things of that nature, but that won't be until probably the end of the year going

766
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,720
on into 2007.

767
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,940
But we know our website is not the best, so we kind of want to do what we can to make

768
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,940
it better.

769
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
Our website is special.

770
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,600
I mean, God, don't get me wrong, I mean, Jason's done so much work into it and stuff, but we're

771
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
just fine.

772
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,680
We're starting to realize the limitations of the software when it comes to what we want

773
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,440
to do aesthetically, and I think there's been talk behind the scenes that we want to take

774
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,880
our front page news in a real different direction.

775
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,760
So more to come on that by the end of the year.

776
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,540
Flaming Bozo told us we should be on XM.

777
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
That's very sweet.

778
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,540
We should.

779
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,540
Write XM and tell them that.

780
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,040
Tell XM to pick us up.

781
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
That's it for email.

782
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
Sweet.

783
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
Well, thank you, emailers.

784
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Send us more.

785
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,320
Mail back at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

786
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
You guys rock.

787
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,400
And we'll let Rob read it all.

788
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,480
Well, there's some pretty cool stuff coming out from TokugameShow from Namco Bandai, and

789
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,500
it's about this game that used to be called Trusty Bell, or at least it's Trusty Bell

790
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
in Japan.

791
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,440
Japan, now it's coming over here as Eternal Sonata, which is a pretty cool looking RPG.

792
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,480
God, isn't this the one where you're like in Chopin's mind or something like that?

793
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Yeah.

794
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,440
Oh, God, that game looks weird, but cool.

795
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah, so we'll be seeing that probably next year at some point.

796
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm kind of glad they're having the faith to port that over, but I would like more information

797
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,960
on Blue Dragon US port, please.

798
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Okay, thanks.

799
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
I want a remake of Blue Dragon.

800
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,240
How is Blue Dragon nowhere in our show world tonight?

801
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,880
Okay, I want to say something about Blue Dragon then, right now.

802
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:26,080
There were lines like 90 minutes long to see Blue Dragon over at the Tokyo Game Show, which

803
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
isn't a surprise.

804
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,200
Well, it is a surprise when you consider it's an Xbox 360 game and this is Japan.

805
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,860
But when you consider that, you know, remember when it was big, you know, turn heads that

806
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,920
some of the people behind Final Fantasy had gone over to the Xbox side?

807
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,680
Well, this is the game.

808
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,120
You know, this is the big game.

809
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,320
And I'll tell you what, from the previews I saw, it looks pretty hot.

810
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,480
I can't wait to play it, so I would wait in a 90 minute line to play Blue Dragon as well.

811
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,480
Hell, we waited probably about 60 to see Spore, and some people waited about three times as

812
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,560
long to see the Wii, so why not?

813
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,680
And some of us didn't.

814
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,680
Some of us just sort of waited.

815
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,440
Well, some of you just can kiss my butt.

816
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
You know what?

817
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
That's okay.

818
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,040
I'm used to having my ass be the one kissed, so huh-huh.

819
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:15,680
As far as news, Microsoft has said that they are going to waive the cost of repairs on

820
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,640
Xbox 360 consoles that were manufactured before January 1st, 2006, and refund any fees already

821
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,640
paid.

822
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:32,400
They were basically doing an analysis of the repair, and basically it was the initial manufacturing

823
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
run of the machine.

824
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,200
They've determined where a lot of problems are, and they keep having them come in from

825
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
that.

826
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,160
They said that it was a higher rate than what they are happy with, so they've decided to

827
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:50,880
comp repairs for any of the consoles manufactured before January 1st, 2006, and do those refunds.

828
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,280
I'd say you probably have to contact Microsoft technical support.

829
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,920
They did actually, though, say that they rejected claims of an unusually high hardware failure

830
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
rate.

831
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,580
Well, good for Microsoft for doing the right thing with this, I think, because I think

832
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,480
to charge somebody for these broken systems just because their 90-day warranty was up

833
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,520
was kind of mean, but I think the window needs to be extended a little bit.

834
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,540
I bought my Xbox 360 in February, and that thing broke right away, and I would be pissed

835
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,840
if I was right on the bubble there January, February, and mine broke.

836
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,600
I think it's obvious that there were still some production problems to the earlier year,

837
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,080
so thank you, Microsoft, for taking a step in the right direction.

838
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,760
Now take one more, in my opinion.

839
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
They need to.

840
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:41,440
Anyway, hmm, a quick story kind of relating to Xbox 360.

841
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,240
The official Xbox magazine ran a promo from Circuit City, and Circuit City was giving

842
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,840
away this coupon that said that they were going to be offering 15% off of 99 Nights

843
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,080
and Gears of War.

844
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,280
Hey, pretty cool, except for the fact that the coupon was set to expire October 31st,

845
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,720
so while you could get 15% off 99 Nights, that thing won't do you a damn bit of good

846
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,600
when it comes to Gears of War, because Gears of War is not coming out until November.

847
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,760
Well, just so you know, a clarification has arrived, and this, by the way, didn't make

848
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Circuit City look good, because there was that whole story a couple weeks ago about

849
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,680
the one in San Diego that was offering to install the backwards compatibility on your

850
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,680
Xbox for a fee.

851
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,040
I'm surprised it wasn't the best buy to say that.

852
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,500
That was so messed up.

853
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,560
But anyway, so Circuit City, you really have to dig themselves out of a hole, and they

854
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:33,760
are, Official Xbox Magazine sent something out that said Circuit City is aware that the

855
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,360
coupon in the November issue is messed up.

856
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,940
They're going to publish another coupon in the next issue of Official Xbox Magazine that

857
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:47,440
will extend the promotion through the end of November, I believe it was.

858
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,080
That's pretty cool, Elise.

859
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,080
That's nice of them.

860
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,880
And also, speaking of nice of people to do something for us, SNK finally got their head

861
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,280
out of their butt.

862
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:03,040
We are going to be getting a new King of Fighters with a complete visual overhaul, new sprites,

863
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,040
finally!

864
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:09,320
Because I remember sitting back and playing, like, what was it, KOF 2001, and it was the

865
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,680
same old Q. Yeah, we have Kula, you know, with everything.

866
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,240
It's like, no.

867
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,720
They finally have listened to us, and there actually is speculation that it's going to

868
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,720
be high res sprites like in the Guilty Gear series.

869
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,080
We can only hope that certain other publishers of ongoing 2D fighting series listen to us,

870
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,160
Capcom, please.

871
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,480
That's kind of hot that finally King of Fighters is getting some new sprites, because, you

872
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,160
know, Loki likes to bitch on every episode, and I'll admit I've done it too, that, you

873
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,280
know, with some of these games like Metal Slug and King of Fighters, they have not changed

874
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,960
the graphics one damn bit in the past ten years.

875
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,640
So someone at SNK has been listening.

876
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,800
You know what I would like to see, is I would like to see the KOF series get the Street

877
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,680
Fighter 3 treatment, with the extra animations and all of that.

878
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,080
Well, that's the thing about Metal Slug, actually, one of the things they announced this week

879
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,720
was that the Metal Slug Anthology is going to be including Metal Slug 6 as well.

880
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,920
And will it have new graphics?

881
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,320
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

882
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,200
But it has Metal Slug 6, I mean, that's got to be different than Metal Slug 5, or 4, or

883
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
3, or 2, or 1.

884
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,520
Well, you know, I'm not going to knock Metal Slug, it is a good game, and getting six of

885
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,540
them at one price is not going to be a bad deal, but I think if they're going to make

886
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,800
another standalone one, you might want to up the graphics to the new, you know, please

887
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,120
don't hear me wrong, a game doesn't have to have the greatest graphics in the world to

888
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,520
be a good game.

889
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:52,480
But you know, if the technology's there, is it that hard to change it and make it a little

890
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,480
nicer looking?

891
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
I don't know.

892
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,480
I don't expect you to be blown away.

893
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,200
I don't need, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War style graphics, I just want, you know.

894
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,680
Well, I even remember back in the day when Mugen was having its big day, there were actually

895
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,740
people going in and retouching a lot of sprites from old games and making completely new fighters

896
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,280
with the Mugen engine.

897
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:19,600
I don't know, I think it's kind of weird that, you know, I mean it's the 12th game and they

898
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,480
haven't really done much upgrades on it yet.

899
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,280
Well, one game that's kind of funny that Sony's been really, you know, touting is like, yeah,

900
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,080
this is our launch title for the PlayStation 3, check it out, it's got awesome tilt controller

901
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,840
technology functionality and stuff like that, oh, Warhawk, yeah, Warhawk's really awesome

902
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,360
and it's really awesome and the fact that it's delayed until summer of 2007 because

903
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,480
apparently, yeah, they're having trouble with it.

904
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:54,160
It's only listed as about 50% complete right now at Tokyo Game Show and it's not very good

905
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:00,800
seeing as it's supposed to be released in a few months, so, ouch, yeah, so that's official,

906
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,200
they've delayed it until 2007.

907
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,140
Yeah, and it says this has actually been confirmed by a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan fact

908
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:14,440
sheet that it's confirmed as a summer 2007 release, so, you know, with that out of the

909
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,600
way, you know, I guess there are only, there's not a lot of launch titles, at least you're

910
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,440
getting Ridge Racer 7, which does look pretty hot, Ridge Racer 7 is 100% complete, so yeah,

911
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,160
you will be getting that launch, so, and actually that's one of the first titles that's actually

912
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,560
being released, you know, because they usually release titles before the console launches

913
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,520
and that's actually one of the first ones that come out.

914
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,760
Good job Namco, good job.

915
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,240
Well, you might have heard during this week some dates get announced before they were

916
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,840
supposed to and among other things from Ubisoft, that's because somebody found a 2GB archive

917
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:57,140
file on the FTP server that had information, video, artwork and screens from all the upcoming

918
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:05,840
roster of Ubisoft titles, whoops, meaning that they discovered Far Cry Wii, Lost, Naruto,

919
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,220
Open Season, Rainbow Six Vegas, Splinter Cell 4, Surf's Up, Shaun White Snowboarding, Star

920
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:16,080
Wars Lethal Alliance on PSP, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Assassin's Creed.

921
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,400
There were also some previously unannounced games that were in this RAR file, a brand

922
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,300
new Prince of Persia, which seems to be something we've actually mentioned on this program previously

923
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,720
and Splinter Cell games and Far Cry and Rocky on the PSP.

924
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,280
You know, it's so funny because I thought Rocky had already been announced, I've had

925
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,280
actually a sell sheet for Rocky for about a couple of weeks now, I didn't know there

926
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,360
was an announcement, it's hard for me to keep track, oh well, but yeah, Rocky's coming out.

927
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,700
Anyway, that was a very interesting find on the internet and Dark Soccer likes to surf

928
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,260
the internet up and down and make interesting finds of her own and she'll share them with

929
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:59,520
you each and every week, I sure will, in this segment called the Website of the Week.

930
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,600
And no, it's not the Arcade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

931
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:11,760
My Website of the Week is actually an official website and anyone who's been reading my live

932
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:19,360
journal and listening to me go into fangasms over this, the Website of the Week is the

933
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,840
official Doctor Who website on the BBC website, because I love Doctor Who.

934
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:32,120
If you go to bbc.co.uk slash Doctor Who, you will go to the fantastic site where there's

935
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:38,360
lots of wallpaper with David Tennant all over it and Billy Piper all over it and K-9 and

936
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:44,520
Sarah Jane and everybody and downloadable mobile phone stuff and it's actually better

937
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,920
than just about any of the fan sites I've seen.

938
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:55,460
And there is even a link to the classic series too with a What is the TARDIS tutorial, so

939
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:04,600
as someone who has grown up with Doctor Who as a constant, a squee, fangasm, yep, I'm

940
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,120
proud of it.

941
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:16,760
Doctor Who, hey, Doctor Who, okay, sorry, I can't help but think of that whenever I

942
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,720
hear her talk about Doctor Who, that old band chair, you know that song that makes me want

943
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,720
to do?

944
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,720
What?

945
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
Kill People.

946
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,480
It's very ironic that, you know, that song makes me want to kill people because that's

947
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,320
what happens to those people that kill people for an Xbox, yeah, the Xbox Killers as they've

948
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:39,320
been kind of named now, Jerome Hunter and Troy Victorino.

949
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,320
Calling them the Xbox Killers makes them sound like they go into people's houses at night

950
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,560
like ninjas and like cut the cords from the Xbox and smash it with a hammer while everyone's

951
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,040
sleeping and then leaves the house silently.

952
00:53:52,040 --> 00:54:00,320
Well anyways, the Xbox Killers, they were sentenced to death, so yeah, apparently they

953
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:06,240
murdered six people in 2004 and yeah, now they're dead.

954
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,400
What exactly did they do?

955
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,680
They murdered them over an Xbox or what?

956
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,960
Well that's what they assumed because they stole an Xbox, it says the murders were vicious,

957
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,100
blood being found on the floors and ceilings and the walls and the victims were not only

958
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,280
bludgeoned to death but were mutilated afterwards.

959
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:31,160
And it says, you know, basically, you know, the killer, oh never mind, that's another

960
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,960
story where they're talking about that person who killed their child over the Xbox thing

961
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
too.

962
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:44,880
A lot of people causing violence over an Xbox, I don't know, hmm, I think the Wii will be

963
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,200
so much, so easily accessible to this kind of stuff, you know, especially when you get

964
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,840
those third party controllers or something that are shaped like a samurai sword or are

965
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:00,360
actually a samurai sword, ooh that'd be cool, samurai sword, you can kill people, alright,

966
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,360
or hookers.

967
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,400
You're just waiting for that with the Wii, aren't you?

968
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Yes.

969
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:10,600
Alright, anyway, that's just about going to wrap it up for news tonight, so that means

970
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:17,080
it's time for us to take your Skype calls and you can call us by visiting www.orangelaungeready.com,

00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:37,080
very near future, wouldn't that make a lot of you folks very happy.

975
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,840
Let's go to the phones, hi you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

976
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Ravenstaufen.

977
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,480
Hi Ravenstaufen, what's on your mind buddy?

978
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:51,480
You know that Xbox serial killer, in my view of this episode of the Boondocks, when we

979
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,280
were like, we gotta find the Xbox killer, we have to find him.

980
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,960
You have to set that up for me a little bit, you have to pardon my ignorance, but I don't

981
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,360
watch a whole lot of TV, so what's this show all about, wait, is that the cartoon one that's

982
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:07,640
on Adult Swim, I think I've seen a clip of it.

983
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,640
The show is a suburban, these are African Americans that is out of their unit and they

984
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,000
go to suburban life and see Huey and Dewey and they go on adventures and this episode

985
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,280
involved a guy going to jail because he got murdered over an Xbox and he went like, they're

986
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,200
gonna rape me, they're gonna rape me, you gotta do something, he went like hold on.

987
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,000
Was this before or after the real life Xbox killer?

988
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,680
Oh before, way before.

989
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,720
Hmm, interesting.

990
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,000
So is it possible that this show, maybe this person should be called the Boondocks killer?

991
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think so, because that's what makes me laugh about it, I was like oh god, this reminds

992
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,320
me of that episode.

993
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:54,320
Interesting reality mirroring fiction, kind of sad though, regardless of what inspired

994
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,080
it, these people should have known better, period.

995
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,080
Yeah.

996
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,600
Anything else on your mind, my friend?

997
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Two more things.

998
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Okay.

999
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,880
I got a bone to pick with you, Sky.

1000
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,880
What?

1001
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,840
Last time when I talked to you about DS Lite, you were running over with a car and I would

1002
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,560
get a black one.

1003
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,480
I did?

1004
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,840
I probably did.

1005
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,240
Yeah, you said buy the warranty and run it over with a car.

1006
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,320
Oh wait, I don't think I said that, I think the, uh, uh, uh, Miekletoff said it.

1007
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,320
Maybe I did, I don't know.

1008
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,320
Fine.

1009
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,720
Whoever who said it, I still had to pay 50 bucks for the black one.

1010
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,280
Did you seriously go and run over it with a car?

1011
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,400
No, thank god it had a hairline fracture.

1012
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Oh, okay.

1013
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,000
I was like, oh my god, please don't tell me you actually went and ran over it with a car.

1014
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
No, I would be sad.

1015
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,880
I'd like to see someone who did that.

1016
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,880
You know, Wal-Mart's return policy might let you do that.

1017
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,240
Oh, Wal-Mart, you can return anything at Wal-Mart, it doesn't matter if it's there.

1018
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,000
Somebody in chat had brought that up earlier, so just made me think of that, the whole Wal-Mart

1019
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,800
return policy is so, uh, liberal.

1020
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,400
Okay.

1021
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
What's the other thing?

1022
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,300
Uh, do you hold Christmas to a high regard, because you feel, when I listen to Orange

1023
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,360
Lounge Radio for a year, it feels like Christmas is nothing, just another day.

1024
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,840
Um, I hold Boxing Day in high regard.

1025
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,440
You know, I'll tell you what, in my personal family life, we don't have the whole big deal

1026
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,440
Christmas thing.

1027
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,480
We will do something on Christmas morning, but that's about it, and there's no children

1028
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,480
really in the family.

1029
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,360
We're kind of a small family unit, so it's not the big deal it is for some families.

1030
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,880
Oh, one more thing.

1031
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
Yeah.

1032
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,200
Dark Soccer, are you going to require an Elvira pinball game, because I love that game on

1033
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,200
the Atari Lynx.

1034
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Yes, I own that.

1035
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,680
Elvira pinball.

1036
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,680
That would be hot.

1037
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,680
You need to do that.

1038
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,240
Make that happen.

1039
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,520
I want to say, I've seen an Elvira pinball recently, because I know some people who own

1040
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
one.

1041
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,080
Isn't that the one that had the lower playing field?

1042
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,040
It's been so long, Dark, I'm sorry.

1043
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,280
I do believe, because I've seen one, I did see an Elvira pinball, the place that we got

1044
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,160
our last action hero from, I think, had an Elvira pinball in their little repair place.

1045
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,160
The last time I saw an Elvira machine was in Chico, where I went to school.

1046
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,160
So.

1047
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,320
Actually, next on our list is actually a Doctor Who pinball machine for me, and a Medivial

1048
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
Madness.

1049
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,520
What about, I know this is so random, what about an Austin Power one?

1050
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,920
That one has fond memories with me, too.

1051
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,200
It's a fun one, one I wouldn't mind, although I actually found, Dan found a place in town

1052
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,360
that has a Pirates of the Caribbean machine, one of the new Stern machines.

1053
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,360
I want to play that.

1054
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,360
It's $4,000, though.

1055
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,360
I don't have that.

1056
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,360
Yeah.

1057
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:43,760
You can only get them new, although from what I understand, the licensing to put out some

1058
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,880
of the prototype machines that Capcom had out, like Big Bang Bar, from what I understand,

1059
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,560
I think Stern acquired the licensing to release those now.

1060
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,200
I'll have to find that out for sure.

1061
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Yeah.

1062
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Would you?

1063
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,200
Definitely.

1064
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
As soon as I find that out, I'll make it public knowledge.

1065
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,200
All right.

1066
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Oh, let's party.

1067
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,600
That was a great staple.

1068
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,800
All right.

1069
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,440
As much as I'd love to reminisce about pinball all night, we've got other college we've got

1070
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,440
to get to.

1071
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,440
All right.

1072
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,440
Ravensdaupin.

1073
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
That's it.

1074
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
All right.

1075
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
Have a good night.

1076
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,440
You too.

1077
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,440
Bye.

1078
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,440
See ya.

1079
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,440
All right.

1080
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,440
Let's go to another call.

1081
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,440
Hi.

1082
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1083
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,440
Who's this?

1084
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
Hey.

1085
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
This is Anoush.

1086
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,440
Hi, Anoush.

1087
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,440
What's on your mind?

1088
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,440
Hey.

1089
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,040
I was just wondering if you guys heard about that software update that Microsoft's going

1090
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,640
to release for the 360 that's going to output 1080p.

1091
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,640
Hot damn.

1092
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,160
We left a lot of news off of tonight's roll.

1093
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,160
That is a biggie.

1094
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,360
Thank you for bringing that up.

1095
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,800
That was a big point that Microsoft did during their press conference that, oh, snap, Sony,

1096
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,800
we can do 1080p too, and we're doing it through a software update, bitch.

1097
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,800
Yeah.

1098
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:52,560
They're going to be able to do it, I know, through the TV either, well, not for movies,

1099
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,560
not through the HDTV.

1100
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,040
Well, aren't they going to upscale movies or something?

1101
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,440
Movies and stuff will be upscaled, and games will be upscaled with 1080p.

1102
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,560
You can do 1080p with a VGA cable.

1103
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,960
But now Sony's come back and kind of pooh-poohing that statement going, oh, but it's not native

1104
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,960
to 1080p.

1105
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,960
They're just upscaling things.

1106
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:13,960
Yeah, but if games are programmed to 1080p, they will play it natively at 1080p.

1107
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,960
Interesting.

1108
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,360
It's just, yeah, they're saying, oh, they're not natively 1080p.

1109
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,400
Well, yeah, neither are some of your games, so shut the hell up.

1110
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,240
News, I'll ask you, what do you think about the news?

1111
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,080
It doesn't really make sense to me, because wouldn't they put some kind of digital output

1112
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,160
on it, like HDMI?

1113
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,400
Well, technically, can't components handle 1080p?

1114
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,120
It's just not as, I mean, I don't know enough about video specs.

1115
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,360
They don't need HDMI to do 1080p.

1116
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:50,080
It's just HDMI is going to be required when they digitally sign, when a digital broadcast

1117
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,120
flag goes into effect in a few years.

1118
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,640
Why do I need HDMI over component?

1119
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,760
Is it just that much clearer of a picture, like component over S-video?

1120
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,200
I believe so.

1121
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,440
And also, I'm not sure, I can't remember if component can do 1080p.

1122
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,440
I think it can.

1123
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,960
I need to read up on Wikipedia.

1124
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,840
But I know HDMI, though, the big thing, and I think this is kind of one of the reasons

1125
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:16,880
why they added it to the lower end PS3 model, too, is so that they can support the broadcast

1126
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:23,480
flag for the movies and stuff, because otherwise, you know, in like 2009 or whenever this broadcast

1127
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,480
flag goes into effect, all your movies are going to be dropped down to 540p, and that's

1128
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,320
the highest they will go if you're watching Blu-ray.

1129
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,800
Jeremy Todd 1 has an interesting comment in chat.

1130
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,520
I'm sick of all this 1080p versus 1080i bullshit.

1131
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,800
95% of people won't even be able to tell the difference between the two.

1132
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,400
This is just an E-penis sort of thing.

1133
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,400
It is.

1134
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,160
Basically, you're not going to notice the difference unless you have a TV that's over

1135
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,960
like 48 inches and you're sitting six feet away.

1136
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,000
Anoush, do you own any next-gen systems yet?

1137
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
No.

1138
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,400
Are you planning on purchasing any of them?

1139
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,280
Yeah, I think I might go for a Wii and a PS3.

1140
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,520
A Wii and a PS3?

1141
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,080
So this doesn't sway you being somebody who wants to get a PS3?

1142
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,880
This doesn't sway you in Xbox's direction any?

1143
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,280
I kind of swore not to get an Xbox.

1144
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,040
Ooh, why's this?

1145
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,080
Um, totally against Microsoft.

1146
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,080
Okay, okay.

1147
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,560
Well, I know a lot of people who are in that camp.

1148
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,680
They just really don't want to...

1149
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,600
You know, I used to be in that camp, too, but I've got to say, there were just some

1150
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,040
of the games towards the end of the first Xbox run really finally convinced me that

1151
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,280
I needed to check it out, and I've been pretty happy with it.

1152
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,280
You know what I say, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1153
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:40,360
Let me guess, Anoush, are you a role-playing type fan?

1154
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,320
Those are your types of games, the games that Microsoft kind of lacks on?

1155
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,880
Not really.

1156
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,960
I'm more into racing games and FPS.

1157
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,760
Hmm, interesting.

1158
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,000
And yet you still don't like Xbox 360, because that's pretty much all they have right now.

1159
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
That's interesting.

1160
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
That's true.

1161
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Okay, interesting.

1162
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,880
Well, I mean, you're free to like what you like.

1163
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,040
There's no problem.

1164
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,280
But I was just kind of curious on your thoughts on how 1080p might sway your thoughts on that

1165
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,020
one way or the other.

1166
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,840
It wasn't really the 1080p that makes me want the PS3.

1167
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,800
It's more of like a fanboy thing.

1168
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,160
Okay, okay.

1169
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,760
Well, that's funny.

1170
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,000
What games are you looking forward to on PS3?

1171
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,840
Gran Turismo HD, from what you guys said, I'm kind of swaying against that now.

1172
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,560
Yeah, I was going to say, what does this whole microtransactions thing do to your opinion

1173
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,120
on that?

1174
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:34,880
Yeah, I'm kind of thinking that maybe Sony will give you like a points card with the

1175
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,880
game.

1176
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,880
I hope so.

1177
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,080
And you can download whatever you like, like so many points.

1178
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,080
We'll see.

1179
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,240
You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking about Wii 60 was this big thing.

1180
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,600
So we're going to get the Wii 60.

1181
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,280
And now I'm Mr. Gohan in chat saying it should be Wii S3.

1182
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,960
So you're in the Wii S3 camp.

1183
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,560
Yeah, I guess so.

1184
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,560
All right.

1185
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,560
Sounds good.

1186
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,560
Go register WiiS3.com before someone else does.

1187
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,560
Okay.

1188
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,560
All right, Anoush, take care.

1189
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,560
Yeah, you too.

1190
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
Bye-bye.

1191
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,560
Thanks.

1192
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,640
Let's go to another call.

1193
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,640
Let's go to this call.

1194
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,920
Too much feedback on that call.

1195
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,600
You got to fix your output settings there.

1196
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,760
You can always call if you're a first time Skype caller, Echo123 is the name that you

1197
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,760
can call there.

1198
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,320
And you can hear yourself and see how you sound.

1199
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,320
Let's go to this call.

1200
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1201
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,320
Who's this?

1202
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,320
Holy crap.

1203
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,320
You scared the crap out of me.

1204
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,320
It's DMN.

1205
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,320
Boo.

1206
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,320
Hi, DMN.

1207
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
Ah.

1208
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,320
What's on your mind?

1209
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,640
Actually, something you guys haven't talked about today.

1210
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,320
His skull is on his mind.

1211
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:45,800
The totally unprofessional comments about Sony calling the Xbox 360's HD DVD drive quote-unquote

1212
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,040
unfortunate.

1213
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:54,360
I don't have the link to the article handy, but basically, Sony said your HD DVD drive

1214
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:00,160
sucks and we're better in a very unprofessional sort of way, yet very business-like.

1215
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,680
Everybody's just waving their cocks around, I mean.

1216
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:12,020
The marketplace will choose the ultimate victor and then I believe bragging rights can be

1217
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,020
bestowed.

1218
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,640
But yeah, it's just they're talking trash because they're trying to talk their own thing

1219
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,140
up because it's coming out soon.

1220
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,140
But I don't know.

1221
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,560
I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.

1222
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:27,240
My friend and I went into a Best Buy this week and finally, after all this time, I got

1223
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:32,200
to see an HD DVD and a Blu-Ray side by side.

1224
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,640
And I'll tell you what, I have to say I think the Blu-Ray did look a little better.

1225
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,160
But there are some other factors to take into consideration here because my friend who was

1226
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,900
with me, David, said the other TV's kind of crappy and plus they're playing ultraviolet

1227
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:51,640
on the Blu-Ray, which is as crappy as the movie is, I'm sure, is meant to look very

1228
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,160
stylish and cool, whereas over here you're getting like the Manchurian Candidate or something

1229
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,880
that's not really action-packed.

1230
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,880
So I don't know.

1231
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,760
My first impression did tell me that, you know what, Blu-Ray was a little prettier.

1232
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,600
Blu-Ray is a little prettier but a little pricier.

1233
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:15,600
Like HD DVD players, I think, run at the cheapest around $500, whereas Blu-Rays are like $1,000.

1234
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,200
This is beta versus VHS all over again, all over again.

1235
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,880
You know, I read somewhere and I think we had to cut it from our show roll, but Loki,

1236
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,360
maybe you'd remember this because I think you were the one that posted it in our super

1237
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:30,680
secret thread, something about some company was going to be making discs that did both

1238
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,160
HD DVD and Blu-Ray.

1239
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,320
It's Warner.

1240
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,440
They patented technology, I guess.

1241
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:41,040
It's DVD, Blu-Ray, and HD all in one.

1242
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,040
Smart.

1243
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,760
And I imagine they're going to use it for their movies.

1244
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,760
Smart.

1245
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,760
So no matter what format it goes, they're supporting it.

1246
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,960
I think that's a great idea, but I'd rather it go to one format or another.

1247
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,160
They already have the hybrid discs with the HD DVD and DVD, you know, one side's HD and

1248
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:10,040
the other side's not, so I wish this whole format war thing would end and just come up

1249
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,040
with something.

1250
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,600
We'll see what happens.

1251
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,160
Anything else you wanted to say, Diemen?

1252
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,840
You're cutting out there, my friend.

1253
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,840
There you go.

1254
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,840
Sorry.

1255
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,120
It's rubbing my face.

1256
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,880
I just posted a link in the chat room if anybody wants to take a look at that.

1257
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,040
What is it?

1258
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,720
GameSpot dot something dot, I don't care.

1259
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,200
I know, but what is it that I'm going to look at if I pull this up?

1260
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:39,200
It's the article regarding Sony talking their shit.

1261
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,800
Well, this is close to launch.

1262
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,320
Who wouldn't want to whip it out?

1263
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,320
Let's see.

1264
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:50,160
Quote from Dave Caracker, the Senior Director of Corporate Communications for Sony Computer

1265
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:55,280
Entertainment America, quote, it's unfortunate that Microsoft's external HD DVD drive will

1266
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,440
not enhance the experience at all for the gamer.

1267
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,000
Sony realizes that to truly take gaming into the next generation requires a larger data

1268
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,960
format for both games and movies.

1269
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,280
PS3 uses the Blu-ray format for gaming, giving developers 50 gigabytes of high definition

1270
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,960
storage on a single disc, while Microsoft's 9 gigabyte DVD gaming format is an obstacle

1271
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,800
for storing HD content.

1272
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,040
Sounds like typical cock waving to me.

1273
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:22,080
It's not like he said, God, the 360's a piece of shit.

1274
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,080
True.

1275
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,680
This is more the point and laugh tactic.

1276
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:30,920
Yeah, this is just more the trying to emphasize what's good about theirs and how it outshines

1277
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,920
the other one.

1278
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,960
Well, that was about it.

1279
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,960
You guys have a good night.

1280
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,960
All right, you too, buddy.

1281
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,960
Thanks for the topic.

1282
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,960
All right.

1283
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:40,960
Bye-bye.

1284
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:41,960
Bye.

1285
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,160
Wow, callers are calling in with lots of good things we should have been thinking about

1286
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,160
earlier.

1287
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,160
Let's do one more call.

1288
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,080
I know some other folks are trying to get through, but we got to wrap it up here pretty

1289
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,080
soon.

1290
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,080
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1291
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,080
Who's this?

1292
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,080
Good to meet you, 83.

1293
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,720
Hi, you're a little bit quiet.

1294
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,520
Try to get a little closer to your mic if you can and tell us what's on your mind.

1295
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,120
Yeah, my mic's a little quiet.

1296
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,120
What's on your mind?

1297
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,120
24 the game.

1298
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,360
Oh, 24 the game.

1299
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,120
What about it?

1300
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,240
It's pretty good.

1301
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,160
Is this something you just picked up this week?

1302
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,160
No, I won it.

1303
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,200
Oh, that's right.

1304
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,920
Okay, well, it's a pretty good game?

1305
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,960
The game's okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good.

1306
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,960
Yeah?

1307
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:22,960
How is it if you're a fan of the show?

1308
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:29,240
Oh, if you're a fan of the show, you definitely got to try it.

1309
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,740
What kind of game is it?

1310
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,700
For those that don't know what to expect out of 24 the game, what kind of game could you

1311
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,700
compare it to?

1312
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,700
It's a third-person shooter.

1313
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:41,420
There's a few minigames in it, and there's some really crappy driving in it.

1314
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:42,960
Really crappy driving in it?

1315
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,360
Yeah, it's the worst driving I've ever played, but the rest of it's pretty good.

1316
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,360
All right, awesome.

1317
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,160
Well, I'm glad you've had a chance to check that out.

1318
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,600
You're a little bit quiet, so I've got to keep this short, but is there anything else

1319
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,240
you want to share with our listeners?

1320
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Not really.

1321
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,760
All right, well, have a good one and enjoy the game.

1322
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,280
Yeah, see you.

1323
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,280
Bye-bye.

1324
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,600
A little minigame review there on the Skype line, but that's what it's for.

1325
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,640
You guys can call in and tell us your thoughts on things.

1326
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,640
We appreciate it.

1327
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,160
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.

1328
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,680
I'll try again next week.

1329
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,880
What can I say?

1330
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,440
Any other last-minute stories here in studio?

1331
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,720
In other news, I'm still awesome.

1332
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,760
Was anyone ever questioning that Dark Sakura?

1333
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:29,440
No, I just have to keep making a mention.

1334
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,720
But if you disagree, send us an email.

1335
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,320
If you disagree, keep it to yourself.

1336
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,320
All right.

1337
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,760
Anything from you, Loki?

1338
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,320
I'm trying to think.

1339
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,080
I know there was some other stuff I had.

1340
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:46,160
I'm looking real quick here, because I shut down my list, because I suck.

1341
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,280
I'm trying to think here.

1342
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,680
Let's see.

1343
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,680
Great radio.

1344
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,040
Yeah, I think we might have to wrap it up if you don't have anything else.

1345
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,040
Okay, here we go.

1346
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,000
Well, a couple of small things.

1347
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,680
There was a couple of stories.

1348
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,160
First off, no PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories coming out.

1349
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,160
That makes me sad.

1350
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,160
None at all?

1351
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,160
None at all.

1352
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:15,360
I'm not sure why, but there isn't one, so that's kind of interesting.

1353
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:21,600
Microsoft announced that they're doing Platinum Hits on the Xbox 360, and the first four titles,

1354
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,720
three of which already have a price drop on the $29.99, which is going to be the price

1355
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:31,120
point for the Platinum Hits, the fourth title is going to be Need for Speed Most Wanted,

1356
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,200
which is why I borrowed that back from you, because I got to beat that to sell it back

1357
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,040
before they drop the price, which is interesting.

1358
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:44,500
And then, what was the other one, I was going to say, oh yeah, they're working on a new

1359
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:50,680
Metal Gear Solid digital comic, based on Metal Gear Solid 2 in Japan, so that would be pretty

1360
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,680
cool.

1361
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:57,840
And, what was the other one, oh, Square's working on Front Mission for the DS, so that

1362
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,600
should be pretty neat.

1363
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,880
I have some news actually for our UK listeners.

1364
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,000
What's that?

1365
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,800
Anyone who is looking for Football Manager 2007, there's a demo being released on Sunday,

1366
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,560
1st October for PC, Mac, and Intel Mac.

1367
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:19,400
To quote on here, the vanilla version will include English and Scottish quick starts,

1368
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:24,360
English language only, with limited assets, logo and player, pictures, etc.

1369
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,360
This will be available from the News of the World website in conjunction with Play.com

1370
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,360
to try and maximize the bandwidth available.

1371
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:38,400
The link to this will of course be on SiGames.com when it's released at midnight.

1372
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:43,800
The Strawberry version, that's kind of funny, will include extra quick starts and extra

1373
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
languages to be confirmed with more assets.

1374
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:52,600
This will be available initially as a torrent only, also at midnight from www.sigames.com.

1375
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,920
So anyone's interested in that?

1376
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:59,680
Speaking of London, or the UK listeners, there's actually going to be a London's Game Festival

1377
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:04,280
kicking off on October 2nd, and it runs through the 7th.

1378
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,040
It's going to be, you know, you're going to be able to play tons of games.

1379
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,720
That's a long festival, five days.

1380
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,840
Oh yeah, you're going to be able to play tons of games at a special set up at Oxford Street's

1381
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:20,040
HMV, plus there's going to be various other events and venues and showcases going on around

1382
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,600
the same time.

1383
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,580
Some other fun things to note, at the Tokyo Game Show they were showing off some different

1384
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:35,560
colored PSPs, one including a camo, as well as red, yellow, and green PSPs, or I'm sorry,

1385
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:43,280
red, blue, and yellow PSPs, all with metallic sheens to them, and another fun one I thought

1386
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,000
of, Devil May Cry, this being made into an anime.

1387
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,600
Should be interesting.

1388
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,720
That should be pretty cool.

1389
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:56,840
All right, well, it's about time we wrap up this program for tonight, and wait until next

1390
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,800
week for more gaming news.

1391
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,720
Let's go around, though, first and get everyone's final thought.

1392
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,800
Drunami, thanks again for being here, as always.

1393
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
What's your final thought?

1394
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
Food.

1395
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,800
All right.

1396
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,040
Loki, your final thought?

1397
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,680
My final thought is, and I forgot to mention, Unreal Tournament 2007 for the PlayStation

1398
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,640
3 will support mods.

1399
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,640
Hot.

1400
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,720
DarkSakura, your final thought?

1401
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,720
Food.

1402
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,740
I've eaten nothing but bagels today.

1403
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:25,080
My final thought is, cookie.

1404
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,080
I did.

1405
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,080
Cookies.

1406
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,080
I brought cookies.

1407
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,080
All right.

1408
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,200
Thank you, guys, so much for tuning into us and supporting independent radio.

1409
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,200
