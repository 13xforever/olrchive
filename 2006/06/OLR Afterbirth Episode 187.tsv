2602	4063	All right, we're going to start tonight's afterbirth.
4183	7024	Nellie, get back in here, Nellie, right now.
8144	13286	Nellie walked in here because she heard the outro going, and she wanted to show Loki what she bought.
13406	14707	What did you get here?
14747	16508	Welcome to the afterbirth, by the way, boys and girls.
16528	17848	This is the Stuff That's Too Hot to Podcast.
18188	19309	What did you get here?
19729	20769	I got a pink helmet.
21129	21490	A pink?
21730	22550	It's a bike helmet.
22670	22950	Yes.
23070	23430	Why?
23951	25011	Because I'm retarded.
26512	28632	And if I fall, I don't want to hurt myself.
29393	31774	You bought a pink bike helmet for no reason?
31954	32294	Yes.
34017	35417	No, I bought it for a reason.
36317	36577	Why?
37378	38138	Hold on, I'll be right back.
38158	40318	I guess they can't see on the radio.
40358	41178	No, they can't see on the radio.
41198	41798	Who cares?
41858	42499	It's the afterbirth.
42539	43279	It's not the real show.
43599	45219	Tell Miklatov he needs to get in here too.
48380	50360	Miklatov is going to make his way back in here too.
50800	52120	You bought roller skates?
52360	55141	Yes, I don't know how to... Hold on, we need to get her on mic.
55161	56021	You bought roller skates?
56741	59181	Yeah, I don't know how to do it, so Christopher was going to teach me.
59482	61742	And he tried to teach me at Target, but I almost fell on him.
62654	65196	I bought knee pads and elbow bobbers.
65216	66877	Christopher made me, I didn't want to.
94072	94992	That's the whole point.
95012	96472	I wanted pillows for my entire body.
97153	98693	I wanted pillows for my entire body.
99614	101194	Because I feel that's the safest.
102335	104015	Anybody want to go rollerblading with me?
104495	104956	I can do that.
104996	105916	I have rollerblades in my car.
106456	107517	Everybody's invited.
108437	109497	The more people to hold me.
110038	114859	Actually, I want to get regular street skates again because I used to have street skates.
114919	116420	I can't use inlines because of my ankle.
117580	119841	Because of an old injury I had to my ankle.
119901	121722	Now they say I can have roller skating sex.
123240	125743	That's, uh... That's not easy.
125943	126724	That's nice.
127044	127725	That's very nice.
128005	128746	Where's Mikotov?
128766	129266	Is he here?
129306	130848	Where the hell is he?
131969	133010	I know he was in the living room.
133110	134972	Is he playing Silent Hill with Annie?
135473	135773	It is.
135893	136554	I'm gonna go get him.
136574	137235	You guys fill time.
137455	138376	That's a natural.
139077	140278	All of these are so photoshopped.
142122	143623	I bought them!
143643	144304	I've read the first one.
165143	166244	She wrote it under a pseudonym.
166284	166904	It's not porno.
167084	167484	It's art.
167544	168125	Erotica.
168305	169586	Miklatov was supposed to come on.
169606	170146	It's erotica.
170346	170626	Yes.
171227	175549	Miklatov was supposed to come on and yell at people who didn't like Bomani in the U.S., but he pussied out.
176230	177590	So forget what I said in chat.
177610	178071	Sorry, guys.
179031	179752	Not my fault, though.
181573	183154	My name's Miklatov, and I'm a big chicken.
184234	184514	All right.
184615	186035	Do you want to do Ask Nelly?
186916	187496	All right, fine.
187556	189698	And you field the questions while I set up Cage Match here.
190758	192019	Feel free to ask questions.
194921	195081	Go.
196222	196402	Now.
197102	197823	Ask questions.
198123	199184	This is a new segment.
199284	200044	Ask Nellie a question.
200064	200965	Let's ask Nellie questions.
203107	204928	You guys ask me questions.
204948	205989	Nellie, do you like your books?
206809	206989	Yes.
207209	207890	Wait, here.
207930	209151	You can borrow my mic while I set up the kitchen.
209171	210412	Yes, I love books.
213499	213699	What?
214059	214860	Other than what?
215080	216961	Didn't, didn't, here, just take my mic.
217302	217542	No.
218442	219703	You didn't play any other video games?
219883	220164	No.
220924	222085	I don't play video games.
222565	223786	I thought you played Tetris a little bit.
224867	226468	Yes, I played Tetris a little bit.
227629	227849	Okay.
228189	230050	But you got to level 16 on Bejeweled?
230471	233112	I know, and 17 is the achievement, and I lost.
233213	235854	Yes, why didn't you earn me my damn achievement?
235994	236775	That's why I need the helmet.
236795	237035	Work!
237375	239217	What do I... Because he beats me.
240137	242319	Seriously, if... Please help if he can't.
244008	244329	I don't know.
246959	247902	There were no questions.
248363	250130	What did you have for dinner, Nellie?
250965	254847	I had one of those Frascata sandwiches from Wendy's.
254987	263971	It was the turkey and Swiss, and I got it with no mayo, and I got a side salad with low-fat honey mustard dressing and a Diet Coke.
265072	268013	And then Christopher just gave me an apple, because he's awesome.
268033	271835	Whoever asked the question, says Nat.
271875	275156	The other question was, have you ever gone skydiving, which I know is no.
275176	276957	Don't ask that question for me.
277277	278258	You don't speak for me.
280114	281034	You should have a brownie bite.
281314	282935	Where did the bad man touch you?
284695	285335	Everywhere.
286295	287016	That's about right.
287836	290016	I eat whatever the crap I want diet now.
290356	292057	Nellie, what is your opinion on boobs?
292857	293657	I love boobs.
293957	295317	You know whose boobs I really like?
295937	296878	Jessica Alba's.
298318	300578	She has a no nudity clause and that really sucks.
300598	301819	That's because she's a biznatch.
303839	305540	But I don't like, what's her face?
305820	307300	The redhead with the freckles.
309784	313945	Lindsay Lohan, yes, because her nipple is on top, and that's just not right.
314645	315925	It's like on the top of the boob.
316025	319806	She was cuter when she, you know, more chubby and with the red hair.
319926	322647	When she was a child, because you're a molester.
322667	324527	I'm not a child molester.
324547	325768	Lester the molester.
326348	327728	She's now like anorexic.
328508	330849	And Vilmar, you know, stupid.
330949	331489	Please don't joke.
332874	335835	Please don't joke about child molesting, not after the trial I went through this week.
336955	343738	Especially about Wilmer Valderrama.
343818	352540	He has a show on MTV called Yo Mama, to which I said, God damn it, you ripped that off of In Living Color.
352920	357262	And the fact that he's producing this show, he's like, this is my greatest idea ever.
358302	361985	It's a dumb show to begin with, yet for some reason I watched the final today.
362525	370430	The best trash talker in LA and some retarded white guy who thinks he's black or something.
370450	379056	The funniest part of that show was that the white guy got $5,000 in cash and he was surrounded by a bunch of blacks and Mexicans.
379096	380237	I'm like, he's not going to keep that.
380457	381298	He's going to get mugged.
382022	384263	because they're all behind him looking at him hatefully.
386663	388444	I smell hate crime.
393065	393965	We had to do the cage match.
393985	395265	You want to sit in on the cage match tonight?
395645	397266	No, I'm going to go play with my new toys.
397286	398406	All right, have fun with your new toys.
398446	399406	Thanks for coming on the show, Nellie.
399446	399967	We appreciate it.
400007	400967	Thanks for having me.
400987	401387	You're welcome.
401407	402167	Bye, everybody.
402807	404208	All right, here we go.
404328	405468	Orange launch into the cage match.
407220	408262	Thanks for watching!
427463	428363	Thank you for watching!
448638	450839	Anyway, let's get into tonight's cage match.
450879	454559	Song number one was last week's winner, and it comes to us from a little band.
454599	455680	You might have heard of it before.
456180	459260	Not because Jamie doesn't talk about it every week on the show or anything like that.
459621	461061	Hey, I don't.
461101	461641	Well, it's true.
462281	462901	Every other show.
462961	463541	Every other show.
463561	464122	All right, here it is.
464602	465202	You voted it.
465322	465662	It won.
465702	467162	Here's a clip of last week's winner.
467242	470323	Song number one, The Gorillas, Happy Landfill.
575297	579118	Alrighty, so song number one, Gorillas with Happy Landfill.
579158	584800	It must successfully beat two new songs to a bloody pulp, and that first song is going to come from Loki.
584960	586000	What is your pick tonight?
586220	591842	My song is from Junkie XL again, but this time it's a collaboration with somebody else.
593783	596224	It's actually pretty cool.
596244	598964	It's called Nightmare, or Nightmares, I believe.
599465	603266	And, well, yeah, it's short, so that's always good.
603786	604446	Nightmares Featuring Infusion
721390	722454	Thank you for watching!
794515	800716	From the start it's easy to get lost in the darkness Darkness Darkness Darkness Darkness
834122	835903	I kinda dig that one.
836043	840625	I mean, it was a little repetitive, I think, to get a full ten from, but it gets loose to nine.
840665	840985	It's short.
841005	843387	It's like three minutes, which is awesome.
843407	844447	That's very good for you, Loki.
856573	878391	Hey, I tried, um, it's, I don't know, this was like one of the only songs I liked on this album, and this album actually, it was like, um, Junkie XL, or JXL Radio from, um, the Computer Hell Cabin or something like that, which is a weird name, but, uh, it was one of the tracks on there, and, I don't know, it was the only one I liked, so, I give it a 9.
878591	880613	Alright.
880633	881454	Uh, time for my song.
882930	885772	and what nerd doesn't love our next artist?
885812	889355	And it's been far too long since this person has released a song.
889956	894620	But this guy put up this song on his website this last week saying, hey, I'm not dead.
895140	896181	Here's a brand new song.
896621	898303	And I said, that's great.
898843	900144	I'm going to put it in the cage match.
900184	904167	So here it is, Weird Al Yankovic with You're Pitiful.
904688	905028	Enjoy.
920000	946752	My life is brilliant My life is brilliant Your life's a joke You're just pathetic You're always broke Your homemade Star Trek uniform Really ain't impressing me
948140	975927	You're suffering from delusions of adequacy You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true Never had a date that you couldn't inflate And you smell repulsive too
978240	1001708	What a bummer being you Well you just can't dance And forget romance Everybody you know still calls you
1002836	1025176	Farty Pants, but you'll always have a job Well, I mean, as long as you still can work that slurpy machine You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true
1027805	1056580	You're half undressed Eating chips off your chest While you're playing Halo 2 No one's classier than you La la la la La la la la La la la la Loser
1058948	1078647	You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true Your dog would much rather play fetch by itself You still live with your mom when you're 42
1087072	1109182	All right, song number three in tonight's cage match, Weird Al Yankovic with Your Pitiful.
1109662	1111924	Was that song pitiful or magnificent, DarkSakura?
1112004	1112664	Eleventy million.
1113024	1114605	Eleventy million from DarkSakura.
1115632	1116853	Gorillaz, Happy Landfill
1146025	1150586	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Junkie XL with Nightmares featuring Infusion.
1157228	1161710	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Weird Al Yankovic with Your Pitiful.
1162790	1169772	Everybody you know still calls you farty pants, but you won't.
1170695	1172759	All right, place vote now.
1172839	1175964	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1175984	1178989	We'll tally them up, and we'll see who the wiener is.
1179870	1184037	And I think I just heard DarkSakura say, I hope I lose.
1184578	1185119	That's amazing.
1185697	1187138	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1210566	1216191	I've basically just, since you just put that up there, I've basically linked it to like seven people just now.
1216792	1217853	A new song, really?
1217933	1218593	Download this!
1219214	1219854	That's great!
1220984	1221564	Well, we'll see.
1221644	1222024	We'll see.
1222585	1225526	There seems to be some anti-Weird Al people in our chat room, so I don't know.
1225566	1229187	I forgot to mention, and I just saw this thing on IGN.
1229207	1230408	Tell us about it.
1230428	1232749	That's good, because I can tally votes when I do that.
1232789	1235390	Hurry up and get your votes in now, because we don't have time.
1236630	1244693	I actually have in my possession, and this is such a nerd of me, and we talked about this a while ago, that they were getting sent out.
1246034	1248415	I have my Xbox Live Diamond card.
1250188	1251029	Aren't you special?
1251749	1253771	Great, now what the fuck can you do with it?
1254071	1254491	I don't know.
1255312	1256152	Impale people in the head!
1256172	1259214	I can show people that I'm a member of Xbox Live!
1259735	1260415	Mwah!
1261356	1262837	Expires May 2007.
1262917	1263718	Yeah.
1266399	1266720	I don't know.
1267560	1268381	I just thought I'd show that.
1269261	1270782	You can stab people in the head with it.
1272564	1274925	Or give them evil paper cuts with your plastic card.
1275106	1277027	Can't really give paper cuts with this, it's not sharp.
1278237	1280819	I don't know, you catch them just the right way on the edge, then you know, hey.
1281279	1283340	But this is my nerd certification card.
1285161	1285461	I don't know.
1286062	1290984	I would just like to point out, there are more votes in cage match tonight than I have ever seen in the four year history of this show.
1291525	1292205	It's crazy.
1292305	1293846	I'm having a hard time tallying this up.
1293866	1294987	You guys need to fill more time.
1298028	1298509	Anywho.
1299970	1300810	You know what I have?
1302311	1302471	What?
1302981	1308866	Air, a whole lot of it, especially dead air like we're having on the show just to write about, you know, before I said something.
1311068	1312729	Actually, I actually did some purchasing today.
1312990	1323339	My X-Men fandom has resurged like massively, so I picked up one of the new X-Men graphic novels, except I need to go back and pick up the Astonishing X-Men one because they're written by Joss Whedon.
1324019	1328161	who we all know is the god of sci-fi for giving us Firefly.
1328801	1331423	Joss Whedon is my master now.
1331963	1335785	But I think it's funny because he writes like Shadowcat perfectly and he based Buffy off of her.
1335805	1336625	I think that's fantastic.
1337225	1338806	Yeah, I'm a big, big nerd.
1338866	1339286	So what?
1340067	1340747	I love X-Men.
1343128	1343368	Wow.
1343528	1350852	There's actually a lot of businesses that support the Xbox Live Diamond Card and they have a whole list of them including...
1351826	1353968	was a Hollywood Video Ace Hardware.
1356009	1361974	There's actually some local businesses for at least me, like the El Dorado Hills Auto Care.
1363736	1364957	Mind, Body, and Harmony.
1364977	1365957	What the fuck?
1366958	1367679	That's weird.
1369981	1371762	Alright, I got all the votes tallied up whenever you guys are ready.
1372703	1373223	That was hard.
1374324	1378307	Dave and Busters, you can get $10 free gameplay with live.
1378327	1379168	Ooh, now that's kind of cool.
1380069	1381270	Yeah, I like that idea.
1382318	1382618	All right.
1383319	1385261	You guys ready to hear tonight's cage match winner?
1385601	1385941	Yo.
1386422	1389965	Just to give you an idea of how many votes we got tonight.
1390045	1390965	Sweet crap.
1391025	1392867	Look how far the stars go out there.
1392967	1393468	Look at that.
1394128	1398111	One song just took the other two out in the field and beat them senseless.
1398171	1399332	I mean, seriously.
1399633	1401374	I am sorry to say.
1402375	1403775	that I whooped you both tonight.
1404156	1406276	I don't care, I wanted you to.
1406576	1408477	In that way, I'm a winner too.
1408537	1411898	Weird Al just swept the vote tonight.
1412158	1416739	Now, not to say song one and two weren't completely unloved, because they did get quite a few votes.
1417079	1422481	In probably a normal week, song one or two might have won it, but you guys were nuts tonight.
1422521	1423721	We loved the participation tonight.
1423761	1427322	Loki, Xbox Live Diamond Card, the Pez Museum.
1428022	1430083	Buy one in Mission, get the second free.
1431329	1431429	Eh?
1431809	1432130	Pez?
1432290	1433090	You're a fan of Pez.
1433450	1434051	I used to be.
1434091	1436372	I used to collect Pez dispensers a long, long time ago.
1436392	1436872	I bought you some.
1436912	1437893	I got you a Wonder Woman one.
1438053	1438693	I know.
1438733	1439774	And they're all sitting in a drawer.
1441119	1441239	Aw.
1441279	1444120	But, hey, that way the sunlight doesn't damage them and they don't get dust.
1444701	1446381	So someday I'll take them out and display them.
1446641	1446861	I know.
1447101	1449782	When I have a house, that's my, that's my old fallback.
1449802	1450543	When I have a house.
1450803	1457525	You know, ironically enough, all this stuff that's, you know, that these services are, they're all, like, local to us.
1457946	1461867	Like, Dublin, they have one in Dublin, California that's, uh, walks up.
1462347	1464268	You receive 20% off your entire bill.
1464428	1466329	Is it because you put in your zip code before you went into that site?
1467006	1476474	No, well maybe under my membership information or something like that, but I'm just surprised that they have these small ass companies that are on here.
1476655	1491968	I mean, I would think they'd just be big name companies and stuff, but there's like Omaha Steaks, they have 1-800-PetMeds.com, Doggy Daycare, there's some weird stuff on here, but I don't know, it's kind of neat.
1494685	1499347	We gotta get to chatroom FUs tonight, kids, because I know a lot of you guys have chatroom FUs.
1500107	1501748	So I want to get to those.
1503068	1503248	What?
1503308	1504048	Why did I share what?
1504669	1506309	I'm going through the shared folders.
1506349	1509590	Why are you... She's looking for the porn is what she's doing.
1509730	1512211	I'm like, why did you share PaintShop Pro?
1512231	1516553	Probably so I could do it on... Probably if I shared something really random, it was probably so I could get it up on Christopher's computer.
1517073	1519754	GameStop.com PaintShop Pro 4 for life.
1520356	1521016	Dude, no way.
1521617	1525359	You know how I was all, Photoshop sucks, Photoshop sucks, Photoshop sucks.
1525480	1526780	And then I used Photoshop CS.
1527081	1528362	And I was like, PaintShop Pro sucks.
1530583	1534246	Especially since PaintShop Pro doesn't recognize the angle sensitivity on my tablet.
1534546	1537928	Yeah, but for people who can't draw like me, PaintShop Pro 4 is awesome.
1538148	1538869	Stick figures, yo.
1539329	1544013	Alright, I could make a dancing graphic like Jeremy Todd did, probably.
1544813	1547095	Actually, sadly, my artistic talent won't even do that.
1547355	1561986	Loki, you want to get one more thought out there before I... Oh, I was just going to say, GameStop.com, if you use online site, if you purchase something over $75, you get $10 off with the card, or pretty much if you just enter in promotional code DIAMONDS.
1563126	1565528	So, there you go, big secret right there.
1565628	1566469	Oh no, whoo!
1567609	1572892	Nintendo Maniac 64 is the first in chatroom to say MS Paint for the win.
1573052	1574713	I've done touch-ups in Paint.
1574813	1576554	I use MS Paint at work all the time.
1576874	1577855	It's great for screenshots.
1577955	1579436	I have begged and begged and begged.
1579616	1583718	Look, if I'm doing all this crap for you, just give me Photoshop so I don't have to bring my laptop up here to do our flyers.
1584439	1589701	And so I actually use Microsoft Photo Editor and Paint.
1590202	1592503	I will website edit in Notepad for life.
1594024	1594884	Notepad is awesome.
1594944	1596225	Chatroom FUs, boys and girls.
1599017	1601701	And we're gonna start it off with MacMan!
1602382	1605026	My FU is to Apple, my favorite goddamn company.
1605066	1606548	They better not buy Nintendo.
1606568	1607470	They will kill them.
1607890	1610334	The Bandai Pin Pin 2 is not a good idea.
1611618	1612319	Don't worry, Macman.
1612359	1613700	It's just dirty rumors from fanboys.
1614241	1618526	NintendoManiac64 says, F you to the chatroom for not answering my question after asking twice.
1618586	1620688	So I'm asking you people at OLR.
1621149	1624032	What is the fastest Wipeout and Extreme G game?
1624393	1629979	I have F-Zero GX and beat all cups on Master and completed Story Mode and several chapters on Very Hard 2.
1630039	1630459	Thank you.
1630700	1632362	I defer to Loki because I don't play Wipeout.
1635284	1640506	I like Wipeout 3 and Wipeout Pure is pretty good, but those are the latest ones.
1640706	1642866	Well, that explains why no one answered your question.
1643126	1646007	Nobody played the damn game.
1646027	1649228	Well, I'm not sure if this was a very fast game.
1649268	1654829	I remember that Fatal Inertia was supposed to be pretty good on the PS3, but I heard that that game seemed kind of slow.
1655089	1660070	I would just wait for Wipeout on the PS3 to come out, because that's probably going to be the fastest one.
1661737	1662177	Hey!
1663678	1665039	No, I just found your photo.
1665759	1666660	You found my porn?
1666680	1667120	Did you really?
1667140	1667901	No, I found your photo.
1668141	1668261	Oh.
1669082	1669542	God.
1669562	1671023	Well, they're probably in there somewhere.
1671043	1672924	Stop looking for my porn!
1673104	1673485	Stop it!
1674025	1677167	You can buy a dozen of Krispy Kreme donuts.
1677247	1680489	Okay, I swear to God we're going to be here until midnight if I don't get moving, people.
1680570	1680930	Alright.
1681330	1683331	DarkLionXVI wants to... Now I found it.
1683552	1683772	Sorry.
1684192	1688135	DarkLion wants to say, hey, I play Wipeout, so enjoy.
1688155	1688235	Okay.
1690076	1691657	You found Loki's porn or my porn?
1692557	1693418	I don't have porn.
1693638	1694338	And I'm not shared.
1694559	1695379	No, you know who that is?
1695519	1695879	X-Verse.
1698661	1702263	I found X-Verse porn.
1702663	1703344	He shares it?
1704144	1704805	I guess so.
1706621	1708742	Alright, come on, I gotta get through this.
1708803	1710924	BlackWolf says F you to Jesper.
1711524	1711945	Well said.
1712345	1714847	JeremyTodd1 says F you to Loki for no apparent reason.
1715847	1718829	F you my car for having shitty brakes right now so I have to go get them fixed.
1719270	1721631	F you to myself for not having a podcast again this week.
1721711	1723132	Damn work is making me too busy.
1723673	1725114	I was supposed to be on his podcast, but...
1726297	1728538	I'm traveling next week anyway, so we might have to reschedule.
1728659	1731260	It just kind of came to my mind.
1731540	1733902	DJ Tyrant says, F you to work and feeling sick.
1733922	1738245	F you to having to sleep and getting a new job that requires me to actually get up early.
1740266	1745049	Bandit says, I want to send a big F you to the Dallas Mavericks for thinking that they can actually beat the Miami Heat.
1746250	1752714	Hitstun would like to say, fuck you to Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection for not letting the four of us Mario Kart DS players in chat connect and play a game.
1753034	1754155	Dropping players and shit.
1755066	1758428	DMN would like to say F you to any person under 16 who plays Gunbound.
1758768	1765311	Half of you son of bitches act like you just discovered the internet and the other half think you are so fucking cool for taking a goddamn computer game like it's serious business.
1765692	1767032	I hope you all die in a fire.
1767352	1768033	Heart, DMN.
1770142	1774265	Fireboma says, F you to Belmont Park for taking $34 of my money.
1774345	1775305	Go, horsies, go.
1776326	1783230	The Ichiban Crush says, F you to the bad rental skates I were given that utterly destroyed my feet when I went ice skating yesterday.
1783250	1784591	I want to go ice skating.
1785071	1787552	Funnydale says, F you to old people winning the lottery.
1787592	1790354	There should be an age limit to how old you can be to win the damn lottery.
1790674	1793636	Winning the lottery when you are 90 is like a blind person buying a car.
1795717	1797037	Maybe they're going to give the money to their kids.
1797297	1804079	DJ PooEater says, F you to the electric company for not supplying us with individual generators because we had a blackout and I missed the entire Orange Launch Radio show.
1804459	1808420	Now I must listen to podcasts and explain it to all the bastards who ask, what are you listening to?
1808720	1810060	And they look at me like I'm stupid.
1810420	1813201	I hate the world, but I less than three OLR.
1814121	1816722	I think he means he hates the world, but not us.
1818122	1821663	Raven Stolpen says, F you Nintendo for making Apple-inspired Nintendo DS Lite.
1822523	1827105	Dark Knight says, my FU goes to me ending up being broke from the anime convention this weekend, but it was well worth it.
1828186	1839111	Anush says, FU, how in the I-405 when you're traveling at 75 already, you get past like you're standing still, and once you're in the carpool lane, you're forced to go 120 miles an hour.
1839392	1841032	That's what I'm wondering, hello.
1842473	1849777	Arimasen says, FU to the hot weather and making me unable to fast combo on poppin' music, my sticky hands sticking to the buttons.
1850285	1851506	I have a question for RMSN.
1851606	1851826	Yes.
1852286	1853567	Why does your name does not have?
1853587	1856568	I don't know.
1856588	1861231	23rdMagazine says, F you to Hordeside Altric Valley groups on Malstorm.
1861611	1863732	Organizing 40 people is like herding cats.
1863812	1865233	Three-legged dyslexic cats.
1865773	1868334	F you to my computer locking up randomly whenever I play games.
1868515	1872817	F you to whatever fucknugget thought the second half of Tales of Legendia didn't need voice acting.
1874506	1880369	SSJ100 Matt says F you to high schoolers and middle schoolers invading all the malls, movie theaters, and arcade because they're off for the summer.
1880429	1881470	Get jobs, dammit!
1882210	1887013	And SSJ100 Matt continues F you to A-Rod Slump and F you to Kutaragi for not shutting the fuck up.
1887874	1889875	Blaze says my F you is to my new boss.
1890035	1890595	She is a bitch.
1890775	1891876	You better hope she doesn't listen to this show.
1892436	1910761	Xander K says F you to Microsoft for not putting Conker in the latest release of backward compatibility Legend of Zaku says F you to my college for being the dicks that they are billing me and everyone in my apartment complex almost $1.50 each for community damages that I didn't do Dark Tetsuya says F you to Sky who forgot he owed me a cage match pick get over it
1911121	1921309	Sephiroth 1215 says, F you to Poor Designs and Anime Next, a con, with an extremely small game room where the same people sit there and won't leave the games, especially the DDR machine and 2DX.
1921790	1924692	Also, there was no room for the video room, so I couldn't see the movies.
1926574	1931237	Bandit says, F you to the furry convention that was held in Pittsburgh this past weekend.
1931958	1935481	Another F you to Raven's Dolphin for hating the Miami Heat, says Bandit.
1935581	1936722	Ooh, snap, we got a...
1938325	1940327	Okay, we are not having freaking sports chat.
1940367	1941368	Last FU.
1941969	1946634	JeremyTodd1 says FU Raven's Dolphin for making that FU because the DS Lite is sexy.
1949605	1950206	That's it, kids.
1950266	1950846	We gotta go.
1951006	1951667	I love my DSR.
1951727	1954609	We gotta wrap it up and get out of here because... We're hungry.
1954769	1955930	We have business to tend to.
1956411	1957191	No, I'm not hungry.
1957371	1958632	There's stuff to be done.
1959313	1962836	Macman sent me a private message saying, you have PC porn, you know you love it.
1963296	1965098	I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean, but okay.
1966179	1974746	Because he's Macman, and you have this reputation on Orange Launch Radio for not liking Mac, so... Okay, I am completely annoyed of those stupid Apple commercials where they have...
1975146	1977028	Apple Guy and PC Guy.
1977248	1978489	Hi, I'm a Mac, I'm a PC.
1978849	1979970	Yeah, no.
1980871	1989878	Oh, yeah, PCs are constantly... Yeah, my PC must be constantly rebooting during this show because, yeah, I'm never... I can't get anything done.
1989938	1991679	Okay, I'll tell you this much.
1991919	1992780	You know I love Apple.
1992940	1993440	I really do.
1993581	1997684	But I kind of agree with that because I've been using this computer for I don't know how many years.
1997724	1998785	I've never gotten a virus, ever.
1999185	1999345	Ever.
2000286	2000306	I...
2001639	2002500	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2024355	2025716	The world hangs on the bones.
2025736	2028378	Because secretly DarkSakura and I are going to murder Loki tonight.
2028478	2029839	And then that will change the future of our video.
2029939	2032040	It's not so much of a secret if you tell him.
2032100	2032420	Sorry.
2032720	2033721	Sorry, we're not going to kill you.
2033761	2036143	We're going to feed you pie.
2036163	2037984	I don't like pie.
2038404	2040545	Or donuts with white frosting on them.
2040585	2044948	Perhaps this song will fit Loki after tonight's staff meeting.
2044988	2046789	And it's our fortune cookie message of the day.
2047310	2047590	Enjoy.
2053018	2060126	Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave because I go berserk?
2061008	2069277	Well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind.
2070219	2085400	And, they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha, to the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time, and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha ha!
2088757	2097100	I thought it was a joke and so you laughed, you laughed when I had said that losing you would make me flip my lid, right?
2097540	2111865	You know you laughed, I heard you laugh, you laughed, you laughed and laughed and then you left, but now you know I'm utterly mad And they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha
2113166	2131538	I cooked your food, I cleaned your house, and this is how you pay me back for all my kind, unselfish, loving deeds.
2132179	2132719	Huh?
2133219	2134220	Well, you just wait.
2134320	2140685	They'll find you yet, and when they do, they'll put you in the ASPCA, you mangy mutt.
2142526	2166865	They're coming to take me away, ha-ha They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats And they're coming to take me away, ha-ha To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds And basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes And they're coming to take me away
2170555	2171778	Thanks for watching!
2181638	2181858	Hi!
2182158	2182779	We're not dead.
2182819	2185941	Sorry, I was just having printer drama.
2186661	2187221	Printer drama!
2188142	2188782	That's it, guys.
2188902	2191224	Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting Independent Radio.
2191264	2194786	You know we love you, staying up late, especially you crazy kids in the UK.
2194846	2195986	Actually, I think he finally went to bed.
2196807	2198468	But thank you guys still so much for listening.
2199268	2202110	We appreciate you, and we'll see you next week, alright?
2202170	2203771	Our next live program is Tuesday night.
2203831	2205412	It's DarkSakura's Pump Up the Volume.
2206192	2210775	Wednesday night, there will be no live program because I will be in LA on a business trip.
2211175	2215437	So you can try allgames.com instead because if I can, I'm going to make a cameo over there.
2216237	2221740	Otherwise, you'll just have to listen to Jamie's show on Tuesday and our next live show on Sunday.
2221900	2222340	Sound good?
2223020	2223401	Alrighty.
2223641	2224281	Have a great week.
2226102	2228503	Oh, reconnect to the station in 15 seconds for more video game music.
