1
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright kids, we're getting back here for Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.

2
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,292
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the part of the show that's too hot for podcasting.

3
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:32,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scandalous stuff.

4
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:34,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this whole room smells like Italian food.

5
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:34,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that out of here.

6
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:36,854
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than rotting milk.

7
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop putting that... Nelly?

8
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:43,436
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it from the... Yeah, from the three McFlurries.

9
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill your rotten milk cup away.

10
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:47,297
[SPEAKER_01]: For me?

11
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:48,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I have a breadstick?

12
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:48,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

13
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:53,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Three McFlurries and they're all rotting.

14
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:54,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want a breadstick?

15
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:55,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

16
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:57,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the breadstick.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Food from Olive Garden.

18
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:04,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Nellie.

19
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:05,714
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very kind of you.

20
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:06,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

21
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:06,714
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

22
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I have another bag.

23
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,277
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go to Lion's.

24
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:09,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday!

25
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:13,899
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get like three bags of bread from Olive Garden?

26
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:21,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I only have two bags because one of the bags was the leftovers from what was on the table and then I got Matt's dinner to go and that came with four breadsticks.

27
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

28
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It's her birthday today, by the way.

29
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, Nellie!

30
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:25,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to spank her live on air?

31
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:27,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

32
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:27,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Nellie's bending over.

33
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:28,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Spank her!

34
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:28,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

35
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:33,884
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you do for your birthday, Nellie?

36
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:36,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, get her mic.

37
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:36,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Get her mic.

38
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, stop spanking her.

39
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:42,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Get her out of my way.

40
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:43,318
[SPEAKER_01]: What did Nellie do today?

41
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:49,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt took me out to breakfast, and then we went to my mom's house, and I had cake there.

42
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I came here, and we went to the Olive Garden.

43
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:54,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, I ate all day.

44
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,983
[SPEAKER_07]: And yesterday... I know, it's delicious.

45
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:59,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate all weekend, actually.

46
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:02,144
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to Joe's Crab Shack yesterday.

47
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:05,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I got barbecue crab, and I highly recommend it.

48
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:09,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing, because my friends don't like me.

49
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:10,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I like you.

50
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:11,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, you didn't do anything.

51
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:13,950
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

52
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hurt.

53
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't do anything for your birthday either.

54
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have a party.

55
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:20,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take you on a shopping spree at Walmart.

56
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:23,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's my favorite store.

57
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Ew, Target's way better.

58
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:27,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys, I'm eating.

59
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:31,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're supposed to be doing a radio program here, but now the podcast is over, I don't care.

60
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:32,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast is the important show.

61
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:34,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, one of our listeners has a question.

62
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:34,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what?

63
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about if you can play the wave bird on the Wii.

64
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:41,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, find out when it comes out.

65
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the port things aren't the right size.

66
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:46,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they are, no.

67
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:47,253
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to.

68
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:48,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

69
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,053
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

70
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,234
[SPEAKER_04]: This Jeremy Todd one.

71
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:58,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm eating an Olive Garden breadstick and enjoying the breadsticky goodness.

72
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking for the remote control?

73
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out there somewhere and the damn thing keeps getting lost.

74
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Look in the couch cushions.

75
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:08,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had today three... Wait, make Annie come in here.

76
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:09,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Annie on the show.

77
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:16,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had today three small whole wheat pitas with baba ganoush, which is basically eggplant dip.

78
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:21,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a small piece of 85% dark chocolate and four Ritz crackers.

79
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:26,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Silent Hill 1, The Old School Yes

80
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,900
[SPEAKER_01]: and why did you decide to start playing Silent Hill?

81
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Shane bought it.

82
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane bought it?

83
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,142
[SPEAKER_00]: No, brought it.

84
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you... Oh, he's not here.

85
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:03,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Miklatov is how our listeners know him, but that's alright.

86
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that how they know you?

87
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was supposed to watch.

88
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:13,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to play through this time.

89
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,482
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the experience would be so much better if I played because I always think that it's not scary whenever he plays.

90
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:16,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some.

91
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a lot of Pump It Up lately.

92
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:18,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yay!

93
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:38,915
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

94
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,197
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.

95
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you ever played a lot of scary games before?

96
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:44,199
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

97
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:44,740
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

98
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like the first scary game you were playing?

99
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:48,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it terrified me to everything.

100
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:52,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really, you were the one coming in every once in a while going, you're screaming again.

101
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:57,770
[SPEAKER_01]: No, let me do my impression of Annie playing Silent Hill, is that every five seconds you're like, oh my god!

102
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:21,800
[SPEAKER_01]: and then like you hear like 60 gunshots and then she's on my bullet is it dead because she's not even looking at the screen she starts screaming i know i held out the controller and closed my eyes so for those people that say a video game can't be scary what would you what would be your response it can as long as you're the one playing it yeah what makes it more scary when you're the one playing it

103
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to play through three.

104
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:46,738
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 is my favorite.

105
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:47,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

106
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:48,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

107
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:49,279
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

108
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the worst one.

109
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,502
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 is my favorite because of Heza Beam.

110
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:54,682
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

111
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Heather.

112
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,825
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a special beam power.

113
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,866
[SPEAKER_04]: She has the sexy beam.

114
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,328
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she has Heather Beam the first time around and then she gets sexy beam.

115
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,790
[SPEAKER_04]: She has Heather Beam and sexy beam.

116
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:09,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And I prefer Heather Beam.

117
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:10,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's Heza Beam.

118
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:11,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Heza...

119
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:14,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you on my game because I'm cheating.

120
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:15,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cheating?

121
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:16,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cheating hardcore.

122
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:18,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

123
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:19,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got all items, all maps.

124
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you cheat through Silent Hill?

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,781
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.

126
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you did?

127
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:25,803
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because we were so lost at the end of it.

128
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:26,583
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what to do.

129
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:27,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you went on GameFAQs.

130
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:28,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

131
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,587
[SPEAKER_04]: My idea of cheating is putting in a game shark.

132
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:35,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Using codes, like up, up, down, down, left, right type thing.

133
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm only playing it for the story.

134
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:39,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we only did it for figuring out things.

135
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:45,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to play any other scary games like Resident Evil, Siren, anything else?

136
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really too familiar.

137
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,138
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say is your favorite video game?

138
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably Silent Hill now.

139
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.

140
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.

141
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,481
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun.

142
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,702
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your favorite video game before yesterday?

143
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:04,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say Kingdom Hearts, but it hasn't really been my favorite for a while now.

144
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's getting, you know, kind of boring.

145
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:08,345
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.

146
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:12,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened up the chat room if anybody wanted to ask Annie a question.

147
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:13,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some questions from the chat.

148
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:15,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

149
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:18,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy Todd wants to know, does she like bacon?

150
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:19,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

151
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:21,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.

152
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:22,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

153
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:27,850
[SPEAKER_01]: VXJasonXV wants to know if you've ever played a game called Fatal Frame.

154
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

155
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:36,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we were a TV show because she's saying, of course, she's shaking her head.

156
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,710
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to lie to the listeners just to be cool.

157
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:40,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be cool.

158
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:41,772
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

159
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:42,733
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

160
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:45,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these questions are inappropriate.

161
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:46,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're getting inappropriate.

162
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Now DMM wants to know if you're single.

163
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:49,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

164
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:50,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.

165
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:51,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.

166
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to know if you like dark meat.

167
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,262
[SPEAKER_00]: If I like dark meats, like on a turkey or something?

168
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:58,862
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.

169
00:07:59,082 --> 00:07:59,342
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

170
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:01,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

171
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:03,886
[SPEAKER_00]: No comments.

172
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:06,068
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's right.

173
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:06,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't acknowledge that.

174
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,989
[SPEAKER_01]: That's trash.

175
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't acknowledge that trash.

176
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:15,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And she might be single, boys, but she's always going to be together with Jesus Christ and not with any of you.

177
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,217
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know what?

178
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Buzz off.

179
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm married to Jesus.

180
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,103
[SPEAKER_01]: God, you guys ask some lame questions here.

181
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I ask some good ones.

182
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, paper or plastic?

183
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, paper all the way.

184
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:37,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, lastly, Jeremy Todd 1 wants to know, what size are your shoes?

185
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think seven and a half.

186
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:42,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that important?

187
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:43,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

188
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:48,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say no more questions for Annie.

189
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:50,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, here's a good one.

190
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let this go.

191
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:52,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good question.

192
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:55,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Ranma wants to know, PSP or DS?

193
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:56,007
[SPEAKER_00]: DS.

194
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:56,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

195
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:58,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so great.

196
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,871
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love Tetris.

197
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:01,971
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it so much.

198
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:04,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever played Luminous on the PSP?

199
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:04,673
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

200
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:06,174
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.

201
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:06,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.

202
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:07,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.

203
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:07,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

204
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, fair enough.

205
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:10,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming on the show, Annie.

206
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:11,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Last minute, I appreciate it.

207
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:12,281
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

208
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick around if you want, but otherwise, we're gonna... I'm gonna go, bye.

209
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:16,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's fine.

210
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,530
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a good sport, ladies and gentlemen.

211
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,354
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, by the way, just to make the chat room shut up.

212
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:23,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Bacon!

213
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

214
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,621
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

215
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:51,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like bringing up the sliced off fat of a dead pig that people eat.

216
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nasty.

217
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sporting my I Love Bacon shirt.

218
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,183
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's delicious is veal.

219
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:02,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Mmm, baby cow.

220
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:02,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.

221
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:07,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about your sister tonight.

222
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:07,848
[SPEAKER_01]: We're done with you.

223
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:08,829
[SPEAKER_01]: The meat's so tender.

224
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,572
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a meat-eater, though, I was fond of lamb.

225
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have such a thing as, like, baby pig?

226
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:16,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can you get, like, baby pig and bacon?

227
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:20,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I want to get to the cage match, boys and girls, because I'm retiring tonight.

228
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:23,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we are going to retire your song?

229
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:24,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's been in rotation for four weeks.

230
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:24,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it?

231
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:25,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was three.

232
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:26,206
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

233
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

234
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,387
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while anyways.

235
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:28,907
[SPEAKER_01]: People forgot.

236
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:31,268
[SPEAKER_01]: But just so you guys know, here it is.

237
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,469
[SPEAKER_01]: It's officially being retired from the cage match.

238
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot Topic is not punk rock.

239
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:35,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a clip.

240
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:37,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Topic is not punk rock.

241
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:38,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Topic is not punk rock.

242
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,051
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that song gets retired.

243
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,373
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been officially played in Hot Topic now.

244
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:04,557
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't win four times, but because of E3 and Faname, it just kind of stuck around for four weeks.

245
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:05,077
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of sick of it.

246
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:05,618
[SPEAKER_01]: It snuck by.

247
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,541
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so DarkSakura's going to put a new song in tonight's cage match, so here we go with tonight's cage match.

248
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's horrible.

249
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:12,222
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, hold on.

250
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:12,783
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet.

251
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:18,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have to remind the folks who are listening, you have to be in the chat room to participate in...

252
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:24,031
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura has song... Wait, no, there's no time for birthday presents.

253
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:24,911
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to introduce your song.

254
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:25,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

255
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:25,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

256
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,328
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fighting about a president right now.

257
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:02,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you so girly?

258
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

259
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

260
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm butting notes of Vanessa.

261
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy her a porno book.

262
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:08,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, buy her a porn book, something like that.

263
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:13,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the penthouse, like letters to penthouse compilation book.

264
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:13,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

265
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:14,919
[SPEAKER_07]: You better watch out because I'll order it too.

266
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like three of them.

267
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:17,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

268
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:18,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you want?

269
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:19,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a letters to penthouse?

270
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:21,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just regular books.

271
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:22,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I like reading.

272
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:22,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

273
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's your favorite author?

274
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:25,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Anne Rice.

275
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,990

00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are gross.

279
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,110
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

280
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have those.

281
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do the cage match now, please?

282
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:39,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

283
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:41,392
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what's your pick?

284
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:42,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let me borrow.

285
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:44,614
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your pick for tonight's cage match?

286
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:47,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of porn, Tracy Lord's Say Something.

287
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Appropriate segue there.

288
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:49,916
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

289
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:51,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to say about it?

290
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:53,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Tracy Lord's.

291
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:55,058
[SPEAKER_04]: She was also in Cry Baby.

292
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is, song number one tonight, boys and girls.

[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

296
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

297
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,001
Thanks for watching!

298
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:33,137
Thanks for watching!

299
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I give this soup though an 8 because it has way too many beans in it.

300
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I give that song, I didn't really dig it, I have to admit.

301
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I like some of Trace Lord's other stuff, but not that one.

302
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:38,135
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of was a little soft to me.

303
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:38,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give it a five.

304
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:41,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Very middle of the road for me.

305
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:41,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what'd you pick tonight?

306
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:55,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so out of the middle of nowhere here, I actually, there was a song, of course, I put in Cage Match today from Burnout Revenge, you may remember, by Junkie XL.

307
00:17:55,594 --> 00:18:02,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, that is the single from his new album, which is also called Today, which I bought today.

308
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And ironically enough, I bought an album instead of downloading it off the internet because I couldn't find this one.

309
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:13,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so this is song number two on the album called Mushroom.

310
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:15,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Junkie XL with Mushroom

311
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,249
Thanks for watching!

312
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,827
Thanks for watching!

313
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:33,067
Thank you for watching!

314
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:01,190
Thanks for watching!

315
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:12,782
Thank you.

316
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:23,271
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura gets a 9

317
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:47,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's now go to the third song tonight, which is my pick.

318
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,661
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my pick tonight, I picked a cover of a Journey song.

319
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:53,262
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dance cover of a Journey song.

320
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:56,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And Journey is awesome, and this cover's not bad.

321
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,183
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that bad.

322
00:25:57,444 --> 00:25:58,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Annie just gave me a thumbs up from the hallway.

323
00:25:58,924 --> 00:25:59,765
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows Journey's awesome.

324
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:03,146
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Judy Torres, and the name of the song is Faithfully.

325
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my cage match pick tonight.

326
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:05,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.

327
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:08,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about how awesome Journey is when you hear it.

328
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:41,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Faithfully

329
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

330
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:22,676
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

331
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:45,274
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't set out to savage the stuff that you take out, but I hate songs that I really like being covered like that, especially by people who can't sing.

332
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:46,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets a 2.

333
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:48,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

334
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:51,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like that either, I'm sorry.

335
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:54,136
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just very, eh.

336
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite a 2 though, but I mean, the end was kind of cool.

337
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:57,996
5.

338
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:58,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

339
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:01,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give it a 10, you know why?

340
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:04,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Because finally I recognize the song that you guys played!

341
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:16,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally!

342
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:20,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if it's a bad cover, I recognize it.

343
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate Ted.

344
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I unfortunately can't be that generous to my own song.

345
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it an 8.

346
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:31,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Journey, and I don't care if she covered it and maybe bastardized it a little bit.

347
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:33,736
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me happy, because she made it a happy song.

348
00:31:33,756 --> 00:31:36,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's recap so you guys can vote for your favorite song.

349
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.

350
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Song numero uno, Tracy Lord, Say Something.

351
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Song number two tonight is Junkie XL with Mushroom.

352
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:08,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And song number three in tonight's cage match was Faithfully, Valentin's Dance Edit by Judy Torres.

353
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:20,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why the one through iTunes comes so quiet.

354
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:21,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize to that, guys.

355
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:24,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, and Loki, please refrain from commenting on that.

356
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:25,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there you go.

357
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:26,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are three songs you can vote for tonight.

358
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So please place vote now.

359
00:32:28,689 --> 00:32:31,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

360
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:35,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Song number one, song number two, or song numero three.

361
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And our lovely ops there in chat will tell you how to vote.

362
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:41,077
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't already know, you just send me a private message.

363
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:42,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask one of them if you don't know how.

364
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're about ready to wrap things up here in studio.

365
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:50,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Any exciting plans for this upcoming week that you guys have?

366
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:52,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, food.

367
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, we're going to go get food very soon.

368
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:55,727
[SPEAKER_04]: My doll's arriving.

369
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:56,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm?

370
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:57,349
[SPEAKER_04]: My doll arrives on Tuesday.

371
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:59,690
[SPEAKER_01]: What is up with you getting back into the dolly stuff or whatever it is?

372
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:01,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the customizable thing.

373
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:05,015
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically, for me, it's like, I love to customize things.

374
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I love anything that is art and hobby and, you know, models.

375
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, I think, the perfect thing for me.

376
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:13,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I also am using it to learn how to sew.

377
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:20,870
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of relates to a story I have from last night, is that Annie and I were at Walmart.

378
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,350
[SPEAKER_01]: We were actually with Shane, but he was in the bathroom.

379
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:25,472
[SPEAKER_01]: So Annie and I were kind of walking around the crafting area at Walmart.

380
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:28,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Walmart Supercenter, so it's a huge crafting area.

381
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:30,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were thinking about buying ourselves a project.

382
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:32,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, remember when you were kids...

383
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

384
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:52,735
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

385
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:12,936
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sad and then people would buy it at conventions for lots of money.

386
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:13,596
[SPEAKER_07]: They would.

387
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:14,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

388
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,598
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I need to learn how to do it.

389
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:16,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Or cross stitch.

390
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,100
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really easy.

391
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just make, I'll put Sora on a pillow and people will buy it.

392
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:22,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

393
00:34:22,883 --> 00:34:23,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're whores.

394
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:24,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

395
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:30,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tally up votes, so Loki, tell us a funny story or something.

396
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:31,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up and get your votes in, guys.

397
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:39,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Once was a funny lawyer named Jack Thompson who said funny things like, nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

398
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:41,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that.

399
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the funny thing, though, I had to laugh about.

400
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:47,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

401
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe the vice president shot somebody in the face.

402
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:53,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I never knew the vice president played video games.

403
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:54,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that him in the picture?

404
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:55,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

405
00:34:55,675 --> 00:34:57,497
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like a really old Jon Stewart.

406
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

407
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,981
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he's crazy.

408
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:24,446
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically saying, you know, trying to get these people to go in Louisiana, you know, basically trying to get this sheriff to go back out and check this 16-year-old's house looking for video games because he's saying that video games caused this kid to shoot somebody in the face and beat somebody to death.

409
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:25,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say...

410
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:27,587
[SPEAKER_04]: His own choice made him do it.

411
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:32,270
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the video game did not do that, but... Yeah, of course he's gonna have a video game.

412
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,131
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like saying, well, TV made him do it.

413
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:35,152
[SPEAKER_03]: See if he has a TV.

414
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:37,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was that crazy electricity.

415
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Electricity made him kill.

416
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:41,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Lame.

417
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:46,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, kids, you wanna hear who won tonight's cage match?

418
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:47,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

419
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:48,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

420
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,823
[SPEAKER_01]: All the songs got a little love tonight, but in the end, one song got a lot more love than the other two, and it was...

421
00:35:55,134 --> 00:36:00,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Junkie XL with Mushroom Oh, you chat kids are too predictable sometimes.

422
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,579
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what you voted for, so enjoy it.

423
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that's going to do it, guys.

424
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:09,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for tuning in.

425
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:14,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry we don't have time for chat room reviews, but DarkSakura and I are about to eat our fingers if we don't get food soon.

426
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:16,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.

427
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:16,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

428
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:23,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what a ninja thinks about Dance Dance Revolution, Karaoke Revolution, and the French Revolution.

429
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,392
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

430
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:28,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Reject false icons.

431
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:32,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And my final, final thought is finger.

432
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:34,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fortune cookie message of the day.

433
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't forget that.

434
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:35,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

435
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:36,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it comes.

436
00:36:37,382 --> 00:36:38,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to load it up here.

437
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Boys and girls, here comes your fortune cookie message of the day.

438
00:36:48,092 --> 00:36:49,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy, this is a good one tonight.

439
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:49,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.

440
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Dance, Loki.

441
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, that was fun.

442
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:38,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelly finally taught me how to do the dance because I forgot it.

443
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,203
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's just this.

444
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:40,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, we're radio.

445
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:43,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to get a webcam soon, though, again, so we can do that again.

446
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:52,472
[SPEAKER_08]: The duck quacky beak with your hands, then you do the little chicken thing with your elbows, and then you do the twisty thing with your butt, and then you clap.

447
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:55,174
[SPEAKER_01]: You clap because you just danced with your butt.

448
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:56,835
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you, guys.

449
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yes, that was Loki's old FU music from a long time ago.

450
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:02,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you old school OLR fans remember that.

451
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:03,703
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's it, guys.

452
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:04,944
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking off here.

453
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:07,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so much for listening to us into this very late hour.

454
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:09,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 1230 on the East Coast.

455
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:09,889
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are nuts.

456
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:11,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably morning time.

457
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,551
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun's coming up over in Britain.

458
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:14,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so much for listening and supporting us.

459
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,335
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate you guys' support.

460
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:25,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, podcast award nominations are coming up starting July 1st, and we're going to try and keep that within the independent radio community once again this year.

461
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:28,006
[SPEAKER_01]: We're expecting a lot of competition from some of the corporate shows.
