1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,800
Alright kids, we're getting back here for Orange Lounge Radio, the after birth.

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,060
This is the part of the show that's too hot for podcasting.

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,860
It's scandalous stuff.

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,400
Now this whole room smells like Italian food.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Get that out of here.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,320
Oh, it's better than rotting milk.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Stop putting that...

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Nellie?

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Would you put...

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Nellie, from the...

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Yeah.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
From the three McFlurries.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,040
Fill your rotten milk cup away.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
For me?

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Can I have a breadstick?

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Yay.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Because it smells...

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Three McFlurries and they're all rotting.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Do you want a breadstick?

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Yes, I do.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Thank you for the breadstick.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Thank you for breadsticks.

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Yay! Okay, Nellie's bending over, spank her! Yay!

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,040
What'd you do for your birthday, Nellie?

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,040
I went to the Olive Garden. Wait, get her mic.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Nellie, stop spanking her. Get her on the mic.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,040
What did Nellie do today? I went, okay, Matt took me out

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,040
to breakfast and then we went to my mom's house and I had cake there

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,040
and then I came here and we went to the Olive Garden. Basically, I ate

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,560

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,080

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,140
I am eating a Olive Garden bread stick and enjoying the bread sticky juice goodness

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,300
You looking for the remote control. It's out there somewhere and the damn thing keeps getting lost look in the couch cushion. I've had today

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Wait bring make Annie come in here. I want Annie on the show

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,920
I've had today three small whole wheat pitas with baba ganoush, which is basically eggplant dip mm-hmm

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,000
I've had a small piece of eighty-five percent dark chocolate and four Ritz crackers.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
Alright. So yeah, breadstick.

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,280
What we'll be eating soon. Hi! Hi, Annie! I wanted to invite you on the show. Don't worry, this isn't the podcast.

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,120
Nobody, like, we have like maybe two people listening right now. It's not a big deal.

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,920
So, um, I just wanted to ask you about what games you've been playing this week.

44
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,200
You've been playing a game a lot this weekend. Annie, by the way, is X to first sister,

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,520
everybody. Say hello to our listeners, Annie. Hello.

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,800
yep you're on it's it's it's it's a hot mic they can hear you

47
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,240
all right so what games have you been playing this weekend? Silent Hill

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,880
like Silent Hill 1 the old school? yes and

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,040
why did you decide to start playing Silent Hill? because Shane bought it

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Shane bought it? no brought it or did you? oh he's not here

51
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,080
Miek LaTov is how our listeners know him but that's alright

52
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,080
oh is that how they know you? cause I was supposed to watch

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
well we just started last night and you weren't here

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,080
So wait, what I want to know, and Shane, feel free to jump on the microphone if you want,

55
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:23,080
why is Annie playing this time? Because Shane played through Silent Hill 2 and 4 when you guys were playing that.

56
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
I didn't want to play through it this time.

57
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,080
He said the experience would be so much better if I played, because I always think that it's not scary whenever he plays.

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Now do you play a lot of video games?

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Um, some. I've been playing a lot of Pump It Up lately.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,580
Mm-hmm. Yay!

61
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,380
Alright. No way.

62
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,480
So, have you ever played a lot of scary games before? No.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,480
No? So this is like the first scary game you've played? Yeah, and it terrified me to everything.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,980
Really? Well, really, you're the one coming in every once in a while going,

65
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,980
You're screaming again! No, let me do my impression of Annie playing Silent Hill,

66
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,680
is that every five seconds you're like, Oh my God! Ahh! And then, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof!

67
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,780
Like, you hear, like, sixty gunshots, and then she goes, Is it dead?

68
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,120
because she's not even looking at the screen, she starts screaming. I know, I held out the

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,660
controller and closed my eyes. So for those people that say a video game can't be scary

70
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,180
what would be your response? It can as long as you're the one playing it.

71
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,340
Yeah. What makes it more scary when you're the one playing it?

72
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,260
Because you don't expect anything, but it was always funny when Shane played it

73
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,220
because he was

74
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,660
you know, screaming like a little girl, so that's why it was so funny.

75
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,560
Yeah you were, don't deny it.

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,500
So, have you almost beaten the game?

77
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,340
I beat it.

78
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,400
You did? Yeah. Congratulations.

79
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,560
Yay.

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,680
So, now are you going to play through the others yourself, or? I'm going to play through three.

81
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm going to play through three.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Three is my favorite.

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,480
Is it?

84
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
Yeah. What do you think?

85
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,660
I think it's the worst one.

86
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,320
Three is my favorite because it has that beam.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,480
What? Heather.

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
She has a

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
special beam power.

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,080
A beam? She has the sexy beam. Power?

91
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,440
no she has heather beam the first time around and she gets sexy beam

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
for another she has heather beam and sexy beam and I prefer heather beam

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
because it's heza beam

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,280
heza

95
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,880
I'll show you on my game because I'm cheating

96
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,120
you're cheating? I'm cheating hardcore

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,160
I've got all items, all maps

98
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,880
would you cheat through silent name?

99
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,720
we did

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,400
no because we were so lost at the end of it we didn't know what to do

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
okay you went on game facts

102
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
I don't know.

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,500
My idea of cheating is putting in like a game shark.

104
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Using codes.

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,320
Like an up, up, down, down, left, right type thing.

106
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,840
Because I'm only playing it for the story.

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,080
Yeah, we only did it for like figuring out things.

108
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Okay.

109
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,520
Oh, are you going to play any other scary games like Resident Evil, Siren, anything

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
else?

111
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm not really too familiar.

112
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Okay.

113
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
What would you say is your favorite video game?

114
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Probably Silent Hill now.

115
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
I like it a lot.

116
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
I really like it.

117
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
It's so much fun.

118
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay.

119
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
That's cool.

120
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,520
I want to say Kingdom Hearts, but it hasn't really been my favorite for a while now.

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
It's getting, you know, kind of boring.

122
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
That's fair.

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,520
I opened up the chat room if anybody wanted to ask Annie a question.

124
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
So we have some questions from the chat.

125
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Let's see.

126
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Jeremy Todd wants to know, does she like bacon?

127
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Yummy.

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Let's see here.

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,460
VXJsonXV wants to know if you've ever played a game called Fatal Frame.

130
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,260
Of course.

131
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,300
You're lying. I wish we were a TV show because she's saying of course.

132
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,200
You don't have to lie to the listeners just to be cool.

133
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,020
I'm not trying to be cool. They're cool.

134
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,760
Some of these questions are inappropriate.

135
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,540
Now DMM wants to know if you're single.

136
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Yes. Forever.

137
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,540
I wanted to know if you like dark meat.

138
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,540
If I like dark meat? Like on a turkey or something?

139
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,540
No, I think you need black.

140
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
Oh, okay.

141
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,540
No comments.

142
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,540
No, that's alright. Don't acknowledge that. That's trash. Don't acknowledge that trash.

143
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,540
And she might be single boys, but she's always going to be together with Jesus Christ, and not with any of you.

144
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,540
So, you know what? Buzz off.

145
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm married to Jesus.

146
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,180
Okay, God, you guys ask some lame questions here.

147
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,620
Yeah, ask some good ones. Legend of Zaku wants to know, paper or plastic?

148
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,660
Paper all the way.

149
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,700
Alright, lastly, Jeremy Todd1 wants to know what size are your shoes?

150
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,900
I think seven and a half.

151
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,380
Why is that important? I don't know, so I'm

152
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,180

Okay, that's fine.

162
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
She's a good sport, ladies and gentlemen, we appreciate it.

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,420
By the way, just to make the chat room shut up...

164
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,720
BACON!

165
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,240
It's nasty!

166
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
It's disgusting!

167
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,360
It's the fat off of a dead pig! Why haven't they been trying to get you to say bacon

168
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,520
forever?

169
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,640
I guess I think the other week they were trying to get me to say bacon, so...

170
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,880
Whatever. Because both of you guys said it, and they want me to conform. What, is somebody pointing together like a bacon thing or

171
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
something?

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,680
I don't like bringing up the, you know, the sliced off fat of a dead pig that people eat.

173
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
It's nasty.

174
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
But it's still delicious.

175
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Nasty.

176
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm sporting my Olive Bacon shirt.

177
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,680
You know what's delicious is veal.

178
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Mmm baby cow.

179
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Get extra.

180
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Yummy.

181
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
It's all about your sister tonight.

182
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
We're done with you.

183
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
A meat so tender.

184
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
When I was a meat eater though I was fond of lamb.

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Alright.

186
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,680
such a thing as like baby pig, like can you get like baby pig and bacon?

187
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I want to get to the cage match boys and girls cause I'm in the right place tonight and are

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
we are going to retire?

189
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Because it's been in rotation for four weeks.

190
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Has it?

191
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I thought it was three.

192
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
That's alright, I don't care.

193
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
It's been a while anyways.

194
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
People forgot.

195
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Just so you guys know, here it is, it's officially being retired from the cage match.

196
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Hot Topic is not punk rock, here's a clip.

197
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:58,660
It's been officially played in Hot Topic now.

198
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,240
It didn't win four times, but because of E3 and Faname, it just kind of stuck around

199
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
for four weeks.

200
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,320

Alright. Who's your favorite author?

209
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760

I have...

211
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
I don't know.

212
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
This is Anne Rice writes gay porno.

213
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Dude, Anne Rice wrote The Erotic Adventures of Sleeping Beauty.

214
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah, those are gross.

215
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Alright. Can we do the cage match now, please?

216
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Yeah, okay.

217
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Dark Sakura, what's your pick?

218
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
And then let me borrow from you.

219
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
What's your pick for tonight's cage match?

220
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Speaking of porn, Tracy Lords say something.

221
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,760
appropriate segway there. Alright.

222
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,160
Anything else you want to say about it?

223
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,000
It's Tracy Lords. She was also in Cry Baby. Here it is, song number one tonight,

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
boys and girls, Tracy Lords with Say Something. Enjoy!

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's summer of innocence for me

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:09,440
I can see it all for me Here it comes now, it means nothing

227
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,940
Just say something, just say something

228
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,140
I think you know I am only here among us

229
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,520
Say something

230
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,440
I think you know i am only here among us

231
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,140
Say something

232
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,180
I think you know I am only here among us

233
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:37,180
It's the summer of shame for me I can see the fall before me

234
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Please, how did you know I am only here among us?

235
00:15:48,180 --> 00:16:02,180
Say something

236
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,420
Don't think you know why you're Wet

237
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,940
Don't think you know why you're Wet

238
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,680
Don't think you know why you're Wet

239
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,300
Don't think you know why you're Wet

240
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,420
Don't think you know why you're Wet

241
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,980
Don't think you know why you're Wet

242
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
🎵Music🎵

243
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:14,980
The song number one by Dark Sakura was Say Something, and we're gonna say something about

244
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,700
that song right now, good or bad, Dark Sakura.

245
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,840
It's seven, it's very mellow.

246
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,060
I mean, I like, it's better than some of the other stuff.

247
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Loki

248
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,060
I guess a 7, because it was okay. It was just very chilled out.

249
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,060
I give this soup, though, an 8, because it has way too many beans in it.

250
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,060
I give that song... I didn't really dig it, I have to admit.

251
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
I like some of Trace's other stuff, but not that one.

252
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,060
That kind of was a little soft to me, so I give it a 5.

253
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
Very middle of the road for me.

254
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,060
Loki, what did you pick tonight?

255
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Okay, so out of the middle of nowhere here, I actually...

256
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:55,060
There was a song, of course, I put in Cage Match today from Burnout Revenge, you may remember, by Junkie XL.

257
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:02,060
And actually that is the single from his new album, which is also called Today, which I bought today.

258
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:08,060
And ironically enough, I bought an album instead of downloading it off the internet, because I couldn't find this one.

259
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Anyways, so this is song number two on the album, called Mushroom.

260
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:21,060
It's interesting because he actually did, um, he produced Sasha's last album, which was Air Dogger, I think.

261
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,060
And it, the whole album feels very similar to that one, and this is kind of, I don't know, it's very unique, I like it.

262
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
So, check it out.

263
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Alright, here it is kids, song number two tonight, Junky Uxell with Mushroom.

264
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:39,060
Not Hollick, I want Mushroom.

265
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
Oh

266
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
Oh

267
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
Oh

268
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:25,860
Alright kids, that was song number two tonight, Junkie Uxl with Mushroom.

269
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Let's see what we thought of that one, Dark Sockrab.

270
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,860
It put me to sleep. It was really repetitive and kind of not exciting, so I get to fly.

271
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Loki!

272
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,860
It gets a 9 because it's cool and doesn't have badgering.

273
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,860
Uh, it needs to be about half as long as it was. I give it a 6.

274
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,860
Alright, let's now go to the third song tonight, which is my pick.

275
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,860
And for my pick tonight, I picked a cover of a Journey song. It's a dance cover of a Journey song.

276
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,860
And Journey is awesome, and this cover's not bad. It's not that bad.

277
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
that bad.

278
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,220
And he just gave me a thumbs up from the hallway, she knows Journey's awesome.

279
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,900
So this is Judy Torres, and the name of the song is Faithfully, and it's my cage match

280
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
pick tonight.

281
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Enjoy.

282
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,900
awesome journey is when you hear it.

283
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,900
I may run into the midnight sun

284
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,900
The wheels go round and round, you're on my mind

285
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight

286
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:04,900
I'm sending all my love along the wire

287
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,900
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family

288
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,900
But right down the lane it's been you and me

289
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,900
And loving somebody like me ain't always what it's supposed to be

290
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,900
But you, you stand behind me

291
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:41,900
I'm forever yours, faithfully

292
00:27:41,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Oh circus life, under the big dark world We all need the clouds, can you make us smile?

293
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,900
Through space and time

294
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Always another show

295
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Wondering where I am

296
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Lost without you

297
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,900
And being apart ain't easy

298
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,900
All this love affair

299
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:34,900
Two strangers learn to fall in love again

300
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:42,900
And I get the joy of rediscovering you

301
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:49,900
And do you stand by me

302
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:55,900
I forever know

303
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,900
Faithfully

304
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Faithfully

305
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:39,900
I'm your yours, I'm forever yours, Yours

306
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:16,900
You know, I don't set out to savage the stuff that you take out, but I have to say that

307
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:45,900
I hate songs that I really like being covered like that, especially by people who can't sing.

308
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:51,980
So it gets a two all right Loki. I don't like that either. I'm sorry. It's just very

309
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,900
Not quite a two though, but I mean the end is kind of cool

310
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,840
Five all right. Yeah, I like the end that ends my favorite part. Yes

311
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,800
That's the kind of song I hear at the close of a gay club

312
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,400
What Oh Nelly wants to review it yes Nelly

313
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I'm gonna give it a 10, you know why?

314
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,900
Why?

315
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,000
Because finally I recognize the song that you guys played!

316
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Finally!

317
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,200
I don't care if it's a bad cover, I recognize it!

318
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
Yay, 10!

319
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,400
Okay, I unfortunately can't be that generous to my own song.

320
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll give it an 8, because I love Churney, and I don't care if she covered it and maybe bastardized it a little bit.

321
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It makes me happy, because she made it a happy song.

322
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,800

00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
Hm?

339
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,820
My doll arrives on Tuesday.

340
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,060
What is up with you getting back into the dolly stuff or whatever it is?

341
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,580
It's the customizable thing. It's basically, for me, it's like

342
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,700
I love to customize things. I love anything that is

343
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,800
art and hobby and, you know, models and this is, I think, the perfect

344
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,520
thing for me. I also am using it to learn how to sew.

345
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,520
That kind of relates to a story I have from last night is that Annie and I were at Walmart. We were actually with Shane, but he was in the bathroom.

346
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,140
So, Annie and I were kind of walking around the crafting area at Walmart. And this is the Walmart

347
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,380
Supercenters. It's a huge crafting area.

348
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,100
and we were thinking about buying ourselves a project. Like remember when

349
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,940
you were kids

350
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,900
they had like those stained glass things that you put the little crystals in

351
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,820
and you can put it in the oven and they make like a stained glass little

352
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,740
cartoon character or whatever. Or the coasters, you put the little beads in the thing and then

353
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,340
iron it

354
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,820
and it's a coaster. We were thinking about buying one of those. We didn't. And then we thought about

355
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,260
taking up crocheting.

356
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,300
Like we were going to make scarves for no good reason. I know how to knit.

357
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,060
I can teach you how to make a scarf. You should teach me how to make a scarf. That would be fun.

358
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,260
You'll make somebody a great wife one day. I can make orange lounge scarves, wouldn't that be great?

359
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,500
I can teach you how to do that. All I would have to do, or like get one of those patterns

360
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:05,980
with like

361
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,700
the Care Bear patterns, but make the Care Bear like black

362
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,060
and sad and then people would buy it at conventions for lots of money.

363
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,820
They would. I know. That's why you need to learn how to do it. Or cross stitch.

364
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,060
Mm-hmm. That's really easy. I'll just make, I'll put Sora

365
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,580
on a pillow and people will buy it. Yeah, I don't know. Cause they're whores.

366
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,580
Okay.

367
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:30,180
All right, I have to tally up votes, so, Loki, tell us a funny story or something.

368
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,980
Hurry up and get your votes in, guys.

369
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,500
Once was a funny lawyer named Jack Thompson who said funny things like, nobody shoots

370
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,100
anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

371
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,020
I saw that.

372
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,580
Here's the funny thing, though, I had to laugh about.

373
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,020
Nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

374
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,840
I do believe the vice president shot somebody in the face.

375
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,440
I never knew the vice president played video games.

376
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,880
Is that him in the picture?

377
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,520
Yes, it is.

378
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,920
He looks like a really old Jon Stewart.

379
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Does he?

380
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,000
Kind of.

381
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But yeah, he's crazy.

382
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,360
He's basically trying to get these people to go.

383
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,120
Louisiana, basically trying to get the sheriff

384
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,220
to go back out and check this 16-year-old's house looking

385
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,760
for video games because he's saying

386
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,040
video games cause this kid to shoot somebody in the face and beat somebody to death and I say

387
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,600
no choice made him do it no no the video game did not do that but yeah of course he's gonna

388
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,200
have a video game that's just like saying old tv made him do it see if he has a tv

389
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,040
i think it was that crazy electricity electricity made him kill

390
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,780
lame

391
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,600
all right kids you want to hear who won tonight's cage match sure all right uh all the songs got

392
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,000
got a little love tonight, but in the end, one song got a lot more love than the other

393
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,960
two, and it was Junkie XL with Mushroom.

394
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,280
Oh, you chat kids are too predictable sometimes.

395
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,960
That's what you voted for, so enjoy it.

396
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,400
All right, that's going to do it, guys.

397
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Thanks so much for tuning in.

398
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,800
Sorry we don't have time for chat room reviews, but Dark Soccer and I are about to eat our

399
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,520
fingers if we don't get food soon.

400
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,880
So let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.

401
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Loki.

402
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,880
I want to know what a ninja thinks about dance dance revolution, karaoke revolution, and the French Revolution.

403
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,880
Darkstalker, your final thought?

404
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Reject false icons.

405
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,880
And my final, final thought is finger.

406
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Oh, fortune cookie message of the day. Can't forget that.

407
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,880
Here it comes. I just have to load it up here.

408
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Boys and girls, here comes your fortune cookie message of the day.

409
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,880
Oh boy, this is a good one tonight, enjoy!

410
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,880
dance Loki

411
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Oh

412
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Oh

413
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Hey!

414
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Hey!

415
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Hey!

416
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Hey!

417
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Hey!

418
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,200
Yay, that was fun.

419
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,160
Nellie finally taught me how to do the dance because I forgot it, but you know, it's just

420
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,440
this, oh wait, we're radio.

421
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,840
I'm hoping to get a webcam soon though again so we can do that again.

422
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,080
The duck quacky beak with your hands, then you do the little chicken thing with your

423
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,840
elbows, and then you do the twisty thing with your butt, and then you clap.

424
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,600
You clap because you just danced with your butt.

425
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,600
All right, thank you guys, and yes, that was Loki's old F.U. music from a long time ago.

426
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Those of you old school O.L.R. fans remember that.

427
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
All right, that's it, guys. We're taking off here.

428
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Thank you guys so much for listening to us into this very late hour.

429
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,600
It's like 1230 on the East Coast. You guys are nuts.

430
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Probably morning time. The sun's coming up over in Britain.

431
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Thank you guys so much for listening and supporting us.

432
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
We really appreciate you guys' support.

433

Just so you know, podcast award nominations are coming up starting July 1st,

436
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,040
of competition from some of the corporate shows.
