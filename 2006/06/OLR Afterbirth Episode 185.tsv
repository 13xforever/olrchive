23530	27651	Alright kids, we're getting back here for Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.
27691	30292	This is the part of the show that's too hot for podcasting.
31372	32453	It's scandalous stuff.
32793	34273	Now this whole room smells like Italian food.
34313	34834	Get that out of here.
35394	36854	It's better than rotting milk.
37054	38855	Stop putting that... Nelly?
39035	43436	What was it from the... Yeah, from the three McFlurries.
44477	46137	Fill your rotten milk cup away.
46977	47297	For me?
47738	48378	Can I have a breadstick?
48398	48678	Yay!
50943	53505	Three McFlurries and they're all rotting.
53605	54205	Do you want a breadstick?
54685	55166	Yes, I do.
56287	57207	Thank you for the breadstick.
61250	62751	Food from Olive Garden.
64493	64953	Thank you, Nellie.
64973	65714	That was very kind of you.
65734	66334	I appreciate that.
66374	66714	You're welcome.
66734	67355	I have another bag.
67657	69277	We're going to go to Lion's.
69317	69738	Happy birthday!
69758	73899	How did you get like three bags of bread from Olive Garden?
74119	81141	I only have two bags because one of the bags was the leftovers from what was on the table and then I got Matt's dinner to go and that came with four breadsticks.
81681	82021	Okay.
82181	83741	It's her birthday today, by the way.
83761	84702	Happy birthday, Nellie!
84742	85922	Are we going to spank her live on air?
86782	87142	Yay!
87202	87963	Okay, Nellie's bending over.
88003	88343	Spank her!
88483	88783	Yay!
92744	93884	What did you do for your birthday, Nellie?
95725	96305	Wait, get her mic.
96565	96905	Get her mic.
99116	100217	Loki, stop spanking her.
100277	102337	Get her out of my way.
102577	103318	What did Nellie do today?
105338	109400	Matt took me out to breakfast, and then we went to my mom's house, and I had cake there.
109980	113341	And then I came here, and we went to the Olive Garden.
113361	114522	Basically, I ate all day.
115482	117983	And yesterday... I know, it's delicious.
118043	119063	I ate all weekend, actually.
119103	122144	We went to Joe's Crab Shack yesterday.
123185	125846	I got barbecue crab, and I highly recommend it.
127066	129227	Nothing, because my friends don't like me.
129888	130408	I like you.
130708	131689	I know, you didn't do anything.
132189	133950	No, I'm kidding.
134370	135130	I'm hurt.
135891	137352	I won't do anything for your birthday either.
137372	139092	I'm going to have a party.
139112	140513	I'll take you on a shopping spree at Walmart.
141554	143155	Okay, that's my favorite store.
143975	145476	Ew, Target's way better.
146707	147587	Sorry guys, I'm eating.
147607	151068	I know we're supposed to be doing a radio program here, but now the podcast is over, I don't care.
151528	152849	The podcast is the important show.
152909	154269	Hey, one of our listeners has a question.
154449	154909	Alright, what?
155849	158970	It's about if you can play the wave bird on the Wii.
160551	161831	I don't know, find out when it comes out.
163372	165132	Because the port things aren't the right size.
165352	166192	I don't think they are, no.
166492	167253	You may be able to.
167953	168333	Maybe.
168733	169053	We'll see.
171154	172234	This Jeremy Todd one.
172987	178170	Sorry, I'm eating an Olive Garden breadstick and enjoying the breadsticky goodness.
178190	180392	Are you looking for the remote control?
181032	183253	It's out there somewhere and the damn thing keeps getting lost.
183313	184474	Look in the couch cushions.
184634	188016	I've had today three... Wait, make Annie come in here.
188317	189217	I want Annie on the show.
190038	196542	I've had today three small whole wheat pitas with baba ganoush, which is basically eggplant dip.
197622	201865	I've had a small piece of 85% dark chocolate and four Ritz crackers.
203513	206175	Silent Hill 1, The Old School Yes
233018	235900	and why did you decide to start playing Silent Hill?
235920	236961	Because Shane bought it.
237701	238302	Shane bought it?
238562	239142	No, brought it.
239262	240783	Or did you... Oh, he's not here.
241204	243065	Miklatov is how our listeners know him, but that's alright.
244166	245226	Oh, is that how they know you?
245246	246647	Because I was supposed to watch.
252179	253200	I didn't want to play through this time.
253220	256482	He said the experience would be so much better if I played because I always think that it's not scary whenever he plays.
256502	256702	Um, some.
256722	258164	I've been playing a lot of Pump It Up lately.
258264	258524	So, yay!
278695	278915	All right.
278955	281197	No way.
281497	283899	So have you ever played a lot of scary games before?
284099	284199	No.
284600	284740	No?
284820	286161	So this is like the first scary game you were playing?
286181	288002	Yeah, and it terrified me to everything.
288363	292986	Well, really, you were the one coming in every once in a while going, you're screaming again.
293146	297770	No, let me do my impression of Annie playing Silent Hill, is that every five seconds you're like, oh my god!
298450	321800	and then like you hear like 60 gunshots and then she's on my bullet is it dead because she's not even looking at the screen she starts screaming i know i held out the controller and closed my eyes so for those people that say a video game can't be scary what would you what would be your response it can as long as you're the one playing it yeah what makes it more scary when you're the one playing it
322403	323324	I'm going to play through three.
346037	346738	3 is my favorite.
347518	347878	Is it?
348499	348599	Yeah.
348619	349279	What do you think?
349779	351841	I think it's the worst one.
351861	353502	3 is my favorite because of Heza Beam.
354402	354682	What?
355683	355963	Heather.
356584	358825	She has a special beam power.
359205	360866	She has the sexy beam.
361166	364328	No, she has Heather Beam the first time around and then she gets sexy beam.
366369	367790	She has Heather Beam and sexy beam.
368131	369071	And I prefer Heather Beam.
369551	370592	Because it's Heza Beam.
371473	371773	Heza...
372653	374114	I'll show you on my game because I'm cheating.
374855	375375	You're cheating?
375595	376556	I'm cheating hardcore.
377217	378337	Okay.
378418	379879	I've got all items, all maps.
380179	381520	Would you cheat through Silent Hill?
382000	382781	We did.
382821	383261	Oh, you did?
383761	385803	No, because we were so lost at the end of it.
385883	386583	We didn't know what to do.
386624	387704	Okay, you went on GameFAQs.
388185	388605	I don't know.
389346	391587	My idea of cheating is putting in a game shark.
392368	395250	Using codes, like up, up, down, down, left, right type thing.
395270	396871	Because I'm only playing it for the story.
396911	399433	Yeah, we only did it for figuring out things.
401994	405776	Are you going to play any other scary games like Resident Evil, Siren, anything else?
405876	407337	I'm not really too familiar.
407857	409138	What would you say is your favorite video game?
411219	412100	Probably Silent Hill now.
412700	413240	I like it a lot.
413300	414141	I really like it.
414281	415481	It's so much fun.
416042	417702	What was your favorite video game before yesterday?
420242	424203	I want to say Kingdom Hearts, but it hasn't really been my favorite for a while now.
425124	427244	Well, it's getting, you know, kind of boring.
427944	428345	That's fair.
428785	432146	I opened up the chat room if anybody wanted to ask Annie a question.
432446	433986	So we have some questions from the chat.
434766	435167	Let's see.
435387	438087	Jeremy Todd wants to know, does she like bacon?
439008	439428	Mm-hmm.
440768	441228	Yummy.
442169	442809	Let's see here.
444629	447850	VXJasonXV wants to know if you've ever played a game called Fatal Frame.
448551	449051	Of course.
453027	456809	I wish we were a TV show because she's saying, of course, she's shaking her head.
456829	458710	You don't have to lie to the listeners just to be cool.
459271	460351	I'm not trying to be cool.
460752	461772	All right.
462232	462733	All right.
462773	465014	Some of these questions are inappropriate.
465054	466335	Yeah, we're getting inappropriate.
466415	468156	Now DMM wants to know if you're single.
468856	469136	Yes.
470037	470877	Forever.
471057	471798	Forever.
471898	474800	I don't want them to know if you like dark meat.
475600	478262	If I like dark meats, like on a turkey or something?
478282	478862	No, I don't.
479082	479342	No.
480623	481384	Oh, okay.
483326	483886	No comments.
485507	486068	No, that's right.
486128	486969	Don't acknowledge that.
487029	487989	That's trash.
488310	489270	Don't acknowledge that trash.
490311	495135	And she might be single, boys, but she's always going to be together with Jesus Christ and not with any of you.
495235	497217	So, you know what?
497237	499118	Buzz off.
499759	500780	I'm married to Jesus.
503162	505103	God, you guys ask some lame questions here.
505243	506204	Yeah, I ask some good ones.
506604	508466	Legend of Zaku wants to know, paper or plastic?
509344	511306	Um, paper all the way.
514008	517531	Alright, lastly, Jeremy Todd 1 wants to know, what size are your shoes?
518392	520133	Um, I think seven and a half.
521577	522798	Why is that important?
523138	523538	I don't know.
523558	528082	I'm going to say no more questions for Annie.
529402	530243	Wait, here's a good one.
530263	531324	I'll let this go.
531444	532285	Here's a good question.
532705	535487	Ranma wants to know, PSP or DS?
535547	536007	DS.
536508	536708	Why?
537008	538509	Because it's so great.
539830	540871	No, I love Tetris.
541031	541971	I love it so much.
542892	544233	Ever played Luminous on the PSP?
544433	544673	No.
545834	546174	I have.
546495	546775	I have.
547115	547375	I have.
547736	547916	Okay.
548556	549017	Alright, fair enough.
549538	550679	Well, thanks for coming on the show, Annie.
550699	551600	Last minute, I appreciate it.
551741	552281	No problem.
552301	555366	Stick around if you want, but otherwise, we're gonna... I'm gonna go, bye.
555506	556026	Okay, that's fine.
557268	558530	She's a good sport, ladies and gentlemen.
558550	561354	By the way, by the way, just to make the chat room shut up.
562475	563116	Bacon!
564558	566999	Thank you for watching.
567059	568621	See you next time.
584475	591759	I don't like bringing up the sliced off fat of a dead pig that people eat.
592039	595621	It's nasty.
595661	597482	I'm sporting my I Love Bacon shirt.
598162	600183	You know what's delicious is veal.
601324	602204	Mmm, baby cow.
602605	602965	Yummy.
605886	607268	It's all about your sister tonight.
607288	607848	We're done with you.
607868	608829	The meat's so tender.
609370	611572	When I was a meat-eater, though, I was fond of lamb.
612273	613994	Do they have such a thing as, like, baby pig?
614175	616157	Like, can you get, like, baby pig and bacon?
616517	620641	Look, I want to get to the cage match, boys and girls, because I'm retiring tonight.
620741	623023	Are we are going to retire your song?
623043	624385	Because it's been in rotation for four weeks.
624625	624985	Has it?
625205	625806	I thought it was three.
625846	626206	That's all right.
626226	627086	I don't care.
627426	628387	It's been a while anyways.
628427	628907	People forgot.
628947	631268	But just so you guys know, here it is.
631348	633469	It's officially being retired from the cage match.
633890	635250	Hot Topic is not punk rock.
635290	635771	Here's a clip.
636131	637571	Hot Topic is not punk rock.
637611	638612	Hot Topic is not punk rock.
654130	656051	All right, so that song gets retired.
656071	658373	This has been officially played in Hot Topic now.
658613	664557	It didn't win four times, but because of E3 and Faname, it just kind of stuck around for four weeks.
664577	665077	It's sort of sick of it.
665097	665618	It snuck by.
666078	670541	All right, so DarkSakura's going to put a new song in tonight's cage match, so here we go with tonight's cage match.
670561	671302	And it's horrible.
671642	672222	All right, hold on.
672282	672783	We're not there yet.
672803	678366	Because I have to remind the folks who are listening, you have to be in the chat room to participate in...
680968	684031	DarkSakura has song... Wait, no, there's no time for birthday presents.
684051	684911	You have to introduce your song.
684931	685031	Okay.
685051	685151	Okay.
712562	714328	They're fighting about a president right now.
721889	722429	Why are you so girly?
722870	723150	Alright.
723350	723831	Okay.
723951	725572	I'm butting notes of Vanessa.
725592	726553	Buy her a porno book.
726573	728774	Yeah, buy her a porn book, something like that.
728794	733018	I like the penthouse, like letters to penthouse compilation book.
733078	733398	Okay.
733418	734919	You better watch out because I'll order it too.
735079	736140	I have like three of them.
737341	737681	I do.
738062	738742	Is that what you want?
738782	739763	Like a letters to penthouse?
740344	741384	Or just regular books.
741444	742605	I like reading.
742705	742966	Alright.
743286	744247	Who's your favorite author?
745267	745628	Anne Rice.
746668	748990	I have a... I... I don't know.
749010	750592	This is Anne Rice writes gay porno.
751728	754089	and Rice for the Erotic Adventures of Sleeping Beauty.
754129	755450	Yeah, those are gross.
755790	756110	All right.
756670	757370	I don't have those.
757451	758551	Can we do the cage match now, please?
758771	759631	Yeah, okay.
760112	761392	DarkSakura, what's your pick?
761432	762933	And then let me borrow.
763193	764614	What's your pick for tonight's cage match?
764634	767535	Speaking of porn, Tracy Lord's Say Something.
767795	769596	Appropriate segue there.
769616	769916	All right.
770816	771717	Anything else you want to say about it?
772197	773337	It's Tracy Lord's.
773997	775058	She was also in Cry Baby.
775178	777539	Here it is, song number one tonight, boys and girls.
777619	779200	Tracy Lord's with Say Something.
779320	779620	Enjoy.
787608	789310	Thanks for watching!
848345	849532	Thank you for watching!
890069	892001	Thanks for watching!
988171	993137	Thanks for watching!
1030370	1034074	I give this soup though an 8 because it has way too many beans in it.
1052031	1054393	I give that song, I didn't really dig it, I have to admit.
1054413	1056194	I like some of Trace Lord's other stuff, but not that one.
1056214	1058135	That kind of was a little soft to me.
1058155	1058876	So I give it a five.
1059376	1061057	Very middle of the road for me.
1061097	1061978	Loki, what'd you pick tonight?
1064269	1075154	Okay, so out of the middle of nowhere here, I actually, there was a song, of course, I put in Cage Match today from Burnout Revenge, you may remember, by Junkie XL.
1075594	1082498	And actually, that is the single from his new album, which is also called Today, which I bought today.
1083038	1088140	And ironically enough, I bought an album instead of downloading it off the internet because I couldn't find this one.
1088621	1093363	Anyways, so this is song number two on the album called Mushroom.
1094043	1095324	Junkie XL with Mushroom
1125558	1127249	Thanks for watching!
1322781	1323827	Thanks for watching!
1352345	1353067	Thank you for watching!
1440368	1441190	Thanks for watching!
1512259	1512782	Thank you.
1522591	1523271	DarkSakura gets a 9
1544298	1547780	Alright, let's now go to the third song tonight, which is my pick.
1548440	1551661	And for my pick tonight, I picked a cover of a Journey song.
1551701	1553262	It's a dance cover of a Journey song.
1553602	1556223	And Journey is awesome, and this cover's not bad.
1556623	1557183	It's not that bad.
1557444	1558884	Annie just gave me a thumbs up from the hallway.
1558924	1559765	She knows Journey's awesome.
1560145	1563146	So this is Judy Torres, and the name of the song is Faithfully.
1563646	1565427	And it's my cage match pick tonight.
1565507	1565847	Enjoy.
1566247	1568028	And think about how awesome Journey is when you hear it.
1660366	1661212	Faithfully
1738486	1739138	Thanks for watching!
1822355	1822676	DarkSakura
1834031	1845274	You know, I don't set out to savage the stuff that you take out, but I hate songs that I really like being covered like that, especially by people who can't sing.
1846294	1846914	So it gets a 2.
1847094	1848494	Alright, Loki.
1849595	1851095	I didn't like that either, I'm sorry.
1851415	1854136	It was just very, eh.
1855376	1857996	Not quite a 2 though, but I mean, the end was kind of cool.
1858016	1857996	5.
1858416	1858797	Alright.
1860897	1861978	I'm gonna give it a 10, you know why?
1861998	1864319	Because finally I recognize the song that you guys played!
1876205	1876966	Finally!
1877766	1880168	I don't care if it's a bad cover, I recognize it.
1881088	1883249	I hate Ted.
1883369	1885531	I unfortunately can't be that generous to my own song.
1885551	1886251	I'll give it an 8.
1886731	1891154	I love Journey, and I don't care if she covered it and maybe bastardized it a little bit.
1891174	1893736	It makes me happy, because she made it a happy song.
1893756	1896897	Anyway, let's recap so you guys can vote for your favorite song.
1896917	1898518	Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.
1898598	1900980	Song numero uno, Tracy Lord, Say Something.
1909699	1912921	Song number two tonight is Junkie XL with Mushroom.
1922387	1928611	And song number three in tonight's cage match was Faithfully, Valentin's Dance Edit by Judy Torres.
1937642	1940964	I don't know why the one through iTunes comes so quiet.
1940984	1941945	I apologize to that, guys.
1942005	1944106	Anyway, and Loki, please refrain from commenting on that.
1944466	1945067	Anyway, there you go.
1945127	1946788	Those are three songs you can vote for tonight.
1946828	1948629	So please place vote now.
1948689	1951191	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1951611	1955654	Song number one, song number two, or song numero three.
1956254	1959056	And our lovely ops there in chat will tell you how to vote.
1959116	1961077	If you don't already know, you just send me a private message.
1961177	1962318	Ask one of them if you don't know how.
1963279	1965860	Anyway, we're about ready to wrap things up here in studio.
1968101	1970383	Any exciting plans for this upcoming week that you guys have?
1971584	1972925	Um, food.
1973766	1975067	I know, we're going to go get food very soon.
1975087	1975727	My doll's arriving.
1976148	1976368	Hmm?
1976428	1977349	My doll arrives on Tuesday.
1977369	1979690	What is up with you getting back into the dolly stuff or whatever it is?
1980231	1981432	It's the customizable thing.
1981552	1985015	It's basically, for me, it's like, I love to customize things.
1985075	1990099	I love anything that is art and hobby and, you know, models.
1990199	1992321	And this is, I think, the perfect thing for me.
1992341	1993782	I also am using it to learn how to sew.
1997588	2000870	That kind of relates to a story I have from last night, is that Annie and I were at Walmart.
2000910	2002350	We were actually with Shane, but he was in the bathroom.
2002651	2005472	So Annie and I were kind of walking around the crafting area at Walmart.
2005492	2008013	And this is the Walmart Supercenter, so it's a huge crafting area.
2008494	2010915	And we were thinking about buying ourselves a project.
2011295	2012816	Like, remember when you were kids...
2013596	2014077	Thanks for watching!
2032295	2032735	DarkSakura.com
2049873	2052936	and Sad and then people would buy it at conventions for lots of money.
2053176	2053596	They would.
2053776	2054016	I know.
2054677	2055598	That's why I need to learn how to do it.
2055618	2056558	Or cross stitch.
2057439	2058100	That's really easy.
2058140	2061743	I'll just make, I'll put Sora on a pillow and people will buy it.
2062363	2062863	Yeah, I don't know.
2062883	2063464	Because they're whores.
2064004	2064345	Okay.
2066586	2070068	I have to tally up votes, so Loki, tell us a funny story or something.
2070308	2071329	Hurry up and get your votes in, guys.
2071869	2079594	Once was a funny lawyer named Jack Thompson who said funny things like, nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.
2080494	2081115	I saw that.
2081875	2083776	Here's the funny thing, though, I had to laugh about.
2084336	2087378	Nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.
2088099	2090240	I do believe the vice president shot somebody in the face.
2091892	2093393	I never knew the vice president played video games.
2093553	2094654	Is that him in the picture?
2094955	2095355	Yes, it is.
2095675	2097497	He looks like a really old Jon Stewart.
2099980	2100400	Kind of.
2101040	2102981	But yeah, he's crazy.
2103081	2124446	He's basically saying, you know, trying to get these people to go in Louisiana, you know, basically trying to get this sheriff to go back out and check this 16-year-old's house looking for video games because he's saying that video games caused this kid to shoot somebody in the face and beat somebody to death.
2124546	2125246	And I say...
2125746	2127587	His own choice made him do it.
2128127	2132270	No, the video game did not do that, but... Yeah, of course he's gonna have a video game.
2132330	2134131	That's just like saying, well, TV made him do it.
2134151	2135152	See if he has a TV.
2135352	2137313	I think it was that crazy electricity.
2137633	2139174	Electricity made him kill.
2141395	2141655	Lame.
2144797	2146739	Alright, kids, you wanna hear who won tonight's cage match?
2147339	2147559	Sure.
2147819	2148119	Alright.
2148980	2153823	All the songs got a little love tonight, but in the end, one song got a lot more love than the other two, and it was...
2155134	2160818	Junkie XL with Mushroom Oh, you chat kids are too predictable sometimes.
2161958	2163579	But that's what you voted for, so enjoy it.
2164860	2167602	Alright, that's going to do it, guys.
2168242	2169183	Thanks so much for tuning in.
2169203	2174106	Sorry we don't have time for chat room reviews, but DarkSakura and I are about to eat our fingers if we don't get food soon.
2174426	2176247	So let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.
2176287	2176568	Loki.
2177608	2183352	I want to know what a ninja thinks about Dance Dance Revolution, Karaoke Revolution, and the French Revolution.
2186351	2187392	DarkSakura, your final thought.
2188173	2188994	Reject false icons.
2189494	2192137	And my final, final thought is finger.
2193118	2194659	Oh, fortune cookie message of the day.
2194719	2195400	Can't forget that.
2195680	2195920	Nope.
2196161	2196941	Here it comes.
2197382	2198563	I just have to load it up here.
2200625	2204869	Boys and girls, here comes your fortune cookie message of the day.
2208092	2209474	Oh boy, this is a good one tonight.
2209534	2209794	Enjoy.
2216192	2216696	Dance, Loki.
2374980	2376101	Yay, that was fun.
2376161	2378202	Nelly finally taught me how to do the dance because I forgot it.
2378242	2379203	But, you know, it's just this.
2379843	2380664	Oh, wait, we're radio.
2381464	2383946	I'm hoping to get a webcam soon, though, again, so we can do that again.
2384767	2392472	The duck quacky beak with your hands, then you do the little chicken thing with your elbows, and then you do the twisty thing with your butt, and then you clap.
2393773	2395174	You clap because you just danced with your butt.
2395634	2396835	All right, thank you, guys.
2396895	2399537	And, yes, that was Loki's old FU music from a long time ago.
2399577	2402419	Those of you old school OLR fans remember that.
2402782	2403703	All right, that's it, guys.
2403803	2404944	We're taking off here.
2405024	2407687	Thank you guys so much for listening to us into this very late hour.
2408087	2409328	It's like 1230 on the East Coast.
2409348	2409889	You guys are nuts.
2410609	2411390	Probably morning time.
2411410	2412551	The sun's coming up over in Britain.
2413092	2414913	Thank you guys so much for listening and supporting us.
2414954	2416335	We really appreciate you guys' support.
2416595	2425624	Just so you know, podcast award nominations are coming up starting July 1st, and we're going to try and keep that within the independent radio community once again this year.
2425664	2428006	We're expecting a lot of competition from some of the corporate shows.
