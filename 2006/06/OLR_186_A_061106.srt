00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,080
Tonight, June 11th, 2006, Xbox gets updates and is the luminous release around the corner,

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,120
video game addicts get their own version of the Betty Ford clinic, and a game of solitaire

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,640
comes into play during the high-profile trial.

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,140
Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,300
of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,940
We are here to talk about all the news

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,220
that gamers really want to know about,

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,800
and we're here to help you through that.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,760
My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
You might know me as Sky.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,180
Joining me, as always, say hello to

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,380
the happiest bunny on the farm,

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,840
Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,960
Water, sandwich.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,520
Actually, I think I might start referring to her

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
the queen of the internet.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm not the queen of the internet, I'm the goddess of the internet.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
No, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
That's right.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Bow down.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Watch that ego there.

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Alright.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
What ego?

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
I'm just kidding.

26
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
It's only explosive.

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Alright.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Over there, say hello to the other queen of the internet.

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Loki!

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
I'm not a queen.

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
I know you're not.

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Sorry.

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
That would be Rob, the queen of the internet.

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,140
Anyway, how you doing, Loki?

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,140
Tech master Loki.

36
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,140
I'm doing okay.

37
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,140
Yeah?

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,140
Yeah.

39
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,280
Do you want to start off the show by issuing any apologies this week?

40
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,380
No. You sure? Yeah. Because I know we got a

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,520
large sharpen emails this week. Oh because

42
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,920
Loki misstated, misrepresented some facts last week. Oh my god I made a mistake!

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,300
Oh my god they caught him! Oh! Big deal, you know.

44
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,220
I already sent emails to said people so

45
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,500
I have nothing more to say. You sure? I didn't notice the optical

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,040
audio out on, you know, every single cable that I own for the Xbox 360.

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,840
My bad. Big deal. That's it. That's the only mistake I made, though.

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,120
Ever. Ever.

49
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,200
I somehow doubt that, but we know that when Loki makes mistakes, the

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Mac fans will be there to catch him. That's always good. Oh, it wasn't about Macs.

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,440
I know it wasn't about Macs, but they're the ones that are looking to

52
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,040
get you the best they can. Anyway,

53
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,120
I noticed that, well, there was a story this week, too, but

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,160
Anyway, let's start off the show as we always start off the show talking about our gaming

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
weeks.

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Dark Sakura, start us off.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
How was your gaming week?

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,880
Oh, Dark Sakura has a mouth full of sandwich.

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Let's start with Loki then.

60
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
How was your gaming week?

61
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,520
I played a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

62
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,720
Been playing, what was it, Joel Quest for some reason because the achievements are easy.

63
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,600
And I don't know, the game was like really easy until like the last few levels then it

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
gets really frustrating.

65
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,160
It's really, they didn't really kind of, I don't know, balance out the difficulty over

66
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
the course of the game.

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,700
It should be getting, you know, increasingly harder as it goes along.

68
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,600
Not just easy, easy, easy, hard, you know.

69
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,560
So I didn't think they did that very well.

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,240
And it's really a crap shoot whether it's easy or not because, like, the level I just

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,700
played a few minutes ago, you know, I played about four times before and I couldn't pass

72
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,500
it because it was just impossible to get the blocks in the right positions.

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,140
you know I started up and boom it's super easy I finish it like in no time

74
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,140
luck plays a huge role exactly it's just it's stupid but whatever so I've been

75
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,940
playing that and I played a little bit of crystal quest as well and that was

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,300
meh got a couple achievements on that and ghost recon a little bit just trying

77
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,840
to co-op stuff which is weird because we finished the co-op missions but we

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,040
We didn't get an achievement for it, which is dumb, even though you're supposed to.

79
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
I don't know.

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,960
Maybe sign back on or something, because sometimes if the game doesn't pick up your achievement

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,760
right away when you sign back on it will give it to you.

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,000
That happened to me in Uno.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,920
Like I was missing two achievements I should have had, and I just went back in the game

84
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,320
later and it gave them to me, just right off the bat pretty much.

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
It was weird.

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,920
Yeah, I don't know.

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,800
And then when I was playing some other game, I think it was like Neverending Warning or

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
something.

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,840
It's like some freeware PC game that someone made that's basically like these boss battles

90
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
one after another.

91
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
So Shadow of the Colossus?

92
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,000
No, not necessarily like Shadow of the Colossus, more like Ikaruga, but just really simplified.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
It's just fun.

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,800
That sounds a lot like Neverending Story, which makes me think they should make a Neverending

95
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Story video game.

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
ever make a never-ending story? Yes, they did. Wasn't they? It was awful. It was a PC

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,560
game for a never-ending story 2 and it doesn't count. Yeah, that doesn't count. No wonder

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,240
it was bad. Yeah, well that movie had the Flash in it. Oh, the guy who played the Flash

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,240
on TV. I know, but, you know, they need to make a game based off the original. I guess,

100
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,000
I mean. Isn't that considered retro hip now? Like, you know, everything that's 20 years

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
old should be retro cool i love the 80s they need to my my mistake i had the name wrong it's actually

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,720
um not never-ending uh warning it was um warning forever because you know it's got to be engrish

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,520
so warning forever is the name of that so if you happen to find that freeware out there uh it's

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,240
pretty fun it's small ass game but fun um played a little bit new super mario brothers but i'm

105
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,160
really sick of that game I mean really sick of it and I don't know I are you

106
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,760
supposed to be able to unlock some like mini games because I've played it

107
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,800
through most of the game so far and nothing's unlocked it's all the same

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,320
ones that used to be on the Mario 64 I hear you do unlock others but I haven't

109
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,360
played it quite enough but there are some hidden secrets like have you gotten

110
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,880
to the two completely hidden worlds four and seven yet oh yeah those are easy to

111
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,920
get to, and they're on the map, but you might miss them if you don't look for them.

112
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm all the way through 7, I've played through, I've unlocked all those, but I haven't unlocked

113
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,640
any of the minigames, unless they're just multiplayer exclusive minigames that are brand

114
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,700
new to this, but I haven't seen anything new unlocked.

115
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,320
Well maybe some folks in chat room can help you out, which gives me a good opportunity

116
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,520
to introduce our chat room.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,320
If you're listening live on Sunday night, head on over there, it's www.orangelaungeradio.com,

118
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
click on chat.

119
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,980
We do have some comments relating to this.

120
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,740
Ion671 seems to agree with you, new Super Mario Brothers gets old fast, says that person.

121
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,320
DJPooEater says, I remember the Willow game, because we were talking about 80s movies,

122
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,940
and the Willow game on NES was badass.

123
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
I loved that game.

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,580
That game was really awesome.

125
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,980
For its time, it was an incredible game.

126
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,580
And Sakurina says they need to make World of Oregon Trail first, which references I

127
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,640
think an old joke we had a year ago.

128
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,580
We need to be released to the Guardian Legend.

129
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,580
We do.

130
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
We do.

131
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Who owns that?

132
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,480
Didn't we have this discussion a while back that somebody owns the rights to that that's

133
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,100
never going to make it a new version?

134
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Because Broderbund went under.

135
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
It's all on Wikipedia.

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Just go to Wikipedia.

137
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
All the answers are there.

138
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
That's what I remember.

139
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,900
I need to actually get an MSX.

140
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,700
And I play Blazing Angels multiplayer, which is fun.

141
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,040
Dog fighting during lunch.

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,080
The game, though, the only thing that's really disappointing about that game is that you

143
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,840
can't crash the planes into each other, which I think you should be able to do because they

144
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,720
have kamikaze planes in there, and that's what kamikaze planes do, is crash into things,

145
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,280
and the fact that you can't crash into another player, you know, on purpose, is kind of lame.

146
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,840
Alright, is that it for your gaming week?

147
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
That's it?

148
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,360
I guess I'll go, even though Dark Soccer is done with her sandwich, I'm cutting.

149
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,080
Let's see, my gaming week, it actually wasn't too exciting.

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,120
I've played some Burnout Revenge which I actually picked up like the week before

151
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,200
Fandame but I don't think I've talked about it on the show yet

152
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,140
because I didn't really play a whole lot of it until this week. I must say Burnout

153
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,620
Revenge on the 360

154
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,760
it looks really good although I don't know side by side by the Xbox games

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,880
which are also on widescreen it's not like

156
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,920
jaw-dropping incredible I mean it's good

157
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,400
but let's just say thankfully that game's not $60 and it's getting some

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,880
price cuts to a more reasonable amount so that's cool

159
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,120
I do think, though, that Burnout Revenge has a really well-done multiplayer mode.

160
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,880
I think multiplayer is a lot of fun to play.

161
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,620
The way it's set up and when you're crashing into people and doing the takedowns, it shows

162
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,080
you who your enemies are before the match and it's all like a movie, the way it presents

163
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
everything.

164
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,720
It gives you this running commentary on the top of the screen.

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,160
So-and-so has just crashed, so-and-so took down so-and-so.

166
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,800
It's neat the way it's all presented.

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,040
you hate though when you're playing the game and the camera switches and then you crash

168
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
into something when it switches back?

169
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Because the camera switched?

170
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Yeah.

171
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Yeah, it's a little bit annoying.

172
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
But you don't get that so much in multiplayer, because it can't really stop time as much

173
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,200
in multiplayer, because everybody's racing at the same time, so you don't really get

174
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
that.

175
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,760
Otherwise, pretty much more of the same.

176
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,880
I've also been playing new Super Mario Brothers DS.

177
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm not quite sick of that yet.

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,440
By the way, somebody in chat room there says, Ion671 says the new Super Mario games are

179
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,700
So that's where you unlock those is there the multiplayer games lame

180
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,600
They actually the multiplayer games are a hell of a lot of fun in there. You got to play them at least what they're

181
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,840
For multiplayer DS games are a lot of fun. So yeah, try it at least once for you knock it

182
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,680
Otherwise, you know, I'm still on jury duty if you were listening to last week's show

183
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,400
I've been on a jury and I still can't talk about the trial guys. Sorry, maybe it's supposed to be done early next week

184
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,680
So maybe I can talk about it next Sunday

185
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,680
But meanwhile, during the downtime, I've been playing Final Fantasy I still. It's a good game to play at the courthouse.

186
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
It keeps me busy when there's a lot, a lot of downtime.

187
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:46,680
So, that's pretty much it. I did buy off the Xbox Live Arcade WIC Fable of Souls just because they haven't released anything on Xbox Live Arcade in forever, so I decided to buy something I didn't have yet.

188
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,680
And I like the concept. It seems kind of neat so far.

189
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
It's pretty lame, isn't it?

190
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,960
I don't know. I don't know. I didn't think it was as bad as you said it was in the beginning

191
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,860
It seems like I'll have fun with it for a little while, but it's definitely a you know five ten dollar title

192
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,800
I think it's ten dollars on the and I couldn't see paying much more for it

193
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,280
It's definitely the type of thing you you know like a flash game so but it's cute. It'll entertain me for a little while

194
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

195
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,600
I

196
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,260
actually didn't really play much of anything this week you know I've had a

197
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,520
whole week where I've had the time off and I haven't really felt like playing

198
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,420
anything so I took a mini vacation from games this week except that I actually

199
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,240
moved a bunch of our game stuff around and we have a lot of game stuff at my

200
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,100
house oh yeah we almost got rid of a virtual boy why would you do that we're

201
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,760
gonna trade it for like help on a pinball machine we know we did get did I

202
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,580
say we got another pinball machine? We did. You've had some games this week. Well, yeah,

203
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,460
we got a Last Action Hero pinball machine, which actually has romantic significance for

204
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,480
me and Dan. Because when I used to work at GNC back in the day, but a big shock to me

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,680
working at GNC, when we used to take the deposit boxes right next to, at the time, a Godfather's

206
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,140
pizza and inside they had a last action hero and a snow brothers so we would

207
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,340
play lots and lots of broken last action hero and we play that machine like a

208
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:21,560
mofo so yeah I actually did play some judge dread pinball this week too it was

209
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,220
a pinball and Dan's getting our DS lights today oh that's right today

210
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,440
waiting for me when I totally forgot until I came into chat room this evening

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,120
and somebody was talking about it I forgot the DS lights had been released

212
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,320
today I was oh yeah I was gonna get one of those but I'm holding off this time

213
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,800
Nintendo is not gonna get my money and tell the new colors come out that I want

214
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,300
I actually want a white one do you yeah I'm in a way I'm gonna hold off for

215
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,880
something like maybe green purple hot pink we'll see it all depends what color

216
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,000
the Wii comes out initially because you know it's got a match yeah definitely

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
they're gonna have to match there's gonna be a white Wii which is probably

218
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,820
what we're gonna get a white Wii I wonder if they'll release like a combo

219
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:10,820
It sounds like something that would be done at Costco or Sam's Club, one of those stores where you could get a red Wii and a red DS Lite comboed together.

220
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:19,820
I know we have some stories coming up in the second half of the show that'll talk about functionality between the Wii and the DS, so it'll be kind of interesting to see if they start marketing the two systems together. So we'll see.

221
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,140
But, um, I did a little bit of, like, drawing. I did some Kingdom Hearts, actually, related

222
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:33,020
drawing over the week, but other than that, my week's been pretty bull.

223
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,580
I forgot that I played one more game. I played DDR this week. Yeah? I played... because we

224
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,300
went to Golf Land. We were going to go play miniature golf, but then we found out that

225
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,780
they're closing early because of, you know, the grad night thing. So, they wanted me to

226
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,540
play DDR where there's people playing the DDR machines except for Disney's Rave which

227
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,680
wasn't being played so I had to play Disney's Rave and I have no stamina anymore. Of course

228
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,820
I accidentally picked Twilight Zone on doubles which is a 10 and that's not fun especially

229
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
when you're out of shape. Yeah, how many more pounds do you weigh now than when you play

230
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,860
DDR religiously? Oh, I don't remember. But anyways, good escape. No, we went and played

231
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,000
Qs are instead though yeah I heard I heard extra for say you guys have gone

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,160
to Qs are good times beat the crap out of everyone like I normally do loser how

233
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
many games accuse our have you played in your life I don't even know I well over

234
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,480
a thousand right over 2,000 oh my god didn't you weren't you the one that had

235
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,440
bought a pack or was that somebody else no that wasn't me thinking about it but

236
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm glad I did as I know who was now somebody that we used to socialize with

237
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,000
a golf line actually bought one of those like vests the packs that's that's

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,640
hardcore all right let's get into some gaming news tonight if you're all done

239
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,560
right dark soccer I am now all right wait sorry these well you said you

240
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,120
didn't really play much this week so I'm not going to lie oh no no no no I take

241
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:05,480
that back I played the Neo Geo pocket color oh yeah what did you play on that

242
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,560
We keep it in the bathroom.

243
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,920
Not the Busta Move 2 that most Americans know.

244
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Neo Geo.

245
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
It's Puzzle Bobble.

246
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Yeah.

247
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Alright.

248
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,080
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

249
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
And I guess I will go ahead and start us off tonight.

250
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,920
Why are they talking about Bob Dole in the chat room?

251
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
That's what I want to know.

252
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I don't know.

253
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
The chat room gets so random sometimes.

254
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Bob Dole is a cyborg.

255
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
They get so random sometimes.

256
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Just let him be.

257
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,160
Anyway, Xbox 360 got some updates finally this week, as you guys may have noticed.

258
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,120
They released it on 6.6.6, which was a great day for Xbox 360 to get some new upgrades.

259
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320
Basically when you power on your Xbox and connect to Xbox Live, you'll have to download

260
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
the update.

261
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,840
It doesn't take very long at all.

262
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,240
Now you can download up to six games, or I'm sorry, six movies, demos, whatever at a time.

263
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,520
They've kind of re-laid out the store a little bit so that you can find stuff quicker.

264
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,680
They have more categories and I think they have some better sorting.

265
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,200
I still think they need to reorganize the store completely, like the way it's presented,

266
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,480
but at least they made improvements to the setup they've got, so I guess I can't complain

267
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,840
too much.

268
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,100
One of the things I noticed right off the bat was custom soundtracks they made a whole

269
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,080
lot better, because I use custom soundtracks quite a bit in Uno, which has some really

270
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,040
god-awful music, and even in Burnout.

271
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,220
I don't want to listen to the punk rock they've got in there, I want to listen to my own synth

272
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,240
pop and stuff when I drive in Burnout.

273
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,600
I noticed there's not a lot of, it doesn't stop and go like it used to, and even when

274
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,860
you quit out of the game and go back to the dashboard, the music keeps going, it's seamless.

275
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,400
So they really did make some improvements to custom soundtracks, I was pretty impressed

276
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
with that.

277
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,720
And it sounds like they also made some upgrades to the DVD player.

278
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,280
I noticed Xbox Live Arcade games load a lot faster, because what it does is when it's

279
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,200
scanning your drive for arcade games, it only does that once, like it used to do it twice,

280
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,160
it would do it once on the main menu, and then when you went in to actually select a

281
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,760
game, you'd watch all your games fill in again, now it kind of bypasses that, so it's kind

282
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
of nice.

283
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,000
So you can get to your games a little faster, especially when you have like 17 games like

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
I do in the Xbox Live Arcade, it's kind of nice.

285
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,540
If you want to see the full list of upgrades, because there's a whole bunch, DVD player

286
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,040
and all that stuff, head on over to Xbox.com and it's in their recent news.

287
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,620
And I downloaded it and I put this thing to the test, not just with the custom soundtracks,

288
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,760
I downloaded three trailers all at once and it worked great.

289
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,320
I even made the mistake... I powered off my machine while one was downloading and then I

290
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,480
thought, oh crap, that probably was not a smart idea because you're not supposed to

291
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,480
turn your machines off while it's writing to the hard drive, but I just kind of forgot it was

292
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,080
going.

293
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,400
But I turned it back on and nothing was wrong. It picked right back up and started

294
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,080
going again.

295
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,440
I wouldn't recommend you guys do this because you might hurt something, but

296
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,200
it's nice to know that it's not gonna, you know, kill your Xbox to

297
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,480
turn off the power once or twice while it's downloading.

298
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
So those are the updates.

299
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Loki, did you get a chance to check out the updates at all on your Xbox?

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,200
Well, I had the update anyways, but no.

301
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I didn't really play with...

302
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,520
I don't really use custom soundtracks just because I haven't loaded anything on there yet.

303
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,840
And when it comes to burnout anyways, I just normally forward to today.

304
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,680
And then there's like 40-some tracks in there of all crap.

305
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,600
And so I wish you...

306
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,720
I think there is a way I just have to go in there and you can actually sort what plays when and stuff, but...

307
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,640
Well, if you use, what I do is I stream over the Wi-Fi.

308
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,640
That's how I get the custom soundtracks. I stream my MP3 collection from the

309
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,720
computer using the, you know, Media Connect thing,

310
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
and I stream that over the Wi-Fi. And it works great. You can set up

311
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,520
playlists in Winamp,

312
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,360
and Xbox 360 will read those. And so that's how you can, like, set up custom

313
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,120
playlists. You can shuffle those, do whatever you want.

314
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,160
So it's pretty cool. I really like custom soundtracks. It's a

315
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,040
nice feature because some games have really bad music.

316
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,600
But I'll tell you what, nothing rocks like playing Uno

317
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,640
to Journey Greatest Hits. That was awesome.

318
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Anyway, DarkSagre, you have some more Xbox news for us?

319
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,760
I might! Well, please share. Of course I will. Guess what

320
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,800
is coming out on the Xbox 360? Street Fighter 2, eventually, I hope?

321
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,880
Tetris! Oh, well that's cool. Yep,

322
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,200
apparently THQ could get things settled and now we've got Tetris on the 360.

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,520
Yeah, there was a lawsuit last year

324
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,960
against the Tetris company, saying that they

325
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,560
had reached a contract about releasing the DS version.

326
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,800
So now we're getting it on the 360.

327
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,080
I think we already have it on the 360 in Japan. But not in

328
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,600
US and Europe. It's coming out actually both in the US and Europe. Why isn't it like

329
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,920
supposed to be coming out like, I mean I couldn't imagine that there's too much to

330
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,300
localize with Tetris.

331
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,400
But it's not so much a localization thing as a Nintendo has a Tetris game out

332
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,440
right now, so I think there's licensing, dispute-y things that have been going on

333
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,460
behind-the-scenes so but they released it first party yeah so they couldn't say

334
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,440
anything I just you know I hope it's good I haven't touched the Japanese

335
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,480
version I just I hope because the PlayStation Tetris so what was it

336
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,500
Tetris Plus or something like that the gelico did on the play state are they

337
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,520
even in business anymore I hope not because they ruined Tetris so horribly

338
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,200
on the PlayStation was awful that's pretty hard to do I know it's hard to

339
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,280
screw up Tetris but they the problem that they made is they they altered the

340
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,760
the most main of formulas to Tetris by having it be like this little guy that walked across

341
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
the top of the pieces that didn't want to hit the spot.

342
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,960
It was so stupid.

343
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
It was so, so stupid.

344
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,360
Alright, moving on, Loki, you have some more news on Xbox.

345
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:51,560
Yes, the creator of such wonderful games like Dead Rising and The Lost Planet, Keiji Inafune,

346
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:58,640
basically has come out saying, you know, the Xbox right now, they're up to about 60% of

347
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,680
the hardware features, they've got all the games, they're not using the 100% of the power

348
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
of the system yet.

349
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,880
Which, you know, I kind of figure anyways, because I mean, if they've already hit 100%

350
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,740
a year later that's pretty sad because I mean the games aren't that great right now. But

351
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,380
definitely you'll have to say that Lost Planet and Dead Rising look pretty next gen compared

352
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,340
to some of the other companies out there that are releasing some pretty crappy games, EA.

353
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,220
And I don't know, basically his comment was the more years you study a platform the better

354
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,980
you get. Some games you'll see in three to four years will be truly amazing. And pretty

355
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,820
much you can say the same thing about the PlayStation 3 but I mean that goes

356
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,560
with all game systems. I was gonna say it wasn't huge news because usually when

357
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,660
game systems first come out they aren't exactly reaching their full potential

358
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,060
well then you get lazy companies that just want to pork crap over you know

359
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:59,420
like EA not to say EA is the only one Activision but uh I don't know it's

360
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,740
pretty cool I just want to put out for the record I looked up Jellico on

361
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,640
Wikipedia and they are still in business, but their English website has like nothing

362
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,800
on it. It's just a picture in a placeholder, so I don't think they're making a lot, but

363
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
they're still around.

364
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,680
They're probably more of a developer now instead of publishing.

365
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,460
I mean, I hope they were. I'm going off memory, guys. I'm pretty sure they were the ones that

366
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
had made that, and see, now I need to look that up, too.

367
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,860
Well, I don't know.

368
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
Dead Rising looks awesome.

369
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
There it is, Tetris Plus. There it is, right there.

370
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,340
Dead Rising is gonna be

371
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,100
fuckin' great and

372
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Lost Planet, I wish it was coming out sooner

373
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,060
but uh...

374
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,080
you know, it's supposed to be coming out I think January

375
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,120
and that should be amazing. The demo's really cool.

376
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,080
It's not really my kind of game, but I can see where people are really into

377
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,040
it. It looked pretty.

378
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,440
Yeah. I wish I could have seen more than just the snow level. The whole thing's

379
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,580
not snow, is it? The whole thing is snow. Is it really? Yeah.

380
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,780
I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the snow theme.

381
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,260
I like to see different different areas but whatever I guess it fits in with the

382
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,780
story. There was a parking garage

383
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,820
okay without snow in it

384
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,180
fine whatever. Also hitting Xbox Live there's a new Rumble Roses demo out if

385
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,100
you want to check out Rumble Roses there's a

386
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,020
or I should say Rumble Roses double X is a demo is now up on Xbox Live as well as

387
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,780
brand new maps for perfect dark zero

388
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,060
these were things that

389
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,580
they were supposed to come out sooner there was even an announcement that went

390
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,660
out that they'd gone out

391
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,260
but then they got pulled up they're now out

392
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,420
there on xbox live marketplace they're out there now it's a plaza trench

393
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,340
rooftops and gas plant

394
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,860
for five hundred points about 625

395
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,140
if that interests you check that out on xbox live uh... perfect dark zero

396
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,760
just couldn't really get into that game either i don't know just

397
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,340
all the maps in the world won't make that a better game it's kinda one of

398
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,040
those games i'll go back to

399
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,180
maybe in a few months and try it again see if maybe I can kinda get it

400
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,420
but as far as first person shooters go I play so few of them anyway I mean Halo

401
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,360
is cool you know

402
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,260
Quake 3 but not Quake 4

403
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,180
but I don't know I just wasn't feeling perfect dark zero. We're in the age now

404
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,460
okay it's like you know 2006 we're approaching 2007

405
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,440
and yet companies can't grasp jump technology

406
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,020
the ability to jump in games is very important because we have feet

407
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,820
they do other things other than walk and run they can jump

408
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,580
and uh... maybe that should have been in perfect dark

409
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,220
uh... loki you have some more news about xbox live yeah uh... basically

410
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,580
there's a whole bunch of releases that were supposedly linked or leaked out

411
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,900
there from a magazine

412
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,100
uh... one of those of course uh... being street fire two which is supposed to be

413
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,260
coming out

414
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,040
uh... in july we hope i don't believe it anymore do i thought was june

415
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,800
June, July. I don't believe it anymore anyway. Forget it, it doesn't matter.

416
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,000
There's been so many release dates for that game,

417
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,320
it'll be out whenever they're ready. Yeah, exactly. I'm sick of speculating that date.

418
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,780
But then again, this is from a magazine and

419
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,980
if we've come to learn anything from magazines, they're printed way the hell

420
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,120
in advance and

421
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,880
obviously they don't know when they run into problems like lag online.

422
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,260
But anyways, it's supposed to be released at some point for 400 Microsoft points, which

423
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,140
is about $5.

424
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,580
Very interesting though because that's pretty cheap.

425
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,920
Some of the other ones that they've mentioned also, Luminous Live, which would release supposedly

426
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:38,040
sometime in August or September for 1,200 points, which is about $15.

427
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,720
That's quite expensive actually for a live game.

428
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Yeah, but it's luminous.

429
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
True.

430
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
I'm okay with it.

431
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,140
I think it's because of the licensed music in it also, that might be a big thing, licensed

432
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,140
music, licensed videos.

433
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,400
Wait until the game really comes out and see how much of that licensed music actually comes

434
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,600
with the game, because I'll bet you anything it'll be 200, 300, 100 points to download

435
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,960
Madonna, you know, whatever else they're planning on putting in there from other artists.

436
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,920
Those high name artists will probably cost a little money.

437
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,760
If there's profit to be made, Luminous will cost you even more money.

438
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,600
But you know, the game on the PSP costs $19.99, so you know, but of course on that one you

439
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,200
have the perk of, you have it on the go.

440
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,720
Some of the other ones that were confirmed though, and this is actually confirmed with

441
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,500
Namco, Pac-Man is going to be out sometime in August or September for 400 Microsoft points

442
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,560
or 5 bucks.

443
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,820
Also supposedly coming around the same time I believe was Frogger, supposed to be coming

444
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:44,560
out from Konami, also about the same price. And there's another Namco game too, I can't

445
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,640
remember. Was it Pac-Man or Galaxian? Galaxian was the other one, yeah. And then of course

446
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,400
some other ones that they mentioned. The Cameo hardcore package featuring more difficult

447
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:04,760
versions of the single player campaign and co-op campaigns, more skins and new leaderboards,

448
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,080
plus some more co-op competitive elements. That's supposed to be coming out in July

449
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,840
for 500 Microsoft points, or 625. Cloning Clyde, also in July for 800 Microsoft points,

450
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:24,040
or 10 bucks. And RoboBlitz, sometime in August or September for 800 Microsoft points, or

451
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
10 bucks.

452
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Alright.

453
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,840
Well, they need some games to come out in June, because there's only one Xbox 360...

454
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,040
Oh, two now, because one moved to June again.

455
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,160
What's that?

456
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,720
Over-G fighters.

457
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,400
Over-G fighters and MotoGP2006 are the only ones coming out

458
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,040
in June right now.

459
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,680
Comments from our chat room over at orangelauntrady.com.

460
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,560
Click on Chat.

461
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,160
Funny Dale says, if anything, Microsoft should give us 625

462
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,080
for making us play Perfect Dark.

463
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,200
DMN says, Skyrare refuses to use jump features in their

464
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,240
first-person shooters.

465
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,480
Interesting.

466
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,520
I wonder where that comes from.

467
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,360
All right, anyway, going over to DarkSakura,

468
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,340
who has some more news for us.

469
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,340
This one also relating to Xbox.

470
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,060
Yeah, there's a rumor out from an introversion

471
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,060
that Darwinia is going to be available on Xbox Live Arcade.

472
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,260
Really, some of the support for this

473
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,260
is that basically there's other versions of Darwinia out.

474
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,340
they said there's been talk actually from

475
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,820
Microsoft I think that they've been really wanting to use it

476
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,340
and there's been a lot of just

477
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,700
talk going around that says it's really gonna happen so see

478
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,340
I've heard a lot of good about Darwinia yeah it's a really popular indie title

479
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,740
and I know we've gotten emails on it even before and I've heard

480
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,740
discussion about the game on other shows so some of our listeners overseas

481
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,220
yeah and I'll be really cool for if that does hit Xbox Live you know that's huge

482
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,080
exposure for it

483
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,700
and it's a good marriage you know Xbox Live Arcade is supposed to be

484
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,040
set up to help out you know the indie developers so

485
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,560
hope it works out for them and give it some easy achievements for the

486
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,960
achievement points, Horace.

487
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,200
For those that like to do things to their Xbox 360s that could void the

488
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,960
warranty

489
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,800
yes there's some news yes of course mod chips coming out

490
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,480
finally this website devil 360

491
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,520
.com actually they were trying to release it on 666 but

492
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,440
weren't done in time, because they're actually trying to improve it right now to try to protect

493
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,520
it from any type of updates, make it programmable via PC, and able to boot unsigned code.

494
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:45,040
It will allow you to swap the hard drive with a larger drive using a special interface between

495
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,320
the 360 and the hard drive, and a lot more.

496
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,040
So basically they're saying that it's going to be due out probably sometime by the end

497
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:02,040
this year, but they're still working on it right now. But it's coming soon. Coming soon.

498
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,880
Won't Microsoft just put out a patch? It might be something that they might not be able to

499
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,880
patch because they may be able to, you know, I mean if you think about it, okay, Xbox,

500
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:23,360
the original Xbox, you know, they've got mod chips on those and stuff. I don't know. I'm

501
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,460
I'm sure they'll try to figure out a way, but then again, you know, it's a battle back

502
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
and forth.

503
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
So, we'll see.

504
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
Alright.

505
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,720
Going back to the chatroom, orangeontrader.com, click on chat.

506
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,720
We have some comments on Darwinia from our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf from All Games.

507
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,140
He says, I don't think Darwinia can work on an Xbox 360 controller.

508
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,640
I love Darwinia, but it needs a mouse and keyboard.

509
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,120
Well, don't forget, you can hook in a keyboard in your Xbox 360, kind of like Final Fantasy

510
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,920
11 on the Xbox 360.

511
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:59,260
You can play it with a controller, but I really wouldn't recommend it.

512
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,660
You can use the controller if you have really good macros set up.

513
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,280
But even to put in the macros, you really need a keyboard to do all that, and to chat

514
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
with people.

515
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
I mean, if you ever want to chat.

516
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,780
I mean, you can get away with most of the basic elements using good macros with a controller,

517
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,460
but you really need a keyboard for that game.

518
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,380
By the way, DarkSakura, in the, you know, because you always like to call me addict,

519
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,140
when I talk about Final Fantasy XI, I've not played all week.

520
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,220
I'm so proud!

521
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
In fact...

522
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
I actually haven't played any Ragnarok.

523
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,820
In fact, here's the thing, um, don't tell Miklotov, because I don't think he listens

524
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,900
to the show anyway, but I'm going to be in big trouble, I sign back up for World of Warcraft.

525
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,980
Just shaking my hand.

526
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,060
You can play with me now because I'm still noob level.

527
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:46,220
I joined some server extra for Zaun, something about get the characters to level 19 and do

528
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,020
nothing but battlegrounds is what they're wanting to do him and some other

529
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,020
friends are with me to also I'll do one that's you know all the way to level 60

530
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,420
if I if I stick with the game that long what's your real scarlet crusade for my

531
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:03,280
Alliance and bronze beard for my horde we'll see I'm on that elder thallus is

532
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,860
the one I'm working with the level 19 on I might I might make one on there my

533
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:13,580
characters are still you know new level we'll see all right moving on what gonna

534
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:20,100
to go to the Nintendo Wii. Best Buy has listed Nintendo Wii games for pre-order.

535
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,700
And actually I'm checking the link right now to see if they're actually still up.

536
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,740
Yes, sure enough they are. It shows Red Steel, Super Mario Galaxy, and Super

537
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,580
Smash Brothers Brawl all coming out December 1st, 2006. And if you believe

538
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,860
those release dates, you're an idiot. Obviously those release dates are

539
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,100
just in the system to try and get pre-orders moving, you know, amongst some

540
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,360
of those really hotly talked about games such as Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

541
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,500
I really don't know why this is news, but just for those people that think these are

542
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,420
actual release dates and this points to, oh the Wii is coming out December 1st, no.

543
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,360
The Wii will be out before the day after Thanksgiving.

544
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,980
So I should say the Wii will be out before Thanksgiving, it has to be.

545
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,940
And if you've been listening to this show for the past few weeks, we're even convinced

546
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,220
it's mid-October, you know, whether we're right or wrong, whatever, we'll see.

547
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,040
it has to be out before Thanksgiving.

548
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,580
Yeah, it's probably going to be out before the...

549
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,180
Definitely going to be out before the PS3.

550
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,420
Well, that's right. One of the Nintendo bigwigs said that before, right?

551
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,780
I would think it's definitely because, well,

552
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,600
when you think of console systems and stuff,

553
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,820
which one's hardware is pretty much done?

554
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,620
Okay, that's a...

555
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,660
I'd be surprised if the PS3 launches

556
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,100
on the date that they said it will.

557
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,940
I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't launch until next year.

558
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,620
Not to say you know they

559
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,000
they can't pull it off and it could be a really great system with lots of cool

560
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,540
games

561
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,660
but they're gonna be working some massive overtime over it. But they're gonna seriously need

562
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,700
like the help of some leprechauns you know to make this thing happen.

563
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,780
We'll see, we'll see. You know what, don't count Sony out yet so what if they

564
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,820
kinda lost E3 so to speak you know they could come back and Sony fanboys

565
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,500
I know that in the back of their mind. I think the best interest of Sony right now is to

566
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,540
get all of their upper, you know, people

567
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,900
to stop saying stupid shit. That's what they need to do. Actually,

568
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,860
maybe Sony could benefit from a gag order.

569
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,500
Like, kinda like Nintendo has, kinda, sorta. Nintendo doesn't really, but Nintendo

570
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,260
they don't let out a lot of secrets. Or when they do let out secrets,

571
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,980
it's very carefully timed

572
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,780
the way they do it. So, I don't know. Alright, anyway.

573
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:39,260
because Nintendo hires smart people yeah anyway moving on to some release dates

574
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,660
that we do know about

575
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,860
dark soccer you like to travel the globe and tell our buddies in Europe

576
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,100
what they have to look forward to and some well not very exciting things

577
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,860
unless you're a PC gamer I guess

578
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:57,060
Copa Inata is coming out on PC ship simulator 2006

579
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,740

moving over stateside, Loki you know any

good releases for the US coming up there's actually some pretty cool stuff

586
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,540
and one of them I'm definitely getting this week

587
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,740
point-blank for the DS is coming out finally

588
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:36,040
On the Game Boy Advance, if you're a fan of the Mega Man Battle Network games, Mega Man

589
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,400
Battle Network 6, Falzar and Gregar are going to be both coming out.

590
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:49,760
Also coming out on PC we've got Darwinia, Ultimate Quake, Rush for Berlin, Rise and

591
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:57,600
Fall of Civilizations at War, Deep Sea Tycoon, a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff.

592
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,840
Also on Playstation 2, of course, Armored Core Last Raven, Street Fighter Alpha Anthology,

593
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,960
and Urban Chaos Riot Response, which is also coming out on Xbox.

594
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,220
And then for the PSP, you've got the Metal Gear Solid digital graphic novel, which is

595
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,600
coming out in 360, MotoGP 2006.

596
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,160
Alright, moving on, we were talking about the Playstation 3 a little bit ago, and of

597
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,240
course one game a lot of folks are looking forward to on the Playstation 3 is Metal Gear

598
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,480
Solid 4, and there was some new details about Metal Gear Solid 4 announced in a very recent

599
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
interview.

600
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,920
Hideo Kojima said that there's a new camo suit that Snake's going to have.

601
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,720
It's the Octocam, and what this will do is it will change shape and color to match the

602
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,400
surroundings that Snake has.

603
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,040
These chameleon effects are going to happen automatically whenever Snake is resting.

604
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
So it sounds kind of interesting.

605
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,800
It could be a graphically impressive sort of event, so we'll see.

606
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,780
So Kojima's dropping little hints left and right about Metal Gear Solid 4, just enough

607
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,940
to remind the fans it's coming out and they better be supporting Playstation 3 like it

608
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
or not.

609
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,820
Loki here's another game that as the release date gets pushed back and pushed back it's

610
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,740
harder and harder to support but the fans love it.

611
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:21,820
Okay basically Take 2 has said that Duke Nukem Forever will be out by December 31st.

612
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,820
That's a bold statement. You mean it this time? Do you really mean it this time?

613
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Well, they've got an incentive now. As it was, they're not giving the full funding for the game.

614
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:40,820
I believe originally it was $6 million. Now they're down to $4.25 million.

615
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:49,820
And there's a $500,000 incentive assuming that 3D Realms actually finishes the game on time.

616
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,720
on time, wow, on time would have been like 10 years ago

617
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,180
so supposedly

618
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,360
the PC version will be out by the end of the year

619
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,520
that's mighty breath to hold right there

620
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,120
this game better kick ass seriously

621
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,680
with all this anticipation and all this waiting that's gone to do it

622
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,960
this game better kick some ass so we can all you know eat our words we've been

623
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,000
bashing all these delays it better be worth it

624
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,360
this game will have to be better than sex

625
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,800
this game will have to do my laundry seriously so

626
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,560
whether or not it'll come out I don't think anyone cares at this point

627
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,020
now I I don't know you know what Duke Nukem 3D

628
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,000
lot of love for that game even even what 10 years later after the game was

629
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,400
released

630
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,200
still a lot of love for that game there's there's people out there that'll

631
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,760
support it

632
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,320
put it on the goddamn Xbox Live Arcade what Duke Nukem 3D?

633
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,000
Hell yeah. That would actually be pretty sweet. Do you think realistically that would ever happen?

634
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,680
No. But it could. I mean the game's small enough

635
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,080
and well I would imagine that the Xbox 360 would have the power to

636
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,160
I don't know play that game so

637
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,960
I think it could be cool. They should have done the same thing with Quake 2 instead of

638
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,920
releasing it with

639
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,840
Quake 4. I think that could have been pretty cool.

640
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,840
let's see in reference to a topic we were talking about earlier Jeremy Todd

641
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,440
one says Duke Nukem is the never-starting story

642
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,360
get it because we had never-ending story around get it?

643
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,240
and now everybody's talking about

644
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,360
vaporware so to speak fireboma says hey guys let's go play on our phantoms

645
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,000
actually phantoms are coming out well yeah but so is Duke Nukem forever

646
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,400
yeah but I'm saying that they've I mean even though they kept pushing back the date

647
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,680
they actually did have a date

648
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,640
set for release. Okay and yeah sure they'll hit that you know well we'll see

649
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,080
maybe they will and we can all...

650
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,560
I say at the end of the year it goes and it hasn't released at that point I'll consider it vaporware.

651
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,080
Alright. Like I'm actually gonna

652
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,680
care about getting one but you know. Quicksilver over in our chat room is

653
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,280
saying I want Mortal Kombat on Xbox Live Arcade.

654
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,840
They are coming out with Mortal Kombat 3 or it's either

655
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,000
Mortal Kombat 3 or Ultimate Mortal Kombat or one of those.

656
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,320
Why can't they put out the only good one they had, which was Mortal Kombat 2?

657
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,600
I... I don't know. Maybe because, well, see...

658
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,760
Mortal Kombat 3 was like when the series started to go crappy.

659
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,040
Mortal Kombat 2 is available on the, you know, Midway packs or whatever, but then

660
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,560
again, so is Mortal Kombat 3, but I don't think,

661
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,200
I could be wrong, but I don't think Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was available in

662
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,920
those, like,

663
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,320
Midway treasures or whatever it was called, and plus you can play them online

664
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,440
either, which is a huge

665
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,680
perk to being able to play its base all it is is that you know cuz Street

666
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,960
Fighters coming out Mortal Kombat has to come out it's

667
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,640
it's the one of the greatest video game competitions ever Street Fighter vs

668
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,400
Mortal Kombat

669
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,240
you know we need is a new killer instinct good luck

670
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,560
I know that would make me so happy. That would make me happy too. I was a Killer Instinct fangirl.

671
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,360
good luck yeah they take up jump feature in that one too

672
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,680
shush alright we're gonna

673
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,640
go over to our mailbag over at mailbag.orangelauntrader.com is our email address and Dark Soccer likes

674
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,560
to dig through the mailbag. She's going to put on her hazmat suit and pull out some emails

675
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,160
and share them with us so we can taunt your emails live on air. No, just kidding. We love

676
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,280
getting mail of all types. Even the hate mail we got this week, thanks to Loki's uninformed

677
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,800
statement on Xbox sound support last week. Good job, Loki.

678
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Yeah, whatever.

679
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,320
All right. Dark Soccer, what's in the mailbag?

680
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,080
The first one comes from Kurt, one of our listeners.

681
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,600
He's like, hey, I was wondering if you guys could fill me in on the rules that Sony may

682
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,060
have regarding how many PS3s each person will be allowed to buy, or is there only one per

683
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,060
household allowed?

684
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,600
Will people be selling the PS3 on eBay for megabucks like the PS2 and the Xbox 360?

685
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,880
I'm sure.

686
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,680
Yeah, I'm sure they will.

687
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,240
I'm sure they'll be selling as many as they can possibly sell.

688
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,840
I don't think Sony sets those limits though, right?

689
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Does it?

690
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Retailers?

691
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,680
The retailers, how many they can sell to make sure that they fit all the orders.

692
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,080
Yeah, retailers will be setting those limits, and most retailers, if the PS3 is a hot commodity,

693
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,440
will have the one limit.

694
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,120
And probably at launch, Sony's, I think Sony's still gonna pull out an Ace somehow, they're

695
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,560
gonna make this work somehow and have at least one title out there that the fanboys are gonna

696
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,640
have to have.

697
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,240
I still say if you're gonna buy one, pre-order it.

698
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,560
Get down a reserve on it.

699
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,200
That is the smart way to do it.

700
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,400
And like all of you people who tried to go in and buy your Xbox 360 on launch day, haha!

701
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:33,520
count on E3's bust, you know, for Sony, essentially, to be meaning that, you know, they're gonna

702
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
be easy to get.

703
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,040
The stores are only gonna get limited quantities, if you don't pre-order it, I doubt you're

704
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
gonna get one on launch day.

705
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,360
Well it doesn't matter anyways, cause you're not gonna get one on launch day even if you

706
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
do pre-order it.

707
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,000
I mean, remember the 360, people were getting them in March?

708
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,720
Yeah, but they're supposed to be altering- The people who pre-ordered theirs first got

709
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
theirs first.

710
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,740
They're supposed to be altering that, so it doesn't happen this time either, you're supposed

711
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,160
to only be- you can't pre-order them right now.

712
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,940
If last year you could have pre-ordered a 360 right now, you know, at this time last

713
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:02,660
year, but they're not doing that with the PlayStation 3 because they learned their lesson.

714
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,820
At least the big, big retailers, GameStop and EB Games, as far as games go.

715
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,860
All right, more mail.

716
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:16,500
Another of our listeners asked if we know of any upcoming DDR games for PS2.

717
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,980
DDR Supernova.

718
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Supernova.

719
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,980
Yep.

720
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,580
And that's pretty much the only one here in the States.

721
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,540
I'm sure UK is getting Dancing Stage Supernova as well.

722
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:30,900
DDR Supernova, there's actually a little in-depth look on our website and I think it's still

723
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
on the front page.

724
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,380
I don't think it's rolled off yet over at www.orangetonshooter.com and there's video

725
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,660
of it in motion and everything.

726
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,300
That was from John, by the way.

727
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,300
Yes.

728
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,300
Thank you, John.

729
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,720
But yeah, that's pretty much all there is to look forward to as far as DDR goes on Supernova.

730
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,440
So far for the past, what, five years now, Konami's been putting out pretty regularly

731
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,320
a new DDR game every year on Sony's platform, so you can count on probably another one next

732
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,360
year as well, unless for some unknown reason, Supernova doesn't sell, but I really don't

733
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
see that happening.

734
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,840
I think it'll sell just as well as the other games, if not better.

735
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:09,440
Next one up is JVMon, who I am very, very proud of, writing a letter to the senator.

736
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,520
Oh yes, I remember talking about that on a previous episode.

737
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,280
And basically, just in closing, said, so any help and input would be greatly appreciated,

738
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,000
and I love OLR, Sky and Dark Stalker,

739
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,160
you inspired me to write my senator.

740
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,920
Oh yeah, and Loki is awesome.

741
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,700
But yeah, I'm not gonna go into it

742
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,900
because it's fairly long already,

743
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,560
but the arguments are basically what we've been talking about

744
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
about the parent's responsibility

745
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,800
to decide what their children do.

746
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,920
Yeah, and we don't want to put the pen to the paper for you.

747
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,400
I would say the only suggestions we really have

748
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,920
is just be professional,

749
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,840
and make sure you sound professional, and you're not.

750
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,440
And research your points.

751
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,200
Yeah, best you can, I mean if you've been listening to, you read enough video game websites

752
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,520
especially things like game politics that really have their eye on these types of things

753
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,800
and listen to enough shows, you probably are well educated on the subjects.

754
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Just write maturely.

755
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,600
If you're trying to, I say if you're trying to refute an argument though, have facts to

756
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,920
back up while you're refuting it and what's gonna, that's what I meant, have the facts

757
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,240
there to support your argument.

758
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,400
Yeah, please don't write your senator a letter that says, dear senator, I am a registered

759
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,000
voter fuck you you fucking fuck don't do that because that's just gonna get

760
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,320
thrown away and you'll probably laugh at you yeah so you need to write something

761
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:30,800
mature so we got an email from I'm going to hopefully pronounce this right to set

762
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:38,320
a prairie I guess it's also I think in our chat room right now hi um but

763
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:47,640
So basically asking, you know, what would be better to get, a MacBook or a Windows desktop.

764
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,640
And uh...

765
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,680
Is he just trying to start an argument on this show?

766
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,680
Yeah.

767
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,440
This is very, very serious.

768
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:01,320
And basically, and I actually responded back with my opinion on it, um, I say it all depends

769
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
on what you're going for.

770
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,500
If you want something that's going to be a good work-oriented computer, something that

771
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,320
can run your programs well on, something you can do graphics in well, something that you

772
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,840
can write on well, something that you can basically use as a work system, Mac is the

773
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,280
way to go. Something that's going to be on a more professional level. If you want something

774
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,440
that you can play games on and just futz around on the internet with, PC is the way to go.

775
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,320
My advice, try before you buy. Any computer store, you know, if you're going to make a

776
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,800
major purchase like that, any major computer store is going to have the computers out there

777
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,640
on the show floor, especially like the Apple store, you know, they encourage people to

778
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,520
be playing on their Macs, and any type of big retailer for PCs, Best Buy, Fry's, whatever,

779
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,120
they have laptops out on the floor.

780
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,120
Try before you buy.

781
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
Take all the time you need.

782
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
Don't rush to the decision.

783
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,120
I'll see you at Bar Mitzvah on Saturday, so.

784
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Mazel tov.

785
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
Mazel tov.

786
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
All right.

787
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,080
So I just thought that would, you would go ahead and give you our public yay.

788
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,080
All right.

789
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Congratulations.

790
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,080
Yep.

791
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,280
Jeremy Todd writes in, just to read the letter, I just want to thank you for giving me something

792
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,380
to listen to during work to help make the hours go by faster, my job is a pretty boring

793
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,300
job at times, we won't tell your boss, and having something to listen to really helps

794
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,300
a lot.

795
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,620
I have been downloading a few older episodes of OLR and listening to them while I'm at

796
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,620
work.

797
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,420
So thank you for providing such a good podcast to listen to in desperate times.

798
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,320
You're welcome.

799
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,020
We do this show for fun and we always get a kick out of the fact that people listen

800
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,460
to this and provide feedback and all that stuff, so it really keeps us motivated.

801
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,460
So thank you.

802
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:37,080
I also got an email from Tony, and I haven't had a chance to watch the file yet, so I'm

803
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,520
just going to read the email.

804
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,400
It says, I just watched a rerun of the Colbert Report on Comedy Central for June 8th.

805
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,520
I know you don't watch a lot of TV, so I'll forgive you for that, it's actually the Colbert

806
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Report.

807
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Colbert, okay, I don't watch TV.

808
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,320
I know you don't watch TV, but.

809
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,720
Steven's guest explains how video games are actually helping this generation of kids and

810
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:00,440
implies that GTA might contribute to this nation's decrease in carjackings in teen pregnancies.

811
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,680
It's all done, the show is a parody, essentially, of shows like The O'Reilly Factor, and so

812
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,520
it's all very tongue-in-cheek when they do that stuff.

813
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,520
It's still a point, though.

814
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,880
Yeah, I could see how, like, maybe World of Warcraft would lead to the decline of, you

815
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,160
know, pregnancy because they're too busy playing the video game in order to, I don't know,

816
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
have sex.

817
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,040
It's like, well, we could have sex right now, but, ugh, we got an instance in two minutes.

818
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,040
Video game!

819
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,040
God!

820
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,720
But also, um, there's an interview with, uh, Steven Johnson, he says it's currently on

821
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,920
the front page but you may have to do a search on it if it gets bumped to the

822
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:40,680
video archives later sex or an instance sex or an instance any time an instance

823
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,840
is in like two minutes I don't know it depends on you sometimes sex is an

824
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,320
instance but hey all right that's it all right if you want to send us emails

825
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,800
please do a mailbag at orange lounge radio comm Loki speaking of MMOs and

826
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,480
sex and instances. What a good follow-up. You've got a story for us.

827
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,280
Yes, lots of gamers are finding love online in fake virtual worlds like World of Warcraft

828
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:14,520
and whatnot. Anyways, a survey conducted by Stanford University's Nick Ye, a PhD student

829
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,440
there, found that 29% of women and 8% of men have gone on dates with people that they've

830
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:28,440
met in the games. And he attributes that phenomenon to the trust building exercises of working

831
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,680
in team scenarios. How one player acts during an in-game raid may reveal traits relative

832
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,960
to the avatar's personality through situations that are less common in the real world. So

833
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,720
say for example we would take Leroy Jenkins. He might rush into things a little bit too

834
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:55,560
quickly might not be a good mate but I don't know but anyways it was

835
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,560
interesting to mention you know one guy was you know set up for two weddings one

836
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:08,280
in real life and one in game. NERD! Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know I met my husband online. You know

837
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:14,800
through our geekdom. No I realized in this day and age that we live in the

838
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,940
internet is the place you know is a place that we can meet people like

839
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,860
remember back in the day like maybe if you have an older brother sister they

840
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,120
talked about like party lines that you could call into on the phone that's what

841
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,840
chat rooms are it's party lines basically people you know it's just a

842
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,520
new way to do I don't know ever sex is like phone sex to you but when you throw

843
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,320
those ones that you get from real life when you throw the MMO into it it does

844
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,280
get a little weird I mean you know because people are like role-playing

845
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,220
playing elves and dwarves and all that so well you're a hot elephant I came but

846
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:50,480
now you're a fat cow so I don't know this kind of mixes things up a bit but

847
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,060
at the same time you know I'm not gonna knock two people falling in love if it's

848
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,380
genuine you know what loves a great thing doesn't matter how it happened

849
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:05,340
whatever I actually I had dance high school photo to go on when we first met

850
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:10,220
and keep in mind I was 22 when I moved out here you guys that long ago

851
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:18,320
But, um, you know, but we, I, I, I thought it was great because we actually got to know

852
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:25,820
each other as people without having, you know, the whole, you know, visual thing that everybody

853
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,940
else has to deal with.

854
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,100
We actually, you know, we talked on the phone, we, we got to know each other as people and

855
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,720
then that only, I think, made things a lot better for us, you know, when, you know, when

856
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,920
we actually did get together.

857
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,120
you know now we're very happily married and have pinball machines and a cat I do

858
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,600
think it is important though to make sure that the person that you're talking

859
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,520
to is not looking like a yeti I mean that is very important I don't think it

860
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,040
matters what the other person looks like as long as their heart is good and you

861
00:50:54,040 --> 00:51:02,000
love them for them yeah yeti people need love to Loki come on it doesn't mean you

862
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,600
have to love them but you know you know somebody might have a yeti fetish you

863
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,760
don't know. Well there are furry fetishes out there. I think it's really sad though

864
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,720
just how much people base their whole relationship on oh well this person's

865
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,520
hot or oh well this person is this you know aesthetically instead of actually

866
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,840
putting the importance on who they are on the inside and so I think that I

867
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,040
honestly think that you open yourself up for a lot of risk however if you do

868
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,560
happen to hit pay dirt then you're gonna get someone who I think is a bit you

869
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,680
know I think that you have a chance of getting a more genuine person and when

870
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,920
you do find somebody all right yeah well you know I thought if I'm looking for

871
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,660
you know a good running car or whatever I don't want one that's like all beat up

872
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:53,300
on the outside actually um I just got it I am from somebody who was said that two

873
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,860
of her friends met on World of Warcraft and got married three months ago Wow

874
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:03,180
Well, I didn't mean it like that. But wow, okay. Well, you know what I

875
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,580
Like I said, you know, it might be weird to me

876
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:12,260
But love is a crazy thing and you know

877
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,220
I'm not gonna argue if two people are in love as long as they're not being stupid about it, you know

878
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,820
Who cares how they met, you know?

879
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:25,240
Let them do whatever they want. They want to roleplay Torrance and orcs in the bedroom. Have fun. Do your thing

880
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,180
Just you know don't don't put it on the end. Don't put it on YouTube

881
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,900
I don't want to see it

882
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:34,700
But still I think that you need people who meet through online methods whether it be an MMO whether it be

883
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,740
You know do a chat through a message board if it works for you more power to you fishing core bar

884
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,860
You know what picking up people to bar is pretty scummy

885
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:49,100
No, not always not always, but you know what a lot of times. It can be bars are pretty sleazy sometimes

886
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,100
I mean you know what?

887
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,460
meet people at church that's the only clean place

888
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,220
that's not a clean place church going people

889
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,260
no alright let's see

890
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,340
Bob in our chat room says well what about those balloon fetish people pop a

891
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,900
balloon and they'll be all over you

892
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,740
I have a feeling someone missed the point there that's alright

893
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:15,060
dirty thief said someone's gonna bang a chocobo

894
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,380
and in reference to you know doing the MMOs

895
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,460
sex in the MMOs boy you kids have a lot of free time

896
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:27,540
moving on if you do play too many video games

897
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,080
you might need to take a trip to the Netherlands because they have set up an

898
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,300
addiction center

899
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:38,300
it's the first detox clinic for video game addicts

900
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:43,420
video games may look innocent but they can be just as addictive as gambling or

901
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,340
drugs and just as hard to kick

902
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,660
says Keith Bakker, director of Amsterdam-based

903
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,620
Smith and Jones Addiction Consultants. He's already

904
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,740
treated 20 video game addicts aged 13 to 30.

905
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,180
Some of them will show withdrawal systems, shaking, sweating,

906
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,340
whatever. His detox program begins in July.

907
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,540
It runs four to eight weeks and has therapy sessions,

908
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:10,920
wilderness excursions, healthy lifestyle workshops, and possibly

909
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,460
medication. Let's see, another quote here from

910
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,340
We have kids who do not know how to communicate with people face-to-face because they have

911
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,980
spent the last three years talking to somebody in Korea through a computer.

912
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,940
Their social network has completely disappeared.

913
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,060
Hey, they cannot be blaming this on Korea.

914
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,740
It is not the Koreans fault.

915
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,140
Let us see if we can have a testimony here from one of the folks here.

916
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,140
Let us see.

917
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:43,680
We have Heik van der Heijen who is 28 and a graduate of the Amsterdam side of this.

918
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,960
He started playing video games when he was 8, and by the time he was in college he was

919
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,960
gaming 14 hours a day and using drugs to play longer.

920
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,760
That's a whole other problem.

921
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,240
That's not a gaming problem.

922
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,240
That's a whole other problem.

923
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,280
That's called obsessive compulsive disorder.

924
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,240
Does that count as cheating on live, you know?

925
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,880
Getting coked up before playing, I think it might be.

926
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,080
Like if I'm on speed, I have that advantage over the...

927
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,080
Can I say the quote please?

928
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,640
Here's the quote from the kid.

929
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,540
For me, one joint would never be enough, or five minutes of gaming would never be enough.

930
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,860
He said, I would just keep going until I crashed out.

931
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,860
Okay, so when I first read about this story, I was kind of laughing at it, because my thought

932
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,780
went to, you know, I've been downtown all week at the courthouse during the jury duty,

933
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:34,460
and one of the things I walk by is a, I don't want to knock religious, I'm not going to

934
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:40,380
name what religion it is, but you go by a very religious type of, like a store type

935
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:46,300
and they have in the window, do you have a gaming addiction problem?

936
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,700
It's listed in the list and it's like, are you addicted to sex, violence, gaming?

937
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,820
And I was kind of like, oh boy, you know, I just kind of roll my eyes at it and keep

938
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:58,380
on walking, but you know, these guys that I'm reading about in this story, they really

939
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,700
do have problems and do need some type of intervention.

940
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,020
So maybe this isn't such a bad idea as it seems.

941
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:07,180
I think the media is just kind of putting a spin on this story, where you know, it's

942
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,900
about you know it's gaming they're just they're obsessed with gaming and gaming

943
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,660
is the problem no these guys obviously have a lot of other problems something

944
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,660
underline aiming just contributes to when you start reading these tests I

945
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,100
mean if he was doing drugs too that's a whole nother problem he was getting

946
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,620
saving just wouldn't have any of these problems so the moral of the story kids

947
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,460
you know what it was one of the treatments here wilderness excursions

948
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,420
it's very easy you can go on your own wilderness excursion here's what you do

949
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,700
after you've played the game like if you've played the game for more than

950
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,180
like four hours the day it's time to go outside for an hour walk around breathe

951
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,200
in some fresh air take a wilderness excursion and don't let this become you

952
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,140
I don't know wilderness excursions are good idea how do you think LARP's came

953
00:56:48,140 --> 00:57:02,100
around I mean do we really need more of that oh my gosh it's the same as like

954
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:06,380
going to reenactments is it reenactments actually have historical

955
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:14,460
significant oh snap and ridiculous three an act of civil war but this time the

956
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,940
south one again I'm not one to knock what somebody else is into but I did go

957
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,540
to a ren fair once and kind of roll my eyes at it I'm sorry it just wasn't for

958
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,540
me but I'm not gonna there is fun I'm not gonna knock people at you whatever

959
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:31,500
you know do you know about getting your pine of ale and ready for adding up the

960
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,000
Maybe the Ren Faire I went to just sucked.

961
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,360
Ren Faire is just like an old fashioned Hooters.

962
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,340
Lots of boobs, lots of chicken, I mean that's basically what it is.

963
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,960
So there's nothing wrong with a Ren Faire.

964
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,120
Plus you get to see people fight with swords, and that's kind of cool.

965
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:55,720
That's the only thing missing from Hooters is sword fighting.

966
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,560
Sometimes I wonder why we have you on the show, Loki, and then you say little gems like

967
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,960
that to remind me.

968
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,320
Let's go to another story now, actually I'm curious what the chat room has to say in feedback

969
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:13,580
to the detox story here, let's see, Raven's Dolphin says they need an OLR clinic, I am

970
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:18,260
addicted, well that's lovely, but just remember you can put Orange Lawn's Radio on your iPod

971
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:22,700
or whatever mp3 player you have and you can go outside and take a walk and listen to Orange

972
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,380
Lawn's Radio if you wanted to.

973
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,300
Alright, Loki, you have another story for us.

974
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:32,940
Yes, it's about the Federal Trade Commission and their never-ending quest to waste my tax

975
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:42,100
money. Basically they've investigated the hot coffee problem and they found out that

976
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:51,020
apparently Take-Two didn't fully reveal the content of the PC versions to the SRB.

977
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:56,420
So what are they doing? Well, they're saying, better not do it again or else we'll fine

978
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:05,140
new yay and they're gonna find them supposedly a civil fine up to $11,000 per violation of course

979
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:12,900
what the violation may be or if it's per title or per copy sold oh none of that was ever said so

980
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,340
i wish i knew more about what take two kind of defended themselves with in this

981
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:22,500
a machete i would have been like listen bitch we didn't fucking put it in the game some person

982
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,680
hacked in there are you that god damn dumb that you can't see this

983
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,260
they're like no big game sack it was on the disc Loki though

984
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,380
it was on the disc just to be a devil's advocate and it was not accessible by

985
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,260
normal means

986
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,060
it was lazy again I go back to it was lazy programming

987
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:44,340
I don't even think it was so much lazy it happens in games all the time they they

988
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,460
meant that they took out the pointer and somebody put it back in with a hack code

989
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,940
it's so dumb it's so dumb that you have to do other stuff

990
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:56,420
in addition to it so it's it's ridiculous in the fact that they're

991
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,860
wasting our money

992
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,180
investigating this I mean for what

993
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,220
oh the proof that this maturity game it's like saying all this already movie

994
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:09,060
said only had blood and violence but I was totally shocked when I saw the

995
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,340
boobies in there too

996
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,100
DJ poo eater over in chat room says what abreast

997
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,220
this is an AO game now but the killing and use of the word nigga is cool

998
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:22,320
exactly is it it's stupid it's just

999
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,260
it's like the whole thing with movies in full-frontal nudity when it comes to

1000
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:26,860
guys

1001
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:31,220
you know it's okay in an r-raid movie but when you get a naked guy in there

1002
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,860
up NC-17 oh my god horrible

1003
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:39,140
it's the same thing with this you know once you add a little nudity in there

1004
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,460
and which you know if you think about actually in the seventies

1005
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,660
it wasn't a big deal at all like you go look at movies or made in the seventies

1006
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,780
like a porky's

1007
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,660
Life of Brian. And Life of Brian. There's wang left and right in those movies, you know?

1008
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,420
But they were just art. What about like God of War where there's

1009
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,820
actual, you know, nudity and that. And they had a sex game and they're granted, they didn't

1010
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:04,180
show anything. But, I mean, if you saw this game and actually played the, you know, Hot

1011
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:08,060
Coffee game or whatever, you would have been, this is ridiculous and stupid. This is like

1012
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:13,580
a sex game. It's about as ridiculous as Custard's Revenge. I mean, it didn't really show anything.

1013
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:19,340
We just showed some stupid, really low-res models dry-humping each other, basically,

1014
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:25,320
and a woman climaxing, I guess, when this meter got up.

1015
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,900
It's ridiculous.

1016
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:34,800
Let's continue moving on, talking about video games and their reputation out there.

1017
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,160
There's a columnist.

1018
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,520
It's John Roseman.

1019
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,360
He's a syndicated Christian columnist.

1020
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,320
He's got 11 books on parenting.

1021
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,800
He believes that collective common sense concerning children has been swamped by tidal waves of

1022
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,800
psychobabble that's lasted some 40 years now.

1023
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,400
He had a column that ran in Monday's edition of the Charlotte Observer.

1024
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,720
Let me give you a quote from it.

1025
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,160
When video games first came out, I warned my readers that they were not appropriate

1026
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
for children.

1027
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,640
I maintained that they were not games, rather.

1028
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,320
They produced stress and were addictive, literally.

1029
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,200
It was not a popular stance, he says, before entering into an I-told-you-so story about

1030
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,040
a mother and father dealing with introducing video games into the lives of their young

1031
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,040
children.

1032
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,240
Here are some other gem quotes from the article here.

1033
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,680
�Since then, hundreds of parents have shared with me their negative experiences with these

1034
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,240
nefarious devices.

1035
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,600
The stories go in my �I told you so� file.

1036
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,480
The following, written by the mother of several young children, is the latest edition.

1037
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,920
When they played, there would be fighting and tears.

1038
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,140
When the parents turned it off, the kids would mope around to complain of having nothing

1039
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,140
to do.

1040
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:43,660
Are these the same children who, pre-XBOX, have never had a problem entertaining themselves?

1041
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,780
Actually, they were not the same children at all.

1042
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:51,240
They were beginning to exhibit addictive behavior, and as anyone who has ever lived with one

1043
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:57,140
will testify, an addict and the former non-addict are two entirely different people.

1044
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,060
The story ends with a warning to all parents.

1045
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:02,980
I firmly believe that video games are dangerous to children and families.

1046
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,980
Do not buy one.

1047
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,700
You cannot control it.

1048
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,700
That's ridiculous.

1049
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:12,140
First off, I love how this guy says, when video games first came out, I warned my readers.

1050
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:16,100
So this guy was writing columns when Space War first came out, Pong, and all that?

1051
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,300
Yeah, so what, in the early 70s, late 60s?

1052
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,100
There were games well before that, too.

1053
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,660
So what about board games, huh?

1054
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,660
Are board games addictive?

1055
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,740
Yeah, or when it rains outside and the children mope around because they can't go outside

1056
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,740
and play football?

1057
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,140
Yeah, that's just how children are.

1058
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,180
give them, like say that you give them a sit and spin, right?

1059
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,860
Right. And then you take it away and the sit and spin was their favorite thing to do.

1060
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,060
Well, how are they going to act? They're going to cry. They're going to be mopey. If you've got

1061
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:48,220
multiple children and you've got a single thing, they're going to fight over it. That's just how

1062
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:53,660
siblings are. If a child's moping around that they have nothing to do, have them do the dishes

1063
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,500
or mop the floor. That's what my mom... Yeah, they can freaking clean the house.

1064
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,420
That's what my mom made me do. Seriously?

1065
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,060
I never was to complain I have nothing to do because if I, my mom always said,

1066
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,780
if you tell me I'm nothing to do I'll find something for you to do. I knew how to do

1067
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,460
laundry when I was six years old.

1068
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:10,060
You know, don't give me this nothing to do crap. You know, you have children to do

1069
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:10,900
your housework for you.

1070
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:15,100
Maybe if you didn't sit your kids in front of the TV and just have the TV raise them

1071
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,940
and then when you take that away then they don't have anything to do.

1072
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,660
Maybe you should teach them, I don't know, to use their imagination or maybe play with

1073
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,140
toys.

1074
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:26,480
My cousin was the same way. You would give him Legos and he wouldn't know what to do with them.

1075
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,100
Because no one taught him how to play by himself or entertain himself. Instead

1076
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:35,020
they would have to entertain him by either putting a

1077
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:38,420
movie on or something like that. He didn't have video games but you know

1078
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:42,860
he liked video games. But it's the same thing it's basically you don't teach your kids

1079
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:43,500
you because

1080
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,860
oh my god you know having the kid and stuff with so much stress and stuff and

1081
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,740
now we don't have time to ourselves and

1082
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,620
oh I'm just so tired with this and now I need something to entertain my

1083
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:58,500
kids and now they won't get along and it's all this video games help because

1084
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
They must have been addicted to it.

1085
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,880
No, they're not addicted to the game.

1086
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,500
They're just kids and they whine because they know whining won't get their way.

1087
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,500
So you know what?

1088
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,720
You just let them whine, let them mope around, but they're going to eventually figure out,

1089
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,720
you know what?

1090
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,720
There's some other things to do.

1091
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
They can go ride a bike.

1092
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,720
They can go outside.

1093
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,720
They can play with their other toys.

1094
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,720
All right.

1095
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:24,860
Well, what I used to do with my little brothers, because my little brothers are about, the

1096
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:31,040
oldest of them is seven years younger than I am I used to when my mom would be

1097
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:35,060
busy I would say I would teach them how to do something and say okay go do this

1098
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:38,820
and when I come back I want to see what you've done you know I would break out

1099
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:42,580
the Lincoln logs I had Lincoln logs when I was a kid I break out the Lincoln logs

1100
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:46,420
I was a tinker toy kid my brother we had tinker toys too my brothers would have

1101
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:49,220
built like a whole fort out of stuff because I showed them how to put them

1102
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:53,540
together we have the large size tinker toys the ones that were like ginormous

1103
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,860
TinkerToy x100. I gotta go to chatroom because they have some great

1104
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,380
comments right now. Legend of Zaku says, Sky, this guy is nothing more than the

1105
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:05,420
advocate of the American Taliban. That's some harsh words but okay, it's your quote

1106
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,140
not mine. Let's see, let's see, and then they start talking about board games

1107
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:12,740
like the chatrooms just going off on board games here. Fireboma says, Monopoly

1108
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:16,160
causes domestic violence. Have you ever seen a family fight over good old

1109
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:22,160
fashioned game of Monopoly? Uh-huh. Let's see, one of my friends favorite stories

1110
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,020
that they always make me tell you know whenever we're doing you whatever is the

1111
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,760
story about my mom and I fighting over the bag of M&Ms I mean you know families

1112
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,080
fight over the dumbest shit they really do let's see let's fight vicious Legend

1113
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:37,840
of Zaku says Frogger's animal cruelty gs-191 think about the children band

1114
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:43,880
connect for let's see Legend of Zaku says mystery date causes premarital sex

1115
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,400
Fireboma says life you know the game of life causes kids to think that having

1116
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,720
having children out of wedlock is okay.

1117
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:58,720
So get this, um, I basically, toys are even more dangerous than video games, I think.

1118
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:06,720
You know, Lincoln Logs, they make great catapults, and you know those, um, what was it, not K'Nex,

1119
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,440
but, um, oh god, I used to make-

1120
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
Tinker Toys?

1121
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,440
No, not Tinker Toys.

1122
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,000
Well, we have the life-size Tinker Toys, and those things were pretty dangerous.

1123
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,080
I remember flicking the little circular knob off of the stick when you pull it back and

1124
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,360
then flick it off the stick and I used to hit my brother in the head with that all the

1125
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,360
time.

1126
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,360
Actually I think it was K'nex.

1127
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:32,200
I made a crossbow out of K'nex, a working crossbow, so if you think that video games

1128
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,920
are dangerous, try dealing with a kid with a crossbow.

1129
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,000
Let's see here, I think this comment is really good too, I wanted to share this so we can

1130
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
move on here.

1131
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,280
Blaze in our chatroom says, I'm a devout Christian and I hate these people who are on a useless

1132
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,280
crusade to try and reform society through their political bullshit.

1133
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,280
Amen.

1134
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,280
That wasn't a pun, by the way.

1135
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,280
I know, I know. We've had these very strange puns come out of nowhere tonight.

1136
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,280
Don't, like, daddy taught daughters to sneak out at night.

1137
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,280
I don't need a game to teach me how to sneak out of the house.

1138
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,280
What did the game Cootie teach us? That's what I want to know.

1139
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,280
How to play with bugs.

1140
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,280
Anyway, let's get into, you know, all this crap going around makes us angsty.

1141
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,820
angsty I don't know about you guys but I get mad when I read all this uninformed

1142
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,060
crap in the media

1143
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:22,140
and the politicians and these guys who writing these articles make them to sell

1144
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,960
more books

1145
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,960
essentially why do you think he who shall not be spoken of on this show

1146
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,720
you know media whore you know does everything he does

1147
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:34,760
his antics. Yeah he he's just trying to sell more copies of his book

1148
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,440
anyway it makes us mad we want to get angsty so that's why we have the

1149
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:42,300
FUs of the week right dark Sakura? Bring on the pain

1150
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:58,780
Well, my F.U. of the week has to do towards something that is built into, not just, particularly

1151
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:05,260
American society, but also for most industrialized developed countries, is how we are taught

1152
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:08,440
to finish everything on our plate when we're children.

1153
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:15,000
I've been doing a lot of research into food and eating, given that I've been looking for

1154
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,720
natural treatments for the chronic fatigue immunodeficiency syndrome, which I try not

1155
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:26,200
to go off on that one, but I've been trying to do a lot of natural research into how to

1156
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:32,680
naturally treat it, and they're basically stating that a lot of the ideals that were

1157
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,680
taught as children by our parents, who of course learn this from their parents, who

1158
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:43,880
from their parents are you know not necessarily the best thing to actually do you know you're

1159
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:49,160
taught to clean your plate no matter how full you are so as you grow up you're taught to overeat

1160
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,600
when you are full you're done not when you're satisfied and i think that a lot of that plus a

1161
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,120
lot of you know a lot of the different you know technology we have now that basically promotes

1162
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,560
being lazy you know a lot of easy food things that are packed full of calories and bad for you

1163
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:10,440
Basically our society is built around a very very vicious relationship with food

1164
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:15,960
And so I personally am trying to go into breaking some of those habits in myself

1165
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,920
But I encourage you know parents when your child says they're full don't make them eat anymore

1166
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,760
Start with them young, you know teach them how to go out and play

1167
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,000
Teach them how to eat, right?

1168
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,240
Don't make them clean their plate because if they're if they're satisfied, there's no need to stuff them

1169
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,960
That's what I have

1170
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,420
look here at you uh... fucking think that

1171
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:38,600
yeah

1172
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,000
you happy guy this week

1173
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,120
i guess uh...

1174
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,760
full conjunctivitis but they've basically said that

1175
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,960
think that but

1176
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,960
it's just it sucks and i've always read

1177
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,020
uh...

1178
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,880
i'm doing it toward you

1179
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,380
uh... no it

1180
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,200
and things

1181
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,080
and i think that uh...

1182
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,720
that's acting

1183
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,200
i'd already doesn't hurt though

1184
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,160
really annoying

1185
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,260
having your high water all day

1186
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,320
uh...

1187
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,520
all right uh... my if you the week goes to my sinus issues or whatever to see

1188
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,320
you've got to see last week's show i was sick i still i feel

1189
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,400
something about the weekends are making me sick lately because i'm sick again

1190
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,560
like i woke up this morning feeling all

1191
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,740
congested and stuff and it sucks i think that go away

1192
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:31,400
i'm not supposed to have allergies and sinus problems

1193
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,880
making me sleep too much. Alright,

1194
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,280
that was our angst for the week. Let's get back into some gaming news and we'll

1195
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,040
go over to DarkSakura. As you know, she likes to

1196
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,880
keep an eye on what's going on overseas and what is going on overseas?

1197
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,440
A bunch of stuff. No, seriously.

1198
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,880
There's actually some UK

1199
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,400
gaming events going on, so I thought that

1200
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,520
it's a good idea for our overseas listeners.

1201
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,260
You know, we like to make sure that they stay in touch, so.

1202
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:11,600
There's the Women in Games UK at the University of Teesside, 10th through 11th in July.

1211
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:13,740

1212
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:18,140
There's the Edinburgh Interactive Entertainment Festival, which is the 21st through 22nd of

1213
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:25,980

There should be more information coming later in June.

1218
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,780
All right.

1219
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,060
And if any of you guys go to this, let us know how it is.

1220
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,060
Sounds good.

1221
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,060
We'd love a write-up.

1222
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,060
All right.

1223
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,340
Let's go over to Loki, who has news.

1224
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:58,440
You know, there's all these tycoons, there's what, Railroad Tycoon, of course, and there

1226
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,080
these games, but this might be one I actually want to check out, Loki, right?

1227
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,900
Yes, they've announced Hell Tycoon, and of course announced it on Tuesday, which was

1228
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,900
June 6th, 2006.

1229
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,900
Are you sure this wasn't a joke?

1230
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,900
Nope.

1231
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:25,660
website is up right now and you can go check it out of course and of course it should be

1232
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:34,280
interesting it's healthhicoon.com obviously and basically you have to manage the misery

1233
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:40,860
of others and make sure that you know make sure I so will play this game I'm going to

1234
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,260
the site right now this site has noise right yes it does okay you might you guys might

1235
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:47,440
hear this come up on the screen, but I have to see this for myself.

1236
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:52,840
It's loading, loading, loading, loading, let's see.

1237
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,440
Oh my gosh.

1238
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,280
Evil noises.

1239
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:00,120
Basically, it says, when Armageddon comes, the demon armies of Hells will be defeated.

1240
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,400
This can only mean one thing. The devil isn't doing his job. You are the new ruler of Hell.

1241
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,760
Your job is to keep Abyss stocked with tortured souls, reform all nine planes of Hell with

1242
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:13,400
fire and brimstone. On judgment day, will you be ready? Of course, it's no secret that

1243
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:20,100
The politicians are controlled by the devil, now you know why Washington DC is built around

1244
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,100
the giant pentagram.

1245
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,840
This scene just goes on and on, that's great.

1246
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,920
It's funny, so go check it out.

1247
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,280
We need to get the makers of Hell Tycoon on this program, I want to talk to them and find

1248
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,280
out what's wrong with them, I mean seriously, how messed up do you have to be to think of

1249
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,280
something like this?

1250
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,280
That's awesome.

1251
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:43,080
That actually sounds kind of smart, I'm going to check this out I think when it comes out.

1252
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:49,300
Let's see we have dark Tetsuya says sounds like Loki's kind of game actually Bob Dole says that sounds awesome

1253
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,240
Hitstun wants to know does anybody own the tycoon name?

1254
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,800
I guess not because you see all these tycoon games like all the time and

1255
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:04,740
Jeremy Todd one made the mandatory joke I suppose beating this joke into the ground giant enemy crab cartoon or tycoon

1256
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:09,220
Journey Tycoon, where you manage the band Journey.

1257
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:19,620
Speaking of a joke that never gets old, Uwe Boll has sued the distributor of Blood Rain.

1258
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,820
Basically there was this old debacle that happened with the movie.

1259
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:27,500
It was supposed to open on all these screens, it didn't even really end up happening.

1260
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:32,460
Boll basically alleges that Romare, the studio that made this, breached his contract with

1261
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:37,260
the director by failing to release the film on 2,000 screens, refusing to pay the producers

1262
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:41,420
their share of the gross proceeds, and not using the $10 million that Bull's production

1263
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:45,860
company had given them for promotion and advertising of the film.

1264
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:50,260
This suit has been confirmed that it is going on there, but who knows what will actually

1265
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,260
happen with that.

1266
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,500
Let's see, I'm trying to look for a comment here.

1267
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,860
He did comment, and basically, yeah, it was all bullshit.

1268
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:02,000
Let's see, Romare Entertainment co-founder James Schramm had a comment here.

1269
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,880
He had such bad publicity that I felt bad and I wanted to help him out.

1270
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,800
We made no money on this movie, nothing.

1271
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,800
We lost.

1272
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,800
This is a complete financial loss and he has the audacity to remove us off the credits.

1273
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,800
Yeah, that was the thing.

1274
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:19,000
They removed, when the DVD came out, they removed them off the credits for that and

1275
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,260
they made it look like that.

1276
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:25,640
It was produced by or distributed by Uwe Boll instead of Romare.

1277
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,720
So yeah, he's a jackass.

1278
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,400
I wouldn't have known because there's no way I'm going to watch that DVD.

1279
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,840
Alright, anyway, we're going to go ahead and take a break and when we come back there'll

1280
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,720
be plenty more Orange Lounge Radio where this came from, so we'll see you in a little bit.

1281
