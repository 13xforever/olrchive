00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:19,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, June 11th, 2006, Xbox gets updates and is the luminous release around the corner.

2
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:26,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Video game addicts get their own version of the Betty Ford Clinic, and a game of Solitaire comes into play during the high-profile trial.

3
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:36,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:39,610
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here to talk about all the news that gamers really want to know about.

5
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:41,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here to help you through that.

6
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,753
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:43,754
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:48,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:49,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Water.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandwich.

11
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think I might start referring to her as the queen of the internet.

12
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:55,765
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the queen of the internet.

13
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:56,986
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the goddess of the internet.

14
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:57,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,462 --> 00:00:58,982
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

16
00:00:59,162 --> 00:00:59,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Bow down.

17
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:00,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch that ego there.

18
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:01,043
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

19
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:01,803
[SPEAKER_02]: What ego?

20
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:02,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

21
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:03,864
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only explosive.

22
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:04,444
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Over there, say hello to the other queen of the internet, Loki.

24
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:09,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a queen.

25
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:09,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not.

26
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:13,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be Rob, the queen of the internet.

27
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:16,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, how are you doing, Loki, Tech Master Loki?

28
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:17,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing okay.

29
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:17,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

30
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:18,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to start off the show by issuing any apologies this week?

32
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:22,451
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

33
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:23,335
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure?

34
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:23,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

35
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:27,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know we got a large sharpened emails this week.

36
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because I... Because Loki misstated, misrepresented some facts last week.

37
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I made a mistake.

38
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:33,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, they caught him!

39
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:33,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

40
00:01:34,264 --> 00:01:34,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

41
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:40,689
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I already sent emails to said people, so I have nothing more to say.

42
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:41,369
[SPEAKER_03]: You sure?

43
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:47,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't notice the optical audio out on every single cable that I own for the Xbox 360.

44
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:49,535
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

45
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:50,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

46
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:51,457
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

47
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:52,698
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only mistake I made, though.

48
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:55,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever, ever.

49
00:01:56,608 --> 00:02:01,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I somehow doubt that, but we know that when Loki makes mistakes, the Mac fans will be there to catch him.

50
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:02,233
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always good.

51
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:03,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it wasn't about Macs.

52
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:09,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it wasn't about Macs, but they're the ones that are looking to, you know, get you the best they can.

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I noticed that, well, there was a story this week too, but maybe we'll get into that later.

54
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:15,785
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see.

55
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:20,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's start off the show as we always start off the show, talking about our gaming weeks.

56
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:21,939
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, start us off.

57
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:22,619
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

58
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DarkSakura has a mouthful of sandwich.

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with Loki, then.

60
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:26,421
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

61
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

62
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:35,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing, what was it, Joel Quest for some reason, because the achievements are easy.

63
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:41,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I don't know, the game was really easy until the last few levels, and then it gets really frustrating.

64
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,092
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really kind of...

65
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:48,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, balance out the difficulty over the course of the game.

66
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:53,429
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be getting, you know, increasingly harder as it goes along, not just easy, easy, easy, hard, you know.

67
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't think they did that very well.

68
00:02:56,692 --> 00:03:09,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really a crapshoot whether it's easy or not because, like, the level I just played a few minutes ago, you know, I played about four times before and I couldn't pass it because it was just impossible to get the blocks in the right positions.

69
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:13,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, you know, I started up and boom, it's super easy.

70
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished it, like, in no time.

71
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Luck plays a huge role in the game.

72
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:42,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

73
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:48,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe sign back on or something, because sometimes if the game doesn't pick up your achievement right away, when you sign back on, it'll give it to you.

74
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:49,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened to me in Uno.

75
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:56,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I was missing two achievements I should have had, and I went back in the game later, and it gave them to me, just right off the bat, pretty much.

76
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

77
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

78
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But then what else was I playing?

79
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:06,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other game, I think it was Never Ending Warning or something.

80
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:07,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like some...

81
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:09,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow of the Colossus

82
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:33,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a PC game.

83
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:34,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It was for Neverending Story 2.

84
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:37,950
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't count.

85
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,830
[SPEAKER_02]: No wonder it was bad.

86
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,191
[SPEAKER_00]: That movie had The Flash in it.

87
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,632
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who played The Flash on TV.

88
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:47,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to make a game based off the original.

89
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:50,993
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

90
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:19,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Played a little bit of New Super Mario Bros., but I'm really sick of that game.

91
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:20,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really sick of it.

92
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:23,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And... I don't know.

93
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:27,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you supposed to be able to unlock some mini-games?

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've played it through most of the games so far, and nothing's unlocked.

95
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:34,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the same ones that used to be on the Mario 64.

96
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:37,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you do unlock others, but I haven't played it quite enough.

97
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:38,863
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some hidden secrets.

98
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:41,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, have you gotten to the two completely hidden worlds, 4 and 7, yet?

99
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

100
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:44,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are easy to get to, but...

101
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but you might miss them if you don't look for them.

102
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:50,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all the way through 7.

103
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:55,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played through, I've unlocked all those, but I haven't unlocked any of the minigames.

104
00:05:56,694 --> 00:06:04,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they're just multiplayer exclusive minigames that are brand new to this, but I haven't seen anything new unlocked.

105
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:05,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Ion671 seems to agree with you New Super Mario Bros.

106
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:06,316
[SPEAKER_02]: gets old fast

107
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a re-release of The Guardian Legend.

108
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:44,821
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

109
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,703
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

110
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:52,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we have this discussion a while back that somebody owns the rights to that that's never going to make it a new version?

111
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:54,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Broderbund went under.

112
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all on Wikipedia.

113
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to Wikipedia.

114
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:56,771
[SPEAKER_02]: All the answers are there.

115
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:57,712
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I remember.

116
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to actually get an MSX.

117
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:06,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I play Blazing Angels multiplayer, which is fun.

118
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogfighting during lunch.

119
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:13,625
[SPEAKER_03]: The game, though, the only thing that's really disappointing about that game is that you can't crash the planes into each other.

120
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,291
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

121
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

122
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:03,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say, thankfully, that game's not $60, and it's getting some price cuts to a more reasonable amount, so that's cool.

123
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think, though, that Burnout Revenge has a really well-done multiplayer mode.

124
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I think multiplayer's a lot of fun to play.

125
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:23,404
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it kind of set up, and when you're crashing into people and doing the takedowns, it kind of shows you who your enemies are before the match, and it's all kind of like a movie, the way it presents everything.

126
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:26,145
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of gives you this running commentary on the top of the screen,

127
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:27,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So and so has just crashed.

128
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:29,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So and so took down so and so.

129
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of neat the way it's all presented.

130
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:35,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't you hate though when you're playing the game and the camera switches and then you crash into something?

131
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the camera switched, yeah.

132
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:38,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a little bit annoying.

133
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:44,441
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't get that so much in multiplayer because it can't really stop time as much in multiplayer because everybody's racing at the same time so you don't really get that.

134
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Otherwise, pretty much more of the same.

135
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been playing new Super Mario Bros.

136
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:50,711
[SPEAKER_02]: DS.

137
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not quite sick of that yet.

138
00:08:52,292 --> 00:09:00,536
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, somebody in chatroom there says, uh... Uh... Ion671 says the new Super Mario games are multi.

139
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:03,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where you unlock those, is they're the multiplayer games.

140
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:06,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the multiplayer games are a hell of a lot of fun in there.

141
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,639
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta play them at least once.

142
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,540
[SPEAKER_02]: For multiplayer DS games, they're a lot of fun.

143
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So you gotta try it at least once before you knock it.

144
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:13,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

145
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:17,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you know, I'm still on jury duty.

146
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,550
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were listening to last week's show, I've been on a jury.

147
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still can't talk about the trial, guys.

148
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:21,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

149
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:26,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's supposed to be done early next week, so maybe I can talk about it next Sunday.

150
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:31,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But meanwhile, during the downtime, I've been playing Final Fantasy I still.

151
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good game to play at the courthouse.

152
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeps me busy when there's a lot, a lot of downtime.

153
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:38,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much it.

154
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:42,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I did buy off the Xbox Live Arcade WIC Fable of Souls just because...

155
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:47,080
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't released anything on Xbox Live Arcade in forever, so I decided to buy something I didn't have yet.

156
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the concept.

157
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:51,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems kind of neat so far.

158
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:52,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty lame, isn't it?

159
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:53,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

160
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:56,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was as bad as you said it was in the beginning.

161
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like I'll have fun with it for a little while.

162
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:01,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely a $5, $10 title.

163
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:04,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's $10, and I couldn't see paying much more for it.

164
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,312
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely the type of thing, like a Flash game.

165
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's cute.

166
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll entertain me for a little while.

167
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

168
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:18,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually didn't really play much of anything this week.

169
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:24,069
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've had a whole week where I've had the time off, and I haven't really felt like playing anything.

170
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:31,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a mini vacation from games this week, except that I actually moved a bunch of our game stuff around.

171
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:33,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of game stuff at my house.

172
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:35,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we almost got rid of our Virtual Boy.

173
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you do that?

174
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:40,343
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to trade it for help on a pinball machine.

175
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say we got another pinball machine?

176
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:43,446
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.

177
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had some games this week.

178
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:48,810
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a Last Action Hero pinball machine.

179
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:54,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Which actually has romantic significance for me and Dan.

180
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:59,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I used to work at GNC back in the day... Bit of a big shock, me working at GNC.

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,344
[SPEAKER_00]: When we used to take the deposit, the deposit box was right next to, at the time, a Godfather's Pizza store.

182
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan's getting our DS lights today.

183
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

184
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally forgot.

185
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:33,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Until I came into chat room this evening and somebody was talking about it, I forgot that DS Lights had been released today.

186
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:35,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh yeah, I was going to get one of those.

187
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,410
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm holding off this time.

188
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is not going to get my money until the new colors come out that I want.

189
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually want a white one.

190
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:42,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?

191
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:43,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

192
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:43,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wait.

193
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:46,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hold off for something like maybe green, purple, hot pink.

194
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:47,132
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

195
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,282
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

196
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have some stories coming up in the second half of the show.

197
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,550
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll talk about functionality between the Wii and the DS, so it'll be kind of interesting to see if they start marketing the two systems together.

198
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

199
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:20,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Wii.

200
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:20,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Wii.

201
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:25,052
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did a little bit of drawing.

202
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:32,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some Kingdom Hearts-related drawing over the week, but other than that, my week's been pretty.

203
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot I played one more game.

204
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I played DDR this week.

205
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:36,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

206
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:36,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I played

207
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:39,647
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Golf Land.

208
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:46,229
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to go play Miniature Golf, but then we found out that they're closing early because of the grad night thing.

209
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,472
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted me to play DDR, but there's people playing the DDR machines except for Disney's Rave, which wasn't being played.

210
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:56,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to play Disney's Rave, and I have no stamina anymore.

211
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:05,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I accidentally picked Twilight Zone on doubles, which is a 10, and that's not fun, especially when you're out of shape.

212
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:09,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how many more pounds do you weigh now than when you played DDR religiously?

213
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:09,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't remember.

214
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:11,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, good escape.

215
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,569
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we went and played QZAR instead, though.

216
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:15,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard.

217
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Extraverse say you guys had gone to QZAR.

218
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:18,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

219
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat the crap out of everyone like I normally do.

220
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:21,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Loser.

221
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:23,413
[SPEAKER_02]: How many games of QZAR have you played in your life?

222
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:25,472
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

223
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Neo Geo, Puzzle Bobble

224
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I will go ahead and start us off tonight.

225
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:39,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Xbox 360 got some updates finally this week, as you guys may have noticed.

226
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:44,186
[SPEAKER_02]: They released it on 6.6.6, which was a great day for 360 to get some new upgrades.

227
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:48,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, when you power on your Xbox and connect to Xbox Live, you'll have to download the update.

228
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take very long at all.

229
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:55,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can download up to six movies, demos, whatever, at a time.

230
00:14:56,151 --> 00:15:00,473
[SPEAKER_02]: They've kind of re-laid out the store a little bit so that you can find stuff quicker.

231
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,494
[SPEAKER_02]: They have more categories, and I think they have some...

232
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:11,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think they need to just reorganize the store completely like the way it's presented, but at least they made improvements to the setup they've got, so I guess I can't complain too much.

233
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:15,523
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I noticed right off the bat was custom soundtracks.

234
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:24,069
[SPEAKER_02]: They made a whole lot better because I use custom soundtracks quite a bit in Uno, which has some really god-awful music, and even in Burnout.

235
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:24,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to listen to the...

236
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,690
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

237
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:54,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed Xbox Live Arcade games load a lot faster because what it does is when it's scanning your drive for arcade games, it only does that once.

238
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it used to do it twice.

239
00:15:56,181 --> 00:16:01,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It would do it once on the main menu and then when you went in to actually select a game, you'd watch all your games fill in again.

240
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:02,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it kind of bypasses that.

241
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:04,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of nice.

242
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:09,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get to your games a little faster, especially when you have like 17 games like I do in the Xbox Live Arcade.

243
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:09,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of nice.

244
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:20,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you want to see the full list of upgrades, because there's a whole bunch, DVD player and all that stuff, head on over to Xbox.com and it's in their recent news.

245
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And I downloaded it and I put this thing to the test, not just with the custom soundtracks.

246
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:27,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded three trailers all at once and it worked great.

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I even made them, I powered off my machine while one was downloading and then I thought, oh crap, that probably was not a smart idea because you're not supposed to

248
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn your machines off while it's riding to the hard drive, but I just kind of forgot it was going.

249
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:39,990
[SPEAKER_02]: But I turned it back on and nothing was wrong.

250
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It picked right back up and started going again.

251
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:52,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't recommend you guys do this because you might hurt something, but it's nice to know that it's not going to kill your Xbox to turn off the power once or twice while it's downloading.

252
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the updates.

253
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, did you get a chance to check out the updates at all on your Xbox?

254
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had the update anyways, but no.

255
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:01,584
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

256
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:08,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really use custom soundtracks just because I haven't loaded anything on there yet.

257
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to burnout anyways, I just normally forward to today.

258
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:16,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's like 40 some tracks in there of all crap.

259
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there is a way.

260
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,500
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually sort what plays when.

261
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:26,526
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do is I stream over the Wi-Fi.

262
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,848
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I get the custom soundtracks.

263
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:32,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I stream my MP3 collection from the computer using the MediaConnect thing.

264
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:34,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I stream that over the Wi-Fi and it works great.

265
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:38,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You can set up playlists in Winamp and Xbox 360 will read those.

266
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:39,382
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

267
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:04,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I will.

268
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:06,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what's coming out on the Xbox 360?

269
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:08,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 2 eventually, I hope?

270
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:09,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris!

271
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:10,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well that's cool.

272
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:17,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, apparently THQ could get things settled and now we've got Tetris on the 360.

273
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:28,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a lawsuit last year against the Tetris company saying that they had breached a contract about releasing the DS version.

274
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,292
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're getting it on the 360.

275
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:31,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

276
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:34,013
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have it on 360 in Japan.

277
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,775
[SPEAKER_00]: But not in US and Europe.

278
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,896
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out actually both in US and Europe.

279
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:44,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Why isn't it supposed to be coming out like... I mean, I couldn't imagine that there's too much to localize with Tetris.

280
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:52,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not so much a localization thing as a Nintendo has a Tetris game out right now, so I think there's licensing dispute-y things that have been going on behind the scenes.

281
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,646
[SPEAKER_00]: But they released it first party.

282
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So they couldn't say anything.

283
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's good.

284
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't touched the Japanese version.

285
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope...

286
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:03,112
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

287
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:32,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so, so stupid.

288
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:36,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

289
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you have some more news on Xbox.

290
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:56,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the creator of such wonderful games like Dead Rising and Lost Planet, Keiji Inafune, basically has come out saying, you know, the Xbox right now, they're up to about 60% of

291
00:19:58,393 --> 00:19:58,573
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

292
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:23,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

293
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:27,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, his comment was, the more years you study a platform, the better you get.

294
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Some games you'll see in three to four years will be truly amazing.

295
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:36,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, pretty much you can say the same thing about the PlayStation 3.

296
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:39,525
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, that goes with all game systems out there.

297
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:45,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, this wasn't huge news, because usually when game systems first come out, they aren't exactly reaching their full potential.

298
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:50,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then you get lazy companies that just want to port crap over, you know, like EA.

299
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say EA is the only one, Activision.

300
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

301
00:20:59,290 --> 00:20:59,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

302
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:04,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to put out for the record, I looked up Jellico on Wikipedia and they are still in business.

303
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,914
[SPEAKER_02]: But their English website has nothing on it.

304
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:08,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a picture and a placeholder.

305
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think they're making a lot, but they're still around.

306
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,778
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably more of a developer now.

307
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have made them.

308
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:17,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going off memory, guys.

309
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure they were the ones that had made that.

310
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,362
[SPEAKER_02]: See, now I need to look that up too.

311
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

312
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:25,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Rising is awesome.

313
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:26,048
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

314
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:26,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris Plus.

315
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:27,748
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is right there.

316
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:31,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising is going to be fucking great.

317
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:38,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Lost Planet, I wish it was coming out sooner, but it's supposed to be coming out, I think, January.

318
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,190
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be amazing.

319
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,271
[SPEAKER_03]: The demo is really cool.

320
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:46,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really my kind of game, but I can see where people are really into it.

321
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked pretty good.

322
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:49,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumble Roses Double X

323
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: A demo is now up on Xbox Live, as well as brand new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.

324
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:29,615
[SPEAKER_02]: These were things that were supposed to come out sooner, and there was even an announcement that went out that they'd gone out, but then they got pulled.

325
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:33,616
[SPEAKER_02]: They're now out there on Xbox Live Marketplace.

326
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:34,216
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there now.

327
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:38,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Plaza Trench Rooftops and Gas Plant for 500 points.

328
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:39,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 625.

329
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that interests you, check that out on Xbox Live.

330
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:48,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect Dark Zero just couldn't really get into that game either.

331
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:48,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

332
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:51,807
[SPEAKER_02]: All the maps in the world won't make that a better game.

333
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:56,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of one of those games I'll go back to maybe in a few months and try it again, see if maybe I can kind of get it.

334
00:22:57,268 --> 00:23:00,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as first-person shooters go, I play so few of them anyway.

335
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Halo is cool, and Quake 3, but not Quake 4.

336
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:06,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

337
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:07,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wasn't feeling Perfect Dark Zero.

338
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:08,953
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the age now.

339
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:09,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 2006.

340
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:10,693
[SPEAKER_03]: We're approaching 2007.

341
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:16,605
[SPEAKER_03]: and yet companies can't grasp jump technology.

342
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:20,846
[SPEAKER_03]: The ability to jump in games is very important because we have feet.

343
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,827
[SPEAKER_03]: They do other things other than walk and run.

344
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:23,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They can jump.

345
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:27,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that should have been in Perfect Dark.

346
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you have some more news about Xbox Live.

347
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:40,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, there's a whole bunch of releases that were supposedly leaked out there from a magazine.

348
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:47,899
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those, of course, being Street Fighter 2, which is supposed to be coming out in July, we hope.

349
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:48,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe it anymore.

350
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:49,820
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I thought it was June.

351
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,800
[SPEAKER_02]: June, July.

352
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe it anymore, anyway.

353
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:53,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

354
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:53,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

355
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:56,243
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been so many release dates for that game.

356
00:23:57,084 --> 00:23:58,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be out whenever they're ready.

357
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

358
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:00,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick of speculating on dates.

359
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:10,711
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying June, but then again, this is from a magazine, and if we've come to learn anything from magazines, they're printed way the hell in advance, and

360
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:12,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Luminous Live $1200

361
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:39,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

362
00:24:56,164 --> 00:25:04,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be 200, 300, 100 points to download Madonna, you know, whatever else they're planning on putting in there from other artists.

363
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:06,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Those high-name artists will probably cost a little money.

364
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:11,148
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's profit to be made, Luminous will cost even more money.

365
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:16,209
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the game on the PSP costs $19.99, so, you know.

366
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:19,070
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course, on that one you have the perk of you have it on the go.

367
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the other ones that were confirmed, though, and this is actually confirmed with Namco...

368
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man is going to be out sometime in August or September for 400 Microsoft points or 5 bucks.

369
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, supposedly coming around the same time, I believe, was Frogger.

370
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:39,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposed to be coming out from Konami.

371
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:40,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Also about the same price.

372
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:43,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was another Namco game, too.

373
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

374
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:46,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Pac-Man or Galaxian?

375
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:49,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Galaxian was the other one, yeah.

376
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, some other ones that they mentioned...

377
00:25:52,523 --> 00:26:00,088
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cameo Hardcore Package featuring more difficult versions of the single-player campaign and co-op campaigns.

378
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:08,174
[SPEAKER_03]: More skins and new leaderboards, plus some more co-op competitive elements.

379
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:12,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's supposed to be coming out in July for 500 Microsoft points, or 625.

380
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:17,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Cloning Clyde, also in July for 800 Microsoft points, or 10 bucks.

381
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And Robo Blitz, sometime in August or September.

382
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,120
[SPEAKER_03]: for 800 Microsoft Points or $10.

383
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:33,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they need some games to come out in June because there's only one Xbox 360... No, two now because one moved to June again.

384
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:34,426
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

385
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:36,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Over G Fighters.

386
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:41,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Over G Fighters and MotoGP 2006 are the only ones coming out in June right now.

387
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:45,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Comments from our chat room over at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.

388
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:46,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat.

389
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:51,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale says, If anything, Microsoft should give us $6.25 for making us play Perfect Dark.

390
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:58,102
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN says Sky Rare refuses to use jump features in their first person shooters.

391
00:26:59,303 --> 00:26:59,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

392
00:27:00,524 --> 00:27:01,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder where that comes from.

393
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:06,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway, going over to DarkSakura who has some more news for us.

394
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:08,993
[SPEAKER_02]: This one also relating to Xbox.

395
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:09,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a...

396
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:18,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumor out from an introversion that Darwinia is going to be available on Xbox Live Arcade.

397
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:29,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, some of the support for this is that basically there's other versions of Darwinia out.

398
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:35,739
[SPEAKER_00]: They said there's been talk actually from Microsoft, I think, that they've been really wanting to use it.

399
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:41,543
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of just talk going around that says it's really going to happen.

400
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,946
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I've heard a lot of good about Darwinia.

401
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:50,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really popular indie title, and I know we've gotten emails on it even before, and I've heard a discussion about the game on other shows.

402
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:52,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our listeners overseas.

403
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:56,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that would be really cool if that does hit Xbox Live.

404
00:27:56,913 --> 00:28:00,174
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge exposure for it, and it's a good marriage.

405
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:08,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox Live Arcade is supposed to be set up to help out the indie developers, so I hope it works out for them and give it some easy achievements for the achievement points horse.

406
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:17,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, for those that like to do things to their Xbox 360s that could void the warranty, there's some news.

407
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.

408
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Modchip's coming out, finally.

409
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:28,460
[SPEAKER_03]: This website, devil360.com, actually they were trying to release it on 666, but weren't done in time.

410
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:38,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're actually trying to improve it right now to try to protect it from any type of updates, make it programmable via PC, and able to boot unsigned code.

411
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:47,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll allow you to swap the hard drive with a larger drive using a special interface between the 360 and the hard drive, and a lot more.

412
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:55,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically they're saying that it's going to be due out probably sometime by the end of this year.

413
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:58,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're still working on it right now.

414
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's coming soon.

415
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:02,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming soon.

416
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:05,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Won't Microsoft just put out a patch?

417
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:18,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be something that they might not be able to patch because they may be able to... I mean, if you think about it, okay, Xbox, the original Xbox...

418
00:29:19,397 --> 00:29:20,337
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

419
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:51,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, don't forget, you can hook in a keyboard into your Xbox 360, kind of like Final Fantasy XI on the Xbox 360.

420
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:55,449
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play it with a controller, but I really wouldn't recommend it.

421
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, okay, I take that back.

422
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:07,773
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the controller if you have really good macros set up, but even to put in the macros, you really need a keyboard to do all that and to chat with people, I mean, if you ever want to chat.

423
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:14,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can get away with most of the basic elements using, you know, good macros with a controller, but you really need a keyboard for that game.

424
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,181
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

425
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:43,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined some server extifers on.

426
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:48,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about get the characters to level 19 and do nothing but battlegrounds is what they're wanting to do.

427
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:50,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Him and some other friends.

428
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have my server with me too?

429
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:55,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do one that's all the way to level 60 if I stick with the game that long.

430
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:56,187
[SPEAKER_02]: What server are you on?

431
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:59,908
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Scarlet Crusade for my alliance and Bronzebeard for my horde.

432
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:01,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we'll see.

433
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on Elder Thalys is the one I'm working with the level 19 on.

434
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I might make one on there.

435
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,551
[SPEAKER_00]: My characters are still noob level.

436
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:09,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

437
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:11,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

438
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:12,616
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

439
00:31:13,316 --> 00:31:14,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to the Nintendo Wii.

440
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:20,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Buy has listed Nintendo Wii games for pre-order.

441
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:23,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I'm checking the link right now to see if they're actually still up.

442
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sure enough, they are.

443
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows Red Steel, Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Smash Bros.

444
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl all coming out December 1st, 2006.

445
00:31:31,862 --> 00:31:35,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you believe those release dates... You're an idiot.

446
00:31:36,043 --> 00:31:36,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um...

447
00:31:37,575 --> 00:31:47,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously those release dates are just in the system to try and get pre-orders moving, you know, amongst some of those really hotly talked about games such as Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros.

448
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:47,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl.

449
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:56,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know why this is news, but just for those people that think these are actual release dates and this points to, oh, the Wii's coming out December 1st.

450
00:31:56,702 --> 00:32:01,604
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the Wii will be out before the day before Thanksgiving, or the day after Thanksgiving.

451
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:03,285
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

452
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:38,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be surprised if the PS3 launches on the date that they said it will.

453
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:41,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't launch until next year.

454
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:49,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say they can't pull it off and it could be a really great system with lots of cool games.

455
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going to be working some massive overtime over it.

456
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:56,523
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to seriously need the help of some leprechauns to make this thing happen.

457
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,020
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see.

458
00:32:59,661 --> 00:32:59,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

459
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't count Sony out yet.

460
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:03,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So what if they kind of lost E3, so to speak, you know?

461
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:04,764
[SPEAKER_02]: They could come back.

462
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:07,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sony fanboys know that in the back of their mind.

463
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:14,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best interest of Sony right now is to get all of their upper people to stop saying stupid shit.

464
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,231
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they need to do.

465
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:16,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually...

466
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Sony could benefit from a gag order.

467
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:21,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like Nintendo has, kind of, sort of.

468
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo doesn't really, but Nintendo they don't let out a lot of secrets.

469
00:33:26,192 --> 00:33:28,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Or when they do let out secrets, it's very carefully timed.

470
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:29,994
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they do it.

471
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:31,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

472
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:33,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

473
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:36,257
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because Nintendo hires smart people.

474
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:40,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on to some release dates that we do know about.

475
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,082
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you like to travel the globe and tell our buddies in Europe what they have to look forward to.

476
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:47,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some

477
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:51,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not very exciting things unless you're a PC gamer, I guess.

478
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Copa Inata is coming out on PC.

479
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:59,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Ship Simulator 2006 is coming out on the 15th.

480
00:33:59,302 --> 00:34:00,662
[SPEAKER_00]: The first game was out on the 13th.

481
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:04,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And then coming up on the 16th is Glory of the Roman Empire.

482
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:13,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on the 16th for DS we have Miss Spider, Harvest Time, Hop and Fly, and The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle Earth 2 on Xbox 360 on the 16th.

483
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:13,625
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

484
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:21,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving over stateside, Loki, you know any good releases for the US coming up?

485
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:28,651
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually some pretty cool stuff, and one of them that I'm definitely getting this week, Point Blank for the DS is coming out, finally.

486
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:40,196
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Game Boy Advance, if you're a fan of the Mega Man Battle Network games, Mega Man Battle Network 6, Falzar, and Gregar are going to be both coming out.

487
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, coming out on PC, we've got Darwinia.

488
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:45,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

489
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:55,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimate Quake, Rush for Berlin, Rise and Fall of Civilizations at War, Deep Sea Tycoon, a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff.

490
00:34:57,374 --> 00:35:07,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on PlayStation 2, of course, Armored Core Last Raven, Street Fighter Alpha Anthology, and Urban Chaos Riot Response, which is also coming out on Xbox.

491
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:11,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the PSP, you've got the Metal Gear Solid Digital Collection,

492
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:12,943
[SPEAKER_03]: and 360 MotoGP 2006

493
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:27,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, we were talking about the PlayStation 3 a little bit ago, and of course one game a lot of folks are looking forward to on the PlayStation 3 is Metal Gear Solid 4.

494
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:31,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some new details about Metal Gear Solid 4 announced in a very recent interview.

495
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:35,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Hideo Kojima said that there's a new camo suit that Snake's going to have.

496
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:37,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the OctoCam.

497
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:42,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this will do is it will change shape and color to match the surroundings that Snake has.

498
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:46,660
[SPEAKER_02]: These chameleon effects are going to happen automatically whenever Snake is resting.

499
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds kind of interesting.

500
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the trailer.

501
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:52,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be a graphically impressive sort of event, so we'll see.

502
00:35:52,742 --> 00:36:01,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kojima's dropping little hints left and right about Metal Gear Solid 4, just enough to remind the fans it's coming out and they better be supporting PlayStation 3, like it or not.

503
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:09,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, here's another game that as the release date gets pushed back and pushed back, it's harder and harder to support, but the fans love it.

504
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:11,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

505
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:13,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically...

506
00:36:14,912 --> 00:36:19,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Take Two has said that Duke Nukem Forever will be out by December 31st.

507
00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:23,415
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bold statement.

508
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:24,435
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean it this time?

509
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:25,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really mean it this time?

510
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've got an incentive now.

511
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:34,939
[SPEAKER_03]: As it was, they're not giving the full funding for the game.

512
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:37,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe originally it was $6 million.

513
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:37,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're down to $4.25 million.

514
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a $500,000 incentive

515
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

516
00:37:01,946 --> 00:37:04,408
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mighty breath to hold right there.

517
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:06,570
[SPEAKER_02]: This game better kick ass.

518
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

519
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:18,121
[SPEAKER_02]: With all this anticipation and all this waiting that's gone into it, this game better kick some ass so we can all eat our words and we've been bashing all these delays.

520
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:18,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It better be worth it.

521
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:21,524
[SPEAKER_02]: This game will have to be better than sex.

522
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:24,026
[SPEAKER_03]: This game will have to do my laundry.

523
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

524
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:28,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether or not it'll come out,

525
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone cares at this point.

526
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

527
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:33,456
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

528
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:36,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem 3D, a lot of love for that game.

529
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:40,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Even 10 years later after the game was released, still a lot of love for that game.

530
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people out there that will support it.

531
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:45,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on the goddamn Xbox Live Arcade.

532
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:47,284
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Duke Nukem 3D?

533
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:47,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

534
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:49,365
[SPEAKER_02]: That would actually be pretty sweet.

535
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,886
[SPEAKER_02]: You think realistically that would ever happen?

536
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:52,467
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

537
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:52,667
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

538
00:37:53,223 --> 00:37:53,843
[SPEAKER_03]: But it could.

539
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:55,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the game's small enough.

540
00:37:56,064 --> 00:38:02,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, I would imagine that the Xbox 360 would have the power to, I don't know, play that game.

541
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,766
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think it could be cool.

542
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:08,347
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have done the same thing with Quake 2 instead of releasing it with Quake 4.

543
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:10,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that could have been pretty cool.

544
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:14,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

545
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:19,310
[SPEAKER_02]: In reference to a topic we were talking about earlier, JeremyTodd1 says, Duke Nukem is the never-starting story.

546
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:20,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

547
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we had never-ending story, right?

548
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:22,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

549
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:22,311
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

550
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everybody's talking about vaporware, so to speak.

551
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:30,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireboma says, hey guys, let's go play on our Phantoms.

552
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:32,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Phantoms are coming out.

553
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:34,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but so is Duke Nukem Forever.

554
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:40,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but I'm saying that they've, I mean, even though they've kept pushing back the date, they actually did have a date set for release.

555
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:44,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and yeah, sure, they'll hit that, you know.

556
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

557
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they will and we can all... I say at the end of the year it goes and it hasn't released at that point, I'll consider it vaporware.

558
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:50,264
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

559
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:54,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm actually going to care about getting one, but, you know.

560
00:38:54,909 --> 00:39:00,213
[SPEAKER_02]: QuickSilver over in our chatroom is saying, I want Mortal Kombat on Xbox Live Arcade.

561
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,434
[SPEAKER_02]: They are coming out with Mortal Kombat 3.

562
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:06,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either Mortal Kombat 3 or Ultimate Mortal Kombat or one of those.

563
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:09,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't they put out the only good one they had, which was Mortal Kombat 2?

564
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:12,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

565
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe because, well, see... Mortal Kombat 3 was like when the series started to go crappy.

566
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:30,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Mortal Kombat 2 is available on the Midway packs or whatever, but then again, so is Mortal Kombat 3, but I don't think, I could be wrong, but I don't think Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was available in those Midway treasures or whatever it was called.

567
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, you couldn't play them online either, which is a huge...

568
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:39,835
[SPEAKER_02]: All it is is that because Street Fighter is coming out, Mortal Kombat has to come out.

569
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:43,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the greatest video game competitions ever.

570
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat.

571
00:39:45,957 --> 00:39:47,618
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what we need is a new Killer Instinct.

572
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:49,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

573
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:50,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but that would make me so happy.

574
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:51,999
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make me happy too.

575
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a Killer Instinct fangirl.

576
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:54,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

577
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they'd take out the jump feature in that one too.

578
00:40:00,757 --> 00:40:06,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to go over to our mailbag over at mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is our email address.

579
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:09,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura likes to dig through the mailbag.

580
00:40:09,764 --> 00:40:15,649
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to put on her hazmat suit and pull out some emails and share them with us so we can taunt your emails live on air.

581
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:16,950
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kidding.

582
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We love getting mail of all types.

583
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:24,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the hate mail we got this week thanks to Loki's uninformed statement on Xbox Sound Support last week.

584
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:24,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Loki.

585
00:40:24,837 --> 00:40:25,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever.

586
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:27,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag?

587
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:40,188
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one comes from Kurt, one of our listeners It's like, hey I was wondering if you guys could fill me in on the rules that Sony may have regarding how many PS3s each person will be allowed to buy Or is there only one per household allowed?

588
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:44,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Will people be selling the PS3 on eBay for megabucks like the PS2 and the Xbox 360?

589
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:47,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure they will

590
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:50,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they'll be selling as many as they can possibly sell.

591
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:52,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Sony sets those limits though, right?

592
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:56,592
[SPEAKER_00]: It stores the retailers how many they can sell to make sure that they fit all the orders.

593
00:40:56,652 --> 00:41:03,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, retailers will be setting those limits and most retailers, if the PS3 is a hot commodity, will have the one limit.

594
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:08,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably at launch, I think Sony's still going to pull out an ace somehow.

595
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:13,185
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to make this work somehow and have at least one title out there that the fanboys are going to have to have.

596
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:15,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I still say if you're going to buy one, pre-order it.

597
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Put down a reserve on it.

598
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:19,906
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the smart way to do it.

599
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:24,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all of you people who tried to go in and buy your Xbox 360 on launch day.

600
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:24,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha!

601
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:33,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't count on E3's bust for Sony, essentially, to be meaning that they're going to be easy to get.

602
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:35,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Stores are only going to get limited quantities.

603
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:37,880
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't pre-order it, I doubt you're going to get one on launch day.

604
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't matter anyways, because you're not going to get one on launch day even if you do pre-order it.

605
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:42,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the 360?

606
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:44,122
[SPEAKER_03]: People were getting them in March.

607
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:47,083
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who pre-ordered theirs first got theirs first.

608
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:49,784
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to be altering that, so it doesn't happen this time either.

609
00:41:50,224 --> 00:41:51,285
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't pre-order them right now.

610
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:56,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, you could have pre-ordered a 360 right now.

611
00:41:56,987 --> 00:41:58,007
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at this time last year.

612
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:01,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not doing that with the PlayStation 3 because they learned their lesson.

613
00:42:02,649 --> 00:42:04,050
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the big, big retailers.

614
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,451
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop and EB Games, as far as games go.

615
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:07,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, more mail.

616
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:15,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Another of our listeners asked if we know of any upcoming DVR games for PS2.

617
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:18,402
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Supernova.

618
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much the only one here in the States.

619
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:25,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure UK is getting Dancing Stage Supernova as well.

620
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Supernova, there's actually a little in-depth look on our website, and I think it's still on the front page.

621
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:32,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's rolled off yet.

622
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:36,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Over at www.orangenautorated.com, and there's video of it in motion and everything.

623
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:37,949
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from John, by the way.

624
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:38,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, John.

625
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,991
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's pretty much all there is to look forward to as far as DDR goes and Supernova.

626
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:45,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So far for the past, what,

627
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:51,616
[SPEAKER_02]: 5 years now, Konami's been putting out pretty regularly a new DDR game every year on Sony's platform.

628
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:59,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can count on probably another one next year as well, unless for some unknown reason Supernova doesn't sell, but I really don't see that happening.

629
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll sell just as well as the other games, if not better.

630
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:09,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one up is JVmon, who I am very, very proud of, writing a letter to the senator.

631
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:11,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, I remember talking about that on a previous episode.

632
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:16,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, just in closing, said, so any help and input would be greatly appreciated.

633
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:20,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love OLR, Sky and DarkSakura, you inspired me to write my senator.

634
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:22,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and Loki is awesome.

635
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:27,406
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm not going to go into it because it's fairly long already.

636
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:34,849
[SPEAKER_00]: But the arguments are basically what we've been talking about, about the parents' responsibility to decide what their children do.

637
00:43:36,638 --> 00:43:38,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to put the pen to the paper for you.

638
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:42,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the only suggestions we really have is just be professional.

639
00:43:43,006 --> 00:43:44,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you sound professional.

640
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Research your points.

641
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:47,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, best you can.

642
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:59,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you've been listening to, you read enough video game websites, especially things like Game Politics that really have their eye on these types of things, and listen to enough shows, you probably are well-educated on the subjects.

643
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Just write maturely.

644
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:06,946
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to, I say if you're trying to refute an argument, though, have facts to back up why you're refuting it and what's gonna, that's what I meant.

645
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:08,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.

646
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:10,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the facts there to support your argument.

647
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please don't write your senator a letter that says, Dear Senator, I am a registered voter.

648
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, you fucking fuck.

649
00:44:15,532 --> 00:44:18,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that because that's just going to get thrown away and you'll look stupid.

650
00:44:18,594 --> 00:44:19,554
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably laugh at you.

651
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:22,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you need to write something mature.

652
00:44:22,977 --> 00:44:32,463
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got an email from, I'm going to hopefully pronounce this right, Tasete Pueri, I guess.

653
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,424
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also, I think, in our chat room right now.

654
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:35,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

655
00:44:35,185 --> 00:44:35,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

656
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,382
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

657
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:01,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it all depends on what you're going for.

658
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:14,274
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something that's going to be a good work-oriented computer, something that you can run your programs well on, something you can do graphics in well, something that you can write on well, something that you can basically use as a work system, Mac is the way to go.

659
00:45:14,934 --> 00:45:18,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's going to be on a more professional level.

660
00:45:18,776 --> 00:45:22,857
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something that you can play games on and just futz around on the internet with, PC is the way to go.

661
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,418
[SPEAKER_02]: My advice, try before you buy.

662
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:28,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Any computer store, if you're going to make a major purchase like that,

663
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:32,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Any major computer store is going to have the computers out there on the show floor, especially like the Apple Store.

664
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they encourage people to be playing on their Macs.

665
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:40,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, any type of big retailer for PCs, Best Buy, Fry's, whatever, they have laptops out on the floor.

666
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it before you buy.

667
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:43,714
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, yeah.

668
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:44,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Take all the time you need.

669
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:45,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rush the decision.

670
00:45:46,315 --> 00:45:47,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, yeah, there's a bar mitzvah on Saturday, so.

671
00:45:47,715 --> 00:45:49,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazel tov.

672
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:50,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazel tov.

673
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:50,796
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

674
00:45:51,296 --> 00:45:54,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just thought that we would go ahead and give you our public yay.

675
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:55,438
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

676
00:45:55,478 --> 00:45:56,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

677
00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:56,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

678
00:45:57,294 --> 00:46:19,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy Todd writes in just to read the letter I just want to thank you for giving me something to listen to during work to help make the hours go by faster my job is a pretty boring job at times we won't tell your boss and having something to listen to really helps a lot I have been downloading a few older episodes of OLR and listen to them while I'm at work so thank you for providing such a good podcast to listen to in desperate times you're welcome

679
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:29,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We do this show for fun, and we always get a kick out of the fact that people listen to this and provide feedback and all that stuff, so it really keeps us motivated, so thank you.

680
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,929
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got an email from Tony.

681
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:38,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a chance to watch the file yet, so I'm just going to read the email.

682
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:42,616
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just watched a rerun of the Colbert Report on Comedy Central for June 8th.

683
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you don't watch a lot of TV, so I'll forgive you for that.

684
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually the Colbert Report.

685
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I don't watch TV.

686
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:49,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you don't watch TV, but...

687
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:58,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Steven's guest explains how video games are actually helping this generation of kids and implies that GTA might contribute to this nation's decrease in carjackings and teen pregnancies.

688
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:06,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all done... The show is a parody, essentially, of shows like The O'Reilly Factor, and so it's all very tongue-in-cheek when they do that stuff.

689
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:07,105
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a point, though.

690
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:16,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see how maybe World of Warcraft would lead to decline of pregnancy because they're too busy playing the video game in order to, I don't know, have sex.

691
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:17,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

692
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Sex or an instance?

693
00:47:19,428 --> 00:47:19,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Sex or an instance?

694
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:55,228
[SPEAKER_02]: sex is any time and instance is in like two minutes seriously I don't know it depends on sometimes sex is an instance but hey alright anyway la la la la la la that's it alright if you want to send us emails please do mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com

695
00:47:55,982 --> 00:47:59,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, speaking of MMOs and sex and instances, what a good follow-up.

696
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:01,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a story for us.

697
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:08,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, lots of gamers are finding love online in fake virtual worlds like World of Warcraft and whatnot.

698
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:23,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, a survey conducted by Stanford University's Nick Yee, a PhD student there, found that 29% of women and 8% of men have admitted to have gone on dates with people that they've met in the games.

699
00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:24,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And the

700
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:30,119
[SPEAKER_03]: He attributes that phenomenon to the trust-building exercises of working in team scenarios.

701
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:39,986
[SPEAKER_03]: How one player acts during an in-game raid may reveal traits relative to the avatar's personality through situations that are less common in the real world.

702
00:48:40,426 --> 00:48:44,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So, say for example, we would take, you know, Leroy Jenkins.

703
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:48,191
[SPEAKER_03]: He might rush into things a little bit, you know, too quickly.

704
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,192
[SPEAKER_03]: He might not be a good mate.

705
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:53,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh... I don't know.

706
00:48:55,398 --> 00:49:00,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting they mentioned one guy was setting up for two weddings, one in real life and one in game.

707
00:49:02,263 --> 00:49:02,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd!

708
00:49:03,144 --> 00:49:04,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

709
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:06,566
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I met my husband online.

710
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:09,788
[SPEAKER_00]: You know... Through our geekdom.

711
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:12,690
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I realized in this...

712
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:17,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Day and age that we live in, the internet is a place that we can meet people.

713
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:24,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember back in the day, maybe if you have an older brother or sister, they talked about party lines that you could call into on the phone.

714
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:25,896
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what chat rooms are.

715
00:49:26,237 --> 00:49:27,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It's party lines, basically.

716
00:49:27,218 --> 00:49:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

717
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:32,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Cybersex is like phone sex too.

718
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:38,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you throw the MMO into it, it does get a little weird.

719
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:42,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, because people are like roleplaying elves and dwarves and all that.

720
00:49:42,725 --> 00:49:47,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, you were a hot elf in that game, but now you're a fat cow.

721
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:50,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, this kind of mixes things up a bit.

722
00:49:50,427 --> 00:49:52,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know, I'm not going to knock.

723
00:49:53,564 --> 00:49:54,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Two people falling in love.

724
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's genuine, you know what?

725
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:58,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Love's a great thing.

726
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter how it happened.

727
00:49:59,565 --> 00:49:59,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

728
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:05,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Dan's high school photo to go on when we first met.

729
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:08,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, I was 22 when I moved out here.

730
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,088
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it was that long ago.

731
00:50:13,128 --> 00:50:21,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was great because we actually got to know each other as people without having the whole

732
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:28,305
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it is important, though, to make sure that the person that you're talking to is not looking like a yeti.

733
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:57,768
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it matters what the other person looks like as long as their heart is good and you love them for themselves.

734
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeti people need love too, Loki.

735
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:00,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

736
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:04,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean you have to love them, but you know...

737
00:51:04,656 --> 00:51:06,237
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, somebody might have a Yeti fetish.

738
00:51:06,517 --> 00:51:07,057
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know.

739
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:08,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are furry fetishes out there.

740
00:51:08,918 --> 00:51:21,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really sad, though, just how much people base their whole relationship on, oh, well, this person's hot, or, oh, well, this person is this, you know, aesthetically, instead of actually putting the importance on who they are on the inside.

741
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:27,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that, I honestly think that you open yourself up for a lot of risk.

742
00:51:27,225 --> 00:51:32,647
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do happen to hit pay dirt, then you're going to get someone who I think is a bit,

743
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:37,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you have a chance of getting a more genuine person when you do find somebody.

744
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:45,558
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm looking for a good running car or whatever, I don't want one that's all beat up on the outside.

745
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:56,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I am from somebody who said that two of her friends met on World of Warcraft and got married three months ago.

746
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:57,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

747
00:51:58,221 --> 00:51:58,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

748
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:00,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

749
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:20,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them do whatever they want.

750
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:24,661
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to roleplay taurens and orcs in the bedroom, have fun.

751
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:25,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your thing.

752
00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:27,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put it on YouTube.

753
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:28,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to see it.

754
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:39,811
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I think that people who meet through online methods, whether it be an MMO, whether it be through a chat, through a message board, if it works for you, more power to you.

755
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:40,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at a bar.

756
00:52:41,072 --> 00:52:41,372
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

757
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Picking up people at a bar is pretty scummy.

758
00:52:43,814 --> 00:52:44,694
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not always.

759
00:52:44,754 --> 00:52:45,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Not always, but you know what?

760
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:46,876
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times it can be.

761
00:52:47,603 --> 00:52:49,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Bars are pretty sleazy sometimes.

762
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:50,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know what?

763
00:52:53,447 --> 00:52:54,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Meet people at church.

764
00:52:54,328 --> 00:52:56,169
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only clean place.

765
00:52:56,269 --> 00:52:57,570
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a clean place.

766
00:52:58,071 --> 00:52:59,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Church going people.

767
00:52:59,772 --> 00:52:59,932
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

768
00:53:00,312 --> 00:53:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

769
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:01,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

770
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob in our chat room says, well, what about those balloon fetish people?

771
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:07,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop a balloon and they'll be all over you.

772
00:53:08,538 --> 00:53:10,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling someone missed the point there.

773
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,720
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

774
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:14,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirty Thief said someone's going to bang a chocobo.

775
00:53:15,816 --> 00:53:20,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And in reference to doing the MMOs, sex and the MMOs.

776
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, you kids have a lot of free time.

777
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

778
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:29,883
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do play too many video games, you might need to take a trip to the Netherlands.

779
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:33,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have set up an addiction center.

780
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:38,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first detox clinic for video game addicts.

781
00:53:39,154 --> 00:53:50,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games may look innocent, but they can be just as addictive as gambling or drugs and just as hard to kick, says Keith Backer, director of Amsterdam-based Smith & Jones Addiction Consultants.

782
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,163
[SPEAKER_02]: He's already treated 20 video game addicts aged 13 to 30.

783
00:53:57,104 --> 00:54:00,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them will show withdrawal systems, shaking, sweating, whatever.

784
00:54:01,006 --> 00:54:03,227
[SPEAKER_02]: His detox program begins in July 2021.

785
00:54:03,587 --> 00:54:11,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs 4-8 weeks and has therapy sessions, wilderness excursions, healthy lifestyle workshops, and possibly medication.

786
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, another quote here from Backer.

787
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:22,554
[SPEAKER_02]: We have kids who don't know how to communicate with people face-to-face because they've spent the last three years talking to somebody in Korea through a computer.

788
00:54:22,894 --> 00:54:25,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Their social network has completely disappeared.

789
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey, they can't be blaming this on Korea.

790
00:54:29,884 --> 00:54:31,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Hike van der Heijen 28 was a graduate of the Amsterdam side of this.

791
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:32,987
[SPEAKER_02]: He started playing video games when he was 8.

792
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:36,831
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time he was in college, he was gaming 14 hours a day and using drugs to play longer, which is

793
00:54:52,526 --> 00:54:53,006
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pathetic.

794
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:54,447
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other problem.

795
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:56,128
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a gaming problem.

796
00:54:56,148 --> 00:54:57,048
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other problem.

797
00:54:57,068 --> 00:54:59,349
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called obsessive compulsive disorder.

798
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:01,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that count as cheating on live?

799
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting coked up before playing?

800
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,293
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm on speed, I have that advantage.

801
00:55:07,994 --> 00:55:08,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say the quote, please?

802
00:55:08,994 --> 00:55:09,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the quote from the kid.

803
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:14,857
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, one joint would never be enough, or five minutes of gaming would never be enough, he said.

804
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:17,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just keep going until I crashed out.

805
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:33,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so like when I first read about this story, I was kind of laughing at it, because my thought went to, you know, I've been downtown all week at the courthouse, you know, during the jury duty, and one of the things I walk by is a, I'm not, I don't want to knock

806
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:44,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to name what religion it is, but you go by a very religious type of like a store type thing, and they have in the window, do you have a gaming addiction problem?

807
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:47,079
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's listed in listening.

808
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:50,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, are you addicted to sex, violence, gaming?

809
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:51,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like...

810
00:55:52,512 --> 00:55:55,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy, you know, I just kind of roll my eyes at it and keep on walking.

811
00:55:55,473 --> 00:56:00,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, these guys that I'm reading about in this story, they really do have problems and do need some type of intervention.

812
00:56:00,636 --> 00:56:02,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this isn't such a bad idea as it seems.

813
00:56:03,137 --> 00:56:08,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the media is just kind of putting a spin on this story where, you know, it's about, you know, oh, it's gaming.

814
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:11,601
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, they're obsessed with gaming and gaming is the problem.

815
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:14,222
[SPEAKER_02]: No, these guys obviously have a lot of other problems.

816
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:14,582
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something.

817
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:15,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Underline.

818
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:16,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming just contributes too.

819
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:20,469
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start reading these testimonials, I mean, if he was doing drugs too, that's a whole nother problem.

820
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:23,093
[SPEAKER_02]: He was getting sex, he wouldn't have any of these problems.

821
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:27,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So the moral of the story, kids, you know, what was one of the treatments here?

822
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilderness excursions.

823
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:30,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy.

824
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:32,822
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go on your own wilderness excursion.

825
00:56:32,862 --> 00:56:33,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what you do.

826
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:39,505
[SPEAKER_02]: After you've played the game, like if you've played the game for more than like four hours a day, it's time to go outside for an hour.

827
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:44,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk around, breathe in some fresh air, take a wilderness excursion, and don't let this become you.

828
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if wilderness excursions are a good idea.

829
00:56:46,728 --> 00:56:48,609
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think LARPs came around?

830
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:50,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do we really need more of that?

831
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, LARPs are, I used to do LARPs.

832
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I could play games outside!

833
00:56:59,504 --> 00:57:00,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

834
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:01,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Fireball!

835
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:04,868
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as going to reenactments.

836
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Reenactments actually have historical significance.

837
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:07,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

838
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:09,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Or going to Ren Faire.

839
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It's reenact the Civil War, but this time the South won.

840
00:57:15,556 --> 00:57:19,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not one to knock what somebody else is into, but I did go to a Ren Faire once.

841
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:22,256
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of roll my eyes at it.

842
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:22,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

843
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:23,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't for me.

844
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:25,078
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to... A Ren Faire is fun.

845
00:57:25,138 --> 00:57:26,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to knock people... Whatever.

846
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,720
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do what makes you happy.

847
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:33,545
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about getting your pint of ale and chatting up the men in tights.

848
00:57:33,805 --> 00:57:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: A Ren Faire is like... Maybe the Ren Faire I went to just sucked.

849
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:36,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

850
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:38,069
[SPEAKER_03]: A Ren Faire is just like an old-fashioned Hooters.

851
00:57:38,189 --> 00:57:39,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of boobs, lots of chicken.

852
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's basically what it is.

853
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:43,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's nothing wrong with a Ren Faire.

854
00:57:44,034 --> 00:57:46,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, you get to see people fight with swords.

855
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:47,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of cool.

856
00:57:47,957 --> 00:57:50,099
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing missing from Hooters is sword fighting.

857
00:57:55,327 --> 00:57:57,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I wonder why we have you on the show, Loki.

858
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:59,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you say little gems like that to remind me.

859
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another story now.

860
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:05,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm curious what the chat room has to say in feedback to the detox story here.

861
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:06,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

862
00:58:11,018 --> 00:58:13,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Raven's Dolphin says they need an OLR clinic.

863
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I am addicted.

864
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's lovely.

865
00:58:15,602 --> 00:58:23,827
[SPEAKER_02]: But just remember, you can put Orange Lounge Radio on your iPod or whatever MP3 player you have, and you can go outside and take a walk and listen to Orange Lounge Radio if you wanted to.

866
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:26,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you have another story for us.

867
00:58:27,342 --> 00:58:33,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's about the Federal Trade Commission and their never-ending quest to waste my tax money.

868
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:49,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they've investigated the hot coffee problem and they found out that, well, apparently Take-Two didn't fully reveal the content of the PC versions to the ESRB.

869
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what are they doing?

870
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're saying, better not do it again or else we'll fine you.

871
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:57,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

872
00:58:58,332 --> 00:59:04,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to fine them, supposedly, a civil fine up to $11,000 per violation.

873
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:12,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, what the violation may be, or if it's per title, or per copy sold, oh, none of that was ever said.

874
00:59:13,135 --> 00:59:16,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I knew more about what Take-Two kind of defended themselves with in this.

875
00:59:17,813 --> 00:59:18,293
[SPEAKER_00]: A machete.

876
00:59:18,694 --> 00:59:21,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have been like, listen, bitch, we didn't fucking put it in the game.

877
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Some person hacked it in there.

878
00:59:23,758 --> 00:59:26,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you that goddamn dumb that you can't see this?

879
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,603
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, no, but games suck.

880
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the disc, Loki, though.

881
00:59:31,364 --> 00:59:32,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the disc.

882
00:59:32,785 --> 00:59:33,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be a devil's advocate.

883
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:36,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not accessible by normal means.

884
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:37,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lazy.

885
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I go back to my old, it was lazy programming.

886
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:41,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think it was so much lazy.

887
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:44,735
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in games all the time.

888
00:59:44,775 --> 00:59:47,377
[SPEAKER_02]: They took out the pointer and somebody put it back in with a hack code.

889
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:50,313
[SPEAKER_02]: So dumb, it's so dumb!

890
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:53,883
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, you have to do other stuff in addition to it, so...

891
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:59,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous, and the fact that they're wasting our money investigating this?

892
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:00,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for what?

893
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:03,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, to prove that this is a mature-rated game?

894
01:00:03,473 --> 01:00:10,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like saying, oh, well, this R-rated movie said it only had blood and violence, but I was totally shocked when I saw the boobies in there, too.

895
01:00:10,956 --> 01:00:13,097
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ PooEater over in chatroom says, What?

896
01:00:13,418 --> 01:00:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: A breast?

897
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an AO game now.

898
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:18,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But the killing and use of the word nigga is cool.

899
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:19,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

900
01:00:21,262 --> 01:00:21,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.

901
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:26,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's like the whole thing with movies and full frontal nudity when it comes to guys.

902
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:34,678
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's okay in an R-rated movie, but when you get a naked guy in there, oh, NC-17, oh my god, horrible.

903
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing with this, you know, once you add a little bit of nudity in there.

904
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:43,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And, which, you know, if you think about it... Actually, in the 70s, it wasn't a big deal at all.

905
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:46,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you go look at movies that were made in the 70s, like Porky's.

906
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:47,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Life of Brian.

907
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:50,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's Wang left and right in those movies, you know?

908
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:51,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about... They were just art.

909
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:56,159
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, like, God of War, where there's actual, you know, nudity in that.

910
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:00,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had a sex game, and they're granted, they didn't show anything, but...

911
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:07,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you saw this game and actually played the hot coffee game or whatever, you would have been, this is ridiculous and stupid.

912
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:08,899
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a sex game.

913
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:11,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about as ridiculous as Custard's Revenge.

914
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it didn't really show anything.

915
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:24,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It just showed some stupid, really low-res models dry-humping each other, basically, and a woman, you know, climaxing, I guess, when this meter got up.

916
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:25,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's ridiculous.

917
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:27,025
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

918
01:01:28,733 --> 01:01:33,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's continue moving on talking about video games and their reputation out there.

919
01:01:34,577 --> 01:01:35,938
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a columnist.

920
01:01:36,038 --> 01:01:37,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It's John Roseman.

921
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:39,240
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a syndicated Christian columnist.

922
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,882
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got 11 books on parenting.

923
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:50,228
[SPEAKER_02]: He believes that collective common sense concerning children has been swamped by tidal waves of psychobabble that's lasted some 40 years now.

924
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:55,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, he had a column that ran in Monday's edition of the Charlotte Observer.

925
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:56,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give you a quote from it.

926
01:01:56,932 --> 01:02:01,715
[SPEAKER_02]: When video games first came out, I warned my readers that they were not appropriate for children.

927
01:02:02,156 --> 01:02:04,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I maintained that they were not games, rather.

928
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:06,879
[SPEAKER_02]: They produced stress and were addictive, literally.

929
01:02:07,299 --> 01:02:08,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not a popular stance.

930
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:16,465
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, before entering into it, I told you so story about a mother and father dealing with introducing video games into their lives, their young children.

931
01:02:16,745 --> 01:02:18,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some other gem quotes from the article here.

932
01:02:19,147 --> 01:02:24,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, since then, hundreds of parents have shared with me their negative experiences with these nefarious devices.

933
01:02:25,211 --> 01:02:27,332
[SPEAKER_02]: The stories go in my I told you so file.

934
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:31,074
[SPEAKER_02]: The following, written by the mother of several young children, is the latest edition.

935
01:02:31,434 --> 01:02:31,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Another quote.

936
01:02:32,414 --> 01:02:34,755
[SPEAKER_02]: When they played, there would be fighting and tears.

937
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:38,557
[SPEAKER_02]: When the parents turned it off, the kids would mope around to complain of having nothing to do.

938
01:02:38,937 --> 01:02:43,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Were these the same children who pre-Xbox have never had a problem entertaining themselves?

939
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they were not the same children at all.

940
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:55,786
[SPEAKER_02]: They were beginning to exhibit addictive behavior, and as anyone who has ever lived with one will testify, an addict and the former non-addict are two entirely different people.

941
01:02:57,087 --> 01:02:58,988
[SPEAKER_02]: The story ends with a warning to all parents.

942
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:02,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I firmly believe that video games are dangerous to children and families.

943
01:03:02,931 --> 01:03:03,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not buy one.

944
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:04,872
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot control it.

945
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,793
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.

946
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:11,742
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I love how this guy says, when video games first came out, I warned my readers.

947
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So this guy was writing columns when Space War first came out?

948
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:15,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Pong?

949
01:03:15,645 --> 01:03:18,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what, in the early 70s, late 60s?

950
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:18,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

951
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:22,351
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there were games well before that, too.

952
01:03:22,572 --> 01:03:24,113
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about board games, huh?

953
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:25,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Are board games addictive?

954
01:03:25,755 --> 01:03:30,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or when it rains outside and the children mope around because they can't go outside and play football?

955
01:03:31,078 --> 01:03:33,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's just how children are.

956
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:37,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that you give them a sit and spin, right?

957
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:37,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

958
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:38,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take it away.

959
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:40,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sit and spin was their favorite thing to do.

960
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:42,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how are they going to act?

961
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:43,128
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to cry.

962
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:43,749
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be mopey.

963
01:03:43,769 --> 01:03:47,392
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got multiple children and you've got a single thing, they're going to fight over it.

964
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:49,194
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how siblings are.

965
01:03:49,914 --> 01:03:54,456
[SPEAKER_02]: If a child's moping around that they have nothing to do, have them do the dishes or mop the floor.

966
01:03:55,617 --> 01:03:57,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my mom made me do.

967
01:03:58,018 --> 01:04:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I never was to complain I have nothing to do.

968
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,201
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom always said, if you tell me you have nothing to do, I'll find something for you to do.

969
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:06,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew how to do laundry when I was six years old.

970
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give me this nothing to do crap.

971
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:10,844
[SPEAKER_00]: You have children to do your housework for you.

972
01:04:10,964 --> 01:04:17,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you didn't sit your kids in front of the TV and just have the TV raise them, and then when you take that away, then they don't have anything to do.

973
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:22,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you should teach them, I don't know, to use their imagination or maybe play with toys.

974
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:23,948
[SPEAKER_03]: My cousin was the same way.

975
01:04:24,448 --> 01:04:30,550
[SPEAKER_03]: You would give him Legos and he wouldn't know what to do with them because no one taught him how to play by himself or entertain himself.

976
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:36,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, they would have to entertain him by either putting a movie on or something like that.

977
01:04:36,552 --> 01:04:38,173
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have video games, but you know,

978
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,967
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the same difference.

979
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:40,947
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the same thing.

980
01:04:41,047 --> 01:05:00,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, you don't teach your kids, because, oh my god, you know, having the kid and stuff was so much stress and stuff, and now we don't have time to ourselves, and oh, I'm just so tired with this, and now I need something to entertain my kids, and now they won't get along, and it's all this video game stuff, because they must have been addicted to it.

981
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:02,655
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're not addicted to the game.

982
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:05,176
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just kids, and they whine, and

983
01:05:05,316 --> 01:05:06,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

984
01:05:19,675 --> 01:05:28,499
[SPEAKER_00]: What I used to do with my little brothers, because my little brothers are about, the oldest of them is seven years younger than I am.

985
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:35,182
[SPEAKER_00]: When my mom would be busy, I would teach them how to do something and say, okay, go do this.

986
01:05:35,582 --> 01:05:37,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come back, I want to see what you've done.

987
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I would break out the Lincoln Logs.

988
01:05:39,704 --> 01:05:41,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Lincoln Logs when I was a kid.

989
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:42,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I break out the Lincoln Logs, come back.

990
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:43,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I was Tinker Toy Kid.

991
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:45,207
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Tinker Toys too.

992
01:05:45,848 --> 01:05:49,550
[SPEAKER_00]: My brothers would have built like a whole fort out of stuff because I showed them how to put them together.

993
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the large size Tinker Toys.

994
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:53,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that were like ginormous.

995
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:54,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Tinker Toy times 100.

996
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:57,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go to chat room because they have some great comments right now.

997
01:05:57,735 --> 01:06:02,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says, Sky, this guy is nothing more than the advocate of the American Taliban.

998
01:06:02,738 --> 01:06:04,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some harsh words, but okay.

999
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:05,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your quote, not mine.

1000
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1001
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:09,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they start talking about board games.

1002
01:06:09,422 --> 01:06:11,223
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room is just going off on board games here.

1003
01:06:11,544 --> 01:06:14,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireboma says Monopoly causes domestic violence.

1004
01:06:14,572 --> 01:06:17,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen a family fight over a good old-fashioned game of Monopoly?

1005
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:18,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1006
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:27,140
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends' favorite stories that they always make me tell whenever we're drinking or whatever is the story about my mom and I fighting over the bag of M&M's.

1007
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:29,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, families fight over the dumbest shit.

1008
01:06:30,101 --> 01:06:30,662
[SPEAKER_02]: They really do.

1009
01:06:31,282 --> 01:06:31,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1010
01:06:31,622 --> 01:06:32,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Siblings fight vicious.

1011
01:06:32,803 --> 01:06:35,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says Frogger is animal cruelty.

1012
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:37,605
[SPEAKER_02]: GS191, think about the children.

1013
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:38,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Ban Connect 4.

1014
01:06:39,946 --> 01:06:40,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1015
01:06:40,606 --> 01:06:43,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says Mystery Date causes premarital sex.

1016
01:06:44,738 --> 01:06:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireboma says life, you know, the game of life, causes kids to think that having children out of wedlock is okay.

1017
01:06:51,601 --> 01:06:52,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So, get this.

1018
01:06:55,163 --> 01:06:58,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, toys are even more dangerous than video games, I think.

1019
01:06:58,605 --> 01:07:01,746
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Linkin Logs, they make great catapults.

1020
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:05,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, those... What was it?

1021
01:07:05,968 --> 01:07:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Not K'nex, but... Oh, God.

1022
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to make... Tinker Toys?

1023
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,351
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Tinker Toys.

1024
01:07:11,391 --> 01:07:13,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have the life-size Tinker Toys, and those things were...

1025
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:23,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember flicking the little circular knob off of the stick when you pull it back and then flick it off the stick and I used to hit my brother in the head with that all the time.

1026
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:24,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why he's a marine now.

1027
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:28,729
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think the video games are dangerous, try dealing with a kid with a crossbow.

1028
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:37,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1029
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this comment is really good, too.

1030
01:07:39,032 --> 01:07:40,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share this so we can move on here.

1031
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:49,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze in our chatroom says, I'm a devout Christian, and I hate these people who are on a useless crusade to try and reform society through their political bullshit.

1032
01:07:51,121 --> 01:07:51,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.

1033
01:07:52,962 --> 01:07:53,302
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1034
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,364
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't a pun, by the way.

1035
01:07:55,484 --> 01:07:56,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

1036
01:07:56,925 --> 01:07:59,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had these very strange puns come out of nowhere tonight.

1037
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:01,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make daddy taught daughters to sneak out at night.

1038
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:04,711
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a game to teach me how to sneak out of the house.

1039
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:07,258
[SPEAKER_02]: What did the game Cootie teach us?

1040
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:07,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

1041
01:08:08,179 --> 01:08:08,959
[SPEAKER_00]: How to play with bugs.

1042
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:29,788
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1043
01:08:52,441 --> 01:09:00,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a lot of research into food and eating, given that I've been looking for natural treatments for the chronic fatigue immunodeficiency syndrome.

1044
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:42,710
[SPEAKER_00]: which I try not to go off on that one but I've been trying to do a lot of natural you know research into how to naturally treat it and they're basically stating that a lot of the the ideals that were taught as children by our parents who of course learn this from their parents learn it from their parents are you know not necessarily the best thing to actually do

1045
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:46,072
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're taught to clean your plate no matter how full you are.

1046
01:09:46,452 --> 01:09:48,954
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you grow up, you're taught to overeat.

1047
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:52,035
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are full, you're done, not when you're satisfied.

1048
01:09:52,775 --> 01:10:05,221
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of that, plus a lot of, you know, a lot of the different, you know, technology we have now that basically promotes being lazy, you know, a lot of easy food, things that are packed full of calories and bad for you.

1049
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:10,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, our society is built around a very, very vicious relationship with food.

1050
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:16,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I personally am trying to go into breaking some of those habits of myself.

1051
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:20,968
[SPEAKER_00]: But I encourage, you know, parents, when your child says they're full, don't make them eat anymore.

1052
01:10:22,029 --> 01:10:22,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with them young.

1053
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:24,850
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, teach them how to go out and play.

1054
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach them how to eat right.

1055
01:10:27,091 --> 01:10:31,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make them clean their plate, because if they're satisfied, there's no need to stuff them.

1056
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:33,094
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have to say.

1057
01:10:34,035 --> 01:10:34,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, ref you.

1058
01:10:35,195 --> 01:10:37,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, fuck you to think I... Yeah!

1059
01:10:37,537 --> 01:10:38,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!

1060
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:39,712
[SPEAKER_03]: You got pink eye this week?

1061
01:10:40,332 --> 01:10:41,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess so.

1062
01:10:42,073 --> 01:10:47,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, conjunctivitis, but they basically said that's pink eye, but I guess it's just it sucks.

1063
01:10:47,834 --> 01:10:48,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it really conjunctivitis?

1064
01:10:49,294 --> 01:10:49,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.

1065
01:10:52,134 --> 01:10:53,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm throwing it towards you.

1066
01:10:55,175 --> 01:10:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway.

1067
01:10:56,435 --> 01:10:59,296
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it's just conjunctivitis or whatever.

1068
01:11:01,096 --> 01:11:03,336
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks, seeing his eyes all red.

1069
01:11:03,356 --> 01:11:04,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't hurt, though, so that's kind of good.

1070
01:11:04,657 --> 01:11:07,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really annoying having your eye water all day.

1071
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:10,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that's about it.

1072
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:17,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, uh, my FU of the week goes to my sinus issues or whatever, because you guys were listening to last week's show, I was sick.

1073
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:21,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I still, I feel, it's something about the weekends are making me sick lately, because I'm sick again.

1074
01:11:21,431 --> 01:11:26,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I woke up this morning feeling all, you know, congesty and stuff, and it sucks.

1075
01:11:26,273 --> 01:11:26,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate being sick.

1076
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:27,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Go away.

1077
01:11:27,733 --> 01:11:29,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not supposed to have allergies and sinus problems.

1078
01:11:29,714 --> 01:11:30,154
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.

1079
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making me sleep too much.

1080
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:34,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1081
01:11:35,737 --> 01:11:36,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our angst for the week.

1082
01:11:37,078 --> 01:11:38,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

1083
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:43,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go over to DarkSakura, as you know she likes to keep an eye on what's going on overseas.

1084
01:11:44,142 --> 01:11:45,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is going on overseas?

1085
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:47,063
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of stuff.

1086
01:11:48,424 --> 01:11:48,924
[SPEAKER_00]: No, seriously.

1087
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:54,407
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some UK gaming events going on.

1088
01:11:54,907 --> 01:11:59,330
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that it's a good idea for our overseas listeners.

1089
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,472
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like to make sure that they stay in touch, so...

1090

[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's the Women in Games UK at the University of Teesside, uh, 10th through 11th in July.

01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:53,702
[SPEAKER_00]: information on DirectX10.

[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the games edu conference in Brighton the 14th of July.

[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these games.

1118
01:14:06,381 --> 01:14:09,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But this might be one I actually want to check out, Loki, right?

1119
01:14:09,822 --> 01:14:10,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1120
01:14:10,783 --> 01:14:12,243
[SPEAKER_03]: They've announced Hell Tycoon.

01:14:12,773 --> 01:14:15,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, announced it on Tuesday, which was June 6, 2006.

1122
01:14:15,676 --> 01:14:17,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure this wasn't a joke?

1123
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:18,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1124
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:22,582
[SPEAKER_03]: The official website is up right now, and you can go check it out, of course.

1125
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:26,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, it should be interesting.

1126
01:14:26,526 --> 01:14:28,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's healthhycoon.com, obviously.

1127
01:14:28,788 --> 01:14:35,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, you have to manage the misery of others and make sure that...

1128
01:14:38,634 --> 01:14:40,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I so will play this game.

1129
01:14:40,437 --> 01:14:41,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to the site right now.

1130
01:14:41,438 --> 01:14:42,520
[SPEAKER_02]: This site has noise, right?

1131
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it does.

1132
01:14:43,341 --> 01:14:46,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you guys might hear this come up on the screen, but I have to see this for myself.

1133
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:49,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's pretty awesome.

1134
01:14:49,831 --> 01:14:50,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Loading, loading, loading.

1135
01:14:50,773 --> 01:14:51,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1136
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:51,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1137
01:14:53,024 --> 01:14:53,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.

1138
01:14:54,565 --> 01:14:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Evil noises.

1139
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:59,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it says, When Armageddon comes, the demon armies of hells will be defeated.

1140
01:15:00,148 --> 01:15:01,109
[SPEAKER_03]: This can only mean one thing.

1141
01:15:01,149 --> 01:15:02,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The devil isn't doing his job.

1142
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:04,050
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the new ruler of hell.

1143
01:15:04,471 --> 01:15:09,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Your job is to keep Abyss stocked with torqued souls, reform all nine planes of hell with fire and brimstone.

1144
01:15:10,154 --> 01:15:11,835
[SPEAKER_03]: On Judgment Day, will you be ready?

1145
01:15:12,035 --> 01:15:15,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's no secret that politicians are controlled by the devil.

1146
01:15:16,077 --> 01:15:18,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you know why Washington, D.C.

1147
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:21,160
[SPEAKER_03]: is built around a giant pentagram.

1148
01:15:22,494 --> 01:15:23,634
[SPEAKER_02]: This scene just goes on and on.

1149
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:27,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny, so go check it out.

1150
01:15:27,855 --> 01:15:29,976
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get the makers of Hell Tycoon on this program.

1151
01:15:29,996 --> 01:15:32,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk to them and find out what's wrong with them.

1152
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:35,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, how messed up do you have to be to think of something like this?

1153
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:37,317
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1154
01:15:37,897 --> 01:15:40,078
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually sounds kind of smart.

1155
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:42,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check this out, I think, when it comes out.

1156
01:15:43,519 --> 01:15:43,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1157
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:47,299
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Dartetsuya says, sounds like Loki's kind of game, actually.

1158
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Dole says, that sounds awesome.

1159
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,361
[SPEAKER_02]: HitStun wants to know, does anybody own the Tycoon name?

1160
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:56,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not, because you see all these Tycoon games, like, all the time.

1161
01:15:57,281 --> 01:16:01,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And JeremyTodd1 made the mandatory joke, I suppose, beating this joke into the ground.

1162
01:16:02,323 --> 01:16:03,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Giant Enemy Crab cartoon.

1163
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:04,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Tycoon.

1164
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:09,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Journey Tycoon, where you manage the band journey.

1165
01:16:09,324 --> 01:16:17,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of a joke that never gets old, Uwe Boll has sued the distributor of Blood Rain.

1166
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:19,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1167
01:16:35,945 --> 01:16:44,690
[SPEAKER_02]: refusing to pay the producers their share of the gross proceeds and not using the $10 million that Bull's production company had given them for promotion and advertising of the film.

1168
01:16:45,771 --> 01:16:50,914
[SPEAKER_02]: This suit has been confirmed that it is going on there, but who knows what will actually happen with that.

1169
01:16:50,974 --> 01:16:51,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1170
01:16:51,614 --> 01:16:54,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to look for a comment here.

1171
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:56,037
[SPEAKER_02]: They did comment and basically...

1172
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:57,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was all bullshit.

1173
01:16:57,931 --> 01:16:58,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's see.

1174
01:16:58,351 --> 01:17:01,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Romar Entertainment co-founder Jane Schramm had a comment here.

1175
01:17:01,973 --> 01:17:05,534
[SPEAKER_02]: He had such bad publicity that I felt bad and I wanted to help him out.

1176
01:17:05,835 --> 01:17:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: We made no money on this movie.

1177
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:07,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1178
01:17:07,776 --> 01:17:08,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost.

1179
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:09,877
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a complete financial loss.

1180
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has the audacity to remove us off the credits.

1181
01:17:13,058 --> 01:17:14,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was the thing.

1182
01:17:14,519 --> 01:17:17,400
[SPEAKER_03]: When the DVD came out, they removed them off the credits.

1183
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:18,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1184
01:17:18,961 --> 01:17:24,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And they made it look like it was distributed by Uwe Boll instead of Romar.

1185
01:17:25,572 --> 01:17:27,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, he's a jackass.

1186
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:32,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have known because there's no way I'm going to watch that DVD.

1187
01:17:33,117 --> 01:17:33,417
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1188
01:17:33,477 --> 01:17:35,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

1189
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:38,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we come back, there'll be plenty more Orange Lounge Radio where this came from.

1190
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see you in a little bit.
