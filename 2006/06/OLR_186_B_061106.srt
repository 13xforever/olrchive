2
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:26,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is, episode number 186 for this June the 11th of 2006.

4
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:31,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And Loki's going to start off this set with a piece of news about the PlayStation 3.

5
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:33,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ooh, the PlayStation 3.

6
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:42,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, they're saying that the early units are going to have the hardware to play the original, or the PlayStation 2 stuff.

7
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:45,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're going to have PlayStation 2 hardware inside to be able to play the older games.

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,821
[SPEAKER_08]: And later, as time goes on, and they've

9
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:49,794
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

10
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

11
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,913
[SPEAKER_08]: This time around, though, it's going to be more hardware than just one chip.

12
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:17,935
[SPEAKER_10]: But you could upscale on the original plate.

13
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:19,696
[SPEAKER_10]: You could do the faster loading and all that stuff.

14
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:23,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the thing is they have the original chip in there to be able to do that.

15
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like this is going to have the PlayStation 2 hardware built in, but you can still upscale that.

16
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:31,424
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't have anything to do with it.

17
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:35,287
[SPEAKER_08]: But later on, they're going to be going completely software with this.

18
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:43,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So this means that it's going to be even more hardware crammed inside of this thing, and as it is, I think they're having trouble fitting in the hardware in that case.

19
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:48,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's going to end up being larger than the original Xbox by the time they're done with it.

20
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:49,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we'll see.

21
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,130
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

22
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:53,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch JP had an interview with Ken Kutaragi regarding the PlayStation 3.

23
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:15,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically what happened is that the PlayStation 3 is, Kudaragi calls it a configuration, not a model.

24
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:22,639
[SPEAKER_10]: He says Sony wants to upgrade all aspects of the console as time goes on, like the hard drive size, maybe even the CPU specs.

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony may release an upgraded version of the console every year.

26
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:31,167
[SPEAKER_10]: And Sony is really not thinking about the price or anything here.

27
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:32,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the direct quote.

28
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:36,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's okay to release an extended configuration every year, laugh.

29
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:39,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Though I say it like a joke, Dell will do it and Apple will do it too.

30
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:42,995
[SPEAKER_10]: In PC, if you fix the spec for two years, you'll be caught up.

31
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:44,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Computers should be changing, right?

32
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,976
[SPEAKER_10]: It's inevitable that 60 gigabytes will become short.

33
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Memory may become short too.

34
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:50,857
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many possibilities.

35
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:54,298
[SPEAKER_10]: So in other words, if you become an early adopter of the PlayStation 3...

36
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:57,332
[SPEAKER_10]: You may get screwed on this stuff.

37
00:02:58,372 --> 00:02:59,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a console.

38
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a PC.

39
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:05,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're thinking it's a PC, but if it's a PC, then get into the goddamn PC market.

40
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:06,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't try to push this crap.

41
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a fucking VAIO.

42
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,116
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a goddamn PlayStation.

43
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:13,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, DarkSakura might have more info here on what Sony's thinking.

44
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I just might.

45
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:22,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Sony's basically going off about

46
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:23,019
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

47
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:49,229
[SPEAKER_05]: When they brought it out in Europe, basically trying to push it as a computer and not as a game console, they were saying that basically importing game consoles into the European Union is a huge tax drain where computers are not.

48
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So they wanted to get out of paying the taxes that they actually released Linux for the PS2.

49
00:03:56,852 --> 00:04:04,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, the theory is that they're trying to do that again and we might even see Linux for the PS3.

50
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:05,565
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

51
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:25,913
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on, let's move over to the Nintendo Wii.

53
00:05:00,273 --> 00:05:02,635
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some more news on the Virtual Console this week, right, Loki?

54
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:03,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's correct.

55
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:20,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata, he announced, or basically outlined the price ranges of some of the games that are going to be on the Virtual Console for lease and download in Japan.

56
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:24,270
[SPEAKER_08]: He says they're going to be anywhere between 500 yen and 1,000 yen, and basically that

57
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:29,867
[SPEAKER_08]: is the equivalent of about $4.50 to $8.99 in the US.

58
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:32,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that won't translate exactly, though.

59
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:36,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say $5 and $10, basically, to be competitive with Xbox Live.

60
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe $4 and $8.

61
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,671
[SPEAKER_10]: They might try to undercut Xbox Live a little bit, who knows?

62
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:47,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do the old $0.99 for $4.99 and $9.99 and all that stuff.

63
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:53,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't see, with some of these games, even their first party games or whatever, they could really do $0.99.

64
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:53,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean,

65
00:05:56,107 --> 00:06:05,751
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is, is the Nintendo console, if you put the virtual console with, like, thousands of items on there... I believe what happened is that the story was slightly altered later or whatever.

66
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:11,294
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some clarification that came out that said that this is only in regards to new stuff.

67
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:16,816
[SPEAKER_10]: This does not address the way that they're going to price the old Nintendo Entertainment System games, the Super Nintendo games.

68
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,018
[SPEAKER_10]: This is only about new things developed for the virtual console.

69
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:21,279
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the price range they're looking at.

70
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, dude, if they do 99 cents per game...

71
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,761
[SPEAKER_08]: That's gonna be one sweet deal

72
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,619
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see, I suppose.

73
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:55,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Or like as an added incentive to say maybe Super Mario Galaxy bundle in the retro Mario games with that too.

74
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario, Super Mario Brothers 2, um,

75
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:00,632
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on and so forth.

76
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:30,544
[SPEAKER_10]: DS software can be expanded using the Wii.

77
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:35,326
[SPEAKER_10]: The DS can access DS station services via the Wii.

78
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:42,629
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were kind of thinking that that might be one feature that you could download DS demos using your Wii, and I think that's a kick-butt idea.

79
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:43,509
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very smart.

80
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:49,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Nintendo's got some really interesting stuff in store, so we'll just have to see how it all works.

81
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Because sometimes things look good on paper.

82
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:53,369
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

83
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:17,951
[SPEAKER_05]: systems.

84
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:18,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

85
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:33,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, at least the stuff that they had, I mean, granted, it may not have been the best stuff for the system, but it was still pretty cool to play some NES games on the Game Boy Advance when you had Animal Crossing or, you know, using it in Crystal Chronicles, stuff like that.

86
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:44,138
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that they are mentioning, though, is that the release date is going to be announced before September.

87
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:45,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

88
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, that's interesting.

89
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:49,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll have to wait and see.

90
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder why they're waiting so long.

91
00:08:51,776 --> 00:09:01,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they, maybe they still, I'm starting to theorize, maybe, even though we've had all this speculation that we think October 18th's the date and everything, maybe Nintendo really still doesn't know what date they're gonna do.

92
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:06,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're waiting until they're absolutely certain they can hit it, and then they'll reveal it.

93
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:06,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

94
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:09,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just starting to wildly speculate here.

95
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:09,940
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

96
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:13,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they feel they don't need this three-month hype going into it.

97
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:15,846
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have the hype coming off E3.

98
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:18,687
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't really need to announce, oh, it's coming out.

99
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:20,887
[SPEAKER_10]: They could do it six weeks in advance and still get away with it.

100
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:22,048
[SPEAKER_10]: So who knows?

101
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Because let's say they announce the date in early September and the October 18th date turns out to be true.

102
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:28,089
[SPEAKER_10]: That would only be like six weeks.

103
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:29,630
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's enough time.

104
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,930
[SPEAKER_10]: They can do it.

105
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:32,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting.

106
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:34,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

107
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:34,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Also...

108
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:39,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo has lots in store for the DS for the rest of the year.

109
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:45,740
[SPEAKER_10]: DS, by the way, has shipped 8.43 million units in Japan in just 18 months.

110
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,381
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty interesting.

111
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:54,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, on July 20th, the company's going to release Shabiru DS o Ryori Navi.

112
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,708
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a cooking program for the DS.

113
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:02,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on October, the company's going to release Nihon... I'm going to butcher these names so bad, I apologize.

114
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:04,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh, that's a huge name.

115
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:05,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically...

116
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:06,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.

117
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:07,683
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to read that whole thing?

118
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see.

119
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:10,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

120
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:10,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

121
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:10,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's more?

122
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:13,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

123
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:15,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Training DS.

124
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:32,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, that is just common knowledge.

125
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,730
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a brain training game called Common Knowledge.

126
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,857
[SPEAKER_10]: They plan on releasing three to four Touch Generation Series titles per year.

127
00:10:41,217 --> 00:10:47,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, those are the games that are designed, like the brain training games and things that are really designed for the adult audience as well as kids.

128
00:10:48,976 --> 00:11:00,724
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying hardcore gamers will not be left out, but there was no mention of really any new games, but Iwata did mention that Final Fantasy 3 and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are on their way.

129
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:05,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy 3 is set for an August 24th release, but again, that's Japan, but I imagine the U.S.

130
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:06,607
[SPEAKER_10]: won't be far behind.

131
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:07,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of Pokemon, Loki.

132
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:13,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Pokemon Battle Revolution, and I'm not a huge Pokemon fan, but

133
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:19,324
[SPEAKER_08]: What's interesting about this is the fact that the graphics look a lot better than what we saw at E3 on the Wii.

134
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And that I thought was quite interesting.

135
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:37,549
[SPEAKER_08]: The game actually, though, looks like it's going to tie in with the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of the new Pokemon games, as well as it's supposed to use the DS as a microphone for the game as well.

136
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,010
[SPEAKER_08]: What looks interesting, though, they actually have video up from it.

137
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like Final Fantasy X battles.

138
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:48,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, basically, just really hardcore battles.

139
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:55,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And the graphics look pretty good, and I'm not sure if you've seen the picture yet, but, I mean, that looks pretty damn good for a

140
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:57,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

141
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:15,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And this game is supposed to launch in 2006.

142
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

143
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's kind of early then.

144
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:22,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the Wii is capable of even more and more and more.

145
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,470
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

146
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

147
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,010
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

148
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one interesting game that may be on its way out soon, DarkSakura, you have some news on this.

149
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:39,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Zelda spin-off for the DS called Mogitate Tinglebara Irui Rupeeland, which translates to Fresh Tingles Rose-Colored Rupeeland.

150
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Fresh Tingles.

151
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:51,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Tingle was in Wind Waker and Majora's Mask and also I might mention that Tingle actually really translates over to Tinkle they just changed it because that would be really bad

152
00:12:53,248 --> 00:13:01,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you are basically carted around by this person named Rupe... I guess it's Rupeji.

153
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:02,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to be Old Man Rupe.

154
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:07,154
[SPEAKER_05]: It basically tells you to... Maybe Rupeji, I guess.

155
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:09,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's written like it'd be Rupeji, but anyway.

156
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:18,119
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to basically collect rupees and throw them in a magic spring so you go to Rupeeland and you turn into Tingle.

157
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:25,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So you also get help from a fairy named Pingle who talks to you by a TV in your house.

158
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to pay people and keep them happy and go through toll gates.

159
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Tingle and Pingle.

160
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,620
[SPEAKER_10]: This sounds like Teletubby's The Game.

161
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Also another title that's coming up for DS is Kaito Wario 7.

162
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:40,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

163
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:41,062
[SPEAKER_05]: WarioWare.

164
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:42,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

165
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:42,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

166
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:49,750
[SPEAKER_05]: by the studio that brought us F-Zero Climax on the GBA and Rhythmic Star on Itoy.

167
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,031
[SPEAKER_10]: F-Zero Climax.

168
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:53,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, F-Zero will make you.

169
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to win.

170
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:54,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to win.

171
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:55,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

172
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:56,976
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

173
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

174
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:01,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, let's get into some political-oriented news.

175
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:02,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

176
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

177
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:13,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Hillary Clinton opened her big fat mouth, and she basically said that the federal government needs to step in to ensure that electronic media, including video games, isn't harming children's development.

178
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:29,807
[SPEAKER_08]: and what she's basically suggesting is that they approve a federal funded research program into the effects or broad effects of media from everything from television to video games to the internet on children.

179
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:41,871
[SPEAKER_08]: What she needs to research is a way that parents do their fucking job and she also needs a researcher goddamn new platform to be, you know, bitching about.

180
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:43,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like it.

181
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:54,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting quote there.

182
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Parents do not need goddamn help.

183
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, I want to point this out too.

184
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:05,891
[SPEAKER_10]: This statement, by the way, came just like hours before the House of Representatives made that indecency fine increase.

185
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:06,311
[SPEAKER_10]: $32,500 up to $325,000.

186
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,511
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a 379 to 35 vote in the House.

187
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:07,991
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

188
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:10,812
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the place of our government to be sticking their nose into how parents do their job.

189
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:11,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Parents need to actually...

190
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Be the ones to do their job.

191
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're not ready to do that job, don't have the children.

192
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,881
[SPEAKER_08]: We mean they don't understand how to do their job.

193
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:39,583
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a goddamn reading system that tells them what is appropriate for what age, what kind of content is in said product, and there's also parental controls on your console systems.

194
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:44,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how much more do I need to go over there and wipe their ass for them too?

195
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:49,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's apparently, oh, I'm so helpless, I can't possibly monitor what my kid sees.

196
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,566
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's reading systems and everything.

197
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,298
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been done.

198
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:55,359
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the parents are too goddamn lazy to do this.

199
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when something bad happens, Oh my god, I didn't know!

200
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:00,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know!

201
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna sue for lots of money now!

202
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:04,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, that's basically what it comes down to.

203
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,266
[SPEAKER_08]: The parents are retarded, and then they get paid for being retarded.

204
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, America!

205
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Rewarding the retarded!

206
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:14,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

207
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of people not... This just keeps going.

208
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of people not doing their jobs...

209
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:24,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, guess what, uh, one of the, uh, judges in the John A. Gotti Jr.

210
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,731
[SPEAKER_05]: trial was doing.

211
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I already know the answer, but I'll act surprised.

212
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:32,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, basically, uh, he was playing solitaire.

213
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:34,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

214
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:34,696
[SPEAKER_05]: In the trial.

215
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:35,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't it a she?

216
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:38,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was, uh, I'm trying to find the name.

217
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Shira, uh, Scheindlin.

218
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:41,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

219
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:45,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was, uh, playing, uh, solitaire during the trial.

220
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:46,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

221
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:48,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, basically, while, um...

222
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see who the name was.

223
00:16:54,257 --> 00:17:03,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Curtis Stilwell, one of the Guardian Angels from one of the anti-crime groups, basically, was testifying and the judge was playing solitaire.

224
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:05,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

225
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And I never...

226
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:13,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Until I had jury duty, I always thought the judge just kind of sat there and just kind of watched everything going on.

227
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:17,378
[SPEAKER_10]: But the judge really is doing other stuff while people are there testifying.

228
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:25,642
[SPEAKER_10]: When one of the lawyers yells objection, that's when the judge kind of looks over and will look at the last few things said and then make a ruling.

229
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:30,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, the judge, I don't know if he's doing emails or looking up law things on the internet or maybe playing solitaire.

230
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:30,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

231
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:31,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I doubt he is.

232
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,506
[SPEAKER_10]: He seems like a really smart guy.

233
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:33,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor no.

234
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:34,547
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting.

235
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,349
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting what the judges could possibly get away with.

236
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,272
[SPEAKER_10]: If I hadn't done jury duty this week, I would have never imagined that this could be humanly possible.

237
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:47,295
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an interesting quote here from Scylla, basically comparing...

238
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:53,165
[SPEAKER_05]: The New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg firing a city worker for playing solitaire at the desk.

239
00:17:53,706 --> 00:18:00,690
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote, Should a federal judge be playing video solitaire when an employee of the New York City government gets fired for playing video solitaire?

240
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think any of us are that good at multitasking.

241
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:05,053
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it's an abuse and an outrage.

242
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:11,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, you know, there's a type... I'm going to point out something.

243
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:12,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone is aware of this.

244
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:15,941
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a type of learning called kinesthetic learning.

245
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:21,936
[SPEAKER_05]: What this means is that you learn better while you were doing other things, when you have something else pulling your attention.

246
00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:33,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we did this at work, we did a study on this at work, where we were given toys, like Legos and stuff, to do while we were at one of our training classes.

247
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:37,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And at least half of the class actually retained the knowledge in our training class better.

248
00:18:38,360 --> 00:19:00,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, a lot of times when, you know, I have to listen to something, I'm doodling, I doodle in class, you know, people, some people learn, or actually I would say pay attention better when they've got something else going on, something that is, you know, when they keep one, I guess, one of their senses occupied, be it, you know, in playing solitaire.

249
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:03,046
[SPEAKER_05]: That, you know, they'll be able to better listen.

250
00:19:03,086 --> 00:19:04,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there are people that are just like that.

251
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:12,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, you know, I would rather have a judge that's good at multitasking than having someone that can only focus on one thing at one time.

252
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:19,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, it's also proven that people who play video games are better, have a better understanding for complex situations.

253
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It almost sounds like you're okay with her playing solitaire.

254
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:22,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am okay with it.

255
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:23,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

256
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.

257
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:24,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

258
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:24,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

259
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:25,895
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just cards.

261
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:51,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that you have a game on a computer with cards, that's solitaire as retarded.

262
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Solitaire is so last century.

263
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to read the comments in our chat room.

264
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,493
[SPEAKER_10]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

265
00:19:58,193 --> 00:20:01,214
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, they should be playing Phoenix Wright.

266
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:03,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, making the obvious joke there.

267
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Blaze says, the judge does not watch porn, Loki.

268
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:11,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Judges are heavily involved and can actually swing a trial for or against the prosecution defense.

269
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, moving right along.

270
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:19,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you have some more political-oriented news.

271
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:21,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, as if this is a big surprise.

272
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:22,657
[SPEAKER_08]: ESA is going to sue Minnesota.

273
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:23,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And why are they suing them?

274
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:32,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, because of the recent law that they passed that would fine kids $25 for buying or renting M or adult-rated games.

275
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:36,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, they said that,

276
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: This is definitely costing taxpayers a lot of money for a law that they can't really enforce in the first place.

277
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:57,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, and I quote, The bill's tortured effort to end the run of the First Amendment by punishing kids directly fails under the Constitution because children have rights under the First Amendment like all other citizens.

278
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:04,840
[SPEAKER_08]: The state is attempting to impose liability on children because they know that the courts have constantly held

279
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:12,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We believe that the courts will agree that fighting children violates the First Amendment as well.

280
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:24,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And if this law is implemented, it will not only limit the First Amendment rights for Minnesota residents, it will create a huge amount of confusion for retailers, parents, and children.

281
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:24,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm confident...

282
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:31,550
[SPEAKER_08]: That the court will affirm our position given the ruling on similar statutes in other jurisdictions.

283
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's my problem with the whole thing is why the hell did this law get passed in the first place?

284
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:40,213
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have similar laws for R-rated movies or NC-17 movies.

285
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,834
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine for kids to see that stuff.

286
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's more lifelike than games.

287
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the hell?

288
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:47,696
[SPEAKER_08]: This is stupid.

289
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really stupid and it will probably get overturned anyway.

290
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:52,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever.

291
00:21:54,966 --> 00:22:08,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to another state and their political news, Louisiana, the Senate has unanimously passed a bill that had a lot of involvement by he who shall not be named on this program anymore, the Media Horn.

292
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,226
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't know who we're talking about, his name rhymes with Mr. Fuck-Ompson.

293
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:15,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Jackass.

294
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:19,237
[SPEAKER_10]: The Measure was written by Representative Roy Burrell.

295
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:36,934
[SPEAKER_10]: and he was just a co-author on it.

296
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:44,377
[SPEAKER_10]: It's HB 1381 and it makes it illegal to sell, rent, or lease a game to a minor if it meets three conditions.

297
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:56,043
[SPEAKER_10]: If the average person would think appeals to the minor's morbid interest in violence or if it depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to prevailing standards

298
00:22:56,604 --> 00:23:03,434
[SPEAKER_10]: and the game also qualifies if it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

299
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:08,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Violators could be fined between $102,000 and sentenced up to 12 months in a state prison.

300
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,164
[SPEAKER_10]: What a bunch of horse shit.

301
00:23:10,344 --> 00:23:10,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

302
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:12,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the checks here?

303
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:16,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate these vague, vague laws that people are coming up with.

304
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:25,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Who determines if a game lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors?

305
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:30,336
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the government's job to rate art.

306
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:38,782
[SPEAKER_05]: That same description there, it actually does go into a free speech right, because that actually is one of the defining rights for what allows free speech and what doesn't.

307
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:52,885
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basically trying to manipulate the Constitution into applying it toward video games instead of saying, oh, well, you're denying us our free speech right, trying to make it fall under what's allowable free speech.

308
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

309
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:55,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me look up the First Amendment.

310
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,915
[SPEAKER_10]: No, actually, I want to hear this First Amendment passage here.

311
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:05,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll read some more here.

312
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:29,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Governor of Louisiana, and of course the governor is expected to sign the bill because of the unanimous vote and the recent linking of games and teenage murder suspects in the Louisiana media.

313
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:35,245
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course you can expect that the ESA will have a problem with this and file a lawsuit immediately.

314
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:36,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Any luck?

315
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:45,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm trying to find it because basically it's a matter of court interpretation because we went over this in my law class, some of my law classes that I've taken.

316
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:54,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, basically, just looking through this, we've been dealing with this since the country was created.

317
00:24:55,631 --> 00:25:00,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking on here, there's also a note on here that basically...

318
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:07,459
[SPEAKER_05]: They can punish words that by their very nature invoke danger to the public peace and to the security of the state.

319
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:10,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the things listed.

320
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is on Wikipedia.

321
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the exact text right here.

322
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:31,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

323
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:42,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to, there was, there were a number of cases though where they brought that in under, here it is, obscenity.

324
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm quoting Wikipedia, basically.

325
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,921
[SPEAKER_05]: The federal government and the states have long permitted to restrict obscene and pornographic speech.

326
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:56,505
[SPEAKER_05]: While obscene speech generally has no protection under the First Amendment, pornography is subject to little regulation.

327
00:25:56,965 --> 00:26:00,488
[SPEAKER_05]: The exact definition of obscenity in pornography has changed over time.

328
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:05,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I really recommend that people go on Wikipedia and read this.

329
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:06,312
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of stuff here.

330
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:35,608
[SPEAKER_05]: but um they're basically saying in Miller vs. California 1973 a work is obscene if it and this is basically what's referred to as the Miller test which is where the basis of that law in Louisiana a work is obscene if it would be found appealing to the prurient interest by an average person applying contemporary community standards to pick sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and has no serious literary artistic and political or scientific value so basically they're taking

331
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:39,571
[SPEAKER_05]: What they've applied to movies and applying it to video games.

332
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take this even a step further than that.

333
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:44,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's punish people for not sharing.

334
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:52,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Because basically, right here, you're taking the parents' responsibility for deciding what their kids can see.

335
00:26:53,290 --> 00:27:01,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go ahead and have the government step in for their other jobs, like making sure that the kids share their toys with their brothers and sisters.

336
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:04,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we should find the kids that do not share their toys.

337
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should also basically...

338
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,521
[SPEAKER_08]: and Penny Arcade as we mentioned before.

339
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,322
[SPEAKER_08]: is working on ads for the ESRB.

340
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:38,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of these were actually kind of shown a little bit at E3, and they've actually unveiled a couple of them so far.

341
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And they look pretty good.

342
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:41,969
[SPEAKER_08]: They've just got a character with text written around the outside.

343
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:49,355
[SPEAKER_08]: And, for example, I'm going to pull up one here for Sarah, one of the ones advertising the E rating.

344
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:56,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, because Sarah plays video games, there is a group of people making sure that the games she plays are rated.

345
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:59,834
[SPEAKER_08]: They're called the Entertainment Software Ratings Board.

346
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:02,855
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just the long way of saying it.

347
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:06,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually it's called the ESRB.

348
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:15,618
[SPEAKER_08]: They check games to help make sure... It's hard to read this.

349
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:17,639
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to read because it goes around the corner.

350
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:18,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

351
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,519
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be something in the app.

352
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:23,841
[SPEAKER_08]: To make sure it's right for you, your older brother, mom and dad, anybody.

353
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody's got to do it.

354
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,126
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're the ones that do.

355
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,909
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's basically an ad saying, you know what, this is being done.

356
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,031
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same thing is being done with film.

357
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:37,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand, okay, they've done it in the past.

358
00:28:37,353 --> 00:28:41,156
[SPEAKER_08]: They've, you know, gone after movies and stuff.

359
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:43,858
[SPEAKER_08]: But still though, it's the same thing.

360
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:44,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's media.

361
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because it's interactive, big deal.

362
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:52,044
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, big deal if it's interactive, but it doesn't, it's still the same thing.

363
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:54,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can go watch, you know, a kung fu movie and when I

364
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:57,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Kick the crap out of people afterwards.

365
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,374
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same damn thing.

366
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:01,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know why they're not attacking all media at the same time.

367
00:29:02,456 --> 00:29:02,856
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

368
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:04,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

369
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:07,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of promotion, the ESRB trying to promote their rating system there.

370
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,980
[SPEAKER_10]: We like to promote good websites on this program, don't we, DarkSakura?

371
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure do.

372
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,421
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura is the queen of the Internet.

373
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:20,604
[SPEAKER_10]: She surfs the Internet up and down and finds a website that she would like to share with you guys in her website of the week.

374
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:22,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be going this week?

375
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:32,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I talked about them last week because I'd had a really good experience actually doing business with the business side of the site.

376
00:29:32,694 --> 00:29:35,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to actually promote the forums at Junkiespot.com.

377
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:38,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It's J-U-N-K-Y spot dot com.

378
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:46,069
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who's basically getting into, like I've been getting into the Dolphies, the model doll where you customize everything.

379
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:51,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I found more information on their forums than I have anywhere else in the entirety of the internet.

380
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,531
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of that, it's a good place for communication for anybody who's into that.

381
00:29:57,592 --> 00:29:59,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had nothing but a good experience there.

382
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:00,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's friendly.

383
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:06,618
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I haven't even seen... It's the only forum I've ever been to that I haven't seen any flaming at all on.

384
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:08,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there going to be anything for me if I'm not into dollies?

385
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:09,600
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

386
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:10,181
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

387
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:13,143
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've talked to a few of our listeners who have gotten into it.

388
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:14,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

389
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:16,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figured, you know, this is my...

390
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:18,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Casting my side of the week is my side of the week.

391
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,064
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

392
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:26,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, though, there are actually some good painting tips, though.

393
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:30,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of these, my husband was saying, yeah, that applies to model cars, too.

394
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:31,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, fair enough.

395
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:34,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm being girly, okay?

396
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:40,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you like to dress up your models in Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, maybe you want to dress up a dolly.

397
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:42,477
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people who have made...

398
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:50,747
[SPEAKER_05]: who have done basically cosplay Dolphies where they've actually made characters from different games.

399
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:51,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

400
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:52,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's pretty cool.

401
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that could be interesting.

402
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:57,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Dolls based off of the characters.

403
00:30:57,374 --> 00:30:59,857
[SPEAKER_10]: People would make those and sell them for tons of money at conventions.

404
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:01,999
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually buy, though, pre-done...

405
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:30,332
[SPEAKER_05]: they're made by different companies but like they've actually started releasing I think they're the the cool girls line I'm trying to remember I think it's Takara that puts it out they have a cutie honey and they have Kusanagi whatever her name is from Ghost in the Shell they have a doll for that and a lot of different places but it's kind of a weird little niche thing it's a hobby I picked up while I was you know out of work but it's

406
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:32,570
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good informative place.

407
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:33,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

408
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:39,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back into some gaming news, Loki, some news in the Street Fighter world?

409
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:41,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and it's interesting.

410
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:53,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of a rumor at the point right now, but it says according to a website, snk-capcom.com, a DC vs. Street Fighter game may be indeed in the works.

411
00:31:53,705 --> 00:32:00,890
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've confirmed with both parties at this year's E3 that the legalities of the game were being considered

412
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:27,002
[SPEAKER_08]: and um it'd be pretty interesting if they came out with that now you might remember they used to do like a Marvel versus Capcom and Marvel versus Street Fighter so DC versus Street Fighter would be kind of cool although I think Superman would kick everyone's ass in that so I don't know be interesting to see Superman versus like uh Chung Li I think he's gonna beat her ass we'll see just a little bit there she might have kryptonite panties on you never know oh okay all right uh

413
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this is very interesting.

414
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:38,263
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a Final Fantasy fan, certainly you're anticipating Final Fantasy XIII, and this is why the PlayStation 3 is still cool for some people, because Final Fantasy XIII looks to be pretty ass-kicking.

415
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:42,506
[SPEAKER_10]: And Advent Children actually is inspiring Final Fantasy XIII somewhat.

416
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:53,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Not maybe directly, but, you know, while the DVD kind of got some mixed reviews from people, it had some great kick-butt battle sequences in the movie, like some really fast-paced things.

417
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you guys have probably seen this in the trailer.

418
00:32:55,214 --> 00:33:06,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is interesting because Final Fantasy XIII's director, Motomo Toriyama said, Final Fantasy XIII attempts to see how far it's possible to make Final Fantasy VII Advent Children's battles into a game.

419
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:12,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is a video production, and it showed us battles that have not been achievable in Final Fantasy so far.

420
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:17,241
[SPEAKER_10]: With Final Fantasy XIII, we're focusing on how far we can realize the video.

421
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:19,922
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might be a pretty sweet game.

422
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:22,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine you're getting to control some of those battle sequences.

423
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:25,144
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll sell some PlayStation 3s.

424
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:27,405
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll get the Sony family back.

425
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:28,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That game ain't coming out until next year.

426
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:30,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Way late next year.

427
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:31,587
[SPEAKER_10]: If even that.

428
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:32,647
[SPEAKER_10]: And that'll be in Japan.

429
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:35,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how long did Final Fantasy XII take to come out?

430
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:35,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

431
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:37,009
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's still not out here.

432
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:37,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

433
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say, I don't even think we're going to get it next year.

434
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say we will have Final Fantasy XIII Christmas 2008.

435
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:45,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I would anticipate.

436
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:46,653
[SPEAKER_10]: But what do I know?

437
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:47,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just some guy on the internet.

438
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:51,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you have some news regarding online games.

439
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:54,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, actually, the online game market is huge.

440
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:55,156
[SPEAKER_08]: How huge?

441
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:59,300
[SPEAKER_08]: They're estimating it's going to reach $13 billion by the year 2011.

442
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:09,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, this is a lot in part for games such as World of Warcraft and EverQuest and whatnot.

443
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:13,833
[SPEAKER_08]: But just basically, even nowadays, you see tons of MMOs coming around.

444
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:17,026
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just the way everything's kind of headed nowadays.

445
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:23,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And even like Xbox Live Arcade and a lot of the online games, everything's really just heading online.

446
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:26,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's no wonder that it's going to be that big.

447
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:30,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wouldn't be surprised if it hits $13 billion even sooner than that.

448
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:33,859
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of being safe.

449
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:39,984
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes to big, it doesn't get much bigger than World of Warcraft.

450
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:43,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know there was a story we talked about on this program, probably like

451
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:44,556
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

452
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:21,699
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically the companies agreed to withdraw their previous takedown notices and drop all the infringement claims and also it was said that they'd refrain from filing any future takedown notices against the same items COP has already disputed through counter notices.

453
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:32,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And COP, by the way, will be retaining the book's disclaimers about its unofficial nature and he won't include links or instructions on how to locate cheats in the game.

454
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:35,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's strictly a strategy guide without endorsing cheating.

455
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,028
[SPEAKER_10]: So a little bit of

456
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:37,368
[SPEAKER_10]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

457
00:35:52,946 --> 00:35:54,608
[SPEAKER_10]: or you can give us a phone call as well.

458
00:35:54,688 --> 00:36:06,737
[SPEAKER_10]: The phone number is 916-226-9067 but please keep in mind that that is a toll call for most people so please if you don't own the phone line or pay the bills, please ask somebody before you give us a call.

459
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:10,479
[SPEAKER_10]: And we already have a phone call coming in so I'm going to go ahead and pick that up.

460
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

461
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:15,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Sky, it's me, Raven's Dolphin.

462
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:17,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Raven's Dolphin, what's on your mind?

463
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:20,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I just picked up the DS Lite.

464
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:22,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes, the DS Lites are out today.

465
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:23,309
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

466
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:24,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

467
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

468
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:26,991
[SPEAKER_10]: What's so great about it?

469
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:29,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I'm totally sold on the DS Lite yet.

470
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:34,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me why I need to get this when I already have the DS, you know, fat.

471
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:35,437
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

472
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:36,438
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

473
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for one reason.

474
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,180
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing has brighter screens.

475
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:48,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying this just because when I turned this thing on, I noticed a big difference from the original.

476
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:54,448
[SPEAKER_10]: There's colors I haven't seen before.

477
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:14,155
[SPEAKER_10]: It sure is.

478
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:15,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else to call it.

479
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,157
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the DS... DS Heavy.

480
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:18,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the DS Fat.

481
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:19,659
[SPEAKER_10]: The DS Fatty.

482
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Crappy.

483
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:23,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not crappy.

484
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:24,804
[SPEAKER_10]: DS is a good system.

485
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:26,145
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a little fat.

486
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:27,946
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the light better.

487
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:28,607
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

488
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:30,308
[SPEAKER_02]: What about now?

489
00:37:30,328 --> 00:37:32,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's somebody in our chat room here.

490
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,873
[SPEAKER_10]: VXJSNXV says, Brider is totally unnecessary.

491
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:37,434
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you say to that?

492
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:39,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't say much.

493
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:42,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Ari Mawson says, I got my DS Lite today.

494
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:43,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its death brightness setting.

495
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:45,672
[SPEAKER_10]: The red is more redder now.

496
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I like fourth is death.

497
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:49,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

498
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:50,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, can I say something?

499
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

500
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:55,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I stand in line for three minutes for a DS Lite.

501
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:57,506
[SPEAKER_02]: No one was at my ebb store.

502
00:37:57,886 --> 00:37:58,286
[SPEAKER_10]: EB.

503
00:37:58,747 --> 00:38:01,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there hasn't been a whole lot of promotion leading up to launch day.

504
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:05,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's something Nintendo just kind of wants out there and is going to be circulating.

505
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:10,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there was really a huge push for a stellar launch for this.

506
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but in Japan, people have been waiting in line for days to get a DS.

507
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's because everybody else has imported one.

508
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:22,521
[SPEAKER_10]: They stand in line for Dragon Quest, too, yet here nobody cares, although they should.

509
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:27,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but they at least Dragon Quest on a Sunday or a Saturday.

510
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:28,703
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

511
00:38:29,363 --> 00:38:31,243
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

512
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:35,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't support Sony.

513
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll see.

514
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:38,585
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

515
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Things can change.

516
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:46,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize the world is anti-Sony right now, but devil's advocate, you guys, Sony might say something that's going to win you back.

517
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:48,783
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we'll see.

518
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:50,484
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Raven's Dolphin, have a good one.

519
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:51,624
[SPEAKER_10]: You too, bye.

520
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:52,604
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, see you later.

521
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:53,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for the call.

522
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to another phone call.

523
00:38:55,205 --> 00:38:56,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

524
00:38:56,746 --> 00:38:57,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

525
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:00,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, who's this?

526
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:06,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're sounding a little distorted there.

527
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe pull the microphone back just a little bit.

528
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:09,445
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

529
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:10,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.

530
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:11,267
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

531
00:39:12,347 --> 00:39:16,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to go on a rant, if you don't mind.

532
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:17,732
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to what?

533
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:19,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on a rant.

534
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:21,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, go ahead and rant for a little bit.

535
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:25,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Put the microphone a little bit closer, but not as close as it was before, and then rant.

536
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I hate Final Fantasy.

537
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

538
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:39,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I have played it, I do not like it, I respect people who like it, but I do not like it.

539
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:40,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, which one or all of them?

540
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:48,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have played all the big ones, Final Fantasy 7, 10, all those, and I do not like it.

541
00:39:48,582 --> 00:39:49,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So you haven't played any of the classics?

542
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:53,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I just find it boring and a little just kind of weird and not too original.

543
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:09,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

544
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:35,555
[SPEAKER_10]: and, you know, I realize why sports games are out there, and there's some pretty good sports games out there if you're into those types of games, but for me, I don't really play sports games.

545
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:36,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't enjoy them.

546
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:38,898
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just kind of the type of game I'm not into.

547
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:45,802
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm cool with you not liking Final Fantasy as long as, you know, you still have respect for people that are into it, because I respect people that play sports titles.

548
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:53,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, and I thank you for respecting it, but I've had many people say, you suck, you suck!

549
00:40:54,148 --> 00:40:54,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just...

550
00:40:56,926 --> 00:41:00,048
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, instead of this, okay, instead of this, try a different approach.

551
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:06,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, next time, knock it on Final Fantasy, tell your friends about the games you do like and make them play those games.

552
00:41:07,013 --> 00:41:07,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

553
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:08,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Less hate, more love.

554
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:08,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it?

555
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:14,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, as you may have noticed, I tried it before I judged.

556
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:16,098
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, that's good.

557
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:17,359
[SPEAKER_01]: That I can respect.

558
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:21,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like one Mac hater that I will not mention.

559
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:22,442
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right.

560
00:41:23,203 --> 00:41:24,304
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to let you go, buddy.

561
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:26,265
[SPEAKER_10]: We got more calls coming in, but thanks for the call, okay?

562
00:41:27,623 --> 00:41:28,043
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, later.

563
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:32,146
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's take another call here.

564
00:41:32,686 --> 00:41:33,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

565
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:34,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

566
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:38,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, this is the AmpliDude.

567
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

568
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:40,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, AmpliDude.

569
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:41,532
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

570
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:43,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Just calling in.

571
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:46,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get to listen to much of the show besides the past 10 minutes.

572
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:50,797
[SPEAKER_07]: But as the last caller, Final Fantasy...

573
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:53,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy V is more of a good thing.

574
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:20,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Amplitude Amplitude

575
00:42:51,342 --> 00:42:53,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much all RPGs.

576
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:55,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just playing Beatmania not too long ago before I called.

577
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,327
[SPEAKER_10]: US one or Japanese one?

578
00:42:58,788 --> 00:42:59,649
[SPEAKER_07]: 7th Japanese.

579
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:01,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's one of the styles I don't own.

580
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:04,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I took a break from Beatmania for a little while.

581
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:04,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I skipped that one.

582
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:06,154
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't.

583
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I have 7th style.

584
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:08,435
[SPEAKER_10]: 7th has some of my favorite music in it.

585
00:43:08,475 --> 00:43:09,276
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have 7th style.

586
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:10,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get 9th and up.

587
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:12,518
[SPEAKER_10]: I might need to borrow some of those from you at some point.

588
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:13,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I miss a whole bunch.

589
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:14,740
[SPEAKER_05]: If I ever get mine back from George.

590
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:15,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

591
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:15,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

592
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:17,675
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

593
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:18,655
[SPEAKER_10]: B-Media is a good time.

594
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:19,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played Red yet?

595
00:43:20,216 --> 00:43:20,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

596
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:26,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually left it at home, so I had to deal with 7, but 11 is awesome.

597
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:28,459
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful setup.

598
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to play more of it.

599
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:30,200
[SPEAKER_10]: I absolutely do.

600
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other thoughts for our listeners, Amplitude?

601
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:38,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my friend's girlfriend brought over her DS Lite today.

602
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty kick-ass, I have to say.

603
00:43:40,904 --> 00:43:42,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Are the Reds indeed redder?

604
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:43,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

605
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot brighter.

606
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:50,153
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels a lot different than I would have expected.

607
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:52,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I expected it to feel a lot different than it did.

608
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:55,736
[SPEAKER_10]: But is it worth $129?

609
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:58,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it worth that much money?

610
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:05,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since I've had mine since it came out, it kind of turned shitty, so I need to get myself a new one.

611
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:06,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

612
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:07,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still on the fence with it.

613
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if I have extra money after my vacation coming up.

614
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:10,226
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

615
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:14,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Amplitude, thanks so much for the call, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, okay?

616
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:16,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, cool.

617
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:16,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, buddy.

618
00:44:16,663 --> 00:44:17,643
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

619
00:44:17,803 --> 00:44:18,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

620
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:21,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to at least one more call, maybe two.

621
00:44:22,905 --> 00:44:23,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to this one.

622
00:44:23,485 --> 00:44:24,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

623
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

624
00:44:26,326 --> 00:44:26,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, who's this?

625
00:44:27,827 --> 00:44:29,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Nintendo Maniac 64.

626
00:44:29,327 --> 00:44:30,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.

627
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:31,808
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy?

628
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:36,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, first off, uh, what is his name, like, Gizem or Gizem or something.

629
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,310
[SPEAKER_11]: He really wanted me to call in.

630
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:40,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, what do you want to call in about?

631
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, first off, you can say about the DS Lite and stuff.

632
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:51,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, I was up in New York and stuff, and at Nintendo World, I actually saw them installing the DS Lite demo stations, which was kind of cool.

633
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:53,772
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

634
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:55,893
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the Nintendo store like?

635
00:44:55,913 --> 00:44:56,774
[SPEAKER_10]: You went there for the launch?

636
00:44:57,854 --> 00:45:01,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no, I was just up there in New York for this art show my sister was in.

637
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:04,377
[SPEAKER_11]: It was for, like, Scholastics and stuff.

638
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:08,379
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, because didn't you put out the call in the last episode of the show you wanted to meet fans or something?

639
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, um, nobody came, so, like,

640
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,430
[SPEAKER_11]: There's my SU for the week.

641
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll come next time, if I have money.

642
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,513
[SPEAKER_10]: So did you get to actually play the DS Lite when you were there?

643
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:27,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I did, but, like, I mean, sure, it was brighter and stuff, but, okay, whoop-de-doo.

644
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:29,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't that great to me.

645
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:31,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, so a little bit of a diss.

646
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:32,718
[SPEAKER_10]: The red's not so red.

647
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's real red.

648
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:40,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like, I just didn't care too much, and I got to phone some people at DDR Mario Mix,

649
00:45:41,266 --> 00:45:45,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played Mario Mix since E3 last year, so... But I don't want to void my warranty!

650
00:45:45,848 --> 00:45:47,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of our warranties are already passed.

651
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fair enough.

652
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we have talked about that hack on previous episodes of the show.

653
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:13,202
[SPEAKER_11]: And just one last question.

654
00:46:13,262 --> 00:46:13,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

655
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:15,743
[SPEAKER_11]: For any DS lighters out there who have them.

656
00:46:17,104 --> 00:46:24,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Does any guys know if the DS light battery is the exact same shape and stuff as a regular DS battery?

657
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:27,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the DS battery stuff.

658
00:46:28,408 --> 00:46:29,849
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, because we don't own one.

659
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:33,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine it's probably the same charger, but I'll let someone in the chat answer that.

660
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,761
[SPEAKER_11]: My old charger's probably the same.

661
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:38,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm saying that, like, you know how, like, battery life is, like, twice as long and stuff?

662
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:44,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just wondering if you could, like, somehow get the battery out of the new one, but in your old DS, what, you get, like, 40 hours or something?

663
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:45,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

664
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:45,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

665
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:04,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see there, and Sakurina's agreeing.

666
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:06,538
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what the chatroom says, and I'll fill you in.

667
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:06,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

668
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're going to let you go, buddy.

669
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:09,599
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try and take one more call, alright?

670
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:12,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, apparently my DSL just dropped out on me for a second.

671
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Ouch.

672
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can always download the podcast.

673
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,502
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, it reconnects.

674
00:47:17,562 --> 00:47:18,662
[SPEAKER_11]: It just does a standpoint.

675
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:19,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

676
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:21,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, buddy.

677
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:22,184
[SPEAKER_11]: See ya.

678
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:22,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

679
00:47:22,524 --> 00:47:22,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

680
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:30,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone in chat room pointing out there that the battery life is, of course, shorter if you use the four times the brightness there.

681
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So the higher the brightness, the shorter the battery life, obviously.

682
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:35,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing on most laptops, et cetera.

683
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:38,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Skype line is open.

684
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw somebody else trying to call in there, but you have a chance now if you want to get in there.

685
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:45,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Our Skype line's name is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

686
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:49,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can call us on the regular telephone as well, 916-226-9067.

687
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:50,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

688
00:47:50,888 --> 00:47:51,929
[SPEAKER_10]: One last call for tonight.

689
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:53,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

690
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:53,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

691
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, OLR.

692
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:56,222
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DMN.

693
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:56,742
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

694
00:47:56,802 --> 00:47:57,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, DMN.

695
00:47:58,004 --> 00:47:58,764
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

696
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:02,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to give an FU of the week to my own company.

697
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you work for Nintendo?

698
00:48:05,191 --> 00:48:05,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

699
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:06,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, what do they do?

700
00:48:08,575 --> 00:48:13,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a disturbing trend I've been seeing with the DS games since we've been on the subject of the DS Lite.

701
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:22,140
[SPEAKER_06]: With the games like Brain Training and Nintendogs, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but these games seem to have a shelf life of two weeks, and that's it, and people just toss them away.

702
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:29,863
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I agree, I regret, I think at E3 last year I said Nintendogs was like the runner-up for Game of Show, I totally regret that.

703
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:40,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it was fun for the hour I played at E3, or not even that, but it was fun for the time I played at E3, but when I actually got it home to play, it was, the thrill lasted a week, maybe two.

704
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I traded in my puppies yesterday.

705
00:48:43,491 --> 00:48:49,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfortunate because I've yet to see a DS game that's had a good replay value short of Mario Kart and Tetris.

706
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:54,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the online games which obviously give those games more replay value.

707
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:59,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stand Prime Hunters because first person shooters on a portable are just a bad idea.

708
00:49:00,293 --> 00:49:03,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hopefully, and we're echoing really bad, by the way.

709
00:49:03,596 --> 00:49:05,477
[SPEAKER_10]: You might want to back away from your speakers a little bit or turn it down.

710
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:10,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, there will be more online games in Nintendo's future.

711
00:49:10,621 --> 00:49:11,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Many, many more.

712
00:49:12,142 --> 00:49:12,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, definitely.

713
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:14,684
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

714
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:17,947
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's about it.

715
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:21,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to rant that, see what people thought.

716
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:27,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, I can get to my inside sources because I'm starting back up at Nintendo.

717
00:49:27,915 --> 00:49:29,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're starting Wii testing tomorrow.

718
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:32,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully I can get more info on that for you guys as well.

719
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:33,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, wait a minute.

720
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:39,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't you say that you were against, like on an earlier show, you were against the October date because the Wiis weren't in yet?

721
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's what I've been hearing.

722
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:46,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, so maybe it'll get interesting.

723
00:49:47,412 --> 00:49:48,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, maybe it will.

724
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:52,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And also Operation Get Reggie Phil's Aim on the show is now underway.

725
00:49:52,893 --> 00:49:53,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

726
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:59,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Please, I would love to make sweet love to Reggie through interview form on this program.

727
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:01,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be sure to wear protection during that show.

728
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:02,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I will.

729
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:05,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, DMN, have a good one, buddy.

730
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:05,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your call.

731
00:50:06,147 --> 00:50:07,488
[SPEAKER_10]: We always appreciate the inside scoop.

732
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:08,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, bye.

733
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:09,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

734
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty, good Skyping tonight.

735
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:12,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

736
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the Skype calls were pretty clear, too.

737
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:17,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciated that.

738
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:21,736
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are calling Echo123 beforehand, like a good Skyper does.

739
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:23,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, last minute stories, boys and girls.

740
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:25,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any last minute stories here in the studio?

741
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:26,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody?

742
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:26,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody?

743
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:29,524
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not me.

744
00:50:30,004 --> 00:50:39,054
[SPEAKER_10]: There was just some stupid thing about... I know we left out a lot from your roll this week, Loki, but there was just too damn much for two hours, and some of it was kind of... I don't know, but was there anything you really wanted to mention?

745
00:50:40,335 --> 00:50:49,144
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some patent filed by Sony about some stupid electronic device that can roll up, almost like electric paper, but not... I don't know.

746
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:51,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but Sony does a lot of electronic things.

747
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:54,799
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying that it's going to be used for a game system, and I say no.

748
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:56,279
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Sony does a lot of electronic things.

749
00:50:56,299 --> 00:51:01,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I heard the Wii filed, or Nintendo had a patent on instant messaging, and my reaction was, duh.

750
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:06,022
[SPEAKER_10]: You think the Wii's going to have a service kind of like Xbox Lives where you can instant message people?

751
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:06,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

752
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:07,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

753
00:51:07,383 --> 00:51:07,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Duh.

754
00:51:08,823 --> 00:51:09,443
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not news.

755
00:51:09,463 --> 00:51:11,744
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I didn't put it in the list for tonight.

756
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:13,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be PictoChat for a Wii.

757
00:51:13,645 --> 00:51:14,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that would be rad.

758
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:16,577
[SPEAKER_10]: PicktoChat on the internet.

759
00:51:16,597 --> 00:51:17,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that would be pretty sweet.

760
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:20,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to draw penises and have them seen worldwide.

761
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to say for more of our UK listeners, because I'm a huge fan of football.

762
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:30,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, is this UK football or US football?

763
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:30,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like soccer.

764
00:51:30,803 --> 00:51:31,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

765
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:34,204
[SPEAKER_08]: But Love Football is available on Japanese Xbox Live.

766
00:51:34,264 --> 00:51:35,445
[SPEAKER_08]: You can download the demo.

767
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:37,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's actually a link on...

768
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:39,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamers Report.

769
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:52,443
[SPEAKER_08]: It's www.gamersreport.com slash news slash 2820 and it'll teach you in case you didn't know how to create an account, a silver membership for under the Japanese territory to download those demos.

770
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:56,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have to do that.

771
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:01,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Could I do that just by making a new account on my current Xbox?

772
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:01,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

773
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:02,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I might do that.

774
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:11,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Oblivion got patched and all the golden duplication glitches, as you would put it, were removed.

775
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:15,603
[SPEAKER_08]: And also that patch is causing issues, freezes and whatnot.

776
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,465
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there is that undocumented...

777
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:42,238
[SPEAKER_08]: function that was found in the Spring 360 update to clear your cache and it also removes any updates that have been done on live or any of the games so that you can actually if you accidentally play Oblivion connected to live you can unpatch it so that you can cheat in it again.

778
00:52:42,298 --> 00:52:44,400
[SPEAKER_08]: The way you do that actually is pretty simple.

779
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:49,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Under the main menu or whatever you would push or actually going under the

780
00:52:51,125 --> 00:53:03,472
[SPEAKER_08]: System, Blade, and then under Memory, you push Y on either the hard drive or the memory unit and push XX, left button, right button, XX.

781
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:07,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll pop up a little blade saying, do you wish to perform maintenance?

782
00:53:08,055 --> 00:53:10,196
[SPEAKER_08]: If you hit yes, all your updates are gone.

783
00:53:11,777 --> 00:53:18,341
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically a safe way, if you haven't played it and updated it yet, just unhook it from live when you're playing the game.

784
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:19,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty simple.

785
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:20,022
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

786
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:24,741
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go to our final story of the evening, and Loki, it looks like it's yours.

787
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:26,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

788
00:53:29,304 --> 00:53:37,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyways, I think we remember back a couple weeks ago, we talked about Codemasters and how they're basically making a game called The Turds.

789
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:47,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, The Turds is actually a series, and they're being made available through a website called Funsta.com.

790
00:53:47,616 --> 00:53:49,177
[SPEAKER_08]: When I think of turd, I don't think of fun.

791
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:51,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Funsta.com.

792
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:51,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of PlayStation 3.

793
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:52,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

794
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:53,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I think of Taco Bell.

795
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,441
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually play these games right now, or at least one of them.

796
00:53:58,282 --> 00:54:05,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the wonderful games you get to play would be Donkey Pong, which is going to be obviously turd-based.

797
00:54:05,865 --> 00:54:08,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I've heard of Donkey Bong, but I think that's something different.

798
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:10,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Or no, I'm sorry, Donkey Punch, I think?

799
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:12,168
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this is Donkey Pong.

800
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:12,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

801
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:12,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Poopert.

802
00:54:12,888 --> 00:54:13,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Poopert.

803
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:20,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Dung Beetle Rally So wait, these guys just take games that we know and love and put poop in them?

804
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:22,503
[SPEAKER_08]: That's disgusting.

805
00:54:22,783 --> 00:54:29,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Turd Herders, The Men in Crack, and Bogger, which is available now.

806
00:54:30,449 --> 00:54:34,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I equate this with the, what is that, the Crazy Frog thing?

807
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:38,915
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing that sings the Axel F song?

808
00:54:38,955 --> 00:54:39,396
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing.

809
00:54:40,296 --> 00:54:41,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I equate these turd games with that thing.

810
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:43,659
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to put that hideous thing in everything.

811
00:54:44,229 --> 00:54:45,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me put it this way.

812
00:54:45,189 --> 00:54:48,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, it's a toy series that's in the UK.

813
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently.

814
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:52,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Why anyone would want to play with poop?

815
00:54:52,233 --> 00:55:02,638
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently, if you want to play any of these games, go to www.funsta.com That's F-U-N-S-T-A slash turds.

816
00:55:03,238 --> 00:55:07,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can actually play Bogger, which I was playing a little bit during some of those Skype line calls.

817
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just plays like Frogger, but it's sewer and poop based, and it's

818
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:19,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid, you can download poo tones and wallpapers also from that website, and turd merchandise.

819
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:23,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have a poo calculator to find out how much your turds are worth.

820
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:29,542
[SPEAKER_10]: This, by the way, will be the only time that Orange Lounge Radio endorses you playing with your poo.

821
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:32,083
[SPEAKER_10]: But even then, we're looking at you funny.

822
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:38,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So funsta.com, and you can check out Bogger.

823
00:55:38,946 --> 00:55:40,867
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of the games are coming out a little bit later.

824
00:55:42,735 --> 00:56:12,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Dung Beetle Rally June 20th Poopert July 4th You can play Donkey Pong and Bogger right now and July 18th Turd Herders Men in Crack And on that note it's time to end the show Let's go around and get everybody's final thought My final thought is I want this sinus infection to go away Loki, your final thought I want this pink guy to go away And DarkSakura, your final thought I want another cookie

825
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:14,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Reject false icons.

826
00:56:14,607 --> 00:56:15,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

827
00:56:16,288 --> 00:56:17,208
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you wanted it.

828
00:56:18,169 --> 00:56:20,490
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's only my brain telling me that I want one.

829
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually quite satisfied with Swedish ginger cookies.

830
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:25,333
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for the show.

831
00:56:25,373 --> 00:56:30,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in, whether you were downloading, listening live, or what have you, and supporting Independent Radio.
