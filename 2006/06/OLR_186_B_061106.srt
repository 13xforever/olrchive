Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Here it is episode number 186 for this June the 11th of 2006.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And Loki is going to start off this set with a piece of news about the PlayStation 3.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,640
Yes, the PlayStation 3. Basically,

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,080
they're saying that the early units are going to have the hardware to play the

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,240
original, or the PlayStation 2 stuff. So they're going to have PlayStation 2 hardware

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,360
inside to be able to play the older games.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,360
And later as time goes on and they've

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,760
further finish their hardware, they're going to start emulating it via software, which

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,580
good or very bad. I suppose that's one way to make sure backwards compatibility

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,280
is perfect.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,800
That is one way. They did the same thing with the original

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,120
PlayStation 2. The only thing is

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,160
you know, I don't know,

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,320
this time around though it's going to be more hardware than just one chip.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,740
But you could upscale on the original plate, like you could do the faster

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,660
loading. Yeah, but the thing is they have the original chip

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,200
in there to be able to do that. It's just like this is gonna have

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
the PlayStation 2 hardware built in, but you can still upscale that.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,600
That doesn't have anything to do with it. But later on they're going to be going

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
completely software with this. But still this means that it's going to be

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,800
even more hardware crammed inside of this thing, and as it is

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,200
I think they're having trouble fitting the hardware in that case. I mean

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,600
it's going to end up being larger than the original Xbox by the time they're done with it.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,080
Oh, we'll see. You never know. It'll be like the size of a refrigerator or something.

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah, remember that case that we saw before back in E3?

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,080
That was a scale model. It's actually going to be a lot bigger.

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Alright, let's see, moving on, another story about the PlayStation 3.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Watch JP had an interview with Ken Kutaragi regarding the PlayStation 3.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Basically what happened is that the PlayStation 3 is,

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Kutaragi calls it a configuration, not a model.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,080
He says Sony wants to upgrade all aspects of the console as time goes on,

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
like the hard drive size, maybe even the CPU specs.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,100
specs. Sony may release an upgraded version of the console every year, and

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,860
Sony is really not thinking about the price or anything here. Here's the

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,640
direct quote, I think it's okay to release an extended configuration every

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,280
year, laugh. Though I say it like a joke, Dell will do it and Apple will do it too.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,240
In PC, if you fix the spec for two years, you'll be caught up. Computers should be

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,840
changing, right? It's inevitable that 60 gigabytes will become short. Memory may

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,220
become short too. There are many possibilities. So in other words, if you become an early

43
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,140
adopter of the Playstation 3, you may get screwed on this stuff.

44
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,660
And if they didn't... it's a console. It's not a PC. I know they're thinking it's a PC,

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,100
but if it's a PC, then get into the goddamn PC market. Don't try to push this crap. It's

46
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,360
not a fucking Vio. It's a goddamn Playstation. Well, DarkSakura might have more info here

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,840
on what Sony's thinking.

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,320
I just might.

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,920
Basically Sony's basically going off about the hardware setup and how they're having

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,800
it upgraded because basically they're, well actually didn't they try to do that before?

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
Yeah, the PlayStation 2.

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Yeah.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,540
When they brought it out in Europe they're basically trying to push it as a computer

54
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,760
or not as a game console, um, they were saying that basically importing game consoles into

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,520
the European Union is a huge tax drain, where computers are not, so they wanted to get out

56
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,160
of paying the taxes that they actually released Linux for the PS2.

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Huh.

58
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Yeah.

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,800
So, um, basically, that's the theory is that they're trying to do that again, and we might

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,480
even see Linux for the PS3.

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,760
Well yeah, they've flaunted the Linux thing on the PlayStation 3 for everybody, so that's

62
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
not a surprise at all.

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,000
Just the whole concept of calling it a computer is somewhat interesting.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,480
I think it's, well here's the problem with computers and the problem if they do this.

65
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,640
Which system do you develop?

66
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,160
Do you develop for the one that's the weakest, or do you develop for the one that has all

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,040
the new bells and whistles in it because now you're making games that don't work on the

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,400
older systems.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,680
That's not good, and that's not a good thing to actually come out and say that you're gonna

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,160
do when you're trying to get people to buy your system in the first place

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
because it's you know six hundred dollars don't tell them oh yeah by the

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,200
way we're gonna have one that's better that's coming out next year people

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,520
aren't gonna fucking buy your damn system then so remember what we were

74
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,320
saying about the gag order in the first half so seriously needs to shut up for a

75
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,840
little while he does need to learn how to freaking keep their corporate mouth

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,080
shut moving on let's move over to the Nintendo Wii there was some more news on

77
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,800
virtual console this week, right Loki? Yes, that's correct.

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,160
Um, actually, Nintendo president

79
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,320
Sirot, I'm gonna mispronounce this, Satoru

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,720
Iwata, um, he announced, or basically outlined the price ranges

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,640
of some of the games that are gonna be on the virtual console for lease and download in

82
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,840
Japan. Um, he says they're gonna be anywhere between 500 yen and 1000 yen

83
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,000
and basically that, you know, is the equivalent of about $458.99 in the US.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,500
Now that won't translate exactly though I would say five and ten bucks

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,200
probably to be competitive with Xbox Live. Maybe four and eight bucks you know they

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,420
might try to undercut

87
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,480
Xbox Live a little bit who knows but or do the old 99 cents you know for $4.99

88
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,060
and $9.99 and all that stuff.

89
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,060
You know I wouldn't see you know with some of these games like

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,240
even like their first party games whatever they could really do 99 cents I

91
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,640
mean

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,240
the thing is is the Nintendo console if you put the virtual console with like

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,080
thousands of items on their side I believe what happened is that the story

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,060
was slightly

95
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,800
altered later whatever there was some clarification that came out that said

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,200
that

97
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,400
this is only in regards to new stuff

98
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,920
this is not addressed the way he's that they're gonna price the old Nintendo

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Entertainment System games the Super Nintendo games

100
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,520
this is only about new things developed for the Virtual Console that's the price

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
range they're looking at

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm telling you dude if they do 99 cents per game that's gonna be one sweet deal

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,680
Or, as something I have thought of before, and I was saying this on one of the weeknight

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,480
shows here on Orange Lounge Radio, I was saying it's possible that they could bundle games

105
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,600
together, like maybe five games for five bucks, the old NES titles.

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,760
You know, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, and all that stuff, put them together for one

107
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
prize.

108
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,600
But I don't know, we'll see, I suppose.

109
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,320
Or as an added incentive to say, maybe Super Mario Galaxy, bundle in the retro Mario games

110
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
with that too.

111
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,680
Mario Super Mario Brothers 2

112
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,000
and so on so forth.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,040
Moving on I have a story here about the Nintendo DS and the Wii

114
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,300
having some connectivity here. Basically, well of course you know they tried to do

115
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,680
this with the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance but it

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,120
didn't really work out. However, here's some

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,920
things that Iwata said that is going to basically be how the DS and Wii work together.

118
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,680
The DS can be used as a touch screen controller for the Wii.

119
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,720
DS software can be expanded using the Wii.

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,440
The DS can access DS station services

121
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,620
via the Wii. So we were kinda thinking that that might be one feature that you

122
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,360
know you could

123
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,040
download DS demos using your Wii and I think that's a kick-butt idea. It's very

124
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,600
smart.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,880
Nintendo's got some really interesting stuff in store so we'll just

126
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,280
have to see how it all works.

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
you know cuz sometimes things look good on paper but they don't execute very

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,880
well but this this all sounds really good I don't know how they could screw

129
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,360
that up

130
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,480
well on top all that stuff they had a few more things they're announcing

131
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,080
including you know some some new stuff

132
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,960
Pokemon battle revolution was one of the things that they announced

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,920
well I have to say this

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,240
GS 191 says I hope this isn't going to be as shitty as a rearview mirror

135
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,280
yeah but Nintendo actually knows how to use their

136
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,240
Exactly, I mean at least the stuff that they had, granted it may not have been the best

137
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,200
stuff for the system, but it was still pretty cool to play some NES games on the Game Boy

138
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:36,080
Advance when you had Animal Crossing or using it in Crystal Chronicles, stuff like that.

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,920
One thing that they are mentioning though is that the price, or not the price, the release

140
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,900
date is going to be announced before September huh so that's interesting so

141
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,360
we'll have to wait and see I wonder why they're waiting so long maybe they maybe

142
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,740
they still I'm starting to theorize maybe even though we've had all the

143
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,260
speculation that we think October 18th the date and everything maybe Nintendo

144
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,420
really still doesn't know what date they're gonna do maybe they're waiting

145
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,180
until they're absolutely certain they can hit it and then they'll reveal it I

146
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,740
don't know I'm just starting to wildly speculate here but maybe they feel they

147
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,300
don't need this three-month hype going into it. They already have the hype coming off

148
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,720
E3. They don't really need to announce, oh it's coming out, they could do it six weeks

149
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,620
in advance and still get away with it. So who knows? Because let's say they announced

150
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,140
the date in early September and the October 18th date turns out to be true, that would

151
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:36,380
only be like six weeks. But that's enough time. Very interesting. Let's see, also Nintendo

152
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,000
has lots in store for the DS for the rest of the year DS by the way has

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,320
shipped 8.43 million units in Japan in just 18 months that's pretty interesting

154
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,640
let's see on July 20th the company is going to release a Shabiru DSO Riori

155
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,080
Navi it's a cooking program for the DS and then on October the company is going

156
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,320
to release Nihon I'm gonna butcher these names so bad I apologize oh my gosh it's

157
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,780
a huge name basically look at that you want to read that whole thing I can't

158
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:20,400
see okay okay me on Joshiki riyoku can take your kai kanshu others more okay

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:30,180
imma why he told me how can I otona no Joshiki riyoku training ds basically

160
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,300
that is just common knowledge. It's a brain training game called Common

161
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Knowledge. They plan on releasing three to four touch generation series titles

162
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,380
per year and of course those are the games that are designed like the brain

163
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,140
training games and things that are really designed for the adult audience

164
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:53,340
as well as kids. They're saying hardcore gamers will not be left out but there

165
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,660
was no mention of really any new games but Iwata did mention that Final Fantasy

166
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,660
and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are on their way. Final Fantasy III is set for an August 24th release,

167
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,660
but again that's Japan, but I imagine the US won't be far behind. Speaking of Pokemon, Lukey.

168
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:15,660
Yes, Pokemon Battle Revolution. And I'm not a huge Pokemon fan, but what's interesting about this

169
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,660
is the fact that the graphics look a lot better than what we saw at E3 on the Wii.

170
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,660
And that I thought was quite interesting. The game actually though looks like it's going to tie in with

171
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,400
with the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of the new Pokemon games.

172
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:38,300
As well as, suppose they use the DS as a microphone for the game as well.

173
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,300
What looks interesting though, they actually have video up from it.

174
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,100
It looks like Final Fantasy X battles.

175
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,960
I mean basically just really hardcore battles and the graphics look pretty good and I'm

176
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm not sure if you've seen the picture yet but I mean that looks pretty damn

177
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,360
good for a

178
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,440
game that you know a lot better than the stuff we saw at E3.

179
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,540
Well it just goes back to the story even we talked about the first half about the

180
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,600
Xbox and you know they're saying they've only used 60 percent.

181
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
It's the same thing with the Wii in any system you know.

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,820
The very first things you see out the gate aren't going to be the system's full

183
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,080
potential.

184
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,480
And this game is supposed to launch in 2006.

185
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Well, that's kind of early then.

186
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,120
Maybe the Wii's capable of even more and more and more.

187
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,720
We'll see.

188
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
I think so.

189
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,380
All right, well, one interesting game

190
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,080
that may be on its way out soon.

191
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,800
Dark Sakura, you have some news on this.

192
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,200
It's a Zelda spin-off for the DS,

193
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,760
called Mogitate Tingle Bara Irupi Land,

194
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,520
which translates to Fresh Tingle's Rose Colored

195
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
Rupi Land.

196
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,320
Fresh Tingles.

197
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Tingle was in Wind Waker and Majora's Mask.

198
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,840
And also, I mentioned that Tingle actually

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,640
really translates over to tinkle they just changed it because that would be really bad

200
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,560
anyway you are uh basically carted around by this person named rupe uh

201
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,760
i guess it's rupeji it was supposed to be old man rupee it basically tells you to

202
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,840
uh who to maybe rupeji i guess it's written like it'd be rupeji but anyway um it has to

203
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,680
So you have to basically collect rupees and throw them in a magic spring so you go to

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,120
rupee land and you turn into Tingle.

205
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,520
So you also get help from a fairy named Pingle who talks to you by a TV in your house.

206
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,040
And you have to pay people and keep them happy and go through toll gates.

207
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,940
Tingle and Pingle, this sounds like Teletubbies the game.

208
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,940
So another title that's coming up for DS is Kaito Wario 7, guess what, WarioWare.

209
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
Oh, cool.

210
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
Yep.

211
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,940
And it's by the studio that brought us F-Zero Climax on the GBA and Rhythmic Star on itoy.

212
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,940
F-Zero Climax.

213
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,700
Yeah, F-Zero will make you.

214
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win!

215
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
Oh!

216
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,820
Alright, moving on, Loki, let's get into some political-oriented news, Loki.

217
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
Yes.

218
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,540
Clinton opened her big fat mouth and she basically said that the federal

219
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,260
government needs to step in to ensure that electronic media including video

220
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,100
games isn't harming children's development and what she's basically

221
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:24,140
suggesting is that they approve a federal funded research program into the

222
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,820
effects or broad effects of media from everything from television to video

223
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,780
games to the internet on children. What she needs to research is a way that parents do

224
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:41,260
their fucking job. And she also needs to research her goddamn new platform to be, you know,

225
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,380
bitching about. Cause I don't like it. Well you know what's interesting here now, if you

226
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,260
read a little further down in the story it says there's a quote from Clinton that says

227
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,380
obviously parents are on the front line but a lot of them need help. Very interesting

228
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
quote there.

229
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,380
Parents do not need goddamn help.

230
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,380
You could put...

231
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,460
Hold on, I want to point this out too.

232
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,480
This statement, by the way, came just like hours before the House of Representatives

233
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,100
made that indecency fine increase, $32,500 up to $325,000.

234
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,220
That was a 379 to 35 vote in the House.

235
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,060
You know what, it's not the place of our government to be sticking their nose into how parents

236
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,620
do their job.

237
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,500
need to actually be the ones to do their job and if you're not ready to do that

238
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,740
job don't have the children we mean they don't understand how to do their job

239
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,860
there's a goddamn reading system that tells them what it's appropriate for

240
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,700
what age what kind of content is in said product and there's also parental

241
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,620
controls on your console systems mean how much more do I need to go over there

242
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,920
wipe their ass for them too because it's apparently oh I'm so helpless I can't

243
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,100
possibly monitor what my kid sees you know there's reading systems and

244
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,220
everything this has been done it's just the parents are too goddamn lazy to do

245
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:02,580
this and then when something bad happens I'm gonna sue for lots of money now so

246
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,940
you know that's basically what it comes down to the parents are retarded and

247
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,140
then they get paid for being retarded Thank You America rewarding the retarded

248
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,340
all right speaking of people not this just keeps going speaking of people not

249
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:25,260
doing their jobs and guess what one of the judges in the John a Gotti jr. trial

250
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,540
was doing well I already know the answer but I'll act surprised basically he was

251
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:39,860
playing solitaire well was it a she yes it was trying to find the name Shira

252
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:47,220
Sheindlin Wow who was a playing a solitaire during the trial well basically

253
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:56,180
while I'm trying to see who the name was I think it was Curtis still one of the

254
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,940
guardian angels from it's the one the anti-crime groups basically was

255
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,940
testifying and the judge was playing solitaire Wow and you know I never like

256
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,180
Like until I had jury duty, I always thought the judge just kind of sat there and just

257
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,500
kind of watched everything going on, but the judge really is doing other stuff while people

258
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
are there testifying.

259
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
And the judge will just kind of, like when the judge, like when one of the lawyers yells

260
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,900
objection, that's when the judge kind of looks over and will look at the last few things

261
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,580
said and then make a ruling.

262
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,760
Like otherwise the judge, I don't know if he's doing emails or looking up law things

263
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,900
on the internet or maybe playing solitaire, I don't know, I doubt he is, he seems like

264
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
a really smart guy.

265
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Poor no.

266
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,900
It's interesting what the judges could possibly get away with.

267
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,900
I mean, if I hadn't done jury duty this week, I would have never imagined that this could be humanly possible.

268
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:52,900
There's an interesting quote here from Cilla basically comparing the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg firing a city worker for playing solitaire at the desk.

269
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:00,900
To quote, should a federal judge be playing video solitaire when an employee of the New York City government gets fired for playing video solitaire?

270
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,220
I don't think any of us are that good at multitasking. To me, it's an abuse and an outrage.

271
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,780
Honestly, you know,

272
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,300
there's a type- I'm gonna point out something- not everyone's aware of this-

273
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,100
there is a type of learning called kinesthetic learning.

274
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,500
What this means is that you learn better while you were doing other things, when

275
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,040
you have something else pulling your attention.

276
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,580
Um, actually, we did this at work, we did a study on this at work,

277
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,020
where we were given, uh, like toys.

278
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,420
like you know Legos and stuff to do while we were at one of our training classes and

279
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,560
At least half of the class actually retain the knowledge in our training class better

280
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,460
So I you know a lot of times when when you know, I have to listen to something

281
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,140
I'm doodling a I doodle in class, you know people some people learn or actually I would say pay attention

282
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,540
Better when they've got something else going on something that is you know

283
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:59,300
when they keep one I guess one of their senses occupied be it you know in a

284
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,380
playing solitaire that you know they'll be able to better listen I mean there

285
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,720
are people that are just like that and on top of that you know I would rather

286
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
have a judge that's good at multitasking than having someone that can only focus

287
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,320
on one thing at one time and on top of that it's also proven that people who

288
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,220
play video games are better have a better understanding for complex

289
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,200
situations it almost sounds like you're okay with her playing solitaire I am

290
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm okay with it.

291
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
It's funny.

292
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
What's the point?

293
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
I can play solitaire and freaking listen to a lecture.

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,720
I used to do that in class when I would bring my laptop up and play solitaire during my

295
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,400
class and I got an A in the damn class.

296
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,280
I used to play Doom in my Mac lab class.

297
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,480
It's just an interesting perspective, that's all I can say.

298
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,200
I think they should be fired because solitaire is not a god damn game.

299
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
It's just cards.

300
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,880
And the fact that you have a game on a computer with cards, that's solitaire is retarded.

301
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,000
is so last century i have to read the comments in our chatroom orange lounge radio.com click

302
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,820
on chat uh ssj100 matt says they should be playing phoenix right more is making the obvious

303
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:08,040
joke there uh blaze says the judge does not watch porn loki judges are heavily involved

304
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:16,300
and can actually swing a trial for or against the prosecution defense anyway moving right

305
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,060
along loki you have uh some more political oriented news yeah as if this is a big surprise

306
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,860
Because the ASA is going to sue Minnesota.

307
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
And why are they suing them?

308
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,500
Of course, because of the recent law that they passed that would fine kids $25 for buying

309
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,360
or renting M or adult rated games.

310
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,360
And basically, you know, they said that this is definitely costing taxpayers a lot of money

311
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,500
for a law that they can't really enforce in the first place.

312
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,420
And they said, and I quote, the bill has tortured effort to end the run of the first amendment

313
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,580
by punishing kids directly fails under the Constitution because children have rights

314
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,720
under the First Amendment like of all other citizens. The state is attempting to impose

315
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,640
liability on children because they know that the courts have constantly held that they

316
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,340
cannot penalize retailers. We believe that the courts will agree that fighting children

317
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,800
violates the First Amendment as well. And if this law is implemented, it will not only

318
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,560
limit the First Amendment rights for Minnesota residents. It will create a huge amount of

319
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,320
confusion for retailers, parents, and children. I'm confident that the court will affirm our

320
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,720
position given the ruling on similar statutes in other jurisdictions. And here's my problem

321
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,280
with the whole thing is why the hell did this law get passed in the first place? They don't

322
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:42,880
have similar laws for R-rated movies or NC-17 movies. It's fine for kids to see that stuff

323
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,840
and that's more lifelike than games so what the hell this is

324
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,440
stupid it's really stupid and it will probably get overturned anyway so

325
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,480
whatever.

326
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,760
Moving on to another state and their political news Louisiana

327
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,040
the Senate has unanimously passed a bill

328
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,280
that had a lot of involvement by he who shall not be named on this program

329
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,800
anymore

330
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,040
the media horn if you don't know who we're talking about his name rhymes with

331
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,080
Mr. Fuckompson... Jackass.

332
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Yeah. Anyway, so let's see here. Basically what happened is that

333
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,080
the measure was

334
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,640
written by he who shall not be named. Actually, no I'm sorry.

335
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,560
Oh, it's a co-author. He's a co-author involved in this here.

336
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,360
It was written by Representative Roy Burrell

337
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,000
and he was just a co-author on it. It's HB 1381

338
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,400
and it makes it illegal to sell rent or lease a game to a minor if it meets

339
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,580
three conditions.

340
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,580
If the average person would think appeals to the minor's morbid entrance

341
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,360
in violence

342
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,840
or if it depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to

343
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,200
prevailing standards

344
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,260
and the game also qualifies if it lacks serious literary,

345
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,640
artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

346
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,200
Violators could be fined between a hundred and two thousand dollars and sentenced

347
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
up to 12 months in a state prison. What a bunch of horseshit.

348
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
I mean, where's the checks here?

349
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,760
I hate these vague, vague laws that people are coming up with. Where is the check?

350
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,400
Who determines if a game lacks

351
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,760
serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors?

352
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
It's not the government's job to

353
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,080
to rate art. Though that same description, it actually does go into

354
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,160
free speech right because that actually is one of the defining rights for what allows free speech

355
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,360
and what doesn't. They're basically, they're basically trying to manipulate the constitution

356
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,720
into applying it toward video games instead of saying, oh well you're denying us our free

357
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,400
speech right, trying to make it fall under what's allowable free speech. It's the same thing. Let

358
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,960
me look at the first amendment. No, I actually, I want to, I want to, uh, I want to hear this, uh,

359
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,280
First Amendment passage here. Let's see here, I'll read some more here.

360
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,040
It was approved by a key committee last week, HB 1381.

361
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,320
It was passed the other day in a 35 to nothing vote

362
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,440
in the Louisiana State Senate. It now is going to go to

363
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,920
Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco,

364
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,200
Governor of Louisiana, and of course the governor is expected to sign the bill

365
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,800
because of the unanimous vote

366
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,680
and the recent linking of games and teenage murder suspects in the Louisiana

367
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,280
media.

368
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,160
and of course you can expect that the ESA will have a problem with this and file

369
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,920
a lawsuit immediately. Any luck?

370
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,120
Well, I'm trying to find it because basically it's a matter of court

371
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,760
interpretation because we went over this

372
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,680
in my law class, some of my law classes that I've taken.

373
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,080
I mean basically just looking through this, we've been dealing with this

374
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,120
since the, you know, country, you know, was created.

375
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,560
Looking on here there's also a note on here

376
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,000
that basically they can punish words

377
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,520
that by their very nature invoke danger

378
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,540
to the public peace and to the security of the state.

379
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,500
That's one of the things listed.

380
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,340
I'm trying to find the word.

381
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,880
I got, here it is, on Wikipedia, on original Wikipedia.

382
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,460
Here's the exact text right here, yep.

383
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,040
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment

384
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,320
of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

385
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,280
or abridging the freedom of speech or the press

386
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,120
or the right of the people peaceably to assemble

387
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:35,120
and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

388
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm trying to...

389
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,640
there was... there were a number of cases, though, where they

390
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,380
brought that in under... here it is, obscenity.

391
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,400
The federal government... just to go... I'm quoting Wikipedia, basically. The federal

392
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,520
government in the states have long permitted to restrict obscene and pornographic

393
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,240
speech.

394
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,240
While obscene speech generally has no protection under the First Amendment,

395
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
pornography is subject to little regulation.

396
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,560
the exact definition of obscenity and pornography has changed over time.

397
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,140
And basically, I really recommend that people go on Wikipedia and read this.

398
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,960
I mean, there's a lot of stuff here, but they're basically saying in Miller versus California

399
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,140
in 1973, a work is obscene if it, and this is basically what's referred to as the Miller test,

400
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,620
which is where the basis of that law in Louisiana,

401
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,120
a work is obscene if it would be found appealing to the prurient interest

402
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,180
by an average person applying contemporary community standards

403
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,220
depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and has no

404
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,060
serious literary, artistic, and political or scientific value." So basically they're

405
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,800
taking

406
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,720
what they've applied to movies and applying it to video games.

407
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,780
Okay, let's just take this even a step further than that. Okay, let's punish people for not

408
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,640
sharing

409
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,580
because basically, you know, right here you're taking the parents responsibility for

410
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,900
deciding whether kids need,

411
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,260
you know, can see, let's go ahead and have the government step in for their

412
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,980
other jobs like making sure that the kids share their toys with their

413
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,860
brothers and sisters. And I think we should find the kids

414
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,680
that do not share their toys and we should also basically

415
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,100
enact communism all over again because this is pretty much

416
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,860
what they kinda want to do anyways. Wow. It's retarded!

417
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,860
Retarded. Moving on, now the ESRB has a

418
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,280
perfectly fine rating system out there it just seems like people aren't aware

419
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,440
of it so Loki

420
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,200
steps taken to try and promote the ESRB system? Exactly and Penny Arcade as we

421
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,120
mentioned before

422
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,000
is working on ads for the ESRB and some of these were actually kinda shown

423
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,020
a little bit at E3 and they've actually unveiled

424
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,100
a couple of them so far and they look pretty good they've just got a character

425
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,160
with text written around the outside and for example

426
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,220
I'm gonna pull up one here for Sarah

427
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,440
one of the ones advertising the E-rating.

428
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,140
It says, because Sarah plays video games, there is a group of people making sure

429
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,260
that the games she plays are rated.

430
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,940
They're called the Entertainment Software Ratings Board,

431
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,960
but that's just the long way of saying it. Usually it's called

432
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,660
the ESRB. They check

433
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,160
games to help

434
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,640
make sure it's hard to read. It's hard to read because it goes around the girl, huh?

435
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,660
I don't know. That might be something in the ad. To make sure it's

436
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,920
right for you, your older brother, mom and dad, anybody.

437
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,240
Somebody's got to do it, and they're the ones that do.

438
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,000
So it's basically an ad saying, you know what, this is being done.

439
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,320
And the same thing's being done with film. I don't understand.

440
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,200
Okay, they've done it in the past. They've gone after

441
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,880
movies and stuff, but still though,

442
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,560
it's the same thing it's media just because it's interactive big

443
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,600
deal you know big deal if it's interactive but it doesn't

444
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,920
it's still the same thing I mean I can go watch you know kung fu movie when I

445
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,480
you know kick the crap out of people afterwards it's the same damn thing

446
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,000
so I don't know why they're not attacking all media at the same time

447
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,400
alright moving on we're speaking of promotion

448
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,680
the ESRB trying to promote their rating systems there we like to promote good

449
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,400
websites on this program don't we

450
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,880
DarkSakura? Sure do. And DarkSakura is the queen of the internet. She surfs the

451
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
internet up and down and

452
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,120
finds a website that she would like to share with you guys in her website of

453
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,640
the week. So DarkSakura, where should the kids be going this week?

454
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,400
Well, I talked about them last week

455
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,760
because I'd had a really good experience actually doing

456
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,440
business with the business side of the site. But I wanted to actually promote the forums at

457
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
junkyspot.com

458
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,040
It's J-U-N-K-Y spot.com

459
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,940
For anyone who's basically getting into it, like I've been getting into the dollies, the

460
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,400
model dollies where you customize everything, I swear I found more information on their

461
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,780
forums than I have anywhere else in the entirety of the internet.

462
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,500
On top of that, it's a good place for communication for anybody who's into that.

463
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,280
I've had nothing but a good experience there.

464
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Everyone's friendly.

465
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
It's like I haven't even seen...

466
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,700
It's the only forum I've ever been to that I haven't seen any flaming at all on.

467
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,260
Is there going to be anything for me if I'm not into dollies?

468
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,260
No.

469
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,260
No.

470
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,260
But I've talked to a few of our listeners who have gotten into it.

471
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:21,940
So I figured, you know, this is my, this has to be my side of the week, that's fine.

472
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,300
But also though there are actually some good painting tips though.

473
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,300
I mean a lot of these my husband was saying yeah that applies to model cars too.

474
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,100
Ok fair enough.

475
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,180
So I'm being girly ok?

476
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,540
If you like to dress up your models in Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, maybe you want

477
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
to dress up a dolly.

478
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
I've seen some.

479
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:48,080
There's people who have made, who have done basically cosplay doll-fies, where they've

480
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,140
actually made characters from different games.

481
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,140
Wow.

482
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,620
I think it's pretty cool.

483
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,820
Now that could be interesting, dolls based off of, you know, the characters.

484
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,780
People would make those and sell them for tons of money at conventions.

485
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,260
You can actually buy, though, pre-done, you know, they're made by different companies,

486
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,940
like they've actually started releasing I think they're the the cool girls line

487
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,800
I'm trying to remember I think it's Takara that puts it out they have a cutie

488
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,580
honey and they have a Kusanagi or is it whatever her name is from Ghost in the

489
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,140
Shell they have a doll for that and a lot of different places but it was kind

490
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,460
of a weird little niche thing it's a hobby I picked up while I was you know

491
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,140
out of work, but it's it's a good good informative place. All right, going back

492
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,100
into some gaming news. Loki, some news in the Street Fighter world. Yes, and it's

493
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,780
it's interesting, kind of a rumor at the point right now, but it says according to

494
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:52,420
the website snk-capcom.com, a DC versus Street Fighter game may be indeed

495
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,820
in the works, and they're confirmed or they've confirmed with both parties at

496
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,640
this year's E3 that the legalities of the game were being considered and it'd be

497
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,520
pretty interesting that they came out with that. Now you might remember they

498
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,080
used to do like a Marvel versus Capcom and Marvel versus Street Fighter so DC

499
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
versus Street Fighter would be kind of cool although I think Superman would kick

500
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,820
everyone's ass in that so I don't know. It'd be interesting to see. Superman versus

501
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,860
like Chun-Li I think he's gonna beat her ass. We'll see. Just a little bit there.

502
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,300
She might have kryptonite panties on, you never know.

503
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,580
Alright, now this is very interesting if you're a Final Fantasy fan

504
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,540
certainly you're anticipating Final Fantasy 13 and this is why the

505
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,900
PlayStation 3 is still cool for some people because Final Fantasy 13

506
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,020
looks to be pretty ass-kicking and Advent Children actually is inspiring

507
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,940
Final Fantasy 13 somewhat, not maybe directly but you know

508
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,540
while the DVD kinda got some mixed reviews from people,

509
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,380
it has some great kick-butt battle sequences in the movie like some really

510
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
fast pacing.

511
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,360
You guys have probably seen this in the trailer.

512
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,140
Well this is interesting because Final Fantasy 13's director, Motomo Toriyama, said,

513
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,020
Final Fantasy 13 attempts to see how far it's possible to make Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children's

514
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,860
battles into a game.

515
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,420
Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children is a video production and it showed us battles that have

516
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,980
not been achievable in Final Fantasy so far.

517
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,980
With Final Fantasy 13, we're focusing on how far we can realize the video.

518
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,960
So that might be a pretty sweet game, imagining you're getting to control some of those battle

519
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,040
Sequences that'll be that'll sell some PlayStation threes

520
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:32,500
That'll that'll get the Sony family coming out until next year way late next year if even that now will be in Japan

521
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,480
I mean how long did Final Fantasy 12 take to come out? Oh my gosh, and it's still not out here exactly

522
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,920
I I would say I I don't even think we're gonna get it next year

523
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,500
I would say we will have Final Fantasy 13 Christmas 2008. I would anticipate but you know, what do I know?

524
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
I'm just some guy on the internet

525
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,020
Loki, you have some news regarding online games.

526
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,300
Yeah, actually the online game market's huge. How huge?

527
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,980
They're estimating it's going to reach 13 billion dollars by the

528
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,820
year 2011 and of course this is

529
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,700
you know a lot in part for games such as World of Warcraft

530
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,380
and you know Everquests and whatnot but I'm just basically,

531
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,700
even nowadays you see tons of MMOs coming around

532
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,280
that's just the way everything's kinda headed nowadays and even like Xbox Live

533
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,760
arcade and a lot of online games everything's really just heading online

534
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,100
so it's no wonder that it's gonna be that big and I wouldn't be surprised if

535
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:33,440
it hits 13 billion even sooner than that I mean that's kind of a you know being

536
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,120
safe when it comes to big it doesn't get much bigger than World of Warcraft and

537
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,200
you know there was a story we talked about on this program probably like

538
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,060
Like three or four months ago, we were talking about this guy, Brian Kopp, who'd been sued

539
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:54,140
by Blizzard Entertainment because he put out the book that he was selling on eBay and it

540
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,300
had the maps and things.

541
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Remember that?

542
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
You remember we kind of got into that?

543
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Well, guess what?

544
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,060
Blizzard dropped the lawsuit.

545
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,520
So that's pretty much all there is to say.

546
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,320
There was basically a settlement.

547
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,180
There was no monetary compensation for Kopp and basically the companies agreed to withdraw

548
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,100
their previous takedown notices and drop all the infringement claims, and also it

549
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,580
was said they'd refrain from filing any future takedown notices against the same

550
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:24,180
items COP has already disputed through counter notices. COP, by the way, will

551
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,780
be retaining the book's disclaimers about its unofficial nature, and he won't

552
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,020
include links or instructions on how to locate cheats in the game, so it's

553
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,100
strictly a strategy guide without endorsing cheating, so a little bit of

554
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:42,220
compromise on both sides. And that's good. I think it's good that they compromised

555
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,980
and worked it out and didn't have to, you know, go to trial and all that messy

556
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:50,700
stuff. Anyway, we're gonna head on over to our Skype line. It's www.orangelaungeradio.com.

561
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,080
phone call coming in so I'm gonna go ahead and pick that up hello you're on

562
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,040
orange lounge radio hi sky it's me Ravens dolphin hello Ravens dolphin

563
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,280
what's on your mind I just picked up the DS light ah yes the DS lights are out

564
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,200
today what do you think I love it yeah what's so what's so great about it tell

565
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,280
me I don't know if I'm totally sold on the DS light yet tell me why I need to

566
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,920
get this when I already have the DS you know fat all right all right just for

567
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,760
one reason this thing has brighter screens you I'm not saying this just

568
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,040
because when I turn this thing on I notice a big difference from the

569
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,640
original hmm there's colors I haven't seen before what about the claims that

570
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,840
it's a little more uncomfortable to play it is yeah it's kind of like the PSP

571
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,520
Have you tried playing Metroid Prime on it? Yes, I have.

572
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,760
And it's a world of difference. Is it better?

573
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,960
Yeah, it's much better. Interesting, because that game's kind of hard to play on the DS

574
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,400
fat.

575
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,720
It sure is. I don't know what else to call it. There's the DS

576
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,800
Heavy. I like the DS Fat. The DS Fatty.

577
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,600
I like crappy. It's not crappy.

578
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,040
DS is a good system. It's just a little fat. I like the light better.

579
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,480
Alright, oh

580
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,340
What about now here? Here's somebody in our here's somebody in our chat room here a VX Jason XV says brighter is totally unnecessary

581
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,920
What do you say to that? I don't see much ari masen says I got my DS light today

582
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,520
I love its death brightness setting the red is more redder now

583
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,120
Yeah, like I like fourth is death and you know, and oh, can I say something? Yeah

584
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:57,400
All right, I stand in line for three minutes for a DS light. No one was at my ebb store

585
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,720
Well, there hasn't been a whole lot of promotion leading up to launch day

586
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,800
I think it's something Nintendo just kind of wants out there and it's gonna be circulating

587
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't think there there was really a huge push for a stellar launch for this

588
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,520
So yeah, but in Japan people have been waiting in line for days to get a DS

589
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,480
Well, that's everybody else's important one. They stand in line for Dragon Quest too, yet here nobody cares, although they should.

590
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,080
Yeah, but they at least Dragon Quest on a Sunday or a Saturday.

591
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,220
Alright. Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

592
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,500
But, uh, don't support Sony. Well, we'll see. Amen. They, you know what?

593
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,200
Things can change. I realize the world is anti Sony right now, but Devil's Advocate, you guys, Sony might say something

594
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,360
it's gonna win you back all right we'll see all right Ravenstaufen have a good

595
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,440
one you too bye all right see you later thanks for the call let's go to another

596
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,880
phone call hello you are on Orange Lounge radio who's this well hi who's

597
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:07,220
this hi you're sounding a little distorted there maybe pull the

598
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,960
microphone back just a little bit what's on your mind sorry about that that's

599
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
That's alright.

600
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,280
Well, I'm just gonna go on a rant if you don't mind.

601
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
You're gonna what?

602
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,680
Go on a rant.

603
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,160
Okay, go ahead and rant for a little bit.

604
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,200
Put the microphone a little bit closer, but not as close as it was before, and then rant.

605
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Okay.

606
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,280
I hate Final Fantasy.

607
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,840
Why?

608
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:39,840
I have played it, I do not like it, I respect people who like it, but I do not like it.

609
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,120
wait which one are all of them

610
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,960
uh... i have played

611
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,080
all the big ones power of pharisee seven

612
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,500
ten

613
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,600
all those and

614
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,160
so you haven't played any of the classics

615
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
okay wait though though i gotta ask

616
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,960
why though you just you say you don't like it but i'm not hearing a why what

617
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,520
is it about the game that you don't like i just find it boring and

618
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,320
a little

619
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,120
just kind of weird

620
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,280
not too original

621
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,520
okay now what kind of games do you like

622
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,340
it could just be because I'm into the action games.

623
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,320
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking here is that maybe you're just not the type of

624
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,000
person that plays role-playing games. Like, I

625
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,920
love, or I love these Final Fantasy games, most of them, some of them were

626
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,540
stupid,

627
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:27,040
like eight, but, you know, I don't care for sports games.

628
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,440
And, you know, I realize why sports games are out there, and there's some pretty

629
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,460
good sports games out there if you're into those types of games, but for me,

630
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,520
I don't really play sports games. I don't enjoy them.

631
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,320
So that's just kind of the type of game I'm not into.

632
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,340
So I'm cool with you not liking Final Fantasy as long as you still have respect for people

633
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,880
that are into it, because I respect people that play sports titles.

634
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,160
And also, and I thank you for respecting it, but I've had many people say, you suck, you

635
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
suck!

636
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,000
Final Fantasy rules, you suck!

637
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,440
Well just, instead of this, try a different approach.

638
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,820
Instead next time, knocking on Final Fantasy, tell your friends about the games you do like

639
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:11,220
and make them play those games okay less hate more love get it and also as I

640
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,780
know as you may have noticed I tried it before I judged all right well that's

641
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,660
good that I can respect one map for hate or that I can I will not mention all

642
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,420
right all right we're gonna let you go buddy we got more calls coming in but

643
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:32,220
thanks for the call okay all right later all right let's take another call here

644
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

645
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,220
Hi, this is the Amplidude.

646
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
Hello.

647
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
I'm just calling in.

648
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Hi Amplidude, what's on your mind?

649
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Just calling in. I didn't get to listen to much of the show besides the past 10 minutes.

650
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:55,220
But as the last caller, Final Fantasy, if you don't like any of them, at least you should give 5 a chance.

651
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,220
That was my favorite one.

652
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,220
5? You know what? I disagree because 5 is great.

653
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:06,160
Five is great, but five is also the most complicated and it's the most like hardcore role-playing one out of them

654
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,560
I think it's just my opinion. I think five would have the reverse effect

655
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,200
I think he would dislike five more than any of the others

656
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,560
But see you and Dark Sakura and even me we already like Final Fantasy

657
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,100
So Final Fantasy 5 is just more of a good thing

658
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,700
But when you don't like role-playing games to begin with Final Fantasy 5 is gonna be more of a bad thing

659
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,420
all right, I just like the job system, that's what a

660
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:34,420
10-2. A lot of people didn't like it, but I at least liked how they tried to bring back the job system.

661
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Yeah, 10-2 was a nod right back to that, except one thing I liked about 5 is that you could combine basically your character classes to create, you know, you have a white mage and then you have a fighter, you have a paladin basically.

662
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
Yeah.

663
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,420
What other types of games do you like, AmpliDude?

664
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Pretty much all RPGs. I was just playing BeatMania not too long ago before I called.

665
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
US one or Japanese one?

666
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Uh, seventh Japanese.

667
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Okay, that's one of the styles I don't own.

668
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,420
Because I took a break from BeatMania for a little while.

669
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,420
I skipped that one.

670
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420
No, I didn't. I have seventh style.

671
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,420
Seventh has some of my favorite music in it.

672
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,420
No, I have seventh style. I didn't get ninth and up.

673
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,420
I might need to borrow some of those from you at some point.

674
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,420
If I ever get mine back from George.

675
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,420
Ah, I see.

676
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,420
That's cool. BeatMania is a good time. Have you played Red yet?

677
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,420
Oh, yeah.

678
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,420
I actually left it at home, so I had to deal with seven.

679
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,420
2007 but 11 is

680
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:32,560
Awesome. It's it's a beautiful setup. I need to play more of it. I absolutely do any other thoughts for our listeners amplitude

681
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
um, well my

682
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:42,040
Friends girlfriend brought over a DS light today. It's pretty kick-ass. I have to say what are the Reds indeed redder?

683
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,900
um

684
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,300
It's a lot brighter. Yeah, it feels a lot different than I would

685
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,280
uh expected like I expected it to feel a lot different than it did but is it

686
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,180
worth 120 it was 129 what are they asking like that yeah is it worth that

687
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,500
much money well since I've had mine since it came out it kind of turned

688
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,100
shitty so I need to get myself a new one yeah well I don't know I'm still on the

689
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,020
fence with it maybe if I have extra money after my vacation coming up we'll

690
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,980
see all right amplitude thanks so much for the call I'm gonna let you go so we

691
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,620
and get some more calls, okay?

692
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,460
All right, cool.

693
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,360
Have a good one, buddy.

694
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,200
You too.

695
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,520
Bye-bye.

696
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,940
Let's go to at least one more call, maybe two.

697
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,780
Let's go to this one.

698
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

699
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,500
Hello.

700
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,940
Hi, who's this?

701
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,300
Nintendo Maniac 64.

702
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,020
Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.

703
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,780
What's on your mind, buddy?

704
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,940
First off, what is your name?

705
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,740
Like Bism or Bism or something.

706
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,540
He really wanted me to call in.

707
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,300
Okay, what do you want to call in about?

708
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,620
First off, you can say about DS Lite and stuff.

709
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,020
Well, you know I was up in New York and stuff,

710
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,700
and at Nintendo World, I actually saw them

711
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,620
installing the DS Lite demo stations, which was kinda cool.

712
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,100
That's cool.

713
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,940
What was the Nintendo store like?

714
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,580
You went there for the launch?

715
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,300
Uh, no, I was just up there in New York

716
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,860
for this art show my sister was in.

717
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,860
It was sort of like Scholastics and stuff.

718
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,040
That's right, because didn't you put out the call

719
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,140
in the last episode of the show

720
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,980
you wanted to meet fans or something?

721
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,220
Yeah, nobody came, so like,

722
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:17,060
there's my SU for the week. I'll come next time, if I have money.

723
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,260
So did you get to actually play the DS Lite when you were there?

724
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,560
Um, yeah I did, but like

725
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,660
I mean, sure it was brighter and stuff, but okay

726
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,540
whoop-de-doo, it wasn't that great to me.

727
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,540
Ah, so a little bit of a diss, the red's not so red.

728
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,140
Well I didn't feel red, I mean like I just didn't care too much

729
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,480
and uh...

730
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,240
i got to phone some people at DDR mario mix

731
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,420
like the super is just like an easier heavy level

732
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,660
i haven't played mario mix since E3 last year so

733
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,900
and i gotta quickly say a few things um...

734
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,820
there is a hack out there

735
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,660
for

736
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,540
a regular disk that you can make the screen

737
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,860
just as bright as

738
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,300
a dslite you have the

739
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,460
multiple light setting like on dslite but i don't want to void my warranty

740
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,220
Some of our warranties are already passed.

741
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,240
All right, fair enough.

742
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,440
Yes, we have talked about that hack

743
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,860
on previous episodes of the show.

744
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,240
And just one last question.

745
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,080
Yes.

746
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,980
For any DS layers out there who have them.

747
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,500
Do these guys know if the DS battery's the exact same

748
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,960
shaped and stuff as a regular DS battery?

749
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,380
Oh, the DS battery stuff.

750
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,860
I don't know, because we don't own one.

751
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,420
I imagine it's probably the same charger,

752
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,700
but I'll let someone in the chat answer that.

753
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Yeah, it probably is. But you don't put actual batteries into it, it only runs on the charger.

754
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:45,700
Well, I'm saying that battery life is twice as long.

755
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,700
Gotcha. Oh, is the battery life longer? I don't know. We'll see. We'll ask Chad.

756
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:55,700
I was just wondering if you could somehow get the battery out of the new one, put it in your old DS, and what if you get like 40 hours or something?

757
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,700
Actually, Jeremy Todd 1 says it's not the same charger.

758
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
Oh, really?

759
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,740
interesting I will see we'll see there and saccharine is agreeing well we'll

760
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,140
see what the chat room says and I'll fill you okay

761
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,420
all right we're gonna let you go buddy we'll try and take one more call all

762
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,060
right okay apparently my dsl just dropped out on me for a second

763
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,860
ouch well you can always download podcast no no I mean reconnected just

764
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,060
those my point

765
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:25,740
alrighty have a good one buddy yeah bye but someone in chat room pointing out

766
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,800
there that the battery life is of course shorter if you use the four times the

767
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,360
brightness there so the higher the brightness the shorter the battery life

768
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,280
obviously same thing on most laptops etc Skype line is open I saw somebody else

769
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,320
trying to call in there but you have a chance now if you want to get in there

770
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,160
our Skype Skype lines name is orange lounge radio all one word or you can

771
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,620
call us on the regular telephone as well nine one six two two six ninety sixty

772
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,120
seven here we go one last call for tonight hello you are on orange lounge

773
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,340
radio who's this? Good evening OLR it's DMN how you doing? Hi DMN what's on your

774
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:04,080
mind buddy? Um I'd like to give an FU of a week to my own company. Don't you work

775
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,560
for Nintendo? I do. Uh-oh what do they do? It's nothing it's just a disturbing

776
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,240
trend I've been seeing with the DS games since we've been on the subject of the DS

777
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,440
light with the games like brain training and Nintendogs I don't know if you guys

778
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,540
notice this but these games seem to have a shelf life of two weeks and that's it

779
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,780
and people would just toss them away no I agree I regret I think what at e3 last

780
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,220
year I said in ten dogs was like the runner-up for game of show I totally

781
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,260
regret that because it was fun for the hour I played at e3 or not even that but

782
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,660
it's fun for the time I played at e3 when I actually got at home to play it

783
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:44,100
was the thrill lasted a week maybe two I traded yesterday it's unfortunate

784
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:48,740
because I I've yet to see a BS game that's had a good replay value short of

785
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:54,000
Mario Kart and Tetris, and those are the online games which obviously give those games more

786
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
replay value.

787
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,380
I can't stand Prime Hunters, because first person shooters on a portable are just a bad

788
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,380
idea.

789
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,140
Well, hopefully, and we're echoing really bad by the way, you might want to back away

790
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,540
from your speakers a little bit or turn it down.

791
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,020
Hopefully there will be more online games in Nintendo's future, many many more.

792
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,260
Oh definitely.

793
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,920
Alright.

794
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,520
But that's about it.

795
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,900
I wanted to rent that and see what people thought.

796
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,860
Hopefully I can get to my inside sources because I'm starting back up at Nintendo.

797
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,460
I think we're starting Wii testing tomorrow.

798
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,460
So hopefully I can get more info on that for you guys as well.

799
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,260
Now wait a minute, didn't you say that you were against, like on an earlier show, you

800
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,800
were against the October date because the Wii's weren't in yet?

801
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
So maybe...

802
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,800
Yes, that's what I've been hearing.

803
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,900
Ah, so maybe it'll get interesting.

804
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,600
Yes, maybe it will and also operation get Reggie Phil's aim on the shows now underway. Thank you, please

805
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,880
I would I would love to make sweet love to Reggie through an interview form on this problem

806
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,280
I'll be sure to wear protection during that show I will

807
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,920
All right, DM and have a good one buddy. Thanks for your time. We always appreciate the inside scoop. All right. Bye later

808
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,840
All righty good Skype in tonight. Good job

809
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Most of the Skype calls were pretty clear too, I appreciated that.

810
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,840
You guys are calling Echo 1, 2, 3 beforehand, like a good

811
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,840
Skyper does. Alright, last minute stories boys and girls, do we have any last minute stories

812
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,840
here in the studio? Anybody, anybody?

813
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,840
There was just some stupid thing about... I know we left out a lot from your

814
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,840
role this week, Loki, but there was just too damn much for two hours and some of it was

815
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,840
kind of, I don't know, but was there anything you really wanted to mention? There was some

816
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,440
patent filed by Sony about some stupid electronic device that can roll up, almost like electric

817
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,440
paper, but not, I don't know.

818
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,600
Yeah, but Sony does a lot of electronic things.

819
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,720
They're saying that it's going to be used for a game system, and I say no.

820
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,280
No, Sony does a lot of electronic things.

821
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,240
Well, I heard the Wii filed a patent, Nintendo had a patent on instant messaging, and my

822
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,280
reaction was, duh.

823
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,640
You think the Wii's going to have a service kind of like Xbox Live where you can instant

824
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,640
message people?

825
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,640
Of course.

826
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,640
Of course.

827
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,640
Duh.

828
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:16,640
I didn't put it in the list for tonight. Now that would be rad. PictoChat on the internet.

829
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,520
Yeah, that would be pretty sweet. I would love to draw penises and have them seen worldwide.

830
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:27,000
Well, I was going to say for more of our UK listeners, because I'm not a huge fan of football,

831
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,680
but is this UK football or US football? Yeah, like soccer. But Love Football is available

832
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:39,300
on Japanese Xbox Live. You can download the demo. So there's actually a link on Gamers

833
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:45,780
Report it's www.gamersreport.com slash news slash 2820 and it'll teach you in case you

834
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:51,440
didn't know how to create an account a silver membership for under the Japanese territory

835
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,900
to download those demos so you can actually play that game which is kind of neat I might

836
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:00,740
have to do that and also oblivion could I do that with the just by making a new account

837
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:06,960
on my current xbox yeah I might do that also oblivion got patched and all the gold and

838
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,920
duplication glitches, as you would put it, were removed.

839
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,080
And also that patch is causing issues, freezes and whatnot.

840
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:24,760
However, there is that undocumented function that was found in the Spring 360 update to

841
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:31,240
clear your cache, and it also removes any updates that have been done on live or any

842
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:37,880
of the games so that you can actually, if you accidentally play Oblivion connected to

843
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,240
live you can un-patch it so that you can cheat in it again.

844
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,600
And the way you do that actually is pretty simple.

845
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:52,080
Under the main menu or whatever you would push, or actually going under the system blade

846
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:58,560
and then under memory you push Y on either the hard drive or the memory unit and push

847
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:05,480
x, x, left button, right button, x, x, and it'll pop up a little blade saying do you

848
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:12,920
wish to perform maintenance, yes, all your updates are gone, but basically the safe way

849
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,000
if you haven't played it and updated it yet, just unhook it from live when you're playing

850
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the game.

851
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Pretty simple.

852
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Alright.

853
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,720
We're going to go to our final story of the evening, and Loki it looks like it's yours.

854
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,720
Yes.

855
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:35,020
So, anyways, I think we remember back a couple weeks ago, we talked about Codemasters and

856
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,760
how they're basically making a game called The Turds.

857
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:44,360
Well, The Turds is actually a series, and they're being made available through a website

858
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,640
called Funsta.com.

859
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,640
When I think of turd, I don't think of fun.

860
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,640
Well, Funsta.com.

861
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,200
I think of the Playstation 3.

862
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,200
You know what?

863
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,200
I think of Taco Bell.

864
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,400
You can actually play these games right now.

865
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,800
at least one of them. Some of the wonderful games you get to play would be

866
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,080
Donkey Pong, which is gonna be

867
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,240
obviously turd-based. Now I've heard of Donkey Bong,

868
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,480
but I think that's something different. Or, no, I'm sorry, Donkey Bong...Donkey Punch,

869
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,600
I think? No, this is Donkey Pong. Forget it. Poopert.

870
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,920
Dung Beetle Rally.

871
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,640
So, wait, these guys just take games that we know and love and put poop in them?

872
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,880
That's pretty much...That's disgusting. Um, turd herders.

873
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,560
The Men in Crack, and

874
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,920
Bogger, which is available now. I equate this with the,

875
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,440
what is that, the Crazy Frog thing? That thing that sings the Axle F song?

876
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,480
That thing.

877
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,600
I equate these turd games with that thing. They have to put that

878
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,480
hideous thing in everything. Let me put it this way. Apparently it's a toy series that's in

879
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,400
the UK,

880
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,320
apparently. Why anyone would want to play with poop, but apparently

881
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:01,380
If you want to play any of these games, go to www.funsta.com, that's F-U-N-S-T-A, slash

882
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:06,340
turds, and you can actually play Bogger, which I was playing a little bit during some of

883
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:11,220
those Skype line calls, and it just plays like Frogger but it's sewer and poop based

884
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,380
and it's stupid.

885
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:20,580
You can download poo tones and wallpapers also from that website, and turd merchandise.

886
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:25,940
And they have a poo calculator to find out how much your turds are worth.

887
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,160
This by the way will be the only time that Orange Lounge Radio endorses you playing with

888
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,340
your poo.

889
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,420
But even then, we're looking at you funny.

890
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:40,340
So Funsta.com and you can check out Bogger, the rest of the games are coming out a little

891
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,340
bit later.

892
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:49,840
Was it Dung Beetle Rally June 20th, Poobert July 4th, you can play Donkey Pong and Bogger

893
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:56,640
right now and July 18th turd herders been in crack and on that note it's time

894
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,240
to end the show let's go around and get everybody's final thought my final

895
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,920
thought is I want this sinus infection to go away Loki your final thought I

896
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,760
want this pink guy to go away and dark soccer your final thought I want another

897
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:19,480
cookie reject false icons here you go no no you said you wanted it no my brain

898
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,440
telling me that I want one, I'm actually quite satisfied with these Swedish ginger cookies.

899
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,240
That's going to do it for the show, thank you guys so much for tuning in, whether you

900

we really appreciate it.

902
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,540
Hey, did you know we're only like two weeks away from our four year anniversary show?

903
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,880
Our fourth birthday party.

904
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,880
Ooh hoo.

905
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,120
Ooh hoo, we're mommy wow, we're big kids now.

906
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,480
We're out of training pants.

907
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,820
And we'll try to do something special for the four year show, although we're saving

908
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:50,080
most of the bells and whistles I think for episode 200 which should be I think

909
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,740
it's like in October or something we planned it out I don't know but stay

910
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,160
