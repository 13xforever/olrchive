Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Here it is episode number 186 for this June the 11th of 2006.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
And Loki is going to start off this set with a piece of news about the PlayStation 3.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.640
Yes, the PlayStation 3. Basically,

00:35.640 --> 00:39.080
they're saying that the early units are going to have the hardware to play the

00:39.080 --> 00:44.240
original, or the PlayStation 2 stuff. So they're going to have PlayStation 2 hardware

00:44.240 --> 00:46.360
inside to be able to play the older games.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.360
And later as time goes on and they've

00:49.360 --> 00:55.760
further finish their hardware, they're going to start emulating it via software, which

00:55.760 --> 01:00.580
good or very bad. I suppose that's one way to make sure backwards compatibility

01:00.580 --> 01:01.280
is perfect.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.800
That is one way. They did the same thing with the original

01:04.800 --> 01:08.120
PlayStation 2. The only thing is

01:08.120 --> 01:11.160
you know, I don't know,

01:11.160 --> 01:15.320
this time around though it's going to be more hardware than just one chip.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.740
But you could upscale on the original plate, like you could do the faster

01:18.740 --> 01:21.660
loading. Yeah, but the thing is they have the original chip

01:21.660 --> 01:25.200
in there to be able to do that. It's just like this is gonna have

01:25.200 --> 01:29.920
the PlayStation 2 hardware built in, but you can still upscale that.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.600
That doesn't have anything to do with it. But later on they're going to be going

01:33.600 --> 01:37.600
completely software with this. But still this means that it's going to be

01:37.600 --> 01:40.800
even more hardware crammed inside of this thing, and as it is

01:40.800 --> 01:44.200
I think they're having trouble fitting the hardware in that case. I mean

01:44.200 --> 01:48.600
it's going to end up being larger than the original Xbox by the time they're done with it.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.080
Oh, we'll see. You never know. It'll be like the size of a refrigerator or something.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.080
Yeah, remember that case that we saw before back in E3?

01:56.080 --> 02:00.080
That was a scale model. It's actually going to be a lot bigger.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.080
Alright, let's see, moving on, another story about the PlayStation 3.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.080
Watch JP had an interview with Ken Kutaragi regarding the PlayStation 3.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.080
Basically what happened is that the PlayStation 3 is,

02:12.080 --> 02:15.080
Kutaragi calls it a configuration, not a model.

02:15.080 --> 02:19.080
He says Sony wants to upgrade all aspects of the console as time goes on,

02:19.080 --> 02:22.080
like the hard drive size, maybe even the CPU specs.

02:22.080 --> 02:28.100
specs. Sony may release an upgraded version of the console every year, and

02:28.100 --> 02:31.860
Sony is really not thinking about the price or anything here. Here's the

02:31.860 --> 02:35.640
direct quote, I think it's okay to release an extended configuration every

02:35.640 --> 02:39.280
year, laugh. Though I say it like a joke, Dell will do it and Apple will do it too.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.240
In PC, if you fix the spec for two years, you'll be caught up. Computers should be

02:44.240 --> 02:48.840
changing, right? It's inevitable that 60 gigabytes will become short. Memory may

02:48.840 --> 02:53.220
become short too. There are many possibilities. So in other words, if you become an early

02:53.220 --> 02:57.140
adopter of the Playstation 3, you may get screwed on this stuff.

02:57.140 --> 03:02.660
And if they didn't... it's a console. It's not a PC. I know they're thinking it's a PC,

03:02.660 --> 03:07.100
but if it's a PC, then get into the goddamn PC market. Don't try to push this crap. It's

03:07.100 --> 03:12.360
not a fucking Vio. It's a goddamn Playstation. Well, DarkSakura might have more info here

03:12.360 --> 03:13.840
on what Sony's thinking.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.320
I just might.

03:17.320 --> 03:24.920
Basically Sony's basically going off about the hardware setup and how they're having

03:24.920 --> 03:31.800
it upgraded because basically they're, well actually didn't they try to do that before?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.200
Yeah, the PlayStation 2.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
Yeah.

03:34.200 --> 03:39.540
When they brought it out in Europe they're basically trying to push it as a computer

03:39.540 --> 03:44.760
or not as a game console, um, they were saying that basically importing game consoles into

03:44.760 --> 03:50.520
the European Union is a huge tax drain, where computers are not, so they wanted to get out

03:50.520 --> 03:54.160
of paying the taxes that they actually released Linux for the PS2.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
Huh.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
Yeah.

03:56.160 --> 04:02.800
So, um, basically, that's the theory is that they're trying to do that again, and we might

04:02.800 --> 04:04.480
even see Linux for the PS3.

04:04.480 --> 04:09.760
Well yeah, they've flaunted the Linux thing on the PlayStation 3 for everybody, so that's

04:09.760 --> 04:10.960
not a surprise at all.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.000
Just the whole concept of calling it a computer is somewhat interesting.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.480
I think it's, well here's the problem with computers and the problem if they do this.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.640
Which system do you develop?

04:19.640 --> 04:23.160
Do you develop for the one that's the weakest, or do you develop for the one that has all

04:23.160 --> 04:27.040
the new bells and whistles in it because now you're making games that don't work on the

04:27.040 --> 04:28.400
older systems.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.680
That's not good, and that's not a good thing to actually come out and say that you're gonna

04:32.680 --> 04:36.160
do when you're trying to get people to buy your system in the first place

04:36.160 --> 04:39.600
because it's you know six hundred dollars don't tell them oh yeah by the

04:39.600 --> 04:42.200
way we're gonna have one that's better that's coming out next year people

04:42.200 --> 04:46.520
aren't gonna fucking buy your damn system then so remember what we were

04:46.520 --> 04:50.320
saying about the gag order in the first half so seriously needs to shut up for a

04:50.320 --> 04:53.840
little while he does need to learn how to freaking keep their corporate mouth

04:53.840 --> 05:01.080
shut moving on let's move over to the Nintendo Wii there was some more news on

05:01.080 --> 05:03.800
virtual console this week, right Loki? Yes, that's correct.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.160
Um, actually, Nintendo president

05:07.160 --> 05:11.320
Sirot, I'm gonna mispronounce this, Satoru

05:11.320 --> 05:15.720
Iwata, um, he announced, or basically outlined the price ranges

05:15.720 --> 05:19.640
of some of the games that are gonna be on the virtual console for lease and download in

05:19.640 --> 05:24.840
Japan. Um, he says they're gonna be anywhere between 500 yen and 1000 yen

05:24.840 --> 05:30.000
and basically that, you know, is the equivalent of about $458.99 in the US.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.500
Now that won't translate exactly though I would say five and ten bucks

05:33.500 --> 05:38.200
probably to be competitive with Xbox Live. Maybe four and eight bucks you know they

05:38.200 --> 05:39.420
might try to undercut

05:39.420 --> 05:45.480
Xbox Live a little bit who knows but or do the old 99 cents you know for $4.99

05:45.480 --> 05:47.060
and $9.99 and all that stuff.

05:47.060 --> 05:50.060
You know I wouldn't see you know with some of these games like

05:50.060 --> 05:54.240
even like their first party games whatever they could really do 99 cents I

05:54.240 --> 05:54.640
mean

05:54.640 --> 05:59.240
the thing is is the Nintendo console if you put the virtual console with like

05:59.240 --> 06:03.080
thousands of items on their side I believe what happened is that the story

06:03.080 --> 06:04.060
was slightly

06:04.060 --> 06:07.800
altered later whatever there was some clarification that came out that said

06:07.800 --> 06:08.200
that

06:08.200 --> 06:11.400
this is only in regards to new stuff

06:11.400 --> 06:14.920
this is not addressed the way he's that they're gonna price the old Nintendo

06:14.920 --> 06:16.920
Entertainment System games the Super Nintendo games

06:16.920 --> 06:20.520
this is only about new things developed for the Virtual Console that's the price

06:20.520 --> 06:21.360
range they're looking at

06:21.360 --> 06:25.920
I'm telling you dude if they do 99 cents per game that's gonna be one sweet deal

06:25.920 --> 06:30.680
Or, as something I have thought of before, and I was saying this on one of the weeknight

06:30.680 --> 06:35.480
shows here on Orange Lounge Radio, I was saying it's possible that they could bundle games

06:35.480 --> 06:39.600
together, like maybe five games for five bucks, the old NES titles.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.760
You know, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, and all that stuff, put them together for one

06:43.760 --> 06:44.760
prize.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.600
But I don't know, we'll see, I suppose.

06:47.600 --> 06:54.320
Or as an added incentive to say, maybe Super Mario Galaxy, bundle in the retro Mario games

06:54.320 --> 06:55.320
with that too.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.680
Mario Super Mario Brothers 2

06:58.680 --> 07:02.000
and so on so forth.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.040
Moving on I have a story here about the Nintendo DS and the Wii

07:07.040 --> 07:12.300
having some connectivity here. Basically, well of course you know they tried to do

07:12.300 --> 07:14.680
this with the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance but it

07:14.680 --> 07:18.120
didn't really work out. However, here's some

07:18.120 --> 07:22.920
things that Iwata said that is going to basically be how the DS and Wii work together.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.680
The DS can be used as a touch screen controller for the Wii.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.720
DS software can be expanded using the Wii.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.440
The DS can access DS station services

07:34.440 --> 07:38.620
via the Wii. So we were kinda thinking that that might be one feature that you

07:38.620 --> 07:39.360
know you could

07:39.360 --> 07:43.040
download DS demos using your Wii and I think that's a kick-butt idea. It's very

07:43.040 --> 07:43.600
smart.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.880
Nintendo's got some really interesting stuff in store so we'll just

07:47.880 --> 07:49.280
have to see how it all works.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.440
you know cuz sometimes things look good on paper but they don't execute very

07:53.440 --> 07:55.880
well but this this all sounds really good I don't know how they could screw

07:55.880 --> 07:56.360
that up

07:56.360 --> 07:59.480
well on top all that stuff they had a few more things they're announcing

07:59.480 --> 08:03.080
including you know some some new stuff

08:03.080 --> 08:07.960
Pokemon battle revolution was one of the things that they announced

08:07.960 --> 08:08.920
well I have to say this

08:08.920 --> 08:13.240
GS 191 says I hope this isn't going to be as shitty as a rearview mirror

08:13.240 --> 08:17.280
yeah but Nintendo actually knows how to use their

08:17.280 --> 08:22.240
Exactly, I mean at least the stuff that they had, granted it may not have been the best

08:22.240 --> 08:27.200
stuff for the system, but it was still pretty cool to play some NES games on the Game Boy

08:27.200 --> 08:36.080
Advance when you had Animal Crossing or using it in Crystal Chronicles, stuff like that.

08:36.080 --> 08:41.920
One thing that they are mentioning though is that the price, or not the price, the release

08:41.920 --> 08:48.900
date is going to be announced before September huh so that's interesting so

08:48.900 --> 08:52.360
we'll have to wait and see I wonder why they're waiting so long maybe they maybe

08:52.360 --> 08:55.740
they still I'm starting to theorize maybe even though we've had all the

08:55.740 --> 08:59.260
speculation that we think October 18th the date and everything maybe Nintendo

08:59.260 --> 09:02.420
really still doesn't know what date they're gonna do maybe they're waiting

09:02.420 --> 09:06.180
until they're absolutely certain they can hit it and then they'll reveal it I

09:06.180 --> 09:11.740
don't know I'm just starting to wildly speculate here but maybe they feel they

09:11.740 --> 09:15.300
don't need this three-month hype going into it. They already have the hype coming off

09:15.300 --> 09:19.720
E3. They don't really need to announce, oh it's coming out, they could do it six weeks

09:19.720 --> 09:23.620
in advance and still get away with it. So who knows? Because let's say they announced

09:23.620 --> 09:27.140
the date in early September and the October 18th date turns out to be true, that would

09:27.140 --> 09:36.380
only be like six weeks. But that's enough time. Very interesting. Let's see, also Nintendo

09:36.380 --> 09:41.000
has lots in store for the DS for the rest of the year DS by the way has

09:41.000 --> 09:47.320
shipped 8.43 million units in Japan in just 18 months that's pretty interesting

09:47.320 --> 09:53.640
let's see on July 20th the company is going to release a Shabiru DSO Riori

09:53.640 --> 09:59.080
Navi it's a cooking program for the DS and then on October the company is going

09:59.080 --> 10:04.320
to release Nihon I'm gonna butcher these names so bad I apologize oh my gosh it's

10:04.320 --> 10:09.780
a huge name basically look at that you want to read that whole thing I can't

10:09.780 --> 10:20.400
see okay okay me on Joshiki riyoku can take your kai kanshu others more okay

10:20.400 --> 10:30.180
imma why he told me how can I otona no Joshiki riyoku training ds basically

10:30.180 --> 10:35.300
that is just common knowledge. It's a brain training game called Common

10:35.300 --> 10:40.300
Knowledge. They plan on releasing three to four touch generation series titles

10:40.300 --> 10:43.380
per year and of course those are the games that are designed like the brain

10:43.380 --> 10:46.140
training games and things that are really designed for the adult audience

10:46.140 --> 10:53.340
as well as kids. They're saying hardcore gamers will not be left out but there

10:53.340 --> 10:57.660
was no mention of really any new games but Iwata did mention that Final Fantasy

10:57.660 --> 11:03.660
and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are on their way. Final Fantasy III is set for an August 24th release,

11:03.660 --> 11:07.660
but again that's Japan, but I imagine the US won't be far behind. Speaking of Pokemon, Lukey.

11:07.660 --> 11:15.660
Yes, Pokemon Battle Revolution. And I'm not a huge Pokemon fan, but what's interesting about this

11:15.660 --> 11:19.660
is the fact that the graphics look a lot better than what we saw at E3 on the Wii.

11:19.660 --> 11:24.660
And that I thought was quite interesting. The game actually though looks like it's going to tie in with

11:24.660 --> 11:29.400
with the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of the new Pokemon games.

11:29.400 --> 11:38.300
As well as, suppose they use the DS as a microphone for the game as well.

11:38.300 --> 11:42.300
What looks interesting though, they actually have video up from it.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.100
It looks like Final Fantasy X battles.

11:45.100 --> 11:50.960
I mean basically just really hardcore battles and the graphics look pretty good and I'm

11:50.960 --> 11:55.120
I'm not sure if you've seen the picture yet but I mean that looks pretty damn

11:55.120 --> 11:56.360
good for a

11:56.360 --> 11:59.440
game that you know a lot better than the stuff we saw at E3.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.540
Well it just goes back to the story even we talked about the first half about the

12:02.540 --> 12:05.600
Xbox and you know they're saying they've only used 60 percent.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.800
It's the same thing with the Wii in any system you know.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.820
The very first things you see out the gate aren't going to be the system's full

12:11.820 --> 12:14.080
potential.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.480
And this game is supposed to launch in 2006.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.760
Well, that's kind of early then.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.120
Maybe the Wii's capable of even more and more and more.

12:22.120 --> 12:22.720
We'll see.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.600
I think so.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.380
All right, well, one interesting game

12:26.380 --> 12:28.080
that may be on its way out soon.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.800
Dark Sakura, you have some news on this.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.200
It's a Zelda spin-off for the DS,

12:32.200 --> 12:35.760
called Mogitate Tingle Bara Irupi Land,

12:35.760 --> 12:38.520
which translates to Fresh Tingle's Rose Colored

12:38.520 --> 12:39.400
Rupi Land.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.320
Fresh Tingles.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.560
Tingle was in Wind Waker and Majora's Mask.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.840
And also, I mentioned that Tingle actually

12:46.840 --> 12:51.640
really translates over to tinkle they just changed it because that would be really bad

12:53.080 --> 12:59.560
anyway you are uh basically carted around by this person named rupe uh

13:00.520 --> 13:04.760
i guess it's rupeji it was supposed to be old man rupee it basically tells you to

13:04.760 --> 13:10.840
uh who to maybe rupeji i guess it's written like it'd be rupeji but anyway um it has to

13:10.840 --> 13:16.680
So you have to basically collect rupees and throw them in a magic spring so you go to

13:16.680 --> 13:19.120
rupee land and you turn into Tingle.

13:19.120 --> 13:26.520
So you also get help from a fairy named Pingle who talks to you by a TV in your house.

13:26.520 --> 13:31.040
And you have to pay people and keep them happy and go through toll gates.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.940
Tingle and Pingle, this sounds like Teletubbies the game.

13:34.940 --> 13:41.940
So another title that's coming up for DS is Kaito Wario 7, guess what, WarioWare.

13:41.940 --> 13:42.940
Oh, cool.

13:42.940 --> 13:43.940
Yep.

13:43.940 --> 13:49.940
And it's by the studio that brought us F-Zero Climax on the GBA and Rhythmic Star on itoy.

13:49.940 --> 13:50.940
F-Zero Climax.

13:50.940 --> 13:53.700
Yeah, F-Zero will make you.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.700
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win!

13:55.700 --> 13:56.700
Oh!

13:56.700 --> 14:02.820
Alright, moving on, Loki, let's get into some political-oriented news, Loki.

14:02.820 --> 14:03.820
Yes.

14:03.820 --> 14:07.540
Clinton opened her big fat mouth and she basically said that the federal

14:07.540 --> 14:11.260
government needs to step in to ensure that electronic media including video

14:11.260 --> 14:17.100
games isn't harming children's development and what she's basically

14:17.100 --> 14:24.140
suggesting is that they approve a federal funded research program into the

14:24.140 --> 14:27.820
effects or broad effects of media from everything from television to video

14:27.820 --> 14:34.780
games to the internet on children. What she needs to research is a way that parents do

14:34.780 --> 14:41.260
their fucking job. And she also needs to research her goddamn new platform to be, you know,

14:41.260 --> 14:45.380
bitching about. Cause I don't like it. Well you know what's interesting here now, if you

14:45.380 --> 14:49.260
read a little further down in the story it says there's a quote from Clinton that says

14:49.260 --> 14:54.380
obviously parents are on the front line but a lot of them need help. Very interesting

14:54.380 --> 14:55.380
quote there.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.380
Parents do not need goddamn help.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.380
You could put...

14:57.380 --> 14:59.460
Hold on, I want to point this out too.

14:59.460 --> 15:03.480
This statement, by the way, came just like hours before the House of Representatives

15:03.480 --> 15:09.100
made that indecency fine increase, $32,500 up to $325,000.

15:09.100 --> 15:15.220
That was a 379 to 35 vote in the House.

15:15.220 --> 15:21.060
You know what, it's not the place of our government to be sticking their nose into how parents

15:21.060 --> 15:22.620
do their job.

15:22.620 --> 15:26.500
need to actually be the ones to do their job and if you're not ready to do that

15:26.500 --> 15:29.740
job don't have the children we mean they don't understand how to do their job

15:29.740 --> 15:32.860
there's a goddamn reading system that tells them what it's appropriate for

15:32.860 --> 15:37.700
what age what kind of content is in said product and there's also parental

15:37.700 --> 15:42.620
controls on your console systems mean how much more do I need to go over there

15:42.620 --> 15:46.920
wipe their ass for them too because it's apparently oh I'm so helpless I can't

15:46.920 --> 15:51.100
possibly monitor what my kid sees you know there's reading systems and

15:51.100 --> 15:55.220
everything this has been done it's just the parents are too goddamn lazy to do

15:55.220 --> 16:02.580
this and then when something bad happens I'm gonna sue for lots of money now so

16:02.580 --> 16:06.940
you know that's basically what it comes down to the parents are retarded and

16:06.940 --> 16:13.140
then they get paid for being retarded Thank You America rewarding the retarded

16:13.140 --> 16:17.340
all right speaking of people not this just keeps going speaking of people not

16:17.340 --> 16:25.260
doing their jobs and guess what one of the judges in the John a Gotti jr. trial

16:25.260 --> 16:31.540
was doing well I already know the answer but I'll act surprised basically he was

16:31.540 --> 16:39.860
playing solitaire well was it a she yes it was trying to find the name Shira

16:39.860 --> 16:47.220
Sheindlin Wow who was a playing a solitaire during the trial well basically

16:47.220 --> 16:56.180
while I'm trying to see who the name was I think it was Curtis still one of the

16:56.180 --> 17:00.940
guardian angels from it's the one the anti-crime groups basically was

17:00.940 --> 17:06.940
testifying and the judge was playing solitaire Wow and you know I never like

17:06.940 --> 17:12.180
Like until I had jury duty, I always thought the judge just kind of sat there and just

17:12.180 --> 17:16.500
kind of watched everything going on, but the judge really is doing other stuff while people

17:16.500 --> 17:17.500
are there testifying.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.500
And the judge will just kind of, like when the judge, like when one of the lawyers yells

17:20.500 --> 17:23.900
objection, that's when the judge kind of looks over and will look at the last few things

17:23.900 --> 17:25.580
said and then make a ruling.

17:25.580 --> 17:28.760
Like otherwise the judge, I don't know if he's doing emails or looking up law things

17:28.760 --> 17:31.900
on the internet or maybe playing solitaire, I don't know, I doubt he is, he seems like

17:31.900 --> 17:32.900
a really smart guy.

17:32.900 --> 17:33.900
Poor no.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.900
It's interesting what the judges could possibly get away with.

17:37.900 --> 17:42.900
I mean, if I hadn't done jury duty this week, I would have never imagined that this could be humanly possible.

17:42.900 --> 17:52.900
There's an interesting quote here from Cilla basically comparing the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg firing a city worker for playing solitaire at the desk.

17:52.900 --> 18:00.900
To quote, should a federal judge be playing video solitaire when an employee of the New York City government gets fired for playing video solitaire?

18:00.900 --> 18:05.220
I don't think any of us are that good at multitasking. To me, it's an abuse and an outrage.

18:05.220 --> 18:08.780
Honestly, you know,

18:08.780 --> 18:12.300
there's a type- I'm gonna point out something- not everyone's aware of this-

18:12.300 --> 18:16.100
there is a type of learning called kinesthetic learning.

18:16.100 --> 18:20.500
What this means is that you learn better while you were doing other things, when

18:20.500 --> 18:22.040
you have something else pulling your attention.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.580
Um, actually, we did this at work, we did a study on this at work,

18:25.580 --> 18:29.020
where we were given, uh, like toys.

18:29.020 --> 18:33.420
like you know Legos and stuff to do while we were at one of our training classes and

18:33.880 --> 18:37.560
At least half of the class actually retain the knowledge in our training class better

18:37.960 --> 18:42.460
So I you know a lot of times when when you know, I have to listen to something

18:42.460 --> 18:49.140
I'm doodling a I doodle in class, you know people some people learn or actually I would say pay attention

18:49.960 --> 18:53.540
Better when they've got something else going on something that is you know

18:53.540 --> 18:59.300
when they keep one I guess one of their senses occupied be it you know in a

18:59.300 --> 19:03.380
playing solitaire that you know they'll be able to better listen I mean there

19:03.380 --> 19:06.720
are people that are just like that and on top of that you know I would rather

19:06.720 --> 19:10.640
have a judge that's good at multitasking than having someone that can only focus

19:10.640 --> 19:14.320
on one thing at one time and on top of that it's also proven that people who

19:14.320 --> 19:19.220
play video games are better have a better understanding for complex

19:19.220 --> 19:22.200
situations it almost sounds like you're okay with her playing solitaire I am

19:22.200 --> 19:23.200
I'm okay with it.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.200
It's funny.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.200
What's the point?

19:25.200 --> 19:28.000
I can play solitaire and freaking listen to a lecture.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.720
I used to do that in class when I would bring my laptop up and play solitaire during my

19:31.720 --> 19:35.400
class and I got an A in the damn class.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.280
I used to play Doom in my Mac lab class.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.480
It's just an interesting perspective, that's all I can say.

19:40.480 --> 19:45.200
I think they should be fired because solitaire is not a god damn game.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.200
It's just cards.

19:46.200 --> 19:51.880
And the fact that you have a game on a computer with cards, that's solitaire is retarded.

19:51.880 --> 19:57.000
is so last century i have to read the comments in our chatroom orange lounge radio.com click

19:57.000 --> 20:02.820
on chat uh ssj100 matt says they should be playing phoenix right more is making the obvious

20:02.820 --> 20:08.040
joke there uh blaze says the judge does not watch porn loki judges are heavily involved

20:08.040 --> 20:16.300
and can actually swing a trial for or against the prosecution defense anyway moving right

20:16.300 --> 20:21.060
along loki you have uh some more political oriented news yeah as if this is a big surprise

20:21.060 --> 20:22.860
Because the ASA is going to sue Minnesota.

20:22.860 --> 20:23.860
And why are they suing them?

20:23.860 --> 20:29.500
Of course, because of the recent law that they passed that would fine kids $25 for buying

20:29.500 --> 20:33.360
or renting M or adult rated games.

20:33.360 --> 20:39.360
And basically, you know, they said that this is definitely costing taxpayers a lot of money

20:39.360 --> 20:43.500
for a law that they can't really enforce in the first place.

20:43.500 --> 20:49.420
And they said, and I quote, the bill has tortured effort to end the run of the first amendment

20:49.420 --> 20:54.580
by punishing kids directly fails under the Constitution because children have rights

20:54.580 --> 20:59.720
under the First Amendment like of all other citizens. The state is attempting to impose

20:59.720 --> 21:05.640
liability on children because they know that the courts have constantly held that they

21:05.640 --> 21:10.340
cannot penalize retailers. We believe that the courts will agree that fighting children

21:10.340 --> 21:16.800
violates the First Amendment as well. And if this law is implemented, it will not only

21:16.800 --> 21:21.560
limit the First Amendment rights for Minnesota residents. It will create a huge amount of

21:21.560 --> 21:27.320
confusion for retailers, parents, and children. I'm confident that the court will affirm our

21:27.320 --> 21:32.720
position given the ruling on similar statutes in other jurisdictions. And here's my problem

21:32.720 --> 21:36.280
with the whole thing is why the hell did this law get passed in the first place? They don't

21:36.280 --> 21:42.880
have similar laws for R-rated movies or NC-17 movies. It's fine for kids to see that stuff

21:42.880 --> 21:46.840
and that's more lifelike than games so what the hell this is

21:46.840 --> 21:51.440
stupid it's really stupid and it will probably get overturned anyway so

21:51.440 --> 21:54.480
whatever.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.760
Moving on to another state and their political news Louisiana

21:58.760 --> 22:02.040
the Senate has unanimously passed a bill

22:02.040 --> 22:06.280
that had a lot of involvement by he who shall not be named on this program

22:06.280 --> 22:06.800
anymore

22:06.800 --> 22:11.040
the media horn if you don't know who we're talking about his name rhymes with

22:11.040 --> 22:16.080
Mr. Fuckompson... Jackass.

22:16.080 --> 22:21.080
Yeah. Anyway, so let's see here. Basically what happened is that

22:21.080 --> 22:24.080
the measure was

22:24.080 --> 22:27.640
written by he who shall not be named. Actually, no I'm sorry.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.560
Oh, it's a co-author. He's a co-author involved in this here.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.360
It was written by Representative Roy Burrell

22:35.360 --> 22:39.000
and he was just a co-author on it. It's HB 1381

22:39.000 --> 22:43.400
and it makes it illegal to sell rent or lease a game to a minor if it meets

22:43.400 --> 22:44.580
three conditions.

22:44.580 --> 22:49.580
If the average person would think appeals to the minor's morbid entrance

22:49.580 --> 22:50.360
in violence

22:50.360 --> 22:54.840
or if it depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to

22:54.840 --> 22:56.200
prevailing standards

22:56.200 --> 23:00.260
and the game also qualifies if it lacks serious literary,

23:00.260 --> 23:03.640
artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

23:03.640 --> 23:07.200
Violators could be fined between a hundred and two thousand dollars and sentenced

23:07.200 --> 23:10.240
up to 12 months in a state prison. What a bunch of horseshit.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.600
I mean, where's the checks here?

23:13.600 --> 23:17.760
I hate these vague, vague laws that people are coming up with. Where is the check?

23:17.760 --> 23:21.400
Who determines if a game lacks

23:21.400 --> 23:25.760
serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors?

23:25.760 --> 23:28.320
It's not the government's job to

23:28.320 --> 23:34.080
to rate art. Though that same description, it actually does go into

23:34.080 --> 23:38.160
free speech right because that actually is one of the defining rights for what allows free speech

23:38.160 --> 23:43.360
and what doesn't. They're basically, they're basically trying to manipulate the constitution

23:44.240 --> 23:48.720
into applying it toward video games instead of saying, oh well you're denying us our free

23:48.720 --> 23:54.400
speech right, trying to make it fall under what's allowable free speech. It's the same thing. Let

23:54.400 --> 24:00.960
me look at the first amendment. No, I actually, I want to, I want to, uh, I want to hear this, uh,

24:00.960 --> 24:05.280
First Amendment passage here. Let's see here, I'll read some more here.

24:05.280 --> 24:09.040
It was approved by a key committee last week, HB 1381.

24:09.040 --> 24:13.320
It was passed the other day in a 35 to nothing vote

24:13.320 --> 24:17.440
in the Louisiana State Senate. It now is going to go to

24:17.440 --> 24:19.920
Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco,

24:19.920 --> 24:23.200
Governor of Louisiana, and of course the governor is expected to sign the bill

24:23.200 --> 24:24.800
because of the unanimous vote

24:24.800 --> 24:28.680
and the recent linking of games and teenage murder suspects in the Louisiana

24:28.680 --> 24:29.280
media.

24:29.280 --> 24:33.160
and of course you can expect that the ESA will have a problem with this and file

24:33.160 --> 24:36.920
a lawsuit immediately. Any luck?

24:36.920 --> 24:41.120
Well, I'm trying to find it because basically it's a matter of court

24:41.120 --> 24:42.760
interpretation because we went over this

24:42.760 --> 24:46.680
in my law class, some of my law classes that I've taken.

24:46.680 --> 24:51.080
I mean basically just looking through this, we've been dealing with this

24:51.080 --> 24:55.120
since the, you know, country, you know, was created.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.560
Looking on here there's also a note on here

24:58.560 --> 25:03.000
that basically they can punish words

25:03.000 --> 25:05.520
that by their very nature invoke danger

25:05.520 --> 25:07.540
to the public peace and to the security of the state.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.500
That's one of the things listed.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.340
I'm trying to find the word.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.880
I got, here it is, on Wikipedia, on original Wikipedia.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.460
Here's the exact text right here, yep.

25:15.460 --> 25:19.040
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment

25:19.040 --> 25:22.320
of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

25:22.320 --> 25:25.280
or abridging the freedom of speech or the press

25:25.280 --> 25:28.120
or the right of the people peaceably to assemble

25:28.120 --> 25:35.120
and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

25:35.740 --> 25:36.480
I'm trying to...

25:36.480 --> 25:39.640
there was... there were a number of cases, though, where they

25:39.640 --> 25:44.380
brought that in under... here it is, obscenity.

25:44.380 --> 25:47.400
The federal government... just to go... I'm quoting Wikipedia, basically. The federal

25:47.400 --> 25:50.520
government in the states have long permitted to restrict obscene and pornographic

25:50.520 --> 25:51.240
speech.

25:51.240 --> 25:54.240
While obscene speech generally has no protection under the First Amendment,

25:54.240 --> 25:56.880
pornography is subject to little regulation.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.560
the exact definition of obscenity and pornography has changed over time.

26:00.960 --> 26:05.140
And basically, I really recommend that people go on Wikipedia and read this.

26:05.140 --> 26:11.960
I mean, there's a lot of stuff here, but they're basically saying in Miller versus California

26:11.960 --> 26:17.140
in 1973, a work is obscene if it, and this is basically what's referred to as the Miller test,

26:17.140 --> 26:20.620
which is where the basis of that law in Louisiana,

26:20.840 --> 26:25.120
a work is obscene if it would be found appealing to the prurient interest

26:25.120 --> 26:28.180
by an average person applying contemporary community standards

26:28.180 --> 26:31.220
depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and has no

26:31.220 --> 26:35.060
serious literary, artistic, and political or scientific value." So basically they're

26:35.060 --> 26:35.800
taking

26:35.800 --> 26:39.720
what they've applied to movies and applying it to video games.

26:39.720 --> 26:43.780
Okay, let's just take this even a step further than that. Okay, let's punish people for not

26:43.780 --> 26:44.640
sharing

26:44.640 --> 26:49.580
because basically, you know, right here you're taking the parents responsibility for

26:49.580 --> 26:50.900
deciding whether kids need,

26:50.900 --> 26:56.260
you know, can see, let's go ahead and have the government step in for their

26:56.260 --> 27:00.980
other jobs like making sure that the kids share their toys with their

27:00.980 --> 27:02.860
brothers and sisters. And I think we should find the kids

27:02.860 --> 27:06.680
that do not share their toys and we should also basically

27:06.680 --> 27:10.100
enact communism all over again because this is pretty much

27:10.100 --> 27:14.860
what they kinda want to do anyways. Wow. It's retarded!

27:14.860 --> 27:18.860
Retarded. Moving on, now the ESRB has a

27:18.860 --> 27:22.280
perfectly fine rating system out there it just seems like people aren't aware

27:22.280 --> 27:23.440
of it so Loki

27:23.440 --> 27:28.200
steps taken to try and promote the ESRB system? Exactly and Penny Arcade as we

27:28.200 --> 27:29.120
mentioned before

27:29.120 --> 27:34.000
is working on ads for the ESRB and some of these were actually kinda shown

27:34.000 --> 27:37.020
a little bit at E3 and they've actually unveiled

27:37.020 --> 27:40.100
a couple of them so far and they look pretty good they've just got a character

27:40.100 --> 27:43.160
with text written around the outside and for example

27:43.160 --> 27:46.220
I'm gonna pull up one here for Sarah

27:46.220 --> 27:49.440
one of the ones advertising the E-rating.

27:49.440 --> 27:54.140
It says, because Sarah plays video games, there is a group of people making sure

27:54.140 --> 27:56.260
that the games she plays are rated.

27:56.260 --> 27:59.940
They're called the Entertainment Software Ratings Board,

27:59.940 --> 28:04.960
but that's just the long way of saying it. Usually it's called

28:04.960 --> 28:09.660
the ESRB. They check

28:09.660 --> 28:13.160
games to help

28:13.160 --> 28:17.640
make sure it's hard to read. It's hard to read because it goes around the girl, huh?

28:17.640 --> 28:20.660
I don't know. That might be something in the ad. To make sure it's

28:20.660 --> 28:23.920
right for you, your older brother, mom and dad, anybody.

28:23.920 --> 28:27.240
Somebody's got to do it, and they're the ones that do.

28:27.240 --> 28:32.000
So it's basically an ad saying, you know what, this is being done.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.320
And the same thing's being done with film. I don't understand.

28:35.320 --> 28:39.200
Okay, they've done it in the past. They've gone after

28:39.200 --> 28:42.880
movies and stuff, but still though,

28:42.880 --> 28:46.560
it's the same thing it's media just because it's interactive big

28:46.560 --> 28:49.600
deal you know big deal if it's interactive but it doesn't

28:49.600 --> 28:54.920
it's still the same thing I mean I can go watch you know kung fu movie when I

28:54.920 --> 28:58.480
you know kick the crap out of people afterwards it's the same damn thing

28:58.480 --> 29:02.000
so I don't know why they're not attacking all media at the same time

29:02.000 --> 29:05.400
alright moving on we're speaking of promotion

29:05.400 --> 29:08.680
the ESRB trying to promote their rating systems there we like to promote good

29:08.680 --> 29:10.400
websites on this program don't we

29:10.400 --> 29:14.880
DarkSakura? Sure do. And DarkSakura is the queen of the internet. She surfs the

29:14.880 --> 29:16.160
internet up and down and

29:16.160 --> 29:20.120
finds a website that she would like to share with you guys in her website of

29:20.120 --> 29:22.640
the week. So DarkSakura, where should the kids be going this week?

29:22.640 --> 29:27.400
Well, I talked about them last week

29:27.400 --> 29:30.760
because I'd had a really good experience actually doing

29:30.760 --> 29:34.440
business with the business side of the site. But I wanted to actually promote the forums at

29:34.440 --> 29:35.520
junkyspot.com

29:35.520 --> 29:39.040
It's J-U-N-K-Y spot.com

29:39.040 --> 29:43.940
For anyone who's basically getting into it, like I've been getting into the dollies, the

29:43.940 --> 29:48.400
model dollies where you customize everything, I swear I found more information on their

29:48.400 --> 29:52.780
forums than I have anywhere else in the entirety of the internet.

29:52.780 --> 29:57.500
On top of that, it's a good place for communication for anybody who's into that.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.280
I've had nothing but a good experience there.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.280
Everyone's friendly.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.280
It's like I haven't even seen...

30:02.280 --> 30:06.700
It's the only forum I've ever been to that I haven't seen any flaming at all on.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.260
Is there going to be anything for me if I'm not into dollies?

30:09.260 --> 30:10.260
No.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.260
No.

30:11.260 --> 30:14.260
But I've talked to a few of our listeners who have gotten into it.

30:14.260 --> 30:21.940
So I figured, you know, this is my, this has to be my side of the week, that's fine.

30:21.940 --> 30:26.300
But also though there are actually some good painting tips though.

30:26.300 --> 30:31.300
I mean a lot of these my husband was saying yeah that applies to model cars too.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.100
Ok fair enough.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.180
So I'm being girly ok?

30:35.180 --> 30:39.540
If you like to dress up your models in Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, maybe you want

30:39.540 --> 30:40.540
to dress up a dolly.

30:40.540 --> 30:41.540
I've seen some.

30:41.540 --> 30:48.080
There's people who have made, who have done basically cosplay doll-fies, where they've

30:48.080 --> 30:51.140
actually made characters from different games.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.140
Wow.

30:52.140 --> 30:53.620
I think it's pretty cool.

30:53.620 --> 30:57.820
Now that could be interesting, dolls based off of, you know, the characters.

30:57.820 --> 30:59.780
People would make those and sell them for tons of money at conventions.

30:59.780 --> 31:04.260
You can actually buy, though, pre-done, you know, they're made by different companies,

31:04.260 --> 31:09.940
like they've actually started releasing I think they're the the cool girls line

31:09.940 --> 31:12.800
I'm trying to remember I think it's Takara that puts it out they have a cutie

31:12.800 --> 31:19.580
honey and they have a Kusanagi or is it whatever her name is from Ghost in the

31:19.580 --> 31:24.140
Shell they have a doll for that and a lot of different places but it was kind

31:24.140 --> 31:28.460
of a weird little niche thing it's a hobby I picked up while I was you know

31:28.460 --> 31:35.140
out of work, but it's it's a good good informative place. All right, going back

31:35.140 --> 31:40.100
into some gaming news. Loki, some news in the Street Fighter world. Yes, and it's

31:40.100 --> 31:44.780
it's interesting, kind of a rumor at the point right now, but it says according to

31:44.780 --> 31:52.420
the website snk-capcom.com, a DC versus Street Fighter game may be indeed

31:52.420 --> 31:56.820
in the works, and they're confirmed or they've confirmed with both parties at

31:56.820 --> 32:02.640
this year's E3 that the legalities of the game were being considered and it'd be

32:02.640 --> 32:05.520
pretty interesting that they came out with that. Now you might remember they

32:05.520 --> 32:10.080
used to do like a Marvel versus Capcom and Marvel versus Street Fighter so DC

32:10.080 --> 32:13.080
versus Street Fighter would be kind of cool although I think Superman would kick

32:13.080 --> 32:17.820
everyone's ass in that so I don't know. It'd be interesting to see. Superman versus

32:17.820 --> 32:22.860
like Chun-Li I think he's gonna beat her ass. We'll see. Just a little bit there.

32:22.860 --> 32:26.300
She might have kryptonite panties on, you never know.

32:26.300 --> 32:30.580
Alright, now this is very interesting if you're a Final Fantasy fan

32:30.580 --> 32:33.540
certainly you're anticipating Final Fantasy 13 and this is why the

32:33.540 --> 32:36.900
PlayStation 3 is still cool for some people because Final Fantasy 13

32:36.900 --> 32:41.020
looks to be pretty ass-kicking and Advent Children actually is inspiring

32:41.020 --> 32:44.940
Final Fantasy 13 somewhat, not maybe directly but you know

32:44.940 --> 32:48.540
while the DVD kinda got some mixed reviews from people,

32:48.540 --> 32:52.380
it has some great kick-butt battle sequences in the movie like some really

32:52.380 --> 32:53.380
fast pacing.

32:53.380 --> 32:55.360
You guys have probably seen this in the trailer.

32:55.360 --> 33:00.140
Well this is interesting because Final Fantasy 13's director, Motomo Toriyama, said,

33:00.140 --> 33:05.020
Final Fantasy 13 attempts to see how far it's possible to make Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children's

33:05.020 --> 33:06.860
battles into a game.

33:06.860 --> 33:10.420
Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children is a video production and it showed us battles that have

33:10.420 --> 33:12.980
not been achievable in Final Fantasy so far.

33:12.980 --> 33:17.980
With Final Fantasy 13, we're focusing on how far we can realize the video.

33:17.980 --> 33:21.960
So that might be a pretty sweet game, imagining you're getting to control some of those battle

33:21.960 --> 33:25.040
Sequences that'll be that'll sell some PlayStation threes

33:25.540 --> 33:32.500
That'll that'll get the Sony family coming out until next year way late next year if even that now will be in Japan

33:32.500 --> 33:37.480
I mean how long did Final Fantasy 12 take to come out? Oh my gosh, and it's still not out here exactly

33:37.480 --> 33:39.920
I I would say I I don't even think we're gonna get it next year

33:39.920 --> 33:46.500
I would say we will have Final Fantasy 13 Christmas 2008. I would anticipate but you know, what do I know?

33:46.500 --> 33:48.500
I'm just some guy on the internet

33:48.500 --> 33:52.020
Loki, you have some news regarding online games.

33:52.020 --> 33:55.300
Yeah, actually the online game market's huge. How huge?

33:55.300 --> 33:58.980
They're estimating it's going to reach 13 billion dollars by the

33:58.980 --> 34:02.820
year 2011 and of course this is

34:02.820 --> 34:06.700
you know a lot in part for games such as World of Warcraft

34:06.700 --> 34:11.380
and you know Everquests and whatnot but I'm just basically,

34:11.380 --> 34:14.700
even nowadays you see tons of MMOs coming around

34:14.700 --> 34:18.280
that's just the way everything's kinda headed nowadays and even like Xbox Live

34:18.280 --> 34:22.760
arcade and a lot of online games everything's really just heading online

34:22.760 --> 34:28.100
so it's no wonder that it's gonna be that big and I wouldn't be surprised if

34:28.100 --> 34:33.440
it hits 13 billion even sooner than that I mean that's kind of a you know being

34:33.440 --> 34:40.120
safe when it comes to big it doesn't get much bigger than World of Warcraft and

34:40.120 --> 34:43.200
you know there was a story we talked about on this program probably like

34:43.200 --> 34:49.060
Like three or four months ago, we were talking about this guy, Brian Kopp, who'd been sued

34:49.060 --> 34:54.140
by Blizzard Entertainment because he put out the book that he was selling on eBay and it

34:54.140 --> 34:55.300
had the maps and things.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.300
Remember that?

34:56.300 --> 34:57.300
You remember we kind of got into that?

34:57.300 --> 34:58.300
Well, guess what?

34:58.300 --> 35:01.060
Blizzard dropped the lawsuit.

35:01.060 --> 35:03.520
So that's pretty much all there is to say.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.320
There was basically a settlement.

35:05.320 --> 35:10.180
There was no monetary compensation for Kopp and basically the companies agreed to withdraw

35:10.180 --> 35:15.100
their previous takedown notices and drop all the infringement claims, and also it

35:15.100 --> 35:18.580
was said they'd refrain from filing any future takedown notices against the same

35:18.580 --> 35:24.180
items COP has already disputed through counter notices. COP, by the way, will

35:24.180 --> 35:28.780
be retaining the book's disclaimers about its unofficial nature, and he won't

35:28.780 --> 35:33.020
include links or instructions on how to locate cheats in the game, so it's

35:33.020 --> 35:36.100
strictly a strategy guide without endorsing cheating, so a little bit of

35:36.100 --> 35:42.220
compromise on both sides. And that's good. I think it's good that they compromised

35:42.220 --> 35:44.980
and worked it out and didn't have to, you know, go to trial and all that messy

35:44.980 --> 35:50.700
stuff. Anyway, we're gonna head on over to our Skype line. It's www.orangelaungeradio.com.

35:50.700 --> 35:55.020

35:59.380 --> 36:02.820
toll call for most people. So please, if you don't own the phone line or pay the

36:08.320 --> 36:12.080
phone call coming in so I'm gonna go ahead and pick that up hello you're on

36:12.080 --> 36:17.040
orange lounge radio hi sky it's me Ravens dolphin hello Ravens dolphin

36:17.040 --> 36:22.280
what's on your mind I just picked up the DS light ah yes the DS lights are out

36:22.280 --> 36:27.200
today what do you think I love it yeah what's so what's so great about it tell

36:27.200 --> 36:31.280
me I don't know if I'm totally sold on the DS light yet tell me why I need to

36:31.280 --> 36:36.920
get this when I already have the DS you know fat all right all right just for

36:36.920 --> 36:42.760
one reason this thing has brighter screens you I'm not saying this just

36:42.760 --> 36:48.040
because when I turn this thing on I notice a big difference from the

36:48.040 --> 36:55.640
original hmm there's colors I haven't seen before what about the claims that

36:55.640 --> 37:00.840
it's a little more uncomfortable to play it is yeah it's kind of like the PSP

37:00.840 --> 37:04.520
Have you tried playing Metroid Prime on it? Yes, I have.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.760
And it's a world of difference. Is it better?

37:07.760 --> 37:11.960
Yeah, it's much better. Interesting, because that game's kind of hard to play on the DS

37:11.960 --> 37:12.400
fat.

37:12.400 --> 37:16.720
It sure is. I don't know what else to call it. There's the DS

37:16.720 --> 37:19.800
Heavy. I like the DS Fat. The DS Fatty.

37:19.800 --> 37:23.600
I like crappy. It's not crappy.

37:23.600 --> 37:28.040
DS is a good system. It's just a little fat. I like the light better.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.480
Alright, oh

37:29.480 --> 37:35.340
What about now here? Here's somebody in our here's somebody in our chat room here a VX Jason XV says brighter is totally unnecessary

37:36.380 --> 37:41.920
What do you say to that? I don't see much ari masen says I got my DS light today

37:41.920 --> 37:45.520
I love its death brightness setting the red is more redder now

37:46.240 --> 37:51.120
Yeah, like I like fourth is death and you know, and oh, can I say something? Yeah

37:51.120 --> 37:57.400
All right, I stand in line for three minutes for a DS light. No one was at my ebb store

37:58.360 --> 38:01.720
Well, there hasn't been a whole lot of promotion leading up to launch day

38:01.720 --> 38:05.800
I think it's something Nintendo just kind of wants out there and it's gonna be circulating

38:05.800 --> 38:10.000
I don't think there there was really a huge push for a stellar launch for this

38:10.520 --> 38:16.520
So yeah, but in Japan people have been waiting in line for days to get a DS

38:16.520 --> 38:22.480
Well, that's everybody else's important one. They stand in line for Dragon Quest too, yet here nobody cares, although they should.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.080
Yeah, but they at least Dragon Quest on a Sunday or a Saturday.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.220
Alright. Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

38:33.160 --> 38:38.500
But, uh, don't support Sony. Well, we'll see. Amen. They, you know what?

38:39.440 --> 38:46.200
Things can change. I realize the world is anti Sony right now, but Devil's Advocate, you guys, Sony might say something

38:46.200 --> 38:50.360
it's gonna win you back all right we'll see all right Ravenstaufen have a good

38:50.360 --> 38:54.440

39:19.680 --> 39:22.160
Okay, go ahead and rant for a little bit.

39:22.160 --> 39:27.200
Put the microphone a little bit closer, but not as close as it was before, and then rant.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.200
Okay.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.280
I hate Final Fantasy.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.840
Why?

39:31.840 --> 39:39.840
I have played it, I do not like it, I respect people who like it, but I do not like it.

just kind of weird

40:03.120 --> 40:04.280
not too original

40:04.280 --> 40:08.520
okay now what kind of games do you like

40:08.520 --> 40:11.340
it could just be because I'm into the action games.

40:11.340 --> 40:14.320
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking here is that maybe you're just not the type of

40:14.320 --> 40:17.000
person that plays role-playing games. Like, I

40:17.000 --> 40:20.920
love, or I love these Final Fantasy games, most of them, some of them were

40:20.920 --> 40:21.540
stupid,

40:21.540 --> 40:27.040
like eight, but, you know, I don't care for sports games.

40:27.040 --> 40:30.440
And, you know, I realize why sports games are out there, and there's some pretty

40:30.440 --> 40:34.460
good sports games out there if you're into those types of games, but for me,

40:34.460 --> 40:36.520
I don't really play sports games. I don't enjoy them.

40:36.520 --> 40:39.320
So that's just kind of the type of game I'm not into.

40:39.320 --> 40:43.340
So I'm cool with you not liking Final Fantasy as long as you still have respect for people

40:43.340 --> 40:46.880
that are into it, because I respect people that play sports titles.

40:46.880 --> 40:53.160
And also, and I thank you for respecting it, but I've had many people say, you suck, you

40:53.160 --> 40:54.160
suck!

40:54.160 --> 40:56.000
Final Fantasy rules, you suck!

40:56.000 --> 41:00.440
Well just, instead of this, try a different approach.

41:00.440 --> 41:04.820
Instead next time, knocking on Final Fantasy, tell your friends about the games you do like

41:04.820 --> 41:11.220
and make them play those games okay less hate more love get it and also as I

41:11.220 --> 41:15.780
know as you may have noticed I tried it before I judged all right well that's

41:15.780 --> 41:21.660
good that I can respect one map for hate or that I can I will not mention all

41:21.660 --> 41:25.420
right all right we're gonna let you go buddy we got more calls coming in but

41:25.420 --> 41:32.220
thanks for the call okay all right later all right let's take another call here

41:32.220 --> 41:35.220
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

41:35.220 --> 41:38.220
Hi, this is the Amplidude.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.220
Hello.

41:39.220 --> 41:40.220
I'm just calling in.

41:40.220 --> 41:42.220
Hi Amplidude, what's on your mind?

41:42.220 --> 41:46.220
Just calling in. I didn't get to listen to much of the show besides the past 10 minutes.

41:46.220 --> 41:55.220
But as the last caller, Final Fantasy, if you don't like any of them, at least you should give 5 a chance.

41:55.220 --> 41:57.220
That was my favorite one.

41:57.220 --> 42:00.220
5? You know what? I disagree because 5 is great.

42:00.220 --> 42:06.160
Five is great, but five is also the most complicated and it's the most like hardcore role-playing one out of them

42:06.160 --> 42:10.560
I think it's just my opinion. I think five would have the reverse effect

42:10.560 --> 42:13.200
I think he would dislike five more than any of the others

42:13.200 --> 42:17.560
But see you and Dark Sakura and even me we already like Final Fantasy

42:17.560 --> 42:20.100
So Final Fantasy 5 is just more of a good thing

42:20.100 --> 42:23.700
But when you don't like role-playing games to begin with Final Fantasy 5 is gonna be more of a bad thing

42:24.220 --> 42:27.420
all right, I just like the job system, that's what a

42:27.420 --> 42:34.420
10-2. A lot of people didn't like it, but I at least liked how they tried to bring back the job system.

42:34.420 --> 42:47.420
Yeah, 10-2 was a nod right back to that, except one thing I liked about 5 is that you could combine basically your character classes to create, you know, you have a white mage and then you have a fighter, you have a paladin basically.

42:47.420 --> 42:48.420
Yeah.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.420
What other types of games do you like, AmpliDude?

42:50.420 --> 42:55.420
Pretty much all RPGs. I was just playing BeatMania not too long ago before I called.

42:55.420 --> 42:57.420
US one or Japanese one?

42:57.420 --> 42:59.420
Uh, seventh Japanese.

42:59.420 --> 43:01.420
Okay, that's one of the styles I don't own.

43:01.420 --> 43:03.420
Because I took a break from BeatMania for a little while.

43:03.420 --> 43:05.420
I skipped that one.

43:05.420 --> 43:07.420
No, I didn't. I have seventh style.

43:07.420 --> 43:09.420
Seventh has some of my favorite music in it.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.420
No, I have seventh style. I didn't get ninth and up.

43:11.420 --> 43:13.420
I might need to borrow some of those from you at some point.

43:13.420 --> 43:15.420
If I ever get mine back from George.

43:15.420 --> 43:17.420
Ah, I see.

43:17.420 --> 43:19.420
That's cool. BeatMania is a good time. Have you played Red yet?

43:19.420 --> 43:21.420
Oh, yeah.

43:21.420 --> 43:23.420
I actually left it at home, so I had to deal with seven.

43:23.420 --> 43:25.420
2007 but 11 is

43:25.780 --> 43:32.560
Awesome. It's it's a beautiful setup. I need to play more of it. I absolutely do any other thoughts for our listeners amplitude

43:33.100 --> 43:35.100
um, well my

43:35.500 --> 43:42.040
Friends girlfriend brought over a DS light today. It's pretty kick-ass. I have to say what are the Reds indeed redder?

43:42.820 --> 43:43.900
um

43:43.900 --> 43:48.300
It's a lot brighter. Yeah, it feels a lot different than I would

43:48.300 --> 43:53.280
uh expected like I expected it to feel a lot different than it did but is it

43:53.280 --> 43:58.180
worth 120 it was 129 what are they asking like that yeah is it worth that

43:58.180 --> 44:02.500
much money well since I've had mine since it came out it kind of turned

44:02.500 --> 44:07.100
shitty so I need to get myself a new one yeah well I don't know I'm still on the

44:07.100 --> 44:10.020
fence with it maybe if I have extra money after my vacation coming up we'll

44:10.020 --> 44:13.980
see all right amplitude thanks so much for the call I'm gonna let you go so we

44:13.980 --> 44:15.620
and get some more calls, okay?

44:15.620 --> 44:16.460
All right, cool.

44:16.460 --> 44:17.360
Have a good one, buddy.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.200
You too.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.520
Bye-bye.

44:19.520 --> 44:22.940
Let's go to at least one more call, maybe two.

44:22.940 --> 44:23.780
Let's go to this one.

44:23.780 --> 44:25.660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

44:25.660 --> 44:26.500
Hello.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.940
Hi, who's this?

44:27.940 --> 44:29.300
Nintendo Maniac 64.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.020
Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.

44:31.020 --> 44:32.780
What's on your mind, buddy?

44:32.780 --> 44:34.940
First off, what is your name?

44:34.940 --> 44:36.740
Like Bism or Bism or something.

44:36.740 --> 44:38.540
He really wanted me to call in.

44:39.380 --> 44:42.300
Okay, what do you want to call in about?

44:42.300 --> 44:44.620
First off, you can say about DS Lite and stuff.

44:44.620 --> 44:47.020
Well, you know I was up in New York and stuff,

44:47.020 --> 44:48.700
and at Nintendo World, I actually saw them

44:48.700 --> 44:51.620
installing the DS Lite demo stations, which was kinda cool.

44:53.260 --> 44:54.100
That's cool.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.940
What was the Nintendo store like?

44:55.940 --> 44:57.580
You went there for the launch?

44:57.580 --> 45:00.300
Uh, no, I was just up there in New York

45:00.300 --> 45:02.860
for this art show my sister was in.

45:02.860 --> 45:04.860
It was sort of like Scholastics and stuff.

45:04.860 --> 45:06.040
That's right, because didn't you put out the call

45:06.040 --> 45:07.140
in the last episode of the show

45:07.140 --> 45:08.980
you wanted to meet fans or something?

45:08.980 --> 45:11.220
Yeah, nobody came, so like,

45:11.220 --> 45:17.060
there's my SU for the week. I'll come next time, if I have money.

45:17.060 --> 45:20.260
So did you get to actually play the DS Lite when you were there?

45:20.260 --> 45:23.560
Um, yeah I did, but like

45:23.560 --> 45:26.660
I mean, sure it was brighter and stuff, but okay

45:26.660 --> 45:29.540
whoop-de-doo, it wasn't that great to me.

45:29.540 --> 45:33.540
Ah, so a little bit of a diss, the red's not so red.

45:33.540 --> 45:37.140
Well I didn't feel red, I mean like I just didn't care too much

45:37.140 --> 45:38.480
and uh...

45:38.480 --> 45:41.240
i got to phone some people at DDR mario mix

45:41.240 --> 45:45.420
like the super is just like an easier heavy level

45:45.420 --> 45:49.660
i haven't played mario mix since E3 last year so

45:49.660 --> 45:51.900
and i gotta quickly say a few things um...

45:51.900 --> 45:53.820
there is a hack out there

45:53.820 --> 45:54.660
for

45:54.660 --> 45:57.540
a regular disk that you can make the screen

45:57.540 --> 45:58.860
just as bright as

45:58.860 --> 46:00.300
a dslite you have the

46:00.300 --> 46:05.460
multiple light setting like on dslite but i don't want to void my warranty

46:05.460 --> 46:08.220
Some of our warranties are already passed.

46:08.220 --> 46:09.240
All right, fair enough.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.440
Yes, we have talked about that hack

46:10.440 --> 46:11.860
on previous episodes of the show.

46:11.860 --> 46:13.240
And just one last question.

46:13.240 --> 46:14.080
Yes.

46:14.080 --> 46:15.980
For any DS layers out there who have them.

46:17.100 --> 46:21.500
Do these guys know if the DS battery's the exact same

46:21.500 --> 46:24.960
shaped and stuff as a regular DS battery?

46:25.940 --> 46:28.380
Oh, the DS battery stuff.

46:28.380 --> 46:29.860
I don't know, because we don't own one.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.420
I imagine it's probably the same charger,

46:31.420 --> 46:33.700
but I'll let someone in the chat answer that.

46:33.700 --> 46:39.700
Yeah, it probably is. But you don't put actual batteries into it, it only runs on the charger.

46:39.700 --> 46:45.700
Well, I'm saying that battery life is twice as long.

46:45.700 --> 46:49.700
Gotcha. Oh, is the battery life longer? I don't know. We'll see. We'll ask Chad.

46:49.700 --> 46:55.700
I was just wondering if you could somehow get the battery out of the new one, put it in your old DS, and what if you get like 40 hours or something?

46:55.700 --> 46:58.700
Actually, Jeremy Todd 1 says it's not the same charger.

46:58.700 --> 46:59.700
Oh, really?

46:59.700 --> 47:04.740
interesting I will see we'll see there and saccharine is agreeing well we'll

47:04.740 --> 47:07.140
see what the chat room says and I'll fill you okay

47:07.140 --> 47:09.420
all right we're gonna let you go buddy we'll try and take one more call all

47:09.420 --> 47:13.060
right okay apparently my dsl just dropped out on me for a second

47:13.060 --> 47:17.860
ouch well you can always download podcast no no I mean reconnected just

47:17.860 --> 47:19.060
those my point

47:19.060 --> 47:25.740
alrighty have a good one buddy yeah bye but someone in chat room pointing out

47:25.740 --> 47:29.800
there that the battery life is of course shorter if you use the four times the

47:29.800 --> 47:33.360
brightness there so the higher the brightness the shorter the battery life

47:33.360 --> 47:39.280
obviously same thing on most laptops etc Skype line is open I saw somebody else

47:39.280 --> 47:42.320
trying to call in there but you have a chance now if you want to get in there

47:42.320 --> 47:46.160
our Skype Skype lines name is orange lounge radio all one word or you can

47:46.160 --> 47:49.620
call us on the regular telephone as well nine one six two two six ninety sixty

47:49.620 --> 47:53.120
seven here we go one last call for tonight hello you are on orange lounge

47:53.120 --> 47:58.340
radio who's this? Good evening OLR it's DMN how you doing? Hi DMN what's on your

47:58.340 --> 48:04.080
mind buddy? Um I'd like to give an FU of a week to my own company. Don't you work

48:04.080 --> 48:09.560
for Nintendo? I do. Uh-oh what do they do? It's nothing it's just a disturbing

48:09.560 --> 48:13.240
trend I've been seeing with the DS games since we've been on the subject of the DS

48:13.240 --> 48:17.440
light with the games like brain training and Nintendogs I don't know if you guys

48:17.440 --> 48:20.540
notice this but these games seem to have a shelf life of two weeks and that's it

48:20.540 --> 48:25.780
and people would just toss them away no I agree I regret I think what at e3 last

48:25.780 --> 48:29.220
year I said in ten dogs was like the runner-up for game of show I totally

48:29.220 --> 48:33.260
regret that because it was fun for the hour I played at e3 or not even that but

48:33.260 --> 48:36.660
it's fun for the time I played at e3 when I actually got at home to play it

48:36.660 --> 48:44.100
was the thrill lasted a week maybe two I traded yesterday it's unfortunate

48:44.100 --> 48:48.740
because I I've yet to see a BS game that's had a good replay value short of

48:48.740 --> 48:54.000
Mario Kart and Tetris, and those are the online games which obviously give those games more

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
replay value.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.380
I can't stand Prime Hunters, because first person shooters on a portable are just a bad

48:59.380 --> 49:00.380
idea.

49:00.380 --> 49:04.140
Well, hopefully, and we're echoing really bad by the way, you might want to back away

49:04.140 --> 49:07.540
from your speakers a little bit or turn it down.

49:07.540 --> 49:12.020
Hopefully there will be more online games in Nintendo's future, many many more.

49:12.020 --> 49:14.260
Oh definitely.

49:14.260 --> 49:16.920
Alright.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.520
But that's about it.

49:18.520 --> 49:22.900
I wanted to rent that and see what people thought.

49:22.900 --> 49:27.860
Hopefully I can get to my inside sources because I'm starting back up at Nintendo.

49:27.860 --> 49:29.460
I think we're starting Wii testing tomorrow.

49:29.460 --> 49:32.460
So hopefully I can get more info on that for you guys as well.

49:32.460 --> 49:37.260
Now wait a minute, didn't you say that you were against, like on an earlier show, you

49:37.260 --> 49:41.800
were against the October date because the Wii's weren't in yet?

49:41.800 --> 49:42.800
So maybe...

49:42.800 --> 49:43.800
Yes, that's what I've been hearing.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.900
Ah, so maybe it'll get interesting.

49:46.900 --> 49:53.600
Yes, maybe it will and also operation get Reggie Phil's aim on the shows now underway. Thank you, please

49:53.600 --> 49:58.880
I would I would love to make sweet love to Reggie through an interview form on this problem

49:59.440 --> 50:02.280
I'll be sure to wear protection during that show I will

50:03.160 --> 50:08.920
All right, DM and have a good one buddy. Thanks for your time. We always appreciate the inside scoop. All right. Bye later

50:10.040 --> 50:12.840
All righty good Skype in tonight. Good job

50:12.840 --> 50:16.840
Most of the Skype calls were pretty clear too, I appreciated that.

50:16.840 --> 50:20.840
You guys are calling Echo 1, 2, 3 beforehand, like a good

50:20.840 --> 50:24.840
Skyper does. Alright, last minute stories boys and girls, do we have any last minute stories

50:24.840 --> 50:28.840
here in the studio? Anybody, anybody?

50:28.840 --> 50:32.840
There was just some stupid thing about... I know we left out a lot from your

50:32.840 --> 50:36.840
role this week, Loki, but there was just too damn much for two hours and some of it was

50:36.840 --> 50:40.840
kind of, I don't know, but was there anything you really wanted to mention? There was some

50:40.840 --> 50:46.440
patent filed by Sony about some stupid electronic device that can roll up, almost like electric

50:46.440 --> 50:49.440
paper, but not, I don't know.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.600
Yeah, but Sony does a lot of electronic things.

50:51.600 --> 50:54.720
They're saying that it's going to be used for a game system, and I say no.

50:54.720 --> 50:56.280
No, Sony does a lot of electronic things.

50:56.280 --> 51:00.240
Well, I heard the Wii filed a patent, Nintendo had a patent on instant messaging, and my

51:00.240 --> 51:02.280
reaction was, duh.

51:02.280 --> 51:05.640
You think the Wii's going to have a service kind of like Xbox Live where you can instant

51:05.640 --> 51:06.640
message people?

51:06.640 --> 51:07.640
Of course.

51:07.640 --> 51:08.640
Of course.

51:08.640 --> 51:09.640
Duh.

51:09.640 --> 51:16.640
I didn't put it in the list for tonight. Now that would be rad. PictoChat on the internet.

51:16.640 --> 51:20.520
Yeah, that would be pretty sweet. I would love to draw penises and have them seen worldwide.

51:20.520 --> 51:27.000
Well, I was going to say for more of our UK listeners, because I'm not a huge fan of football,

51:27.000 --> 51:32.680
but is this UK football or US football? Yeah, like soccer. But Love Football is available

51:32.680 --> 51:39.300
on Japanese Xbox Live. You can download the demo. So there's actually a link on Gamers

51:39.300 --> 51:45.780
Report it's www.gamersreport.com slash news slash 2820 and it'll teach you in case you

51:45.780 --> 51:51.440
didn't know how to create an account a silver membership for under the Japanese territory

51:51.440 --> 51:55.900
to download those demos so you can actually play that game which is kind of neat I might

51:55.900 --> 52:00.740
have to do that and also oblivion could I do that with the just by making a new account

52:00.740 --> 52:06.960
on my current xbox yeah I might do that also oblivion got patched and all the gold and

52:06.960 --> 52:11.920
duplication glitches, as you would put it, were removed.

52:11.920 --> 52:16.080
And also that patch is causing issues, freezes and whatnot.

52:16.080 --> 52:24.760
However, there is that undocumented function that was found in the Spring 360 update to

52:24.760 --> 52:31.240
clear your cache, and it also removes any updates that have been done on live or any

52:31.240 --> 52:37.880
of the games so that you can actually, if you accidentally play Oblivion connected to

52:37.880 --> 52:42.240
live you can un-patch it so that you can cheat in it again.

52:42.240 --> 52:45.600
And the way you do that actually is pretty simple.

52:45.600 --> 52:52.080
Under the main menu or whatever you would push, or actually going under the system blade

52:52.080 --> 52:58.560
and then under memory you push Y on either the hard drive or the memory unit and push

52:58.560 --> 53:05.480
x, x, left button, right button, x, x, and it'll pop up a little blade saying do you

53:05.480 --> 53:12.920
wish to perform maintenance, yes, all your updates are gone, but basically the safe way

53:12.920 --> 53:18.000
if you haven't played it and updated it yet, just unhook it from live when you're playing

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
the game.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Pretty simple.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Alright.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.720
We're going to go to our final story of the evening, and Loki it looks like it's yours.

53:25.720 --> 53:26.720
Yes.

53:26.720 --> 53:35.020
So, anyways, I think we remember back a couple weeks ago, we talked about Codemasters and

53:35.020 --> 53:37.760
how they're basically making a game called The Turds.

53:37.760 --> 53:44.360
Well, The Turds is actually a series, and they're being made available through a website

53:44.360 --> 53:47.640
called Funsta.com.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.640
When I think of turd, I don't think of fun.

53:49.640 --> 53:50.640
Well, Funsta.com.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.200
I think of the Playstation 3.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.200
You know what?

53:53.200 --> 53:54.200
I think of Taco Bell.

53:54.200 --> 53:56.400
You can actually play these games right now.

53:56.400 --> 54:00.800
at least one of them. Some of the wonderful games you get to play would be

54:00.800 --> 54:04.080
Donkey Pong, which is gonna be

54:04.080 --> 54:07.240
obviously turd-based. Now I've heard of Donkey Bong,

54:07.240 --> 54:10.480
but I think that's something different. Or, no, I'm sorry, Donkey Bong...Donkey Punch,

54:10.480 --> 54:13.600
I think? No, this is Donkey Pong. Forget it. Poopert.

54:13.600 --> 54:16.920
Dung Beetle Rally.

54:16.920 --> 54:20.640
So, wait, these guys just take games that we know and love and put poop in them?

54:20.640 --> 54:23.880
That's pretty much...That's disgusting. Um, turd herders.

54:23.880 --> 54:27.560
The Men in Crack, and

54:27.560 --> 54:31.920
Bogger, which is available now. I equate this with the,

54:31.920 --> 54:37.440
what is that, the Crazy Frog thing? That thing that sings the Axle F song?

54:37.440 --> 54:39.480
That thing.

54:39.480 --> 54:42.600
I equate these turd games with that thing. They have to put that

54:42.600 --> 54:47.480
hideous thing in everything. Let me put it this way. Apparently it's a toy series that's in

54:47.480 --> 54:48.400
the UK,

54:48.400 --> 54:53.320
apparently. Why anyone would want to play with poop, but apparently

54:53.320 --> 55:01.380
If you want to play any of these games, go to www.funsta.com, that's F-U-N-S-T-A, slash

55:01.380 --> 55:06.340
turds, and you can actually play Bogger, which I was playing a little bit during some of

55:06.340 --> 55:11.220
those Skype line calls, and it just plays like Frogger but it's sewer and poop based

55:11.220 --> 55:13.380
and it's stupid.

55:13.380 --> 55:20.580
You can download poo tones and wallpapers also from that website, and turd merchandise.

55:20.580 --> 55:25.940
And they have a poo calculator to find out how much your turds are worth.

55:25.940 --> 55:29.160
This by the way will be the only time that Orange Lounge Radio endorses you playing with

55:29.160 --> 55:30.340
your poo.

55:30.340 --> 55:33.420
But even then, we're looking at you funny.

55:33.420 --> 55:40.340
So Funsta.com and you can check out Bogger, the rest of the games are coming out a little

55:40.340 --> 55:42.340
bit later.

55:42.340 --> 55:49.840
Was it Dung Beetle Rally June 20th, Poobert July 4th, you can play Donkey Pong and Bogger

55:49.840 --> 55:56.640
right now and July 18th turd herders been in crack and on that note it's time

55:56.640 --> 56:01.240
to end the show let's go around and get everybody's final thought my final

56:01.240 --> 56:06.920
thought is I want this sinus infection to go away Loki your final thought I

56:06.920 --> 56:11.760
want this pink guy to go away and dark soccer your final thought I want another

56:11.760 --> 56:19.480
cookie reject false icons here you go no no you said you wanted it no my brain

56:19.480 --> 56:24.440
telling me that I want one, I'm actually quite satisfied with these Swedish ginger cookies.

56:24.440 --> 56:27.240
That's going to do it for the show, thank you guys so much for tuning in, whether you

56:27.240 --> 56:30.800

Hey, did you know we're only like two weeks away from our four year anniversary show?

56:35.540 --> 56:36.880
Our fourth birthday party.

56:36.880 --> 56:37.880
Ooh hoo.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.120
Ooh hoo, we're mommy wow, we're big kids now.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.480
We're out of training pants.

56:41.480 --> 56:45.820
And we'll try to do something special for the four year show, although we're saving

56:45.820 --> 56:50.080
most of the bells and whistles I think for episode 200 which should be I think

56:50.080 --> 56:53.740
it's like in October or something we planned it out I don't know but stay

56:53.740 --> 56:57.160
