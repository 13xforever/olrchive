01:04.740 --> 01:09.260
tonight on the show that's a that's a joke somewhere in there yes and we're

01:09.260 --> 01:14.940
going to start right here live on the air as we participate in a co-host Battle

01:14.940 --> 01:18.820
Royale of which I'll win because I'm vicious why would we do that I don't

01:18.820 --> 01:20.940
I don't know, because it'd be good ratings.

01:20.940 --> 01:22.460
I don't want to die.

01:22.460 --> 01:23.380
We'll fake it.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.860
For those who were listening live last week,

01:24.860 --> 01:26.500
we were talking about the Americanization

01:26.500 --> 01:27.540
of Battle Royale a little bit.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.420
I don't remember if it was after the show or in the middle

01:29.420 --> 01:30.300
or something we were talking about,

01:30.300 --> 01:31.660
Americanization of Battle Royale,

01:31.660 --> 01:34.020
and that whole thought still makes me kind of sad.

01:34.020 --> 01:36.260
I don't know, it's just, they're not gonna get it right.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.780
You know they're not gonna get it right.

01:37.780 --> 01:42.540
It completely just makes me want to go crawl to the corner

01:42.540 --> 01:43.740
and cry for an hour.

01:43.740 --> 01:45.820
I hope it's a rumor.

01:45.820 --> 01:46.660
I hope it's a sick, sad rumor.

01:46.660 --> 01:48.540
It's not a rumor, I've heard it from people.

01:48.540 --> 01:49.660
IT'S NOT A RUMOR!

01:50.660 --> 01:51.380
Tumor...

01:51.380 --> 01:52.560
Uh, anyway, also-

01:52.560 --> 01:53.960
Yeah, the movie will be a tumor.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.920
Also say hello to our invisible fourth guest, but they're really there.

01:57.920 --> 02:02.400
It's our chat room over at www.orangelandre.com, click on chat.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.340
It's your guys' show too, we love to put in your comments and everything.

02:06.340 --> 02:08.820
And I'll tell you what, we have some sick fans.

02:08.820 --> 02:13.300
Because I was just talking to one before the show tonight, we have somebody from the UK who's listening tonight.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.540
So say hello to Digi Nova, listening for the first time.

02:15.540 --> 02:16.040
Hello!

02:16.040 --> 02:18.640
I think there was somebody else in there that said they were listening for the first time tonight as well.

02:18.640 --> 02:23.540
I think it was, uh, Anoshi, and I apologize if I butchered that name. Anoshi. Anoshi.

02:23.540 --> 02:27.240
Uh, also listening for the first time tonight. Not from the UK, but still.

02:27.240 --> 02:31.440
Uh, thanks to you guys for listening. Of course, a big hello to everybody in there tonight,

02:31.440 --> 02:35.140
listening for the first time, the hundredth time, or whatever the case may be.

02:35.140 --> 02:39.940
Uh, let's talk about our gaming week. We always like to start off the show talking about the games we've been playing.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.640
Dark Sakura, start us off.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.080
I played a number of things over the course of this week.

02:45.080 --> 02:50.780
I got my DS Lite after the show, and so I've been playing Animal Crossing again this week.

02:50.780 --> 02:58.740
And I've also been playing the, on the Japanese website locoroco.jp, they have the demo for

02:58.740 --> 03:03.280
Locoroco for PSP, and I've been playing the hell out of that today.

03:03.280 --> 03:09.600
And Osutatakai Oendan today, which is actually harder than I thought it would be, but it's

03:09.600 --> 03:12.720
It's kind of hard to play if you have somebody else's music playing over it and can't really

03:12.720 --> 03:14.080
listen very well.

03:14.080 --> 03:19.400
So yeah, I got to the second stage and then I was like, okay, headache time, because two

03:19.400 --> 03:26.080
musics because my friend Krista was over playing, she was playing Loco at the time.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.920
So I've been in Port Happy.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.640
When's Krista coming to the show?

03:30.640 --> 03:34.200
You know, I tried to get her to come tonight, but she had to drive back to Davis.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.480
When you two get together, it's comedy gold.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.680
So we need her on the show.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.980
she'll come for the big four-year anniversary next week we're having we're

03:40.980 --> 03:45.480
having a fourth birthday party we're celebrating we're celebrating our that

03:45.480 --> 03:48.940
was great radio by the way when he held up your fingers we're celebrating our

03:48.940 --> 03:53.280
entrance into preschool next week it should be fun yeah I'm trying to find

03:53.280 --> 03:58.320
people to come next week but yeah that's oh yeah I turned on World of Warcraft

03:58.320 --> 04:05.280
and then shut it back down because I was like I don't want to play I've actually done that before

04:05.280 --> 04:08.500
force if it was Final Fantasy XI, like I boo- and you know how Final Fantasy XI has that

04:08.500 --> 04:11.360
huge old boot-up sequence that goes with it? Like I get all the-

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
Which I turned off?

04:12.360 --> 04:16.280
Yeah, well, you still have to go through that frickin' play online and all that stuff before

04:16.280 --> 04:17.280
you get in the game-

04:17.280 --> 04:18.280
When you get there though, it's like, enter, enter, enter, enter.

04:18.280 --> 04:21.280
Seriously. And I've done that before where I went in the whole way and then like I finally

04:21.280 --> 04:24.960
get in there like, you know, three minutes later and I'm like, you know what, why did

04:24.960 --> 04:29.320
I do that? I don't really want to play this. I don't have the time to LFP. I don't have

04:29.320 --> 04:31.680
the time for this today.

04:31.680 --> 04:35.880
I think there's better things to do with my time than to immerse myself into an MMO.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.680
I don't know what you hear about my gaming week, but we'll get to that in a minute.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.680
Addict.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.680
Addict!

04:40.680 --> 04:41.680
Anything else?

04:41.680 --> 04:42.680
No.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.680
How's that LocoRoco?

04:45.680 --> 04:46.680
It's crack.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.680
I love the music.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
It's on drugs.

04:48.680 --> 04:54.280
I went to the website for LocoRoco a few weeks ago, because they have like a mini version

04:54.280 --> 04:59.000
of the game, like all in Flash, and I thought the music was so adorable.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
It's cute.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.180
But it's like it's really frustrating cuz then cuz I find myself trying to tilt the PSP upside down trying to tilt the world

05:06.580 --> 05:09.500
And trying to get it to go and then you get up to the moon

05:09.500 --> 05:13.140
It's like no you have to have twice as many pieces of your body as you have now

05:13.260 --> 05:18.680
Well crap and then you fall down the little hole when you split into multiple pieces you fall down the hole and then something comes

05:18.680 --> 05:23.120
In each part of you. It's like no you're not supposed to do that spit me out

05:23.120 --> 05:28.580
out and and and that's it you know that game reminds me of an old-ass Super

05:28.580 --> 05:32.420
Nintendo game called on the ball did you ever play that it looks like it horrid

05:32.420 --> 05:35.240
the mode 7 that's all you did was you spun the screen so you can't really

05:35.240 --> 05:39.100
pick up your TV and intern it so you know you were pretty ease the L&R

05:39.100 --> 05:42.980
buttons on the Super Nintendo because you do on a local Rocco that's cool but

05:42.980 --> 05:48.100
it's funny I was looking at the screen I was like Rocco Rocco and it's it's yeah

05:48.100 --> 05:53.040
it's all super Japanese everything isn't Japanese so but it's like really

05:53.040 --> 05:57.240
easy Japanese so it's not like that hard to read it everything's like in written

05:57.240 --> 06:01.720
in katakana so it's super easy unless you're like me and you don't understand

06:01.720 --> 06:05.120
the lick of Japanese no matter what katakana hiragana I don't want to know

06:05.120 --> 06:09.480
the difference I I know there's two but that's just because after doing this

06:09.480 --> 06:13.240
show for four years and listening to you bitch about enough Japanese games I

06:13.240 --> 06:19.280
picked up that my job is done all right low-key how was your gaming week it was

06:19.280 --> 06:27.240
pretty good. What did I play? I played a lot of Jewel Quest and I actually beat the game

06:27.240 --> 06:31.620
finally but except the only thing is you have to play it through like six different difficulties

06:31.620 --> 06:38.060
which is kind of lame but I don't know. And then a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers.

06:38.060 --> 06:44.420
I was going to be playing point blank DS but a certain GameStop didn't have it in. Looked

06:44.420 --> 06:50.540
to be crazy when asked for it. Point blank on a DS? Who would want that game? That sounds

06:50.540 --> 06:57.140
cool. It is cool. But they're not cool. Remember how you were talking about before in the distributor

06:57.140 --> 07:01.420
world how certain titles are broken down, like you have your AA titles and your A title,

07:01.420 --> 07:04.940
like a AA title would be like, what, Grand Theft Auto or something really big, Halo,

07:04.940 --> 07:09.180
you know, and then like your A titles, which are kind of big, and then like B titles, C

07:09.180 --> 07:13.580
titles, what is point blank like an E title or something, apparently? I have it as a triple

07:13.580 --> 07:18.260
It's a long-running franchise and it would've been perfect for the DS, but apparently GameStop

07:18.260 --> 07:19.260
doesn't think that way.

07:19.260 --> 07:23.820
GameStop's more concerned of Urban Chaos or Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.

07:23.820 --> 07:28.640
Yeah, I can't play them on a DS, dumbass, and this is probably the only solid DS title

07:28.640 --> 07:30.380
coming out this week.

07:30.380 --> 07:36.680
But no, they're more concerned with, you know, ripping me off on turning in my DVDs now.

07:36.680 --> 07:41.300
By the way, they mostly, all their DVDs, they magically don't have in their system, therefore

07:41.300 --> 07:46.320
they have to give you the generic price, which is 75 cents, to which I told them to fuck

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
off.

07:47.320 --> 07:54.100
Um, actually, that, DVDs don't really sell, so that's...

07:54.100 --> 07:56.100
I know, our company buys it back from them.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.140
Take them to a video clearance center or whatever.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.140
I know.

07:59.140 --> 08:00.140
Sorry, that's local.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.140
Anyway.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.140
It's so far away.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.140
But anyway.

08:03.140 --> 08:04.140
So yeah, they sucked.

08:04.140 --> 08:05.140
And um...

08:05.140 --> 08:06.140
No they don't.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.140
They pay my bills.

08:07.140 --> 08:08.140
But they suck.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.140
Uh...

08:09.140 --> 08:10.140
No they don't.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.140
They pay my bills.

08:11.140 --> 08:15.100
You don't carry point blank children, were they Samsas?

08:15.100 --> 08:17.020
Well I'm not driving all the way over there, so.

08:17.020 --> 08:18.020
Alright.

08:18.020 --> 08:19.020
Loki games.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.600
So anyways, um, I played through Blazing Angels, I'm trying to beat the game so I can sell

08:23.600 --> 08:25.980
it back because it sucks.

08:25.980 --> 08:29.420
I don't know what they were trying to do with the art style in the game but it's really

08:29.420 --> 08:34.860
annoying because when you're flying there's this big dark black crap on the outside of

08:34.860 --> 08:37.960
the screen that's, I don't know what it's supposed to look like.

08:37.960 --> 08:42.360
Is it because I'm blacking out because I'm flying or is it supposed to be what?

08:42.360 --> 08:46.040
But when I'm shooting at something everything else gets dark on the outside and bright in

08:46.040 --> 08:47.040
the middle.

08:47.040 --> 08:51.560
It's like I have a TV with bad contrast or something and it just can't fix itself.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.920
That's what the whole game plays like and so I don't get that.

08:55.920 --> 09:01.560
The game is kind of retarded but hopefully least achievements there's only seven of them

09:01.560 --> 09:06.600
and it's pretty easy it's just like beating the game a couple times.

09:06.600 --> 09:12.600
or points or... I got it for free, okay? So I'm gonna sell it back after we get all the achievements.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.600
So is that the only reason it sucks, the graphics? Or is it just not a fun game or what?

09:16.600 --> 09:20.600
The graphics and the fact that the camera is really annoying.

09:20.600 --> 09:27.600
And the camera a lot of times you can lock on different planes to see where they are so you can select a target.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.600
The only problem is though is there's so many planes flying around it's hard to target anything.

09:31.600 --> 09:38.600
And half the time it targets the wrong thing. It's just like Grand Theft Auto. It targets the wrong objects. So that's kind of annoying.

09:38.600 --> 09:46.600
So the camera, the graphics are really annoying. Otherwise it's okay. I was playing some multiplayer on it and that's kind of fun.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.600
I think that's probably the only reason you'd want to get it. It's just multiplayer.

09:49.600 --> 09:58.600
But to be honest, I'd be willing to see what Oversea Fighters looks like. That'd probably be a better buy versus Blades and Angels.

09:58.600 --> 10:03.640
angels but I don't know it's an easy game I guess so that's pretty much all I

10:03.640 --> 10:08.560
played this week that and granted that a liberty city stories still they'll be

10:08.560 --> 10:12.800
playing that game until the next one comes out all right and each week we

10:12.800 --> 10:15.720
find more and more wrong with the multiplayer which we'll get into later

10:15.720 --> 10:21.480
all right my gaming week let's see I oh actually I want to go chat real quick

10:21.480 --> 10:25.080
before we go to my gaming week I want to point out Ari Masan is talking about the

10:25.080 --> 10:29.960
LocoRoco English demo which apparently is available at psp.playstation.com you can

10:29.960 --> 10:34.160
browse around your PSP and you can get the demo for the English version of LocoRoco.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.080
Yeah we couldn't get that to work so we just got the Japanese one off the

10:37.080 --> 10:40.920
website. But that's good news for people like me if I can get it to work so who

10:40.920 --> 10:44.120
can't who doesn't understand you remember a lick of Japanese. Let's see

10:44.120 --> 10:48.560
something. There are detailed instructions for downloading on my live journal. Yeah

10:48.560 --> 10:51.040
but not everybody not everybody that listens to show can read your live

10:51.040 --> 10:54.480
journal so. Nope not everybody is that privileged. All right we do have a live

10:54.480 --> 10:57.160
journal community though it's a username orange lounge if you are a live journal

10:57.160 --> 11:00.120
member and maybe if you ask really nicely on that community Jamie will

11:00.120 --> 11:04.640
cross-post her instructions that would be cool all right

11:04.640 --> 11:08.760
I'm awesome also wants to point out he 100% at loco roko in nine minutes well

11:08.760 --> 11:15.440
you big stud go you all right anyway my gaming week I also played way down the

11:15.440 --> 11:21.080
the DS dance or I don't know it's it's gonna be elite beat agents here in the

11:21.080 --> 11:23.080
And it's going to be a completely different game.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.080
Yeah, because it's very Japanese.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.080
They're completely redoing the whole story,

11:29.080 --> 11:31.080
redoing the characters in it.

11:31.080 --> 11:35.080
There's these guys in suits and not the male cheer squad.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.080
They're going to have to because it's all the text, all the music.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.080
It's not that they're going to have to, it's that they are.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
Everything is being changed.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.080
I was saying, because if they had to translate it all anyway,

11:46.080 --> 11:48.080
they're going to have to build it from the ground up practically

11:48.080 --> 11:51.480
up practically because it's so very, you know, Japanese.

11:51.480 --> 11:56.320
It's like you've got the Office Lady stage and you have the, you know, they, no, it's

11:56.320 --> 11:59.080
actually pretty much, it's pretty much considered a sequel.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.080
Right.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.520
Just released out over here.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
Interesting.

12:02.520 --> 12:07.240
I, I, I have only really like seen the game kinda, like I think I saw it for like two

12:07.240 --> 12:11.220
minutes at E3, so I didn't really get a chance to really figure out what it's all about,

12:11.220 --> 12:12.220
but it's actually kind of fun.

12:12.220 --> 12:16.320
For those who haven't played it, it's, it's a music game, and it plays music in the background

12:16.320 --> 12:20.400
and you tap on the DS screen certain places sort of in beat with the music

12:20.400 --> 12:23.880
depending on what the lyrics are but sometimes you trace, right like almost

12:23.880 --> 12:27.120
like in Guitar Man. Have you played the one song there was one song where you

12:27.120 --> 12:31.400
draw a heart you trace a heart it's so cute it's like a love song. I only played up to the second stage.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.160
Listening to two musics going on at the same time just gave me a headache. I was

12:35.160 --> 12:38.680
playing on Miklata's DS because and he has them all unlocked because he's been

12:38.680 --> 12:41.220
playing that game like crazy and he told me to play this stage because there was

12:41.220 --> 12:44.240
a heart that you draw at the end I thought that was really cute so it's it's

12:44.240 --> 12:46.140
It's a very simple game, but it's hard.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.140
It's a heart.

12:47.140 --> 12:48.260
It judges very harshly.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.500
You have to be good or it's going to penalize you big time.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.860
So it was a lot of fun.

12:52.860 --> 12:55.980
I'm actually thinking about importing it if it is going to be a whole lot different from

12:55.980 --> 12:56.980
the English one.

12:56.980 --> 12:58.680
It would make it worth it.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.680
So we'll see.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.180
I also don't like paying that much to import games, but that one's a really good one.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.180
It's fun.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.540
You know, because I like music games, obviously, as we all do.

13:06.540 --> 13:09.820
Orange Launch kind of started as a music game station exclusively.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.480
So obviously I have a big love for that.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.100
So I want to check that out.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.740
Also, since I was playing that, I was actually playing it on Miklotov's DS Lite, so I got

13:16.740 --> 13:21.940
to put my hands on a DS Lite, and, oh my gosh, screens are so bright on those.

13:21.940 --> 13:22.940
They didn't lie.

13:22.940 --> 13:23.940
They're a lot nicer.

13:23.940 --> 13:29.140
They're a lot brighter, a lot crisper, a lot cleaner, and the stylus, I noticed, was a

13:29.140 --> 13:33.180
lot thicker, it was a lot more kind of sturdy, I mean, I'm sure you're going to lose it just

13:33.180 --> 13:36.900
as easy, but it fit a lot better in the hand.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.140
The only complaint I have about it is the sound isn't as powerful, and that's probably

13:40.140 --> 13:43.820
because of the fact that you're putting it in a smaller box, it's not capable of producing

13:43.820 --> 13:50.320
quite the large volume with no headphones, but otherwise it's a great system, but I'm

13:50.320 --> 13:55.720
not going to buy one right now, because I'm not going to be a sucker to Nintendo's...

13:55.720 --> 13:59.780
they always do this, they'll put out new colors, and then I say, oh I want one in the new colors,

13:59.780 --> 14:04.660
so I'm holding out for the new colors, is what I'm doing, so maybe I'll get a DS Lite

14:04.660 --> 14:08.100
at that point, but for now I'll stick with my DS Fat, thank you very much.

14:08.100 --> 14:12.420
And then also my gaming week has been a hell of a lot of World of Warcraft.

14:12.420 --> 14:14.940
Just playing the crap out of World of Warcraft.

14:14.940 --> 14:19.060
They actually launched a bunch of new servers on Saturday.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.940
And I kind of like starting on a new server because, I don't know, there's something kind

14:21.940 --> 14:25.760
of fun about the fact that there's no uber powerful people.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.060
And even though the noob areas are really crowded, you know, everybody's trying to work

14:29.060 --> 14:32.980
together for a common goal and it's really easy to find parties for some of the noob

14:32.980 --> 14:36.900
quests because everybody's trying to be like the first to be level 60.

14:36.900 --> 14:37.940
So that was kind of fun.

14:37.940 --> 14:43.220
And I played hardcore, I mean that server went up, I think Saturday at noon, or maybe

14:43.220 --> 14:49.120
it was Friday at noon, I'm not sure, and I'm already level 13, which I'm sure some people

14:49.120 --> 14:54.760
are like, oh that's nothing, I can get from 0 to 10 in an hour, but you know, I'm not

14:54.760 --> 14:58.580
a hardcore World of Warcraft player, so for me, getting to level 13 in the course of a

14:58.580 --> 15:03.280
weekend took a lot of playing, so I'm quite proud of that accomplishment and saddened

15:03.280 --> 15:04.480
at the same time.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.320
But I'm having fun on the new server, I'm playing a mage, and mages are a heck of a

15:07.320 --> 15:11.960
lot of fun. Otherwise that's pretty much it. A little Burnout Revenge here and

15:11.960 --> 15:16.800
there. A little other 360 miscellaneous arcade games but not a lot of new stuff

15:16.800 --> 15:23.120
otherwise. Going over to the chat room www.orangeloungeradio.com click on

15:23.120 --> 15:29.700
chat. Let's see, Tweak thinks the DS Lite is too small. Tweak says the DS Lite is

15:29.700 --> 15:33.960
too small. It is, you know, it feels a little different in the hands but I

15:33.960 --> 15:38.280
I was reading complaints online about the DS Lite kind of felt different, it didn't

15:38.280 --> 15:39.680
feel right because it was too small.

15:39.680 --> 15:46.320
I didn't notice it, it felt fine to me, but maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.520
I know she's saying that I went through about two black ones until I found out about the

15:50.520 --> 15:55.360
white PSP, so kind of going back to the whole colors and releasing new systems and all that

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
stuff.

15:56.360 --> 16:01.720
Alright, anyway, let's get into gaming news for the week, and we'll start it off tonight

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720
with Loki.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.220
Loki has some politically-oriented gaming news tonight.

16:05.220 --> 16:10.700
Yeah, of course, another week, another state signed in, another violent games bill.

16:10.700 --> 16:17.920
This time it's Oklahoma, and Governor Brad Henry basically signed that in, and of course,

16:17.920 --> 16:24.260
this one actually not really fining the kids who are buying the games, but they basically

16:24.260 --> 16:31.180
are forbidding that they can sell anything that is deemed harmful to minors to them,

16:31.180 --> 16:35.340
you know, I'd pretty much restrict anything like M-rated or adult-rated, and this goes into the

16:35.340 --> 16:43.020
effect November 1st. Of course, like everything else, the ESA has stepped in to sue them, so

16:43.900 --> 16:49.980
you know, it's going to be interesting. But the governor's basic reasoning for signing this in was

16:49.980 --> 16:54.940
he believed the violence in video games has grown to epic proportions. Some video games glorify

16:54.940 --> 17:00.540
violence to a degree seldom seen in even the bloodiest movies now. I'm not sure if he's seen

17:00.540 --> 17:04.600
hostile yet, but I think that's a lot worse than some of the games I've played.

17:04.600 --> 17:09.780
Anyways, continues on, while parents have the ultimate responsibility for what their

17:09.780 --> 17:16.000
children do and see this legislation is another tool to ensure that our young people are not

17:16.000 --> 17:20.440
saturated in violence, this gives parents the power to more closely regulate the games

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
their children play.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.280
No, actually, this doesn't do anything.

17:23.280 --> 17:28.280
All this does is do what people are doing already and the parents are going to buy their

17:28.280 --> 17:33.720
games for them and then they're gonna go I didn't know I didn't know that on the

17:33.720 --> 17:37.480
back of the box when it said violent content there is violent content in the game I

17:37.480 --> 17:42.840
just thought they like seeing those words on there it's retarded and like

17:42.840 --> 17:48.120
most of the times no matter how many laws and how easily explain this to

17:48.120 --> 17:53.240
parents they don't care they're just gonna give it to their children to get

17:53.240 --> 17:56.560
little Billy to stop whining and then when little Billy goes and murders their

17:56.560 --> 18:03.040
neighbor then they'll go oh my god the games are horrible it's not because i didn't watch them and

18:03.040 --> 18:10.880
bought him a gun or anything it's just because the games are ah it's just people need to take

18:10.880 --> 18:15.600
responsibility for their children and the government thinks that they can help this out well

18:16.640 --> 18:19.120
you know i think they should pass breeding laws instead

18:20.480 --> 18:24.000
so the stupid people stop having children standardized testing

18:24.000 --> 18:31.520
So, that's basically what's going on. Of course, I'm sure we'll hear more about how the ESA

18:31.520 --> 18:36.880
is going to be suing them. And so far, in the last five lawsuits or whatever, they've

18:36.880 --> 18:44.080
been deemed unconstitutional. So, you know, it's because they get those laws, you know,

18:44.080 --> 18:51.760
that harmful minors, well, that's subjective. So, you know what? Who says who? What's harmful?

18:51.760 --> 18:57.560
And you know, they haven't really proven that games are harmful to minors, so I don't know.

18:57.560 --> 19:01.960
I just have to comment here, I love that the chat isn't saying a damn thing about the article

19:01.960 --> 19:02.960
at all.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.440
Instead, these are the type of comments we're getting in the chat room right now.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.960
Let's see, YouWillBowToMe says, Loki's girl voice makes me laugh.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.680
To which the best says, Is Loki a girl?

19:12.680 --> 19:15.480
And WonderDogHerald says, I love Loki's fem parent voice.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.520
And Bandit says, Let's pitch in to get him a training bra.

19:19.520 --> 19:23.880
I'm glad they're... I'm glad they're listening.

19:23.880 --> 19:28.080
I know, I'm glad they hear the message in this about this horrible ignorant law.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.480
Because I think a lot of parents are like this, you know, they're all

19:30.480 --> 19:34.440
mmm, emirating, ooh, shiny! And then, you know, just let their kids buy it. I mean,

19:34.440 --> 19:37.540
that's what it comes down to. Now, again, not

19:37.540 --> 19:41.200
all parents, because we have intelligent parents that listen to this program. Yes, there are

19:41.200 --> 19:42.620
intelligent parents out there.

19:42.620 --> 19:46.960
By the way, I commend you all. Happy Father's Day to the gamer's dad,

19:46.960 --> 19:50.760
gamer dad's listening tonight forgot to mention I didn't call mine

19:50.760 --> 19:54.200
you still have a few more hours days not over yet

19:54.200 --> 19:57.320
let me put it this way it's 8 something in Alabama right now

19:57.320 --> 20:01.280
what's more violent simulating killing you know people

20:01.280 --> 20:04.760
in a game and then granted the people are very you know

20:04.760 --> 20:08.280
cartoonish or going outside

20:08.280 --> 20:12.680
and going killing a deer playing hockey or playing hockey

20:12.680 --> 20:16.800
Jaded2006, I think, hit the nail on the head here.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.760
It's been repeating over and over again.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.860
I think that's why the chat room is stopping to really refrain from commenting.

20:21.860 --> 20:25.680
How many times have we heard this type of story, but in different states, where it's

20:25.680 --> 20:32.320
just, you know, let's blame the games, let's put this law with vague, vague, vague language

20:32.320 --> 20:37.440
as to what a violent video game really is, and, you know, blame it on them.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.080
Meanwhile, you know, I just saw The Omen after last week's show.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.760
I went and saw The Omen with a friend and it was pretty violent, I mean it's not the

20:46.760 --> 20:50.240
most violent movie I've ever saw, but there's some pretty gruesome murder scenes in it.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.080
And you know, top ten at the box office, no one bats an eye.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.280
No motions to ban sales of The Omen.

20:55.280 --> 21:01.360
I mean, everyone's like, oh you can beat up a hooker in Grand Theft Auto.

21:01.360 --> 21:06.200
Okay, the only reason she's a hooker is because that's the skin that's on the character, okay?

21:06.200 --> 21:10.280
Otherwise it's exactly a clone of all the other citizens in there, and to be honest

21:10.280 --> 21:15.200
it's not that graphic I mean granted you can blow off heads on them but it's just

21:15.200 --> 21:20.040
it's cartoonish looking it's just retarded it's not like a game that you

21:20.040 --> 21:25.240
know shows you ripping apart people and all their organs just flying everywhere

21:25.240 --> 21:30.680
and just you know that gruesome details but then again in movies they have that

21:30.680 --> 21:34.880
all the time and you never hear anyone you know trying to eat somebody after

21:34.880 --> 21:41.420
watching a zombie movie I don't know to which we get the chat comment

21:41.420 --> 21:48.800
Xander K says Loki is a hooker I pit myself for the gaming world all right

21:48.800 --> 21:53.280
let's go to another political story here it is same song different verse we

21:53.280 --> 21:57.800
talked about it last week game politics calm ran the story here

21:57.800 --> 22:03.600
Louisiana governor Kathleen babineau signed the video game bill that was

22:03.600 --> 22:07.680
It was co-written by He Who Shall Not Be Named,

22:07.680 --> 22:08.860
and it went into law.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.760
This is the funny thing, it went into law immediately.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.560
There was no January 1st date, November 1st, whatever date.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.580
It went into law ASAP.

22:16.580 --> 22:18.000
By the way, on a side note,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.640
big congratulations to gamepolitics.com

22:20.640 --> 22:22.460
because they're getting a mention

22:22.460 --> 22:24.660
in Entertainment Weekly this week about like,

22:24.660 --> 22:26.220
it's in the section like 100 websites

22:26.220 --> 22:27.620
you should be visiting or something like that,

22:27.620 --> 22:28.700
and they're in there, so.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.420
And I agree, it is a website you should visit

22:30.420 --> 22:31.960
if you're a gamer, so good job.

22:31.960 --> 22:37.480
find it funny you know Louisiana is just rampant with you know basically bad

22:37.480 --> 22:42.080
political decisions where it was you know moving the money for levee repair

22:42.080 --> 22:47.320
to other things but we shout shall not comment on Louisiana's intelligence in

22:47.320 --> 22:53.200
the political world mm-hmm so well don't know what else to say I mean that's not

22:53.200 --> 22:57.720
really a big surprise but it did happen and it is law in Louisiana right now so

22:57.720 --> 23:00.720
Thank God I don't live in the South anymore. I'm sorry.

23:00.720 --> 23:04.720
I mean, I feel... I liked growing up there, you know?

23:04.720 --> 23:09.720
But I'm glad I got away from a lot of the backwards thought that goes on there.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.720
Alrighty. Speaking of backwards thought...

23:12.720 --> 23:14.720
Oh yeah, Jackie Poo.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.720
Yes, you have an article on He Who Shall Not Be Named.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.720
On Mr. Jackass. That's what I'm going to call him from now on.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.720
Either Jackie Poo or Jackass.

23:21.720 --> 23:27.140
So, uh, yeah, um, do you know that actually Jack Thompson is right on a few things?

23:27.820 --> 23:29.500
You know what?

23:29.500 --> 23:35.060
Entertainment there's there's a list up here. Actually. It's actually up on a pointless waste of time

23:35.660 --> 23:42.860
And this is actually sent to us by one of our listeners whose email is hidden somewhere. I'm sorry

23:43.580 --> 23:47.700
For you are leave it to a site called pointless waste of time to find

23:47.700 --> 23:53.020
you know truth in he who shall not be named I think that they're well I look

23:53.020 --> 23:57.800
at it this way he's been twisting reality to suit his own purposes we can

23:57.800 --> 24:01.660
completely just you know show where he is indeed right but also show where he

24:01.660 --> 24:06.060
is wrong in his correctness interesting correctness would have been in quote

24:06.060 --> 24:10.420
fingers by the way except this is radio so you can't see me being awesome so

24:10.420 --> 24:18.120
what okay so yes entertainment can change your personality you know and I

24:18.120 --> 24:22.720
love how it's you know listed here have you ever gotten sad at a movie or listen

24:22.720 --> 24:27.640
to a song that invoked a certain emotional response you know have you

24:27.640 --> 24:32.720
been completely unmoved by any form of art all right I would think like have

24:32.720 --> 24:35.320
you ever seen a movie that you would might think changed your life in one way

24:35.320 --> 24:38.440
or another or change your outlook there's even a point here where they're

24:38.440 --> 24:41.600
saying you know actors and actresses saying you know that they want their

24:41.600 --> 24:47.280
movie to raise awareness on an issue well you know so yeah in that case he is

24:47.280 --> 24:51.980
right it can affect you know but then again you know video games are no

24:51.980 --> 24:58.200
different than a movie then looking at a painting then looking then reading a

24:58.200 --> 25:04.840
book I mean there's a book at Walmart called naked murder but no no one's

25:04.840 --> 25:12.180
crying about that oh heaven forbid you know it's what about you know what about

25:12.180 --> 25:17.900
watching um Hamlet how much murder is in freaking Hamlet how much incest is in

25:17.900 --> 25:23.900
Hamlet okay so yeah that that's completely refuted okay another point

25:23.900 --> 25:27.060
cops have a right to complain well that's true if you're playing a game

25:27.060 --> 25:30.060
where someone's going around killing cops if I were a police officer that

25:30.060 --> 25:34.780
would make me a little I do that it's like the anti lawyer killing game a

25:34.780 --> 25:38.660
lawyer we go huh or if it's like someone goes into a call center and kills

25:38.660 --> 25:43.900
everybody I'd be like stay away from my cubicle you know so on that point of

25:43.900 --> 25:48.300
view yeah they have a right to be upset you know wouldn't you be if someone we're

25:48.300 --> 25:54.820
going around you know hacking off you know people who do what you do um sorry

25:54.820 --> 25:57.840
just different songs from my childhood popped into my head suddenly can I

25:57.840 --> 25:59.860
Can I interject a little chat room humor in here?

25:59.860 --> 26:00.860
Sure.

26:00.860 --> 26:05.600
Fireboma says, in response to, you know, emotional response to art, Fireboma says, you mean how

26:05.600 --> 26:08.960
like certain music makes cowards cut themselves?

26:08.960 --> 26:09.960
Yeah.

26:09.960 --> 26:10.960
Emo.

26:10.960 --> 26:11.960
Yeah.

26:11.960 --> 26:21.420
So, uh, now this is where he's wrong, is that, um, I mean, basically, there's not too many

26:21.420 --> 26:23.360
games out there that really point that out.

26:23.360 --> 26:29.680
I mean, you can, your games have a point.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.480
You're supposed to accomplish certain goals in it.

26:32.480 --> 26:37.940
You know, like Snipe's putting out in Grand Theft Auto, you have a choice to either go

26:37.940 --> 26:42.200
out and commit all these crimes, or you can go through the game without doing any of that.

26:42.200 --> 26:47.400
It's not probably as much fun, but you do have the option of not doing it.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.060
I gotta play Devil's Advocate here for a minute.

26:49.060 --> 26:52.880
What about a game like, cause I just was playing this earlier today, Burnout, where I'm encouraged

26:52.880 --> 26:56.680
to slam into other cars and I get more points when I do so and that's really the only way

26:56.680 --> 26:57.680
to win the game is to...

26:57.680 --> 26:59.600
Are you gonna go out on the road and slam your car into it?

26:59.600 --> 27:01.320
No, because I'm not a fucking idiot!

27:01.320 --> 27:03.560
Okay, point taken.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.280
But it's still a choice, right?

27:05.280 --> 27:06.280
I guess.

27:06.280 --> 27:09.800
In that one you're forced into that circumstance, but in real life you're not forced into doing

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
it.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.360
If I wanted to drive my car through, you know, rush hour traffic the wrong way and slam into

27:14.360 --> 27:18.640
everybody I could, I wouldn't need a video game to probably make me do that.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.040
You know, something's wrong with me anyway.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.560
need another x chromosome

27:25.560 --> 27:28.520
another point was that games appeal to the worst

27:28.520 --> 27:32.040
of the worst in us moving on

27:32.040 --> 27:35.120
well more specifically teenage boys but you know

27:35.120 --> 27:38.840
yeah they make profit from dead or alive and from other games that are going to

27:38.840 --> 27:40.240
appeal to

27:40.240 --> 27:43.200
your average young man you know

27:43.200 --> 27:45.320
this is my favorite favorite point

27:45.320 --> 27:48.520
this is where he's wrong and it's it's the chart from the u s department of

27:48.520 --> 27:52.900
justice showing crimes going down since the early 90s in fact it's quite a

27:52.900 --> 27:58.920
significant plummet in fact I'm gonna link the the image to the chat room so

27:58.920 --> 28:03.040
they can look at this because I think that this is pretty pretty awesome it's

28:03.040 --> 28:09.840
basically showing how I mean and it's a pretty severe drop it's crazy if you

28:09.840 --> 28:15.600
look at it it's gone from over from the you know 40 50 million range I'm sorry

28:15.600 --> 28:23.380
sorry 50,000 range to dropping down under the 20s so yeah Jack needs to get

28:23.380 --> 28:27.020
his head out of his ass and live in the real world with the rest of us not every

28:27.020 --> 28:31.220
game also has a message to it I mean pac-man isn't like you know

28:31.220 --> 28:37.020
demonstration of you know drug abuse or anything like that it's just it's a game

28:37.020 --> 28:41.940
you do stuff that's it I mean Grand Theft Auto is in a game about murdering

28:41.940 --> 28:46.780
people to teach you about how to go out and be a successful killer it's a game

28:46.780 --> 28:51.460
with the story that's it I mean sometimes games are just simple like that

28:51.460 --> 28:56.260
stop trying to read way too into things that's why I think a lot of people have

28:56.260 --> 29:01.020
you know problems doing it's just you know just enjoy a game for being a game

29:01.020 --> 29:04.900
you know it's fiction because it's a goddamn game they don't look real until

29:04.900 --> 29:09.420
we get to like Grand Theft Auto 6 or whatever you know maybe even for you

29:09.420 --> 29:17.220
whenever the new game on PlayStation 4 or 5, whenever you get graphics that good.

29:17.220 --> 29:20.660
But right now, they don't look anything realistic, I mean...

29:20.660 --> 29:24.540
Well that was the next point I was coming up to, is that he was saying that basically

29:24.540 --> 29:30.020
the games are, you know, teaching us in the future that, you know, we're gonna all grow

29:30.020 --> 29:35.260
up in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone's handling guns and killing each other.

29:35.260 --> 29:38.300
But it's also showing the progression of basically graphics.

29:38.300 --> 29:41.820
have pixel girl then you have you know like dead or alive and then you have you

29:41.820 --> 29:44.780
know in the future games are gonna look pretty freaking realistic you know and

29:44.780 --> 29:47.820
there's already games now it's hard to tell the difference the holodeck you're

29:47.820 --> 29:51.700
gonna have a holodeck peep there will not be any violence when the holodeck

29:51.700 --> 29:55.940
comes around because everyone will be having sex in the holodeck that is

29:55.940 --> 29:59.540
exactly what's gonna happen fuck the violence everyone's just gonna be

29:59.540 --> 30:05.140
getting laid all the time all the friggin time I can continue with this

30:05.140 --> 30:11.180
please yes now there's a book that's called teaching kids to kill that's

30:11.180 --> 30:15.100
written by a military expert who says first-person shooter games are going to

30:15.100 --> 30:22.540
basically desensitize kids to you know murder well tell me does a you know do

30:22.540 --> 30:27.180
you learn how to clean your gun how to aim how to fire how to pull the trigger

30:27.180 --> 30:32.060
proper gun maintenance how to actually hold the weapon do first-person shooters

30:32.060 --> 30:36.500
actually teach you how to do that they will when NRA the game comes out in

30:36.500 --> 30:40.740
August I could learn all that from a civil war reenactment you know you can

30:40.740 --> 30:46.300
go to a freaking firing range have them show you how to do the gun and then

30:46.300 --> 30:49.820
shoot it off at you know a bunch of targets why are they coming after like

30:49.820 --> 30:57.420
live ammo area 51 you know or maximum enforce or whatever the hell was the last

30:57.420 --> 31:00.580
point is that there are real murders linked to games you know they're saying

31:00.580 --> 31:04.900
you know there was that kid who same said that Grand Theft Auto 3 made him

31:04.900 --> 31:09.640
kill people and like one case I think in Japan where they were saying it so what

31:09.640 --> 31:13.580
about this is the point that I like so what about all of the murders that

31:13.580 --> 31:17.080
happened before the game came out did it make them do that too you know and I

31:17.080 --> 31:20.860
think this is great okay they're saying with GTA 3 this is 7 million copies

31:20.860 --> 31:24.860
worldwide and say that another million were pirated and just quoting off the

31:24.860 --> 31:29.060
site here so that means that when you have all of those cases the number of

31:29.060 --> 31:32.280
of murders actually blamed on Grand Theft Auto 3,

31:32.280 --> 31:35.280
out of four million users, it would be.00003%.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.600
Where's this article again for our listeners to check it out?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.080
It's at pointlesswastetotime.com

31:43.080 --> 31:45.760
slash games slash censorship dot HTML.

31:45.760 --> 31:46.800
Read it, definitely read it.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.120
This is like one of the single best articles

31:49.120 --> 31:50.360
I've seen in a long time.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.080
All right, awesome.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.520
Loki, we're gonna go over to Loki

31:53.520 --> 31:56.560
who has some news about a game that it can't,

31:56.560 --> 31:58.200
there can't be anything wrong with this game.

31:58.200 --> 32:04.520
Even the fundamentalist, the most crazy people I don't think could find anything wrong with

32:04.520 --> 32:05.520
this game.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.520
Right, Loki?

32:06.520 --> 32:10.080
I dropped a crate on somebody and Luminous made me do it and I killed somebody.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.080
My bad.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.080
My bad.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.080
Damn those games.

32:13.080 --> 32:18.640
Anyways, there was an interview with Tetsuya Mizuguchi from Game Informer, actually, and

32:18.640 --> 32:22.960
he was talking about kind of where he's taking this series and how Luminous 2 is going to

32:22.960 --> 32:24.600
be different from Luminous 1.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.600
Really?

32:25.600 --> 32:27.560
Because E3 didn't show any of that.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.680
Okay, well this will explain it.

32:29.680 --> 32:36.880
Luminous 2 is going to have a more diverse soundtrack, otherwise it's exactly the same.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.280
Aw, you just lost so many cool points.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.200
You're going to love this though, it's going to get worse.

32:44.200 --> 32:50.200
They're talking about Luminous Live a little bit and they were saying what content there

32:50.200 --> 32:53.960
may be to download and stuff for it and obviously there's going to be lots of stuff, but one

32:53.960 --> 32:58.120
the things that they were playing on doing is you download the game and you gotta pay

32:58.120 --> 33:08.120
extra for multiplayer. You gotta buy the multiplayer. For the game. You have got to be kidding.

33:08.120 --> 33:15.240
No I'm not. Where's this article? This is on Game Informer. Dot com. That bastard. So

33:15.240 --> 33:20.000
um, isn't that wonderful? But um, you know what? A big hearty fuck you to these people

33:20.000 --> 33:24.960
because seriously, they're crack dealers, this is what they're doing.

33:24.960 --> 33:31.420
They put out the first game for a low price on the PSP, and now that we're all addicted,

33:31.420 --> 33:34.720
we want more smack, they're going to start charging us out the ass for it, and I bet

33:34.720 --> 33:37.480
you a multiplayer is not the only thing they're going to charge for, they're going to charge

33:37.480 --> 33:40.680
for each additional song, you want any of the cool licensed songs, you're going to have

33:40.680 --> 33:41.680
to pay for it.

33:41.680 --> 33:42.680
Jerks!

33:42.680 --> 33:48.560
And I will pay for every single one because I'm sad and addicted.

33:48.560 --> 33:53.180
I know, but they're going to say that it's going to have some pretty diverse music.

33:53.180 --> 33:57.880
They're talking about being able to download individual songs including Madonna and stuff

33:57.880 --> 34:03.540
and that you can actually customize which songs you have to groups like 70s, 80s, summer

34:03.540 --> 34:04.540
holidays.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.540
Gotta pay the royalties somehow.

34:06.540 --> 34:07.880
Yeah, exactly.

34:07.880 --> 34:11.700
And they're saying though that they're going to be probably having some exclusive music

34:11.700 --> 34:17.400
for different regions and whatnot.

34:17.400 --> 34:22.680
When I saw that about the multiplayer thing, that was really kind of disappointing, you

34:22.680 --> 34:23.680
know?

34:23.680 --> 34:27.400
So, I don't know.

34:27.400 --> 34:31.740
I have to go to chat room because they're being really funny right now and our old buddy

34:31.740 --> 34:36.200
Bobby Black Wolf's in there and he's saying, did you hear the story, and it's not in our

34:36.200 --> 34:39.260
show world for tonight, but maybe you guys heard about all the DS lights that got stolen

34:39.260 --> 34:40.620
in Hong Kong.

34:40.620 --> 34:45.680
He says, well, Luminous, the crate stealers were influenced by Luminous, so ban Luminous

34:45.680 --> 34:47.040
in Hong Kong.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.600
That's it.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.520
So here's exactly where it says right there.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.640
This is the question.

34:52.640 --> 34:53.640
Game form.

34:53.640 --> 34:56.600
Will you be able to play Luminous Live against other people online?

34:56.600 --> 34:58.520
We are currently working on a versus mode.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.120
Puzzle mode will be two players online.

35:01.120 --> 35:04.600
Okay, so you can play two players, I guess.

35:04.600 --> 35:12.040
If you do purchase a versus mode, every mode will have a price, but they won't be high

35:12.040 --> 35:13.040
priced.

35:13.040 --> 35:20.000
the basic package of luminous live and then you add versus mode to it so at

35:20.000 --> 35:24.080
least there's a way at least that's the way we have it planned right now we're

35:24.080 --> 35:28.880
still trying to determine a full package versus in with the basic package yeah

35:28.880 --> 35:37.160
you better because that's really stupid if you don't I'm just upset I don't know

35:37.160 --> 35:43.360
what else to say dark dark Sakura let's go over to I'm sorry was that it was

35:43.360 --> 35:46.840
there more is it okay oh it might be coming to the PlayStation 3 and we

35:46.840 --> 35:50.920
depending on how well those systems do big shocker there that's not a big shock

35:50.920 --> 35:55.200
dark Sakura this is somewhat of a big shock I don't know I've never seen

35:55.200 --> 36:00.520
anything like this before have you I've seen it not in this country basically

36:00.520 --> 36:06.000
you know how in Japan you have vending machines for everything right from beer

36:06.000 --> 36:12.320
vending machines to use panty vending machines to Sony's vending machines well

36:12.320 --> 36:16.920
guess what they're experimenting with the vending machines outside of Japan

36:16.920 --> 36:25.280
apparently they've got a test vending machines out now on a limited run and

36:25.280 --> 36:29.700
they're going to be actually adding about seven more US locations at

36:29.700 --> 36:34.520
airports and various places but they're also considering opening some of these

36:34.520 --> 36:41.280
up in the UK too so I mean base basically the cards are supposed to be

36:41.280 --> 36:45.380
they use debit and credit cards so where you put it in pick what you want pull it

36:45.380 --> 36:49.000
out that charges your card so am I gonna be able to buy on these machines like

36:49.000 --> 36:56.680
PSPs you can get PSPs digital cameras CD players games DVDs basically they're

36:56.680 --> 37:00.940
calling them robotic stores UMDs maybe this is maybe this is Sony's way to

37:00.940 --> 37:02.900
to finally abreast some life in UMDs.

37:02.900 --> 37:07.420
No, they've got these, they're starting to put them in train stations and they're actually,

37:07.420 --> 37:08.420
we sell to them our distribution company.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.980
There's an iPod vending machine in the Metreon, why not Sony one?

37:10.980 --> 37:13.820
I was going to say, that's probably where Sony got the idea for it.

37:13.820 --> 37:14.820
Well...

37:14.820 --> 37:15.820
Oh, they've already had it in Japan for a while.

37:15.820 --> 37:16.820
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:16.820 --> 37:21.100
Where Sony saw that it could be successful is because Apple's having big success with

37:21.100 --> 37:24.340
their iPod vending machines and when I first heard about that, I think it was actually

37:24.340 --> 37:28.860
when your buddy Tiara in Vegas was talking about there was an iPod vending machine at

37:28.860 --> 37:33.820
Hilton there or something and I was like really that's like the only I put a

37:33.820 --> 37:37.300
dollar for candy I can't imagine putting a hundred dollars in the vending machine

37:37.300 --> 37:41.400
here's the only thing I guess the only thing I have a problem with and this

37:41.400 --> 37:44.380
happens all the time I hate when you put dollar in the vending machine and your

37:44.380 --> 37:49.100
chips get stuck what's gonna happen if I pay for a PSP and the fucking PSP gets

37:49.100 --> 37:53.540
lodged in there I'm gonna be pissed I think they have I think they'd be like a

37:53.540 --> 37:57.700
robotic arm something because they wouldn't want to drop right expensive

37:57.700 --> 38:02.500
machinery down a little hole. There's got to be a weight trigger or something

38:02.500 --> 38:05.700
because even the fancy food vending machines now have a weight trigger that

38:05.700 --> 38:10.420
so when the food hits the bottom it knows that something hit it. But so far

38:10.420 --> 38:16.380
the testing locations are in California, Georgia, and Colorado and I actually I

38:16.380 --> 38:19.780
think that you can on Sony's side I think they might have a location listing

38:19.780 --> 38:23.740
but I haven't had an opportunity to check that yet but I'm sure you can find

38:23.740 --> 38:31.660
something on Sony's website probably gonna be like LA Atlanta Denver and if

38:31.660 --> 38:34.980
you want to submit a picture of yourself kicking a Sony vending machine we'll put

38:34.980 --> 38:38.940
it in our orange laundry not that we endorse it no don't actually make a

38:38.940 --> 38:42.140
obscene gesture toward it or actually kick it but if you want to take a

38:42.140 --> 38:45.300
picture of your foot up next to it you know like you're gonna kick it kick an

38:45.300 --> 38:48.100
ultra kick yeah I'm gonna kick the ultra Kate a while back so now we'll do kick

38:48.100 --> 38:51.260
the Sony vending machine I'll tell you what I'll tell you what the the top

38:51.260 --> 38:55.260
photo will win something that I'll decide at a later date.

38:55.260 --> 38:59.260
The Sony vending machine actually isn't a vending machine, it's actually the PlayStation 3 case.

38:59.260 --> 39:03.260
Let's keep it moving.

39:03.260 --> 39:07.260
Also, speaking of the PlayStation 3,

39:07.260 --> 39:11.260
there was a pretty funny observation made this week

39:11.260 --> 39:15.260
on the PlayStation 3, and it kind of dates back to E3, but

39:15.260 --> 39:19.260
somebody was going through their E3 pictures, looking at the pictures of the Sony controller

39:19.260 --> 39:24.460
for the PlayStation 3 and looked really closely and saw that something was wrong

39:24.460 --> 39:28.300
with the select button on the controller on the prototype there. It didn't say

39:28.300 --> 39:30.980
select and this is the controller that was in like the glass case next to the

39:30.980 --> 39:38.720
PlayStation 3. It didn't say select, it said S-E-R-E-C-T. I heard that was a

39:38.720 --> 39:42.860
Photoshop. You know it probably could have been but I'm gonna go ahead and

39:42.860 --> 39:46.580
name it on the program because it's coming from various gaming blogs out

39:46.580 --> 39:50.340
there so it's news it's a news floating around out there and the fact that

39:50.340 --> 39:54.580
there's several pictures of it from different angles so if it is photoshop

39:54.580 --> 39:58.460
they did a pretty darn good job so I don't know but that's the type of thing

39:58.460 --> 40:03.940
I guess you'd expect to see on engrish.com or something a blatant error I

40:03.940 --> 40:11.420
don't know is anybody asked Sony directly about this who knows that's

40:11.420 --> 40:16.260
silly anyway I Loki how about the Wii controller the Wii controller according

40:16.260 --> 40:24.900
to be a moto not gonna have a microphone he says it would be it would increase

40:24.900 --> 40:28.460
the price of the console too much to justify the inclusion of microphone I

40:28.460 --> 40:32.260
call bullshit though because I mean come on a microphone that small can't cost

40:32.260 --> 40:36.860
anything I mean it's gonna be like a buck or two I mean really it's gonna

40:36.860 --> 40:40.780
cost that much more and even still if they want to say that they're not gonna

40:40.780 --> 40:44.020
put one on there there is a little fucking you know connection in the back

40:44.020 --> 40:49.840
You can pop in a microphone right there. So I'm still saying why doesn't Nintendo just do the Nintendo thing?

40:49.840 --> 40:53.580
And they have it in the got it later. They have a microphone in the DS

40:53.580 --> 41:00.260
It didn't cause that you know portable system to be too expensive. I mean why don't they put the same microphone in there?

41:00.920 --> 41:07.320
It works for that. It's obviously really small. I'm sure it's not costing like 50 bucks to add a microphone

41:07.320 --> 41:12.080
It's a microphone. Aha. Aha all this talk about the DS and Wii connectivity

41:12.080 --> 41:16.080
why couldn't you just use your DS as the microphone because that's it that's

41:16.080 --> 41:19.360
gonna say that you need to have a DS in order to play certain games and they're

41:19.360 --> 41:24.620
not gonna do that so and you could do that for some games I imagine but I

41:24.620 --> 41:29.320
would say why not just they could easily add a microphone to this maybe it's a

41:29.320 --> 41:33.680
space issue because I mean the controller is pretty small but

41:33.680 --> 41:39.980
microphones nowadays in the small electronic devices they're damn tiny and

41:39.980 --> 41:45.900
and I know they can't be too expensive, like a buck or two, really, and that's, you know,

41:45.900 --> 41:51.220
going and buying the parts at Radio Shack, let alone what they get, you know, at cost,

41:51.220 --> 41:52.220
so who knows?

41:52.220 --> 41:56.140
Uh, you will bow to me and our chat room says they need a mic that registers blue without

41:56.140 --> 41:58.260
saying brew, if you've played brain training.

41:58.260 --> 42:04.860
That's voice recognition software, that has nothing to do with, you know, whatever.

42:04.860 --> 42:05.860
Alright.

42:05.860 --> 42:11.260
Uh, Loki, or I'm sorry, no not Loki, we just heard from Loki, Dark Sakura, uh, you have

42:11.260 --> 42:15.060
a story about, kinda, we've been talking about PlayStation 3 and Wii, kinda have a story

42:15.060 --> 42:16.060
about both.

42:16.060 --> 42:21.640
I just might, and in fact, you know, uh, I think that we're not the only ones frustrated

42:21.640 --> 42:24.460
with, uh, the PS3, you know?

42:24.460 --> 42:28.380
I think a lot of developers are pretty, uh, pissed off about it too.

42:28.380 --> 42:32.620
Um, actually a lot of developers are leaving the PS3 to start develop on the Wii, and,

42:32.620 --> 42:34.660
uh, LucasArts is one of them.

42:34.660 --> 42:42.660
Um, there are, uh, actually some rumors that actually they were, uh, printed in the last, uh, EGM are saying that, uh,

42:42.660 --> 42:49.660
you know, so far they're still in the rumor phase, but it seems a lot of the third-party developers are kinda pissed off at Sony and, uh,

42:49.660 --> 42:52.660
have gone over to a system that they're gonna be able to sell more games on.

42:52.660 --> 42:58.660
Um, the games are gonna cost more to develop for the PlayStation 3. It's not viable for them to do business on.

42:58.660 --> 43:06.660
So, uh, a lot of areas are, you know, looking to move over, and they're saying that now LucasArts is one of them who's working on a Star Wars game for the Wii.

43:07.660 --> 43:13.660
They want to take advantage of the controller and the sound, the speaker and the controller.

43:13.660 --> 43:16.660
So basically, think of a lightsaber game.

43:16.660 --> 43:22.660
If that pans out the way it describes there, that's gonna be bad news for Sony.

43:23.660 --> 43:25.660
Sony shot themselves, I don't feel sorry for them at all.

43:25.660 --> 43:30.660
Well, maybe they can win him back. What can they do to win him back? More first-party games.

43:30.660 --> 43:35.660
How about, you know, make a system that isn't complete ass, focus on the games, not what they look like.

43:35.660 --> 43:40.660
More twisted metal, more violent twisted metal. That would be the way to do it.

43:40.660 --> 43:44.660
Guns, violence hookers, Loki. Lots of gun-violent hooker games.

43:44.660 --> 43:49.660
And maybe, I don't know, put out Gran Turismo that's not a port of an older one. That might be a good start.

43:49.660 --> 43:56.120
Alright, going back over to the Wii for a minute, you know, I gotta say, lots of cool

43:56.120 --> 44:01.460
points on Nintendo, and this is just one more kind of to add to that.

44:01.460 --> 44:07.400
Nintendo is showing controllers for the Wii behind closed doors that resemble pads from

44:07.400 --> 44:13.300
the TurboGrafx-16, the Genesis, the NES, get this, they're saying that you can actually

44:13.300 --> 44:17.620
plug these into your Wii controller and use these for the Virtual Console.

44:17.620 --> 44:20.740
Now the problem is this story is a little bit different

44:20.740 --> 44:22.500
the several times I've read about it this week.

44:22.500 --> 44:25.100
Somebody on our forums actually posted a picture

44:25.100 --> 44:27.360
of like all these things in a briefcase or something

44:27.360 --> 44:29.540
saying that you would be able to plug in

44:29.540 --> 44:30.860
your old controller.

44:30.860 --> 44:32.640
So if you have old Super Nintendo controllers

44:32.640 --> 44:34.100
sitting around the house just gathering dust,

44:34.100 --> 44:35.780
you could plug these in, there's gonna be an adapter,

44:35.780 --> 44:37.100
you can plug it into the Wii controller

44:37.100 --> 44:39.060
and use them on the virtual console.

44:39.060 --> 44:41.540
But now other stories I'm reading say that no,

44:41.540 --> 44:44.060
they're making new ones that resemble the old controllers

44:44.060 --> 44:45.860
so we kinda have a little bit of a disconnect there.

44:45.860 --> 44:47.860
so this could all just be a bunch of crap.

44:47.860 --> 44:50.360
Well third party can always come out and create something like that.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.860
Exactly, see third party would probably create it anyway,

44:52.860 --> 44:55.360
but if Nintendo's doing this themselves,

44:55.360 --> 44:58.860
I love the adapter idea for Virtual Console,

44:58.860 --> 44:59.860
but then you kind of think about,

44:59.860 --> 45:03.860
okay well would I be able to use like a Super Nintendo controller on the NES games?

45:03.860 --> 45:07.860
Well why not I guess, but you know Nintendo's gonna have to kind of think all that out,

45:07.860 --> 45:12.360
and how weird is that gonna be to use like a Sega Genesis controller to play a Nintendo game?

45:12.360 --> 45:13.860
How weird is that gonna be?

45:13.860 --> 45:18.580
I don't know, maybe she's me, I don't know, I think it's kind of weird.

45:18.580 --> 45:23.220
Dark Sakura going

45:23.220 --> 45:27.380
into something, going into a virtual gaming system of a different type.

45:27.380 --> 45:31.140
Well, guess what has finally happened?

45:31.140 --> 45:35.020
What's that? We have seen Geometry Wars defeated

45:35.020 --> 45:38.460
by Uno. Wait, wait, wait, whoa, like

45:38.460 --> 45:43.140
like people playing it or what? The Xbox 360 version of

45:43.140 --> 45:48.820
Uno is the highest daily demo-to-sale conversion of any Xbox Live arcade game.

45:48.820 --> 45:56.500
Wow. It even topped Geometry Wars Retro Evolved. Wow. Yep. They, it's like not just

45:56.500 --> 46:02.000
that, apparently it's given it the smackdown. Basically it's about a 40 to 55

46:02.000 --> 46:07.260
cents profit, I think more per sale. Let me look a little bit further. But I mean

46:07.260 --> 46:10.740
but basically they're they're sort of using that now. They can make other card

46:10.740 --> 46:14.940
games and see if that tops no goody now we're gonna get a sea of card games that

46:14.940 --> 46:18.060
are only gonna be mediocre Texas Hold'em's coming in July will you know

46:18.060 --> 46:21.500
people be playing that whoopee there are a lot of poker things I won't be one of

46:21.500 --> 46:25.660
them I think the poker thing is kind of a little overrated but you know what's

46:25.660 --> 46:34.660
even gonna be worse when the Xbox Live vision comes out it's gonna like there

46:34.660 --> 46:40.420
is gonna be so met much wrongness on those cams it's not even gonna be funny

46:40.420 --> 46:42.740
I hope they're awesome. I hope they have a way to moderate it

46:42.740 --> 46:47.340
So I hope you got do you know how many butts are gonna be seen on those cameras give me Xbox Live?

46:47.860 --> 46:55.140
Prostitution you're gonna get strip, you know, you're gonna see eight lines stinging, you know, you know pedophiles on you know life. It's just

46:55.660 --> 46:59.740
It's gonna be great for gaming. It's great publicity. All right

47:01.180 --> 47:05.720
Of course and of course any story on Xbox Live brings the mandatory comment here

47:05.720 --> 47:08.800
Did you know if it says I want Street Fighter on live? When will it come?

47:08.800 --> 47:15.660
Did you like a Microsoft's little cocktease this week? They put up Street Fighter 2 themes and pictures user pictures

47:16.000 --> 47:17.120
No game

47:17.120 --> 47:22.500
So when you go into the art when you go into the Xbox Live and you go into like download new stuff

47:22.700 --> 47:26.880
Street Fighter 2 comes up and you go like holy shit finally and then you go in there and it's

47:26.960 --> 47:32.820
themes and gamer pictures for the low low price of a couple hundred gamer points and you're like son of a

47:34.840 --> 47:36.840
Funny I

47:36.840 --> 47:39.060
Guess maybe they're just trying to build hype. I don't know

47:39.580 --> 47:43.580
We'll see it'll be out when it's out. We don't know anymore. We're not gonna try and speculate anymore

47:44.400 --> 47:46.640
Capcom can give a date and it'll be wrong

47:48.480 --> 47:52.160
Moving on Loki you have a story about Grand Theft Auto 4

47:52.520 --> 47:53.000
Yes

47:53.000 --> 47:54.600
the rumor or

47:54.600 --> 47:58.760
The rumor people are saying out there is that it's gonna be an MMO the reason

47:58.880 --> 48:04.520
one of the reasons now that they're thinking that is because on the Rockstar Norse site they're looking for

48:04.520 --> 48:10.160
for in-game animators, level design, motion editors, and network programmers.

48:10.160 --> 48:14.600
And so they're thinking, ooh, network programmer, that must mean that they're going to make

48:14.600 --> 48:15.720
it an MMO.

48:15.720 --> 48:17.600
I hope the hell not.

48:17.600 --> 48:20.160
Do you know how many people will play as the hooker?

48:20.160 --> 48:23.840
Okay, listen, here's why this will never work.

48:23.840 --> 48:28.420
One, Rockstar does not know how to program multiplayer to save their life.

48:28.420 --> 48:30.840
It is awful when it comes to Grand Theft Auto.

48:30.840 --> 48:35.440
I have not played, you know, table tennis, so I imagine table tennis is fine, but for

48:35.440 --> 48:40.320
Grand Theft Auto, where we're concerned here, it is awful, awful, awful, awful.

48:40.320 --> 48:44.920
There's so many glitches, so much wrong with the game, and I should know because I played

48:44.920 --> 48:49.120
this thing twice a day, every day since the game came out on the PS3.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.180
So awful.

48:50.180 --> 48:55.640
But there's a lot to work on, and they definitely need people to be doing that, plus, I mean,

48:55.640 --> 48:58.280
if you're going to be doing multiplayer in a game like that, it's probably going to be

48:58.280 --> 49:03.340
lot more complex than, you know, Table Tennis was. I don't think this says anything about

49:03.340 --> 49:08.220
it being an MMO, and I don't think that they would start off with an MMO. I don't know.

49:08.220 --> 49:11.900
I don't think it's going to happen. Episodic content? Yes. MMO? No.

49:11.900 --> 49:16.540
I've played Table Tennis online, and it's fine. It plays fluid. It's pretty solid.

49:16.540 --> 49:20.260
Yeah. I wish they had the same people working on, you know, Liberty City stories on the

49:20.260 --> 49:24.460
PSP. Well, I think you're... White City stories better be goddamn perfect.

49:24.460 --> 49:28.580
think Grand Theft Auto 4 will be multiplayer in some capacity or another?

49:28.580 --> 49:32.260
You know what, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't. I'd be, I wouldn't be surprised

49:32.260 --> 49:37.180
if it was live aware, and that's it. Hmm. Because, you know, we thought the same thing

49:37.180 --> 49:43.020
with Liberty City Stories on the PS2, and they tried, and they were unsuccessful to

49:43.020 --> 49:47.440
get it working. So what makes you think they're going to be, I mean, maybe Xbox Live might

49:47.440 --> 49:53.040
be a little bit easier in Playstation 3, but I'm not, I'm not going to be too surprised

49:53.040 --> 49:57.500
if it doesn't have a multiplayer. I would hope, because that'd be awesome, but I don't

49:57.500 --> 49:59.460
think it's gonna.

49:59.460 --> 50:03.420
Comments on Grand Theft Auto Online. VidPala says, it'll turn into The Sims Online, which

50:03.420 --> 50:07.300
you've probably heard us talk about on the show before. Just basically turn into Drugs

50:07.300 --> 50:12.420
and Sex, Sims Online. You Will Bow to Me says, I want to play as the guy who works at the

50:12.420 --> 50:14.860
chicken joint in a Grand Theft Auto MMO.

50:14.860 --> 50:20.900
Well, the multiplayer in the PSP version, I like the modes that they have. If they worked

50:20.900 --> 50:26.460
right it'd be great because you know eight man you know six man teams or

50:26.460 --> 50:30.780
whatever have a perfect you know just doing a simple deathmatch like any other

50:30.780 --> 50:36.540
game doesn't have to be a full-blown no MMO just make the modes work correctly

50:36.540 --> 50:41.620
and then they'll be great all right well speaking of MMOs there's been another

50:41.620 --> 50:44.780
rumor going around the internet this week about Blizzard MMOs and that

50:44.780 --> 50:49.900
Blizzard is gonna turn into like this MMO only company and basically what

50:49.900 --> 50:55.660
happened is that F13.net did some type of presentation to Wall Street and a rep from

50:55.660 --> 51:02.780
Vivendi said, all Blizzard franchises will become MMOs, to which like Starcraft fans

51:02.780 --> 51:07.220
and Diablo fans everywhere pooped their pants simultaneously when they heard this.

51:07.220 --> 51:09.820
Loki, you think there could be any truth in this?

51:09.820 --> 51:16.100
No, because Blizzard actually, when GameSpot questioned them about this whole rumor, they

51:16.100 --> 51:24.180
said, alas for those yearning for a marathon World of Starcraft session Blizzard moved

51:24.180 --> 51:32.620
quickly the quash rumors of any non World of Warcraft MMOs. No, that's just a rumor

51:32.620 --> 51:38.340
in regards to Blizzard. And it says, we believe that rumors circulating about this subject

51:38.340 --> 51:44.100
is based on a misinterpretation of information provided to industry analysts. And if I remember

51:44.100 --> 51:49.500
correctly, um, they had slides that basically showed, you know, potential for these games

51:49.500 --> 51:56.100
to grow in those areas, not necessarily guaranteeing that they will grow in there. So, I dunno.

51:56.100 --> 51:59.340
I'm sure I'm gonna piss off some Blizzard fans by saying this, but I don't care, but

51:59.340 --> 52:03.700
isn't World of Warcraft just Diablo MMO with Warcraft characters?

52:03.700 --> 52:04.700
Pretty much, yeah.

52:04.700 --> 52:09.300
I mean, you already have your Diablo MMO, I don't know what's wrong.

52:09.300 --> 52:13.860
Warcraft maybe, I mean that might be kind of cool I guess, but it'd be pretty much the

52:13.860 --> 52:14.860
same.

52:14.860 --> 52:16.860
At least that's what I think.

52:16.860 --> 52:23.220
Alright, Loki, now speaking of MMOs, we see these stories come up once in a while, but

52:23.220 --> 52:25.660
they're banning more gold sellers, or what's going on?

52:25.660 --> 52:32.300
They've suspended more than 250 accounts, and according to them, they...

52:32.300 --> 52:34.360
Wait, is this World of Warcraft, or is this something else?

52:34.360 --> 52:36.100
This is Final Fantasy XI.

52:36.100 --> 52:48.100
I've suspended 250 accounts and have retrieved some 250 billion in gil that's been removed from circulation as a response to this.

52:48.100 --> 52:50.100
That's a lot of gil.

52:50.100 --> 52:58.100
But I don't believe that each one of those accounts had a billion gil. That's kind of ridiculous.

52:58.100 --> 53:00.100
That's a lot of money.

53:00.100 --> 53:02.100
But yay! Go them!

53:02.100 --> 53:04.100
I don't play that game anymore.

53:04.100 --> 53:08.260
so I know I I saw my account active but and I have

53:08.260 --> 53:11.460
I think 12 days left in the month to decide if I want to keep it or not

53:11.460 --> 53:14.900
I'm kinda I'm kinda leaning towards no. I'm going back to PSO

53:14.900 --> 53:17.940
we'll see oh why that game is so old now

53:17.940 --> 53:21.220
Julie's gonna pay for my account so I can play with her. Well if you're getting it for free I guess you can't go away

53:21.220 --> 53:23.420
what about Phantasy Star Universe that's just around the corner

53:23.420 --> 53:28.980
aren't you girls gonna upgrade? I'm playing World of Warcraft. You signed in and then signed right back out

53:28.980 --> 53:32.700
I had stuff to do. Alright alright

53:32.700 --> 53:36.980
Final Fantasy XI isn't the only game where this is happening.

53:36.980 --> 53:39.340
It is happening in World of Warcraft as well.

53:39.340 --> 53:46.340
Blizzard has banned more than 30,000 accounts during May alone for gold farming.

53:46.340 --> 53:49.820
In keeping with Blizzard's aggressive stance against cheating in World of Warcraft, we

53:49.820 --> 53:54.980
banned over 30,000 accounts in the month of May and with that removed over 30 million

53:54.980 --> 53:57.780
gold from the economy across all realms.

53:57.780 --> 54:02.560
The banned accounts were taking part in activities that violate the game's terms of use, including

54:02.560 --> 54:07.000
using third-party programs to farm gold and items, which severely impacts the economy

54:07.000 --> 54:10.760
of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.

54:10.760 --> 54:16.200
So it looks like there's steps going on in a lot of the big MMOs to boot the gold farmers.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
Kind of interesting.

54:17.200 --> 54:21.920
But what's also interesting about that, let's see, if we take 30 million and divide that

54:21.920 --> 54:28.720
by 30,000, that's 1,000 gold a person about that was taken out of the economy.

54:28.720 --> 54:34.960
I don't know. I know a lot of people who are really really addicted to World of Warcraft at their level 60s that a thousand

54:34.960 --> 54:36.320
gold is

54:36.320 --> 54:42.420
attainable for the normal player, you know, what's funny about all of this, you know, everyone's

54:43.560 --> 54:45.800
Always saying, you know this gold farming 20

54:46.040 --> 54:52.920
It hasn't really had any effect on the prices of gold and I remember every now and then just out of curiosity

54:53.120 --> 54:56.920
I'll go and look over at IGE to see how much they're selling

54:56.920 --> 55:02.880
selling gold for and stuff and the prices just keep dropping and dropping and dropping

55:02.880 --> 55:03.880
and dropping.

55:03.880 --> 55:06.040
I'm not sure if that's because they can't sell it anymore.

55:06.040 --> 55:09.440
I would think because there's more out there, they would have to drop the prices.

55:09.440 --> 55:14.040
Well, what's interesting too about World of Warcraft is there's so many realms.

55:14.040 --> 55:15.460
There's so many realms now.

55:15.460 --> 55:16.460
It's got to be hard.

55:16.460 --> 55:17.460
They added more.

55:17.460 --> 55:20.740
Right, because they added the new one I just started on, Aeri Peak is the one I'm playing

55:20.740 --> 55:25.560
on now, that just opened up over the weekend and with all these servers opening up, these

55:25.560 --> 55:28.960
companies can't possibly be staying on top of it fast enough to get all the

55:28.960 --> 55:38.140
gold. 2 million for 30 bucks. 2 million Gil. Wow. 30 bucks. Crazy. Alrighty let's go on

55:38.140 --> 55:42.960
over to Dark Sakura because she likes to surf the internet up and down and back

55:42.960 --> 55:48.200
and forth and sideways and every which way. I have no life. To find a website that

55:48.200 --> 55:51.200
speaks to her that she wants to share with all of you. It's Dark Sakura's

55:51.200 --> 55:54.860
website of the week and Dark Sakura where should all the kids be pointing

55:54.860 --> 56:01.420
their browsers this week this spoke to my special places it's a site called

56:01.420 --> 56:08.820
I'm sure it did well now no that's stuck in my head because I've been going still

56:08.820 --> 56:13.700
going to like weebles every day is this a show gonna need the explicit tag on it

56:13.700 --> 56:21.460
or no no it's okay last night I was on weebles stuff watching the one of the

56:21.460 --> 56:25.100
Weebl and Bob episodes that had that stuck in my head but anyway that's not

56:25.100 --> 56:27.760
my side of the week that was an old side of the week still awesome site though

56:27.760 --> 56:33.240
the site of the week this time around is eskadub.uncreativity.com the

56:33.240 --> 56:39.280
catastrophe of eskaflowne which is fabulous but the specific specific thing

56:39.280 --> 56:43.480
on here is if you go into their downloads page click on Sephiroth sexy

56:43.480 --> 56:52.600
choir you just have to watch it it's a link to youtube it's sexy roth with

56:52.600 --> 56:58.180
eric's death o vision it it's it's a hilarious video so well done and I guess

56:58.180 --> 57:01.120
it's what there's a couple cosplay it looks like they filmed it in an anime

57:01.120 --> 57:03.940
convention I have no idea where the squall cosplay yeah you can clearly see

57:03.940 --> 57:08.380
a squall play and they're singing the one-wing angel but it's sexy Roth and

57:08.380 --> 57:14.380
he's got a sexy ass. But the death of vision is the best part.

57:14.380 --> 57:18.380
The heiress death of vision is great. My favorite line, way to stand there cloud.

57:18.380 --> 57:24.380
While the choir is singing, just so you guys know, because this is radio so it's hard for us to explain,

57:24.380 --> 57:30.380
but they play that death scene from Final Fantasy 7 over and over again.

57:30.380 --> 57:33.380
Well, we want people to go to the site. I don't want to get into copyright things.

57:33.380 --> 57:39.300
Yeah, but they play that they loop that sequence from Final Fantasy 7 where Eris dies over and over again

57:39.300 --> 57:44.940
And then like put different filters on it like black and white and then trippy color and sepia and all this stuff

57:44.940 --> 57:46.940
This is crazy

57:47.020 --> 57:48.700
That's great

57:48.700 --> 57:50.700
genius pure genius

57:50.900 --> 57:56.260
Congratulations kids. That's like that's my side of the week. I approve of Dark Sakura side of the week. So again the site is

57:56.260 --> 58:04.220
E-S-C-A-D-U-B, eskadub.uncreativity.com. Go click on downloads. You will not regret it.

58:04.220 --> 58:08.320
It will make you fall out of your chair. Do not be drinking Mountain Dew when you watch

58:08.320 --> 58:12.940
this, or it will end up on your monitor. Does it say that on the site? No. Oh, okay. Oh,

58:12.940 --> 58:18.360
that's what happened to you? A friendly warning. Oh. I don't know how I would come up with

58:18.360 --> 58:22.620
that. Alright. Other than I snorted Mountain Dew out of my nose. You're welcome, because

58:22.620 --> 58:27.260
I gave that link to Jamie to begin with. I hate you. But not really, I lied. Hopefully

58:27.260 --> 58:33.540
you had some Windex. Um, Loki, let's talk Guitar Hero. Boy, talk about this game never

58:33.540 --> 58:40.140
calms down. People just love their Guitar Hero. Exactly, and if you love the Guitar

58:40.140 --> 58:45.540
Hero game, you're gonna love the Guitar Hero 3rd party controller being put out by, it

58:45.540 --> 58:50.300
looks sang, and it's called the Shredder. It looks very similar to normal Guitar Hero

58:50.300 --> 58:56.940
guitar except um a little bit more metal i would say the shredder yeah it looks pretty neat i don't

58:56.940 --> 59:03.340
know what do you think um jamie they had it on uh it looks like it's trying to be a really deformed

59:03.340 --> 59:09.100
uh gibson thunderbird i want to smash it on stage i'm sorry the shredder makes me think of

59:09.100 --> 59:15.340
teenage ninja turtles you know maybe all that hardware is for making coleslaw perhaps um

59:15.340 --> 59:23.300
It is quite steep though in price, $48.90 is what the exchange rate ends up being, so

59:23.300 --> 59:28.740
a lot of price for aesthetics.

59:28.740 --> 59:33.300
I would like to point out it took about 3 seconds for somebody in the chat room, Brak2000,

59:33.300 --> 59:34.860
to come up with the punchline.

59:34.860 --> 59:35.980
What will they come up with next?

59:35.980 --> 59:36.980
The Krag?

59:36.980 --> 59:37.980
I'm sorry, the Krang?

59:37.980 --> 59:40.900
The Krag is a different show.

59:40.900 --> 59:47.360
they do a drum game then they'll come out with like the foot oh god that was

59:47.360 --> 59:58.720
oh my god oh god boo get off the show get off ah all right um actually a quote

59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.520
from someone who can't get into the chat room um to the shredder I say tonight we

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:10.360
dine on turtle soup anything else on the show is that was from tiara by the way

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:17.160
anything else on the shredder Loki it looks stupid yeah you know I played my

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:22.360
game like twice and it's it's in collects dust in my corner you know

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.260
what's funny about guitar hero it's a game I play a lot at other people's

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:30.560
houses and places I never play it here ever I don't touch it here ever I play

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.800
it at everybody else's house all the time it's weird it's like the other

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:41.440
people's game I don't know Dark Sakura while you were surfing the internet you

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.280
like to pay attention to what's going on overseas sometimes because it's not just

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.440
all about us here in America but we want to keep our UK buddies in mind as well I

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.040
love our UK buddies and our UK buddies have some new games coming out don't they

01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:01.040
they sure do what's coming out stuff okay to be specific on the stuff on the

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:08.060
23rd we have Full Spectrum Warrior 10 Hammers on PS2, PC, Xbox. We also have Grand

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:12.600
Theft Auto Liberty City Stories on the PS2, Pac-Man World 3 on GameCube, 10-2

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:18.780
Time of the Assassins on PSP and I'll go ahead and jump to the 30th which I will

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.980
be repeating next week but there's also a Def Jam Fight for New York and the New

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:27.800
Super Mario Brothers so that's exciting. New Super Mario Brothers is pretty darn

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.880
cool I think glad you guys are getting it yeah magic kind of wore off after a

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.640
few days I don't know I don't Mario it's it's a good game and all but I don't

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.760
know just kind of Mario is honest yeah I'm more excited about the GameCube with

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.000
a paper mark super paper Mario that looks hot Mario it's hot I noticed

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.360
something today on my new shiny DS light screen yes well with the increase in

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.440
brightness and resolution on it I noticed that if you have the arcade

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:02.680
machine in your house in Animal Crossing, it's Mario versus Luigi on a fighting game.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.520
That is a hell of a lot of detail to notice. Good job. You have no life.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.560
You know what? Hi.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.000
What's coming out for our friends here stateside, Loki?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.480
Whole lot of nothing. Unless you like NFL Head Coach, in which case that's coming out

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.280
on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.480
There's some folks that are into that. We may not talk a lot about sports games, but

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.480
there you go.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.960
I'm not knocking sports games. This is a sports strategy game. You don't get to play the team to get the coach to them

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.160
Oh, it's that's even like some sports fans won't even touch this. Never mind. But anyways, um

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:43.140
Although there is motor GP for which is coming out on PlayStation 2 two more your legends finally making it to PSP and

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:49.980
Legend of Heroes to the prophecy of the moonlight which also coming to the PSP and for your DS fans

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:57.340
Sudoku Mania yay and Break Em All is gonna be coming out and those are pretty

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:01.620
lame. Next week's gonna be some good stuff though. I'm gonna have to get one

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.060
of the games that's coming out even though I don't have an Xbox to play it on.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:11.160
What's that? Krusty demons freestyle motocross. Well I've never heard of this.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:21.160
Okay, this game is like a cross between Tony Hawk, an off-road game, and Flat Out.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.160
Basically, it's like PMX, Triple X with motorcycles, is what it's like.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.160
It's fantastic.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:36.160
You get points for, you know, injuring your rider and it's just really cheeseball.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.160
Alright, I'll tell you what, Logie, since I need to hang on to Oblivion a little while longer,

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.160
I'll let you borrow the big green brick if you want to have an Xbox for a little while.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160
I have my big green brick outside.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.160
Well, I have to pick up the game first, so I'll bring it over and if it, you know, we'll see.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.160
Alright. Sounds fair.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:59.160
Dark Sakura, we were on UK just a second ago and there's actually a story that kind of affects them that you had.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.160
Quite right.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.640
Actually, I can never pronounce this right, if it's Gamasutra, I would assume Gamasutra

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.380
given Kamasutra, but anyway, a series of...

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.480
We like it better that way because it's sexier.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480
It's so hot.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.000
I mean, just special places, anyway.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.480
The video store game, a big retailer in the UK, is going to be changing its return policy

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.760
for software.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.600
Right now, basically, a customer can return a game within 10 days as long as the packaging

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:39.680
is complete, but regardless of whether it's been opened or used, now it's going to have

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:46.920
its own seal on the packaging, and if that seal is broken, you will not be able to return

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.280
it if it's broken within, I believe, 28 days.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280
Hmm.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.680
I'm trying to see if there's a date on there.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.680
Okay.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:03.240
basically I don't see the date when it's actually supposed to be rolling into

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.240
effect so I suppose it's already going into effect there's 700 own and

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:16.320
franchise stores in Europe there's a 23 in the UK alone 81 in continental Europe

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:22.800
and basically a lot of this is enacted because a lot of their profits went from

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.240
20 million pounds to 8.4 million.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.560
That's basically in the series of 12 months

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.720
that ended at the end of January this year.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.440
So basically they're enacting this,

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.120
I'm pretty much guessing to save their financial butt.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.600
All right, hmm.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.480
I'm looking at our chat room here

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.320
and looking at comments to some of the recent things

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.160
we've been talking about.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.160
It's orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.760
if you wanna join in the fun.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.200
Black Wolf wants to point out,

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.040
There is a huge following of management sims, because we were kind of joking about a little

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.040
bit ago.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.120
One of the top games in Europe is a soccer management sim, but that doesn't surprise

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.280
me at all because people are frickin' nuts about their soccer.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.320
Maybe not so much here, like it's really weird.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.300
Here we're not so crazy about soccer, but those that are soccer fans are like really

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.920
crazy about their soccer.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.740
You know, and worldwide people are just nuts, so that doesn't come as a surprise so much

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:16.740
to me.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:21.220
And of course, for you folks overseas, you call it football, we call it soccer, and I

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:22.220
don't know why, but we do.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.220
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.180
Football makes perfect sense.

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.180
Soccer...

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.900
What do you do?

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:31.500
Soccer sounds like an abuse.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.540
Bandit would like to clarify, when I was offering to let you borrow the big green brick, is

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.940
that an Xbox Halo edition?

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.940
Yes, it is.

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.940
That's when I finally caved and bought an Xbox.

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:43.820
That's the one I have, too, when my old Xbox died.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.900
For quite a long time I would not get an Xbox, I thought they were crap.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:52.140
I was, you know, of that school of thought where all the games that were on Xbox was

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:57.060
nothing I was interested in, and then finally I caved right about the time the Halo Xbox

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.300
had come out, and I thought, ooh, it's a pretty green one too, that's even better.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.820
So that's when I finally caved and bought it.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:11.760
Alright, let's keep it moving here, Loki has one more story for this segment, and Bricks

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.160
may or may not be involved in this. Yes, Loki?

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:22.200
That's correct. Uwe Boll challenges you. You, the bad reviewer. No, basically, Uwe Boll

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:28.340
is put out a press release saying that he wants to fight the people that are criticizing

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:34.460
his movie. His position, I am fed up. I am fed up with people slamming my films on the

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:39.500
internet without seeing them. Actually, they do still suck even after you watch them. Many

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:45.260
Many journalists make value judgments on my films based on the opinions of one or two

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:56.100
thousand internet voices. Half of those opinions come from people who have never watched my

01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:03.420
films. I have been told that BloodRayne has a very bad IMDB rating, but how many of those

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:09.460
votes of zero were made before the movie appeared in theaters? The criticisms go on and on.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:15.460
Okay, first off, they kind of have a pretty good system there where you can't vote until the movie comes out.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.460
So that's kind of invalid.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.460
And two, it's IMDB. Who gives a shit what your rating is on there?

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:24.460
It's a completely subjective website. It has nothing to do with...

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:29.460
It doesn't get published in a paper or something like that. Who cares?

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.460
Well anyways, it goes on.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.940
So, it says, Ooey is now challenging the critics that have failed to watch his films prior

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.380
to reviewing or commenting.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:49.060
To put up or shut up, towards the end of filming Postal, the five most outspoken critics will

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.940
be flown into Vancouver and supplied with hotel rooms.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:58.100
As a guest of Ooey Bowl, they will be given the chance to be an extra slash stand-in in

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:04.880
postal and have the opportunity to put on boxing gloves and enter a boxing ring to fight

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.560
Ui Bull. Each critic will have the opportunity to bring down Ui in a five bout match. There

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.760
will be five matches planned over the last two days of the movie. Certain scenes from

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:21.400
these boxing matches will become part of Postal of the Movie and all five fights will be televised

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.720
on the internet and will be covered by international press. To be eligible however, you have to

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.260
to be a critic that has posted on the internet or written in a magazine or newspaper in the

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:35.820
last or at least two extremely negative articles in the year 2005. Critics of 2006 will not

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:41.440
be considered. Please submit proof of your negative reviews and comments via email to

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:49.360
info.bull.kq.edu.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.700
So you're being rewarded for bashing Ooey Bull films by being in an Ooey Bull film?

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:58.020
He's going to box you, but here's the thing that he forgot to mention.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.100
He used to be a boxer, so that's not exactly fair.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:06.820
By the way, you have to weigh between 140 and 190 pounds in order to do this.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.180
Because I was going to make you do this.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.300
For the sake of the show, I was going to have you do this.

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.300
Okay, well here's the thing.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.500
I haven't written too bad reviews.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.620
We could do the magic of television.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:17.620
We can make it happen.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.620
We can make it happen.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.140
But you're too fat.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:25.420
I could lose the waiting time.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.220
I can't do it either.

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.700
You want to do it?

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.980
You know what?

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:34.220
I bet having a chick put her application in there, I bet that would be, you want to do

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.220
it?

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.340
For the sake of the show, you want to fight him?

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.340
She's grinning.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:44.620
I'll do it and I'll watch his movies so I can be critical of them.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.540
I wasted those four hours.

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.080
I want you two to figure it out.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.960
one of you two is gonna put in the application because I can't I'm too fat

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:59.000
to fight him but to be perfectly honest I actually I'll do it chronic fatigue be

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.820
damned kick his ass I'll do it and we'll try to do it I guess okay and I guess

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:08.800
I'll have to learn the box in the meantime because yeah actually I one of

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.540
my old fitness classes I was in was actual boxing with a bag you know the

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:19.780
boxing training and boot camp training that was fun

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.020
it looks like our chat room approves so we'll see so we're gonna see what we can

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:27.620
do to put together an application. I'm supposed to be joining a gym next week

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:36.220
maybe I can lose the weight then fatty thanks ass and on that note we're gonna

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.820
go ahead and call it you know I'm just kidding I'm just giving you a hard time

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.980
I tease because I love street fight not boxing. It should be you know full

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.720
Contact doing I've dropped three pounds by eating whatever I want

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:55.060
Of course it's like little bits of everything. What's it? What's it called the fuck it diet? Yeah, it's the fuck it diet

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.580
I like that idea. You just stop when you're not hungry. All right

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:02.540
Anyway on that note we're gonna end this segment. We're gonna go to a little bit of a break here

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.380
