WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
Weíre going to start tonightís AfterbirthÖ Nellie, get back in here Nellie right now.

00:08.200 --> 00:12.720
Nellie walked in here because she heard the outro going and she wanted to show Loki what

00:12.720 --> 00:13.720
she bought.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.840
What did you get here?

00:14.840 --> 00:18.320
Welcome to the Afterbirth by the way boys and girls, this stuff is too hot to podcast.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.680
What did you get here?

00:19.680 --> 00:21.080
I got a pink helmet.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
A pink?

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Itís a bike helmet?

00:23.080 --> 00:24.080
Yes.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.080
Why?

00:25.080 --> 00:29.480
Because Iím a Jordan and if I fall I donít want to hurt myself.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.020
You bought a pink bike helmet for no reason?

00:32.020 --> 00:33.020
Yes.

00:33.020 --> 00:36.420
I know, I bought it for a reason.

00:36.420 --> 00:37.420
Why?

00:37.420 --> 00:38.420
Hold on, I'll be right back.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.420
I guess they can't see on the radio.

00:40.420 --> 00:41.420
No, they can't see on the radio.

00:41.420 --> 00:42.420
Who cares?

00:42.420 --> 00:43.420
It's the afterbirth.

00:43.420 --> 00:44.420
It's not the real show.

00:44.420 --> 00:48.420
Tell Miklotov he needs to get in here too.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.860
Miklotov is going to make his way back in here too.

00:50.860 --> 00:51.860
You bought roller skates?

00:51.860 --> 00:53.860
Yes, I don't know how to.

00:53.860 --> 00:55.220
Hold on, we need to get her on mic.

00:55.220 --> 00:56.220
You bought roller skates?

00:56.220 --> 00:59.340
Yeah, I don't know how to do it, so Christopher was going to teach me.

00:59.340 --> 01:04.060
and he tried to teach me a target but I almost fell on him. Why did you buy rollerblades?

01:04.060 --> 01:07.980
She bought rollerblades. Now we're playing rollerblading though, because I have rollerblades in my trunk.

01:07.980 --> 01:11.140
Watch your ankles though, because that will be hard on your ankles.

01:11.140 --> 01:17.060
It'll probably be hard on a lot of things, that's why I need the helmet.

01:17.060 --> 01:21.020
Because I'll fall on my butt.

01:21.020 --> 01:24.220
I bought knee pads

01:24.220 --> 01:29.260
and elbow bobbers. Christopher made me, I didn't want to.

01:29.260 --> 01:32.620
But if she falls, she's gonna hurt somebody.

01:32.620 --> 01:33.620
Uh-huh.

01:33.620 --> 01:34.620
That's the whole point.

01:34.620 --> 01:37.100
I wanted pillows for my entire body.

01:37.100 --> 01:39.820
I wanted pillows for my entire body.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.380
Cause I feel that's the safest.

01:41.380 --> 01:44.460
Anybody want to go rollerblading with me?

01:44.460 --> 01:45.460
I can do that.

01:45.460 --> 01:46.820
I have rollerblades in my car.

01:46.820 --> 01:48.460
Everybody's invited.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.460
The more people to hold me.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.660
Orange Launch Radio goes to the roller ring.

01:51.660 --> 01:54.860
Actually I want to get like regular streetskates again cause I used to have streetskates.

01:54.860 --> 01:58.220
I can't use in-lines because of my ankle because of my

01:58.220 --> 02:02.020
an old injury I had to my ankle. Now they say I can have roller skating sex.

02:02.020 --> 02:05.860
That's uh... That's not easy.

02:05.860 --> 02:09.300
That's nice! That's very nice. Where's Mikotov? Is he here?

02:09.300 --> 02:13.020
Where the hell is he? I know he was in the living room.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.300
Is he playing Silent Hill with Annie? It is. I'm gonna go get him. You guys feel time.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.340
That's a natural. All of these are so photoshopped.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.980
It's pointing the wrong way.

02:21.980 --> 02:23.040
It is.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.380
Yeah. Either that or he's got problems.

02:25.380 --> 02:29.660
So Nellie got Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy, for those who are not

02:29.660 --> 02:31.660
aware, those are porno books.

02:31.660 --> 02:35.900
I bought them! Including Beauty's Release, Beauty's Punishment, and the

02:35.900 --> 02:37.900
Claiming of Sleeping Beauty.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.540
I've read the first one.

02:40.540 --> 02:45.060
I know it's porno because she has a nipple showing on the front cover.

02:45.060 --> 02:48.180
She wrote it under a pseudonym. It's not porno, it's erotica.

02:48.180 --> 02:58.180
Miklotov was supposed to come on and yell at people who didn't like Bahmani in the U.S., but he pussied out, so forget what I said in chat. Sorry guys.

02:58.180 --> 03:00.180
Not my fault though.

03:00.180 --> 03:04.180
My name's Miklotov and I'm a big chicken.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.180
Alright, I want to do Ask Anelli.

03:06.180 --> 03:10.180
Alright, fine. And you field the questions while I set up Cage Match here.

03:10.180 --> 03:12.180
Feel free to ask questions.

03:12.180 --> 03:14.180
And...

03:14.180 --> 03:16.180
Go.

03:16.180 --> 03:20.180
Now ask questions. This is new something. Ask Nelly a question.

03:20.180 --> 03:24.180
Let's ask Nelly questions.

03:24.180 --> 03:28.180
Nelly, do you like your books?

03:28.180 --> 03:32.180
Yes, I love books.

03:32.180 --> 03:36.180
Other than what?

03:36.180 --> 03:40.180
You didn't play any other video games?

03:40.180 --> 03:44.180
No. I don't play video games.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.940
yes I played Tetris a little bit okay

03:47.940 --> 03:52.700
but you got the level 16 number dual I know and 17 is the achievement and I've

03:52.700 --> 03:53.140
lost

03:53.140 --> 03:57.220
yes why did you earn me my damn achievement that's why I need to work

03:57.220 --> 04:01.180
what do I keep cuz he beats me seriously if

04:01.180 --> 04:04.380
please help if you can

04:04.380 --> 04:08.020
questions

04:08.020 --> 04:11.660
what did you have for dinner Nellie I had

04:11.660 --> 04:16.300
um one of those for scottish sandwiches from wendy's it was the turkey and swiss

04:16.300 --> 04:19.260
and i got it with no mayo and i got a side salad

04:19.260 --> 04:23.580
with low-fat honey mustard dressing and a diet

04:23.580 --> 04:28.940
coke and then christopher just gave me an apple because he's awesome

04:28.940 --> 04:33.420
and um question and doesn't that the other question was have you ever gone

04:33.420 --> 04:37.580
skydiving which i know is no and there's no questions for me you don't

04:37.580 --> 04:41.500
speak for me you should have a brownie bite where

04:41.500 --> 04:48.500
did the bad man touch you? Everywhere. That's about right. I eat whatever the crap I want

04:49.540 --> 04:54.600
diet now. Nellie, what is your opinion on boobs? I love boobs. You know whose boobs

04:54.600 --> 05:00.740
I really like? Jessica Alba's. She has a no nudity clause and that really sucks. That's

05:00.740 --> 05:07.740
cause she's a biznatch. But I don't like what's her face? The redhead with the freckles? Lindsay

05:07.740 --> 05:14.020
Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan, yes, because her nipple is on top, and that's just not right.

05:14.020 --> 05:17.180
It's like on the top of the boob. She was cuter when she,

05:17.180 --> 05:20.940
you know, more chubby and with the red hair. When she was a child.

05:20.940 --> 05:24.540
Because you're a molester. I'm not a child molester.

05:24.540 --> 05:27.780
Lester the molester. She's now, like, anorexic.

05:27.780 --> 05:31.540
And though we're, uh, you know, stupid... Please, please don't joke.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.980
Please don't joke about child molesting, not after the trial I went through this week.

05:35.980 --> 05:44.860
And especially, okay, especially about, what was it, uh, Wilmer Valderrama, whatever, he

05:44.860 --> 05:51.700
has a show on MTV called Yo Mama, to which I said, God damn it, you rip that off of In

05:51.700 --> 05:52.700
Living Color.

05:52.700 --> 05:57.860
And the fact that he's producing this show, he's like, this is my greatest idea ever,

05:57.860 --> 06:02.560
you know, and it's a dumb show to begin with, yet for some reason I watched the final today,

06:02.560 --> 06:09.360
the best trash talker in LA and some retarded, like, white guy who, you know, thinks he's,

06:09.360 --> 06:14.120
you know, black or something, and it's retarded. The funniest part of that show was that the

06:14.120 --> 06:19.280
white guy got $5,000 in cash and he was surrounded by a bunch of blacks and Mexicans. I'm like,

06:19.280 --> 06:23.760
he's not gonna keep that. He's gonna get mugged. Cause they're all behind him, looking at him,

06:23.760 --> 06:30.760
I smell date-crime!

06:32.960 --> 06:35.440
We gotta do the cage match. You wanna sit in on the cage match tonight?

06:35.440 --> 06:39.440
No, I'm gonna go play with my new toys. Alright, have fun with your new toys. Thanks for coming on the show, Nellie.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.720
We appreciate it. Thanks for having me! You're welcome! Bye everybody!

06:42.720 --> 06:46.880
Alright, here we go! Orange Launcher to do the cage match.

06:46.880 --> 06:51.200
Wow, that's loud. The way the cage match works is we put in three songs, so we put in

06:51.200 --> 06:54.920
last week's winner in two new songs, and they do battle!

06:54.920 --> 06:58.960
And in order for them to do battle appropriately, you must be in our chat room, orangeloungeradio.com,

06:58.960 --> 07:02.520
click on chat, and you're going to vote for a winner, and the winner goes into rotation

07:02.520 --> 07:09.000
all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's video game music program, which airs 24 hours a

07:09.000 --> 07:10.320
day on the station.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.720
We are not here, and there's no other live programming going on, such as Jamie's lovely

07:14.720 --> 07:18.520
Tuesday night program, or my own Wednesday night program, which will not be heard this

07:18.520 --> 07:20.960
week because I will be in LA.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.400
Listen to all games instead, because I might make a cameo over there on Wednesday.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.400
Who knows?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.400
Uh, just depends on what I can arrange with work.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.040
Anyway, let's get into tonight's cage match.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.440
Song number one was last week's winner, and it comes to us from a little band.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.320
You might have heard of it before.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.560
Not because Jamie doesn't talk about it every week on the show or anything like that.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.560
Hey!

07:40.560 --> 07:41.560
I don't.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.560
Well, it's true.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.560
Every other show.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.560
Every other show.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.560
Alright, here it is.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.560
You voted it, it won.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.560
Here's a clip of last week's winner.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.560
Song number one, the Gorillas!

07:49.560 --> 07:56.560
Happy Landfill!

08:19.560 --> 08:23.560
You will, well, you ain't from United, no

08:32.560 --> 08:36.560
So follow the light, take care of your eyes

08:37.560 --> 08:41.560
You won't be even seeing and doing your lies

08:42.560 --> 08:46.560
Stand in front of a ship that should never be so

08:46.560 --> 08:51.560
They put a dollar for me and I won't be home

08:51.560 --> 08:55.560
Wait on the happy lapel

08:56.560 --> 09:00.560
Wait on the happy lapel

09:00.560 --> 09:02.560
Alright!

09:30.560 --> 09:39.200
All righty, song number one, Gorillaz with Happy Landfill.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.720
It must successfully beat two new songs to a bloody pulp, and that first song is gonna

09:43.720 --> 09:45.040
come from Loki.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.240
What is your pick tonight?

09:46.240 --> 09:53.880
My song is from Junkie XL again, but this time it's a collaboration with somebody else.

09:53.880 --> 10:03.880
It's actually, um, pretty cool. It's called Nightmare. Or Nightmares, I believe. And, um, well, yeah, it's short. So that's always good.

10:03.880 --> 10:15.880
And I think it sounds like a good, like, DDR song. Maybe even kind of almost similar to, oh, I wanna say, like, maybe Echo Image a little bit.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.880
So this is, uh, Nightmares featuring Infusion.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.280
all right here it is enjoy

10:49.880 --> 10:55.880
Looking across the stars

10:55.880 --> 11:04.880
Feeling, reflecting down the hills

11:04.880 --> 11:10.880
Watching the skies tonight

11:10.880 --> 11:19.880
We lay down, it's all down the stairs

11:19.880 --> 11:33.880
Stand aside, stand aside, stand aside

11:33.880 --> 11:37.880
Swinging in the night of time

11:37.880 --> 11:40.880
Looking past the dangerous signs

11:40.880 --> 11:44.880
Broken crystal realized

11:44.880 --> 11:48.880
Losing color, losing shine

11:48.880 --> 11:51.880
Beautiful destructive art

11:51.880 --> 11:55.880
Holding gracefully apart

11:55.880 --> 11:58.880
Three rises in my head

11:58.880 --> 12:04.880
We'll see the natures from the stars in the air

12:04.880 --> 12:08.880
Looking across the stars

12:11.880 --> 12:16.880
Feeling, reflecting down the hills

12:18.880 --> 12:23.880
Watching the skies tonight

12:23.880 --> 12:31.880
We lay down, it's all down to stars

12:31.880 --> 12:46.880
Storm this life, storm this life, storm this life

12:46.880 --> 12:50.880
Singing in a matter of time

12:50.880 --> 12:54.380
Looking past the dangerous signs

12:54.380 --> 12:57.880
Looking close to realize

12:57.880 --> 13:01.380
Losing color, losing shine

13:01.380 --> 13:05.380
A beautiful destructive heart

13:05.380 --> 13:08.880
Holding gracefully apart

13:08.880 --> 13:12.380
Nothing rises in my head

13:12.380 --> 13:15.380
Wishing ages from the start

13:15.380 --> 13:18.180
What do you see in the mirror?

13:21.780 --> 13:23.780
Down the stairs

13:28.980 --> 13:30.980
Down the stairs

13:30.980 --> 13:58.780
That was song number two tonight, that was Junkie XL with Nightmares featuring Infusion.

13:58.780 --> 14:02.420
go around and see if that song gave us nightmares or very sweet dreams dark

14:02.420 --> 14:13.100

15:06.960 --> 15:35.700
My life is brilliant Your life's a joke

15:35.700 --> 15:45.820
You're just pathetic, you're always broke Your homemade Star Trek uniform really ain't

15:45.820 --> 15:52.580
impressin' me You're sufferin' from delusions of adequacy

15:52.580 --> 16:05.580
You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true

16:05.580 --> 16:16.580
Never had a date that you couldn't inflate And you smell repulsive too

16:16.580 --> 16:22.580
What a bummer being you

16:31.580 --> 16:37.580
Well you just can't dance and forget romance

16:37.580 --> 16:41.580
Everybody you know still calls you

16:41.580 --> 16:52.580
Farty pants, but you always have a job Well, I mean, as long as you still could

16:52.580 --> 17:04.580
work that Slurpee machine You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful

17:04.580 --> 17:14.580
You have fun dressed, eating chips off your chest

17:14.580 --> 17:20.580
While you're playing Halo 2

17:20.580 --> 17:27.580
No one's classier than you

17:27.580 --> 17:38.580
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, loser

17:38.580 --> 17:49.580
You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true

17:49.580 --> 17:56.580
Your dog would much rather play fetch by itself

17:56.580 --> 17:59.580
You still live with your mom and you're forty-two

18:06.580 --> 18:10.580
Guess you'll never grow a clue

18:10.580 --> 18:17.580
When it just sucks to be you

18:40.580 --> 18:45.580
It's been far too long since we've heard him. He is the man, is he not?

18:45.580 --> 18:47.580
He's another album. Weird Al is the man.

18:48.580 --> 18:49.580
Love him.

18:49.580 --> 18:50.580
Gets a 10.

18:50.580 --> 18:54.580
Alright, let's recap so you guys can place your votes.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.580
Here we go, song number one you can vote for tonight.

18:56.580 --> 18:57.580
Gorillaz, Happy Landfill.

19:05.580 --> 19:07.580
And song number two you can vote for tonight

19:07.580 --> 19:17.300
Tonight is Junkie XL with Nightmares featuring Infusion.

19:17.300 --> 19:22.620
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Weird Al Yankovic with Your Pitiful.

19:22.620 --> 19:32.900
Alright, place vote now.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.980
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

19:35.980 --> 19:39.820
We'll tally him up, and we'll see who the wiener is.

19:39.820 --> 19:43.300
And I think I just heard DarkSakura say,

19:43.300 --> 19:44.580
I hope I lose.

19:44.580 --> 19:45.660
That's amazing.

19:45.660 --> 19:46.700
Yep, I hope I lose.

19:46.700 --> 19:47.200
All right.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.660
You want a new song to put in next week,

19:48.660 --> 19:49.780
or you just love Weird Al that much?

19:49.780 --> 19:51.780
I love Weird Al the way it is.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.940
Are you pissed I beat you to it?

19:53.940 --> 19:56.300
Well, no, because I never think to go to Weird Al's site,

19:56.300 --> 19:57.900
except when I'm looking for concerts.

19:57.900 --> 19:58.600
I don't either.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.180
You know how I found out about it?

20:00.180 --> 20:01.740
DDR Freak, of all places.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.140
Random chat, yo.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.860
I do lurk on DDR Freak.

20:04.860 --> 20:09.340
Yes, I do. I very rarely post, ever, but I probably visit it, like, every day and just

20:09.340 --> 20:10.480
kind of read what the kids are saying.

20:10.480 --> 20:15.120
I basically just, uh, since you just put that up there, I've basically linked it to, like,

20:15.120 --> 20:16.120
seven people just now.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.780
Oh, the new song, really?

20:17.780 --> 20:18.780
Download this!

20:18.780 --> 20:24.440
That's great! Well, we'll see, we'll see. There seems to be some anti-Weird Al people

20:24.440 --> 20:25.440
in our chat room, so I don't know.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.440
Okay.

20:26.440 --> 20:29.260
I forgot to mention that I just saw this thing on IGN.

20:29.260 --> 20:32.580
All right, tell us about it. That's good, because I can tally votes when I do that.

20:32.580 --> 20:36.420
Hurry up and get your votes in now, because we don't have time to do it.

20:36.420 --> 20:41.900
I actually have in my possession, and this is such a nerd of me, and we talked about

20:41.900 --> 20:45.940
this a while ago, that they were getting sent out.

20:45.940 --> 20:50.300
I have my Xbox Live diamond card.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.300
Aren't you special?

20:51.300 --> 20:54.020
Great, now what the fuck can you do with it?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.020
I don't know.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.020
Impale people in the head!

20:56.020 --> 21:00.060
I can show people that I'm a member of Xbox Live!

21:00.060 --> 21:29.260
I would just like to point out there are more votes in cage match tonight than I have ever

21:29.260 --> 21:31.260
ever seen in the four-year history of this show.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.260
It's crazy.

21:32.260 --> 21:33.900
I'm having a hard time tallying this up.

21:33.900 --> 21:38.020
You guys need to fill more time.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.020
Amy who?

21:40.020 --> 21:41.020
You know what?

21:41.020 --> 21:42.020
I have...

21:42.020 --> 21:43.020
What?

21:43.020 --> 21:44.020
Air.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.020
A whole lot of it.

21:45.020 --> 21:48.120
Especially dead air, like we're having on the show just to write about, you know, before

21:48.120 --> 21:50.120
I set something in.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.000
Actually, I actually did some purchasing today.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.140
My X-Men fandom has resurged, like, massively, so I picked up one of the new X-Men graphic

21:59.140 --> 22:02.320
novels except I need to go back and pick up the astonishing x-men one because

22:02.320 --> 22:07.360
they're written by Joss Whedon who we all know is the god of sci-fi for giving

22:07.360 --> 22:13.540
us Firefly Joss Whedon is my master now but I think it's funny because he writes

22:13.540 --> 22:16.120
like shadow cat perfectly and he based Buffy off of her I think that's

22:16.120 --> 22:20.280
fantastic yeah I'm a big big nerd so what I love

22:20.280 --> 22:27.000
x-men wow there's actually a lot of businesses that support the Xbox Live

22:27.000 --> 22:32.400
5 diamond card, and they have a whole list of them, um, including, what is it, Hollywood

22:32.400 --> 22:40.200
Video Ace Hardware? Um, there's actually some local businesses for at least me, like the,

22:40.200 --> 22:47.680
um, El Dorado Hills Auto Care, Mind, Body, and Harmony? What the fuck? That's weird.

22:47.680 --> 22:54.600
Alright, I got all the votes tallied up whenever you guys are ready. That was hard. Dave and

22:54.600 --> 23:00.480
busters you can get a $10 free gameplay with uh... ooh now that's kinda cool

23:00.480 --> 23:03.000
I don't like that idea

23:03.000 --> 23:06.380
alright you guys are ready to hear tonight's cage match winner

23:06.380 --> 23:10.360
just to give you an example an idea of how many votes we got tonight

23:10.360 --> 23:13.740
look how far the stars go out there look at that

23:13.740 --> 23:18.100
one song just took the other two out in the field and beat them senseless

23:18.100 --> 23:20.340
I mean seriously I am

23:20.340 --> 23:22.380
sorry to say

23:22.380 --> 23:26.540
that i want to vote for tonight

23:26.540 --> 23:28.060
and that way i'm a little

23:28.060 --> 23:32.820
uh... we're now just uh... swept the vote tonight uh... there were no not to

23:32.820 --> 23:35.980
say so i wanted to didn't weren't completely unloved cuz they did get

23:35.980 --> 23:36.980
quite a few votes

23:36.980 --> 23:39.280
in probably a normal week

23:39.280 --> 23:42.780
so i wanted to might have won it but uh... you guys were nuts tonight we love

23:42.780 --> 23:46.240
the participation and i would be xbox live diamond card

23:46.240 --> 23:47.980
the pes museum

23:47.980 --> 23:51.800
by one admission get the second free

23:51.800 --> 23:56.120
Pez, you're a fan of Pez. I used to be. I used to collect Pez dispensers a long, long

23:56.120 --> 23:59.340
time ago. I bought you some, I got you a Wonder Woman one. I know, and they're all sitting

23:59.340 --> 24:04.760
in a drawer. Aww. But that way the sunlight doesn't damage them, they don't get dust,

24:04.760 --> 24:07.360
so someday I'll take them out and display them. Excuses, excuses. I know. When I have

24:07.360 --> 24:12.280
a house, that's my alphabets. When I have a house. You know, ironically enough, all

24:12.280 --> 24:18.840
this stuff that these services are, they're all like local to us. Like Dublin, they have

24:18.840 --> 24:24.360
have one in Dublin, California that walks up. You receive 20% off your entire bill.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.880
Is it because you put in your zip code before you went into that site?

24:26.880 --> 24:32.040
No. Well, maybe under my membership information or something like that, but I'm just surprised

24:32.040 --> 24:37.720
that they have these small ass companies that are on here. I mean, I would think they'd

24:37.720 --> 24:47.520
just be big name companies and stuff, but there's like Omaha Steaks, they have 1-800-PetMeds.com,

25:17.520 --> 25:20.360
PaintShop Pro 4 for life.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.960
Dude, no way. You know how I was all,

25:22.960 --> 25:27.160
Photoshop sucks! Photoshop sucks! Photoshop sucks! And then I used Photoshop CS.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.520
And I was like, PaintShop Pro sucks!

25:30.520 --> 25:34.540
Especially since PaintShop Pro doesn't recognize the angle sensitivity on my tablet.

25:34.540 --> 25:38.120
Yeah, but for people who can't draw like me, PaintShop Pro 4 is awesome.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.280
Stick figures, yo!

25:39.280 --> 25:40.140
Alright.

25:40.140 --> 25:43.080
I could make a dancing graphic like Jeremy Todd did.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.800
Probably.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.320
Actually, sadly my artistic talent won't even do that.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.120
Loki, you want to get one more thought out there before I...

25:49.120 --> 25:53.280
Oh, I was just going to say, games.com, if you use online site,

25:53.280 --> 25:58.760
$75, if you purchase something over $75, you get $10 off with the card,

25:58.760 --> 26:02.840
or pretty much if you just enter in promotional code, diamonds.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.520
So, there you go, big secret right there.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.840
Uno!

26:06.840 --> 26:07.600
Yeah.

26:07.600 --> 26:12.400
Nintendo Maniac 64 is the first in chat room to say MS Paint,

26:12.400 --> 26:12.920
for the win.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.720
I've done touch-ups and paint.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.760
I use MS Paint at work all the time.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.880
It's great for screenshots.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.600
I have begged and begged and begged.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.760
Look, if I'm doing all this crap for you,

26:20.760 --> 26:22.180
just give me Photoshop so I don't

26:22.180 --> 26:24.320
have to bring my laptop up here to do our flyers.

26:24.320 --> 26:30.040
And so I actually use Microsoft Photo Editor and Paint.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.920
I will website edit in Notepad for life.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
Notepad is awesome.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.360
Chat room FUs, boys and girls.

26:39.480 --> 26:42.320
And we're going to start it off with Mac Man.

26:42.320 --> 26:47.860
My FU is to Apple, my favorite goddamn company. They better not buy Nintendo. They will kill them.

26:47.860 --> 26:51.600
The Bandai Pinpin 2 is not a good idea.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.220
Don't worry, MacMan, it's just dirty rumors from fanboys.

26:54.220 --> 26:58.460
NintendoManiac64 says, FU to the chat room for not answering my question after asking twice,

26:58.460 --> 27:01.100
so I'm asking you people at OLR.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.300
What is the fastest Wipeout and Extreme G game?

27:04.300 --> 27:08.220
I have F-Zero GX and beat AllCups on Master and completed Story Mode,

27:08.220 --> 27:10.640
and several chapters on Very Hard 2. Thank you.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.400
I defer to Loki, because I don't play Wipeout.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.920
I don't know, I haven't really...

27:14.920 --> 27:18.960
I like Wipeout 3, and Wipeout Pure is pretty good.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.680
But those are the latest ones.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.400
Well, that explains why no one answered your question. Nobody played the damn game.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.760
Well, if you're really into...

27:26.760 --> 27:32.960
Well, I'm not sure if this was a very fast game. I remember that Fatal Inertia was supposed to be pretty good on the PS3.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.060
But I heard that that game seemed kind of slow.

27:35.060 --> 27:39.420
I would just wait for Wipeout on the PS3 to come out because it's probably gonna be the

27:39.420 --> 27:40.420
fastest one.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.420
Hey!

27:41.420 --> 27:42.420
No, I just found your photo.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.420
You found my porn?

27:43.420 --> 27:44.420
Did you really?

27:44.420 --> 27:45.420
No, I found your photo.

27:45.420 --> 27:46.420
Oh.

27:46.420 --> 27:47.420
God.

27:47.420 --> 27:48.420
Well, they're probably in there somewhere.

27:48.420 --> 27:49.420
Stop looking for my porn!

27:49.420 --> 27:50.420
Ooh!

27:50.420 --> 27:51.420
Ooh!

27:51.420 --> 27:52.420
Stop it!

27:52.420 --> 27:53.420
What?

27:53.420 --> 27:57.220
You can buy a dozen of Krispy Kreme donuts.

27:57.220 --> 28:00.740
Okay, I swear to God, we're gonna be here till midnight if I don't get moving, people.

28:00.740 --> 28:01.740
Alright.

28:01.740 --> 28:02.740
DarklionXVI wants to...

28:02.740 --> 28:03.740
Now I found it.

28:03.740 --> 28:04.740
Sorry.

28:04.740 --> 28:13.620

28:13.620 --> 28:15.460

28:22.180 --> 28:24.740
oh he shares it i guess so

28:26.580 --> 28:32.740
all right come on i gotta get through this black wolf says f you to yesper well said jeremy todd

28:32.740 --> 28:37.660
one says F you to Loki for no apparent reason. F you my car for having shitty breaks right

28:37.660 --> 28:41.300
now so I have to go get them fixed. F you to myself for not having a podcast again this

28:41.300 --> 28:46.740
week. Damn work is making me too busy. I was supposed to be on his podcast but I'm traveling

28:46.740 --> 28:52.140
next week anyway so we might have to reschedule. I just kind of came to my mind. DJ Tyrant

28:52.140 --> 28:56.220
says F you to work and feeling sick. F you to having to sleep and getting a new job that

28:56.220 --> 29:02.540
requires me to actually get up early. Bandit says I want to send a big F you to the Dallas

29:02.540 --> 29:06.220
mavericks for thinking that they can actually beat the miami heat

29:06.220 --> 29:09.620
hitstun would like to say fuck you to nintendo's wifi connection for not letting the

29:09.620 --> 29:13.000
four of us mario kart ds players in chat connect and play a game

29:13.000 --> 29:15.060
dropping players and shit

29:15.060 --> 29:18.760
dmn would like to say f you to any person under sixteen who plays gunbound

29:18.760 --> 29:21.620
half of you son of bitches act like you just discovered the internet and the other half

29:21.620 --> 29:24.480
think you are so fucking cool for taking a god damn computer game like it's

29:24.480 --> 29:25.540
serious business

29:25.540 --> 29:27.360
i hope you all die in a fire

29:27.360 --> 29:29.600
heart dmn

29:29.600 --> 29:34.400
The Fireboma says F you to Belmont Park for taking $34 of my money.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.360
Go horsies go!

29:36.360 --> 29:41.400
The Ichiban Crush says F you to the bad rental skates I were given that utterly destroyed

29:41.400 --> 29:43.080
my feet when I went ice skating yesterday.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.080
I want to go ice skating.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.660
Funnydale says F you to old people winning the lottery.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.840
There should be an age limit to how old you can be to win the damn lottery.

29:50.840 --> 29:55.740
Winning the lottery when you are 90 is like a blind person buying a car.

29:55.740 --> 29:57.360
Maybe they're going to give the money to their kids.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.360
DJ Pooh Eater says,

29:58.360 --> 30:01.360
F you to the electric company for not supplying us with individual generators

30:01.360 --> 30:04.360
because we had a blackout and I missed the entire Orange Lawn Radio show.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.360
Now I must listen to a podcast and explain it to all the bastards who ask,

30:07.360 --> 30:08.360
what are you listening to?

30:08.360 --> 30:10.360
And they look at me like I'm stupid.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.360
I hate the world, but I less than three O-L-R.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.360
I think he means, he hates the world, but not us.

30:17.360 --> 30:22.360
Ravenstaufen says, F you Nintendo for making Apple-inspired Nintendo DS Lite.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.360
Dark Knight says,

30:23.360 --> 30:26.360
my F you goes to me ending up being broke from the anime convention this weekend,

30:26.360 --> 30:28.100
but it was well worth it.

30:28.100 --> 30:29.300
Anoush says,

30:29.300 --> 30:32.740
F U how in the I 405 when you're traveling

30:32.740 --> 30:35.900
at 75 already you get past like you're standing still

30:35.900 --> 30:39.340
and once you're in the carpool lane you are forced to go 120 miles an hour.

30:39.340 --> 30:42.380
That's what I'm wondering, hello!

30:42.380 --> 30:46.900
Ahrimasen says, F U to the hot weather and making me unable to fast combo on

30:46.900 --> 30:48.020
popin' music.

30:48.020 --> 30:52.260
My sticky hand sticking to the buttons. I have a question for Ahrimasen.

30:52.260 --> 30:56.220
Why does your name does not have?

30:56.220 --> 30:57.700
23rd Magus says,

30:57.700 --> 31:02.800
F you to Hoardside Altric Valley groups on Malstorm. Organizing forty people is

31:02.800 --> 31:05.620
like herding cats, three-legged dyslexic cats.

31:05.620 --> 31:08.980
F you to my computer locking up randomly whenever I play games. F you to whatever

31:08.980 --> 31:12.400
fucknugget thought the second half of Tales of Legendia didn't need voice

31:12.400 --> 31:14.340
acting.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.940
SSJ100Matt says F you to high schoolers and middle schoolers invading all the

31:17.940 --> 31:22.100
malls, movie theaters, and arcade because they're off for the summer. Get jobs, dammit!

31:22.100 --> 31:27.100
And SSG100Matt continues, F you to A-Rod Slump and F you to Kudaragi for not shutting the fuck up.

31:27.100 --> 31:32.100
Blaze says, my F you is to my new boss. She is a bitch. You better hope she doesn't listen to this show.

31:32.100 --> 31:37.100
Xander K says, F you to Microsoft for not putting Conker in the latest release of Backward Compatibility.

31:37.100 --> 31:46.100
Legend of Zaku says, F you to my college for being the dicks that they are, billing me and everyone in my apartment complex almost $1.50 each for community damages that I didn't do.

31:46.100 --> 31:50.100
Dark Tetsuya says, F you to Sky who forgot he'll be a cage match pick.

31:50.100 --> 31:56.780
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to poor designs and anime next to con with an extremely small

31:56.780 --> 32:00.020
game room where the same people sit there and won't leave the games, especially the

32:00.020 --> 32:01.940
DDR machine and 2DX.

32:01.940 --> 32:06.780
Also there was no room for the video room so I couldn't see the movies.

32:06.780 --> 32:12.140
Bandit says F you to the furry convention that was held in Pittsburgh this past weekend.

32:12.140 --> 32:15.540
Another F you to Raven's Dolphin for hating the Miami heat says Bandit.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.260
Ooh snap, we got a...

32:17.260 --> 32:20.260
Okay, we are not having freakin' sports chat.

32:20.260 --> 32:26.020
Last F.U. Jeremy Todd1 says F.U. Ravenstaufen for making that F.U. because the DS Lite is

32:26.020 --> 32:29.760
sexy.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.760
That's it, kids.

32:30.760 --> 32:31.760
We gotta go.

32:31.760 --> 32:32.760
I love my DS Lite.

32:32.760 --> 32:36.260
We gotta wrap it up and get out of here because we have business to tend to.

32:36.260 --> 32:37.480
No, I'm just hungry.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.340
There's stuff to be done.

32:39.340 --> 32:43.100
Macman sent me a private message saying you have PC porn, you know you love it.

32:43.100 --> 32:46.380
I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean, but okay.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.940

32:49.940 --> 32:54.500

33:02.780 --> 33:08.100

33:08.100 --> 33:12.140

33:12.140 --> 33:16.180

33:16.180 --> 33:19.200
this computer for I don't know how many years I've never got a virus ever ever

33:19.200 --> 33:25.440

33:25.440 --> 33:33.120

33:37.360 --> 33:41.000

33:41.000 --> 33:45.220
future of orange lounge radio I mean it's big stuff guys the world hangs

33:45.220 --> 33:48.940
Because Secretly Dark Soccer and I are going to murder Loki tonight and then that will

33:48.940 --> 33:49.940
change the future of ours on video.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.940
It's not so much a secret if you tell him!

33:51.940 --> 33:52.940

33:52.940 --> 33:53.940
Sorry, we're not going to kill you.

33:53.940 --> 33:56.060
We're going to, um, feed you pie.

33:56.060 --> 33:58.180
Actually, I don't like pie.

33:58.180 --> 34:00.580
Or donuts with white frosting on them.

34:00.580 --> 34:05.940
Perhaps this song will fit Loki after tonight's staff meeting and it's our fortune cookie

34:05.940 --> 34:07.380
message of the day.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.380
Enjoy.

34:08.380 --> 34:20.380
Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave because I go berserk?

34:20.380 --> 34:29.380
Well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind.

34:29.380 --> 34:36.380
And they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha

34:36.380 --> 34:39.380
To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time

34:39.380 --> 34:43.380
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats

34:43.380 --> 34:46.380
And they're coming to take me away, ha ha

34:48.380 --> 34:51.380
You thought it was a joke and so you laughed, you laughed

34:51.380 --> 34:55.380
When I had said that losing you would make me flip my lip

34:55.380 --> 35:04.380
Right? You know you laughed, I heard you laugh, you laughed, you laughed and laughed, and then you left, but now you know I'm utterly mad.

35:04.380 --> 35:11.380
And, they're coming to take me away, haha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, haha!

35:11.380 --> 35:22.380
To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes and they're coming to take me away, haha!

35:22.380 --> 35:31.380
I cooked your food, I cleaned your house, and this is how you pay me back for all my kind, unselfish, loving deeds.

35:31.380 --> 35:40.380
Well, you just wait, they'll find you yet, and when they do, they'll put you in the ASPCA, you mangy mutt.

35:40.380 --> 35:47.380
And, they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha,

35:47.380 --> 35:51.440
To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time

35:51.440 --> 35:54.760
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their green white coats

35:54.760 --> 35:59.420
And they're coming to take me away to the happy home

35:59.420 --> 36:02.540
With trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket-weavers

36:02.540 --> 36:05.100
Who spit and smile and twiddle with bums and foes

36:05.100 --> 36:09.820
And they're coming to take me away to the funny farm

36:09.820 --> 36:12.040
Where life is beautiful all the time

36:12.040 --> 36:16.000
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their green white coats

36:16.000 --> 36:31.280
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.280
You know we love you.

36:32.280 --> 36:34.680
Stayin' up late, especially you crazy kids in the UK.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.840
Actually, I think you finally went to bed.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.280
But thank you guys still so much for listening.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.160
We appreciate you and we'll see you next week, alright?

36:42.160 --> 36:43.860
Our next live program is Tuesday night.

36:43.860 --> 36:48.260
Dark Soccer's Pump Up The Volume. Wednesday night there will be no live program because

36:48.260 --> 36:53.500
I will be in LA on a business trip. So you can try allgames.com instead because if I

36:53.500 --> 36:58.900
can I'm going to make a cameo over there. Otherwise you'll just have to listen to Jamie's

36:58.900 --> 37:04.140
show on Tuesday and our next live show on Sunday. Sound good? Alrighty. Have a great

37:04.140 --> 37:08.540
