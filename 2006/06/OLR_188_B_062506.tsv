487	19088	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19949	25733	Anyway, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 188 for this June the 25th of 2006.
27994	28514	We're here.
28554	30476	We're going to get back into the news very shortly here.
30536	38060	However, I wanted to grill our special guest in studio, 23rd Magus, here for just a minute here about something he had told me about on break.
38320	40482	You were talking about World of Warcraft, right?
41282	41462	Yes.
41682	44044	And you were talking about the add-ons for World of Warcraft.
44765	44985	Yes.
45345	50547	Now, there was one that I thought was very interesting that you said you had installed that messes with the chat somehow.
50867	51587	I've never heard of this.
51607	52268	This sounds great.
52288	54108	Yes, it's an add-on called Eloquence.
54748	55689	It's a chat filter.
55769	66652	I refer to it as a sanity filter for the grammar freaks out there who are tired of the noob speak, the dude speak, the lead speak, or just plain dumb speak.
68033	72414	Basically, it filters through whatever comes through your chat and
73084	73364	and so on.
102586	114324	and most of the add-ons for the WoW players you can go to ui.worldofwar.net or curse-gaming.com and pick up some add-ons to kind of enhance your play experience.
114424	116267	So this filter basically...
117306	118307	DarkSakura
138491	142634	Except for the times where you do it as a joke when it's funny.
143574	150939	Still, I love good grammar, and I like to see good grammar when I'm about in my MMOs.
151659	153621	Then you send me that for Ragnarok.
154141	155562	Beautiful thought.
157463	163307	I just wanted you to be able to share that with our listeners, because I didn't know about that, but I'm only a casual World of Warcraft player.
163347	164928	I'm not hardcore.
164948	166689	You are a casual's casual, Robyn.
167822	169263	A casual casual who has never even hit 60.
169303	170424	But you'll have more fun when you hit 60.
170544	170785	Alright.
171025	171365	Anyway.
171405	171725	Moving on.
191425	193085	Some news out of Nintendo this week.
193145	200307	Some power players over at Nintendo, namely Iwata and Miyamoto, have been discussing the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and more.
200327	203768	And there's a full in-depth article over on Gamasutra.com.
204088	206449	I thought maybe I'd pull some choice quotes out of here.
206789	208629	Iwata talked about the GameCube launch.
209049	215291	When we launched GameCube, the initial sales were good, and all the hardware was manufactured at the time we were sold through.
215871	226739	However, at this period, we could not provide the market with strong software titles in a timely fashion.
227139	232563	As a result, we could not leverage the initial launch time momentum, and sales of GameCube slowed down.
232963	244731	To avoid repeating this with Wii, we have been intensifying the software development, both internally at Nintendo and at developers outside the company, in order to prepare an aggressive software lineup for Wii and after the launch.
245191	252754	So it kind of sounds like they're learning from some of the mistakes they made with GameCube, which was namely, you know, kind of a dead period, which kind of happened with the DS, too, didn't it?
252794	264660	But, you know, I remember for a couple months after the DS came out, even on this show, because we were up and running by the time the DS was out, and I remember earlier episodes of this program, during that lull, we were kind of like, come on, Nintendo, where's our games?
265120	266260	Ping Pals ain't gonna cut it!
266360	266721	Come on!
267361	268401	And suddenly, boom!
268621	269102	Hit games.
269202	271182	Yeah, and then, like, just one hit game after another.
272003	273644	Miyamoto, I'm sure you guys want to know what he said.
273664	274544	Here's a quote from Miyamoto.
275211	281736	While I feel that we need more internal software development resources at Nintendo, we have not increased the number greatly.
282096	291703	When we combine the total number of people working for Nintendo's first party and second party titles, however, there are far more than 1,500 people working on the titles today.
292564	293384	Very interesting.
293965	301150	Some quotes there from the main men themselves that they're trying to learn from their mistakes with the GameCube and go forth with that.
301190	302551	So, I applaud Nintendo.
303462	305103	I just think it's good business sense.
305163	311265	That's what any business needs to progress is learn from their mistakes.
311465	316907	Yeah, and you can't just assume that the business is going to be there no matter what, and I will not...
328590	334337	Name any companies here who seem to be guilty of making that mistake recently, but it's four letters, starts with an S, ends with Oni.
336800	348473	Speaking of progressive thinking, the brand new MacBook, basically running off of some really crappy integrated graphics chip that
349735	351456	It's unable to run most games.
351817	352717	Well, fear not.
352837	356741	At least you can use it sort of like the Wii.
356841	362865	Using the accelerometer that's built into it, it's basically designed to detect if the computer is falling.
364927	390254	you know stop the hard drive so that doesn't you know ruin any of your data well a clever gamer has actually used this program called the AMS 2 HID which is used with this program Neverball to basically make the modern-day equivalent of a wooden labyrinth so by tilting your computer you can use it to control games
391308	394710	Crappy games, yes, but you can control games.
394850	397711	I knew you would not be able to get through that story without taking a swing.
398031	400132	I'm sorry, it can't run anything.
400312	402273	It says right in the article here.
402873	413578	It's using basically this integrated graphics chip that's designed by Apple, and it doesn't run anything because it's not ATI or NVIDIA compliant.
413618	415779	So, I'm sorry, StarCraft.
415959	416119	A.T.I.
416139	417580	Chip in this one.
439914	449462	I do think it's a silly idea, but, you know, whatever, some guy's bored and wants to do, you know, Labyrinth, whatever, but I don't really see it being the next trend in gaming.
450742	455666	This is more one of those, you know, isn't that funny stories to me.
457828	464433	I don't know, I mean, if you, it's just like, was it, like that stupid game that they had with, um,
465342	472025	Windows 98, that bumper car game thing that came with.
472165	473226	Yeah, that sucked too.
473826	479989	None of the games made by Microsoft or Apple that come with their systems.
480489	482530	Granted, they're not supposed to be that great.
482630	483571	Just, they all suck.
484231	487472	I mean, you can't really innovate on Solitaire.
488413	488753	I don't know.
490534	491434	Kiss my ass.
491474	492815	Chip's challenged with the shit.
494793	495574	Didn't come with it.
495634	496975	You had to buy it separately.
498056	498376	All right.
498416	502359	Anyway, we were talking about Wii-type technology there a little bit.
503140	504901	But what is really coming to the Wii?
504981	508624	Perhaps some new trademarks registered by Nintendo of Japan give some hints.
509365	512167	Wii Culture was something that was recently trademarked by them.
512567	518852	Wii Pointer, which kind of sounds like it might be the name of what we've been calling the Wii Mode or the Rev Mode.
519253	521034	What were you calling it, DarkSakura?
521054	522395	I've always been calling it the Wii Mode.
522796	523216	The Wii Con.
523236	523656	The Wii Con.
523676	524437	You were calling it the Wii Con.
525705	529948	Well, it sounds like the official name is probably going to be the Wii Pointer because I don't know what else that could be.
532110	542259	Also, they've registered Exclamation Point, Exclamation Point M. And you can actually look that up online if you want to see that trademark for yourself.
542739	543600	It seems like...
544421	552007	Exclamation, exclamation, M could be some type of instant messaging because that kind of looks like I am when you look at it.
552828	557091	However, we don't know anything 100% for sure until the system actually comes out.
558112	559413	So we shall see.
559493	562456	But we like to speculate based on what's going on behind the scenes.
562476	563657	It's the instant messenger.
565298	566259	Was that announced for sure?
566279	567380	No, I'm making that up.
569991	573213	and Nintendo Maniac 64 is pointing out that it's way upside down.
573733	574294	Yeah, right.
575054	576535	Yeah, we figured that one out.
576575	582779	Yeah, and that's a cutesy thing to do, which would make sense for Nintendo, but we'll find out.
583539	583839	Yeah.
586000	586541	Well, I don't know.
586601	590483	It could be, I guess, instant messaging, but who knows.
591351	600756	One thing, though, that Nintendo does have in store, at least, is the fact that their controller actually vibrates, and it is wireless, so that's one step ahead of Sony.
601377	611963	But, of course, Immersion says that they're wondering now if Nintendo copied them, and that there could possibly be a lawsuit against Nintendo.
613283	619667	We know for a fact, of course, Microsoft actually licenses the Immersion technology or whatever.
620953	621273	I don't know.
621313	625636	I can't believe that they're the first company to think of rumbling controllers.
627398	628458	But, I don't know.
628539	635384	They're basically going to keep a close eye on the Wii to see if the technology is the same and if they can make some money off of it.
635804	636284	So what is it?
636524	638045	We've got our eye on you.
638346	640007	We've got our eye on you.
640367	644730	We're the only one who can get to work, so obviously you copied us.
644930	648393	I mean, that's basically what it's, you know, backwards thinking.
648683	650064	I'm starting to wonder about these guys.
650144	651245	It's kind of interesting.
651605	652406	I don't like them.
652506	653667	Why?
654267	654928	Just because of this?
655648	656609	I just don't like immersion.
657290	657570	Why?
657690	659071	You've got to tell me why.
659631	660552	Why don't I like them?
660632	663674	Because they're basically trying to profit off of all this stuff.
664035	670880	Granted, they're trying to sue for... Why didn't they sue them back in the day when they had the Rumble Pack or something like that?
671220	675924	Why didn't they sue back when the original PlayStation came out?
676624	677505	Thank you for watching!
705746	709309	Bullymania has an interesting perspective on this in our chatroom.
709329	711471	When capitalism no longer works, you sue.
711491	712572	Interesting perspective.
736874	737094	Yeah.
741716	747619	Excuse me, I had a, uh, something caught in my throat.
747659	747959	Hairball?
748399	749020	Yeah, hairball.
750440	756683	You know, with as much hair as I managed to brush off the cat last night, I wouldn't be surprised.
757423	763046	Anyway, um, well, you know how Sony was saying, you know, the, uh,
763649	767393	PS3 as a computer, the PS3 as a computer, blah blah blah.
767493	768854	I remember a story about this.
768894	772077	Yeah, you brought this up a couple weeks ago, yeah, about the computer thing with the PS3.
772417	782727	Well, basically there was a, the UK Court of Appeals has said that the PlayStation 2 is not a computer.
784480	788324	They basically pretty much laughed at Sony.
788724	798453	Lord Justice C. Chadwick said that Sony's skeleton argument was, to quote, beyond what can be regarded as acceptable written advocacy.
800074	803897	So, Sony got pwned.
804438	805479	They got served.
806620	807080	Interesting.
807140	807881	So what does this mean?
808729	810930	Those tax breaks they were looking forward to may not happen.
811331	811811	Pretty much.
811911	817034	The UK Court of Appeals also denied Sony any right to bring the case to the European Court of Justice.
817174	829120	The other thing they should note is it doesn't matter anyways if the PS3 is considered a computer or not because those taxes on electronics are gone now.
830141	833623	So it wouldn't matter if it's categorized as a
834551	839013	Game console, has a PC, has a vibrator, it doesn't matter.
839093	842174	It's still going to be taxed for it.
844335	844615	I don't know.
844775	850957	I think any way to make more money, it seems like nowadays, it's just... I don't know.
851777	852618	Very desperate.
853058	854058	Very crazy.
854658	859360	Crazy like Kojima and his comparisons to steak.
860841	862681	Yes, what may I be talking about?
863122	864022	Well, actually...
865765	866045	PS3, PS4, PS5
889298	898821	And then, of course, for the 360, if they want a great steak dinner, a great steak with their family, a little bit more casual during the weekends, they might select the 360.
899721	903162	I don't understand how these comparisons of steak work, but whatever.
903202	909724	And then, of course, then to the Wii, why not have a great steak at your house every day, and then you might choose the Wii.
912564	913485	Does that make any sense to you?
913625	914745	Because it doesn't make any sense to me.
915877	925062	You know, usually it's the eccentric people that are making these comparisons to food and other things that, I don't know, it's a very strange comparison to be making.
925302	926343	Then he was talking about movies.
926643	936748	PlayStation 3 is like a movie theater for people who want to see this movie on a big screen with THX and 5.1 audio, even if they have to pay a high price.
937348	937709	Whereas the 360...
938951	940272	The 360 is like a DVD.
940352	946775	Basically, you don't know what movie you want to see, so you go to the store and see if you can pick up a good one.
948056	949356	Which I don't understand.
949496	953398	Then the Wii is like a TV for when you're at home.
953759	958421	You don't know what you want to watch, but you want to have that variety.
959221	967506	Well, one of the best people I got to meet at E3, Igarashi Koji, is actually...
968683	981234	I made some comments about the Playstation 3 at E3 and he's quoted as saying maybe it's too expensive but he did actually have an interview with Game Informer
982219	991984	Talking about Microsoft, he said he wasn't really negative about Microsoft, but to quote, for some reason they tend to back off a little when it comes to something really foreign.
992705	1000549	But if Japanese developers would say they're working on Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest or Metal Gear maybe, then I guess Japanese consumers would take it seriously and consider purchasing it.
1001649	1019322	He's also stated that as far as the New Castlevania game is going for Portrait of Ruin, the next installment after Dawn of Sorrow, it might feature unlockable co-op missions to be played over Wi-Fi, but that's not confirmed.
1019422	1022385	Actually, he's quoted as saying it's not confirmed because he hasn't started working on it.
1023225	1026968	So he's thinking that it would be something unlockable.
1027950	1050342	It was also mentioned that basically there's going to be the two-screen display for Portrait of Ruin, again for the DS, different collectible items in there, but it's not stated whether or not it's going to be skills and items rather than souls.
1051063	1056726	So that's what I had to say, but there was the potential about...
1058292	1060814	and possibly working on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
1060854	1061855	I'll still come up in that interview.
1062556	1066159	I'm sure many folks would be very much looking forward to a Castlevania on the PlayStation 3.
1066519	1068180	I just loved his reaction.
1068521	1068781	Yeah.
1070342	1071803	Perhaps it's a bit too expensive.
1073425	1076527	Anyway, another game that people are really looking forward to is Super Smash Bros.
1076627	1077088	Brawl.
1077448	1079109	And there's a new rumor floating around.
1079169	1080851	It started at GoNintendo.com.
1081741	1086104	The Ubisoft is going to be getting into the game there with some of their characters.
1086165	1103678	And if you think about what that would bring to the table, that could be Jade from Beyond Good and Evil, Rayman, Sam Fisher, which would be an interesting counterpart to Solid Snake if you think about it, and the Prince from Prince of Persia, which I think probably from that list, Rayman and the Prince would seem most likely, especially Rayman.
1103698	1104759	That would be an interesting addition.
1104779	1105519	Yeah, I could see that.
1105980	1106220	Yeah.
1107552	1114873	So that was developer Mashihiro Sakurai saying that other third-party characters would be a definite possibility.
1115213	1120634	And GoNintendo.com, I suppose, is speculating that Ubisoft is possibly the other third party being involved there.
1120654	1122815	You know what would be cool, though, if they did it?
1123355	1127836	Since they're releasing Rayman's Raving Rabbits, have the rabbits as one of the characters.
1127856	1128696	You just want to kill bunnies.
1129456	1130696	I just think they're funny.
1131576	1132516	You just want to murder bunnies.
1132796	1133397	I know how you are.
1133717	1134977	Cute animals need to die.
1135377	1135617	All right.
1136330	1139772	And of course, every time we bring up Super Smash Bros.
1139812	1144355	Brawl, folks in the chatroom start talking about what characters they want to see in it.
1144935	1146656	Yuri Lever talking about Katamari.
1148117	1149658	That would be an interesting third-party thing.
1149778	1154981	Well, the only thing about that is they've said that it hasn't been on the system already, so probably not.
1155321	1161665	PooEater says the Jet Set guy, he could spray your face, but again, also not on any Nintendo system.
1162105	1163086	I still say Sonica.
1163823	1166844	I think Sonic and Bonk are actually the ones I'm thinking.
1167044	1173507	Oh, that's a good point, especially with the recent Genesis and TurboGrafx love, thanks to the virtual console.
1173527	1174467	That's a brilliant idea.
1174987	1175588	I hope it happens.
1176388	1179029	Alright, anyway, DarkSakura.
1179989	1180349	Yeah!
1180529	1182030	We get letters once in a while, right?
1182150	1182510	Oh, really?
1182770	1185371	Yes, they send them to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1185892	1187252	Real quick last thought, sorry.
1187732	1188533	Nestor and Howard.
1188553	1189233	Yes!
1190438	1192599	That's a little too old school for most people, I think.
1193019	1196821	I remember Nestor and Howard.
1197161	1200302	Especially the Mega Man one that went on for like three issues.
1200342	1201062	That one was great.
1201323	1203043	Do we ever get emails about Nestor and Howard?
1203483	1203744	No.
1203884	1204364	We should.
1204384	1206465	People should email us their favorite memories.
1206845	1211227	Well, DarkSakura, tell us about what they're emailing us about at MailbagAtOrangeLawnTrader.com this week.
1218815	1220956	Our listeners are very emo.
1222056	1223736	Okay, I'm going to start from the beginning.
1223816	1227057	I got one from DJ Ratchet, who's been on our boards for quite a while.
1228297	1229317	Just to go ahead and read this.
1229537	1232698	I've been behind on your podcast and I've been listening to a few of the slightly older episodes.
1232798	1235599	I have a few responses to some of the things said.
1236099	1239359	Number one, congrats on Loki for getting married, even though everyone said it a hundred times.
1240800	1242580	It's not just OLR with the Sony hate.
1242600	1246201	Pretty much every other podcast I've listened to has nothing but bad things to say about Sony.
1246821	1248323	At least you guys are trying to be fair.
1248503	1250946	Others are being real fanboyish about the whole thing.
1251347	1253389	I'm one of the suckers who are going to get a PS3 though.
1254310	1255632	I'm trying, guys.
1255752	1258936	I'm really trying to be devil's advocate when it comes to Sony, but...
1259502	1260282	Guys, it's tough.
1260502	1264144	And even the Sony fanboys have to recognize right now the odds are not in your favor.
1264284	1264744	I'm sorry.
1264904	1267525	The system is only as good as the games on it.
1267786	1270087	E3 was not a good setup for Sony fanboys.
1270187	1270607	I'm sorry.
1270687	1272347	We'll do what we can the rest of the year.
1272428	1276809	Maybe Sony will throw us a few frickin' bones before Christmas, or the launch of the system, really.
1277430	1278770	They had cool commercials, though.
1279531	1281251	Yeah, I guess there's something.
1282312	1284012	If they get Castlevania, that's a huge plus.
1284193	1285073	To return to the email.
1285986	1288568	Harmonix does need to make another Amplitude frequency game.
1288648	1290009	I'm still hooked to those games.
1290049	1292750	Guitar Hero looks like Amplitude with a guitar peripheral and nothing else.
1293131	1294932	That's the reason I have not bought Guitar Hero.
1295452	1296052	Quick question.
1296113	1299655	Is Space Channel 5 Special Edition for the PS2 a straight port of the Dreamcast version?
1300095	1301336	I'm considering buying it.
1302096	1305538	To answer the question, actually it's both.
1305678	1307880	It's Space Channel 5 2 and the Dreamcast 1.
1308640	1309221	I own it.
1309341	1312523	I have not played it yet because I have the Japanese Space Channel 5 2.
1313561	1316302	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1337217	1344140	Actually, another thing that he wanted to add is that his mother, who knows nothing about video games, thinks that the Blu-ray is the biggest ripoff in the world.
1345860	1348942	Well, the players are like, I don't know, $700 or something, right?
1349162	1350562	Oh, that was something I saw this week.
1350602	1355084	I saw an HD DVD player in action at Best Buy or something.
1355644	1357485	And you know what?
1358044	1360265	Not ready to drop $1,000 on it, that's for sure.
1360285	1360265	$600?
1360305	1361625	I don't know.
1362565	1373628	Honestly, $360 if they're going to release that, they're going to have to do it like $200 at most for that player for me to be interested in it because the picture quality is not that much better.
1374208	1381730	And if Blu-ray is only supposed to look that good, I am not impressed with the technology at this time.
1381790	1386011	I just don't think there's going to be... It's not that huge of an improvement over...
1390202	1392663	We have another email from Mark from Australia.
1396004	1397105	It's a very interesting email.
1397125	1399806	Go ahead and read this out loud.
1401206	1406928	I've just finished listening to episode 187 and once again I hear you guys defending violent content in video games.
1407408	1412190	It seems to be a topic that is forever raising its ugly head in almost every single show.
1413030	1418613	Now, although I'm a gamer and particularly love violent content in the games I play, I find your arguments always seem to be one-sided.
1418994	1425397	I've never heard anyone from Orange Lounge Radio seriously and intelligently consider whether it's bad for kids, or more so, if it's bad for adults.
1425477	1427659	Seriously, can simulated killing really be good for your head?
1428559	1431723	Loki asks the question, what's worse, simulated killing or killing a deer?
1432244	1438832	I'm sure Loki has no idea about the answer to this question, but proceeds to speak in a high-pitched voice mimicking the mothers of the affected kids.
1439133	1441496	His only objective is to try to offend them.
1441876	1444499	If he calmed down and put some thought into his answers, he might seem credible.
1447516	1459403	I actually responded to him and in my email I said that the viewpoint we've been coming from is more on the rebuttal standpoint where we're given a limited scope of what to defend.
1459543	1466468	Basically, we have all these people and I honestly think that the ones that are saying, you know, ban it, ban it, ban it, are...
1467348	1471651	Very one-sided, very, you know, not willing to put a lot of thought into it.
1471711	1472632	No, I fully agree.
1472912	1474553	And I've actually said this in the past.
1474633	1475353	I said it today.
1475894	1482018	You know, there is a certain age where you have to be careful with what you expose your children to.
1482958	1494626	But any, I should say, mature adult, any person who's above a certain age and has a certain ability to tell reality from...
1496225	1512350	Fantasy would be able to intelligently know the difference between picking up your controller and killing a bunch of pixels or 3D rendered models than taking an Uzi and blowing away your school.
1513130	1518572	I think that an intelligent, sane human being would be able to tell the difference.
1520253	1521393	I absolutely agree with that.
1521533	1524854	I think the listener who wrote us an email said,
1525567	1526168	Thanks for watching!
1547443	1550484	To play this game that I'm going to buy for them with my money.
1551305	1553786	And certainly there are some games that some children should not be playing.
1554186	1556747	But that's really up to the parent to make the decision there.
1557548	1558908	And that's kind of just my thoughts on it.
1559369	1561910	Loki, do you have anything you want to say about the mom impressions or whatever?
1562659	1563619	Thank you for watching!
1587153	1589214	That's pretty, any idiot can tell you that.
1589354	1594356	I mean, if I kill, you know, a virtual hooker, I guess, it's not a real person.
1595176	1596176	They don't have feelings.
1596517	1601498	Their family's not going to worry about, you know, they're not going to be all upset if I kill her.
1601599	1603579	She just respawns later and I go kill her again.
1603899	1604400	It doesn't matter.
1604880	1609461	Whereas, you know, if I go kill, you know, my next door neighbor, that's a little different.
1609522	1611002	More people are impacted by that.
1611502	1615924	So how can you say that I'm wrong in saying that killing a virtual person is
1617108	1620336	No where near to the effect of killing something real.
1620537	1622942	Even if it's not a human person, say you kill
1623942	1625162	You know, an animal or something.
1625243	1629504	You know, kids are brought up knowing that animals are cute and stuff.
1629524	1643169	And if you take them out into the wilderness without obviously educating them and stuff, and you go and blow away Bambi, I mean, that's going to be a little, you know, that's going to probably shock them more than saying, killing virtual, you know, prostitute Betty.
1643229	1643649	I don't know.
1644150	1653233	And also, you know, speaking of that, you know, what's worse, going out and killing a deer for the sport of it or killing a deer because you're hungry and you need food?
1654164	1658725	You know, that there's, I think everything is situational, okay?
1658905	1665127	Or what about, say someone has broken into your house and has a gun at your head, I'm going to shoot them, okay?
1665727	1669008	I don't care, I will do what it takes to defend my house.
1669728	1674829	If they are in my property, and they're threatening to kill me, hell yeah, I would strike out at them.
1675289	1678030	It seems to be going a little into the what ifs.
1703186	1705127	Firebomber was pointing out that I'm at Ted Nugent's level.
1726459	1727419	I killed deers in Deer Hunter 3
1746861	1747801	Thanks for the email.
1747841	1751162	We like thought-provoking, intelligently written emails.
1752042	1757184	In a year, I'm planning on having a sproutlet.
1758184	1759024	I'm planning on breeding.
1759044	1759504	A spawn.
1759524	1760425	A spawn of Jamie.
1763279	1770865	But, you know, I'm not going to have my little kid going out and playing Halo when he's three or four.
1771565	1785935	But, you know, when I'm sure that my kid understands the difference between reality and fantasy, then I wouldn't mind if they're in there watching me play Halo as long as they understand the difference.
1786336	1789238	If they start reenacting it, they get their butt popped and I tell them no.
1790083	1790604	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1814804	1819747	It is your responsibility to make sure that they learn how to be a proper adult.
1820227	1822068	Childhood is what prepares you for being a grown-up.
1823609	1824309	Alright.
1824469	1826450	I think you might get more letters from this one.
1826630	1827491	I want more letters!
1827671	1829452	As long as they're intelligently written, that's all we ask.
1829512	1830712	Yeah, and have good grammar.
1831373	1835295	I got an email from Cameron.
1836700	1839663	saying, hey, I was wondering your thoughts on Banjo-Kazooie for DS.
1840143	1847930	Rare is already porting Diddy Kong Racing from the 64 DS and EGM rumored that a Banjo-Kazooie game was also coming to DS as a port or new.
1848430	1849951	I want to know if you think it will happen.
1850051	1853014	Also, do you think any Banjo-Kazooie games will make it to live arcade?
1853094	1854235	Thank you, thank you for the show.
1854735	1856717	First of all, I won't make it to live arcade because...
1858214	1861195	I don't know, does Nintendo still have part of the rights on that?
1861735	1864896	I don't know, when it comes to Banjo-Kazooie, who technically owns that?
1864976	1865836	Rare or Nintendo?
1866056	1875058	Rare has it, then definitely, I don't think you'd see it on DS at all for that reason, but Xbox Live Arcade, definite possibility, but not for a long time.
1875218	1881539	I honestly didn't like the Banjo-Kazooie series, so I haven't... Yeah, I gotta be honest, it wasn't really a series of games I played a whole lot of.
1882359	1884860	Magus, you seem to be a little more up on the know on that, do you have any thoughts?
1886375	1889938	Uh, no, I haven't played Banjo-Kazooie since it came out.
1890799	1893902	Well, this listener's going to be very disappointed in our feedback on that one.
1894102	1894562	Sorry.
1896664	1900468	You know, if it's rare, though, I think rare Microsoft's really where they're headed.
1900488	1900808	I wouldn't...
1902242	1902362	D.S.
1902382	1902662	Diddy Kong
1935842	1938246	Wow, I need more time to think about that.
1938667	1941091	Worst experience at a video game store?
1942574	1944878	I have to say it was EB before the games got merged.
1946015	1949476	There were some really not knowledgeable people at a couple of the EVs I've been to.
1950137	1952918	I've never had a problem at a GameStop, but then again, they all know me.
1953838	1955459	Yeah, you're kind of lucky in that regard.
1956499	1961661	You know, I would say, more recently, this is kind of a weak answer, but I didn't have a lot of time to think about this one.
1962601	1970864	Walking into a gaming store time and time again, not being able to locate an Xbox 360 for many months, and kind of being laughed at when asking about it.
1971304	1973165	It's like, you know, come on, guys.
1974096	1974396	DarkSakura.com
1998513	2000453	Out of the... No, Julie was with me.
2000473	2001194	Yeah, I don't recall it.
2001434	2008355	Julie was with me because we were picking up one before some convention and no one was coming.
2008375	2012316	We asked people, oh, I don't know, I don't have a key, and they weren't finding anyone, but that was Walmart.
2012936	2013937	Loki, do you have any stories?
2013997	2014717	Or Magus, anybody?
2016777	2022639	I would say... There was one time I was buying that memory card thing, kind of like a...
2025764	2029152	Where you can rip memory card saves off of like a Playstation card
2029926	2032107	Yeah, like a dextro, but not as a third-party thing.
2032947	2036949	And... The guy was acting stupid.
2036969	2038249	I don't remember what he was doing.
2038269	2039790	He was acting really retarded.
2039970	2042791	But then there was another time I was trying to buy a PSP at launch.
2043111	2044972	He's like, good luck finding one!
2045052	2045712	Ha ha ha!
2045912	2047613	It went to Best Buy, and there was like a ton of them sitting there.
2048033	2050094	So, yeah.
2050434	2055516	But I remember, like I said last week, I overheard in one of the GameStops that they don't even...
2056189	2061494	inform their employees on what games are coming out and what the games are.
2061614	2064517	They basically are told to read the Game Informer magazine.
2065618	2067019	Which, that's stupid.
2069121	2069962	Eh, whatever.
2071723	2072004	Magus?
2072644	2073925	Mine's more of a general thing.
2074486	2079531	Just, okay, tip to GameStop, EB Games, whatever.
2081012	2081733	Your employees...
2082779	2083721	are selling games.
2084201	2087386	They should know something about the games they're selling.
2087847	2093836	If you have a person that's completely clueless, you don't employ them or you have them learn first, right?
2094646	2104632	From what I understand from GameStop employees I've talked to, at least that chain, GameStop, has a policy where they can get magazines for free to read up on what's going on.
2105032	2107834	How many employees take advantage of that or whether they're encouraged to, I don't know.
2107854	2108534	I haven't worked there.
2109015	2111416	But I do know at least they have that policy, which is interesting.
2112156	2123563	I'm probably going to have to second the issue with employees mocking customers who didn't pre-order their product and then are surprised that it's not in stock.
2123928	2129120	Yeah, we know we can't always pre-order things, but you don't have to get in our face for it.
2130202	2131786	Honestly, I think that
2133689	2137911	If you know something's going to be hard to get and you want to make sure you have your copy, freaking pre-order it.
2138531	2144893	It's $5 out of your pocket, and if it turns out it's something that you don't want, you can move it to something else.
2145393	2146614	It's not hard.
2146674	2147134	I don't agree.
2147294	2153196	I don't pre-order games, and I don't like that kind of commitment, and I feel like it's almost like I don't want to commit that I'm going to buy.
2153676	2154096	I don't care.
2154116	2155417	You're not committing that you're buying it.
2155457	2155957	It's $60.
2156097	2158018	You're not committing... $60, that's a hell of a commitment.
2158038	2158278	You're not...
2159338	2160638	For a game, it's $5.
2160838	2161739	For a game, it's $5.
2162359	2163679	What about a game system?
2163759	2164959	Games are easy to come by.
2164979	2168580	And if you don't want it, you can get your money back.
2170820	2172621	It's not that hard.
2172661	2175581	I feel like those stores try to force me into it.
2176041	2176482	It's the whole thing.
2176682	2179062	I don't like being told I have to do something.
2179122	2179522	Nobody does.
2179842	2183623	Hey, I pre-ordered my Xbox 360 system about...
2185463	2189609	And do you think that they're responsible for Microsoft's error?
2189629	2195496	They did take the number of pre-orders that they thought they were getting systems and then Microsoft screwed them over.
2198922	2199763	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2220180	2222983	I'm sorry, that's called stupid customer That's called the customer is a lazy ass
2239918	2243063	No, it's up to the retailer to inform their customers.
2243404	2245347	Inform them exactly the source.
2245367	2247410	Hey, they had shortages before with the PlayStation 2.
2247750	2251316	If they knew that this was going to be a typical problem, they could say, you know what...
2255290	2259813	How is what one company do illustrate what another company is going to do?
2260594	2261154	Please answer that.
2261234	2268339	Tell me exactly how is the behavior of a completely different entity going to explain how another completely different entity is going to perform.
2268359	2271601	The companies operate in a similar fashion as far as hardware launches.
2271641	2272221	I don't think so.
2272301	2277264	Actually, Microsoft doesn't have to deal with having their orders come from basically a foreign source.
2278085	2281087	Microsoft is all located this side of the country.
2281567	2284069	Anything that Sony does has to have approval from Sony of Japan.
2284835	2289896	Actually, Microsoft Systems, I believe, were being manufactured in foreign countries.
2290137	2291497	It doesn't matter where it's manufactured.
2291557	2293257	It matters where the business decisions are being made.
2293978	2296058	Anyway, to go on to the next email.
2297479	2300119	We also have one from Ricky.
2300960	2305781	It says, one of our 15-year-old listeners...
2306607	2309929	says he's been listening to our show for the past two years and he's quite impressed.
2310090	2311531	Let's get to the point is what it says.
2312131	2321017	Anyway, I was browsing around on the net and I stumbled across a gif which happened to be someone's avatar for a certain forum from the image of this year's E3.
2321257	2322638	It was Ken Kutaragi.
2323519	2324680	Actually, he did spell it right.
2324720	2325320	Kudos to you.
2325861	2330044	Mouthing his mouth to the phrase Ridge Racer and it kept playing the words back and forth.
2331745	2333946	He recognized a face in this
2338231	2342513	It says that none other... It actually said it was Rob in this GIF.
2343273	2344494	Yeah, I've actually... You know what?
2344534	2350656	Somebody posted something similar in our forums that supposedly there's some reaction shot of me at some press conference.
2350957	2351617	Here's the thing, guys.
2351657	2352217	It's not me.
2352397	2353918	At least the picture I saw wasn't me.
2354058	2356379	I guess... I didn't even think the guy looked like me, but...
2359506	2373043	I tried going into the mailbag and looking at it and there was no GIF image attached so I would ask that listener to try resending it but just so you know when the Sony press conference was going on we were not there we were not at any of the big three press conferences I wish we were that popular amongst them
2373423	2379489	But unfortunately, not all those companies have embraced podcasting yet, with the exception of Microsoft.
2379509	2391319	But of course, you know, Major Nelson works for them, so that's the podcast that's definitely going to be... Actually, I would say Microsoft a little more than the others, you know, even because I know some other friendly podcasts we know of went to that conference, so that's cool.
2392500	2396044	But anyway, regardless, during the Sony Prep Conference, we were actually at the...
2398442	2406765	Arena Lounge in Santa Monica watching it on the big screen TV on a live feed and nobody was taking pictures of our reaction shots.
2407245	2413447	And really, I didn't have a problem with Sony's conference until the very end, to be honest.
2413735	2416736	And then kind of sitting back and reflecting on it, it just kind of got worse.
2417076	2420477	So I really don't think that picture's me because I don't know where it came from.
2420497	2422357	It's like eating bad McDonald's.
2422517	2425418	It was bad to begin with and then it just kind of festers in your stomach.
2425938	2432640	And also, I spent most of E3 hanging out with either Loki, DarkSakura, or Bobby from All Games.
2432680	2436921	So if you don't see them in the picture either, it's probably not me.
2437301	2437561	Sorry.
2438121	2440542	Also, we got an email and I'm using this as an example.
2441661	2444563	Someone sent us an email that consists of only, Hi.
2446484	2448765	Don't send me emails that just say, Hi.
2449326	2455450	Because what I'm going to do in the future when I see emails like this is I'm going to delete it and keep a list of your name.
2457091	2459052	Well, hi back, I guess.
2459192	2463034	I appreciate you taking the time to send such a thoughtful and well-written email.
2464135	2465976	I'm not mentioning the person's name on.
2466336	2467877	They also didn't put a subject in there.
2467917	2468878	All they wrote was, Hi.
2471826	2473990	You know now we're going to get like 30 emails this week.
2474030	2475112	Just say hi, hi, hi.
2475674	2478359	And what I will do is on our form, I will post their email address.
2479260	2480082	All right.
2480503	2483569	So that we can sign them up for some porn filters.
2485464	2490930	I think you really need it by posting them to the forum and probably just do that automatically with all those bots out there.
2491190	2492091	Yeah, there is that.
2492591	2494393	Any other emails besides the hi mail?
2494714	2497416	Just the ones that worship me as their goddess.
2497576	2499158	Those I usually just send to my personal email.
2499438	2501420	Oh yeah, all one of those emails.
2501460	2502001	Hey!
2502241	2507166	You can shut the hell up right now.
2507266	2508688	Meg has got a total zing there.
2509362	2510382	You sent yourself.
2510502	2511303	That is bull.
2511583	2512443	My husband sent them.
2512503	2515264	DMM, I need some ATH points for Magus.
2515304	2516484	A good five points for him, please.
2516624	2517084	You know what?
2517124	2523326	You need to... I think he's upgraded from toilet paper to a cardboard box for his joke book.
2524126	2524406	All right.
2524446	2525847	Anyway, we've got to keep it moving here.
2526287	2529848	Again, if you have emails, mail back at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2530968	2535669	During the break here, live only, we were talking about some gaming pieces that were in the media recently.
2536349	2538390	One piece we were saving here for Part B was
2539208	2539850	Nightline.
2542314	2548484	Basically what happened is that Nightline recently did this story here talking about
2549144	2557367	The Pentagon, and how kind of dumb they looked when they mistook a bit of Mashima for a terrorist training tool and showed it to the House Intelligence Committee.
2558628	2572914	Tapper basically said this, terrorists twisting an American video game into a jihadist training tool, and then proceeds to lay out how the whole thing happened, including getting an anonymous interview with a European gamer who created the now infamous terrorist battlefield clip.
2574207	2577490	The Pentagon is still claiming that the Moshima is being used by terrorists.
2578450	2583834	Tapper is calling bullshit on this excuse and tells the Pentagon so, basically.
2584214	2590498	And there's a quote here, We should really be questioning the kind of advice that Congress is getting.
2590879	2596683	And that comes from Georgia Tech Ian Boggist, who's in the piece.
2596783	2601526	It was a parody of Team America World Police.
2603114	2604135	That's what the Machimo is.
2605256	2606317	That's very interesting.
2607517	2608358	So, I don't know.
2608958	2610079	That was interesting, you know.
2611480	2612481	Stupid intelligence.
2612601	2627852	But, um, kind of unrelated to that whole thing, the Frag Dolls and the PMS Clan, they're boycotting the World Series of Video Gaming Girl Love, I guess, contest or whatever.
2627872	2631474	They're doing some pageant contest that has to do with the World Series of Video Games.
2631815	2632135	The Miss...
2633212	2634874	WSVG Contest
2651503	2653245	PMS Amber Dalton Courier Journal
2672754	2684202	and basically, I don't know, one of the funny things I keep seeing back is the, like for example, the World Series of Video Gaming they shot back with.
2684482	2692988	The Frag Dolls and PMS Clan have stated that they plan to run the Mr. WSVG competition in the Taurus Next Stop in Dallas.
2693568	2702414	If this happens, in order to be fair, the World Series of Video Gaming may feel compelled to run another beauty contest as well.
2702754	2708980	and then of course other gamers who have been reading this are saying, well, those two clans suck anyways as far as gaming goes.
2709000	2711322	They don't even compete on a professional level.
2712924	2714245	So I thought that was funny.
2715106	2724795	I don't really know enough about those clans to pass judgment on it, so I'm just going to refrain from commenting, although I would love to have a representative on the program at some point to kind of give their perspective.
2726382	2739331	I know that they've been giving a lot of shit online about how many I think the PMS clan specifically they have their gamer cards linked on Xbox.com and I think like most of them have under 1k points except one girl's got a ton
2739687	2742589	But then they say, well that's because we're playing Halo 2 and you don't get points for that.
2742609	2757037	Yeah, they have Halo 2, but the other thing I thought was funny was... And with all respect to them, because again, I don't know them, it does seem interesting though, they are linked from Xbox.com, wouldn't you, knowing that, want to buff up the 360 games?
2757277	2758577	I don't know.
2758697	2766282	I know they play Halo 2 a lot, granted, and one of the funny things I was reading is that they're actually coming out with...
2767831	2771694	Their casual gaming portion of the clan.
2772114	2774336	So there's going to be some experts at Uno or something.
2774356	2774976	I don't know.
2775416	2778038	But I'm all for a casual game.
2778058	2778939	You don't have to be hardcore all the time.
2778959	2779839	I just thought that was funny though.
2780480	2782801	Are you going to be entering the Hotman competition, Loki?
2783001	2783742	I think you should be in it.
2784986	2785627	I think it would be funny.
2785647	2787708	Because you know they're going to get all these male models.
2787948	2788849	Well, here's the problem, though.
2788909	2790030	I think Loki should be up there.
2790050	2790831	Here's the problem, though.
2791191	2791932	It's in Dallas.
2792312	2795515	And it's also... They're a ways away.
2795855	2796435	Chat room?
2796635	2799998	I think we should have someone go in there in an asbestos suit and set themselves on fire.
2800619	2801119	Chat room?
2801880	2805583	Who would like to contribute to a Send Loki to Dallas fund?
2805603	2808225	You'd win, Loki.
2809206	2813129	Our other sales branch is in Dallas.
2814530	2814670	So...
2815727	2816128	Well, there you go.
2816148	2817068	You need to take a work trip.
2818889	2823392	You know, the whole argument with the fact that they don't have a lot of game points doesn't really count with me.
2824353	2829056	Because, I mean, if you're playing a lot of multiplayer games and stuff, not a lot of points may be coming from that.
2829076	2844707	Especially if you're not playing, like, you know, which, although, although, the PMS clan, I think it was the PMS clan, I can't remember which one's sponsored by Ubisoft, they have, they better be, you know, have a high achievement.
2845203	2847124	I have nothing against female clans.
2847144	2848925	Especially if they're competing out there, great.
2848945	2849065	Just
2872418	2872658	Great.
2872878	2876442	I mean, just don't, you know, make it sound like you're the best people in the world.
2877282	2879464	We need to have, like, the O.L.
2879544	2880866	Army as a gaming clan.
2881186	2881746	I thought about that.
2882467	2883028	Except they suck.
2884028	2885810	We have a lot of girls that listen to this show.
2886130	2887171	For just various games.
2887311	2894718	That aren't your supermodel girl types that Microsoft would want to flaunt about at their booth or whatever.
2894738	2895599	And that's just fine by me.
2895979	2896840	I like my girls normal.
2897889	2901090	Not that I date girls, but I like socializing with normal girls.
2903950	2906051	I say we form a clan and all that stuff.
2906211	2906631	Let's do it.
2906671	2907371	Send some emails.
2907651	2912292	If you're interested, send emails to mailbag at orangezonesradio.com It's not just women.
2912332	2914592	We can have a clan on Chromehounds.
2914672	2917853	We're going to be the multi-game clan.
2918413	2919093	The OL Army.
2919233	2921753	They're going to have actual clans in Chromehounds.
2923434	2924414	You can have the OL Army.
2925296	2926696	All right, anyway, let's move on here.
2926736	2928737	We got to get to the story about the PSP.
2946304	2948566	into PSP friendly formats.
2949226	2952129	By the way, you can also convert it for iPod or Trio.
2953030	2961397	It's only going to cost $25 for that functionality, which, by the way, you can find utilities on the internet to do it for free, but okay, whatever.
2961437	2967403	It's going to be a legal and blessed thing from TiVo, so it's kind of interesting because now the PSP can kind of have that
2967984	2970465	Hey, put your TiVo programs here on your PSP.
2970825	2978668	That might be something to sell the PSP and certainly make it more competitive with the iPod, even though, I don't know, iPod and PSP are so different anyway.
2978708	2984750	But for some people, when it's one or the other, that might be something that kind of, you know, makes the PSP look a little more alluring too.
2985210	2997215	I think it's just that they're going to be planning on doing this anyways with the whole PS3 and their, you know, was it their wireless streaming system that they've got there?
2997694	3001876	Johnny Depp is doing his, uh, lending his voice talent to the game for Captain Jack Sparrow.
3001896	3001936	Oh.
3001956	3001996	Um.
3026289	3028210	Yeah, that game I thought was pretty cool.
3028370	3030732	You know, it had all kinds of little hidden stuff thrown in it.
3030812	3036856	You know, what I did notice, you know, remember though that they didn't have a dude in it.
3040638	3042139	Why is the name suddenly escaping me?
3042219	3042759	Exactly.
3042779	3043400	Johnny Depp, thank you.
3043560	3044020	No, no.
3044220	3044781	Orlando Bloom?
3044901	3045741	Orlando Bloom, thank you.
3047282	3047783	He isn't.
3047823	3051545	They actually got a voice, a similar voice to it.
3052406	3053646	But there's a...
3055726	3065974	Quote on here from Johnny Depp said, Doing voiceovers is a great fun and a lot easier than stumbling about pretending to be Keith Richards or having scissors glued to your fingers all day.
3067015	3067835	He did not add.
3069256	3074400	You know, all things considered, the game looked decent.
3074420	3075521	That wasn't a quote, by the way.
3075581	3075841	I know.
3075921	3076762	It looked...
3078416	3082838	Your typical movie to game translation, but they didn't fuck it up.
3082958	3085598	And the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory games, they didn't fuck it up.
3085958	3086879	It looked pretty solid.
3087439	3090720	I think the Johnny Depp quotient is going to sell a lot more of this title.
3090760	3093761	I think it was a smart clinching there to get the game on board.
3094081	3098022	This announcement here is from Eurogamer, so I love the jokes they're putting in here.
3098582	3101143	For example, they said, why are pirates called pirates?
3101243	3102183	Because they are.
3104204	3104924	Oh my god.
3104944	3105904	That's so bad.
3106705	3107125	Wow.
3107952	3109212	That's fantastic.
3109232	3110073	That was bad.
3128917	3133219	Anyways, as far as Xbox Live, there's going to be some demos coming soon.
3133579	3142802	The first one, of course, which should have come out by now but hasn't, Prey, is supposed to be hitting Xbox Live Arcade, or Xbox Live's Marketplace, pretty soon.
3143443	3151146	If you can't wait, though, and you have a decent enough PC, you can actually download the PC demo for free on a lot of the major gaming sites, so definitely check that out.
3151886	3153947	The other demo is also slated for August 1st,
3154747	3155267	DarkSakura.com
3182395	3185756	All over and tries to find the website that you need to be looking at this week.
3186156	3188756	So DarkSakura, where should kids be pointing their browsers this week?
3191277	3198278	This is a site that I spend quite a bit of time on and it's not actually just because I also moderate there.
3199479	3200919	It's Gorilla Zone Official.
3202539	3208680	I was a big fan of this site before I was asked on as one of the moderators there.
3209441	3210801	Basically, this site
3211866	3216368	I have to say, 2J, he's so amazing with how quickly he gets the updates up.
3216968	3221089	Any new information that he has up on there, they're linked through LiveJournal.
3221990	3228032	If you add Gorillas News to your LiveJournal feed, it goes directly off GorillasUnofficial.com.
3228072	3229913	It's actually Gorillas-Unofficial.com.
3230293	3232613	The forums there are great, well-maintained.
3233034	3235535	Again, not just because I'm also working there, too.
3235935	3238736	But everybody there is just really terrific.
3240322	3249665	They're not just that, but if you go into the site, actually on the splash page there's new art features by people in the fan art community.
3252944	3254445	You'll see something different every time.
3254905	3262371	On top of that, this has probably, I'd say, one of the most complete lyrics, image, discography, everything.
3262911	3273899	And there's even a translation on here by my friend Haruna, who translated what Noodle said on the Apex tapes back when she was only speaking Japanese.
3274520	3275681	So check it out.
3275961	3276662	Very cool site.
3276902	3278503	I've been impressed with them from day one.
3279284	3280305	But what if I don't like gorillas?
3280845	3281446	Then screw you.
3281906	3282166	Okay.
3282446	3282806	Alright.
3284187	3284928	Then why don't you?
3284948	3285688	What's wrong with you?
3286549	3287530	I like gorillas just fine.
3287810	3289331	You know I love to be devil's advocate though.
3289699	3289899	I know.
3317202	3318963	I don't really want to comment on that game.
3319383	3326388	Anyways, what's kind of interesting is they described the brand new damage system in Forza 2.
3327029	3334854	And this is all coming from the latest issue of the 360 Magazine, including that it took six months to create.
3335314	3341798	Three damage settings will be available in the game, low, normal, and simulation, for those who don't want to...
3343150	3343590	They joke.
3344010	3346451	Reenact the great Gizmondo Ferrari crash.
3348612	3355595	For photo and TV modes, they're actually collaborating with the Project Gotham development team, Bizarre Creations.
3355995	3363678	So they're going to have something similar to Forza TV, very similar to Gotham TV that was in Project Gotham Racing 3.
3364238	3369400	And of course, better AI, better graphics, downloadable content, yadda yadda yadda yadda.
3371055	3372797	Blizzard's got some new ideas for World of Warcraft
3398826	3399406	Oh, really?
3400327	3400847	Yeah, really.
3405630	3415416	Basically, they're preparing a new transfer system that will let World of Warcraft players move their characters to less polluted realms for a $25 fee.
3418198	3427564	They're basically wanting to offer these services for convenience as opposed to encouraging people to spread out through the realms.
3428356	3429817	Seriously.
3429857	3430077	Seriously.
3455373	3460435	I mean, the alternative is just to re-roll in completely new characters, so it's not much of a decision there.
3462875	3465316	There will be restrictions on realm transfers.
3465977	3471718	You can only bring a character once every six months, and once you've transferred, you can't take them back.
3472399	3473619	The character has to be at least level 10.
3474279	3479861	There's the amount of cash you can bring with you, 300 gold for levels 10 through 30, 1,000 for 31 through 50, and 5,000 through 51 and above.
3483447	3485309	You can only transfer to realms of the same type.
3486129	3490753	PvP, PvE, I guess roleplay ones too.
3492474	3496778	They're also talking about Cross Realm Battlegrounds feature that's coming in with Patch 1.12.
3496818	3498920	That's cool.
3499080	3506306	It will link Altric Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so you can fight with players from other realms.
3506426	3510109	Hopefully they don't link the fucking Looking for Group channel across multiple servers.
3510629	3512051	LFG, WSG...
3513735	3516277	I mean, okay, devil's advocate here.
3517258	3524464	Yay, so we can have our blue bee groups trashed by tier three, no matter where they are.
3525425	3542579	I mean, what are the odds, you figure, of Cross Realm Battlegrounds having, okay, you have this basic pickup group, unskilled players facing completely organized over voice chat people are just going to roll straight over them.
3544292	3550114	Same rule on Ragnarok, you know, if you don't wanna, you know, you don't do War of Imperium if you're level 10.
3550574	3553075	Step up or ship out, bitch!
3553395	3556996	There's a big gap between raiders and non-raiders, and you see that a lot on the forums.
3557516	3561557	The people who do the big raid instances do better in PvP.
3561757	3563537	It's not much a matter of skill.
3563618	3567118	I think they should call it World of Warcraft Hardcore Edition.
3567139	3568619	This is for the hardcore.
3569341	3576103	Also, Patch 1.12 is going to bring in a new type of world PvP.
3576683	3582424	You will see Horde and Alliance players trying to gain control of strategic positions.
3583024	3585465	And Rogues will get a talent review.
3585785	3589946	To this I say it's about damn time on both counts.
3590426	3592527	Rogues have needed a talent change for a while.
3592847	3593847	They just need some tweaks.
3594467	3596848	And world PvP, because of Battlegrounds, because...
3597410	3601933	are actually objectives in Battlegrounds has effectively killed off world PvP.
3602873	3604614	So both of those need a revamp.
3604935	3605775	I'm glad they're getting them.
3607816	3611539	Going back to the price for a minute for character transfer, I think $25 is fair, actually.
3612019	3612439	I do agree.
3612719	3616602	Because it makes sure that people really want to do it and it's not just people taking advantage of it.
3616642	3624106	Because even if it was $5, I think $25 means that it's only people who really want to be with their friends and really want to do it.
3624166	3625087	Because otherwise...
3625606	3626206	Thank you very much.
3626226	3627307	What are you doing over there, Loki?
3627327	3627467	I'm not.
3653965	3655026	Searching for Porn.
3655046	3655507	Sure.
3655687	3659211	I'm trying to get my program newsletcher to work because it's not.
3659251	3660212	It wants me to buy it.
3660592	3660792	Alright.
3660812	3661253	I don't want to.
3661833	3668020	Anyways, although if you don't want to buy stuff and you want to save some money, well, you're still going to have to buy stuff, but
3668459	3668919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3697711	3698331	www.orangeloungeradio.com
3717265	3719388	and just kind of our reasonings why we're doing it.
3719468	3723594	First off, we here at Orange Launch Radio do not like to edit the show unless we absolutely have to.
3724094	3727338	We would never edit out someone's opinion on anything.
3727378	3732485	The only thing we edit out are complete fuck-ups like, you know, we forget to start the show right or whatever.
3733026	3735329	The story's not up that we need or what have you.
3736251	3746277	and now though we're going to start editing out Skype calls that are not up to a certain quality standard and we don't want to scare you guys off from calling in.
3746297	3747337	That's not what we're trying to do.
3747698	3755782	We're never going to censor your opinions but the problem is just based on some feedback that we're getting from folks that are listening to the show and posting on the forums and talking to friends is that
3756138	3756699	www.DarkSakura.com
3779198	3779719	www.darksakura.com
3796078	3819991	And you can actually call in and leave us a voicemail And actually, what I'd like to know your opinions on this week for the voicemail We're going to start making this a regular segment I would really like to hear your voicemails later Actually, I'll give you the topic after the Skype calls Because then otherwise people want to call in and talk about it But we're going to have like a weekly topic to call in about So anyway, let's go to the phone's Skype line and see what you guys have to say
3821175	3822336	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3822376	3822796	Who's this?
3823477	3824057	It's Ranma.
3824077	3824857	Can you hear me now?
3825078	3825958	Of course I can hear you.
3825998	3826619	What's up, Ranma?
3826639	3827099	What's on your mind?
3827739	3828180	Not much.
3828240	3830601	I finally recovered from Anime Next last weekend.
3830901	3831662	From Anime Next?
3831702	3832182	How was that?
3832883	3836625	It was fun, but there was a lot of drama with the game room, but I'll save that for later.
3836785	3837846	Well, no, I want to hear it.
3837886	3839187	What was the drama in the game room?
3839867	3841288	Have you heard of Desktop Arcade?
3842029	3842229	Yes.
3843001	3844484	They were banned from Anime Next
3854651	3859812	It seems that somebody stole their passes from last year, photocopied them, and went into the game room.
3860233	3868995	And it seems that the guy who runs the game room, Kevin, who's also known as Assembler, who owns Assembler.org, basically blacklisted them from the con.
3869375	3875637	And whenever you mention it on the forums about why they weren't there, he will go in and edit your post and delete it as if it never existed.
3877137	3878338	That's a little weird.
3878378	3880118	That's almost a little too hardcore.
3880138	3883179	They didn't post anything like why they're gone or whatever?
3883973	3884233	Nope.
3884453	3887856	Every time you ask them why or whatever, your post is deleted.
3887896	3888576	That's freaky.
3888596	3889997	That's like a KGB thing.
3890597	3893639	I came very close to getting banned on the forums, but I stopped.
3893679	3898462	Because if I got banned, I know senior staffs that would probably have his head on a fucking platter.
3898622	3902425	Should we make a call to Desktop Arcade, get one of them on the show, try to get their side of the story?
3903085	3903706	Sure, why not?
3903826	3905187	I can arrange that.
3905447	3905847	You know what?
3905927	3906487	Open invite.
3906528	3907348	You tell them we want them.
3907448	3908068	I'd love to hear it.
3908789	3909569	Wouldn't you guys?
3910070	3910890	I see heads.
3911311	3911931	Alright, let's hear it.
3912390	3914751	Anyway, sorry buddy, what else is going on in Anime Next?
3915572	3916492	It was pretty fun.
3917673	3922976	It was hot as hell, but luckily my hotel was like 15 feet away from the expo center.
3923576	3924997	It was huge, it was great.
3925077	3927218	The only thing that really sucked was the acoustics.
3928479	3930119	Hmm, what was wrong with the acoustics?
3930159	3934842	Just, you know, hard to hear things and sound bouncing everywhere or what?
3935602	3940505	Yes, think of it as like a giant warehouse and they were dividing everything with these heavy curtains.
3941598	3943680	What kind of cool video game related things did you see there?
3943700	3947743	I know it's a lot of anime, but since we're a gaming show, what kind of cool video game things did you see there?
3948564	3953248	Not too much, because I went into the game room, the funk just hit me and I passed out.
3953768	3963517	But I did go into the dealer's room and I did see some DS lights on imports, white PSPs, and I saw a lot of import games.
3964318	3971123	Ronma, I was actually hanging out with my friend Julie yesterday and she's going to Anime Expo this year.
3972744	3975086	The only reason I see to go there this year is because Clamp's there.
3975706	3978428	Yeah, I want to go, but my wizard costume's not done.
3978869	3984533	Well, she's talking about buying some of those miniature bottles of Febreze to go around spraying the fanboy funk.
3986004	3986685	Thank you for watching!
4003306	4022651	It is important that you bathe on a regular basis, that you use soap to clean the germs off your body, and that you use something like deodorant, cologne, I don't know, something to make sure that you're going to smell unoffensive when you're in a room tightly packed, especially a hot room, as Ranma's telling us his con was pretty hot, around all these people.
4022711	4028672	So please, don't give gamers a bad name, such as these folks at Anime Next, that were stinking up the room.
4029472	4031953	Bathe regularly, and you know,
4033411	4035692	Bring the smell of flowers into gaming rooms everywhere.
4037792	4039033	Go on, go on.
4039053	4048535	I actually met somebody at Anime Expo a few years ago who actually was one of those I'm going to sleep in the lobby of the hotel or in the movie room type people.
4049336	4055958	Only he actually would go into the men's room and clean himself at the sink.
4056278	4057218	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
4057506	4060688	Bandit in the chat room has the best idea ever for a cosplay.
4061048	4063470	Someone should dress up as a big bottle of Febreze.
4064771	4065691	Here's one for you.
4065971	4071635	One anime con when they passed out their registration bags had little bars of soap in each of the bags.
4071895	4075898	And don't you know the people got pissed off and offended.
4078058	4080240	I would actually like to quote my friend Megzi.
4080700	4080980	Okay.
4081461	4081921	Herbo.
4082281	4083602	Horrible otaku body odor.
4084883	4085924	Why would you be offended at that?
4085984	4087205	I look at it as a free gift.
4087285	4089367	People fucking steal hotel soap all the time.
4089947	4091588	You know what I say the cons should do?
4092289	4092509	What?
4093370	4095411	They should have an anonymous shower room.
4095451	4099455	Take one of the hotel rooms, someone just stands there with a sheet.
4099655	4102157	You go in, sign it, take your shower, and leave.
4102177	4102577	100% anonymous.
4102597	4102657	Wow.
4105714	4108596	Alright, anyway, we gotta wrap this up so we can get to another call.
4108616	4111337	But any other thoughts on the cons or gaming or what have you?
4112098	4113258	It was fun overall.
4113298	4115360	I'm gonna post a couple of links and that's it.
4115380	4116560	The first one's for Jamie.
4117181	4119022	Ranma would have cosplay in full effect.
4119042	4121643	There was a bunch of Ranma would have cosplays running around.
4122064	4122324	Alright.
4122884	4124605	Alright, thank you very much Ranma for the call.
4124625	4125466	We appreciate it, okay?
4125626	4126786	Sure, no problem.
4126866	4127327	Later, buddy.
4127827	4128087	Later.
4128287	4129348	We always like it when he calls in.
4130200	4133322	DMN, I need some ATH points to Bandit.
4133402	4135744	I know it's your contest, but Bandit, come on.
4135904	4136944	That was some points right there.
4137345	4138565	Let's go to another phone call.
4138625	4139886	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4139906	4140326	Who's this?
4140927	4142007	Hi, Sky.
4142047	4142748	It's RavensDolphin.
4142768	4143508	Hey, RavensDolphin.
4143528	4144209	What's on your mind, buddy?
4145069	4145810	Phoenix Wright.
4146550	4147191	Phoenix Wright.
4147211	4149452	You know, I've kind of looked at this game a little bit.
4149592	4150253	It's kind of neat.
4150313	4152474	Have you just recently started playing this game?
4153482	4153982	Sort of.
4154122	4158765	I bought it for a week and I found it in EB for $30 and it rocks.
4159746	4160546	Lucky you.
4160746	4162127	What do you like about Phoenix Wright?
4162987	4165949	Well, I just like that the music is great.
4166029	4168651	When you nail someone, it goes like, Objection!
4168691	4169311	You did this!
4170666	4171006	Okay, wait.
4171326	4174808	Miklatov just walked in the room, so I've got to put him on the spot here.
4174888	4177469	Miklatov, you've been playing Phoenix Wright.
4177529	4178389	I finished it.
4178589	4181130	What do you love so much about the game?
4181490	4183151	It's like playing Law and Order.
4183771	4185031	That's pretty much what I like.
4185111	4185892	And it's funny.
4186032	4187092	It's really, really funny.
4187372	4188233	What's so funny about it?
4188273	4189553	There's nothing funny about Law.
4189953	4191854	The writing is really hilarious.
4192154	4198136	And the names they come up with for the characters, like Law to Heart and Somebody Von Karma.
4198196	4198937	I forget his name.
4200257	4224701	Manfred Von Karma and it was seriously he's the one with the evil voice right objection it's i couldn't put it down until i finished it i have all these other games i was playing too i was like i'm not taking this out of my ds it just seems to me like that game is an awful lot of reading though so what keeps this game kind of guy interesting yes raven's dolphin uh because it has a lot of reading i i read pretty well i don't i can't read a
4224841	4226862	Mike Meekins You will find out once you play through it.
4226882	4227242	Mike Meekins
4254858	4256879	I'm getting that launch day for this game.
4257119	4257659	I gotta get it.
4269426	4270647	Oh, okay, Phoenix Wright 2, Justice for All.
4270687	4273108	Megatop, tell us real quick, wait, before you go back, how does it work in Japan?
4273268	4274569	There's the different games in Japan.
4274629	4276771	How many are out in Japan, and what's been translated over here?
4276811	4285015	There's three on Game Boy Advance, and then they're making a new one on DS4, and it doesn't have Phoenix Wright in it anymore, at least that we know of so far.
4285416	4287397	It's a different attorney this time.
4288417	4288518	And...
4289639	4296965	What's really cool is my coworker, she wasn't able to get the American one, but they just re-released the Japanese one in Japan.
4297205	4300428	And it has a, well, of course they released it in Japan if it's Japanese.
4300848	4304491	Yeah, you can toggle between English or Japanese in the game.
4304571	4311917	So if you can't find it in America right now, you can go on an import site and just get that re-release of the Japanese one.
4311937	4312977	You can still play it in English.
4313618	4313958	Awesome.
4314318	4318362	Gravis Dolphin, any other thoughts there on Phoenix Riot or gaming in general?
4319895	4323216	What was the worst game you ever played in your life?
4323896	4324716	I can tell you mine.
4324776	4326516	It was Deadly Towers for the Nest.
4326616	4327817	That game was horrible.
4329437	4332237	Worst game I've ever played in my life.
4332637	4333598	Oh my gosh.
4336918	4346140	Do you remember Color Dreams, which was a company that played these games on the NES that were in those really colored cartridges?
4346160	4346240	Yes.
4347641	4352504	Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who The NES version of X-Men Oh my god!
4352524	4352905	That was awful!
4372811	4376833	or most people would say... The Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man.
4377293	4377754	Oh, God.
4378114	4378634	Or E.T.
4379775	4379995	E.T.
4380015	4380675	was worse.
4380735	4381376	Superman 64.
4382496	4389740	I hate to be trendy here and kind of saying what everybody else says, but honestly, dude, Wand of Gamelon, Zelda...
4391045	4391445	I'm sorry.
4391866	4392266	I'm sorry.
4411952	4413672	Really that bad.
4413713	4419554	And I'm sure you can even download the movies on YouTube and that doesn't even begin just because the gameplay itself is horrible.
4419834	4423955	I mean, what was Nintendo thinking letting these guys just poop on the Link franchise?
4424856	4426316	These guys literally shit on Link.
4426916	4430137	Okay, now that you're our guinea pig, go play Big Rigs.
4430697	4431497	I would rather not.
4433058	4434298	They crapped on Mario 2?
4435118	4435818	Mario's Hotel?
4435878	4436439	That was horrible.
4436819	4437659	Oh god, yeah, yeah.
4438621	4440267	Alright, Ravenstaff and thanks for the question.
4440287	4442013	Actually, there's another game that I thought was pretty awful.
4442034	4442335	What's that?
4442736	4443920	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
4445215	4445876	I hate you.
4446336	4447857	I wouldn't put it in worst game ever, though.
4447917	4449318	It's not worst game ever.
4449738	4453160	However, it shouldn't have carried the Final Fantasy name because it was way too much of a child's game.
4453240	4453981	Okay, okay.
4454461	4456402	It fit the niche that it was designed for, though.
4456422	4457142	It was an entry-level RPG.
4457162	4458003	Right, but you're right.
4458043	4458903	A, it shouldn't have been Final Fantasy.
4458923	4460384	It shouldn't have been Final Fantasy.
4460444	4463186	What I will give that game, though, is that it actually has a pretty kick-ass soundtrack.
4463566	4463766	Yeah.
4463866	4464667	All things considered.
4464727	4471391	I mean, whoever did it, I know it was a female that did the music there, and I think she came over to, I could be wrong, but I think she made some of the music in 11.
4471891	4472392	I might be wrong.
4472432	4472972	Don't quote me on that.
4473359	4475420	But it's got a great soundtrack, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
4475460	4480682	You know, now that I think about it, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest would probably have fit in better had they called it a saga.
4481422	4483083	Not Romancing Saga, but Saga.
4483243	4484243	Yeah, that's what I think.
4484703	4486744	Because, honestly, it wasn't ever a Final Fantasy game.
4486764	4488865	That's great, because all the other Saga games are shit.
4489125	4489605	No, they're not!
4489625	4490585	I hate you, Ben!
4490985	4492406	I don't like the Saga games at all.
4492486	4493226	Saga Frontier 2.
4493266	4493466	Saga 3.
4493506	4494707	I don't like Saga at all.
4494727	4496227	I'm sorry, Romancing Saga 2.
4496267	4497048	Romancing Saga 3, too.
4497068	4497188	Yeah.
4497208	4497288	But...
4501152	4501772	Raven's Dolphin, Ping Pals
4521921	4522662	Oh, that was horrible.
4522722	4523583	I bought that.
4523703	4526866	I bought two copies.
4526926	4530529	I feel sorry because I know somebody gave it to me as a gift, but it really is a bad game.
4531070	4533092	Play Burnout Legends on the DS.
4533252	4533912	You'll cry.
4534833	4536655	Anyway, I've got to let you go, Ravensdoth.
4536675	4537676	We've got to keep moving on the show.
4537836	4538376	Thank you so much.
4538396	4539678	This is way too long.
4539718	4540398	Appreciate it, buddy.
4540438	4540859	Have a good one.
4541639	4542200	Oh, he just hung up.
4543281	4544082	We appreciate the call.
4545369	4547675	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?
4547976	4551587	It's the one and only Legend of Zaku Hi, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?
4552385	4559831	Um, Coney Island just got Supernova last Friday, um, and it started to trickle, it started to trickle down on the east coast from what I'm hearing.
4559991	4563354	So what are your impressions of DDR Supernova after playing it, which I imagine you have?
4563374	4577065	Um, from one, from one, from one thing, I, we seem to, we seem to agree that it might be a beta cab because after comparing it to the one in Jersey Gardens, which I happened to play, which was a location test, it was a lot of differences in it.
4577506	4579988	First of all, certain songs were coming in very early.
4581031	4583933	You know, in other words, there was early timing on songs such as You're Not Here.
4585394	4588276	The pads, you know, were really stiff, obviously, because they're brand new.
4589016	4597141	Besides that, you know, a lot of things that are just, you know, just the fact that, not really, I'm trying to think right now.
4597921	4600223	It's just, we're not sure if this is it.
4600583	4605626	Because, you know, it looks to me like it's the same build that I played before.
4606046	4608608	Okay, Zaku, thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs middle?
4610405	4617752	It's so and so, I just hope Konami's playing the cards right, because if this is the final version, God help us all.
4618212	4618713	Why?
4619093	4620715	Just because of the early timings and stuff?
4621175	4628722	No, just because of the fact that it's harder to get perfects now, it's harder to get double A's, because the timing window's really tight now.
4629083	4634328	I thought people were bitching that DDR was too easy, all the In The Groove fans were bitching it was too easy.
4635026	4637288	No, but I think they OD'd on the timing window.
4638209	4641412	At first it started to be too loose, and now it's starting to be too tight.
4641812	4643314	I guess it should have been right there in the middle.
4645255	4645616	Interesting.
4646781	4653063	Besides that... What's been the general, because I imagine these arcades are packed, what's the general fan consensus that you're picking up?
4653103	4655884	Are people happy to see a new DDR game back in arcades?
4656504	4661706	Or are people bitching on these little... They're not bitching, so to say.
4661746	4666748	They just really don't know what to believe, whether or not they are betas or real.
4667428	4672610	And the only way we're going to find that out is the second location in New York City when it's set up tomorrow, which is in Chinatown.
4673157	4675800	Well, we'll be eagerly awaiting a forum post letting us know.
4676641	4678643	Actually, I'm going to link you to one right now.
4679584	4687933	I'm going to link you to a thread that actually shows the reaction from New Yorkers about the Supernova set up in Coney Island.
4687973	4690455	And that's in our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4690475	4691256	Click on chat.
4691757	4694880	I don't have time to read it right now because we're trying to do a show, but I'll check it out later.
4695785	4703107	Alright, just keep in mind that Konami's just fooling around with the whole release date thing, so I really don't know what to believe right now.
4703167	4707988	I don't know whether, as I said, I don't know whether these are betas, or is this the final thing.
4708208	4709008	It's up in the air right now.
4709048	4711228	What else are people playing in New York City besides DDR?
4712629	4715749	Just stuff in the groove and stuff.
4716510	4718210	Is that all people do in New York, just dance?
4719599	4721260	Is that all people do in New York is dance?
4722040	4729062	No, but they do other things like, you know, in Chinatown they play fighting games, but, you know, they have lives to live as well.
4729382	4730643	It's something we do on the side.
4730923	4732923	Zaka, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.
4732943	4733784	Thanks so much for the call.
4734364	4734624	Okay.
4734764	4735024	Later.
4735204	4735444	Bye.
4735704	4735884	Bye.
4736805	4738045	Oh, I gotta let this call through.
4738485	4739686	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4739726	4740146	Who's this?
4740986	4741586	This is Bandit.
4741746	4742487	Hi, Bandit.
4742547	4746268	You know, you won points earlier, so I decided to take one more call because I saw it was you.
4746308	4746888	What's on your mind?
4747605	4748706	Thanks, yeah, I appreciate that.
4748846	4750106	He wasn't giving me points anyways.
4750707	4750987	Jerk.
4751167	4751407	All right.
4751427	4751887	I'll take him.
4751987	4752768	That's his we.
4753288	4754609	All right.
4754869	4755930	What's on your mind, buddy?
4756750	4757851	It's just on the last call.
4758191	4759612	He was complaining about the timing window.
4760892	4766175	The only thing they did differently is they just made the marvelous timing the perfect timing now.
4767536	4769257	Supposedly from the post I've been reading.
4770218	4770518	Okay.
4770538	4771518	That's all they did.
4771838	4772579	But, I mean...
4772935	4775697	Bandit, I asked Zaku this, and I'll ask you this.
4775977	4795051	Weren't most DDR players that went over to In The Groove or whatever claiming, and honestly, guys, just play both and enjoy both, but weren't people that went over to In The Groove kind of complaining that the difficulty was too easy on DDR, which is kind of why they wanted a harder game like In The Groove, and now that Konami's went and made the game harder, they're upset?
4796035	4798236	Well, I've argued with so many people about this.
4798836	4803778	A lot of people went to ITG just because they thought there weren't going to be a new DDR coming out.
4804539	4808661	Then they complain about the difficulty in DDR, or not being hard enough.
4809001	4815183	It's not because of the grading, it's because of the actual step charts of the song that I keep getting people complaining to me about.
4815263	4821326	They're always like, oh, this step chart's not hard enough, or this isn't like this and that, on in the groove, and they keep comparing it back and forth.
4822286	4825668	Well, they got to remember, there wouldn't be any ITG without DDR first.
4828478	4828938	That's true.
4829279	4833381	There are harder step charts in DDR now.
4834381	4836782	Unless they're AAAing everything, I don't want to hear any complaints.
4836922	4838403	I don't want to hear any of this stuff again.
4842185	4844426	Do you live in an area where Supernova is on its way, or what?
4846287	4847107	I live in Pittsburgh.
4847508	4848248	We didn't get one yet.
4848928	4850329	It's on its way, though.
4851109	4851489	Alright.
4852750	4856232	Well, Bandit, thanks so much for calling in and giving your perspective on Supernova.
4856252	4856692	I appreciate it.
4857338	4858318	Alright man, thanks for the points.
4859459	4860619	Well, no problem.
4861600	4875366	I'm getting razzed for that in the chat room now because apparently I've ruffled the panties of DMN and he's a little upset now because I was arguing with him whether you should have points or not and I should just keep my big fat opinion out of it and let him run his contest.
4875666	4877947	Just keep on leeching points for me, you bastard.
4878587	4880188	Alright, Bandit, have a good one.
4880788	4881789	Alright, you guys do the same.
4881829	4882389	Alright, bye.
4883499	4886620	Yes, I realize DMN does not have to be doing a contest.
4886700	4887600	I am very grateful.
4887660	4888660	He already knows that.
4889061	4892902	But I still have to give him shit because that's what I do on this program is I give our chatters shit.
4893282	4895662	But know that I do that because I love you very much.
4896943	4898483	Last minute stories, boys and girls.
4898823	4900604	Anything final you guys want to bring up?
4900884	4901524	Actually, I do.
4902744	4905625	One of my friends on LiveJournal linked this story on Kotaku.
4907997	4925830	There's a contest going on through July where if you buy a copy of Tetris during that time period and register the serial at Club Nintendo, you can choose to battle Utada Hikaru or get concert tickets.
4926690	4932715	30 people will be chosen to play against her and 504 pairs of tickets will be given out.
4933992	4940797	Um, now the thing is, though, is that there's a video of her playing, and it's actually up on YouTube.
4941497	4942978	She completely owns this guy.
4943799	4946840	She plays really, really well.
4948121	4958788	Um, you can either see the movie file up on Kotaku, or you can check it out, do a search on YouTube, but, yeah, she's really good at Tetris.
4959068	4961190	DMN is putting out a challenge right there.
4961270	4962971	He says, I'll fuck up Utada.
4964440	4968303	I think that's a Tetris DS challenge in the making right there.
4968463	4969023	It's on.
4969103	4970304	The gauntlet's been thrown down.
4970925	4971885	Utada, if you're listening.
4971965	4983233	I would love to play her because actually the thing I noticed, she plays Tetris the same way I do, which is build up for the four line and it keeps hopping up.
4983293	4989077	Even them out to where you have the full four lines down the next one.
4989638	4991419	That's exactly how I play Tetris.
4991679	4993080	So that would be very fun, I think.
4994758	4995799	Now that's a girl gamer.
4996840	4997200	Well done.
4998481	4999502	Anything last minute?
4999542	4999982	Anybody else?
5000142	5002304	Yeah, there was something interesting I should point out.
5003505	5016436	It was pointed out that 99 Nights, one of the things that happens to be on Microsoft's site, I believe, is showing the product info for 99 Nights.
5017357	5020339	And it's interesting because it says hard drive required.
5021480	5023802	One of the things that I thought Microsoft was not going to do
5024318	5026478	with their games is require you to have a hard drive.
5026618	5029359	And such an anticipated game, too.
5029699	5029959	Ouch.
5030939	5036080	So all of those out there that don't have a hard drive, you're kind of fucked.
5036160	5042802	Unless this pans out to be just a mistake or something, but that's pretty... Well, they had that one, was it Football Manager or something like that?
5042822	5043942	They required the hard drive.
5044362	5045502	I'm thinking this is the way they're going.
5045582	5049243	Why they're releasing the 256 megabyte card then is beyond me.
5049283	5052584	Just lower the price of the hard drive or release a larger hard drive.
5053191	5057614	I don't know, but it has hard drive required and hard drive enhanced is two of the things on there.
5058435	5060176	So, I thought that was interesting.
5062678	5063139	Who knows?
5064880	5065280	Interesting.
5065821	5067122	Anything else last minute, you guys?
5070424	5070545	No.
5071806	5073067	There was another thing also I had.
5073127	5076729	Genesis Collection is coming to PlayStation 2 and the PSP.
5077330	5080672	It's going to have a collection of old Genesis games, 28 of them, and
5083110	5096193	with the additional three being unlocked, including Shinobi 2, Sonic the Hedgehog, Golden Axe 1, 2, and 3, Virtual Fighter 2, Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, and Phantasy Star.
5097153	5098533	Rise from your grave.
5101133	5104054	All right, well, then I guess that's going to do it for tonight's show.
5104614	5108395	We're just about wrapped up here, but we want to go around first and get everybody's final thought.
5108435	5109255	It's been a long time.
5109531	5110292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5133493	5138816	Thank you very much for your support of Orange Entree over the years and glad to see you're local and can drop by once in a while.
5139856	5140297	Final thought?
5140957	5142678	I got sex appeal because I dual wield.
5143998	5144299	Nerd.
5144499	5145459	Loki, your final thought?
5145719	5149641	I want to play this game Senko no Ronde for the 360.
5150222	5151122	It looks like Einhander.
5152123	5155464	And my final thought is Head Hurts must run Ice Cube.
5155965	5158906	Ice Cube shampoo would be great right now for my sunburned head.
5159006	5162648	For those of you guys listening to my FU in Part A. Dark Sakura, your final thought?
5163118	5165019	Reject false icons and give me a taco.
5165039	5166440	Have a great week.
5166460	5167040	We'll see you next time.
