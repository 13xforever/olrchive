13
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,820
Royale of which I'll win because I'm vicious why would we do that I don't

14
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,940

15
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,460
I don't want to die.

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,380
We'll fake it.

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,860
For those who were listening live last week,

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,500
we were talking about the Americanization

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,540
of Battle Royale a little bit.

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,420
I don't remember if it was after the show or in the middle

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,300
or something we were talking about,

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,660
Americanization of Battle Royale,

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,020
and that whole thought still makes me kind of sad.

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,260
I don't know, it's just, they're not gonna get it right.

25
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,780
You know they're not gonna get it right.

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,540
It completely just makes me want to go crawl to the corner

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,740
and cry for an hour.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,820
I hope it's a rumor.

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,660
I hope it's a sick, sad rumor.

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,540
It's not a rumor, I've heard it from people.

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,660
IT'S NOT A RUMOR!

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,380
Tumor...

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,560
Uh, anyway, also-

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,960
Yeah, the movie will be a tumor.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,920
Also say hello to our invisible fourth guest, but they're really there.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,400
It's our chat room over at www.orangelandre.com, click on chat.

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,340
It's your guys' show too, we love to put in your comments and everything.

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,820
And I'll tell you what, we have some sick fans.

39
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,300
Because I was just talking to one before the show tonight, we have somebody from the UK who's listening tonight.

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,540
So say hello to Digi Nova, listening for the first time.

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,040
Hello!

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,640
I think there was somebody else in there that said they were listening for the first time tonight as well.

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,540
I think it was, uh, Anoshi, and I apologize if I butchered that name. Anoshi. Anoshi.

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,240
Uh, also listening for the first time tonight. Not from the UK, but still.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,440
Uh, thanks to you guys for listening. Of course, a big hello to everybody in there tonight,

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,140
listening for the first time, the hundredth time, or whatever the case may be.

47
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,940
Uh, let's talk about our gaming week. We always like to start off the show talking about the games we've been playing.

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,640
Dark Sakura, start us off.

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,080
I played a number of things over the course of this week.

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,780
I got my DS Lite after the show, and so I've been playing Animal Crossing again this week.

51
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:58,740
And I've also been playing the, on the Japanese website locoroco.jp, they have the demo for

52
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,280
Locoroco for PSP, and I've been playing the hell out of that today.

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,600
And Osutatakai Oendan today, which is actually harder than I thought it would be, but it's

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,720
It's kind of hard to play if you have somebody else's music playing over it and can't really

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,080
listen very well.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,400
So yeah, I got to the second stage and then I was like, okay, headache time, because two

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,080
musics because my friend Krista was over playing, she was playing Loco at the time.

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,920
So I've been in Port Happy.

59
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,640
When's Krista coming to the show?

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,200
You know, I tried to get her to come tonight, but she had to drive back to Davis.

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,480
When you two get together, it's comedy gold.

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
So we need her on the show.

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,980
she'll come for the big four-year anniversary next week we're having we're

64
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,480
having a fourth birthday party we're celebrating we're celebrating our that

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,940
was great radio by the way when he held up your fingers we're celebrating our

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,280
entrance into preschool next week it should be fun yeah I'm trying to find

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,320
people to come next week but yeah that's oh yeah I turned on World of Warcraft

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,280
and then shut it back down because I was like I don't want to play I've actually done that before

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,500
force if it was Final Fantasy XI, like I boo- and you know how Final Fantasy XI has that

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,360
huge old boot-up sequence that goes with it? Like I get all the-

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Which I turned off?

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,280
Yeah, well, you still have to go through that frickin' play online and all that stuff before

73
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
you get in the game-

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
When you get there though, it's like, enter, enter, enter, enter.

75
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Seriously. And I've done that before where I went in the whole way and then like I finally

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
get in there like, you know, three minutes later and I'm like, you know what, why did

77
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,320
I do that? I don't really want to play this. I don't have the time to LFP. I don't have

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,680
the time for this today.

79
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,880
I think there's better things to do with my time than to immerse myself into an MMO.

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,680
I don't know what you hear about my gaming week, but we'll get to that in a minute.

81
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Addict.

82
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Addict!

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Anything else?

84
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
No.

85
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,680
How's that LocoRoco?

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
It's crack.

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
I love the music.

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
It's on drugs.

89
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,280
I went to the website for LocoRoco a few weeks ago, because they have like a mini version

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,000
of the game, like all in Flash, and I thought the music was so adorable.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's cute.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,180
But it's like it's really frustrating cuz then cuz I find myself trying to tilt the PSP upside down trying to tilt the world

93
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,500
And trying to get it to go and then you get up to the moon

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,140
It's like no you have to have twice as many pieces of your body as you have now

95
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,680
Well crap and then you fall down the little hole when you split into multiple pieces you fall down the hole and then something comes

96
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,120
In each part of you. It's like no you're not supposed to do that spit me out

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,580
out and and and that's it you know that game reminds me of an old-ass Super

98
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,420
Nintendo game called on the ball did you ever play that it looks like it horrid

99
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,240
the mode 7 that's all you did was you spun the screen so you can't really

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,100
pick up your TV and intern it so you know you were pretty ease the L&R

101
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,980
buttons on the Super Nintendo because you do on a local Rocco that's cool but

102
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,100
it's funny I was looking at the screen I was like Rocco Rocco and it's it's yeah

103
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,040
it's all super Japanese everything isn't Japanese so but it's like really

104
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,240
easy Japanese so it's not like that hard to read it everything's like in written

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,720
in katakana so it's super easy unless you're like me and you don't understand

106
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,120
the lick of Japanese no matter what katakana hiragana I don't want to know

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,480
the difference I I know there's two but that's just because after doing this

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,240
show for four years and listening to you bitch about enough Japanese games I

109
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,280
picked up that my job is done all right low-key how was your gaming week it was

110
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:27,240
pretty good. What did I play? I played a lot of Jewel Quest and I actually beat the game

111
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,620
finally but except the only thing is you have to play it through like six different difficulties

112
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,060
which is kind of lame but I don't know. And then a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers.

113
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,420
I was going to be playing point blank DS but a certain GameStop didn't have it in. Looked

114
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,540
to be crazy when asked for it. Point blank on a DS? Who would want that game? That sounds

115
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,140
cool. It is cool. But they're not cool. Remember how you were talking about before in the distributor

116
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,420
world how certain titles are broken down, like you have your AA titles and your A title,

117
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,940
like a AA title would be like, what, Grand Theft Auto or something really big, Halo,

118
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,180
you know, and then like your A titles, which are kind of big, and then like B titles, C

119
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,580
titles, what is point blank like an E title or something, apparently? I have it as a triple

120
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,260
It's a long-running franchise and it would've been perfect for the DS, but apparently GameStop

121
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
doesn't think that way.

122
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,820
GameStop's more concerned of Urban Chaos or Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.

123
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,640
Yeah, I can't play them on a DS, dumbass, and this is probably the only solid DS title

124
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,380
coming out this week.

125
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,680
But no, they're more concerned with, you know, ripping me off on turning in my DVDs now.

126
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,300
By the way, they mostly, all their DVDs, they magically don't have in their system, therefore

127
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,320
they have to give you the generic price, which is 75 cents, to which I told them to fuck

128
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
off.

129
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:54,100
Um, actually, that, DVDs don't really sell, so that's...

130
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,100
I know, our company buys it back from them.

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,140
Take them to a video clearance center or whatever.

132
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
I know.

133
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
Sorry, that's local.

134
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Anyway.

135
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,140
It's so far away.

136
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,140
But anyway.

137
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,140
So yeah, they sucked.

138
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
And um...

139
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
No they don't.

140
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
They pay my bills.

141
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
But they suck.

142
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Uh...

143
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
No they don't.

144
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
They pay my bills.

145
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,100
You don't carry point blank children, were they Samsas?

146
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,020
Well I'm not driving all the way over there, so.

147
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,020
Alright.

148
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
Loki games.

149
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,600
So anyways, um, I played through Blazing Angels, I'm trying to beat the game so I can sell

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,980
it back because it sucks.

151
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,420
I don't know what they were trying to do with the art style in the game but it's really

152
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,860
annoying because when you're flying there's this big dark black crap on the outside of

153
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,960
the screen that's, I don't know what it's supposed to look like.

154
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,360
Is it because I'm blacking out because I'm flying or is it supposed to be what?

155
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,040
But when I'm shooting at something everything else gets dark on the outside and bright in

156
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
the middle.

157
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,560
It's like I have a TV with bad contrast or something and it just can't fix itself.

158
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,920
That's what the whole game plays like and so I don't get that.

159
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,560
The game is kind of retarded but hopefully least achievements there's only seven of them

160
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,600
and it's pretty easy it's just like beating the game a couple times.

161
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,600
or points or... I got it for free, okay? So I'm gonna sell it back after we get all the achievements.

162
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,600
So is that the only reason it sucks, the graphics? Or is it just not a fun game or what?

163
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,600
The graphics and the fact that the camera is really annoying.

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,600
And the camera a lot of times you can lock on different planes to see where they are so you can select a target.

165
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
The only problem is though is there's so many planes flying around it's hard to target anything.

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,600
And half the time it targets the wrong thing. It's just like Grand Theft Auto. It targets the wrong objects. So that's kind of annoying.

167
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,600
So the camera, the graphics are really annoying. Otherwise it's okay. I was playing some multiplayer on it and that's kind of fun.

168
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I think that's probably the only reason you'd want to get it. It's just multiplayer.

169
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:58,600
But to be honest, I'd be willing to see what Oversea Fighters looks like. That'd probably be a better buy versus Blades and Angels.

170
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,640
angels but I don't know it's an easy game I guess so that's pretty much all I

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,560
played this week that and granted that a liberty city stories still they'll be

172
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,800
playing that game until the next one comes out all right and each week we

173
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,720
find more and more wrong with the multiplayer which we'll get into later

174
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,480
all right my gaming week let's see I oh actually I want to go chat real quick

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,080
before we go to my gaming week I want to point out Ari Masan is talking about the

176
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,960
LocoRoco English demo which apparently is available at psp.playstation.com you can

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,160
browse around your PSP and you can get the demo for the English version of LocoRoco.

178
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,080
Yeah we couldn't get that to work so we just got the Japanese one off the

179
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,920
website. But that's good news for people like me if I can get it to work so who

180
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,120
can't who doesn't understand you remember a lick of Japanese. Let's see

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,560
something. There are detailed instructions for downloading on my live journal. Yeah

182
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
but not everybody not everybody that listens to show can read your live

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,480
journal so. Nope not everybody is that privileged. All right we do have a live

184
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,160
journal community though it's a username orange lounge if you are a live journal

185
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,120
member and maybe if you ask really nicely on that community Jamie will

186
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,640
cross-post her instructions that would be cool all right

187
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm awesome also wants to point out he 100% at loco roko in nine minutes well

188
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,440
you big stud go you all right anyway my gaming week I also played way down the

189
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,080
the DS dance or I don't know it's it's gonna be elite beat agents here in the

190
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
And it's going to be a completely different game.

191
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
Yeah, because it's very Japanese.

192
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,080
They're completely redoing the whole story,

193
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
redoing the characters in it.

194
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,080
There's these guys in suits and not the male cheer squad.

195
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,080
They're going to have to because it's all the text, all the music.

196
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
It's not that they're going to have to, it's that they are.

197
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Everything is being changed.

198
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I was saying, because if they had to translate it all anyway,

199
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
they're going to have to build it from the ground up practically

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,480
up practically because it's so very, you know, Japanese.

201
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,320
It's like you've got the Office Lady stage and you have the, you know, they, no, it's

202
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,080
actually pretty much, it's pretty much considered a sequel.

203
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Right.

204
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,520
Just released out over here.

205
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Interesting.

206
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,240
I, I, I have only really like seen the game kinda, like I think I saw it for like two

207
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,220
minutes at E3, so I didn't really get a chance to really figure out what it's all about,

208
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
but it's actually kind of fun.

209
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,320
For those who haven't played it, it's, it's a music game, and it plays music in the background

210
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,400
and you tap on the DS screen certain places sort of in beat with the music

211
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,880
depending on what the lyrics are but sometimes you trace, right like almost

212
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,120
like in Guitar Man. Have you played the one song there was one song where you

213
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,400
draw a heart you trace a heart it's so cute it's like a love song. I only played up to the second stage.

214
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,160
Listening to two musics going on at the same time just gave me a headache. I was

215
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,680
playing on Miklata's DS because and he has them all unlocked because he's been

216
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,220
playing that game like crazy and he told me to play this stage because there was

217
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,240
a heart that you draw at the end I thought that was really cute so it's it's

218
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,140
It's a very simple game, but it's hard.

219
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
It's a heart.

220
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,260
It judges very harshly.

221
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,500
You have to be good or it's going to penalize you big time.

222
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,860
So it was a lot of fun.

223
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,980
I'm actually thinking about importing it if it is going to be a whole lot different from

224
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
the English one.

225
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,680
It would make it worth it.

226
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
So we'll see.

227
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,180
I also don't like paying that much to import games, but that one's a really good one.

228
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
It's fun.

229
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,540
You know, because I like music games, obviously, as we all do.

230
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,820
Orange Launch kind of started as a music game station exclusively.

231
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,480
So obviously I have a big love for that.

232
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,100
So I want to check that out.

233
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,740
Also, since I was playing that, I was actually playing it on Miklotov's DS Lite, so I got

234
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,940
to put my hands on a DS Lite, and, oh my gosh, screens are so bright on those.

235
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
They didn't lie.

236
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
They're a lot nicer.

237
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,140
They're a lot brighter, a lot crisper, a lot cleaner, and the stylus, I noticed, was a

238
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,180
lot thicker, it was a lot more kind of sturdy, I mean, I'm sure you're going to lose it just

239
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,900
as easy, but it fit a lot better in the hand.

240
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,140
The only complaint I have about it is the sound isn't as powerful, and that's probably

241
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,820
because of the fact that you're putting it in a smaller box, it's not capable of producing

242
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,320
quite the large volume with no headphones, but otherwise it's a great system, but I'm

243
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,720
not going to buy one right now, because I'm not going to be a sucker to Nintendo's...

244
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,780
they always do this, they'll put out new colors, and then I say, oh I want one in the new colors,

245
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,660
so I'm holding out for the new colors, is what I'm doing, so maybe I'll get a DS Lite

246
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,100
at that point, but for now I'll stick with my DS Fat, thank you very much.

247
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,420
And then also my gaming week has been a hell of a lot of World of Warcraft.

248
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,940
Just playing the crap out of World of Warcraft.

249
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,060
They actually launched a bunch of new servers on Saturday.

250
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,940
And I kind of like starting on a new server because, I don't know, there's something kind

251
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,760
of fun about the fact that there's no uber powerful people.

252
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,060
And even though the noob areas are really crowded, you know, everybody's trying to work

253
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,980
together for a common goal and it's really easy to find parties for some of the noob

254
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,900
quests because everybody's trying to be like the first to be level 60.

255
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,940
So that was kind of fun.

256
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,220
And I played hardcore, I mean that server went up, I think Saturday at noon, or maybe

257
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,120
it was Friday at noon, I'm not sure, and I'm already level 13, which I'm sure some people

258
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,760
are like, oh that's nothing, I can get from 0 to 10 in an hour, but you know, I'm not

259
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,580
a hardcore World of Warcraft player, so for me, getting to level 13 in the course of a

260
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,280
weekend took a lot of playing, so I'm quite proud of that accomplishment and saddened

261
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
at the same time.

262
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,320
But I'm having fun on the new server, I'm playing a mage, and mages are a heck of a

263
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,960
lot of fun. Otherwise that's pretty much it. A little Burnout Revenge here and

264
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,800
there. A little other 360 miscellaneous arcade games but not a lot of new stuff

265
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,120
otherwise. Going over to the chat room www.orangeloungeradio.com click on

266
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,700
chat. Let's see, Tweak thinks the DS Lite is too small. Tweak says the DS Lite is

267
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,960
too small. It is, you know, it feels a little different in the hands but I

268
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,280
I was reading complaints online about the DS Lite kind of felt different, it didn't

269
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,680
feel right because it was too small.

270
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,320
I didn't notice it, it felt fine to me, but maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.

271
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,520
I know she's saying that I went through about two black ones until I found out about the

272
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,360
white PSP, so kind of going back to the whole colors and releasing new systems and all that

273
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
stuff.

274
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,720
Alright, anyway, let's get into gaming news for the week, and we'll start it off tonight

275
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
with Loki.

276
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,220
Loki has some politically-oriented gaming news tonight.

277
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,700
Yeah, of course, another week, another state signed in, another violent games bill.

278
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:17,920
This time it's Oklahoma, and Governor Brad Henry basically signed that in, and of course,

279
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,260
this one actually not really fining the kids who are buying the games, but they basically

280
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:31,180
are forbidding that they can sell anything that is deemed harmful to minors to them,

281
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,340
you know, I'd pretty much restrict anything like M-rated or adult-rated, and this goes into the

282
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:43,020
effect November 1st. Of course, like everything else, the ESA has stepped in to sue them, so

283
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,980
you know, it's going to be interesting. But the governor's basic reasoning for signing this in was

284
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,940
he believed the violence in video games has grown to epic proportions. Some video games glorify

285
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,540
violence to a degree seldom seen in even the bloodiest movies now. I'm not sure if he's seen

286
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,600
hostile yet, but I think that's a lot worse than some of the games I've played.

287
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,780
Anyways, continues on, while parents have the ultimate responsibility for what their

288
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:16,000
children do and see this legislation is another tool to ensure that our young people are not

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,440
saturated in violence, this gives parents the power to more closely regulate the games

290
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
their children play.

291
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,280
No, actually, this doesn't do anything.

292
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,280
All this does is do what people are doing already and the parents are going to buy their

293
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,720
games for them and then they're gonna go I didn't know I didn't know that on the

294
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,480
back of the box when it said violent content there is violent content in the game I

295
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,840
just thought they like seeing those words on there it's retarded and like

296
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,120
most of the times no matter how many laws and how easily explain this to

297
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,240
parents they don't care they're just gonna give it to their children to get

298
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,560
little Billy to stop whining and then when little Billy goes and murders their

299
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,040
neighbor then they'll go oh my god the games are horrible it's not because i didn't watch them and

300
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:10,880
bought him a gun or anything it's just because the games are ah it's just people need to take

301
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,600
responsibility for their children and the government thinks that they can help this out well

302
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,120
you know i think they should pass breeding laws instead

303
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,000
so the stupid people stop having children standardized testing

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,520
So, that's basically what's going on. Of course, I'm sure we'll hear more about how the ESA

305
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,880
is going to be suing them. And so far, in the last five lawsuits or whatever, they've

306
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,080
been deemed unconstitutional. So, you know, it's because they get those laws, you know,

307
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,760
that harmful minors, well, that's subjective. So, you know what? Who says who? What's harmful?

308
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,560
And you know, they haven't really proven that games are harmful to minors, so I don't know.

309
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,960
I just have to comment here, I love that the chat isn't saying a damn thing about the article

310
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
at all.

311
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,440
Instead, these are the type of comments we're getting in the chat room right now.

312
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,960
Let's see, YouWillBowToMe says, Loki's girl voice makes me laugh.

313
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,680
To which the best says, Is Loki a girl?

314
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,480
And WonderDogHerald says, I love Loki's fem parent voice.

315
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,520
And Bandit says, Let's pitch in to get him a training bra.

316
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm glad they're... I'm glad they're listening.

317
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,080
I know, I'm glad they hear the message in this about this horrible ignorant law.

318
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
Because I think a lot of parents are like this, you know, they're all

319
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,440
mmm, emirating, ooh, shiny! And then, you know, just let their kids buy it. I mean,

320
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,540
that's what it comes down to. Now, again, not

321
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,200
all parents, because we have intelligent parents that listen to this program. Yes, there are

322
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,620
intelligent parents out there.

323
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,960
By the way, I commend you all. Happy Father's Day to the gamer's dad,

324
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,760
gamer dad's listening tonight forgot to mention I didn't call mine

325
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,200
you still have a few more hours days not over yet

326
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,320
let me put it this way it's 8 something in Alabama right now

327
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,280
what's more violent simulating killing you know people

328
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,760
in a game and then granted the people are very you know

329
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,280
cartoonish or going outside

330
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,680
and going killing a deer playing hockey or playing hockey

331
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,800
Jaded2006, I think, hit the nail on the head here.

332
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,760
It's been repeating over and over again.

333
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,860
I think that's why the chat room is stopping to really refrain from commenting.

334
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,680
How many times have we heard this type of story, but in different states, where it's

335
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:32,320
just, you know, let's blame the games, let's put this law with vague, vague, vague language

336
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,440
as to what a violent video game really is, and, you know, blame it on them.

337
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,080
Meanwhile, you know, I just saw The Omen after last week's show.

338
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,760
I went and saw The Omen with a friend and it was pretty violent, I mean it's not the

339
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,240
most violent movie I've ever saw, but there's some pretty gruesome murder scenes in it.

340
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,080
And you know, top ten at the box office, no one bats an eye.

341
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,280
No motions to ban sales of The Omen.

342
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,360
I mean, everyone's like, oh you can beat up a hooker in Grand Theft Auto.

343
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,200
Okay, the only reason she's a hooker is because that's the skin that's on the character, okay?

344
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,280
Otherwise it's exactly a clone of all the other citizens in there, and to be honest

345
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,200
it's not that graphic I mean granted you can blow off heads on them but it's just

346
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,040
it's cartoonish looking it's just retarded it's not like a game that you

347
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,240
know shows you ripping apart people and all their organs just flying everywhere

348
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,680
and just you know that gruesome details but then again in movies they have that

349
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,880
all the time and you never hear anyone you know trying to eat somebody after

350
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,420
watching a zombie movie I don't know to which we get the chat comment

351
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:48,800
Xander K says Loki is a hooker I pit myself for the gaming world all right

352
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,280
let's go to another political story here it is same song different verse we

353
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,800
talked about it last week game politics calm ran the story here

354
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,600
Louisiana governor Kathleen babineau signed the video game bill that was

355
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,680
It was co-written by He Who Shall Not Be Named,

356
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,860
and it went into law.

357
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,760
This is the funny thing, it went into law immediately.

358
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,560
There was no January 1st date, November 1st, whatever date.

359
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,580
It went into law ASAP.

360
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,000
By the way, on a side note,

361
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
big congratulations to gamepolitics.com

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,460
because they're getting a mention

363
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,660
in Entertainment Weekly this week about like,

364
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,220
it's in the section like 100 websites

365
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,620
you should be visiting or something like that,

366
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,700
and they're in there, so.

367
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,420
And I agree, it is a website you should visit

368
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,960
if you're a gamer, so good job.

369
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,480
find it funny you know Louisiana is just rampant with you know basically bad

370
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,080
political decisions where it was you know moving the money for levee repair

371
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,320
to other things but we shout shall not comment on Louisiana's intelligence in

372
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,200
the political world mm-hmm so well don't know what else to say I mean that's not

373
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,720
really a big surprise but it did happen and it is law in Louisiana right now so

374
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Thank God I don't live in the South anymore. I'm sorry.

375
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,720
I mean, I feel... I liked growing up there, you know?

376
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,720
But I'm glad I got away from a lot of the backwards thought that goes on there.

377
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Alrighty. Speaking of backwards thought...

378
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Oh yeah, Jackie Poo.

379
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Yes, you have an article on He Who Shall Not Be Named.

380
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,720
On Mr. Jackass. That's what I'm going to call him from now on.

381
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Either Jackie Poo or Jackass.

382
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,140
So, uh, yeah, um, do you know that actually Jack Thompson is right on a few things?

383
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,500
You know what?

384
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,060
Entertainment there's there's a list up here. Actually. It's actually up on a pointless waste of time

385
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:42,860
And this is actually sent to us by one of our listeners whose email is hidden somewhere. I'm sorry

386
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,700
For you are leave it to a site called pointless waste of time to find

387
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,020
you know truth in he who shall not be named I think that they're well I look

388
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,800
at it this way he's been twisting reality to suit his own purposes we can

389
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,660
completely just you know show where he is indeed right but also show where he

390
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,060
is wrong in his correctness interesting correctness would have been in quote

391
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,420
fingers by the way except this is radio so you can't see me being awesome so

392
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:18,120
what okay so yes entertainment can change your personality you know and I

393
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,720
love how it's you know listed here have you ever gotten sad at a movie or listen

394
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,640
to a song that invoked a certain emotional response you know have you

395
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,720
been completely unmoved by any form of art all right I would think like have

396
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,320
you ever seen a movie that you would might think changed your life in one way

397
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,440
or another or change your outlook there's even a point here where they're

398
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,600
saying you know actors and actresses saying you know that they want their

399
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,280
movie to raise awareness on an issue well you know so yeah in that case he is

400
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,980
right it can affect you know but then again you know video games are no

401
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,200
different than a movie then looking at a painting then looking then reading a

402
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,840
book I mean there's a book at Walmart called naked murder but no no one's

403
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:12,180
crying about that oh heaven forbid you know it's what about you know what about

404
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,900
watching um Hamlet how much murder is in freaking Hamlet how much incest is in

405
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Hamlet okay so yeah that that's completely refuted okay another point

406
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,060
cops have a right to complain well that's true if you're playing a game

407
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,060
where someone's going around killing cops if I were a police officer that

408
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,780
would make me a little I do that it's like the anti lawyer killing game a

409
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,660
lawyer we go huh or if it's like someone goes into a call center and kills

410
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,900
everybody I'd be like stay away from my cubicle you know so on that point of

411
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,300
view yeah they have a right to be upset you know wouldn't you be if someone we're

412
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:54,820
going around you know hacking off you know people who do what you do um sorry

413
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,840
just different songs from my childhood popped into my head suddenly can I

414
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,860
Can I interject a little chat room humor in here?

415
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
Sure.

416
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,600
Fireboma says, in response to, you know, emotional response to art, Fireboma says, you mean how

417
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,960
like certain music makes cowards cut themselves?

418
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Yeah.

419
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Emo.

420
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Yeah.

421
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:21,420
So, uh, now this is where he's wrong, is that, um, I mean, basically, there's not too many

422
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,360
games out there that really point that out.

423
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,680
I mean, you can, your games have a point.

424
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,480
You're supposed to accomplish certain goals in it.

425
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,940
You know, like Snipe's putting out in Grand Theft Auto, you have a choice to either go

426
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,200
out and commit all these crimes, or you can go through the game without doing any of that.

427
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,400
It's not probably as much fun, but you do have the option of not doing it.

428
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,060
I gotta play Devil's Advocate here for a minute.

429
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,880
What about a game like, cause I just was playing this earlier today, Burnout, where I'm encouraged

430
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,680
to slam into other cars and I get more points when I do so and that's really the only way

431
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
to win the game is to...

432
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,600
Are you gonna go out on the road and slam your car into it?

433
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,320
No, because I'm not a fucking idiot!

434
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,560
Okay, point taken.

435
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,280
But it's still a choice, right?

436
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
I guess.

437
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,800
In that one you're forced into that circumstance, but in real life you're not forced into doing

438
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
it.

439
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,360
If I wanted to drive my car through, you know, rush hour traffic the wrong way and slam into

440
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,640
everybody I could, I wouldn't need a video game to probably make me do that.

441
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,040
You know, something's wrong with me anyway.

442
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,560
need another x chromosome

443
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,520
another point was that games appeal to the worst

444
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,040
of the worst in us moving on

445
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,120
well more specifically teenage boys but you know

446
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,840
yeah they make profit from dead or alive and from other games that are going to

447
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,240
appeal to

448
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,200
your average young man you know

449
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,320
this is my favorite favorite point

450
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,520
this is where he's wrong and it's it's the chart from the u s department of

451
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,900
justice showing crimes going down since the early 90s in fact it's quite a

452
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,920
significant plummet in fact I'm gonna link the the image to the chat room so

453
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,040
they can look at this because I think that this is pretty pretty awesome it's

454
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,840
basically showing how I mean and it's a pretty severe drop it's crazy if you

455
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,600
look at it it's gone from over from the you know 40 50 million range I'm sorry

456
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:23,380
sorry 50,000 range to dropping down under the 20s so yeah Jack needs to get

457
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,020
his head out of his ass and live in the real world with the rest of us not every

458
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,220
game also has a message to it I mean pac-man isn't like you know

459
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,020
demonstration of you know drug abuse or anything like that it's just it's a game

460
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,940
you do stuff that's it I mean Grand Theft Auto is in a game about murdering

461
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,780
people to teach you about how to go out and be a successful killer it's a game

462
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,460
with the story that's it I mean sometimes games are just simple like that

463
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,260
stop trying to read way too into things that's why I think a lot of people have

464
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:01,020
you know problems doing it's just you know just enjoy a game for being a game

465
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,900
you know it's fiction because it's a goddamn game they don't look real until

466
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,420
we get to like Grand Theft Auto 6 or whatever you know maybe even for you

467
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:17,220
whenever the new game on PlayStation 4 or 5, whenever you get graphics that good.

468
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,660
But right now, they don't look anything realistic, I mean...

469
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,540
Well that was the next point I was coming up to, is that he was saying that basically

470
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:30,020
the games are, you know, teaching us in the future that, you know, we're gonna all grow

471
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:35,260
up in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone's handling guns and killing each other.

472
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,300
But it's also showing the progression of basically graphics.

473
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,820
have pixel girl then you have you know like dead or alive and then you have you

474
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,780
know in the future games are gonna look pretty freaking realistic you know and

475
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,820
there's already games now it's hard to tell the difference the holodeck you're

476
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,700
gonna have a holodeck peep there will not be any violence when the holodeck

477
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,940
comes around because everyone will be having sex in the holodeck that is

478
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,540
exactly what's gonna happen fuck the violence everyone's just gonna be

479
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:05,140
getting laid all the time all the friggin time I can continue with this

480
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,180
please yes now there's a book that's called teaching kids to kill that's

481
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,100
written by a military expert who says first-person shooter games are going to

482
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:22,540
basically desensitize kids to you know murder well tell me does a you know do

483
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,180
you learn how to clean your gun how to aim how to fire how to pull the trigger

484
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,060
proper gun maintenance how to actually hold the weapon do first-person shooters

485
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,500
actually teach you how to do that they will when NRA the game comes out in

486
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,740
August I could learn all that from a civil war reenactment you know you can

487
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,300
go to a freaking firing range have them show you how to do the gun and then

488
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,820
shoot it off at you know a bunch of targets why are they coming after like

489
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:57,420
live ammo area 51 you know or maximum enforce or whatever the hell was the last

490
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,580
point is that there are real murders linked to games you know they're saying

491
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,900
you know there was that kid who same said that Grand Theft Auto 3 made him

492
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,640
kill people and like one case I think in Japan where they were saying it so what

493
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,580
about this is the point that I like so what about all of the murders that

494
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,080
happened before the game came out did it make them do that too you know and I

495
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,860
think this is great okay they're saying with GTA 3 this is 7 million copies

496
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,860
worldwide and say that another million were pirated and just quoting off the

497
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,060
site here so that means that when you have all of those cases the number of

498
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,280
of murders actually blamed on Grand Theft Auto 3,

499
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,280
out of four million users, it would be.00003%.

500
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,600
Where's this article again for our listeners to check it out?

501
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,080
It's at pointlesswastetotime.com

502
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,760
slash games slash censorship dot HTML.

503
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,800
Read it, definitely read it.

504
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,120
This is like one of the single best articles

505
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,360
I've seen in a long time.

506
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,080
All right, awesome.

507
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,520
Loki, we're gonna go over to Loki

508
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,560
who has some news about a game that it can't,

509
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,200
there can't be anything wrong with this game.

510
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,520
Even the fundamentalist, the most crazy people I don't think could find anything wrong with

511
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
this game.

512
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Right, Loki?

513
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,080
I dropped a crate on somebody and Luminous made me do it and I killed somebody.

514
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
My bad.

515
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
My bad.

516
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Damn those games.

517
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,640
Anyways, there was an interview with Tetsuya Mizuguchi from Game Informer, actually, and

518
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,960
he was talking about kind of where he's taking this series and how Luminous 2 is going to

519
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,600
be different from Luminous 1.

520
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Really?

521
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,560
Because E3 didn't show any of that.

522
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,680
Okay, well this will explain it.

523
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Luminous 2 is going to have a more diverse soundtrack, otherwise it's exactly the same.

524
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,280
Aw, you just lost so many cool points.

525
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,200
You're going to love this though, it's going to get worse.

526
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,200
They're talking about Luminous Live a little bit and they were saying what content there

527
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,960
may be to download and stuff for it and obviously there's going to be lots of stuff, but one

528
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,120
the things that they were playing on doing is you download the game and you gotta pay

529
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:08,120
extra for multiplayer. You gotta buy the multiplayer. For the game. You have got to be kidding.

530
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:15,240
No I'm not. Where's this article? This is on Game Informer. Dot com. That bastard. So

531
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,000
um, isn't that wonderful? But um, you know what? A big hearty fuck you to these people

532
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,960
because seriously, they're crack dealers, this is what they're doing.

533
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,420
They put out the first game for a low price on the PSP, and now that we're all addicted,

534
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,720
we want more smack, they're going to start charging us out the ass for it, and I bet

535
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,480
you a multiplayer is not the only thing they're going to charge for, they're going to charge

536
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,680
for each additional song, you want any of the cool licensed songs, you're going to have

537
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
to pay for it.

538
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Jerks!

539
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,560
And I will pay for every single one because I'm sad and addicted.

540
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,180
I know, but they're going to say that it's going to have some pretty diverse music.

541
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,880
They're talking about being able to download individual songs including Madonna and stuff

542
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,540
and that you can actually customize which songs you have to groups like 70s, 80s, summer

543
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
holidays.

544
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
Gotta pay the royalties somehow.

545
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,880
Yeah, exactly.

546
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,700
And they're saying though that they're going to be probably having some exclusive music

547
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,400
for different regions and whatnot.

548
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,680
When I saw that about the multiplayer thing, that was really kind of disappointing, you

549
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,680
know?

550
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,400
So, I don't know.

551
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,740
I have to go to chat room because they're being really funny right now and our old buddy

552
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,200
Bobby Black Wolf's in there and he's saying, did you hear the story, and it's not in our

553
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,260
show world for tonight, but maybe you guys heard about all the DS lights that got stolen

554
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,620
in Hong Kong.

555
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,680
He says, well, Luminous, the crate stealers were influenced by Luminous, so ban Luminous

556
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,040
in Hong Kong.

557
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,600
That's it.

558
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,520
So here's exactly where it says right there.

559
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,640
This is the question.

560
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Game form.

561
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,600
Will you be able to play Luminous Live against other people online?

562
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,520
We are currently working on a versus mode.

563
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,120
Puzzle mode will be two players online.

564
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,600
Okay, so you can play two players, I guess.

565
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:12,040
If you do purchase a versus mode, every mode will have a price, but they won't be high

566
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
priced.

567
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,000
the basic package of luminous live and then you add versus mode to it so at

568
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,080
least there's a way at least that's the way we have it planned right now we're

569
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,880
still trying to determine a full package versus in with the basic package yeah

570
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:37,160
you better because that's really stupid if you don't I'm just upset I don't know

571
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,360
what else to say dark dark Sakura let's go over to I'm sorry was that it was

572
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,840
there more is it okay oh it might be coming to the PlayStation 3 and we

573
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,920
depending on how well those systems do big shocker there that's not a big shock

574
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,200
dark Sakura this is somewhat of a big shock I don't know I've never seen

575
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,520
anything like this before have you I've seen it not in this country basically

576
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,000
you know how in Japan you have vending machines for everything right from beer

577
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,320
vending machines to use panty vending machines to Sony's vending machines well

578
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,920
guess what they're experimenting with the vending machines outside of Japan

579
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:25,280
apparently they've got a test vending machines out now on a limited run and

580
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,700
they're going to be actually adding about seven more US locations at

581
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,520
airports and various places but they're also considering opening some of these

582
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:41,280
up in the UK too so I mean base basically the cards are supposed to be

583
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,380
they use debit and credit cards so where you put it in pick what you want pull it

584
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,000
out that charges your card so am I gonna be able to buy on these machines like

585
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,680
PSPs you can get PSPs digital cameras CD players games DVDs basically they're

586
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,940
calling them robotic stores UMDs maybe this is maybe this is Sony's way to

587
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,900
to finally abreast some life in UMDs.

588
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,420
No, they've got these, they're starting to put them in train stations and they're actually,

589
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
we sell to them our distribution company.

590
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,980
There's an iPod vending machine in the Metreon, why not Sony one?

591
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,820
I was going to say, that's probably where Sony got the idea for it.

592
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
Well...

593
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,820
Oh, they've already had it in Japan for a while.

594
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

595
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,100
Where Sony saw that it could be successful is because Apple's having big success with

596
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,340
their iPod vending machines and when I first heard about that, I think it was actually

597
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,860
when your buddy Tiara in Vegas was talking about there was an iPod vending machine at

598
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,820
Hilton there or something and I was like really that's like the only I put a

599
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,300
dollar for candy I can't imagine putting a hundred dollars in the vending machine

600
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,400
here's the only thing I guess the only thing I have a problem with and this

601
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,380
happens all the time I hate when you put dollar in the vending machine and your

602
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,100
chips get stuck what's gonna happen if I pay for a PSP and the fucking PSP gets

603
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,540
lodged in there I'm gonna be pissed I think they have I think they'd be like a

604
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,700
robotic arm something because they wouldn't want to drop right expensive

605
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,500
machinery down a little hole. There's got to be a weight trigger or something

606
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,700
because even the fancy food vending machines now have a weight trigger that

607
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,420
so when the food hits the bottom it knows that something hit it. But so far

608
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:16,380
the testing locations are in California, Georgia, and Colorado and I actually I

609
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,780
think that you can on Sony's side I think they might have a location listing

610
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,740
but I haven't had an opportunity to check that yet but I'm sure you can find

611
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:31,660
something on Sony's website probably gonna be like LA Atlanta Denver and if

612
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,980
you want to submit a picture of yourself kicking a Sony vending machine we'll put

613
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,940
it in our orange laundry not that we endorse it no don't actually make a

614
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,140
obscene gesture toward it or actually kick it but if you want to take a

615
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,300
picture of your foot up next to it you know like you're gonna kick it kick an

616
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,100
ultra kick yeah I'm gonna kick the ultra Kate a while back so now we'll do kick

617
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,260
the Sony vending machine I'll tell you what I'll tell you what the the top

618
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,260
photo will win something that I'll decide at a later date.

619
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,260
The Sony vending machine actually isn't a vending machine, it's actually the PlayStation 3 case.

620
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Let's keep it moving.

621
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Also, speaking of the PlayStation 3,

622
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,260
there was a pretty funny observation made this week

623
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,260
on the PlayStation 3, and it kind of dates back to E3, but

624
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,260
somebody was going through their E3 pictures, looking at the pictures of the Sony controller

625
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,460
for the PlayStation 3 and looked really closely and saw that something was wrong

626
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,300
with the select button on the controller on the prototype there. It didn't say

627
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,980
select and this is the controller that was in like the glass case next to the

628
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:38,720
PlayStation 3. It didn't say select, it said S-E-R-E-C-T. I heard that was a

629
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,860
Photoshop. You know it probably could have been but I'm gonna go ahead and

630
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,580
name it on the program because it's coming from various gaming blogs out

631
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,340
there so it's news it's a news floating around out there and the fact that

632
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,580
there's several pictures of it from different angles so if it is photoshop

633
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,460
they did a pretty darn good job so I don't know but that's the type of thing

634
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:03,940
I guess you'd expect to see on engrish.com or something a blatant error I

635
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:11,420
don't know is anybody asked Sony directly about this who knows that's

636
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,260
silly anyway I Loki how about the Wii controller the Wii controller according

637
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:24,900
to be a moto not gonna have a microphone he says it would be it would increase

638
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,460
the price of the console too much to justify the inclusion of microphone I

639
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,260
call bullshit though because I mean come on a microphone that small can't cost

640
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,860
anything I mean it's gonna be like a buck or two I mean really it's gonna

641
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,780
cost that much more and even still if they want to say that they're not gonna

642
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,020
put one on there there is a little fucking you know connection in the back

643
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:49,840
You can pop in a microphone right there. So I'm still saying why doesn't Nintendo just do the Nintendo thing?

644
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,580
And they have it in the got it later. They have a microphone in the DS

645
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:00,260
It didn't cause that you know portable system to be too expensive. I mean why don't they put the same microphone in there?

646
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:07,320
It works for that. It's obviously really small. I'm sure it's not costing like 50 bucks to add a microphone

647
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,080
It's a microphone. Aha. Aha all this talk about the DS and Wii connectivity

648
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,080
why couldn't you just use your DS as the microphone because that's it that's

649
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,360
gonna say that you need to have a DS in order to play certain games and they're

650
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,620
not gonna do that so and you could do that for some games I imagine but I

651
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,320
would say why not just they could easily add a microphone to this maybe it's a

652
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,680
space issue because I mean the controller is pretty small but

653
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,980
microphones nowadays in the small electronic devices they're damn tiny and

654
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,900
and I know they can't be too expensive, like a buck or two, really, and that's, you know,

655
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,220
going and buying the parts at Radio Shack, let alone what they get, you know, at cost,

656
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
so who knows?

657
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,140
Uh, you will bow to me and our chat room says they need a mic that registers blue without

658
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,260
saying brew, if you've played brain training.

659
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:04,860
That's voice recognition software, that has nothing to do with, you know, whatever.

660
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,860
Alright.

661
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:11,260
Uh, Loki, or I'm sorry, no not Loki, we just heard from Loki, Dark Sakura, uh, you have

662
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,060
a story about, kinda, we've been talking about PlayStation 3 and Wii, kinda have a story

663
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
about both.

664
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,640
I just might, and in fact, you know, uh, I think that we're not the only ones frustrated

665
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,460
with, uh, the PS3, you know?

666
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,380
I think a lot of developers are pretty, uh, pissed off about it too.

667
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,620
Um, actually a lot of developers are leaving the PS3 to start develop on the Wii, and,

668
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,660
uh, LucasArts is one of them.

669
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Um, there are, uh, actually some rumors that actually they were, uh, printed in the last, uh, EGM are saying that, uh,

670
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:49,660
you know, so far they're still in the rumor phase, but it seems a lot of the third-party developers are kinda pissed off at Sony and, uh,

671
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,660
have gone over to a system that they're gonna be able to sell more games on.

672
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:58,660
Um, the games are gonna cost more to develop for the PlayStation 3. It's not viable for them to do business on.

673
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:06,660
So, uh, a lot of areas are, you know, looking to move over, and they're saying that now LucasArts is one of them who's working on a Star Wars game for the Wii.

674
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:13,660
They want to take advantage of the controller and the sound, the speaker and the controller.

675
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,660
So basically, think of a lightsaber game.

676
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:22,660
If that pans out the way it describes there, that's gonna be bad news for Sony.

677
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,660
Sony shot themselves, I don't feel sorry for them at all.

678
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,660
Well, maybe they can win him back. What can they do to win him back? More first-party games.

679
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,660
How about, you know, make a system that isn't complete ass, focus on the games, not what they look like.

680
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,660
More twisted metal, more violent twisted metal. That would be the way to do it.

681
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,660
Guns, violence hookers, Loki. Lots of gun-violent hooker games.

682
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,660
And maybe, I don't know, put out Gran Turismo that's not a port of an older one. That might be a good start.

683
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:56,120
Alright, going back over to the Wii for a minute, you know, I gotta say, lots of cool

684
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,460
points on Nintendo, and this is just one more kind of to add to that.

685
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:07,400
Nintendo is showing controllers for the Wii behind closed doors that resemble pads from

686
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,300
the TurboGrafx-16, the Genesis, the NES, get this, they're saying that you can actually

687
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,620
plug these into your Wii controller and use these for the Virtual Console.

688
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,740
Now the problem is this story is a little bit different

689
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,500
the several times I've read about it this week.

690
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,100
Somebody on our forums actually posted a picture

691
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,360
of like all these things in a briefcase or something

692
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,540
saying that you would be able to plug in

693
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,860
your old controller.

694
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,640
So if you have old Super Nintendo controllers

695
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,100
sitting around the house just gathering dust,

696
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,780
you could plug these in, there's gonna be an adapter,

697
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,100
you can plug it into the Wii controller

698
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,060
and use them on the virtual console.

699
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,540
But now other stories I'm reading say that no,

700
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,060
they're making new ones that resemble the old controllers

701
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,860
so we kinda have a little bit of a disconnect there.

702
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,860
so this could all just be a bunch of crap.

703
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,360
Well third party can always come out and create something like that.

704
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,860
Exactly, see third party would probably create it anyway,

705
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,360
but if Nintendo's doing this themselves,

706
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,860
I love the adapter idea for Virtual Console,

707
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,860
but then you kind of think about,

708
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,860
okay well would I be able to use like a Super Nintendo controller on the NES games?

709
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,860
Well why not I guess, but you know Nintendo's gonna have to kind of think all that out,

710
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,360
and how weird is that gonna be to use like a Sega Genesis controller to play a Nintendo game?

711
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,860
How weird is that gonna be?

712
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:18,580
I don't know, maybe she's me, I don't know, I think it's kind of weird.

713
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:23,220
Dark Sakura going

714
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,380
into something, going into a virtual gaming system of a different type.

715
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,140
Well, guess what has finally happened?

716
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,020
What's that? We have seen Geometry Wars defeated

717
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,460
by Uno. Wait, wait, wait, whoa, like

718
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,140
like people playing it or what? The Xbox 360 version of

719
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,820
Uno is the highest daily demo-to-sale conversion of any Xbox Live arcade game.

720
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:56,500
Wow. It even topped Geometry Wars Retro Evolved. Wow. Yep. They, it's like not just

721
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:02,000
that, apparently it's given it the smackdown. Basically it's about a 40 to 55

722
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,260
cents profit, I think more per sale. Let me look a little bit further. But I mean

723
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,740
but basically they're they're sort of using that now. They can make other card

724
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,940
games and see if that tops no goody now we're gonna get a sea of card games that

725
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,060
are only gonna be mediocre Texas Hold'em's coming in July will you know

726
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,500
people be playing that whoopee there are a lot of poker things I won't be one of

727
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,660
them I think the poker thing is kind of a little overrated but you know what's

728
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:34,660
even gonna be worse when the Xbox Live vision comes out it's gonna like there

729
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,420
is gonna be so met much wrongness on those cams it's not even gonna be funny

730
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,740
I hope they're awesome. I hope they have a way to moderate it

731
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,340
So I hope you got do you know how many butts are gonna be seen on those cameras give me Xbox Live?

732
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:55,140
Prostitution you're gonna get strip, you know, you're gonna see eight lines stinging, you know, you know pedophiles on you know life. It's just

733
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,740
It's gonna be great for gaming. It's great publicity. All right

734
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,720
Of course and of course any story on Xbox Live brings the mandatory comment here

735
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,800
Did you know if it says I want Street Fighter on live? When will it come?

736
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,660
Did you like a Microsoft's little cocktease this week? They put up Street Fighter 2 themes and pictures user pictures

737
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,120
No game

738
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,500
So when you go into the art when you go into the Xbox Live and you go into like download new stuff

739
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,880
Street Fighter 2 comes up and you go like holy shit finally and then you go in there and it's

740
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,820
themes and gamer pictures for the low low price of a couple hundred gamer points and you're like son of a

741
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Funny I

742
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,060
Guess maybe they're just trying to build hype. I don't know

743
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,580
We'll see it'll be out when it's out. We don't know anymore. We're not gonna try and speculate anymore

744
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,640
Capcom can give a date and it'll be wrong

745
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,160
Moving on Loki you have a story about Grand Theft Auto 4

746
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,000
Yes

747
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,600
the rumor or

748
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,760
The rumor people are saying out there is that it's gonna be an MMO the reason

749
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,520
one of the reasons now that they're thinking that is because on the Rockstar Norse site they're looking for

750
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:10,160
for in-game animators, level design, motion editors, and network programmers.

751
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,600
And so they're thinking, ooh, network programmer, that must mean that they're going to make

752
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,720
it an MMO.

753
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,600
I hope the hell not.

754
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,160
Do you know how many people will play as the hooker?

755
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,840
Okay, listen, here's why this will never work.

756
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,420
One, Rockstar does not know how to program multiplayer to save their life.

757
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,840
It is awful when it comes to Grand Theft Auto.

758
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,440
I have not played, you know, table tennis, so I imagine table tennis is fine, but for

759
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,320
Grand Theft Auto, where we're concerned here, it is awful, awful, awful, awful.

760
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,920
There's so many glitches, so much wrong with the game, and I should know because I played

761
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,120
this thing twice a day, every day since the game came out on the PS3.

762
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,180
So awful.

763
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:55,640
But there's a lot to work on, and they definitely need people to be doing that, plus, I mean,

764
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,280
if you're going to be doing multiplayer in a game like that, it's probably going to be

765
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,340
lot more complex than, you know, Table Tennis was. I don't think this says anything about

766
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,220
it being an MMO, and I don't think that they would start off with an MMO. I don't know.

767
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,900
I don't think it's going to happen. Episodic content? Yes. MMO? No.

768
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,540
I've played Table Tennis online, and it's fine. It plays fluid. It's pretty solid.

769
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,260
Yeah. I wish they had the same people working on, you know, Liberty City stories on the

770
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,460
PSP. Well, I think you're... White City stories better be goddamn perfect.

771
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,580
think Grand Theft Auto 4 will be multiplayer in some capacity or another?

772
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:32,260
You know what, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't. I'd be, I wouldn't be surprised

773
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:37,180
if it was live aware, and that's it. Hmm. Because, you know, we thought the same thing

774
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:43,020
with Liberty City Stories on the PS2, and they tried, and they were unsuccessful to

775
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,440
get it working. So what makes you think they're going to be, I mean, maybe Xbox Live might

776
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,040
be a little bit easier in Playstation 3, but I'm not, I'm not going to be too surprised

777
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,500
if it doesn't have a multiplayer. I would hope, because that'd be awesome, but I don't

778
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,460
think it's gonna.

779
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,420
Comments on Grand Theft Auto Online. VidPala says, it'll turn into The Sims Online, which

780
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,300
you've probably heard us talk about on the show before. Just basically turn into Drugs

781
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:12,420
and Sex, Sims Online. You Will Bow to Me says, I want to play as the guy who works at the

782
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,860
chicken joint in a Grand Theft Auto MMO.

783
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:20,900
Well, the multiplayer in the PSP version, I like the modes that they have. If they worked

784
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:26,460
right it'd be great because you know eight man you know six man teams or

785
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,780
whatever have a perfect you know just doing a simple deathmatch like any other

786
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:36,540
game doesn't have to be a full-blown no MMO just make the modes work correctly

787
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,620
and then they'll be great all right well speaking of MMOs there's been another

788
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,780
rumor going around the internet this week about Blizzard MMOs and that

789
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,900
Blizzard is gonna turn into like this MMO only company and basically what

790
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:55,660
happened is that F13.net did some type of presentation to Wall Street and a rep from

791
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:02,780
Vivendi said, all Blizzard franchises will become MMOs, to which like Starcraft fans

792
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,220
and Diablo fans everywhere pooped their pants simultaneously when they heard this.

793
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,820
Loki, you think there could be any truth in this?

794
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:16,100
No, because Blizzard actually, when GameSpot questioned them about this whole rumor, they

795
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:24,180
said, alas for those yearning for a marathon World of Starcraft session Blizzard moved

796
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:32,620
quickly the quash rumors of any non World of Warcraft MMOs. No, that's just a rumor

797
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:38,340
in regards to Blizzard. And it says, we believe that rumors circulating about this subject

798
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:44,100
is based on a misinterpretation of information provided to industry analysts. And if I remember

799
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:49,500
correctly, um, they had slides that basically showed, you know, potential for these games

800
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:56,100
to grow in those areas, not necessarily guaranteeing that they will grow in there. So, I dunno.

801
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,340
I'm sure I'm gonna piss off some Blizzard fans by saying this, but I don't care, but

802
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,700
isn't World of Warcraft just Diablo MMO with Warcraft characters?

803
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,700
Pretty much, yeah.

804
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:09,300
I mean, you already have your Diablo MMO, I don't know what's wrong.

805
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,860
Warcraft maybe, I mean that might be kind of cool I guess, but it'd be pretty much the

806
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,860
same.

807
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,860
At least that's what I think.

808
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:23,220
Alright, Loki, now speaking of MMOs, we see these stories come up once in a while, but

809
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,660
they're banning more gold sellers, or what's going on?

810
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:32,300
They've suspended more than 250 accounts, and according to them, they...

811
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,360
Wait, is this World of Warcraft, or is this something else?

812
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,100
This is Final Fantasy XI.

813
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:48,100
I've suspended 250 accounts and have retrieved some 250 billion in gil that's been removed from circulation as a response to this.

814
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,100
That's a lot of gil.

815
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:58,100
But I don't believe that each one of those accounts had a billion gil. That's kind of ridiculous.

816
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,100
That's a lot of money.

817
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,100
But yay! Go them!

818
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,100
I don't play that game anymore.

819
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,260
so I know I I saw my account active but and I have

820
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,460
I think 12 days left in the month to decide if I want to keep it or not

821
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,900
I'm kinda I'm kinda leaning towards no. I'm going back to PSO

822
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,940
we'll see oh why that game is so old now

823
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,220
Julie's gonna pay for my account so I can play with her. Well if you're getting it for free I guess you can't go away

824
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,420
what about Phantasy Star Universe that's just around the corner

825
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,980
aren't you girls gonna upgrade? I'm playing World of Warcraft. You signed in and then signed right back out

826
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,700
I had stuff to do. Alright alright

827
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,980
Final Fantasy XI isn't the only game where this is happening.

828
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,340
It is happening in World of Warcraft as well.

829
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:46,340
Blizzard has banned more than 30,000 accounts during May alone for gold farming.

830
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,820
In keeping with Blizzard's aggressive stance against cheating in World of Warcraft, we

831
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,980
banned over 30,000 accounts in the month of May and with that removed over 30 million

832
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,780
gold from the economy across all realms.

833
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,560
The banned accounts were taking part in activities that violate the game's terms of use, including

834
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,000
using third-party programs to farm gold and items, which severely impacts the economy

835
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,760
of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.

836
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:16,200
So it looks like there's steps going on in a lot of the big MMOs to boot the gold farmers.

837
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,200
Kind of interesting.

838
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,920
But what's also interesting about that, let's see, if we take 30 million and divide that

839
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:28,720
by 30,000, that's 1,000 gold a person about that was taken out of the economy.

840
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,960
I don't know. I know a lot of people who are really really addicted to World of Warcraft at their level 60s that a thousand

841
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,320
gold is

842
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:42,420
attainable for the normal player, you know, what's funny about all of this, you know, everyone's

843
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,800
Always saying, you know this gold farming 20

844
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:52,920
It hasn't really had any effect on the prices of gold and I remember every now and then just out of curiosity

845
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,920
I'll go and look over at IGE to see how much they're selling

846
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,880
selling gold for and stuff and the prices just keep dropping and dropping and dropping

847
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,880
and dropping.

848
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,040
I'm not sure if that's because they can't sell it anymore.

849
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,440
I would think because there's more out there, they would have to drop the prices.

850
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,040
Well, what's interesting too about World of Warcraft is there's so many realms.

851
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,460
There's so many realms now.

852
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,460
It's got to be hard.

853
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,460
They added more.

854
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,740
Right, because they added the new one I just started on, Aeri Peak is the one I'm playing

855
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:25,560
on now, that just opened up over the weekend and with all these servers opening up, these

856
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,960
companies can't possibly be staying on top of it fast enough to get all the

857
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:38,140
gold. 2 million for 30 bucks. 2 million Gil. Wow. 30 bucks. Crazy. Alrighty let's go on

858
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:42,960
over to Dark Sakura because she likes to surf the internet up and down and back

859
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,200
and forth and sideways and every which way. I have no life. To find a website that

860
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,200
speaks to her that she wants to share with all of you. It's Dark Sakura's

861
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,860
website of the week and Dark Sakura where should all the kids be pointing

866
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,100
Weebl and Bob episodes that had that stuck in my head but anyway that's not

867
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,760
my side of the week that was an old side of the week still awesome site though

868
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,240
the site of the week this time around is eskadub.uncreativity.com the

869
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:39,280
catastrophe of eskaflowne which is fabulous but the specific specific thing

870
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,480
on here is if you go into their downloads page click on Sephiroth sexy

871
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:52,600

872
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,180
eric's death o vision it it's it's a hilarious video so well done and I guess

873
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,120
it's what there's a couple cosplay it looks like they filmed it in an anime

874
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,940
convention I have no idea where the squall cosplay yeah you can clearly see

875
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,380
a squall play and they're singing the one-wing angel but it's sexy Roth and

876
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:14,380
he's got a sexy ass. But the death of vision is the best part.

877
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,380
The heiress death of vision is great. My favorite line, way to stand there cloud.

878
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:24,380
While the choir is singing, just so you guys know, because this is radio so it's hard for us to explain,

879
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:30,380
but they play that death scene from Final Fantasy 7 over and over again.

880
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,380
Well, we want people to go to the site. I don't want to get into copyright things.

881
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:39,300
Yeah, but they play that they loop that sequence from Final Fantasy 7 where Eris dies over and over again

882
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:44,940
And then like put different filters on it like black and white and then trippy color and sepia and all this stuff

883
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,940
This is crazy

884
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,700
That's great

885
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,700
genius pure genius

886
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:56,260
Congratulations kids. That's like that's my side of the week. I approve of Dark Sakura side of the week. So again the site is

887
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:04,220
E-S-C-A-D-U-B, eskadub.uncreativity.com. Go click on downloads. You will not regret it.

888
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:08,320
It will make you fall out of your chair. Do not be drinking Mountain Dew when you watch

889
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,940
this, or it will end up on your monitor. Does it say that on the site? No. Oh, okay. Oh,

890
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:18,360
that's what happened to you? A friendly warning. Oh. I don't know how I would come up with

891
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,620
that. Alright. Other than I snorted Mountain Dew out of my nose. You're welcome, because

892
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:27,260
I gave that link to Jamie to begin with. I hate you. But not really, I lied. Hopefully

893
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:33,540
you had some Windex. Um, Loki, let's talk Guitar Hero. Boy, talk about this game never

894
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:40,140
calms down. People just love their Guitar Hero. Exactly, and if you love the Guitar

895
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:45,540
Hero game, you're gonna love the Guitar Hero 3rd party controller being put out by, it

896
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:50,300
looks sang, and it's called the Shredder. It looks very similar to normal Guitar Hero

897
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:56,940
guitar except um a little bit more metal i would say the shredder yeah it looks pretty neat i don't

898
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:03,340
know what do you think um jamie they had it on uh it looks like it's trying to be a really deformed

899
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:09,100
uh gibson thunderbird i want to smash it on stage i'm sorry the shredder makes me think of

900
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:15,340
teenage ninja turtles you know maybe all that hardware is for making coleslaw perhaps um

901
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:23,300
It is quite steep though in price, $48.90 is what the exchange rate ends up being, so

902
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:28,740
a lot of price for aesthetics.

903
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:33,300
I would like to point out it took about 3 seconds for somebody in the chat room, Brak2000,

904
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,860
to come up with the punchline.

905
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,980
What will they come up with next?

906
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:36,980
The Krag?

907
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,980
I'm sorry, the Krang?

908
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,900
The Krag is a different show.

909
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:47,360
they do a drum game then they'll come out with like the foot oh god that was

910
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:58,720
oh my god oh god boo get off the show get off ah all right um actually a quote

911
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,520
from someone who can't get into the chat room um to the shredder I say tonight we

912
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,360
dine on turtle soup anything else on the show is that was from tiara by the way

913
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:17,160
anything else on the shredder Loki it looks stupid yeah you know I played my

914
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,360
game like twice and it's it's in collects dust in my corner you know

915
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,260
what's funny about guitar hero it's a game I play a lot at other people's

916
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:30,560
houses and places I never play it here ever I don't touch it here ever I play

917
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,800
it at everybody else's house all the time it's weird it's like the other

918
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:41,440
people's game I don't know Dark Sakura while you were surfing the internet you

919
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,280
like to pay attention to what's going on overseas sometimes because it's not just

920
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,440
all about us here in America but we want to keep our UK buddies in mind as well I

921
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,040
love our UK buddies and our UK buddies have some new games coming out don't they

926
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,980
be repeating next week but there's also a Def Jam Fight for New York and the New

927
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:27,800
Super Mario Brothers so that's exciting. New Super Mario Brothers is pretty darn

928
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,880
cool I think glad you guys are getting it yeah magic kind of wore off after a

929
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,640
few days I don't know I don't Mario it's it's a good game and all but I don't

930
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,760
know just kind of Mario is honest yeah I'm more excited about the GameCube with

931
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,000
a paper mark super paper Mario that looks hot Mario it's hot I noticed

932
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,360
something today on my new shiny DS light screen yes well with the increase in

933
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,440
brightness and resolution on it I noticed that if you have the arcade

934
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,680
machine in your house in Animal Crossing, it's Mario versus Luigi on a fighting game.

935
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,520
That is a hell of a lot of detail to notice. Good job. You have no life.

936
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,560
You know what? Hi.

937
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,000
What's coming out for our friends here stateside, Loki?

938
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,480
Whole lot of nothing. Unless you like NFL Head Coach, in which case that's coming out

939
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,280
on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

940
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,480
There's some folks that are into that. We may not talk a lot about sports games, but

941
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,480
there you go.

942
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,960
I'm not knocking sports games. This is a sports strategy game. You don't get to play the team to get the coach to them

943
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,160
Oh, it's that's even like some sports fans won't even touch this. Never mind. But anyways, um

944
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:43,140
Although there is motor GP for which is coming out on PlayStation 2 two more your legends finally making it to PSP and

945
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:49,980
Legend of Heroes to the prophecy of the moonlight which also coming to the PSP and for your DS fans

946
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:57,340
Sudoku Mania yay and Break Em All is gonna be coming out and those are pretty

947
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:01,620
lame. Next week's gonna be some good stuff though. I'm gonna have to get one

948
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:05,060
of the games that's coming out even though I don't have an Xbox to play it on.

949
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:11,160
What's that? Krusty demons freestyle motocross. Well I've never heard of this.

950
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:21,160
Okay, this game is like a cross between Tony Hawk, an off-road game, and Flat Out.

951
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,160
Basically, it's like PMX, Triple X with motorcycles, is what it's like.

952
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,160
It's fantastic.

953
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,160
You get points for, you know, injuring your rider and it's just really cheeseball.

954
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,160
Alright, I'll tell you what, Logie, since I need to hang on to Oblivion a little while longer,

955
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,160
I'll let you borrow the big green brick if you want to have an Xbox for a little while.

956
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
I have my big green brick outside.

957
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,160
Well, I have to pick up the game first, so I'll bring it over and if it, you know, we'll see.

958
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,160
Alright. Sounds fair.

959
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:59,160
Dark Sakura, we were on UK just a second ago and there's actually a story that kind of affects them that you had.

960
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,160
Quite right.

961
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:06,640
Actually, I can never pronounce this right, if it's Gamasutra, I would assume Gamasutra

962
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,380
given Kamasutra, but anyway, a series of...

963
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,480
We like it better that way because it's sexier.

964
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,480
It's so hot.

965
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,000
I mean, just special places, anyway.

966
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,480
The video store game, a big retailer in the UK, is going to be changing its return policy

967
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,760
for software.

968
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,600
Right now, basically, a customer can return a game within 10 days as long as the packaging

969
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:39,680
is complete, but regardless of whether it's been opened or used, now it's going to have

970
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:46,920
its own seal on the packaging, and if that seal is broken, you will not be able to return

971
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,280
it if it's broken within, I believe, 28 days.

972
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,280
Hmm.

973
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,680
I'm trying to see if there's a date on there.

974
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,680
Okay.

975
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,240
basically I don't see the date when it's actually supposed to be rolling into

976
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:08,240
effect so I suppose it's already going into effect there's 700 own and

977
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:16,320
franchise stores in Europe there's a 23 in the UK alone 81 in continental Europe

978
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:22,800
and basically a lot of this is enacted because a lot of their profits went from

979
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,240
20 million pounds to 8.4 million.

980
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,560
That's basically in the series of 12 months

981
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,720
that ended at the end of January this year.

982
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,440
So basically they're enacting this,

983
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,120
I'm pretty much guessing to save their financial butt.

984
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,600
All right, hmm.

985
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,480
I'm looking at our chat room here

986
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,320
and looking at comments to some of the recent things

987
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,160
we've been talking about.

988
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,160
It's orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat

989
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,760
if you wanna join in the fun.

990
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,200
Black Wolf wants to point out,

991
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,040
There is a huge following of management sims, because we were kind of joking about a little

992
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,040
bit ago.

993
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,120
One of the top games in Europe is a soccer management sim, but that doesn't surprise

994
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,280
me at all because people are frickin' nuts about their soccer.

995
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,320
Maybe not so much here, like it's really weird.

996
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:10,300
Here we're not so crazy about soccer, but those that are soccer fans are like really

997
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,920
crazy about their soccer.

998
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,740
You know, and worldwide people are just nuts, so that doesn't come as a surprise so much

999
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,740
to me.

1000
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:21,220
And of course, for you folks overseas, you call it football, we call it soccer, and I

1001
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,220
don't know why, but we do.

1002
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,220
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

1003
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,180
Football makes perfect sense.

1004
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,180
Soccer...

1005
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,900
What do you do?

1006
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,500
Soccer sounds like an abuse.

1007
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,540
Bandit would like to clarify, when I was offering to let you borrow the big green brick, is

1008
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:36,940
that an Xbox Halo edition?

1009
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,940
Yes, it is.

1010
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:38,940
That's when I finally caved and bought an Xbox.

1011
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:43,820
That's the one I have, too, when my old Xbox died.

1012
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,900
For quite a long time I would not get an Xbox, I thought they were crap.

1013
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,140
I was, you know, of that school of thought where all the games that were on Xbox was

1014
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:57,060
nothing I was interested in, and then finally I caved right about the time the Halo Xbox

1015
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:00,300
had come out, and I thought, ooh, it's a pretty green one too, that's even better.

1016
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,820
So that's when I finally caved and bought it.

1017
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:11,760
Alright, let's keep it moving here, Loki has one more story for this segment, and Bricks

1018
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,160
may or may not be involved in this. Yes, Loki?

1019
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:22,200
That's correct. Uwe Boll challenges you. You, the bad reviewer. No, basically, Uwe Boll

1020
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:28,340
is put out a press release saying that he wants to fight the people that are criticizing

1021
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:34,460
his movie. His position, I am fed up. I am fed up with people slamming my films on the

1022
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:39,500
internet without seeing them. Actually, they do still suck even after you watch them. Many

1023
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:45,260
Many journalists make value judgments on my films based on the opinions of one or two

1024
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:56,100
thousand internet voices. Half of those opinions come from people who have never watched my

1025
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:03,420
films. I have been told that BloodRayne has a very bad IMDB rating, but how many of those

1026
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:09,460
votes of zero were made before the movie appeared in theaters? The criticisms go on and on.

1027
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:15,460
Okay, first off, they kind of have a pretty good system there where you can't vote until the movie comes out.

1028
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,460
So that's kind of invalid.

1029
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,460
And two, it's IMDB. Who gives a shit what your rating is on there?

1030
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,460
It's a completely subjective website. It has nothing to do with...

1031
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:29,460
It doesn't get published in a paper or something like that. Who cares?

1032
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,460
Well anyways, it goes on.

1033
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:36,940
So, it says, Ooey is now challenging the critics that have failed to watch his films prior

1034
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:40,380
to reviewing or commenting.

1035
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:49,060
To put up or shut up, towards the end of filming Postal, the five most outspoken critics will

1036
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,940
be flown into Vancouver and supplied with hotel rooms.

1037
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:58,100
As a guest of Ooey Bowl, they will be given the chance to be an extra slash stand-in in

1038
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:04,880
postal and have the opportunity to put on boxing gloves and enter a boxing ring to fight

1039
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,560
Ui Bull. Each critic will have the opportunity to bring down Ui in a five bout match. There

1040
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,760
will be five matches planned over the last two days of the movie. Certain scenes from

1041
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:21,400
these boxing matches will become part of Postal of the Movie and all five fights will be televised

1042
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,720
on the internet and will be covered by international press. To be eligible however, you have to

1043
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,260
to be a critic that has posted on the internet or written in a magazine or newspaper in the

1044
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:35,820
last or at least two extremely negative articles in the year 2005. Critics of 2006 will not

1045
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:41,440
be considered. Please submit proof of your negative reviews and comments via email to

1046
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:49,360
info.bull.kq.edu.

1047
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:54,700
So you're being rewarded for bashing Ooey Bull films by being in an Ooey Bull film?

1048
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,020
He's going to box you, but here's the thing that he forgot to mention.

1049
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,100
He used to be a boxer, so that's not exactly fair.

1050
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:06,820
By the way, you have to weigh between 140 and 190 pounds in order to do this.

1051
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,180
Because I was going to make you do this.

1052
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,300
For the sake of the show, I was going to have you do this.

1053
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,300
Okay, well here's the thing.

1054
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,500
I haven't written too bad reviews.

1055
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,620
We could do the magic of television.

1056
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:17,620
We can make it happen.

1057
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,620
We can make it happen.

1058
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,140
But you're too fat.

1059
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:25,420
I could lose the waiting time.

1060
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,220
I can't do it either.

1061
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,700
You want to do it?

1062
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,980
You know what?

1063
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:34,220
I bet having a chick put her application in there, I bet that would be, you want to do

1064
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,220
it?

1065
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:38,340
For the sake of the show, you want to fight him?

1066
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,340
She's grinning.

1067
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:44,620
I'll do it and I'll watch his movies so I can be critical of them.

1068
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,540
I wasted those four hours.

1069
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,080
I want you two to figure it out.

1070
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,960
one of you two is gonna put in the application because I can't I'm too fat

1071
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:59,000
to fight him but to be perfectly honest I actually I'll do it chronic fatigue be

1072
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,820
damned kick his ass I'll do it and we'll try to do it I guess okay and I guess

1073
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:08,800
I'll have to learn the box in the meantime because yeah actually I one of

1074
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,540
my old fitness classes I was in was actual boxing with a bag you know the

1075
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:19,780
boxing training and boot camp training that was fun

1076
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,020
it looks like our chat room approves so we'll see so we're gonna see what we can

1077
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,620
do to put together an application. I'm supposed to be joining a gym next week

1078
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:36,220
maybe I can lose the weight then fatty thanks ass and on that note we're gonna

1079
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:38,820
go ahead and call it you know I'm just kidding I'm just giving you a hard time

1080
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:43,980
I tease because I love street fight not boxing. It should be you know full

1081
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,720
