00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:21,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, June 18th, 2006, Xbox 360 gets more backwards compatibility, but someone's pissed you still can't play Psychonauts.

2
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:26,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumors that Grand Theft Auto 4 will be an MMO, and could the PS3 end up in a vending machine?

3
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:37,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:41,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about...

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:42,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here to help you do that.

6
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:48,789
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, but we cannot forget the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also here every week.

7
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, what up?

8
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

9
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:51,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good.

10
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:52,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

11
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:56,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And also here every single week, say hello to the one and only Loki.

12
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:56,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

14
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:58,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

15
00:00:58,498 --> 00:00:58,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

16
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, here we are.

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It's episode number 187, so you know what that means.

18
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:05,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a murderous good time tonight on the show.

19
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:07,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a joke somewhere in there.

20
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:16,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and we're going to start right here, live on the air, as we participate in a co-host battle royale, of which I'll win, because I'm vicious.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would we do that?

22
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:20,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, because it'd be good ratings.

23
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:21,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to die.

24
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:23,294
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll fake it.

25
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:27,457
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who were listening live last week, we were talking about the Americanization of battle royale a little bit.

26
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:29,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if it was after the show or in the middle or something.

27
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:33,921
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about Americanization of battle royale, and that whole thought still makes me kind of sad.

28
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:34,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

29
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, they're not going to get it right.

30
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:37,224
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they're not going to get it right.

31
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:37,924
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

32
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:43,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely just makes me want to go crawl into the corner and cry for an hour.

33
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:45,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's a rumor.

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's a sick, sad rumor.

35
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:48,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a rumor.

36
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the rumor.

37
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:51,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Tumor.

38
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:53,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, also... Yeah, the movie will be a tumor.

39
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:57,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to our invisible fourth guest, but they're really there.

40
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:01,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our chat room over at www.orangelondradio.com.

41
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:02,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on chat.

42
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:03,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your guys' show, too.

43
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:06,258
[SPEAKER_04]: We love to put in your comments and everything.

44
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you what, we have some sick fans.

45
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was just talking to one before the show tonight.

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260
[SPEAKER_04]: We have somebody from the UK who's listening tonight.

47
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So say hello to DigiNova, listening for the first time.

48
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:15,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

49
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was somebody else in there that said they were listening for the first time tonight as well.

50
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:19,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was...

51
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:25,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Anoshi, and I apologize if I butchered that name, Anoshi, Anoshi, also listening for the first time tonight.

52
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:26,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Not from the UK, but still.

53
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:29,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to you guys for listening.

54
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:34,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, a big hello to everybody in there tonight, listening for the first time, the hundredth time, or whatever the case may be.

55
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about our gaming week.

56
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:39,824
[SPEAKER_04]: We always like to start off the show talking about the games we've been playing.

57
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,145
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, start us off.

58
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:45,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a number of things over the course of this week.

59
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:49,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my DS Lite after the show, and so I've been playing Animal Crossing again this week.

60
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:59,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've also been playing the, on the Japanese website, LocoRoco.jp, they have the demo for LocoRoco for PSP.

61
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:02,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been playing the hell out of that today.

62
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And Osu!

63
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:07,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Tatakai Oendan today, which is actually harder than I thought it would be.

64
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:09,366
[SPEAKER_07]: When's Krista coming to the show?

65
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:33,827
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I tried to get her to come tonight, but she had to drive back to Davis.

66
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,947
[SPEAKER_04]: When you two get together, it's comedy gold.

67
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:37,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need her on the show.

68
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe she'll come for the big four-year anniversary next week.

69
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having a fourth birthday party.

70
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:47,549
[SPEAKER_04]: We're celebrating our... We're celebrating our... That was great radio, by the way, when you held up your fingers.

71
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We're celebrating our entrance into preschool next week.

72
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:50,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be fun.

73
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

74
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to find people to come next week.

75
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,950
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's... Oh, yeah.

76
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back down because I was like, eh.

77
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to play I don't have the time to LFP I don't have the time for this today

78
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:35,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's better things to do with my time than to immerse myself into an MMO.

79
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:38,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you hear about my gaming week, but we'll get to that in a minute.

80
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict.

81
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:41,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict!

82
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:42,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

83
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:43,564
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

84
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:45,285
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that LocoRoco?

85
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,566
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crack.

86
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the music.

87
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:49,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on drugs.

88
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:58,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the website for LocoRoco a few weeks ago, because they have a mini version of the game all in Flash, and I thought the music was so adorable.

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cute.

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:08,106
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really cute, but it's really frustrating because I find myself trying to tilt the PSP upside down, trying to tilt the world and trying to get it to go.

91
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:13,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get up to the moon and it's like, no, you have to have twice as many pieces of your body as you have now.

92
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:14,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, crap.

93
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:15,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you fall down the little hole.

94
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,632
[SPEAKER_07]: When you split into multiple pieces, you fall down the hole and then something comes in and eats part of you.

95
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:22,714
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, no, you're not supposed to do that.

96
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:23,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Spit me out.

97
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,816
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that's it.

98
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:30,144
[SPEAKER_04]: That game reminds me of an old-ass Super Nintendo game called On the Ball.

99
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:31,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever play that?

100
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:40,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it whored the Mode 7, that's all you did was you spun the screen, so you can't really pick up your TV and turn it, so you know, you use the L and R buttons on the Super Nintendo controller.

101
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,786
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you do on LocoRoco.

102
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:42,386
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

103
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,327
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's funny, I was looking at the screen, I was like, LocoRoco.

104
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:55,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, yeah, it's all super Japanese, everything is in Japanese, so, but it's like really easy Japanese, so it's not like that hard to read it.

105
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:59,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's written in Katakana, so it's super easy.

106
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're like me and you don't understand a lick of Japanese no matter what.

107
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Katakana, Hiragana, I don't want to... You know the difference.

108
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:14,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's two, but that's just because after doing this show for four years and listening to you bitch about enough Japanese games, I picked up that.

109
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:15,708
[SPEAKER_07]: My job is done.

110
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:16,488
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

111
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:18,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

112
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty good.

113
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,071
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I play?

114
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of Jewel Quest and...

115
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:34,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually beat the game finally, but except the thing is you have to play through like six different difficulties, which is kind of lame, but I don't know.

116
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:38,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers.

117
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:43,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to be playing Point Blank DS, but a certain GameStop didn't have it in.

118
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Looked at me crazy when asked for it.

119
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:47,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Point Blank got a DS?

120
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:48,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Who'd want that game?

121
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:50,766
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds cool.

122
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:51,967
[SPEAKER_03]: It is cool.

123
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,218
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not cool.

124
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how you were talking about before in the distributor world how certain titles are broken down?

125
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you have your AA titles and your A titles.

126
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:05,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a AA title would be like, what, Grand Theft Auto or something really big, Halo.

127
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like your A titles, which are kind of big.

128
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,405
[SPEAKER_04]: and then like B title, C title.

129
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,588
[SPEAKER_04]: What, is Point Blank like an E title or something, apparently?

130
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:14,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it as a AAA title.

131
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:19,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long-running franchise and it would have been perfect for the DS, but apparently GameStop doesn't think that way.

132
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop's more concerned of Urban Chaos or Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.

133
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:29,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't play them on a DS, dumbass, and it's probably the only solid DS title coming out this week.

134
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:35,466
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, they're more concerned with, you know, ripping me off on turning in my DVDs now.

135
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:46,613
[SPEAKER_03]: by the way, they mostly, all their DVDs, they magically don't have in their system, therefore they have to give you the generic price, which is 75 cents, to which I told them to fuck off.

136
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:57,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, DVDs don't really sell, so that's... I know, our company buys them back from... Take them to a video clearance center or whatever.

137
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:58,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

138
00:07:58,757 --> 00:07:59,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's local.

139
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:00,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so far away.

140
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:02,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they sucked.

141
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,219
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they don't.

142
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,039
[SPEAKER_06]: They pay my bills.

143
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,191
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they don't.

144
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,071
[SPEAKER_06]: They pay my bills.

145
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:12,112
[SPEAKER_03]: They may pay your bills, but they don't carry point blank.

146
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:13,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Children, games.

147
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not driving all the way over there.

148
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, games.

149
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I played through Blazing Angels.

150
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:25,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to beat the game so I can sell it back because it sucks.

151
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:35,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they were trying to do with the art style in the game, but it's really annoying because when you're flying, there's this big dark black crap on the outside of the screen that's

152
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it's supposed to look like.

153
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:40,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because I'm blacking out because I'm flying?

154
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:42,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it supposed to be... What?

155
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:46,427
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I'm shooting at something, everything else gets dark on the outside and bright in the middle.

156
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:49,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I have a TV with bad contrast or something.

157
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:51,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just can't fix itself.

158
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,831
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the whole game plays like.

159
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:55,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't get that.

160
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:57,553
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is kind of retarded.

161
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:01,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully, least achievements, there's only seven of them.

162
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:04,357
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty easy.

163
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like beating the game a couple times.

164
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:10,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it for free, okay?

165
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:12,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to sell it back after we get all the achievements.

166
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that the only reason it sucks, the graphics?

167
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:16,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just not a fun game, or what?

168
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,695
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics and the fact that the camera is really annoying.

169
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:27,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And the camera, a lot of times, you can lock on different planes to see where they are, so you can select a target.

170
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:31,657
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem is, though, there's so many planes flying around, it's hard to target anything.

171
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:33,357
[SPEAKER_03]: And half the time, it targets the wrong thing.

172
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:34,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like Grand Theft Auto.

173
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:35,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It targets the wrong...

174
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Objects.

175
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:38,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's kind of annoying.

176
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,149
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the camera, the graphics are really annoying.

177
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it's okay.

178
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing some multiplayer on it, and that's kind of fun.

179
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's probably the only reason you'd want to get it, is just multiplayer.

180
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:55,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But, to be honest, I'd be willing to see what Over G Fighters looks like.

181
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That would probably be a better buy versus Blades of Angels, but I don't know.

182
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:01,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an easy game, I guess.

183
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:04,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's pretty much all I played this week.

184
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:16,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That and Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories Still Gonna be playing that game until the next one comes out Alright And each week we find more and more wrong with the multiplayer Which we'll get into later Alright

185
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:18,809
[SPEAKER_04]: My Gaming Week, let's see.

186
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, I want to go chat real quick before we go to My Gaming Week.

187
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:29,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to point out Ari Mawson is talking about the LocoRoco English demo, which apparently is available at psp.playstation.com.

188
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:34,194
[SPEAKER_04]: You can browse there on your PSP, and you can get the demo for the English version of LocoRoco.

189
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:37,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we couldn't get that to work, so we just got the Japanese one off the website.

190
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:39,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's good news for people like me if I can get it to work.

191
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So who doesn't understand, remember, a lick of Japanese.

192
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:44,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

193
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:46,919
[SPEAKER_07]: There are detailed instructions for downloading on my LiveJournal.

194
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:53,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but not everybody that listens to the show can read your LiveJournal, so... Nope, not everybody is that privileged.

195
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:53,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

196
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,264
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a LiveJournal community, though.

197
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:57,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a username, OrangeLounge, if you are a LiveJournal member.

198
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe if you ask really nicely on that community, Jamie will cross-post her instructions.

199
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.

200
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:04,472
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

201
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:08,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Ari Mawson also wants to point out he 100%ed LocoRoco in nine minutes.

202
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you big stud.

203
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:09,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Go you.

204
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:11,217
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

205
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, MyGamingWeek.

206
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I also played Oidan, the DS dance...

207
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:33,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's going to be elite beat agents here in the US And it's going to be a completely different game Yeah, because it's very Japanese They're completely redoing the whole story, redoing the characters in it There's like these guys in suits and not the male cheer squad

208
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:38,561
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have to because it's all the text, all the music.

209
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,182
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that they have to, it's that they are.

210
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:41,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is being changed.

211
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was saying like, because they're going to have to, if they had to translate it all anyway, I mean, they're going to have to build it from the ground up practically because it's so very, you know, Japanese.

212
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you've got the Office Lady stage and you have the...

213
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:00,753
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually pretty much considered a sequel, just released out over here.

214
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:01,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

215
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:12,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I have only really seen the game, I think I saw it for two minutes at E3, so I didn't really get a chance to really figure out what it's all about, but it's actually kind of fun.

216
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:22,949
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who haven't played it, it's a music game, and it plays music in the background, and you tap on the DS screen certain places, sort of in beat with the music, depending on what the lyrics are, but sometimes you trace.

217
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost like in Guitar Man.

218
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you played the one song, there was one song where you draw a heart, you trace a heart?

219
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:29,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cute because it's like a love song.

220
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:30,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I only played up to the second stage.

221
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Listening to two musics going on at the same time just gave me a headache.

222
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:42,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing on Miklatov's DS and he has them all unlocked because he's been playing that game like crazy and he told me to play this stage because there was a heart that you draw at the end.

223
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:43,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was really cute.

224
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very simple game but it's hard.

225
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:46,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a heart.

226
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It judges very harshly.

227
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,989
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be good or it's going to penalize you big time.

228
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:52,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a lot of fun.

229
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually thinking about importing it if it is going to be a whole lot different from the English one.

230
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:57,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It would make it worth it.

231
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

232
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,570
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:23,546
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a lot nicer.

234
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:26,147
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a lot brighter, a lot crisper, a lot cleaner.

235
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:29,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And the stylus, I noticed, was a lot thicker.

236
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot more kind of sturdy.

237
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:35,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure you're going to lose it just as easy, but it fit a lot better in the hand.

238
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,319
[SPEAKER_04]: The only complaint I have about it is the sound isn't as powerful, and that's probably because of the fact that you're putting it in a smaller box.

239
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:45,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not capable of producing quite the large volume with no headphones.

240
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,943
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, it's a great system.

241
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,565
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not going to buy one right now because I'm not going to be a sucker to Nintendo's... They always do this.

242
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:59,967
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll put out new colors and then I say, oh, I want one of the new colors.

243
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm holding out for the new colors is what I'm doing.

244
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I'll get a DS Lite at that point.

245
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,772
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, I'll stick with my DS Fat.

246
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:07,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

247
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:11,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also my gaming week has been a hell of a lot of World of Warcraft.

248
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:14,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Just playing the crap out of World of Warcraft.

249
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:17,960
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually launched a bunch of new servers on Saturday and

250
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:44,786
[SPEAKER_04]: and I kind of like starting on a new server because I don't know there's something kind of fun about the fact that there's no uber powerful people and even though the noob areas are really crowded you know everybody's trying to work together for a common goal and it's really easy to find parties for some of the noob quests because everybody's trying to be like the first to be level 60 so that was kind of fun and I played hardcore I mean that server went up I think Saturday at noon or maybe it was Friday at noon I'm not sure

251
00:14:45,757 --> 00:15:07,778
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm already level 13 which I'm sure some people are like oh that's nothing I can get from 0 to 10 in an hour but you know I'm not a hardcore World of Warcraft player so for me getting to level 13 in the course of a weekend took a lot of playing so I'm quite proud of that accomplishment and saddened at the same time but I'm having fun on the new server I'm playing a mage and mages are a heck of a lot of fun

252
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:10,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweek thinks the DS Lite is too small

253
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweek says the DS Lite is too small.

254
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, you know, it feels a little different in the hands, but I was reading complaints online about the DS Lite kind of felt different.

255
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't feel right because it was too small.

256
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:40,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't notice it.

257
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,366
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt fine to me, but maybe I'm just crazy.

258
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:43,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

259
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:55,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Anushi's saying that I went through about two black ones until I found out about the white PSP, so kind of going back to the whole colors and releasing new systems and all that stuff.

260
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,434
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

261
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming News for the Week

262
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

263
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,931
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

264
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:06,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, it continues on.

265
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,261
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, this doesn't do anything.

266
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:08,822
[SPEAKER_03]: All this does is...

267
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:32,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Do what people are doing already, and the parents are going to buy their games for them, and then they're going to go, I didn't know!

268
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:37,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that on the back of the box when it said violent content, then there's violent content in the game!

269
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:40,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought they'd seen those words on there!

270
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's retarded!

271
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:43,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time...

272
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:50,440
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how many laws and how easily explained this to parents, they don't care.

273
00:17:50,900 --> 00:18:00,807
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just gonna give it to their children to get little Billy to stop whining, and then when little Billy goes and murders their neighbor, then they'll go, Oh my god, the games are horrible!

274
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:12,895
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because I didn't watch them and bought him a gun or anything, it's just because the games are... It's just people need to take responsibility for their children, and the

275
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:15,404
[SPEAKER_03]: The government thinks that they can help us out.

276
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:19,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I think they should pass breeding laws instead.

277
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:22,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So the stupid people stop having children.

278
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:24,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Standardized testing.

279
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:28,028
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's basically what's going on.

280
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:32,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I'm sure we'll hear more about how the ESA is going to be suing them.

281
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And so far, in the last five lawsuits or whatever, they've been deemed unconstitutional.

282
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:41,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's because they get those laws, you know,

283
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That harmful of minors, well, that's subjective, so you know what?

284
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Who says what's harmful?

285
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:55,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And they haven't really proven that games are harmful of minors, so I don't know.

286
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:58,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to comment here.

287
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:02,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that the chat isn't saying a damn thing about the article at all.

288
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, these are the type of comments we're getting in the chat room right now.

289
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

290
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,836
[SPEAKER_04]: YouWillBowToMe says, Loki's girl voice makes me laugh.

291
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:11,938
[SPEAKER_04]: To which the best says, is Loki a girl?

292
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:15,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And WonderDogHerald says, I love Loki's femme parent voice.

293
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bandit says, let's pitch in to get him a training bra.

294
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:23,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they're listening.

295
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:28,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm glad they hear the message in this about this horrible, ignorant law.

296
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:32,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think a lot of parents are like this, you know, they're all, mmm, M rating, ooh, shiny!

297
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, just let their kids buy it.

298
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what it comes down to.

299
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:40,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, again, not all parents, because we have intelligent parents that listen to this program.

300
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there are intelligent parents out there.

301
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:48,526
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Happy Father's Day to the gamer dads listening tonight.

302
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:49,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Forgot to mention.

303
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:50,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't call mine.

304
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:52,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing hockey.

305
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:52,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing hockey.

306
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Jaded 2006 I think hit the nail on the head here.

307
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,711
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been repeating over and over again.

308
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's why the chat room is stopping to really refrain comment.

309
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:24,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how many times have we heard this type of story but in different states?

310
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it's just, you know, let's blame the games.

311
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:34,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put this law with vague, vague, vague language as to what a violent video game really is.

312
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, blame it on them.

313
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:40,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, you know, I just saw The Omen after last...

314
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:42,397
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

315
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:57,559
[SPEAKER_03]: All the fundamentalists.

316
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:22,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

317
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:25,109
[SPEAKER_03]: To which we get the chat comment, Xander K says, Loki is a hooker.

318
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,399
[SPEAKER_03]: GamePolitics.com Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineau He Who Shall Not Be Named

319
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:08,667
[SPEAKER_04]: and it went into law.

320
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:09,588
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the funny thing.

321
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:11,449
[SPEAKER_04]: It went into law immediately.

322
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,431
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no January 1st date, November 1st, whatever date.

323
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It went into law ASAP.

324
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:28,079
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, on a side note, big congratulations to GamePolitics.com because they're getting a mention in Entertainment Weekly this week about like, it's in the section like 100 websites you should be visiting or something like that and they're in there.

325
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree, it is a website you should visit if you're a gamer.

326
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:35,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I just find it funny, you know, Louisiana is just rampant with, you know,

327
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:43,487
[SPEAKER_07]: basically bad political decisions where it was, you know, moving the money for levy repair to other things.

328
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:48,129
[SPEAKER_07]: But we shall not comment on Louisiana's intelligence in the political world.

329
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So, wow.

330
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:52,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know what else to say.

331
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:59,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's not really a big surprise, but it did happen and it is law in Louisiana right now, so... Thank God I don't live in the South anymore.

332
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

333
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:03,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I feel... I liked growing up there, you know?

334
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:04,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

335
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad I got away from a lot of the backwards thought that goes on there.

336
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:10,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

337
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of backwards thought... Oh yeah, Jacky Poo.

338
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you have an article on He Who Shall Not Be Named.

339
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:17,638
[SPEAKER_07]: On Mr. Jackass.

340
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:19,940
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm going to call him from now on.

341
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Either Jacky Poo or Jackass.

342
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:21,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

343
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:23,864
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

344
00:23:24,324 --> 00:23:27,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know that actually Jack Thompson is right on a few things?

345
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:28,588
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

346
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:29,068
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

347
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:32,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Entertainment... There's a list up here, actually.

348
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:35,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Pointless Waste of Time

349
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're, well, I look at it this way.

350
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:57,123
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been twisting reality to suit his own purposes.

351
00:23:57,424 --> 00:24:03,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we can completely just, you know, show where he is indeed right, but also show where he is wrong in his correctness.

352
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:04,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

353
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:09,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Correctness would have been in quote fingers, by the way, except this is radio, so you can't see me being awesome.

354
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:11,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what?

355
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:12,394
[SPEAKER_04]: A thing.

356
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:12,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

357
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, entertainment can change your personality.

358
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:20,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I love how it's listed here.

359
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:25,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever gotten sad at a movie or listened to a song that evoked a certain emotional response?

360
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:30,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been completely unmoved by any form of art?

361
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:35,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think, like, have you ever seen a movie that you might think changed your life in one way or another?

362
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:37,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe changed your outlook?

363
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:43,215
[SPEAKER_07]: There's even a point here where they're saying, you know, actors and actresses saying, you know, that they want their movie to raise awareness on an issue.

364
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:47,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, so yeah, in that case, he is right.

365
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:58,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It can affect, you know, but then again, you know, video games are no different than a movie, than looking at a painting, than looking, than reading a book.

366
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:01,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a book at Walmart called Naked Murder.

367
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,194
[SPEAKER_07]: At Walmart?

368
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,315
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's crying about that.

369
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:09,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Heaven forbid.

370
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:14,660
[SPEAKER_07]: What about watching Hamlet?

371
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,801
[SPEAKER_07]: How much murder is in freaking Hamlet?

372
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:18,622
[SPEAKER_07]: How much incest is in Hamlet?

373
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:22,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's completely refuted.

374
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:23,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, another point.

375
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Cops have a right to complain.

376
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:26,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's true.

377
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:32,873
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're playing a game where someone's going around killing cops, if I were a police officer, that would make me a little, uh, I'd do that.

378
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:34,814
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the anti-lawyer killing game.

379
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:40,955
[SPEAKER_07]: A lawyer would go, uh, or if it's like someone goes into a call center and kills everybody, I'd be like, stay away from my cubicle.

380
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:46,257
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so on that point of view, yeah, they have a right to be upset.

381
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:51,358
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, wouldn't you be if someone were going around, you know, hacking off, you know, people who do what you do?

382
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:57,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, just different songs from my childhood popped into my head suddenly.

383
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I interject a little chat room humor in here?

384
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:00,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

385
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:08,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma says, in response to, you know, emotional response to art, Fireboma says, you mean how, like, certain music makes cowards cut themselves?

386
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:09,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

387
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:10,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Emo.

388
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:10,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

389
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:18,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So, now this is where he's wrong, is that, I mean, basically...

390
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,304
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not too many games out there that really point that out.

391
00:26:23,464 --> 00:26:29,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can, your games have a point.

392
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You're supposed to accomplish certain goals in it.

393
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:41,393
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like the sites putting out in Grand Theft Auto, you have a choice to either go out and commit all these crimes, or you can go through the game without doing any of that.

394
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:45,455
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not probably as much fun, but you do have the option of not doing it.

395
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:48,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta play Devil's Advocate here for a minute.

396
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:57,243
[SPEAKER_04]: What about a game like, because I just was playing this earlier today, Burnout, where I'm encouraged to slam into other cars and I get more points when I do so, and that's really the only way to win the game.

397
00:26:57,303 --> 00:26:59,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to go out on the road and slam your car?

398
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:00,907
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I'm not a fucking idiot.

399
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, point taken.

400
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:05,014
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still a choice, right?

401
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:05,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

402
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,776
[SPEAKER_07]: In that one, you're forced into that circumstance.

403
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,038
[SPEAKER_07]: But in real life, you're not forced into doing anything.

404
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:18,243
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wanted to drive my car through rush hour traffic the wrong way and slam into everybody I could, I wouldn't need a video game to probably make me do that.

405
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:20,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Something's wrong with me anyway.

406
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:22,266
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd need another X chromosome.

407
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:30,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Another point was that games appeal to the worst in us moving on.

408
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, more specifically, Teenage Boys.

409
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:41,809
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, yeah, they make profit from Dead or Alive and from other games that are going to appeal to your average young man, you know.

410
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:44,891
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is my favorite, favorite point.

411
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:48,054
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where he's wrong, and it's the chart from the U.S.

412
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:51,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Department of Justice showing crimes going down since the early 90s.

413
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:54,199
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it's quite a significant plummet.

414
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,380
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I'm going to...

415
00:27:56,368 --> 00:28:01,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Link the image to the chat room so they can look at this because I think that this is pretty awesome.

416
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:08,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically showing how, I mean, and it's a pretty severe drop.

417
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:09,196
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

418
00:28:09,697 --> 00:28:15,120
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at it, it's gone from over, from the, you know, 40, 50 million range.

419
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, sorry, 50,000 range to dropping down under the 20s.

420
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:25,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Jack needs to get his head out of his ass and live in the real world with the rest of us.

421
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every game also has a message to it.

422
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:35,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Pac-Man isn't like a demonstration of drug abuse or anything like that.

423
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,209
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a game.

424
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,790
[SPEAKER_03]: You do stuff.

425
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,370
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

426
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Grand Theft Auto isn't a game about murdering people to teach you about how to go out and be a successful killer.

427
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,832
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game with a story.

428
00:28:48,112 --> 00:28:48,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

429
00:28:49,412 --> 00:28:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sometimes games are just simple like that.

430
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:54,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop trying to read way too into things.

431
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,314
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I think a lot of people have

432
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

433
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:27,503
[SPEAKER_07]: The Holodeck

434
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:50,029
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

435
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:30,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, tell me, do you learn how to clean your gun, how to aim, how to fire, how to pull the trigger, proper gun maintenance, how to actually hold the weapon?

436
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Do first-person shooters actually teach you how to do that?

437
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:37,089
[SPEAKER_03]: They will when NRA The Game comes out in August.

438
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I could learn all that from a Civil War reenactment.

439
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:43,435
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go to a freaking firing range.

440
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:45,159
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

441
00:31:01,938 --> 00:31:09,966
[SPEAKER_07]: There was that kid who said that Grand Theft Auto 3 made him kill people in one case, I think, in Japan where they were saying it.

442
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:11,588
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the point that I like.

443
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:14,792
[SPEAKER_07]: What about all of the murders that happened before the game came out?

444
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:15,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it make them do that too?

445
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:17,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is great.

446
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:18,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

447
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:23,550
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying with GTA 3, they showed 7 million copies worldwide and say that another million were pirated.

448
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just quoting off the site here.

449
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:34,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means that when you have all of those cases, the number of murders actually blamed on Grand Theft Auto 3 out of 4 million users, that would be .00003%.

450
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:34,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

451
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:40,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's this article again?

452
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:45,692
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at pointlesswastetoftime.com slash games slash censorship dot html.

453
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:46,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Read it.

454
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:46,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely read it.

455
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,994
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like one of the single best articles I've seen in a long time.

456
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, awesome.

457
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:54,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we're going to go over to Loki, who has some news about a game.

458
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:58,176
[SPEAKER_04]: There can't be anything wrong with this game.

459
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:04,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the fundamentalist, the most crazy people, I don't think could find anything wrong with this game.

460
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:05,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Loki?

461
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I dropped a crate on somebody, and Luminous made me do it, and I killed somebody.

462
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:10,402
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

463
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:11,642
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:33,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Warpy!

465
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Warpy!

466
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,240
[SPEAKER_03]: for the game.

467
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:07,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You have got to be kidding me.

468
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:08,644
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not.

469
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:09,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is this article?

470
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:12,507
[SPEAKER_03]: This is on GameInformer.com.

471
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: That bastard.

472
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, isn't that wonderful?

473
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know what?

474
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:23,139
[SPEAKER_04]: A big hearty fuck you to these people, because seriously, do not, this is what they're, they're crack dealers.

475
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:23,939
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they're doing.

476
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:34,463
[SPEAKER_04]: They get, they put out the first game for a low price on the PSP, and, you know, now that we're all addicted, they're, we want more smack, they're gonna start charging us out the ass for it.

477
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:36,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bet you multiplayer's not the only thing they're gonna charge for.

478
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:41,265
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna charge for each additional song, you want any of the cool licensed songs, you're gonna have to pay for it.

479
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:43,423
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

480
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:06,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

481
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:13,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying, though, that they're going to be probably having some exclusive music for different regions and whatnot.

482
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:22,885
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just... When I saw that, though, about the multiplayer thing, that was really kind of disappointing, you know?

483
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

484
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:30,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go to chat room because they're being really funny right now.

485
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf's in there, and he's saying...

486
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:39,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear the story, and it's not in our show world for tonight, but maybe you guys heard about all the DS lights that got stolen in Hong Kong.

487
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:46,319
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, well, Luminous, the crate stealers were influenced by Luminous, so ban Luminous in Hong Kong.

488
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:47,240
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

489
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:50,282
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's exactly where it says right there.

490
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:55,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you be able to, this is the question, Game Informer, will you be able to play Luminous live against other people online?

491
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:58,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, we are currently working on a versus mode.

492
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:01,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle mode will be two players online.

493
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you can play two players, I guess.

494
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:12,121
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do purchase a Versus mode, every mode will have a price, but they won't be high priced.

495
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:19,865
[SPEAKER_03]: First, you purchase the basic package of Luminous Live, and then you add Versus mode to it.

496
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:23,926
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's the way we have it planned right now.

497
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:28,569
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still trying to determine if we'll package Versus in with the basic package.

498
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:31,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you better, because that's really stupid if you don't.

499
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:36,978
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

500
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:04,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you know how in Japan you have vending machines for everything, right?

501
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:11,311
[SPEAKER_07]: From beer vending machines to used panty vending machines to Sony's vending machines.

502
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:12,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess what?

503
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:16,553
[SPEAKER_07]: They're experimenting with the vending machines outside of Japan.

504
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:23,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they've got test vending machines out now on a limited run.

505
00:36:25,115 --> 00:36:28,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be actually adding about seven more U.S.

506
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:32,040
[SPEAKER_07]: locations at airports and various places.

507
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're also considering opening some of these up in the U.K.

508
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:35,602
[SPEAKER_07]: too.

509
00:36:36,683 --> 00:36:43,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, basically, the cards are supposed to be, they use debit and credit cards.

510
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So you put it in, pick what you want, pull it out, and it charges your card.

511
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:49,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So what am I going to be able to buy on these machines, like PSPs?

512
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:55,122
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get PSPs, digital cameras, CD players, games, DVDs.

513
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:58,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they're calling them robotic stores.

514
00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:58,783
[SPEAKER_04]: UMDs?

515
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:03,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this is Sony's way to finally breathe some life in UMDs.

516
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:03,685
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they've got these.

517
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:08,707
[SPEAKER_03]: They're starting to put them in train stations, and they're actually... We sell to them our distribution company.

518
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:10,267
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an iPod vending machine in the Metreon.

519
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:11,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not Sony one?

520
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, that's probably where Sony got the idea from.

521
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:15,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean... Oh, they've already had it in Japan for a while.

522
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:15,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

523
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:15,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

524
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:22,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Where Sony saw that it could be successful is because Apple's having big success with their iPod vending machines.

525
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:29,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I first heard about that, I think it was actually when your buddy Tiara in Vegas was talking about there was an iPod vending machine at the Hilton there or something.

526
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:31,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, really?

527
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:35,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a dollar for candy.

528
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:37,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine putting $100 in a vending machine.

529
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:40,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the only thing I have a problem with.

530
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:45,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate when you put a dollar in the vending machine and your chips get stuck.

531
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:50,104
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to happen if I pay for a PSP and the fucking PSP gets lodged in there?

532
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:52,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be pissed.

533
00:37:52,846 --> 00:37:54,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they'd be like a robotic arm.

534
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:59,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they wouldn't want to drop expensive machinery down a little hole.

535
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:02,533
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be a weight trigger or something.

536
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:05,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even the fancy food vending machines now have a weight trigger.

537
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the food hits the bottom, it knows that something hit it.

538
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,284
[SPEAKER_07]: But so far, the testing locations are in California, Georgia, and Colorado.

539
00:38:14,985 --> 00:38:22,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually, I think that you can, on Sony's site, I think they might have a location listing, but I haven't had an opportunity to check that yet.

540
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,354
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure you can find something on Sony's website.

541
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:29,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably going to be like LA, Atlanta, Denver.

542
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:29,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver.

543
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:35,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to submit a picture of yourself kicking a Sony vending machine, we'll put it in our orange laundry.

544
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:36,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that we endorse it.

545
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:37,141
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

546
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:38,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't actually kick it.

547
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:40,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, make an obscene gesture toward it.

548
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't actually kick it.

549
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:44,744
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to take a picture of your foot up next to it, you know, like you're going to kick it.

550
00:38:44,764 --> 00:38:45,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we've had kick an Ultra K, remember?

551
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:47,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because we had kick the Ultra K a while back.

552
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we'll do kick the Sony vending machine.

553
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:50,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what.

554
00:38:50,186 --> 00:38:50,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what.

555
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:53,247
[SPEAKER_07]: The top photo will win something.

556
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:57,226
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sony vending machine actually isn't a vending machine.

557
00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:00,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the PlayStation 3 case.

558
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:02,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

559
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:03,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep it moving.

560
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, speaking of the PlayStation 3, there was a pretty...

561
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:27,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny observation made this week on the PlayStation 3, and it kind of dates back to E3, but somebody was going through their E3 pictures, looking at the pictures of the Sony controller for the PlayStation 3, and looked really closely and saw that something was wrong with the select button on the controller, on the prototype there.

562
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:31,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't say select, and this is the controller that was in the glass case next to the PlayStation 3.

563
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:34,581
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't say select, it said surrect.

564
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,541
[SPEAKER_04]: S-E-R-E-C-T S-E-R-E-C-T

565
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:03,908
[SPEAKER_04]: A blatant error.

566
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:04,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

567
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anybody asked Sony directly about this?

568
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:09,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

569
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:11,713
[SPEAKER_04]: That's silly.

570
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:14,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Loki, how about the Wii controller?

571
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:20,878
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii controller, according to Miyamoto, not going to have a microphone.

572
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:28,285
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it would increase the price of the console too much to justify the inclusion of a microphone.

573
00:40:28,685 --> 00:40:32,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I call bullshit though, because I mean, come on, a microphone that small can't cost anything.

574
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's going to be like a buck or two.

575
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:38,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, it's going to cost that much more.

576
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And even still, if they want to say that they're not going to put one on there, there is a little fucking connection in the back.

577
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:45,825
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pop in a microphone right there.

578
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:51,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm still saying... Why doesn't Nintendo just do the Nintendo thing and add it later?

579
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,771
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a microphone in the DS.

580
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:54,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't...

581
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:56,133
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

582
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,663
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's going to say that you need to have a DS in order to play certain games, and they're not going to do that.

583
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:28,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could do that for some games, I imagine, but I would say why not just... They could easily add a microphone to this.

584
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:35,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's a space issue, because the controller is pretty small, but microphones nowadays...

585
00:41:37,018 --> 00:42:05,702
[SPEAKER_03]: small electronic devices they're damn tiny and I know they can't be too expensive like a buck or two really and that's you know going and buying the parts at Radio Shack let alone what they get you know at cost so who knows you will bow to me in our chat room says they need a mic that registers blue without saying brew if you've played that's voice recognition software that has nothing to do with you know whatever all right

586
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:17,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I just might.

587
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:24,385
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, you know, I think that we're not the only ones frustrated with the PS3, you know?

588
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of developers are pretty pissed off about it, too.

589
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, a lot of developers are leaving the PS3 to start develop on the Wii, and LucasArts is one of them.

590
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:52,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there are, uh, actually some rumors that actually they were printed in the last, uh, EGM are saying that, uh, you know, so far they're still in the rumor phase, but it seems a lot of the third party developers are kind of pissed off at Sony and, uh, have gone over to a system that they're going to be able to sell more games on.

591
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the games are going to cost more to develop for the PlayStation three.

592
00:42:56,662 --> 00:42:58,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not viable for them to do business on.

593
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:06,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of areas are looking to move over, and they're saying that now LucasArts is one of them who's working on a Star Wars game for the Wii.

594
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:13,409
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to take advantage of the controller and the sound, the speaker in the controller.

595
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:16,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, think of a lightsaber game.

596
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:22,131
[SPEAKER_04]: If that pans out the way it describes there, that's going to be bad news for Sony.

597
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:24,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony shot themselves.

598
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:25,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't feel sorry for them at all.

599
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:27,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe they can win them back.

600
00:43:27,632 --> 00:43:28,492
[SPEAKER_04]: What can they do to win them back?

601
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,240
[SPEAKER_04]: More first party games.

602
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,943
[SPEAKER_07]: How about, you know, make a system that isn't complete ass.

603
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:35,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Focus on the games, not what they look like.

604
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:38,447
[SPEAKER_03]: More twisted metal, more violent twisted metal.

605
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:40,029
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the way to do it.

606
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:42,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Guns, violence, hookers, Loki.

607
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:44,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of gun violent hooker games.

608
00:43:44,512 --> 00:43:47,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe, I don't know, put out Gran Turismo that's not a port of an older one.

609
00:43:48,236 --> 00:43:49,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a good start.

610
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:50,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

611
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:56,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back over to the Wii for a minute, you know, I gotta say lots of cool points.

612
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:57,919
[SPEAKER_04]: on Nintendo.

613
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:00,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just one more kind of to add to that.

614
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:10,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is showing controllers for the Wii behind closed doors that resemble pads from the TurboGrafx-16, the Genesis, the NES.

615
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:11,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this.

616
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:17,207
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that you can actually plug these into your Wii controller and use these for the virtual console.

617
00:44:18,147 --> 00:44:22,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the problem is this story is a little bit different the several times I've read about it this week.

618
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:30,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody on our forums actually posted a picture of all these things in a briefcase saying that you would be able to plug in your old controller.

619
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:35,121
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have old Super Nintendo controllers sitting around the house just gathering dust, you could plug these in.

620
00:44:35,141 --> 00:44:35,741
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be an adapter.

621
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:38,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You can plug it into the Wii controller and use them on the virtual console.

622
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:44,006
[SPEAKER_04]: But now other stories I'm reading say that, no, they're making new ones that resemble the old controllers.

623
00:44:44,046 --> 00:44:45,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So we kind of have a little bit of a disconnect there.

624
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:47,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So this could all just be a bunch of crap.

625
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:50,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, third party can always come out and create something like that.

626
00:44:50,448 --> 00:44:50,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

627
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:52,868
[SPEAKER_04]: See, third party would probably create it anyway.

628
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:58,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But if Nintendo's doing this themselves, I love the adapter idea for virtual console.

629
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you kind of think about, okay, well, would I be able to use like a Super Nintendo controller on the NES games?

630
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:05,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why not, I guess.

631
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:07,812
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, Nintendo's going to have to kind of think all that out.

632
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:12,345
[SPEAKER_04]: and how weird is that going to be to use a Sega Genesis controller to play a Nintendo game?

633
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:13,566
[SPEAKER_04]: How weird is that going to be?

634
00:45:14,186 --> 00:45:14,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

635
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:18,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of weird.

636
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:27,273
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura going into a virtual gaming system of a different type.

637
00:45:28,753 --> 00:45:31,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess what has finally happened?

638
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:31,875
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

639
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:36,017
[SPEAKER_07]: We have seen Geometry Wars defeated by UNO.

640
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:38,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

641
00:45:38,576 --> 00:45:40,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, people playing it, or what?

642
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:48,946
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox 360 version of Uno is the highest daily demo-to-sale conversion of any Xbox Live Arcade game.

643
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:49,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

644
00:45:49,707 --> 00:45:52,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It even topped Geometry Wars Retro Evolved.

645
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:53,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

646
00:45:53,771 --> 00:45:55,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

647
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:56,814
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, like, not just that.

648
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, it's given it the SmackDown...

649
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:05,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it's about $0.40 to $0.55 profit, I think, more per sale.

650
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me look a little bit further.

651
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:09,282
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, they're sort of using that now.

652
00:46:09,362 --> 00:46:12,324
[SPEAKER_07]: They could make other card games and see if that tops.

653
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:13,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, goody.

654
00:46:13,225 --> 00:46:16,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to get a sea of card games that are only going to be mediocre.

655
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas Hold'em is coming in July.

656
00:46:17,728 --> 00:46:19,530
[SPEAKER_07]: You know people will be playing that.

657
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:20,891
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of poker fiends.

658
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:21,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't be one of them.

659
00:46:22,332 --> 00:46:24,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the poker thing is kind of a little overrated.

660
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:26,494
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what's even going to be worse?

661
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:30,778
[SPEAKER_03]: When the Xbox Live Vision comes out.

662
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,841
[SPEAKER_03]: There is going to be so much...

663
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:38,082
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

664
00:47:01,938 --> 00:47:05,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, any story on Xbox Live brings the mandatory comment here.

665
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,161
[SPEAKER_04]: DigiNova says, I want Street Fighter on Live.

666
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:08,881
[SPEAKER_04]: When will it come?

667
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you like Microsoft's little cock tease this week?

668
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,724
[SPEAKER_04]: They put up Street Fighter 2 themes and pictures, user pictures.

669
00:47:16,424 --> 00:47:16,944
[SPEAKER_04]: No game.

670
00:47:17,564 --> 00:47:26,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you go into the Xbox Live and you go in to download new stuff, Street Fighter 2 comes up and you go like, holy shit, finally.

671
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:31,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you go in there and it's themes and gamer pictures for the low, low price of a couple hundred gamer points.

672
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:35,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, son of a... Ah, funny.

673
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:38,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe they're just trying to build hype.

674
00:47:38,811 --> 00:47:39,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

675
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:40,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

676
00:47:40,312 --> 00:47:41,333
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be out when it's out.

677
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:42,273
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know anymore.

678
00:47:42,313 --> 00:47:43,814
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to try and speculate anymore.

679
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:46,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom can give a date and it'll be wrong.

680
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:49,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

681
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:52,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you have a story about Grand Theft Auto 4.

682
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the rumor...

683
00:47:55,063 --> 00:47:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor people are saying out there is that it's going to be an MMO.

684
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:09,114
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons now that they're thinking that is because on the Rockstar Norse site, they're looking for in-game animators, level design motion editors, and network programmers.

685
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:15,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're thinking, oh, network programmer, that must mean that they're going to make it an MMO.

686
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the hell not.

687
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how many people will play as the hooker?

688
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:21,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, listen.

689
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:23,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why this will never work.

690
00:48:23,585 --> 00:48:23,665
[SPEAKER_03]: One...

691
00:48:24,525 --> 00:48:28,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockstar does not know how to program multiplayer to save their life.

692
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:30,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It is awful when it comes to Grand Theft Auto.

693
00:48:49,086 --> 00:49:15,546
[SPEAKER_03]: so awful but there's a lot to work on and they definitely need people to be doing that plus I mean if you're going to be doing multiplayer in a game like that it's probably going to be a lot more complex than you know table tennis was I don't think this says anything about it being an MMO and I don't think that they would start off with an MMO I don't know I don't think it's going to happen episodic content yes MMO no I've played table tennis online and it's fine it plays fluid

694
00:49:16,392 --> 00:49:20,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they had the same people working on Liberty City Stories on the PSP.

695
00:49:20,997 --> 00:49:24,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice City Stories is goddamn perfect.

696
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,623
[SPEAKER_03]: You think Grand Theft Auto 4 will be multiplayer in some capacity or another?

697
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:28,985
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

698
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:30,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.

699
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:33,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was live-aware, and that's it.

700
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:39,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, we thought the same thing with Liberty City Stories on the PS2.

701
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,656
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried...

702
00:49:41,298 --> 00:49:43,778
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were unsuccessful to get it working.

703
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:54,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So what makes you think they're going to be... I mean, maybe Xbox Live might be a little bit easier than PlayStation 3, but I'm not going to be too surprised if it doesn't have multiplayer.

704
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:59,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope, because that'd be awesome, but I don't think it's going to.

705
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:00,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Comments on Grand Theft Auto Online.

706
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:05,362
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPalace says it'll turn into The Sims Online, which you've probably heard us talk about on the show before.

707
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Just basically turn into Drugs and Sex, Sims Online.

708
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:14,789
[SPEAKER_04]: YouWillBowToMe says, I want to play as the guy who works at the chicken joint in a Grand Theft Auto MMO.

709
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:20,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the multiplayer in the PSP version, I like the modes that they have.

710
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,835
[SPEAKER_03]: If they worked right, it'd be great.

711
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:28,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, eight-man, six-man teams or whatever, that'd be perfect.

712
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Just doing a simple deathmatch like any other game.

713
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:33,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be a full-blown MMO.

714
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:37,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make the modes work correctly, and then it'll be great.

715
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:48,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, speaking of MMOs, there's been another rumor going around the internet this week about Blizzard MMOs and that Blizzard is going to turn into this MMO-only company.

716
00:50:48,918 --> 00:51:06,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically what happened is that F13.net did some type of presentation to Wall Street and a rep from Vivendi said, all Blizzard franchises will become MMOs, to which StarCraft fans and Diablo fans everywhere pooped their pants simultaneously when they heard this.

717
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you think there could be any truth in this?

718
00:51:09,938 --> 00:51:28,223
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because Blizzard actually, when GameSpot questioned them about this whole rumor, they said, Alas, for those yearning for a marathon World of Starcraft session, Blizzard moved quickly the quash rumors of any non-World of Warcraft MMOs.

719
00:51:29,323 --> 00:51:31,524
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's just a rumor, and

720
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:43,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that rumor circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of information provided to industry analysts.

721
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:53,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I remember correctly, they had slides that basically showed potential for these games to grow in those areas, not necessarily guaranteeing that they will grow in there.

722
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:59,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I'm going to piss off some Blizzard fans by saying this, but I don't care.

723
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:03,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But isn't World of Warcraft just Diablo MMO with Warcraft characters?

724
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:05,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, yeah.

725
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:08,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You already have your Diablo MMO.

726
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:08,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's wrong.

727
00:52:09,149 --> 00:52:09,910
[SPEAKER_03]: StarCraft maybe.

728
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:14,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that might be kind of cool, I guess, but it'd be pretty much the same.

729
00:52:14,794 --> 00:52:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what I think.

730
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,516
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki.

731
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:25,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, speaking of MMOs, we see these stories come up once in a while, but they're banning more gold sellers, or what's going on?

732
00:52:25,526 --> 00:52:27,988
[SPEAKER_03]: They've suspended more than 250 accounts.

733
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:34,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to them, they... Wait, is this World of Warcraft or is this something else?

734
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:35,953
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Final Fantasy XI.

735
00:52:35,993 --> 00:52:47,480
[SPEAKER_03]: They've suspended 250 accounts and have retrieved some $250 billion in gil that's been removed from circulation as response to this.

736
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a lot of gil.

737
00:52:50,763 --> 00:52:50,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

738
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:53,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of leaning towards a no.

739
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:14,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I had stuff to do!

740
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Final Fantasy XI isn't the only game where this is happening.

741
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:38,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It is happening in World of Warcraft as well.

742
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:45,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard has banned more than 30,000 accounts during May alone for gold farming.

743
00:53:45,214 --> 00:53:45,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a quote.

744
00:53:46,335 --> 00:53:57,401
[SPEAKER_04]: In keeping with Blizzard's aggressive stance against cheating in World of Warcraft, we banned over 30,000 accounts in the month of May, and with that removed over 30 million gold from the economy across all realms.

745
00:53:57,782 --> 00:54:01,404
[SPEAKER_04]: The banned accounts were taking part in activities that violate the game's terms of use...

746
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:10,240
[SPEAKER_04]: including using third-party programs to farm gold and items, which severely impacts the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.

747
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like there's steps going on in a lot of the big MMOs to boot the gold farmers.

748
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:28,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of interesting, but what's also interesting about that, let's see, if we take 30 million and divide that by 30,000, that's 1,000 gold a person about that was taken out of the economy, but...

749
00:54:29,656 --> 00:54:29,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

750
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:38,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people who are really, really addicted to World of Warcraft at their level 60s that a thousand gold is attainable for the normal player.

751
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:41,425
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny about all of this?

752
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:45,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's always saying, you know, this gold farming is funny.

753
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:50,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't really had any effect on the prices of gold.

754
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:58,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember every now and then, just out of curiosity, I would go and look over at IGE to see how much they're selling gold for and stuff.

755
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:03,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And the prices just keep dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping.

756
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:05,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's because they can't sell it anymore.

757
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think because there's more out there, they would have to drop the prices.

758
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:13,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's interesting, too, about World of Warcraft is there's so many realms.

759
00:55:13,795 --> 00:55:15,375
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many realms now.

760
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:16,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be hard.

761
00:55:16,156 --> 00:55:17,196
[SPEAKER_04]: They've added more.

762
00:55:17,216 --> 00:55:19,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right, because they've added the new one I just started on.

763
00:55:19,637 --> 00:55:22,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Airy Peak is the one I'm playing on now that just opened up over the weekend.

764
00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:23,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know...

765
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:24,823
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

766
00:55:53,106 --> 00:55:56,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, where should all the kids be pointing their browsers this week?

767
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,512
[SPEAKER_07]: This spoke to my special places.

768
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:03,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a site called... I'm sure it did.

769
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:05,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Well now.

770
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:10,732
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's stuck in my head because I've been still going to Weebles every day.

771
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:13,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this show going to need the explicit tag on it?

772
00:56:14,232 --> 00:56:14,912
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

773
00:56:15,493 --> 00:56:24,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, last night I was on Weebles stuff watching one of the Weeble and Bob episodes that had that stuck in my head.

774
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:25,534
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, that's not my side of the week.

775
00:56:25,554 --> 00:56:26,294
[SPEAKER_07]: That was an old side of the week.

776
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:27,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Still awesome site, though.

777
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:34,976
[SPEAKER_07]: The site of the week this time around is eskadub.uncreativity.com The Catastrophe of Escaflowne.

778
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:36,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is fabulous.

779
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:43,948
[SPEAKER_07]: But the specific, specific thing on here is if you go under their downloads page, click on Sephiroth's Sexy Choir.

780
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,510
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to watch it.

781
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:47,571
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a link to YouTube.

782
00:56:49,213 --> 00:56:51,375
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Sexy Roth.

783
00:56:52,516 --> 00:56:53,637
[SPEAKER_07]: With Aerith's Death of Vision.

784
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:56,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hilarious video.

785
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:57,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So well done.

786
00:56:57,505 --> 00:56:59,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it's... There's a couple cosplayers.

787
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:01,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they filmed it in an anime convention.

788
00:57:01,546 --> 00:57:03,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea where this... There's like a squall cosplayer.

789
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can clearly see a squall cosplayer.

790
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:10,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're singing the One Wing Angel, but it's sexy Roth and they... He's got a flat ass.

791
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:12,789
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a sexy ass.

792
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:14,510
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Death of Vision is the best part.

793
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,930
[SPEAKER_07]: The Earth Death of Vision is great.

794
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:17,030
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite line.

795
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to stand there, Cloud.

796
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:20,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.

797
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:30,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Because while the choir is singing, just so you guys know, because this is radio, so it's hard for us to explain, but they've got like this, they play that death scene from Final Fantasy VII over and over again.

798
00:57:31,037 --> 00:57:32,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we want people to go to the site.

799
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:33,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get into copyright things.

800
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:33,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the site.

801
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:34,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

802
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:45,086
[SPEAKER_04]: But they play that, they loop that sequence from Final Fantasy VII where Aerith dies over and over again and then like put different filters on it, like black and white and then trippy color and sepia and all this stuff.

803
00:57:45,347 --> 00:57:46,007
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy.

804
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Aerith Death of Vision.

805
00:57:47,508 --> 00:57:48,008
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

806
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:49,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Genius.

807
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure genius.

808
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:51,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, kids.

809
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,240
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my side of the week.

810
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I approve of DarkSakura's side of the week.

811
00:57:55,321 --> 00:58:02,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, the site is escadub.uncreativity.com Go click on downloads.

812
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:03,986
[SPEAKER_07]: You will not regret it.

813
00:58:04,186 --> 00:58:05,446
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll make you fall out of your chair.

814
00:58:06,027 --> 00:58:09,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not be drinking Mountain Dew when you watch this, or it will end up on your monitor.

815
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:10,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it say that on the site?

816
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:11,570
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

817
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's what happened to you?

818
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:14,291
[SPEAKER_07]: A friendly warning.

819
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:18,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I would come up with that.

820
00:58:19,773 --> 00:58:21,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than I snorted Mountain Dew out of my nose.

821
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:24,155
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome, because I gave that link to Jamie to begin with.

822
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:24,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

823
00:58:26,116 --> 00:58:26,996
[SPEAKER_07]: But not really, I lied.

824
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:27,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you had some Windex.

825
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:32,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, let's talk Guitar Hero.

826
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:34,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, talk about this game never calms down.

827
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:35,840
[SPEAKER_04]: People just love their Guitar Hero.

828
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

829
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:47,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you love the Guitar Hero game, you're going to love the Guitar Hero third-party controller being put out by Lixang, and it's called the Shredder.

830
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:53,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks very similar to normal Guitar Hero guitar, except a little bit more metal, I would say.

831
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,713
[SPEAKER_03]: The shredder... Yeah, it looks pretty neat.

832
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:57,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

833
00:58:57,293 --> 00:58:58,733
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, Jamie?

834
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:04,496
[SPEAKER_07]: They had it on... It looks like it's trying to be a really deformed Gibson Thunderbird.

835
00:59:06,116 --> 00:59:07,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to smash it on stage.

836
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:10,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, the shredder makes me think of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

837
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe all that hardware for making coleslaw.

838
00:59:14,022 --> 00:59:14,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps.

839
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It is quite steep, though, in price.

840
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:23,105
[SPEAKER_03]: $48.90 was what the exchange rate ends up being.

841
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:27,567
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of price for aesthetics.

842
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:34,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to point out it took about three seconds for somebody in the chat room, Brack2000, to come up with a punchline.

843
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:35,930
[SPEAKER_04]: What will they come up with next?

844
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,490
[SPEAKER_04]: The Krag?

845
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:37,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the Krang?

846
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:40,272
[SPEAKER_04]: The Krag is a different show.

847
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:43,793
[SPEAKER_07]: If they do a drum game, then they'll come out with the foot.

848
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:49,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

849
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:50,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo!

850
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:52,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off the show!

851
00:59:52,495 --> 00:59:52,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off!

852
00:59:54,436 --> 00:59:55,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-uh.

853
00:59:57,037 --> 01:00:00,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, a quote from someone who can't get into the chat room.

854
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:04,541
[SPEAKER_07]: To the Shredder, I say, tonight we dine on turtle soup.

855
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:07,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on the Shredder?

856
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,423
[SPEAKER_07]: That was from Tiara, by the way.

857
01:00:10,723 --> 01:00:12,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on the Shredder, Loki?

858
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks stupid.

859
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:16,722
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

860
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:46,034
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCube, Tenchu, Time of the Assassins on PSP.

861
01:01:15,527 --> 01:01:22,832
[SPEAKER_07]: and, uh, I'll go ahead and jump to the 30th, which I will be repeating next week, but there's also a Def Jam fight for New York and the new Super Mario Bros.

862
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, that's exciting.

863
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:27,316
[SPEAKER_07]: New Super Mario Bros.

864
01:01:27,376 --> 01:01:28,697
[SPEAKER_07]: is pretty darn cool.

865
01:01:29,217 --> 01:01:30,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Glad you guys are getting it.

866
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:32,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, Magic kind of wore off after a few days, I don't know.

867
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:32,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

868
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario!

869
01:01:34,761 --> 01:01:39,485
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good game and all, but I don't know, just kind of... Mario is hotness.

870
01:01:39,785 --> 01:01:39,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

871
01:01:39,885 --> 01:01:40,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

872
01:01:40,939 --> 01:01:44,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more excited about the GameCube with the Super Paper Mario.

873
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,680
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks hot.

874
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:50,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Mario, I noticed something today on my new shiny DS light screen.

875
01:01:50,381 --> 01:01:50,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

876
01:01:51,101 --> 01:02:00,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with the increase in brightness and resolution on it, I noticed that if you have the arcade machine in your house in Animal Crossing, it's Mario vs. Luigi on a fighting game.

877
01:02:02,464 --> 01:02:05,025
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a hell of a lot of detail to notice.

878
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:05,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

879
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:06,405
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no life.

880
01:02:07,465 --> 01:02:07,905
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

881
01:02:08,506 --> 01:02:08,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

882
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:09,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

883
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:13,779
[SPEAKER_04]: What's coming out for our friends here stateside, Loki?

884
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:14,820
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole lot of nothing.

885
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:21,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you like NFL Head Coach, in which case that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

886
01:02:21,186 --> 01:02:22,447
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some folks that are into that.

887
01:02:22,527 --> 01:02:25,229
[SPEAKER_03]: We may not talk a lot about sports games, but there you go.

888
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm not knocking sports games.

889
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,232
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a sports strategy game.

890
01:02:28,252 --> 01:02:30,033
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to play the teams, you get to coach them.

891
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:30,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

892
01:02:31,234 --> 01:02:34,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That's even like some sports fans won't even touch this.

893
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:34,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

894
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:34,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways...

895
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, there is MotoGP 4, which is coming out on PlayStation 2.

896
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:42,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider Legends, finally making it to PSP.

897
01:02:43,702 --> 01:02:47,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And Legend of Heroes 2, The Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch, also coming to PSP.

898
01:02:48,623 --> 01:02:55,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And for your DS fans, Sudoku Mania, yay, and Break Em All is going to be coming out.

899
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:57,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are pretty lame.

900
01:02:58,425 --> 01:03:00,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week's going to be some good stuff, though.

901
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:04,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to get one of the games that's coming out, even though I don't have an Xbox to play it on.

902
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:06,273
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

903
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:08,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Krusty Demon's Freestyle Motocross.

904
01:03:10,575 --> 01:03:11,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of this.

905
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:21,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this game is like a cross between Tony Hawk, an off-road game, and Flat Out.

906
01:03:21,138 --> 01:03:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's like BMX XXX with motorcycles, is what it's like.

907
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:27,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

908
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

909
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:36,384
[SPEAKER_03]: You get points for injuring your rider, and it's just really cheeseball.

910
01:03:36,444 --> 01:03:36,684
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

911
01:03:36,704 --> 01:03:37,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what, Loki.

912
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:45,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I need to hang on to Oblivion a little while longer, I'll let you borrow the big green brick if you want to have an Xbox for a little while.

913
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:46,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my big green brick outside.

914
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:49,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to pick up the game first, so I'll bring it over, and we'll see.

915
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:50,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

916
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:52,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds fair.

917
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we were on UK just a second ago, and there's actually a story that kind of affects them that you had.

918
01:03:59,554 --> 01:04:11,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Why, right, um, actually, uh, I can never pronounce this right, if it's Gamas, or Gamas, I would assume Gamasutra given Kamasutra, but, um, anyway, uh, a series of- We like it better that way because it's sexier.

919
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,180
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so hot.

920
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just, uh, special places.

921
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:27,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, the, uh, video store, uh, Game, a big, uh, retailer in the UK, is going to be, uh, changing its, uh, return policy for software-

922
01:04:28,606 --> 01:04:49,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now basically a customer can return a game within 10 days as long as the packaging is complete but regardless of whether it's been opened or used now it's going to have its own seal on the packaging and if that seal is broken you will not be able to return it if it's broken within I believe 28 days.

923
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:49,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

924
01:04:55,086 --> 01:04:57,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if there's a date on there.

925
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:05,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this says that basically... I don't see the date when it's actually supposed to be rolling into effect, so I suppose it's already going into effect.

926
01:05:06,509 --> 01:05:09,790
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 700 owned and franchised stores in Europe.

927
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:14,030
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 23 in the UK alone, 81 in continental Europe.

928
01:05:17,188 --> 01:05:25,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, this is enacted because a lot of their profits went from 20 million pounds to 8.4 million.

929
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:32,315
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically in the series of 12 months that ended at the end of January this year.

930
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:37,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, they're enacting this, I'm pretty much guessing, to save their financial butt.

931
01:05:39,618 --> 01:05:39,918
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

932
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:40,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

933
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:44,740
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com One of the top games in Europe is a soccer management sim.

934
01:05:59,059 --> 01:05:59,619
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do?

935
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Soccer sounds like an abuse term.

936
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Bandit would like to clarify, when I was offering to let you borrow the big green brick, is that an Xbox Halo edition?

937
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:37,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

938
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:38,861
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I finally caved and bought an Xbox.

939
01:06:38,881 --> 01:06:43,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I have to, when my old Xbox died.

940
01:06:43,783 --> 01:06:46,824
[SPEAKER_04]: For quite a long time, I would not get an Xbox.

941
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:47,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were crap.

942
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:59,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I was of that school of thought where all the games that were on Xbox was nothing I was interested in, and then finally I caved right about the time the Halo Xbox had come out, and I thought, ooh, it's a pretty green one, too.

943
01:06:59,248 --> 01:06:59,808
[SPEAKER_04]: That's even better.

944
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:01,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's when I finally caved and bought it.

945
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:04,410
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

946
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep it moving here.

947
01:07:07,552 --> 01:07:09,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki has one more story for this segment.

948
01:07:10,554 --> 01:07:13,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bricks may or may not be involved in this.

949
01:07:13,235 --> 01:07:13,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Loki?

950
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:15,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

951
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:18,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Uybol challenges you.

952
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You, the bad reviewer.

953
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:28,824
[SPEAKER_03]: No, basically Uybol has put out a press release saying that he wants to fight the people that are criticizing his movie.

954
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:30,424
[SPEAKER_03]: His position?

955
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:31,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I am fed up.

956
01:07:31,804 --> 01:07:35,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I am fed up with people slamming my films on the internet without seeing them.

957
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:38,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they do still suck even after you watch them.

958
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:47,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Many journalists make value judgments on my films based on the opinions of one or two thousand internet voices.

959
01:07:47,968 --> 01:07:52,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Half of the... Because one or two thousand people on the internet don't mean shit.

960
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, first off,

961
01:08:11,897 --> 01:08:15,619
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of have a pretty good system there where you can't vote until the movie comes out.

962
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of invalid.

963
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And two, it's IMDB.

964
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gives a shit what your rating is on there?

965
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,784
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a completely subjective website.

966
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:28,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with... It doesn't get published in a paper or something like that.

967
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

968
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:31,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways, it goes on.

969
01:08:32,082 --> 01:08:41,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it says, Ui is now challenging the critics that have failed to watch his films prior to reviewing or commenting to put up or shut up.

970
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Towards the end of filming Postal, the five most

971
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Outspoken critics will be flown into Vancouver and supplied with hotel rooms.

972
01:08:52,924 --> 01:09:05,453
[SPEAKER_03]: As a guest of Ui Bowl, they will be given the chance to be an extra slash stand-in in Postal and have the opportunity to put on boxing gloves and enter a boxing ring to fight Ui Bowl.

973
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:10,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Each critic will have the opportunity to bring down Ui in a five-bout match.

974
01:09:10,757 --> 01:09:12,940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

975
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:33,907
[SPEAKER_03]: or at least two extremely negative articles in the year 2005.

976
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:36,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Critics of 2006 will not be considered.

977
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:42,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Please submit proof of your negative reviews and comments via email to info.bull.kg.com

978
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:54,451
[SPEAKER_04]: KQ.E So you're being rewarded for bashing Uibo films by being in an Uibo film?

979
01:09:54,631 --> 01:09:57,675
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to box you, but here's the thing that he forgot to mention.

980
01:09:57,995 --> 01:10:00,779
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to be a boxer, so that's not exactly fair.

981
01:10:01,099 --> 01:10:02,882
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, you have to weigh between 140 and 190 pounds.

982
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,801
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

983
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:34,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet having a chick put her application in there, I bet that would be... You want to do it?

984
01:10:34,788 --> 01:10:36,109
[SPEAKER_04]: For the sake of the show, you want to fight him?

985
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:38,892
[SPEAKER_04]: She's grinning.

986
01:10:39,813 --> 01:10:44,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it, and I'll watch his movies so I can be critical of them.

987
01:10:44,057 --> 01:10:46,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be like, I wasted those four hours.

988
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you two to figure it out.

989
01:10:48,001 --> 01:10:49,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one of you two is going to put in the application?

990
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:51,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm too fat to fight him.

991
01:10:51,885 --> 01:10:53,647
[SPEAKER_07]: To be perfectly honest, I actually...

992
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:54,928
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

993
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:19,191
[SPEAKER_07]: and Boot Camp Training.

994
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:19,651
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fun.

995
01:11:19,851 --> 01:11:21,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like our chat room approves, so we'll see.

996
01:11:21,912 --> 01:11:24,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to see what we can do to put together an application.

997
01:11:24,953 --> 01:11:27,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to be joining a gym next week.

998
01:11:27,694 --> 01:11:29,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can lose the weight then, Fatty.

999
01:11:30,835 --> 01:11:31,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, ass.

1000
01:11:34,636 --> 01:11:37,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note, we're going to go ahead and call it, you know, I'm just kidding.

1001
01:11:38,018 --> 01:11:38,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

1002
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:42,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a street fight, not boxing.

1003
01:11:42,797 --> 01:11:44,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be full contact.

1004
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:45,799
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do what I've been doing.

1005
01:11:45,859 --> 01:11:47,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I've dropped three pounds by eating whatever I want.

1006
01:11:50,303 --> 01:11:52,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's like little bits of everything.

1007
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:53,346
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it called?

1008
01:11:53,366 --> 01:11:54,067
[SPEAKER_04]: The fuck it diet?

1009
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's the fuck it diet.

1010
01:11:55,388 --> 01:11:55,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

1011
01:11:56,008 --> 01:11:57,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You just stop when you're not hungry.

1012
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:57,670
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1013
01:11:58,531 --> 01:12:00,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, on that note, we're going to end this segment.

1014
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:02,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to a little bit of a break here.
