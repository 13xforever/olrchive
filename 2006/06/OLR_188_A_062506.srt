[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, 21st.

27
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:14,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, it's a big one.

28
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:14,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 21st.

29
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you celebrate the 21st birthday?

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you go to a bar, get tossed?

31
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:18,761
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

32
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:20,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a Guinness, went to bed.

33
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:21,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

34
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:22,944
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's all right.

35
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:27,246
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think my 21st birthday was probably about that exciting too, so it's all good.

36
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:27,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal.

37
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:28,327
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

38
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like you do everything bad and then when you're 21 it's like, eh, no big deal.

39
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:33,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

40
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm actually old enough to be doing this.

41
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:36,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can do it legally.

42
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:38,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's the reason to?

43
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:39,493

[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

73
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:28,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only have you dated yourself this evening, now you've made yourself an obvious nerd.

74
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

75
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Who plays Buffy roleplay?

76
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:34,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be a hardcore nerd to be doing Buffy roleplay.

77
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:38,919
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one that picked up the GURPS book today.

78
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know what it was.

79
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what's a GURP?

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like a LARP?

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.

82
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, my second roleplay ever was GURPS.

83
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:50,956
[SPEAKER_00]: My third was Shadowrun.

84
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:51,976
[SPEAKER_00]: My fourth was D&D.

85
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you have dated yourself.

86
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:58,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I have definitely not progressed past third edition D&D.

87
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:00,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I refuse to play third edition.

88
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I started on second edition.

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I still had first edition books.

90
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,862
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not the first person I've heard say something negative about third edition.

91
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:09,642
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so bad about it?

92
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:10,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.

93
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:14,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for constitution-based magic casting, I miss Thacko.

94
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so easy.

95
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 2 Call of Duty 2

96
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Download for free to work.

97
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:50,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one of the maps that had this giant silo on it, and you basically climb up to the top and snipe people down from the top of the... So that's actually pretty fun, to play just that map.

98
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:54,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Played a little bit more Blazing Angels, trying to beat the damn thing all the way.

99
00:05:55,314 --> 00:06:00,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of Mutant Storm Reloaded, because I'm on level 89, and I have to beat it.

100
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:06,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, all the effort I put into that, and I looked at the achievement that that unlocks, and that's like 15 points.

101
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:06,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like,

102
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:08,779
[SPEAKER_03]: is it really worth the 15 points?

103
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're on level 89 at this point, you might as well finish it.

104
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: How many levels are there?

105
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 95 or something, right?

106
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:17,663
[SPEAKER_04]: No, 89.

107
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:20,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're on the very last level and you just can't beat it?

108
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:21,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

109
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,806
[SPEAKER_03]: The difficulty, like, it ramps up very strange.

110
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:29,428
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets really hard, then it kind of gets easier, then it's super duper hard.

111
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:30,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't get it.

112
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:31,629
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

113
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's an okay game.

114
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to finish this and get the damn achievement.

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Gauntlet for a little bit, and I don't know why.

116
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:44,682
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I tried that.

117
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Achievement points?

118
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:46,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You want more achievement points?

119
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:51,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was looking at your profile, and you don't have any achievement points for Gauntlet, and I have like 25.

120
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:53,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, I am the better Gauntlet player than you.

121
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:54,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because I haven't played Gauntlet.

122
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:56,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

123
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:59,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, what else did I play?

124
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I played...

125
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:03,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Wack-a-mole

126
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:23,744
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole lot of that.

127
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,306
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been trying to see how we can exploit the demo.

128
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep forgetting to download that.

129
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:32,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun because the cars, the police cars are stupid.

130
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:36,690
[SPEAKER_04]: They downloaded that at Arena the week of E3 and I played it like once and it was kind of cool.

131
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I haven't been excited about a test drive game since like the days of Commodore 64 and this one looks pretty neat.

132
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:44,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm excited.

133
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:51,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We managed to, I was playing it, the Lamborghini goes quite fast off-road, ironically enough, and

134
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,842
[SPEAKER_03]: The police cannot get you if you're off-road.

135
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:58,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we took an SUV, we slammed into it, and we knocked it into the ocean.

136
00:07:58,743 --> 00:07:59,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Well done.

137
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:00,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You should get points for that.

138
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:10,926
[SPEAKER_03]: We knocked it into the ocean, which is supposed to be just, like, you know, a few inches deep when it's washing ashore, but apparently the way the game's designed, it's just a cliff, and the car just disappeared.

139
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:15,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And I jumped the fence, and I jumped into this yard that I couldn't get out of, which was fun.

140
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:18,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also got my car smashed...

141
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:23,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuck Between a Rock and a House, and what other fun stuff did we do?

142
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:25,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we jumped a mountain.

143
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:26,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

144
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:33,858
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game is very flawed, but I guess it's just a demo right now.

145
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:37,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously not even near finished, but there's a lot of things that got fixed on that.

146
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,681
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot, a lot of things.

147
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:41,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know, we'll see.

148
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:44,903
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the game that my boss says we'll get him to buy in Xbox 360.

149
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:47,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you know, there's a lot of better games out there.

150
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:49,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Why this one?

151
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,589
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

152
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

153
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,452
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was also kind of unexciting.

154
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:56,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really play a lot of new stuff.

155
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:01,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Burnout, you know, because there's nothing more fun than doing the synth pop.

156
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout, running through the traffic attack.

157
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:09,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once in a while I'll throw in Journey Greatest Hits or ABBA or something like really, you know, weird.

158
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's fun to drive to.

159
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was playing World of Warcraft.

160
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on LA for most of the week with a business trip.

161
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Which reminds me, if you go to All Games Interactive's show, and I know a lot of you guys listen to them over at allgames.com, I'm on their Tuesday show this week.

162
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:34,737
[SPEAKER_04]: because I dropped by Arena right after work on Tuesday, and I was in a really bad mood on Tuesday.

163
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know I was wrong.

164
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:43,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I woke up at 3.30 in the morning on Tuesday, so I really beat up on a couple of their regulars, and I almost felt bad when I listened to the playback of the show.

165
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, God, I was rude.

166
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:50,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like going to someone's house and drinking all their soda and eating all their food.

167
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:53,145
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what I did on Tuesday, so

168
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:55,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out if you want to see me being a bitch.

169
00:09:56,633 --> 00:10:00,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, as far as new games go, I did look at Big Brain Academy for like five seconds.

170
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:04,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, I'll have to wait and give a full review on that next week.

171
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,234
[SPEAKER_04]: However, let me talk about a book.

172
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:09,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might be thinking, wait, why would you talk about a book on a video game show?

173
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:10,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it has to do with gaming.

174
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:21,597
[SPEAKER_04]: My birthday happens to be tomorrow, and Dark Sakura treated me to a queen for a day, took me out to lunch, took me out to dessert, and then took me to a bookstore and said...

175
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:22,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I Am 8-Bit

176
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mario looks kind of, yeah, it's got a little titty in the book, which makes it even better, right?

177
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:54,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Some porn.

178
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:57,564
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, you said it was erotica.

179
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:58,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sorry, it was erotica.

180
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:01,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Jamie was making fun of me, like, ah, you're buying porn.

181
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, no, it's erotica.

182
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,728
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mario's all looking confused, like he doesn't know what to do.

183
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:11,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But you see, you know how sometimes guys, when they don't know what to do, they'll write notes on their hand?

184
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:14,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, when they want to break up and don't know what to say, they'll write it on their hand?

185
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:14,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I Am 8-Bit

186
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:45,856
[SPEAKER_04]: WonderDog Harold says, I'm sorry Mario, but my dress is in another castle.

187
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:56,386
[SPEAKER_04]: In reference to the photo I was describing there.

188
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:57,287
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.

189
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:57,888
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good time.

190
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,370
[SPEAKER_04]: and to the chatter that gets the most points or the average points, the best average points, wins a Wii.

191
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just is incentive to participate live in our chat room.

192
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:26,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're not there, you should be asking yourself, why am I not there?

193
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, getting into some gaming news tonight.

194
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,922
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not the only ones celebrating a birthday today.

195
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:37,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Sonic is also celebrating his 15th anniversary.

196
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:39,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And GameTap's getting in on the fun.

197
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: They're offering subscribers a trio of titles, which are the lock-on versions of Sonic.

198
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:52,634
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles, Knuckles and Sonic 2, and Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles.

199
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:56,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how you could use the cart and plug it into the old carts and you have a new game?

200
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:57,777
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing.

201
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:58,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

202
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:03,746
[SPEAKER_04]: What a cute technology that you never really saw outside of that.

203
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:04,567
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I don't remember it.

204
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:12,315
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked how you could plug in random Sega games on the cartridge, and then you could do the special stages in different ways with different games.

205
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:12,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

206
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:14,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know you could use it with other games.

207
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,199
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to... Oh, I forgot what it was.

208
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:21,184
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to hold down the buttons while you loaded the game, and it would load up all the special stages on different cartridges.

209
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:22,465
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

210
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:23,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

211
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, you can download those on GameTap.

212
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:29,918
[SPEAKER_04]: No plug-in, no cartridges needed, all that good stuff if you're a GameTap member.

213
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they added on to GameTap TV three behind-the-scenes looks at Sonic the Hedgehog.

214
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:46,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you like to watch that stuff that GameTap TV produces, which is far better than anything GeForce is producing currently, check it out.

215
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:47,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good time.

216
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:55,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, just to join in on the fun here, Sega has revealed that they're going to be doing two new portable Sonic games.

217
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:58,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a first look at those screens there.

218
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:04,890
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're basically doing is that they're going to do Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis for the Game Boy Advance.

219
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to have additions to...

220
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the hell out of that at E3 Oh, what'd you think?

221
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:15,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's so good And I won all the time and they gave me a t-shirt But it really is, it's almost like playing, you know

222
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:44,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Old School Sonic with updated graphics, but instead your goal is just to make it through the level as fast as humanly possible.

223
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:47,648
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like doing the old Tails races in Sonic Adventure.

224
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:48,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

225
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:49,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on 2D.

226
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:51,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

227
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:56,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

228
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:57,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you play it at all?

229
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,734
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.

230
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's definitely one that I would suggest everyone to get out.

231
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:02,537
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know...

232
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:07,447
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of game purchases go on lately.

233
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:14,469
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Mario cut half a million copies in the US in over one month.

234
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:15,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Just over a month.

235
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:18,970
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying basically 20 copies were sold every minute.

236
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think they did the math and that didn't end up being correct.

237
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,271
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's a lot.

238
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the first two days they sold 136,500 units.

239
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:27,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

240
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:28,392
[SPEAKER_00]: So, basically, that's just

241
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:37,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty hardcore for game sales.

242
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:39,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a million, you said?

243
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:40,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a million, 500,000.

244
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:45,221
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty darn good for a game that really hasn't been out that long, all things considered.

245
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:46,542
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the top of the charts.

246
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:47,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

247
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:51,786
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's having the same... The rated E games are taking over.

248
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:57,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's having the same non-stop hysteria-ness here that it's been having in Japan, essentially.

249
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,615
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes to show that old school will win you points for the masses.

250
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:04,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when it comes to Nintendo.

251
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:05,848
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know.

252
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:13,135
[SPEAKER_04]: If Sony were to release a new Crash Bandicoot for the PSP, I don't know if it would have the same... Yeah, I don't know.

253
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Crash Bandicoot, they've really beaten into the ground.

254
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:23,265
[SPEAKER_04]: But isn't that weird that we feel burnt out on Crash Bandicoot, yet Nintendo has way hord Mario more often.

255
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:25,628
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to deviate from the formula, because it works.

256
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:31,207
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing too is Crash Bandicoot is in the first party character.

257
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:34,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I tried to think of a Sony mascot and that's the best thing I can come up with.

258
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:39,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because it was at one point their mascot because that's all they really had.

259
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:42,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they don't really have a mascot.

260
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:46,356
[SPEAKER_03]: They have giant crabs, I guess.

261
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:48,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Giant crabs could be the mascot.

262
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:51,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

263
00:16:57,628 --> 00:17:00,390
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX Live Arcade is coming to the retailers!

264
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:44,862
[SPEAKER_03]: and Casual Games would extend the 360's appeal to non-hardcore audiences and also those people that and I don't know why people don't have broadband yet but the people that don't have broadband can't download them but ironically enough

265
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:52,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Information arrived to me this week, saying that actually this is going to be happening sooner than later.

266
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,593
[SPEAKER_03]: There is going to be a game coming out in September called the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged.

267
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:13,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it's going to contain is a few games, including Geometry Wars, Texas Hold'em, which is supposed to be coming out in July, I think, Wick, Bejeweled 2, Outpost's Cloaky X, Hardwood Backgammon, which I don't believe is out yet, and

268
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,363
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Badgammon is on the marketplace, I'm pretty sure.

269
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearts and Badgammon, I'm pretty sure, like the hardwood games or whatever.

270
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:29,532
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll also come with a free month of gold, which they include with almost every game nowadays, and 100 free Microsoft points.

271
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:32,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can download some crappy icons.

272
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's about what 100 points will buy you.

273
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:35,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

274
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,160
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's coming, and it's supposed to retail for about $39.99 for the whole package.

275
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:48,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty sweet if you don't have access to broadband and live and stuff.

276
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:50,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I don't know.

277
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see them doing this later on and stuff with maybe some more games and stuff.

278
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:59,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you said the information came to you.

279
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,568
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get this?

280
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:04,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Anonymous tip or were you listening in a top secret board meeting?

281
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:11,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I saw on Joystick when they ran the article, I saw that there was a little addendum and they said, thanks for the tip, Loki.

282
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:11,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like...

283
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:12,901
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

284
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,142
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Loki doing?

285
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:44,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I look every day at least like four or five times a day for new information.

286
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:50,152
[SPEAKER_04]: That surprises me that the mainstream gaming press doesn't have their nose in retail somehow.

287
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:51,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they do.

288
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:55,480
[SPEAKER_04]: They watch their Best Buy release dates and how awfully long those are.

289
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, that's so interesting.

290
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:03,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, Xbox Live, one thing they're definitely looking forward to over on Xbox Live is Luminous.

291
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:09,794
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting about this, though, you know, we've talked a little bit about Luminous and how it's supposed to be one of the more expensive Xbox Live arcade games.

292
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:12,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to go for 1,200 Microsoft points or $15.

293
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:19,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this, supposedly, it's not going to have Xbox Live multiplayer on it by default.

294
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on is Tetsuya Mitsugushi, who created the game, he actually detailed some plans where he's saying that the multiplayer support is going to be an add-on that's separately buyable.

295
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they have not finalized the decision on that.

296
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:44,178
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, that's basically saying that, okay, even though you're spending $15 on the game, it's not gonna be multiplayer unless you spend a little more money.

297
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:51,281
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, also, you're gonna have to do licensed music, backgrounds, that's all gonna be premium downloads as well.

298
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:52,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hmm.

299
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:59,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, now, an interesting comparison's been made where, if you think about it, Luminous, when it first came out on the PSP, was $40.

300
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So this makes this whole Luminous Live thing look like a real deal, but, uh,

301
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:05,966
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

302
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,348
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

303
00:21:56,463 --> 00:22:07,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think, you know, if the creators of this game wanted to they could probably get away with releasing this as an over-the-counter title in the nice little clamshell and everything for $39.99.

304
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:18,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they release these games all the time, especially early on in a console's life period, where the game takes up very little space on the disc.

305
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about the first PlayStation 2 games.

306
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,041
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all on CD.

307
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,001
[SPEAKER_04]: They barely took up any space at all.

308
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:26,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the creators of this game wanted to, they didn't have to sell it on arcade.

309
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:30,284
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably could have done an in-store release for $40 and gotten away with it.

310
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:38,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bet you anything they do that too, just like because now we're seeing it with, you know, the thing you were talking about where they have the arcade titles coming out.

311
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:40,667
[SPEAKER_04]: for retail for those folks who aren't plugged in.

312
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bet you anything, Luminous does come out that way as well.

313
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:51,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But, and only kind of when I put it in that light where it's, well, at least you're not paying 40 bucks for the clamshell, am I not pissed off about this.

314
00:22:51,273 --> 00:23:00,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you also get the games like Call of Duty 2 that released, you know, the game of your edition, which just basically has the game and the downloadable content for it on there.

315
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:03,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they re-skew it as something new.

316
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

317
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

318
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:07,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of,

319
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting way of, you know, selling things.

320
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:13,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

321
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Funnydale says, So, what are you telling me?

322
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:21,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a game that costs $20 on the PSP is going to cost me $200 to play the full version on Xbox Live?

323
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:23,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know about $200.

324
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:24,274
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a little extreme.

325
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: But by the time all these micropayments and, you know, multiplayer and extra skins and stuff add up, yeah, you're probably looking at about $40, which is what the original game would have cost you on the PSP.

326
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:52,044
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I kind of go back to that scenario, you know, they could get away with... If they had never said this was going to be on arcade, if they just said Luminous is coming out for the Xbox 360, I don't think people would have batted an eye at a $40 price tag for it, because that's what all the other games cost.

327
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:57,346
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, and I would still be kind of pissed off about it, is that they didn't really do anything with...

328
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:00,682
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics and stuff, it's not improved in any way.

329
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:02,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a port.

330
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: From what we saw of Luminous 2 at E3, not a damn thing's changed there either.

331
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:07,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

332
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:11,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that was just an early announcement build or something.

333
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:14,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so, because that would be very disappointing.

334
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:25,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous is a fantastic game, and I hope they're not going to screw the series by milking it without giving us something new with it.

335
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:26,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

336
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:27,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's kind of what happened with Tetris.

337
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:30,666
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why Tetris kind of went downhill for a long time.

338
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:38,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, it's had a resurgence a couple times, Tetris DS being the latest one, but there was a while there where we were just all burned out on Tetris, right?

339
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:43,156
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of see Tetris on the shelf, you go, oh, goody, another Tetris clone, right?

340
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:43,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

341
00:24:43,976 --> 00:24:52,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of live games, the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged wasn't the only thing that I heard about that was coming out.

342
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:55,065
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually got updates on all of the Xbox...

343
00:24:56,132 --> 00:25:19,263
[SPEAKER_03]: 360 accessories so they're going to be coming out including Xbox Live Vision which we now have a date which is supposed to be September 20th around there you know it shouldn't change too much I can confirm though it is going to be coming with Uno bundled in there as well as yet again a one month trial to Xbox Live Gold and a headset is going to be packaged with that as well

344
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will be getting the nice little camera and all that other fun stuff.

345
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:27,915
[SPEAKER_03]: What's also cool is the camera can work with your PC, which I think is really neat also.

346
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,757
[SPEAKER_03]: No price yet on that though.

347
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:39,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Also going to be coming out in November on the 15th so far is the 256 megabyte memory unit.

348
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:42,424
[SPEAKER_03]: No price on that yet either, but of course...

349
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:44,349
[SPEAKER_03]: for the Xbox 360.

350
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also know...

351
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:13,778
[SPEAKER_03]: that the HD DVD player is supposed to be coming out around that same time too.

352
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:18,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good stuff.

353
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:21,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Go into our chat room, orangelunchradio.com, click on chat.

354
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,381
[SPEAKER_04]: GK128 says, Bastards already bought Uno.

355
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:25,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that's the way most of us feel.

356
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:27,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

357
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:30,102
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we get if we already have Uno?

358
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to give us some points?

359
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:33,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They should just give us Microsoft points.

360
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:37,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just going to be a sucker type thing.

361
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:37,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucker.

362
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:41,203
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to play for all these months before the game came out on shelves.

363
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:45,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised they don't sell the live arcade games in stores.

364
00:26:46,244 --> 00:27:00,108
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, when I bought my live 12-month kit that came with the headset, because I bought a core system and I didn't have a headset, which I never really used a headset either, but it came with Bank Shop Billiards 2.

365
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:05,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just one of those cards that you pull the tab off and it has a code on it and you redeem it for a game.

366
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised they don't sell those in the stores.

367
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:18,928
[SPEAKER_04]: My all thought was that the reason why they did it that way is because they're bypassing retail when they sell it on Xbox Live Arcade and that's how they can get away with doing it so cheap.

368
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:21,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, $5 for Geometry Wars, that's a freaking steal.

369
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:32,553
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had released that game through a retailer, you would have had so many people to go through that want a bite of the money coming from the consumer, they would not be able to sell that game for $5.

370
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:35,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been at least $20, if not more.

371
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of why I always felt that

372
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:40,470
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live Arcade

373
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:18,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Various games, Half-Life 2, Sin episodes, Darwinia, things like that Downloadable content, they can offer it for cheaper And in some cases a lot easier than just going to the store Okay

374
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:23,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also something that could be coming out for the 360.

375
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:26,168
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know if this is going to be for sure yet.

376
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:28,789
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this is kind of interesting.

377
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:32,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Peter Moore recently gave an interview on another podcast.

378
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:33,291
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about these guys before.

379
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:33,752
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty cool.

380
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:34,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamertag Radio.

381
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:36,373
[SPEAKER_04]: They snagged Peter Moore.

382
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:36,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky guys.

383
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:47,698
[SPEAKER_04]: When Peter Moore was on that station, he was saying that shoulder buttons, triggers, analog sticks, D-pads, there's a lot going on when you compare it to an Atari 2600 button and stick.

384
00:28:50,173 --> 00:29:01,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically what he's saying is that he's imagining that he's kind of insinuating that they're going to be doing a simpler controller, basically with the Xbox Live Arcade downloads in mind.

385
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:09,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you think about a lot of those Xbox Live Arcade downloads, Uno, Geometry Wars, you don't really use a lot of the buttons on the Xbox 360 controller.

386
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:14,826
[SPEAKER_04]: They could get away with releasing a controller with one or two buttons, and most of the games would support that there.

387
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:18,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, nothing is being confirmed by Microsoft directly,

388
00:29:18,988 --> 00:29:23,190
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're basically saying that, yeah, we're going to continue to innovate wherever we can.

389
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,310
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, it's kind of interesting when Peter Moore says this.

390
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,011
[SPEAKER_04]: You know he's in the know of what's going on at Microsoft.

391
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:28,972
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so stupid.

392
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:30,232
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

393
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:30,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

394
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:34,374
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're buying a 360, you obviously know how to use a controller anyways.

395
00:29:34,994 --> 00:29:35,454
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

396
00:29:35,494 --> 00:29:38,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all the other games you're playing use the entire controller.

397
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:43,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should be familiar enough with it to all of a sudden become retarded when you start playing an Xbox Live Arcade game.

398
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:48,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't tell me you're just buying the system to play those Live Arcade games because that's even more retarded.

399
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:54,301
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the whole trying to make the system accessible to people who aren't the hardcore gamers?

400
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:58,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know quite a few people would probably think the idea of playing UNO is kind of cool.

401
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,384
[SPEAKER_03]: That aren't the hardcore gamers.

402
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:03,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to be buying a 360 to play UNO?

403
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:09,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't tell me that they're actually going to go spend $400 on a system to play UNO.

404
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:10,708
[SPEAKER_00]: UNO!

405
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:16,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if they need something so simple, they can just go to Walmart and buy a UNO deck.

406
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing, too, is they don't have to use the analog sticks.

407
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:24,170
[SPEAKER_03]: That's way too complex, you know, using an analog nub on there.

408
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,552
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and most of the games anyways are about one or two buttons.

409
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like they have to remember which button they have to push.

410
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:33,414
[SPEAKER_04]: What about in trying to justify it as a family purchase?

411
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:34,354
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that, you know...

412
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,195
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

413
00:30:59,562 --> 00:31:00,502
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

414
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:17,694
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

415
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you this much, buying accessories for a 360, it's expensive as it is.

416
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Each one of those controllers is about 50 bucks.

417
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:49,645
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I think you should be fine with just the one controller.

418
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:54,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, again, Devil's Advocate, why then do they sell DVD remotes separately?

419
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:57,289
[SPEAKER_04]: For like PlayStation 2, you don't need it.

420
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well the reason why they sell those separately is sometimes those DVD remotes have features that you can't normally do, like angle change and all that stuff.

421
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:09,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally you can pull up all that on the PlayStation, you just have to know your way around the menus.

422
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can do it through menus, but why bother doing it through menus when you have dedicated buttons for that?

423
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,461
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say, you know... That's for the convenience of the consumer.

424
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is for the convenience.

425
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:20,203
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing, though.

426
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:23,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still convenient to use the same buttons on there.

427
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:25,086
[SPEAKER_03]: They have triggers and analog sticks.

428
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:26,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how hard is it?

429
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:28,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I can't figure out the buttons.

430
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:30,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty simplified.

431
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:32,970
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

432
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we welcome your feedback on this issue.

433
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:36,632
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always send us an email.

434
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:38,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

435
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:42,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we'll open up the Skype line a little later on in the program.

436
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:53,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I suppose they can, you know, save some money, you know, especially since, you know, the 360 is supposedly going to, well, the rumor is going around that it's supposed to drop in price around Christmas.

437
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a big bunch of crap, if you ask me.

438
00:32:57,731 --> 00:33:04,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you know, this has been going back and forth, you know, people saying, oh, yeah, it's going to drop, you know, we heard it from such and such person.

439
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:10,614
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to drop $100 to make it look, you know, more enticing for people, you know, not to buy the Wii and stuff.

440
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:16,493
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, again, at the same time, you know, why do they need to drop the price when the PS3 is, you know, $600?

441
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:21,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to drop, and if I remember correctly, I think Peter Moore actually said, no, they're not dropping the price of the system.

442
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's saying that the price is going to drop?

443
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just internet rumor in general?

444
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:29,589
[SPEAKER_03]: A source close to Microsoft.

445
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:33,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Nobody, basically saying that it's going to drop.

446
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:38,094
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of a friend's cousin's brother's uncle's.

447
00:33:38,194 --> 00:33:42,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, who probably works in the help center and is an expert on everything.

448
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:46,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to drop.

449
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:49,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually see a small price cut reasonable.

450
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:55,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think like $100, but I could see like maybe they throw in a game, like a cheapy game.

451
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:56,016
[SPEAKER_04]: A bundle.

452
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:59,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or they cut it by $20, $40, maybe $50.

453
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,739
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems a lot more possible, especially around the holidays.

454
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:06,140
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems feasible, like Forza 2 and the 360.

455
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that happening.

456
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,022
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes more sense because you spend the money on the game system.

457
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:13,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to have something to play on Christmas morning.

458
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:18,038
[SPEAKER_03]: There, that makes more sense than dropping the price of the system $100.

459
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't think that's going to happen.

460
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:24,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Going over to our chat room, Jada2006 says, I laugh.

461
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone actually named Joe Nobody is listening.

462
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:32,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe there's somebody he knows who's actually named Joe Nobody.

463
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:32,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Loki.

464
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, if the Wii launches at $250, then the 360 price will drop to $250 and $350.

465
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:43,784
[SPEAKER_04]: He seems pretty convinced that that drop would happen to be competitive with the Wii.

466
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:47,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, HitStun has a question.

467
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:49,467
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, how much is an original Xbox now?

468
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:49,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it still $199?

469
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:52,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

470
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't they $179?

471
00:34:54,855 --> 00:34:55,935
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cheaper than that.

472
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:57,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's around $150, if not $99.

473
00:34:58,157 --> 00:34:59,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's supposed to drop to $99.

474
00:34:59,378 --> 00:35:03,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see them doing that to compete with the PlayStation 2.

475
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I will research very quickly here while we move on to some other stories.

476
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:12,649
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something you can do with the money that you're saving on an Xbox 360 if they do drop the price.

477
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:13,750
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

478
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy porn?

479
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:16,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that too.

480
00:35:16,793 --> 00:35:17,814
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend $25,000 on a Game Boy.

481
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

482
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:53,413
[SPEAKER_04]: This sushi place was crazy.

483
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,935
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a couple of them that were $100,000.

484
00:35:55,975 --> 00:35:56,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

485
00:35:57,036 --> 00:35:59,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know which restaurant I'm going to knock off if I'm going to go.

486
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:03,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, this restaurant carries diamonds.

487
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:04,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going there.

488
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:08,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you complain if you get it for free.

489
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:11,287
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically you have this equivalent of Game Boys.

490
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:15,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a $25,000 Game Boy put out by Swiss Supply Direct.

491
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:19,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Figures a Swiss would come up with something crazy like this.

492
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:20,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's my turn.

493
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,172
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we might have listeners there, jackass.

494
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:29,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it has a diamond set on the display screen.

495
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:32,820
[SPEAKER_00]: It has diamond off-on buttons.

496
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,726
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the original cables, extra game cartridges, a blue leather display case.

497
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:42,188
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made out of solid 18-karat gold.

498
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:46,752
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, does it have a knife and a corkscrew in it as well?

499
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:48,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, you know.

500
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:58,390
[SPEAKER_00]: But it weighs 27 ounces, it's supposed to be, you know, the price is supposed to be just, like, right on, you know, cost of material and sale.

501
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,332
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, and the thing is, is that it's not even, like, a cool Game Boy, it's like an old Game Boy.

502
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:06,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, it's not even a fucking DS or a GBA or a Micro?

503
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:08,855
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a freaking Game Boy.

504
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:09,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Game Brick.

505
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:10,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

506
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:12,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't they just do, like, a Game Boy Micro?

507
00:37:12,557 --> 00:37:14,578
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have spent less money on it, and then...

508
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music

509
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:38,889
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

510
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:03,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, you should play my new game, Diamond Quest.

511
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:05,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be on my $25,000 Swiss game wine.

512
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:12,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw that they renamed that game to Diamond Quest so that she didn't look like a complete idiot.

513
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:14,896
[SPEAKER_03]: They should rename it to Stupid Spoiled Whores Game.

514
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid Spoiled Whore the Game.

515
00:38:19,938 --> 00:38:20,818
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I hate her.

516
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry, we do that once in a while.

517
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:29,238
[SPEAKER_04]: The four years of Orange Lounge Radio, we've actually slipped into Paris Hilton's chat a couple times.

518
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:29,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

519
00:38:29,899 --> 00:38:30,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps coming back to her.

520
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:32,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scary.

521
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Go way off topic here again.

522
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help it, but I've actually caught some of the third season of The Simple Life.

523
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:43,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And that show is basically like...

524
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:56,710
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were the husband in any one of those situations, I would be getting my ass handed to me because they get them in so much trouble and then their wives basically just rip into them.

525
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like basically... Excuse me, I have a question.

526
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:00,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a video game?

527
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:01,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

528
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting to that.

529
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:04,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

530
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:05,614
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually I'm not.

531
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:09,316
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um... Okay, completely off topic there.

532
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:09,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

533
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:13,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of talked about something that we talked about last week.

534
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Louisiana and their game laws.

535
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:21,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically the one where they were going to be fining the hell out of retailers for selling indecent stuff.

536
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:23,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a couple things have happened.

537
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:28,863
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, Judge has actually gotten the law temporarily blocked.

538
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:37,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, of course, this is all the ESA is doing as far as being able to

539
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:45,135
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESEA and EMA have filed suit last Friday to overturn the law.

540
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:57,245
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the court filings later that day, a federal judge, James J. Brady, granted the trade group's request for a temporary restraining order preventing the law from being enforced.

541
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:04,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the three reasons why they... It's very...

542
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:12,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Controversial and goes against a lot of the First Amendment and I think goes the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.

543
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:22,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically the ESA's comment on this was, not only does the act directly restrict the decimation and receipt of considerable amounts

544
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,884
[SPEAKER_03]: A fully protected expression.

545
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:45,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of its numerous vague terms, the act also creates a chilling effect on a great deal of speech as video game creators, publishers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers will respond to the act's uncertainty by self-censoring, depriving both adults and children access of undeniably protected expression.

546
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what they're saying is, you know,

547
00:40:49,122 --> 00:40:50,623
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly is obscene?

548
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:53,524
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing really defining it in this.

549
00:40:53,745 --> 00:41:00,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, because of this, game publishers and companies will have to start self-censoring the games.

550
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:02,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's never good.

551
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:14,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So on top of that, though, the Louisiana governor has a second bill that's gone in place, which I actually kind of like this one.

552
00:41:16,204 --> 00:41:39,152
[SPEAKER_03]: basically add games to lists of media that can be harmful to minors and the ESA is actually for this one and what it's supposed to do is basically just kind of give actual guidelines to what is obscene and basically not meant for kids.

553
00:41:39,212 --> 00:41:42,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like the same loss that the normal

554
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:45,515
[SPEAKER_03]: and other media like TV and movies go by.

555
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:48,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's pretty good.

556
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:50,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one actually got signed into law.

557
00:41:51,118 --> 00:41:51,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's always good.

558
00:41:53,179 --> 00:42:00,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they did the same thing in Maryland actually with that kind of law where basically falls under the obscenity laws.

559
00:42:01,263 --> 00:42:01,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

560
00:42:02,584 --> 00:42:10,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this going off the ESRB or what's going to determine... It's basically they have the guidelines.

561
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:12,249
[SPEAKER_03]: What it is is

562
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:21,609
[SPEAKER_03]: If the material is designed to incite or appeal to the... I hate law terminology.

563
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:23,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so stupid.

564
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, it's basically if it's obscenely offensive.

565
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:34,457
[SPEAKER_03]: If the game is Baby Raper 2000 or something like that, that's not going to be... They'll have the right to pull that off the shelves.

566
00:42:34,857 --> 00:42:38,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I would want to try out Baby Raper 2000 before I start knocking on it, though.

567
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:39,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be interesting.

568
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:43,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding, Jesus, God.

569
00:42:44,085 --> 00:42:44,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway.

570
00:42:45,486 --> 00:42:54,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, it's, you know, if it's harmful to minors, and I think that they're gonna go by the ESRB's, you know, rating system for this.

571
00:42:55,053 --> 00:43:02,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, you know, because, to be honest, they can take laws nowadays and just spin them any way they, you know, benefits them, and

572
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:05,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess if the ESA isn't arguing with it, then I guess I can go for that.

573
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:05,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

574
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:11,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what I think is also pretty ridiculous, though, is that actually the Parents Television Council is actually pretty upset about the...

575
00:43:31,437 --> 00:43:33,478
[SPEAKER_00]: ESRB's commitment to parent campaign.

576
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:47,960
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

577
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got sand in their vagina about it?

578
00:43:50,902 --> 00:44:02,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, Tim Winter, who is the executive director, basically said in his press release, to quote, yet another dodge by the video game industry to avoid accountability for the harm it inflicts on children.

579
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:12,497
[SPEAKER_00]: What they don't seem to understand is that it isn't the industry's job to protect their children.

580
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:15,119
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the parents' job to protect their children.

581
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:30,070
[SPEAKER_00]: by limiting another facility's free speech, they're basically passing on the responsibility that they agreed to as parents to another facility.

582
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:36,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do agree that at a certain age, there are certain things you should not be exposed to.

583
00:44:37,314 --> 00:44:45,178
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you have a child, you accept the responsibility of guarding your children from those things that you don't want them to see.

584
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:52,845
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is just them not wanting to take responsibility for what they need to be doing.

585
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:56,028
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to put the blame on somebody else instead of their own failures.

586
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:57,489
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I see it.

587
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to get that guy on this program.

588
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:02,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so would I. We should send an email.

589
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:04,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should.

590
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:05,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for it.

591
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you work on it?

592
00:45:07,797 --> 00:45:08,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I will work on trying to get him on.

593
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like how I passed the buck there?

594
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:12,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll table it for future discussion.

595
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what happens when we get pissed off?

596
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:29,781
[SPEAKER_04]: People die.

597
00:45:56,892 --> 00:46:00,133
[SPEAKER_04]: and the FUs of the week are brought upon us.

598
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:01,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I must destroy them all.

599
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:20,218
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my FU of the week goes toward the stupid drunk girl from last night.

600
00:46:20,298 --> 00:46:25,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I took my friend Julie to Berkeley yesterday for her birthday.

601
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:30,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, because I wasn't going to get to hang out with her tonight for her birthday party.

602
00:46:31,618 --> 00:46:32,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a good time.

603
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:40,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really, really worn out and tired, you know, on the way home, so I dropped Julie off and rested for a little bit at her house so that I'd have enough energy to get home.

604
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:52,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was approaching one of the major intersections, for anybody who's in the Sacramento area or who has been here, is when you're going down White Avenue toward the interstate on-ramp

605
00:46:54,454 --> 00:47:01,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before Marconi, basically this girl, I was in the far left lane, there was a lane between us, and there was a girl in the far right lane ahead of me.

606
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:05,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And she suddenly spins out of control in her little Mini Cooper.

607
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And spun right and then swerved around left and just went into a full 360 in the middle of the road.

608
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And was heading directly for me.

609
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:22,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw on my brakes and swerved and she did the same and we actually avoided a head-on collision by less than four inches.

610
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:26,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, it was pretty scary.

611
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:30,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh... Did your whole life flash before your eyes and all that stuff?

612
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:32,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my brain shut down.

613
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:37,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so... I was tired already, you know, but I was good to get home.

614
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:48,082
[SPEAKER_00]: This just had my adrenaline going so bad, which actually I'm supposed to avoid, you know, by my doctor's orders, but... Anyway, I pulled up ahead, I watched from my rearview mirror to see what was going on.

615
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:54,530
[SPEAKER_00]: She turned around and started heading out, so I just decided to go home because I was too shaken up by it.

616
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, I had headlights flashed in my eyes.

617
00:47:57,893 --> 00:47:58,794
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty scary.

618
00:47:59,054 --> 00:48:01,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't let this comment in chat go by, Jamie.

619
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:03,097
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to hear this one.

620
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, Jamie, you have a lot of close calls in traffic.

621
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you're actually the one that's a bad driver.

622
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:09,282
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

623
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:10,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.

624
00:48:10,683 --> 00:48:14,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the one who drives drunk, who spins out in the middle of the road.

625
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the one who bumped into a couple other cars.

626
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:23,440
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was actually my good driving that saved my life.

627
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Only when she's playing Mario Kart is she a bad driver.

628
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:26,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't play Mario Kart.

629
00:48:27,325 --> 00:48:27,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever.

630
00:48:27,745 --> 00:48:28,747
[SPEAKER_04]: What driving games do you play?

631
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:29,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you play any driving games?

632
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:30,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Racer.

633
00:48:30,649 --> 00:48:31,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Red Racer, okay.

634
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:32,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you play Mario Kart?

635
00:48:32,732 --> 00:48:33,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

636
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:45,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I got up to one of the lights a few blocks up, and a guy in a Camaro who I knew was a little bit behind me in the other lane pulled up and said, hey, what happened, what happened?

637
00:48:46,188 --> 00:48:48,389
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she pulled up next to him, so he just turned and talked to her.

638
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:49,550
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what were you thinking?

639
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:50,330
[SPEAKER_00]: What was going on?

640
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:50,930
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong?

641
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,051
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I just want to go home.

642
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:57,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I just want to go home.

643
00:48:58,032 --> 00:49:00,733
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, by the way, exactly what she sounded like, I'm not joking.

644
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:02,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, are you drunk?

645
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:04,815
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, no, yeah, a little.

646
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:11,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, DarkSakura, Fireboma and Chad is backing you up, saying it's because she lives in California, kids.

647
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:13,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously?

648
00:49:13,538 --> 00:49:15,438
[SPEAKER_04]: People here can't drive, they really can't.

649
00:49:15,638 --> 00:49:17,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor can they in certain parts of Georgia.

650
00:49:18,146 --> 00:49:18,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that right, Bobby?

651
00:49:18,866 --> 00:49:20,587
[SPEAKER_00]: If he's listening.

652
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby had to leave, but he was listening.

653
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:33,471
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I should have stopped and got her license plate number, but honestly, I was like, I'm getting away from her, and just shot up onto the freeway and went home.

654
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:36,772
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was seriously really scary.

655
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:41,234
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why, you know, you've got the, oh, don't drink and drive, blah, blah, blah, blah.

656
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:42,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, don't do it.

657
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:43,995
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, you're a fucking retard.

658
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:47,456
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have... It takes...

659
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:57,674
[SPEAKER_00]: For, I think, a double shot of liquor, depending on your metabolism too, by the way, but for a double shot of liquor, it takes about three hours to get it fully out of your system.

660
00:49:57,734 --> 00:49:58,995
[SPEAKER_00]: For a beer, it's about the same.

661
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:03,557
[SPEAKER_00]: She, her eyes were so dilated, it wasn't funny.

662
00:50:03,677 --> 00:50:06,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see from, you know, two lanes over.

663
00:50:07,378 --> 00:50:09,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Marin in chat says, she plays Derby Owners Club.

664
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,500
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like driving, right guys?

665
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys?

666
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I've beaten my horse.

667
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:14,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

668
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:15,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but,

669
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:16,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck her!

670
00:50:16,754 --> 00:50:22,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody who drives drunk, a big, humongous, horkin' fuck you.

671
00:50:22,237 --> 00:50:23,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you get arrested.

672
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:24,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

673
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:25,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

674
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:41,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I kinda have, I just, you know, her whole story reminds me of the time that I was driving, don't ask me why, to play DDR at like midnight over at, you know, CCL, you know, Country Club Lanes, the ultra ghetto bowling alley that had DDR bits up in 24 hours a day.

675
00:50:41,826 --> 00:50:42,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, that was a long time ago.

676
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:54,775
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's this guy who was in a van who, um, swerved across all the traffic and swerved back over and went on the off-ramp, but except for making the turn for the off-ramp, just kind of jumped over the lane and kind of drove off-road for a little bit.

677
00:50:55,315 --> 00:50:55,856
[SPEAKER_03]: That was funny.

678
00:50:56,376 --> 00:51:00,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was like, I'm all, man, that guy's, like, not really, you know, paying attention to where he's going.

679
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, whoa, oh, he just went over the edge.

680
00:51:02,681 --> 00:51:03,181
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was funny.

681
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, okay.

682
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:05,663
[SPEAKER_03]: On to our views.

683
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:08,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, fuck you, stupid 24-hour fitness...

684
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:12,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I went and signed up.

685
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:21,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, this is how every single place is, where they have your sign-up fee or whatever, and then they have a processing fee of like $70.

686
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,187
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly are they doing for that $70?

687
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:32,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I saw her process the account and basically type it into a computer for about one minute.

688
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was $77 worth of work right there?

689
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

690
00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:39,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, for $77, she needs to learn how to type.

691
00:51:42,585 --> 00:51:46,186
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU goes to that great big ball of fire in the sky, the sun.

692
00:51:46,926 --> 00:51:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to a theme park in the Bay Area called Great America yesterday to kind of celebrate my birthday with some friends.

693
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:55,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And believe me, I'm not stupid.

694
00:51:55,887 --> 00:51:59,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I put sunscreen like all over, all over, you know.

695
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:02,608
[SPEAKER_04]: There's SPF 60 because I want to make sure I wasn't going to get burned up.

696
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:07,549
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it didn't really occur to me that, oh, Rob, you have spiky hair now.

697
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:11,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You should probably put some sunblock on your scalp.

698
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:20,504
[SPEAKER_04]: because basically what I ended up with is a sunburned scalp and you can see a little bit of the redness there here in studio where basically the top of my head got sunburned.

699
00:52:21,265 --> 00:52:23,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So F you to the sun for burning people.

700
00:52:23,346 --> 00:52:26,027
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a nice thing to do to the creatures of the earth.

701
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:29,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Magus, we'll give you one quick F you if you got one.

702
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:35,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is not normally something I F you but first I'm going to hear this.

703
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:40,455
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to Blizzard in the 1.11 patch which just came out

704
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:52,314
[SPEAKER_02]: On Tuesday, they added new content, Nexramus, that kind of stuff, revamped a lot of things, Mage and Shaman talent reviews, but they made one crucial error.

705
00:52:52,574 --> 00:53:00,119
[SPEAKER_02]: They made the Looking for Group channel global across the entire population of the server.

706
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:07,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild players, if you know Goldshire, if you know Baron's Chat, it's now across the entire server.

707
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:10,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even try to use the LFG channel to LFG.

708
00:53:12,425 --> 00:53:17,609
[SPEAKER_02]: See, they had failed to take into account how utterly stupid 95% of their player base is.

709
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:24,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I wondered why that channel was freaking off the charts in chat.

710
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:32,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, there cannot be this many people looking for, like, you know, Ragefire Chasm and Deadmines in Silver Pine Forest.

711
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what the hell is wrong?

712
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:36,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that makes sense.

713
00:53:36,182 --> 00:53:37,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that was stupid of Blizzard.

714
00:53:38,623 --> 00:53:39,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, guys.

715
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,366
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, wow, that was like our longest FU segment ever.

716
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:42,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, guys.

717
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:48,672
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I wanted to say real quick before we get back into the news.

718
00:53:49,253 --> 00:53:53,076
[SPEAKER_04]: To follow up to the chat question earlier, how much does an original Xbox cost?

719
00:53:53,457 --> 00:53:54,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the weird thing.

720
00:53:54,257 --> 00:53:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone to like five different sites.

721
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not able to find a new Xbox.

722
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:01,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they stop making them and I just forgot they did?

723
00:54:01,645 --> 00:54:01,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

724
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:03,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, wow.

725
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:05,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess then here's the deal.

726
00:54:05,428 --> 00:54:08,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get them on GameStop.com and I imagine EB as well.

727
00:54:08,891 --> 00:54:13,335
[SPEAKER_04]: A refurb system is $99 for most of the used ones.

728
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,976
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a factory refurb for $129.99.

729
00:54:15,216 --> 00:54:21,061
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like if you want a new one from Microsoft themselves, tough poop.

730
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:23,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Tough poopy.

731
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:27,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

732
00:54:27,386 --> 00:54:30,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so yeah, that kind of sucks.

733
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:32,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Need for Speed Carbon, which, um,

734
00:54:44,725 --> 00:54:47,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Need for Speed Carbon Copy Need for Speed Carbon Copy

735
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:16,631
[SPEAKER_03]: You will fly over the edge and die!

736
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the soundtrack to that game.

737
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:10,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how the commercials for that totally spoiled the after credits ending thing.

738
00:56:33,787 --> 00:56:36,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even bother to... I could care less, Loki.

739
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I could care less about that movie.

740
00:56:37,971 --> 00:56:38,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, sorry.

741
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:56,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to cleanse the palate of drifting, we actually have some confirmation by Uchiyama Daisuke, who is Namco Bandai's chief producer, stating that there will be both Tekken and Soul Calibur games being worked on...

742
00:56:57,697 --> 00:57:06,679
[SPEAKER_00]: on the... Well, they're not saying specifically what system it's going to be on, but we are going to get a new Soul Calibur, a new Tekken, and the guess is that it will be PS3.

743
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:14,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially since there was already some sort of tech demo for Tekken on PS3 already.

744
00:57:15,061 --> 00:57:15,461
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

745
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:18,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I soon remember something at Sony's press conference, too, about that whole thing.

746
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:25,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And Soul Calibur 3 was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so that would seem to indicate maybe it'll continue, but...

747
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:28,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Pantsless Pope Pantsless Pope

748
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:45,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Calibur II Soul Calibur III

749
00:58:03,704 --> 00:58:08,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Calibur 2 is just much more of a big release than Soul Calibur 3.

750
00:58:08,387 --> 00:58:14,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hoping that Soul Calibur 4 can maybe live up to that bar that Soul Calibur 2 set.

751
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:19,152
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to say that Soul Calibur 3 didn't live up to the bar, but in some ways it didn't.

752
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:26,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it was a great game, it wasn't a... When I look back in 15 years, I'm going to remember this next to Soul Calibur 2 type game.

753
00:58:27,577 --> 00:58:27,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

754
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:28,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you guys feel differently.

755
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:29,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you, chat room?

756
00:58:29,898 --> 00:58:30,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

757
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

758
00:58:32,352 --> 00:58:36,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Soul Calibur, I don't know, I think Soul Calibur 3 didn't do as well as 2.

759
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:44,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the fact when you release something on one system as opposed to 3, you're obviously going to get less sales.

760
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:49,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, of course, we have the chat room is lighting up with some feedback there, which is what I was hoping here.

761
00:58:50,562 --> 00:58:53,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, Link on Soul Calibur 2 rocked my socks.

762
00:58:53,863 --> 00:59:01,827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one reason many people are going to remember Soul Calibur 2 was the addition of Link, which seemed so random at the time, but just was awesome for the GameCube owners.

763
00:59:02,687 --> 00:59:04,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Bandit says, you know what?

764
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:05,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Tekken is so much better than Soul Calibur.

765
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:08,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's more excited about the Tekken game that's coming out on PS3.

766
00:59:09,411 --> 00:59:12,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dark Knight says, hey, what about the original Soul Edge game?

767
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:12,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Castelvania

768
00:59:37,295 --> 00:59:44,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any other Castlevania game they ever released will come close to the greatness of Symphony of the Night.

769
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more so than the original, for me.

770
00:59:46,781 --> 00:59:52,225
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know, that's kind of how I feel about Soul Calibur, but I'm sure you guys feel differently, but we've all got opinions.

771
00:59:53,346 --> 00:59:57,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, another game that had tons and tons and tons of sequels was King's Quest.

772
00:59:58,049 --> 00:59:59,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember this whole game, King's Quest?

773
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:06,873
[SPEAKER_04]: on the PC years ago, Roberta Williams, King Quest, and they had 5 and 6 for some of the first games on CD-ROM.

774
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:17,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they went back, Sierra, and they remade 1 and 2 a while ago, and they gave them fancy VGA graphics, but one game they never really went back and upgraded that much was King's Quest 3.

775
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:27,001
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's happened is that the fans, and you remember a while back when we even had some of the King's Quest fan community on here, and they were making like the

776
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:28,763
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fan Game in the series.

777
01:00:28,783 --> 01:00:32,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, King's Quest fans are passionate about these games.

778
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:33,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And this just goes to prove it.

779
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:37,016
[SPEAKER_04]: King's Quest 3, to air as human, has been remade.

780
01:00:37,788 --> 01:00:54,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been remade by Infamous Adventures, and this remake features all new VGA backgrounds, enhanced close-up cutscenes, dialogue portraits for all the characters, original music by a professional composer, a full speech pack, and a new point-and-click interface.

781
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:02,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, Infamous Adventures believes this game is still relevant, and no profit is being made off the game.

782
01:01:03,105 --> 01:01:05,147
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download it free of charge for...

783
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:08,310
[SPEAKER_04]: 43.2 megabytes is how big the game is.

784
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:18,653
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at infamous-adventures.com And honestly, guys, if you don't have GameTap, because GameTap has a lot of King's Quest games in there, I would highly recommend you guys check this out.

785
01:01:19,814 --> 01:01:21,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to assume it's like the original.

786
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:23,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a chance to check it out myself yet.

787
01:01:23,335 --> 01:01:23,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to.

788
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:29,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I would highly recommend you download it as quick as possible because it'll probably be pulled off by some copywriter.

789
01:01:29,737 --> 01:01:33,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now that one person's downloaded it, it'll forever be floating in the internet somewhere.

790
01:01:34,331 --> 01:01:36,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, check this out.

791
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:37,873
[SPEAKER_04]: King's Quest was a great series of games.

792
01:01:38,794 --> 01:01:39,974
[SPEAKER_00]: King's Quest was pretty cool.

793
01:01:40,014 --> 01:01:44,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, I couldn't get into it too much, but I think I want to play Peasant's Quest.

794
01:01:45,557 --> 01:01:46,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Peasant's Quest?

795
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:47,578
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

796
01:01:47,878 --> 01:01:49,619
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Homestar Runner site.

797
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:49,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

798
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,421
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, actually, I... Damn you, Chogdor!

799
01:01:53,681 --> 01:02:00,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the easiest one to get into out of the series, and I don't know, King's Quest hardcore fans may disagree with me, but I think King's Quest 4...

800
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:05,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually tried to start with King's Quest 5 and I couldn't get into it.

801
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:05,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

802
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:06,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And Magus, you're saying 5.

803
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:07,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

804
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:14,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying 5 because I got started on the series on NES and it was the first King's Quest release that I got to play.

805
01:02:15,657 --> 01:02:21,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I didn't really get into it past 5, but I did get to go into the previous games a little bit.

806
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to start on 5, so I think it was the easiest for me.

807
01:02:27,648 --> 01:02:30,149
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, going to the chat room for some quick feedback before we move on here.

808
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:36,290
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPower says, I'd like to point out that while Sierra did remake KQ1, it was a total market failure.

809
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,511
[SPEAKER_04]: AGD took over the reins of remaking it, and for free.

810
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:41,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's kind of an interesting point there.

811
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Sierra had a couple of their old games remade back in the day.

812
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:46,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let's see.

813
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:50,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks, SexyStalker is commenting, shameless game tap plug.

814
01:02:51,138 --> 01:02:52,880
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't pay us.

815
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,944
[SPEAKER_04]: We just think they do have a pretty interesting service, but it's really up to you guys if you want it or not.

816
01:02:57,364 --> 01:03:01,288
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Gamerman55 in chat says, Sky, we want some real news, not old games.

817
01:03:01,768 --> 01:03:02,469
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

818
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:09,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, yes, this is an old game, I think this speaks more volumes about what fan communities in the gaming world are capable of doing.

819
01:03:09,876 --> 01:03:14,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is not an easy task to remake a game with graphics.

820
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I sure as hell couldn't program it.

821
01:03:17,392 --> 01:03:23,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is kind of noteworthy when these gaming fan communities go above the Akala fandom.

822
01:03:24,194 --> 01:03:28,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, there has been another remake that's kind of been a little off the radar.

823
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:32,977
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of FPS fans know that

824
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,300
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

825
01:04:03,854 --> 01:04:06,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's loving a game, and then there's loving a game.

826
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these guys love their game.

827
01:04:09,098 --> 01:04:09,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

828
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:09,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I have release dates.

829
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:29,810
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so some non-fan games.

830
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, some of these are fan-ish, I guess.

831
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:34,832
[SPEAKER_04]: These games may have fans very soon.

832
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:43,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, one of the titles surprises me, because I thought you couldn't use Ninja in a title in the UK, but I guess you can.

833
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:46,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out on the 30th, a whole crap load of games.

834
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:48,318
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Shinobi Doei of the Ninja.

835
01:04:49,068 --> 01:05:00,274
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Over G Fighters on Xbox 360, New Super Mario Bros., Micro Machines, Flat Out 2, Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, Def Jam Fight for New York, Brick'em All.

836
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:14,721
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Swords of Destiny, Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror, Titan Quest, Untold Legends, The Warrior Code, and also before that on the 29th is Panzer Command Operation Winter Storm on PC.

837
01:05:16,822 --> 01:05:17,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

838
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:18,643
[SPEAKER_03]: How about in the U.S.? ?

839
01:05:19,392 --> 01:05:30,835
[SPEAKER_03]: US, not a whole lot, but if you're a Pirates of the Caribbean fan and you happen to have a portable console, then you'll be happy to know that Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest has arrived.

840
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I played a little bit of it at E3.

841
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:35,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It is pretty good.

842
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,957
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your typical action game.

843
01:05:39,357 --> 01:05:45,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Micro Machines, though, is coming out on PlayStation 2, Micro Machines Volume 4, as well as the PSP.

844
01:05:46,078 --> 01:05:47,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Are Micro Machines still around?

845
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:48,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

846
01:05:50,222 --> 01:05:51,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Magus is shaking his head no.

847
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:52,444
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game looks fun.

848
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:53,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

849
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:54,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I guess if it's fun, who cares?

850
01:05:55,146 --> 01:05:58,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, Ultimate Ninja for the anime fighting fans.

851
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:09,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, let's see here, Rough Trigger the Vanacore Conspiracy, which is some weird budget game where you play a werewolf.

852
01:06:10,977 --> 01:06:11,438
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

853
01:06:11,618 --> 01:06:18,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there was one 360 game which was Over G Fighters is coming out this week, which is supposed to be kind of like Ace Combat.

854
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,555
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know, not a whole lot.

855
01:06:23,376 --> 01:06:24,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot at all.

856
01:06:24,176 --> 01:06:25,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow period for games, though.

857
01:06:25,337 --> 01:06:26,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Sudoku Gridmaster, that was the other one.

858
01:06:27,438 --> 01:06:28,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoopee!

859
01:06:29,138 --> 01:06:32,340
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's by Nintendo... I don't know.

860
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm burned out on Sudoku.

861
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,022
[SPEAKER_03]: If you own a GameCube, though, nada anything for you.

862
01:06:37,602 --> 01:06:38,642
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck.

863
01:06:40,723 --> 01:06:41,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what your retail says.

864
01:06:43,304 --> 01:06:44,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, you know.

865
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:45,901
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't be all buying this.

866
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:51,405
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that reminds me, I still gotta buy my copy of Crusty Demons so I can come over and play it.

867
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:58,510
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the games I will not be buying is the 10th Anniversary Edition of Tomb Raider because I honestly hate Tomb Raider.

868
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:04,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know what, it is confirmed though, Eidos has come out and said they are remaking the very first Tomb Raider.

869
01:07:04,695 --> 01:07:08,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be arriving on the PlayStation 2, PSP, and PC.

870
01:07:10,499 --> 01:07:13,141
[SPEAKER_03]: No word yet when, but it's coming soon.

871
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:14,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know,

872
01:07:14,978 --> 01:07:16,960
[SPEAKER_03]: for all you fans of Tomb Raider out there.

873
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:21,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but it's coming out soon.

874
01:07:23,526 --> 01:07:27,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, one way that Tomb Raider became ultra-famous was because it had a movie made out of it.

875
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:31,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually movies are made out of famous games.

876
01:07:32,273 --> 01:07:35,977
[SPEAKER_04]: But this game was a little more B-list or C-list even.

877
01:07:35,997 --> 01:07:36,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more of a cult game.

878
01:07:37,038 --> 01:07:37,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Clock Tower.

879
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember Clock Tower?

880
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:40,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Clock Tower was kind of cool because, you know,

881
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:44,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Gory, gory murder and the scissors and all that scary stuff.

882
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:47,548
[SPEAKER_04]: However, what's interesting about it is that it is being made into a movie.

883
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Jorge Oguen is heading up the Clock Tower movie project.

884
01:07:53,432 --> 01:07:58,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what's happening is that the person who wrote When a Stranger Calls is writing a script for this movie.

885
01:07:59,696 --> 01:08:04,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Jason Wade Wall is the name of this guy.

886
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And production is going to start on the Clock Tower movie this fall.

887
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:11,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, the movie will be better than When a Stranger Calls.

888
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:16,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people have to pick all this really non-mainstream stuff to make movies out of?

889
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:18,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

890
01:08:18,769 --> 01:08:21,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's about the source material for some people.

891
01:08:21,491 --> 01:08:26,995
[SPEAKER_04]: If a good movie can be made out of this, and I think it can, I think a real scary movie could be made from this.

892
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:28,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a pretty scary game.

893
01:08:28,736 --> 01:08:30,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only played a little bit of Clock Tower.

894
01:08:31,418 --> 01:08:32,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bunch of sequels.

895
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:33,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there at least a Clock Tower 3?

896
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,521
[SPEAKER_00]: You were playing Clock Tower 3, weren't you?

897
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:39,364
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was somebody else that I knew, but I've seen the whole first part of Clock Tower 3.

898
01:08:39,404 --> 01:08:41,185
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the last time I touched Clock Tower was...

899
01:08:42,449 --> 01:08:44,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a Contra movie.

900
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:49,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a Silent Hill sequel.

901
01:08:50,512 --> 01:08:51,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you may get it.

902
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:52,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they broke box office.

903
01:08:52,892 --> 01:08:53,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

904
01:08:53,253 --> 01:08:53,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

905
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:54,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

906
01:08:54,613 --> 01:09:10,438
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the very least, for the July 8th opening in Japan, they actually have a Silent Hill haunted house called Shocking House that's up from July 2nd with hours 11am to 6pm for our listeners in Japan.

907
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:14,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And the movie, like I said, opens on July 8th.

908
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:25,458
[SPEAKER_00]: There was actually a big press conference out where they had someone dressed up as a Red Pyramid and a bunch of nurses sort of slumped over.

909
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:31,265
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also, though, a nice quote from Akira Yamaoka.

910
01:09:32,212 --> 01:09:38,234
[SPEAKER_00]: The aim was to make something enjoyable even if the viewer wasn't familiar with the game.

911
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:43,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Which actually I think did a pretty admirable job.

912
01:09:43,115 --> 01:09:45,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that the movie does pretty well in Japan too.

913
01:09:46,235 --> 01:09:49,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that the movie hadn't come out in Japan yet.

914
01:09:49,836 --> 01:09:51,257
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of the most surprising thing to me.

915
01:09:51,337 --> 01:09:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they got it the same time we did so I was kind of surprised they still hadn't seen it.

916
01:09:54,397 --> 01:09:56,578
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd have to have gone through.

917
01:09:56,618 --> 01:10:00,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Because usually I think that it's like a difference of I want to say 1 to 3

918
01:10:02,483 --> 01:10:07,744
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading about this on some various gaming blogs and I noticed the Silent Hill movie was getting a lot of crap.

919
01:10:30,638 --> 01:10:36,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why there's this sudden backlash because it seems like when the movie first came out, these same sites were like, Pyramid Head is awesome.

920
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,601
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was a little surprised by this sudden backlash where it's cool to hate on Silent Hill.

921
01:10:57,523 --> 01:11:06,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand what the whole trend is with these movie viewers who are looking for Oscar quality acting in these movies.

922
01:11:06,932 --> 01:11:09,174
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, where are you the judge?

923
01:11:09,414 --> 01:11:12,277
[SPEAKER_03]: What is Oscar quality acting in the first place?

924
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:18,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, why the hell would you go to a movie like that anyways expecting that you know it's not going to be there?

925
01:11:18,936 --> 01:11:21,998
[SPEAKER_03]: You go there because you want to see Pyramid Head slice people in half.

926
01:11:22,098 --> 01:11:24,340
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically why you would go.

927
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Which didn't quite happen, but you still got cool Pyramid Head killing scenes.

928
01:11:29,823 --> 01:11:30,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a horror movie.

929
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:32,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Horror movies are supposed to be campy and bloody.

930
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:34,286
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they are.

931
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:37,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not like... I don't know.

932
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:39,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Casablanca with blood.

933
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just a movie.

934
01:11:42,892 --> 01:11:45,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of feedback in our chatroom, and then we'll get Magus.

935
01:11:45,354 --> 01:11:46,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Magus, you want to comment first?

936
01:11:46,775 --> 01:11:47,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

937
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:53,531
[SPEAKER_02]: People who expect a lot out of video game movies, just be grateful that it's not like Wing Commander.

938
01:11:55,112 --> 01:11:57,714
[SPEAKER_04]: VXJSnakesV says, Silent Hill was an awesome movie.

939
01:11:58,555 --> 01:12:01,277
[SPEAKER_04]: JeremyTodd1 says, you know, it's because of the hype of the movie.

940
01:12:01,577 --> 01:12:05,340
[SPEAKER_04]: When they just got back from seeing it, they were all like, OMG, that was so awesome.

941
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:07,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Then a month or two later, yeah, that movie sucked.

942
01:12:08,443 --> 01:12:10,965
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, who are you to judge?

943
01:12:11,205 --> 01:12:12,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Oscar quality.

944
01:12:13,527 --> 01:12:15,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamerman55 says, Oscars suck.

945
01:12:17,114 --> 01:12:19,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what typically gets nominated for an Oscar.

946
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,884
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really see horror movies up there too often.

947
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:23,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it was really good.

948
01:12:24,148 --> 01:12:27,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the acting in it was pretty darn good, especially since they had the Borg Queen.

949
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:29,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

950
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:31,530
[SPEAKER_00]: She was so cool.

951
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:36,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some people were kind of pissed off by the second half of the movie, which involved the Borg Queen character.

952
01:12:36,714 --> 01:12:42,038
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, you know, a movie is very hard to do with, you know, one person.

953
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:45,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the only movie I can think of that's really pulled it off is like some of the Alien movies.

954
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,583
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I don't know.

955
01:12:48,384 --> 01:12:49,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't mad by the movie.

956
01:12:49,645 --> 01:12:50,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was great.

957
01:12:50,405 --> 01:12:50,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

958
01:12:51,746 --> 01:12:52,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

959
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:52,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Could have been worse.

960
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:54,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

961
01:12:54,048 --> 01:12:55,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all these people being critical on stuff.

962
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:59,092
[SPEAKER_03]: One person, though, that was critical on things would be...

963
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:00,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Rich Kiyanka of

964
01:13:29,331 --> 01:13:31,093
[SPEAKER_03]: SomethingAwful.com and goes by Lotax.

965
01:13:31,653 --> 01:13:36,797
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually wrote Uebol to see if he could be able to fight him.

966
01:13:37,798 --> 01:13:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, interesting note, he has not, as of writing that letter, he had not written anything bad about Uebol's movies, but Uebol said, yeah, sure, go ahead.

967
01:13:47,526 --> 01:13:56,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he decided to go ahead and officially write a review for House of the Dead, which, or Alone in the Dark, I should say.

968
01:13:56,093 --> 01:13:58,115
[SPEAKER_03]: House of the Dead one's coming later, and

969
01:14:00,163 --> 01:14:03,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just basically a really bad movie.

970
01:14:03,827 --> 01:14:09,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting to see though that he kind of bent the rules to be able to fight this guy.

971
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:12,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is one person that he will be fighting.

972
01:14:13,797 --> 01:14:15,079
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I can do it.

973
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:21,185
[SPEAKER_04]: More people probably read somethingawful.com than actually went and saw Blood Rain, so you know...

974
01:14:21,878 --> 01:14:24,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Oyebol probably has something to win from this

975
01:14:37,558 --> 01:14:39,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to see Postal now.

976
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:43,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to see it just because you can't really mess up Postal.

977
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,420
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no plot to it.

978
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just basically violence.

979
01:14:46,161 --> 01:14:49,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got Gary Coleman in it, which, that's awesome right there.

980
01:14:49,822 --> 01:14:53,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to have a boxing match with Uwe Boll and a bunch of movie critics at the end.

981
01:14:53,683 --> 01:14:55,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that sounds cool.

982
01:14:55,604 --> 01:14:56,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could work.

983
01:14:56,964 --> 01:15:01,345
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, more people are probably interested in seeing Lotex get his ass beat.

984
01:15:01,445 --> 01:15:04,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I say that, I'm not slamming something awful.

985
01:15:04,906 --> 01:15:06,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a goon yet.

986
01:15:07,082 --> 01:15:11,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are people out on the internet who would love to see Lotex get his ass beat, especially by Uwe Boll.

987
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:13,927
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I think this is what Uwe Boll needs to do.

988
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:20,452
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs to get out of the video game movie thing and just start making mindlessly violent or cheesy campy movies.

989
01:15:20,752 --> 01:15:25,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's got the kind of thing down with, you know, Alone in the Dark and stuff.

990
01:15:25,616 --> 01:15:27,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make your own source material.

991
01:15:27,437 --> 01:15:32,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That way people can't say, oh, you know, he based it on... It's not even near the game or something like that.

992
01:15:32,341 --> 01:15:33,141
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he needs to do.

993
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he doesn't understand how to make...

994
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:43,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Good movies, so make crappy movies that have a lot of B actors in it and just go crazy with that.

995
01:15:43,394 --> 01:15:49,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Snakes on a Plane is a perfect example of something you can do to that effect, but just go crazy with it.

996
01:15:50,059 --> 01:15:53,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best movies out there are movies that don't make sense, like Giant Crickets Attacking Earth.

997
01:15:54,002 --> 01:15:56,584
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't make any sense, but they're good to watch.

998
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:01,748
[SPEAKER_04]: GK128 seems to back up what you're saying, Loki.

999
01:16:01,788 --> 01:16:04,630
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, Postal will be awful, but at least we'll expect it.

1000
01:16:05,751 --> 01:16:06,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1001
01:16:08,198 --> 01:16:09,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Guy gets angry, goes kill things.

1002
01:16:10,022 --> 01:16:12,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's pretty simple to me.

1003
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1004
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:16,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it worked for, what was that movie?

1005
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:19,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot, now I can't remember.

1006
01:16:19,512 --> 01:16:20,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Falling Down?

1007
01:16:20,112 --> 01:16:20,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Falling Down.

1008
01:16:22,652 --> 01:16:23,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Falling Down was a good movie.

1009
01:16:24,853 --> 01:16:27,534
[SPEAKER_00]: If he makes it like Falling Down, then I'll go see it.

1010
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:41,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly though, if Uwe Boll's Postal was playing next door to another fucking Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock movie, I would rather, if forced to gunpoint, go see the Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock movie than that.

1011
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:49,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So how fast does the lake house have to be traveling before it explodes?

1012
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:52,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need a break now.

1013
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:55,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please.

1014
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:56,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's cleanse the palate.

1015
01:16:56,969 --> 01:17:02,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back very shortly with more of episode 188 of Orange Lounge Radio.

1016
01:17:02,392 --> 01:17:03,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Our fourth birthday.

1017
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:04,553
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to go cut the cake.

1018
01:17:05,254 --> 01:17:10,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1019
