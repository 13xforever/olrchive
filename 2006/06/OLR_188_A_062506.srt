00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Tivo is coming to your PSP and happy birthday to Sonic the Hedgehog.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Good evening everybody and welcome to

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,800
Orange Lounge Radio. It is June 25th, 2006

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,760
and you're listening to episode number 188 of our little program.

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,760
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye. Joining me as always, say

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,440
hello to Dark Sakura. Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,560
Hi. How you doing? Sleepy.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,800
Yeah, me too. I'm a little exhausted. I'll get into why in a little while though.

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,800
But say hello also to LOKI!

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Hi.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
How you doin'?

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm okay.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Great.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Also joining us tonight, say hello to our special guest, the 23rd Magus!

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Yo, what's up?

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
How you doin'?

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Caffeinated.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Now you just had a birthday recently.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Oh yeah, 21st.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's a big one, it's 21st.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
So how did you celebrate the 21st birthday?

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Did you go to a bar, get tossed, what?

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I had a Guinness one to bed.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Alright.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Not much.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Alright, that's alright.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
But I think my 21st birthday was probably about that exciting too, so...

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,960
It's all good. No big deal. Alright.

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,880
Yeah, it's like you do everything bad and then when you're 21 it's like,

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,920
eh, no big deal.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,000
Now I'm actually old enough to be doing this. Now I can do it legally.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,080
Oh, what's the reason to?

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,800
Let's go ahead and start this show off. We are here to talk about video games

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,720
and gaming news and all that good stuff. And we're going to get into

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,240
how is your gaming week. But first, just a couple announcements. First off,

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,280
Join our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat if you are listening live here

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,740
on this Sunday evening.

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,660
You should head on over there and listen.

39
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,380
You can always listen to our program live on orangeloungeradio.com every Sunday night

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,960
at 6 o'clock Pacific, or you can listen to us live on All Games Radio, that's allgames.com

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,000
every Monday night at 7 p.m. with a couple repeats Tuesday afternoon, but you can't do

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,400
chat during then, sorry, because we can only be here live once.

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Also, the other announcement I wanted to say was it's our fourth birthday this week, officially.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,600
The first episode of Orange Launch Radio aired June 23rd, 2002, so this is our fourth birthday

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,520
show, and so now we're old enough to be potty trained, certainly, and probably be going

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,720
to preschool, our little program, so we're very happy.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
We're big kids now.

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Yes.

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,800
Actually, we've probably graduated for the pull-ups.

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,800
We've been out of diapers for a little while and probably can read short little books, maybe.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
We'll see.

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
When I was three, I could say condensation.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Oh yeah, well I could say anti-disestablishmentarianism.

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
No, just kidding.

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I could spell it.

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Alright, anyway.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
We're smart kids.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
We're special.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
I was playing Atari 2600 at four, though.

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I remember that.

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I was playing the Odyssey 2 at two years old.

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Duck Hunt.

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Wow.

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Alright, yeah.

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
It just goes to show.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
We just dated ourselves.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
ourselves how much older we are than him.

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm the LOBY here, I'm the LOBY.

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
You need to gain a few more levels.

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
We're gonna get around to

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
How Was Your Gaming Week.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
We're not doing anything super fancy for our

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
4th birthday, I mean hooray we're 4, but

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
we think we're gonna save

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
the guests and

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
the retrospective and all that

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
stuff for episode 200, which is coming up

78
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
this September, because that's a huge milestone.

79
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
200.

80
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Let's go around and do How Was Your Gaming

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,560
What kind of video games have you been playing?

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,000
Dark Sakura, start us off.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,640
I played a little World of Warcraft pretty much long enough to make a character on a

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
server with my co-workers.

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah, my co-workers play World of Warcraft.

86
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,960
Played some Animal Crossing, holding off getting my copy of Oendon for a little bit just because

87
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,760
stupid stuff getting in the way of my fun.

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
And I did my tabletop gaming this week.

89
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,280
Yes, I do tabletop gaming.

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
That's really about it.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Alright.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,840
What kind of tabletop game are you guys playing?

93
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Play werewolf.

94
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,760
Our Buffy game is on hiatus for a season.

95
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Wow.

96
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,520
Not only have you dated yourself this evening, now you've made yourself an obvious nerd.

97
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
I don't care.

98
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
I mean, come on.

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Who plays Buffy roleplay?

100
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,080
You've got to be a hardcore nerd to be doing Buffy roleplay.

101
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Dude, I did...

102
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,080
Okay, you're the one that picked up the GURPS book today.

103
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
I was...

104
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
I didn't know what it was.

105
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
I was like, what's a GURP?

106
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Is that like a LARP?

107
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,080
My first, actually my second roleplay ever was GURPS.

108
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,080
My third was Shadowrun, my fourth was D&D.

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Okay, you have dated yourself. I have definitely not progressed past 3rd edition D&D.

110
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,080
I refused to play 3rd edition. I started on 2nd edition. I still had 1st edition books.

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,080
You're not the first person I've heard say something negative about 3rd edition. What's so bad about it?

112
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:16,040
bad about it everything except for constitution based magic casting i missed stako it made it so

113
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:24,280
easy all right uh we're gonna go ahead and head on over to loki how was your gaming week it was good

114
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,400
um i don't know really didn't play a whole lot i played more call of duty 2 actually last night

115
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,320
we were trying out the new maps and i finally got on the work i think that they had like another

116
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,680
update or something that allowed those maps that you can purchase or download for free

117
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
to work.

118
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,220
And there was one of the maps that had this giant silo on it and you basically climb up

119
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,880
to the top and snipe people down from the top of that.

120
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,360
So that's actually pretty fun to play just that map.

121
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,840
Played a little bit more Blazing Angels trying to beat the damn thing all the way.

122
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,040
I played a little bit of Mutant Storm Reloaded because I'm on level 89 and I have to beat

123
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
it.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,700
But then again, all the effort I put into that and I looked at the achievement that

125
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,820
that unlocks and that's like 15 points, I'm like, is it really worth the 15 points?

126
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,420
Well if you're on level 89 at this point you might as well finish it.

127
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
It's just, it's, it's...

128
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,420
How many levels are there?

129
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,220
It's like 95 or something, right?

130
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
No, 89.

131
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,100
Oh great, so you're on the very last level and you just can't beat it?

132
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,540
Well here's the thing, the difficulty like, it ramps up very strange.

133
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,020
It gets really hard and it kind of gets easier, and it's super duper hard.

134
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,640
So I don't get it.

135
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:38,280
But I don't know, it's an okay game, I just need to finish it so I can get the damn achievement.

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,040
I played Gauntlet for a little bit, and I don't know why.

137
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
But yeah, I tried that.

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Achievement points!

139
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
You want more achievement points?

140
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,840
I think I was looking at your profile, and you don't have any achievement points for

141
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,480
Gauntlet, and I have like 25, therefore I am the better Gauntlet player than you.

142
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Because I haven't played Gauntlet.

143
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Whatever.

144
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,280
Anyways, what else did I play?

145
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,480
I think it played whack-a-mole. No, it did not play whack-a-mole. I tell you what, it

146
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,360
didn't play. It didn't play point blank DS because freaking GameStop doesn't have it

147
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,760
because they suck. Anyways, I think that was all I played. I didn't really play too much

148
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,400
this week. I've been trying to... Oh, a lot of Test Drive Unlimited demo. A whole lot

149
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,080
of that. We've been trying to see how we can exploit the demo. I keep forgetting to download

150
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,340
It's fun because the cars the police cars are stupid

151
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,560
They downloaded that at arena the week of e3 and I played it like once and it was kind of cool

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,000
Like I haven't been excited about a test drive game since like the days of Commodore 64 and this one looks pretty neat

153
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,020
We excited we managed to I was playing it

154
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,720
The Lamborghini goes quite fast off-road ironically enough and the police cannot get you if you're off-road

155
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Then, we took an SUV, we slammed into it, and we knocked it into the ocean.

156
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
Well done, you should get points for that.

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,120
We knocked it into the ocean, which is supposed to be just like, you know, a few inches deep

158
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,220
when it's washing ashore, but apparently the way the game is designed, it's just a cliff

159
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,800
and the car just disappeared.

160
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
And I jumped the fence, and I jumped into this yard that I couldn't get out of, which

161
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:23,080
was fun, and I also got my car stuck between a rock and a house, and what other fun stuff

162
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:30,280
do we do oh yeah we jumped a mountain that was fun but the game is very flawed

163
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,560
in but it's I guess it's just a demo right now you know it's obviously not

164
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,080
even near finished but there's a lot of things that got fixed on that a lot a

165
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,900
lot of things but um I don't know we'll see it's this is the game that my boss

166
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,800
says we'll get him to buy an Xbox 360 I'm like you know there's like a lot of

167
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,940
of better games out there why this one but whatever all right my gaming week

168
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,300
was also kind of unexciting I didn't really play a lot of new stuff I played

169
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,060
burnout you know because I there's nothing more fun than doing the synth

170
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,020
pop burnout running through the traffic attack and then once in a while I'll

171
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,580
throw in journey greatest hits or Abba or something like really you know weird

172
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,460
but it's fun to drive to and then I was playing a World of Warcraft still I was

173
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,340
I was on LA for most of the week with a business trip, which reminds me, if you go to All Games

174
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,260
Interactive's show, and I know a lot of you guys listen to them over allgames.com, I'm

175
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,220
on their Tuesday show this week, because I dropped by Arena right after work on Tuesday,

176
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,740
and I was in a really bad mood on Tuesday.

177
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,740
I know what was wrong, I woke up at 3.30 in the morning on Tuesday, so I really beat up

178
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,340
on a couple of their regulars, and I almost felt bad when I listened to the playback of

179
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,120
the show I was like God I was rude it's like going to someone's house and like

180
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,220
drinking all their soda and eating all their food that's kind of what I did on

181
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,160
Tuesday so check it out if you want to see me being a bitch

182
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,500
otherwise as far as new games go I did look at big brain Academy for like five

183
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,240
seconds unfortunately I'll have to wait and give a full review on that next week

184
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,680
however let me talk about a book and you might be thinking wait why would you

185
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,120
talk about a book on a video game show because it has to do with gaming my

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,000
My birthday happens to be tomorrow, and Dark Sakura treated me to a Queen for a day, took

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,320
me out to lunch, took me out to dessert, and then took me to a bookstore and said, essentially,

188
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,040
in so many words, we're not leaving here until you pick out a book to buy.

189
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,080
So I picked out a book called I Am 8-Bit, which has to do with the 8-bit exhibit that

190
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,960
you see in L.A. every E3, and they have some great art exhibits, and I gotta tell you,

191
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,440
My favorite picture in the I Am 8-Bit book is one where Mario is standing there and he's

192
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,040
looking at the princess, who's lying there naked on the bed, buck-ass naked, and Mario

193
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,440
looks kind of, yeah, it's got a little titty in the book, which makes it, you know, even

194
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
better, right?

195
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Some porn?

196
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
So, and Mario's...

197
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
No, no, no, you said it was erotica.

198
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,120
Yeah, I'm sorry, it was erotica, because Jamie was making fun of me, like, ah, you're buying

199
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
porn.

200
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,000
I was like, no, it's erotica.

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,140
But Mario's all looking confused, like he doesn't know what to do.

202
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,400
But you see, you know how like sometimes guys, when they don't know what to do, they'll write

203
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
notes on their hand?

204
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,680
Like, you know, when they want to break up and don't know what to say, they'll write

205
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
it on their hand?

206
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,700
Well, if you look at Mario's hand, what he's looking down at, it has a Konami code on it.

207
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,980
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

208
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,260
So frickin' funny.

209
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm sorry, that was a great picture.

210
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,020
I'll have to show that to you later, Loki, like during the break, you'd get a kick out

211
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
of that.

212
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,560
So I Am 8-Bit is the book, and two thumbs up, I'm sorry, eight thumbs up from me.

213
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,840
a good book a good coffee table book for a gamer all right let's go ahead and get

214
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,880
into some gaming news for this evening by the way if you want to join our chat

215
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,080
room and give some feedback once again it's orange launch radio comm click on

216
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,000
chat and see Wonder Dog Harold says I'm sorry Mario but my dress is in another

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,560
castle in reference to the photo I was describing there I was funny that was a

218
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,360
good time by the way one of our chatters DMN is having a little chat room contest

219
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,200
and officially on the record we're not really able to sponsor it but we think

220
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,120
it's cool

221
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,800
DM is actually going to give away a Wii because he has ties to Nintendo so like

222
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,000
to the chatter I think they're playing around the horn and to the chatter that

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,280
gets the most points or the average points the best average points wins a Wii

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,920
so it just is incentive to participate live in our chat room so if you're not

225
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,680
there

226
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,560
you should be asking yourself why am I not there and we're getting into some

227
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,800
Some gaming news tonight, we are not the only one celebrating a birthday today, actually

228
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,360
Sonic is also celebrating his 15th anniversary and GameTab's getting in on the fun, they're

229
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,160
offering subscribers a trio of titles which are the lock-on versions of Sonic.

230
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,320
For instance, Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles, Knuckles in Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 Sonic and

231
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Knuckles.

232
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,100
Remember how like, you know, you could use the cart and plug it into the old carts and

233
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
you have a new game?

234
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,760
That was amazing.

235
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,540
What a cute technology that you never really saw outside of that, at least I don't remember

236
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
it.

237
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,380
I liked how you could plug in random Sega games on the cartridge and then you could

238
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,460
do the special stages in different ways with different games.

239
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Really?

240
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
I didn't even know you could use it with other games.

241
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,660
You'd have to, I forgot what it was, you had to hold down the buttons while you loaded

242
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,940
the game and it would load up all the special stages on different cartridges.

243
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
That's kind of cool.

244
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,340
I like that.

245
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,280
Well anyway, you can download those on GameTap, no plug-in, no cartridges needed, all that

246
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,660
good stuff if you're a GameTap member.

247
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:38,300
Also, they added on to GameTap TV three behind-the-scenes looks at Sonic the Hedgehog, so if you like

248
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,860
to watch that stuff that GameTap TV produces, which is far better than anything G4 is producing

249
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,820
currently, check it out.

250
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,580
It's a good time.

251
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,920
Also, just to join in on the fun here, Sega has revealed that they're going to be doing

252
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,420
two new portable Sonic games, and there's a first look at those screens there.

253
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,780
What they're basically doing is that they're going to do Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis for

254
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:10,580
the Game Boy Advance, and it's going to have additions to Sonic the Hedgehog, but it will

255
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,100
have Sonic Spin Dash, and it's also going to have a save ability.

256
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Also coming out on the PSP, Sonic Rivals, which is a one-on-one racing game that will

257
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,900
have knuckles and it's gonna have like kind of like a 2d combined with a 3d

258
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,980
world type thing I played the hell out of that at e3 oh what you think oh it's

259
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,300
so good and I won all the time and they gave me a t-shirt but it really is it's

260
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,900
almost like playing you know old-school Sonic with updated graphics but instead

261
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,660
your goal is just to make it through the level as fast as humanly possible it's

262
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:56,660
It's like doing the old Tails races in Sonic Adventure, just on 2D.

263
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Did you play it at all?

264
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
You did?

265
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
No, I didn't.

266
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,900
Oh, it's definitely one that I would suggest to everyone to get out.

267
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,940
We had a lot of game purchases go on lately.

268
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,300
Mario cut a half a million copies in the u.s. And over one month just over a month

269
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,980
They're saying basically 20 copies were sold every minute

270
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,160
Which I think they did the math and that didn't end up being correct, but you know, it's a lot

271
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,060
Well in the first two days they sold a hundred and thirty six thousand five hundred units. Wow, so

272
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
basically, that's just

273
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,780
pretty, pretty, you know, hardcore for game sales.

274
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,280
Half a million, you said? Half a million, five hundred thousand.

275
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,280
That's pretty darn good for a game that really hasn't been out that long, all things considered, yeah.

276
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,780
It's at the top of the charts. Yeah, absolutely. So it's having the same...

277
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,780
The rated E games are taking over.

278
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,780
It's having the same non-stop hysteria-ness here that it's been having in Japan, essentially.

279
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,780
This goes to show that old school will win you points for the masses.

280
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,940
especially when it comes to Nintendo. You know, I don't know

281
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,660
if Sony were to release a new Crash Bandicoot for the PSP

282
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,740
I don't know if it would have the same...yeah I don't know...because

283
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,980
Crash Bandicoot they've really beaten into the ground but isn't that weird that we

284
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,860
feel burnt out on Crash Bandicoot

285
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,420
yet Nintendo has way horrid Mario more often. They don't need to deviate from the

286
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,860
formula because it works.

287
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,100
The other thing too is Crash Bandicoot is in the first party

288
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,620
Okay, I don't know. I tried to think of like a Sony mascot. That's the best thing I can come up with

289
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,860
Well, that's because it was you know at one point, you know their mascot because that's all they really had and now it's not

290
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,460
They don't really have a mascot they have you know

291
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
giant crabs, I guess

292
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
giant crabs could be the mascot I

293
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
Don't know

294
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,420
Rhinos in Africa.

295
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:31,060
saying that original hits like Geometry Wars and Smash TV and casual games would extend

296
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,540
the 360's appeal to non-hardcore audiences and also those people that, and I don't know

297
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,100
why people don't have broadband yet, but the people that don't have broadband can't download

298
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:50,020
them. But, ironically enough, information arrived to me this week saying that actually

299
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,900
Hopefully this is going to be happening sooner than later.

300
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,120
There is going to be a game coming out in September called the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged.

301
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,440
And what it's going to contain is a few games, including Geometry Wars, Texas Hold'em, which

302
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,980
is supposed to be coming out in July I think, Wick, Bejeweled 2, Outpost's Cloaky X, Hardwood

303
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,420
Backgammon, which I don't believe is out yet.

304
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,740
No, Backgammon is on the marketplace, I'm pretty sure.

305
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Oh, it is?

306
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Yeah.

307
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
No, I wouldn't play it anyway.

308
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,900
are like the hardwood games or whatever.

309
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,660
Free, which will also come with a free month of gold, which they include with like almost

310
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,500
every game nowadays, and a hundred free Microsoft points.

311
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
And that's...

312
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,940
So you can download some crappy icons, because that's about what a hundred points will buy

313
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
you, is crappy icons.

314
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

315
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,240
But that's coming, and it's supposed to retail for about $39.99 for the whole package.

316
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,900
So that's pretty sweet if you don't have access to broadband and live and stuff and other

317
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,080
than that, I don't know.

318
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,040
I could see them doing this later on and stuff with maybe some more games and stuff.

319
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,680
Now you said the information came to you, how did you get this?

320
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,400
Anonymous tip or were you listening in a top secret board meeting?

321
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
No.

322
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,640
Because I saw on Joystiq when they ran the article, I saw that there was a little addendum

323
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,240
and they said, thanks for the tip, Loki.

324
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,920
And I'm like, what the hell?

325
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,480
What is Loki doing?

326
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,880
Because it was you.

327
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,040
And I'm like, what the hell?

328
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,400
So where did you get this information from?

329
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,120
This was for my work.

330
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,000
This is straight from Microsoft, by the way.

331
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,500
Wow.

332
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,600
Because they gave us information on a ton of things.

333
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,280
We'll see if they give you any more information, loud mouth.

334
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
They gave it to all the retailers.

335
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,860
It's just that you don't have people

336
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,720
that work in the press and retail at the same time.

337
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,440
Except for you.

338
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,000
Except for me.

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,600
All right.

340
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,240
Interesting.

341
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,280
I look every day at least like four or five times a day for new

342
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
information

343
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,600
I am

344
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,080
That surprises me that the mainstream gaming press doesn't have their nose in

345
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,500
retail somehow

346
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,840
Well they do, they watch their

347
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,540
Best Buy release dates and how awful that crap

348
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,200
Interesting, that's so interesting

349
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,560
Well also Xbox Live, one thing they're definitely looking forward to over on

350
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,400
Xbox Live is Luminous

351
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,040
What's interesting about this though, you know we've talked a little bit about

352
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,260
about luminous now it's supposed to be one of the more expensive Xbox Live

353
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,300
arcade games is gonna go for 1200 Microsoft points or $15 get this

354
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:20,840
supposedly it's not going to have Xbox Live multiplayer on it by default what's

355
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,360
going on is Tetsuya Mitsugishi who you know created the game he actually

356
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,920
detailed some plans where he's saying that the multiplayer support is going to

357
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,200
be an add-on that's separately viable now they have not finalized the decision

358
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,000
on that but that's basically saying that okay even though you spend $15 on the

359
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,680
game it's not going to be multiplayer unless you spend a little more money by

360
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,720
the way also you're gonna have to do license music backgrounds that's all

361
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,640
gonna be premium downloads as well so interesting comparisons been made where

362
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,360
If you think about it, Luminous, when it first came out on the PSP, was $40.

363
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,800
So this makes this whole Luminous Live thing look like a real deal, but come to think of

364
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,880
it, now you can get Luminous for $19.99 on the PSP, so is this going to end up really

365
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
being a deal?

366
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
I don't know.

367
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
How bad do you want Luminous on your TV?

368
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,080
I think it's just stupid.

369
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,360
I can understand it because I don't know how many people played Luminous multiplayer, and

370
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,520
I don't know if it's really going to add anything to it, but the fact that you're really trying

371
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,840
to charge extra for it, I don't like it just because other companies are going to get the

372
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
same idea.

373
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:39,060
You know, oh we can cripple our games when we send them out and charge you extra to add

374
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,440
the features that you want.

375
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,420
You don't have to have two player, you know, but we're going to make you buy it.

376
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,420
So I don't like that kind of thinking.

377
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,780
The only reason why I'm not super pissed off about this, and I think a lot of people have

378
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,660
and saying, oh, this is an outrage.

379
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,420
This is too much to be charging for an arcade title.

380
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,420
I kind of think, you know, if the creators of this game

381
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,140
wanted to, they could probably get away

382
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,420
with releasing this as an over-the-counter title

383
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,500
in the nice little clamshell and everything for $39.99.

384
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,240
You know, they release these games all the time,

385
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,020
especially early on in a console's life period,

386
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,540
where the game takes up very little space on the disk.

387
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,180
Think about the first PlayStation 2 games.

388
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,420
They were all on CD.

389
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,320
They barely took up any space at all.

390
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,880
So if the creators of this game wanted to,

391
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
they didn't have to sell it on arcade.

392
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,680
They probably could have done a in-store release

393
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,480
for 40 bucks and gotten away with it.

394
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,440
I'll bet you anything they do that, too.

395
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,880
Just like, now we're seeing it with, you know,

396
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
the thing you were talking about

397
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
where they have the arcade titles coming out for retail

398
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,000
for those folks who aren't plugged in.

399
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,040
I'll bet you anything Luminous does come out that way

400
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,960
as well, but, and only kinda when I put it in that light

401
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,720
where it's, well, at least you're not paying 40 bucks

402
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,240
for the clamshell, am I not pissed off about this.

403
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,320
Then you also get the games like Call of Duty 2 that release the game of your edition which

404
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,960
just basically has the game and the downloadable content for it on there.

405
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,440
And then they re-skew it as something new.

406
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,840
So, I don't know.

407
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,840
It's kind of an interesting way of selling things.

408
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,280
Going to our chat room at OrangeLionTrader.com, click on chat.

409
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,320
FunnyDale says, so what are you telling me?

410
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,000
Is that a game that costs 20 bucks on the PSP is going to cost me $200 to play the full

411
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,040
version on Xbox Live, well I don't know about 200, that might be a little extreme, but by

412
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,040
the time all these micropayments and multiplayer and extra skins and stuff add up, yeah, you're

413
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,640
probably looking at about $40, which is what the original game would have cost you on the

414
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
PSP.

415
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,520
But again, I kind of go back to that scenario, you know, they could get away with...

416
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,200
If they had never said this was going to be on arcade, if they just said Luminous is coming

417
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,240
out for the Xbox 360. I don't think people would have batted an eye at a $40 price tag

418
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,440
for it, because that's what all the other games cost.

419
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,420
But the thing is, and I would still be kinda pissed off about it, is that they didn't really

420
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:02,360
do anything with the graphics and stuff. It's not improved in any way. It's just a port.

421
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,700
From what we saw of Luminous 2 at E3, not a damn thing's changed there either. So I

422
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,280
don't know if that was just an early announcement build or something, I hope so, because that

423
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,240
That would be very disappointing.

424
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,920
Luminous is a fantastic game, and I hope they're not going to screw the series by milking it

425
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,880
without giving us something new with it, because that's kind of what happened with Tetris.

426
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,800
That's why Tetris kind of went downhill for a long time.

427
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,920
I mean, granted, it's had a resurgence a couple times, Tetris DS being the latest one, but

428
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,960
there was a while there where we were just all burned out on Tetris, right?

429
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,240
You kind of see Tetris on the shelf, you go, oh goody, another Tetris clone, right?

430
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:50,720
Yeah, well speaking of live games, the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged wasn't the only thing

431
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,280
that I heard about that was coming out.

432
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,560
We actually got updates on all of the Xbox 360 accessories that are going to be coming

433
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,240
out including Xbox Live Vision, which we now have a date, which is supposed to be September

434
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,640
20th around there, you know it shouldn't change too much.

435
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,220
I can confirm though it is going to be coming with UNO bundled in there as well as yet again

436
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,800
a one month trial to Xbox Live Gold and a headset is going to be packaged with that

437
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
as well.

438
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,220
So you will be getting the nice little camera and all that other fun stuff.

439
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,680
What's also cool is the camera can work with your PC which I think is really neat also.

440
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,040
No price yet on that though.

441
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,740
Also going to be coming out in November on the 15th so far is the 256 megabyte memory

442
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:45,180
unit. No price on that yet either but of course for the price of it you might as well just

443
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,900
buy a hard drive to be honest. It's probably going to be about 50 bucks I'm thinking. And

444
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,060
then of course also around the same time we have the wireless headset which is also coming

445
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,300
out in November and that should be pretty cool as well. At least hopefully it will sound

446
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:09,900
better than the current headset that they have for the Xbox 360. And I also know that

447
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:19,140
the HD DVD player is supposed to be coming out around that same time too. So, good stuff.

448
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,780
Going to our chat room, orangeonshooter.com, click on chat. GK128 says, Bastards already

449
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,820
bought Uno. I'm sure that's the way most of us feel. What do we get if we already have

450
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,820
Are they going to give us some points or is it just screw you?

451
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,820
They should just give us Microsoft points.

452
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
I think it's just going to be a sucker.

453
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,820
You got to play for all these months before the game came out on shelves.

454
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,820
I'm surprised they don't sell the live arcade games in stores.

455
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:50,820
Because all they are, for example when I bought my live, the 12 month kit that came with the headset.

456
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Because I bought a core system and I didn't have a headset.

457
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,820
Which I never really used the headset either.

458
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,700
But it came with Bank Shot Billiards 2

459
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,500
and it was just one of those cards that you pull the tab off and it has a code on it and you

460
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,780
redeem it for a game.

461
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,660
I'm surprised they don't sell those at the store.

462
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,580
My all thought was that the reason why they did it that way is because they're

463
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,700
bypassing retail when they sell it on Xbox Live Arcade and that's how they can

464
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,780
get away with doing it so cheap. I mean five bucks for Geometry Wars.

465
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,140
That's a freaking steal. You know if they had released that game through a

466
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,420
retailer

467
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,740
you would have had so many people to go through that want a bite of the money

468
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,020
coming from the consumer

469
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,340
they would not be able to sell that game for five dollars. It would have been at least

470
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,100
twenty, if not more. So that's kind of why I always felt that

471
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,200
Xbox Live Arcade kind of existed, was for them to sell the games

472
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,460
directly. You know, I'm surprised that they are packaging with Uno, to be honest.

473
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,020
I don't think that's really a game that would benefit from the camera.

474
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,900
I think with cutting out the middleman, like you said,

475
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,420
with Xbox Live downloadable games, I think they're

476
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,660
kind of taking a hint from Valve and the releases

477
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,100
of various games, Half-Life 2,

478
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,900
Sin episodes, Darwinia, things like that. Downloadable content, they can offer it

479
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,700
for cheaper,

480
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,300
and in some cases a lot easier than just

481
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,020
going to the store.

482
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:24,620
Anyway, also something that could be coming out for the 360, we don't know if this is

483
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,980
going to be for sure yet, however, this is kind of interesting, apparently Peter Moore

484
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,380
recently gave an interview on another podcast, we've talked about these guys before, they're

485
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,460
pretty cool, Gamertag Radio, they snagged Peter Moore, lucky guys, well Peter Moore

486
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,780
was on that station, he was saying that shoulder buttons, triggers, analog sticks, D-pads,

487
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:50,220
There's a lot going on when you compare it to an Atari 2600 button and stick.

488
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:56,180
So basically what he's saying is that, you know, he's imagining that he's kind of insinuating

489
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,840
that they're going to be doing a simpler controller, basically with the Xbox Live Arcade downloads

490
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,780
in mind, because if you think about a lot of those Xbox Live Arcade downloads, UNO,

491
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,700
Geometry Wars, you don't really use a lot of the buttons on the Xbox 360 controller.

492
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,660
They could get away with releasing a controller with one or two buttons, and most of the games

493
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,180
would support that there. So, now nothing is being confirmed by Microsoft directly,

494
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,900
but they're basically saying that, yeah, we're going to continue to innovate wherever we

495
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,040
can. But still, it's kind of interesting when Peter Moore says this, you know he's in the

496
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,260
know of what's going on at Microsoft.

497
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
That's so stupid.

498
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,340
What do you think? Why?

499
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,180
If you're buying a 360, you obviously know how to use a controller anyways. What the

500
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,560
hell? I mean, all the other games you're playing use the entire controller. I think you should

501
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,460
be familiar enough with it to all of a sudden become retarded when you start playing an

502
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:48,340
Xbox live arcade game and don't tell me you're just buying the system to play those live arcade games because that's even more retarded

503
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, what about the whole trying to make the system accessible like, you know

504
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,020
To people who aren't the hardcore gamers because I know quite a few people probably think the idea of playing Uno

505
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,040
It's kind of cool that aren't the hardcore gamers. Are they going to be buying a 360 to play Uno?

506
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,940
Please don't tell me that they're actually gonna go spend $400 on a system to play Uno

507
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
Uno!

508
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:16,180
Also, if they need something so simple, they can just go to, you know, Wal-Mart and buy

509
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,720
a Uno deck.

510
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,140
And the other thing, too, is they don't have to use the analog, since that's way too complex,

511
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,680
you know, using an analog nub on there.

512
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,980
You know, in most of the games, anyways, there are about one or two buttons.

513
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,600
It's not like they have to remember which button they have to push.

514
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,580
What about in trying to justify it as a family purchase?

515
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:40,260
You know, the kid, let's say the 17-year-old male who really wants the system for the household

516
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,200
is trying to tell mom and dad, you know, all the good reasons is like, hey, you guys could

517
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
even play Uno on it if you wanted to.

518
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,840
Even though, you know, that's not really what the system is going to be mainly for.

519
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,280
It's going to be for the gamer.

520
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,640
It's got that accessibility and again that whole, you know, because what are these next

521
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
gen systems trying to be?

522
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,720
They're trying to be the living room centerpiece, right?

523
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,160
That has to be accessible to everybody.

524
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,800
I still think it's unnecessary.

525
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,360
I understand it with the Wii, being the way that the Wii controller is, it doesn't have

526
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,260
that many buttons on it anyways.

527
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,880
It's got like a directional pad and a couple, you know, buttons on it, so you can't really

528
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,100
play any, you know, the games that are on there with that controller.

529
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,500
So you do need something extra to, you know, be able to play those games.

530
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,700
But the live games right now, and especially, what if the live games become more complex

531
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,620
later on, and are gonna need more buttons?

532
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,620
I still think it's ridiculous to expect someone to go out and buy another controller just

533
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,860
do exactly what this normal controller can do it's like wow here i can go spend more money on a

534
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,420
controller that can't do what the normal controller can do and i can tell you this much buying

535
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:46,940
accessories for a 360 it's expensive as it is each one of those controllers is about 50 bucks

536
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:52,060
you know what i think you should be fine with just the one controller okay again devil's advocate

537
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:59,100
what why then do they sell dvd remotes separately for like playstation 2 you don't need it okay

538
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,400
Well the reason why they sell those separately is sometimes those DVD remotes have

539
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,640
features that you can't normally do like angle change and all that stuff.

540
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,500
Normally you can pull it up all that on the PlayStation, you just have to know your way around the menus.

541
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,900
Yes, you can do it through menus but why bother doing it through menus when you have dedicated buttons for that?

542
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,700
That's not to say, you know, the convenience of the consumer.

543
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,300
Yes, it is for the convenience but here's the thing though,

544
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,400
is it's still convenient to use the same buttons on there.

545
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,800
They have triggers and analog sticks. I mean, how hard is it? It's not like I can't

546
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,600
figure out the buttons, it's pretty simplified.

547
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Alright, well we welcome your feedback on this issue.

548
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,720
You can always send us an email. It's mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com

549
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,320
or we'll open up the skype line a little later on in the program.

550
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,080
Well I suppose they can, you know, save some money, you know,

551
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,960
especially since, you know, the 360 is supposedly gonna, well the rumor is going

552
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,240
around that it's supposed to drop

553
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,280
in price around Christmas and I think that's a big

554
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,680
a bunch of crap, if you ask me. Basically, you know, this has been going back and forth,

555
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,440
you know, people saying, oh yeah, it's gonna drop, you know, we heard it from such and such person,

556
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,320
that's gonna drop $100 to make it look, you know, more enticing for the people, you know,

557
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,440
not to buy the Wii and stuff. But then again, at the same time, you know, why do they need to drop

558
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,520
the price when the PS3 is, you know, $600? I don't think it's gonna drop, and if I remember

559
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,720
correctly, I think Peter Moore actually said, no, they're not dropping the price of the system.

560
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,600
them. Who's saying that the price is going to drop? Is it just internet rumor? A source

561
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,600
close to Microsoft. So, Joe Nobody, you know, basically saying that it's going to drop.

562
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,440
A friend of a friend's cousin's, you know, brother's, uncle's. Yeah, who probably works

563
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,040
in the help center and is an expert on everything, you know, and so, I don't think it's going

564
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,880
to drop. I actually see a small price cut reasonable. I don't think like a hundred bucks,

565
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,360
but I could see like maybe they throw in a game like a cheapy game or they

566
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
throw in

567
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,520
yeah like a or they cut it by 20, 40 maybe 50 dollars

568
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,120
that seems a lot more possible especially around the holidays. That seems feasible like Forza 2

569
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,920
and the 360 I could see that happening that makes more sense because

570
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,840
you know you spend the money on the game system you want to have something to

571
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,400
play

572
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,120
on Christmas morning there that that makes more sense than dropping the price

573
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,320
of the system a hundred bucks cause I don't think that's gonna happen

574
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,880
Going over to our chat room, jaded2006 says,

575
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,220
I laugh, someone actually named Joe Nobody is listening.

576
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,420
I guess maybe there's somebody he knows who's actually named Joe Nobody.

577
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,100
Good job, Loki.

578
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,900
JeremyTod1 says, if the Wii launches at $250,

579
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,620
then the $360 price will drop to $250 and $350. He seems pretty convinced that

580
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,820
that drop would happen to be competitive with the Wii.

581
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,260
And then, let's see, Hitstun has a question. By the way, how much is an

582
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,460
original Xbox now is it still $1.99 I don't think they aren't they $1.79

583
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,460
they're cheaper than that I think it's like around $1.50 if not I know it's

584
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,700
supposed to drop to $99 I could see them doing that to compete with like the

585
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,140
PlayStation 2 I will research very quickly here while we move on to some

586
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,140
other stories but yeah well there is something you can do with the money that

587
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,220
you're saving on an Xbox 360 if they do drop the price hmm what's that buy porn

588
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:20,540
well yeah that too but you know you can spend a $25,000 on a Gameboy oh yeah

589
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,060
that's just chump change for me I just have that lying around you know we did

590
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,740
see what the $10,000 sushi that's why when you and I went to sushi today they

591
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,820
had the sushi roll for $10,000 and it had like real gold flakes on it and real

592
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,860
gold flakes on it in a two carat diamond you can't eat it to get the menu I saw

593
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,180
it was in the menu and all kinds of expensive caviar $10,000 sushi roll

594
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,740
Listen to me. They had they had that next to the 99 cent air roll, which was has nothing in it. It was just rice

595
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,180
The sushi place was crazy

596
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,820
$100,000, you know what now I know it's restaurant. I'm gonna knock off if I'm gonna go

597
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,500
Wow, this restaurant carries diamonds. I'm going there. I

598
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,140
Think if you complain if you if you get it for free, all right, so basically you have this equivalent of Game Boys

599
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,500
Yeah, there's a $25,000 Game Boy put out by Swiss Supply Direct

600
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,140
That figures the Swiss would come on something crazy like this. Hey, it's my turn

601
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,900
You know, we might have listeners there you jackass

602
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,620
Anyway, it has a diamond set on the display screen it has

603
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,300
diamond off on buttons it has

604
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:40,580
has the original cables, extra game cartridges, a blue leather display case. It's made out

605
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,380
of solid 18 karat gold. The question is, does it have a knife and a

606
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:51,540
corkscrew in it as well? I think so, you know, but it weighs 27 ounces.

607
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,980
It's supposed to be, you know, the price is supposed to be just like right on, you know,

608
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,660
cost of material and sale. But the thing is, is that it's not even like

609
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,380
a cool gameboy it's like an old gameboy it's not even a fucking DS or a GBA or a

610
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:12,460
micro it's a gameboy it's a game brick yeah they just do like a gameboy micro

611
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,380
they would have spent less money on it and then it sort of trendy it should

612
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,980
have come with a knife and corkscrew for me to stab myself with when I realized

613
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,860
I spent $25,000 on a piece of shit the way that this looks is that I could

614
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,140
easily go to like the craft store and get contact paper and those little

615
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,140
model jewels and bling went up myself if I felt so inclined but personally I

616
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,640
think that blinged up equipment is really retarded looking. Didn't they have

617
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,260
like something like that for like little girls to do the jeans and stuff where you

618
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:48,700
like glue on like fake plastic gems and sparkles? As I said really retarded. Why

619
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,220
why wouldn't I be surprised to see Paris Hilton toting around something like this

620
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:58,260
though I mean. Because Paris Hilton has money to spend and no brain to make

621
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
decisions with.

622
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:06,280
Hey guys, you should play my new game Diamond Quest, it's going to be on my $25,000 Swiss

623
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Game Wine.

624
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,500
You saw that they renamed that game to Diamond Quest so that she didn't look like a complete

625
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
idiot.

626
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,340
They should rename it to Stupid Spoiled Horror's Game.

627
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,180
Stupid Spoiled Horror the Game.

628
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
God I hate her.

629
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,180
Anyway.

630
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Anyway.

631
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,260
Sorry, we do that once in a while, the four years of Orange Lounge Radio, we've actually

632
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,360
slipped into Paris Hilton's chat a couple of times. I don't know why it keeps coming

633
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:37,100
back to her. Okay, I can't go way off topic here again. I can't help it, but I've actually

634
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:44,700
caught some of the third season of The Simple Life, Yale to death doing part, and that show

635
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,860
is basically like, if I were the husband in any one of those situations, I would be getting

636
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,820
my ass handed to me because they get them in so much trouble and then their wives basically

637
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,380
just rip into them. It's like basically... Excuse me, I have a question. Is this a video

638
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:08,820
game? Yes. I'm getting to that. Fine. No, actually I'm not. But, okay, completely off

639
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:14,440
topic there. They kind of talked about something that we talked about last week. Louisiana

640
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,180
and their game laws. Basically the one where they were going to be, you know, finding the

641
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:24,340
hell out of retailers for selling indecent stuff. Well, a couple things have happened.

642
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:32,120
First off, judges actually gotten the law temporarily blocked and basically of course

643
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:39,800
this is all the ESA is doing as far as being able to turn this over.

644
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,640
The ESA and EMA have filed suit last Friday to overturn the law and according to the court

645
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:54,160
filings later that day, a federal judge, James J. Brady, granted the trade group's request

646
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,520
for a temporary restraining order preventing the law from being enforced.

647
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:06,680
And basically the three reasons why they, you know, it's very controversial and goes

648
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,060
against a lot of the First Amendment and I think it goes to the Fourteenth Amendment

649
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,540
of the Constitution, and basically the ESA's comment on this was, not only does the Act

650
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:24,060
directly restrict the decimation and receipt of considerable amount of fully protected

651
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:31,620
expression, but because of its numerous vague terms, the Act also creates a chilling effect

652
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,860
on a great deal of speech as video game creators, publishers, manufacturers, distributors and

653
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,020
retailers will respond to the Act's uncertainty by self-censoring, depriving both adults and

654
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:49,220
children access of undeniably protected expression. Basically what they're saying is, you know,

655
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,460
what exactly is obscene, you know, there's nothing really defining it in this and also,

656
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,380
you know, because of this, you know, game publishers and companies will have to start

657
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:07,780
self-censoring the games and that's never good. So, on top of that though, they have

658
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,840
Louisiana governor has a second bill that's gone in place, which I actually kind of like

659
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,660
this one, it would basically add games to lists of media that can be harmful to minors

660
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:28,020
and the ESA is actually for this one and what it's supposed to do is basically just kind

661
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:38,020
of give actual, you know, guidelines to what is, you know, obscene and, you know, basically

662
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:43,460
not meant for kids. It's kind of like the same law that the normal other media like

663
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:50,060
TV and movies go by. So that one's pretty good. And that one actually got signed into

664
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,260
law. So that's always good. And I think they did the same thing in Maryland actually with

665
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:02,680
that kind of law where basically, you know, falls under the obscenity laws. I don't know.

666
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,800
So is this going off the ESRB or what's going to determine? It's basically they have the

667
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:18,240
guidelines. What it is is if the material incites or appeals or is designed to incite

668
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,500
or appeal to the, I hate law terminology, it's so stupid. But anyways, it's basically

669
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,140
if it's like obscenely offensive if like the game is you know baby raper 2000 or something

670
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,640
like that you know that's not going to be they'll have the right to you know pull that

671
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,340
off the shelves i i would want to try out baby raper 2000 before i start knocking on

672
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:46,880
it though it could be interesting just kidding jesus god all right anyway so basically it's

673
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,260
you know if it's harmful to minors and i think that they're gonna go by the esrbs you know

674
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,880
reading system for this. I'm not sure, you know, because to be honest, they can take

675
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,380
laws nowadays and just spin them any way that, you know, benefits them. And of course, Jackie

676
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,100
Poo hasn't really said anything on this yet, because I remember that was his law that actually

677
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,780
got, you know, temporarily restrained. So, it should be interesting.

678
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,780
Well, I guess if the ESA isn't arguing with it, then I guess I can go for that.

679
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Yeah.

680
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:24,100
Well, you know what I think is also pretty ridiculous though is that actually the parents

681
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:34,100
television council is actually pretty upset about the ESRB's commitment to parents campaign.

682
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,820
Oh, what was this, the ESRB, that's right, they started this campaign about how they're

683
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,540
committed to, I seem to remember reading some stuff on this.

684
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,180
Working with Penny Arcade and having them do the ads.

685
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,320
So who's got sand in their vagina about it?

686
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,340
Basically Tim Winter who is the executive director basically said in his press release

687
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,620
to quote yet another dodge by the video game industry to avoid accountability for the harm

688
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,980
it inflicts on children.

689
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:12,020
What they don't seem to understand is that it isn't the industry's job to protect their

690
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,020
children.

691
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:20,020
It's the parent's job to protect their children by limiting, you know, another facility's

692
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:27,340
free speech. They're, you know, they're basically passing on the responsibility that they agreed

693
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:32,940
to as parents to another facility. Now, I do agree that, you know, at a certain age

694
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,940
there are certain things you should not be exposed to. However, when you have a child,

695
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,200
you accept the responsibility of guarding your children from those things

696
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:50,980
that you don't want them to see and this is just them not wanting to take

697
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,340
responsibility for what they need to be doing they want to put the blame on

698
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,340
somebody else instead of their own failures that's how I see it I would

699
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,640
love to get that guy on this program we should say that I we should send an

700
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,620
email well you know I think we should I'm all for lately why don't you want

701
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,620
you work on?

702
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,620
Why don't you...

703
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,620
I will work on trying to get him on.

704
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,240
Did you like how I passed the buck there?

705
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Like I said, let's interview him.

706
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
Jamie, you do it.

707
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,580
I'll table it for future discussion.

708
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
Alright, sounds good.

709
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
We'll make an action item of it.

710
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:24,040
Alright, you know this whole topic, these politics and the ignorant people when it comes

711
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,340
to video games and all that stuff.

712
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,740
By the way, for those of you guys listening live tonight, unfortunately it's not gonna

713
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,100
make the podcast because we have to do a little bit of copyrighted material with it, but we

714
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,520
We got a real treat for you in the bonus segment tonight, and this is just going to totally

715
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,220
support this point for those of you guys listening live tonight, and unfortunately I wish I had

716
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,180
something better to say for those of you guys on the podcast, I guess it's just an incentive

717
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,180
to listen live once in a while.

718
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,820
Anyway, this whole topic, I don't know about you guys, but it gets me a little pissed off,

719
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,460
and you know what happens when we get pissed off?

720
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,340
People die, and the FUs of the week are brought upon us.

721
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:07,340
them must destroy them all.

722
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:20,060
So, my F.U. of the week goes toward the stupid drunk girl from last night.

723
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,220
I was, I basically, I took my friend Julie to Berkeley yesterday for her

724
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,620
birthday.

725
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,760
You know, because I wasn't going to get to hang out with her tonight for her birthday party.

726
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,720
And we had a good time.

727
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,680
I was really, really worn out and tired, you know, on the way home, so I dropped Julie off

728
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,620
and rested for a little bit at her house so that I'd have enough energy to get home.

729
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,960
And as I was approaching one of the major intersections for anybody who's

730
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,460
in the Sacramento area or who has been here is when you're going

731
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:55,420
down White Avenue toward the interstate on-ramp right before Marconi.

732
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:02,420
Basically, this girl, I was in the far left lane, there was a lane between us, and there was a girl in the far right lane, ahead of me.

733
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:14,420
And she suddenly spins out of control and heard little Mini Cooper, and spun right, and then swerved around left and just went into a full 360 in the middle of the road, and was heading directly for me.

734
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:23,420
And I threw on my brakes and swerved, and she did the same, and we actually avoided a head-on collision by less than 4 inches.

735
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,860
so uh yeah it was pretty scary so uh

736
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,540
did your whole life flash before your eyes and all that stuff?

737
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,700
I think my brain shut down I was so

738
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,460
I was tired already you know but I I was good to get home

739
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,980
this just had my adrenaline going so bad which actually I'm supposed to avoid

740
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:47,380
you know by my doctor's orders but anyway I pulled up ahead I watched from my rear view mirror to see

741
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,220
what was going on

742
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,760
she she turned around and started heading up so I just decided just to go

743
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,100
home because I was too

744
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:58,060
shaken up by it cuz I mean I mean I had headlights flashed in my eyes it was

745
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,620
pretty scary I can't let this comment in chat go by Jamie you got it you got to

746
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,340
hear this one Jeremy Todd one says Jamie you have a lot of close calls and

747
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,900
traffic maybe you're actually the one that's a bad driver no trust me I'm not

748
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,580
the one who drives drunk who spins out in the middle of the road I'm not the

749
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:22,260
one who bumped into a couple other cars no this I it was actually my good

750
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,660
driving that saved my life only when she's playing Mario Kart is she a bad

751
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,420
driver Mario Kart whatever what did what driving use do you play any driving

752
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:40,260
games no anyway I got up to one of the lights a few blocks up and a guy in a

753
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,160
Camaro who I knew was a little bit behind me in the other lane pulled up and

754
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,620
said hey what happened what happened and then she pulled up next to him so he

755
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,180
just turned and talked to her like what were you thinking what was going on

756
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,180
What's wrong?

757
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:03,140
That's by the way exactly what she sounded like I'm not joking and he's like are you drunk and she's

758
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:11,700
Just you know dark Sakura fire boma and Chad is backing you up saying it's because she lives in California kids

759
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,540
Seriously people here can't drive. They really can't know they can or they can they in a certain parts of Georgia. Isn't that right?

760
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:29,460
I should have stopped and got her license plate number but honestly I was like I'm getting

761
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:36,160
away from her and just shot up onto the freeway and went home but that was seriously really

762
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,580
scary it's why you know you've got the oh don't drink and drive like don't do it if

763
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:50,880
do you are fucking retard if you have it takes for I think a double shot of

764
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,320
liquor depending on your metabolism to you by the way but for a double shot of

765
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,120
liquor it takes about three hours to get it fully out of your system for a beer

766
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:04,440
it's about the same she her eyes were so dilated it wasn't funny I could see from

767
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,920
from you two lanes over Marin and chat says she plays Derby owners Club that's

768
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:18,640
kind of like driving right guys guys beating my horse all right and everybody who drives drunk

769
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:27,360
a big humongous porkin fuck you i hope that you get arrested all right loki um i kind of have

770
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,280
just you know the whole story reminds me of the time that i was driving

771
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,360
don't ask me why to play ddr like midnight over at you know ccl you know country club

772
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:42,160
lanes the ultra ghetto bowling alley that had the DVR but it's open 24 hours a day anyways

773
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,400
that was a long time ago but there's this guy who was in a van who um swerved across all the traffic

774
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,960
and swerved back over and went on the off-ramp but except for making the turn for the off-ramp

775
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,240
just kind of jumped over the lane and kind of drove off road for a little bit that was funny

776
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,000
because i was like i'm all and that guy's like not really you know paying attention where he's

777
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,920
going i'm like whoa oh he just went over the edge but that's funny but um okay yeah on tephews um

778
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:13,260
Um, fuck you to stupid 24 hour fitness, because I went and signed up, I mean granted this

779
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:19,340
is how every single place is, where they have your sign up fee or whatever, and then they

780
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,420
have a processing fee of like $70.

781
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:28,780
What exactly are they doing for that $70, because I saw her process the account and

782
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:35,100
basically type it into a computer for about one minute, so that was $77 worth of work

783
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:42,100
right there? I don't think so. And by the way, for $77 she needs to learn how to type.

784
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:48,720
My F.U. goes to that great big ball of fire in the sky, the sun. I went to a theme park

785
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,420
in the Bay Area called Great America yesterday to kind of celebrate my birthday with some

786
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,020
friends. And I, believe me, I'm not stupid, I put sunscreen like all over, all over, you

787
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:04,460
know, just SPF 60 because I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to get burned up. However,

788
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,980
It didn't really occur to me that, oh Rob, you have spiky hair now?

789
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,580
You should probably put some sunblock on your scalp, because basically what I ended up with

790
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:18,660
is a sunburned scalp, and you can see a little bit of the redness there here in studio, where

791
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,340
basically the top of my head got sunburned.

792
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,700
So F you to the sun for burning people, that's not a nice thing to do to the creatures of

793
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,700
the earth.

794
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,420
Uh, Magus, we'll give you one quick F you if you got one.

795
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:35,620
Alright and this is not normally something I F you, but this is the first time I'm going

796
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,620
to hear this.

797
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:43,620
F you to Blizzard in the 1.11 patch that just came out on Tuesday.

798
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:49,100
They added new content, next ramus, that kind of stuff, revamped a lot of things, mage and

799
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:55,100
shaman talent reviews, but they made one crucial error, they made the looking for group channel

800
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:03,740
global across the entire population of the server uh while players if you know goldshire if you know

801
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:10,300
baron's chat it's now across the entire server don't even try to use the lfg channel to lfg

802
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:17,500
see they had failed to take into account how utterly stupid 95% of their player base is

803
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
I

804
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,560
Wondered why that channel was

805
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:28,380
Frickin off the charts in chat. I'm like there cannot be this many people looking for like, you know

806
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:35,820
Rage fire chasm and dead mines in silver pine forest. I'm like what the hell is wrong. Okay, that makes sense

807
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,820
Wow, that was stupid of blizzard

808
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,940
Good job guys

809
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,900
All right. Wow, that was like our longest fu segment ever. I'm sorry you guys

810
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,620
all right, I

811
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:50,640
I wanted to say real quick before we get back into the news, to follow up to the chat question

812
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,640
earlier, how much does an original Xbox cost?

813
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,760
Here's the weird thing, I've gone to like five different sites, I'm not able to find

814
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,280
a new Xbox, did they stop making them and I just forgot they did?

815
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:08,760
I guess then here's the deal, you can get them on gamestop.com and I imagine EB as well,

816
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,600
a refurb system is $99 for most of the used ones, you can get a factory refurb for $120

817
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:22,600
$99.99, but it looks like if you want a new one from Microsoft themselves, Tough Poop.

818
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Tough Poopy. Oh man. Anyways, so yeah, that kind of sucks that you can't get those. I

819
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,400
know that they stopped making them for a little bit, but one of the games that you will be

820
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,920
able to play on the Xbox as well as the Xbox 360, or at least I think it's going to be

821
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,440
on the Xbox, maybe not. Need for Speed Carbon, which should be just called Need for Speed

822
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,480
Carbon Copy because it looks very similar to Most Wanted, although they're saying that

823
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,260
it's going to be more like Underground 2. Whatever the case, one of the things that

824
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,380
they did post on Game Informer's website was a sneak peek at the trailer for it, which

825
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:06,000
basically shows canyon runs that are being done in the middle of the night. And apparently

826
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,840
this is going to be part of the game where you can basically race on these really narrow

827
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:15,520
circuits alongside deadly pitfalls and if you drift too far you will fly over the edge

828
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:22,960
and die. But anyways, so they're trying to make it seems like more like maybe Initial

829
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,280
D-ish if you know if racing along twisting highways and stuff. But I did see some other

830
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,900
screenshots which looks like it's going to be also more city racing. Expect this to be

831
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,940
be like any other Need for Speed game out there.

832
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,580
I just have a real quick thing to interject before we move on. Why is it that Wang Gan

833
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,780
has not come out for a console anywhere? Midnight Maximum Tune, you know the whole spiel there.

834
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,500
Like, top ten soundtracks of all time, for me, honestly. I love the soundtrack to that game.

835
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,820
And you know what I do, is I actually load it on, or I have some of the tracks loaded,

836
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:59,060
I want to get the whole soundtrack loaded on my computer to use when I play Burnout.

837
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:05,560
You know, screw EA tracks. I want my, you know, Yuzo Koshiro tracks playing when I play Burnout. It's awesome.

838
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,060
I don't know why I decided to interject that there, but why won't that stinking game come out on console?

839
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,060
I'm sick of all these other series. I want that game.

840
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,060
They have Tokyo Extreme Racers supposed to be coming out.

841
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:19,060
That's probably as close as you're gonna get it. I don't know why.

842
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
It would make sense.

843
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,060
Weird.

844
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,060
Especially with all that drift culture stuff nowadays.

845
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,560
I know with the Fast and the Furious Tokyo drifting or whatever that thing is.

846
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:33,140
I love how the commercials for that totally spoiled the like after-credits ending thing I

847
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,600
Didn't even bother I could care less Loki. I could care less by the movie. All right. Anyway, sorry

848
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:45,700
Well to cleanse the palette of drifting. We actually have some confirmation by

849
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,460
Uchiyama Daisuke who is

850
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,820
Namco Bandai's chief producer

851
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:56,100
stating that there will be both Tekken and Soul Calibur games being worked on

852
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:01,620
on the... well they're not saying specifically what system it's going to be on, but we are

853
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:06,660
going to get a new Soul Calibur, a new Tekken, and the guess is that it will be PS3.

854
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:14,780
Especially since there was already some sort of tech demo for Tekken on PS3 already.

855
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,980
That's right, I seem to remember something at Sony's press conference too about that whole

856
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:24,980
And Soul Calibur 3 was a Playstation 2 exclusive, so that would seem to indicate maybe it will

857
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,980
continue.

858
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:31,980
I don't know, I like what they did with Soul Calibur 2, with the different special

859
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,740
characters on different systems, because we actually own all of them.

860
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,740
Pantsless Pope?

861
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:42,140
That was pretty awesome, the Pope character that had no pants that I made.

862
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:48,920
Here's the thing though, I think Soul Calibur 2 is more of a memorable game.

863
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,120
When we look back on gaming history now, I think I will think of Soul Calibur 2 before

864
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,040
I think of Soul Calibur 3.

865
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,840
Don't get me wrong, Soul Calibur 3 is a solid game, but I think just because of all those

866
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:06,240
mixed releases they did, the arcade release, Soul Calibur 2 is just much more of a big

867
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,440
release than Soul Calibur 3.

868
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,660
And I'm hoping that Soul Calibur IV can maybe, you know, live up to that bar that Soul Calibur

869
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,660
II set.

870
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,440
You know, it's hard to say that Soul Calibur III didn't live up to the bar, but in some

871
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,440
ways it didn't.

872
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,360
Even though it was like a great game, it wasn't a, when I look back in 15 years I'm gonna

873
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,520
remember this next to Soul Calibur II type game.

874
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,520
I don't know.

875
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
Maybe you guys feel differently.

876
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
Do you, Chatroom?

877
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,520
I don't know.

878
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
I don't know.

879
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,080
I think Soul Calibur, I don't know, I think Soul Calibur III didn't do as well as II.

880
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:42,920
Especially the fact when you release something on one system as opposed to three, you're

881
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,760
obviously going to get less sales.

882
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,040
And now of course we have the chat room is lighting up with some feedback there, which

883
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,520
is what I was hoping here.

884
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,000
Jeremy Todd 1 says, Link on Soul Calibur 2 rocked my socks.

885
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,840
That's one reason many people are going to remember Soul Calibur 2 was the addition of

886
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:02,680
Link, which seemed so random at the time, but just was awesome for the GameCube owners.

887
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,620
Bandit says, you know what, Tekken is so much better than Soul Calibur, so he's more excited

888
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,460
about the Tekken game that's coming out on PS3.

889
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,780
And Dark Knight says, hey, what about the original, Soul Edge?

890
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:17,380
You know, honestly, when you look at this, it's kind of like when you look at any series.

891
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:22,780
Like for me anyway, like I remember, you know, Zelda on the Super Nintendo almost more than

892
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,780
I do the original.

893
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,780
Well, that's not true.

894
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,660
I do have a lot of love for the original, so I'm trying to think of a series that's

895
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,380
kind of like where one of the sequels stands out more than maybe the original does.

896
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,360
How about Castlevania, okay?

897
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,120
Like you think about, you know, when I look at the series, Symphony of the Night was like

898
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,660
the game that will just, I don't think any other Castlevania game they ever released

899
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,720
will come close to the greatness of Symphony of the Night, even more so than the original

900
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,720
for me.

901
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,600
So, I don't know, that's kind of how I feel about Soul Calibur, but I'm sure you guys

902
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,680
feel differently, but we've all got opinions.

903
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,240
Anyway, another game that had tons and tons and tons of sequels was King's Quest.

904
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,360
Remember this whole game, King's Quest?

905
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,840
on the PC years ago Roberta Williams King Quest and they had you know five

906
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,240
and six for some of the first games on CD-ROM well they went back Sierra and

907
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,160
they remade one and two a while ago and they gave them fancy VGA graphics but

908
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,080
one game they never really went back and upgraded that much was King's Quest 3 so

909
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:23,760
what's happened is that the fans and I you remember a while back when we had we

910
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,200
even had some of the King's Quest fan community on here and they were they

911
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,960
were making like the the fan game in the series all that I mean King's Quest fans

912
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,880
are passionate about these games and this just goes to prove it King's Quest 3 to

913
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:40,040
air as human has been remade and this has been remade by Infamous Adventures

914
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:45,720
and this remake features all new VGA backgrounds, enhanced close-up cutscenes,

915
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,320
dialogue portraits for all the characters, original music by a

916
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:54,640
professional composer, a full speech pack, and a new point-and-click interface.

917
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:02,020
Basically, Infamous Adventures believes this game is still relevant, and no profit is being

918
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,140
made off the game.

919
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:08,460
You can download it free of charge, 43.2 megabytes is how big the game is.

920
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,060
It's at Infamous-Adventures.com.

921
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,740
And honestly guys, if you don't have GameTap, because GameTap has a lot of the King's Quest

922
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:19,580
games in there, I would highly recommend you guys check this out.

923
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,900
I'm just going to assume it's like the original.

924
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,060
I haven't had a chance to check it out myself yet, I want to.

925
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:27,280
I would highly recommend you download it as quick as possible because it'll probably be

926
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,180
pulled off

927
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,620
by some copyright. Well now that one person's downloaded it, it'll forever be floating in the

928
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,600
internet somewhere

929
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:38,000
So, you know, check this out. King's Quest was a great series of games.

930
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,020
King's Quest was pretty cool. I just, you know,

931
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,700
I couldn't get into it too much, but I think I want to play Peasant's Quest.

932
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,680
Peasant's Quest? What?

933
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,100
On the Homestar Runner site. Oh, you know, actually I would...

934
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,540
I'm you, Trogdor!

935
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:58,500
I think the easiest one to get into out of the series, and I don't know, King's Quest

936
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,340
Hardcore fans may disagree with me, but I think King's Quest IV, the one with the...

937
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,540
I actually tried to start with King's Quest V and I couldn't get into it.

938
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,540
Really?

939
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,500
And Magus, you're saying V, why?

940
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,660
I'm saying V because I got started on the series on NES and it was the first King's

941
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,660
Quest release that I got to play.

942
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:20,700
Unfortunately I didn't really get into it past V, but I did get to go into the previous

943
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:26,440
games a little bit, so I got to start on 5, so I think it was the easiest for me.

944
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,240
Alright, going to the chat room for some quick feedback before we move on here.

945
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,360
VidPowah says, I'd like to point out that while Sierra did remake KQ1, it was a total

946
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,520
market failure.

947
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,080
AGD took over the reins of remaking it, and for free.

948
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,560
I guess that's kind of an interesting point there.

949
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,560
I think Sierra had a couple of their old games remade back in the day.

950
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:51,180
And then, let's see, some folks, Sexy Stalker is commenting, shameless game tap plug.

951
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,320
They don't pay us, you know, we just think they do have a pretty interesting service,

952
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,420
but it's really up to you guys if you want it or not.

953
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,820
And then, Gamerman55 in chat says, Sky, we want some real news, not old games.

954
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,820
You know what, though?

955
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,920
Even though, yes, this is an old game, I think this speaks more volumes about what fan communities

956
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,860
in the gaming world are capable of doing.

957
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:14,600
I mean, it is not an easy task to remake a game with graphics.

958
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:18,880
I know I sure as hell couldn't program it, so I think it is kind of noteworthy when these

959
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,200
gaming fan communities go, you know, over and above the Call of Fandom.

960
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,360
Speaking of which, there has been another remake that's kind of been a little off the

961
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,760
radar.

962
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:39,200
A lot of FPS fans know that when Valve released Half-Life 2, they redid Half-Life 1 for the

963
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:45,480
source engine, and it had quite a few problems with the new source physics engine. There's

964
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,800
actually a fan group, I can't remember the site right now, but there's a fan group dedicated

965
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,940
to completely redoing, remaking the original Half-Life in the source engine, and they're

966
01:03:54,940 --> 01:04:00,320
calling Black Mesa Source. I believe they're still in the planning stages, but they're

967
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:05,680
working on getting all the voice actors, the texture maps, completely redoing the maps

968
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,400
making it uh... a better experience

969
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,280
so uh... if you have the time you might want to check that out as well

970
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,380
I'd like to see remade in the source engine

971
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,880
Duke Nukem 3D

972
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,000
you know there's loving a game and then there's

973
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,440
looooooving a game I mean these guys love their game

974
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,980
anyway

975
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,280
I have release dates

976
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,440
alright so speaking of games

977
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,740
some non-fan games and some of these are

978
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,260
Well, these games may have fans very soon.

979
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:41,500
Actually, one of the titles surprises me because I thought you couldn't use Ninja in a title

980
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,580
in the UK, but I guess you can.

981
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,420
It's coming out on the 30th, a whole crap load of games.

982
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:49,100
We have Shinobi Doule of the Ninja.

983
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:55,540
We have Over-G Fighters on Xbox 360, New Super Mario Bros., Micro Machines, Flatout 2, Devil

984
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:03,720
May Cry 3 Special Edition, Def Jam Fight for New York, Brick Em All, we've also got Super

985
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,420
Monkey Ball Adventure, Swords of Destiny, Siphon Filter, Dark Mirror, Titan Quest, Untold

986
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,560
Legends, The Warrior Code, and also before that on the 29th is Panzer Command Operation

987
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,620
Winter Storm on PC.

988
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,620
Excellent.

989
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,380
How about in the U.S.?

990
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,780
U.S., not a whole lot, but if you're a Pirates of the Caribbean fan and you happen to have

991
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,100
a portable console, then you'll be happy to know that Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's

992
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:35,380
Chest has arrived. Um, actually I played a little bit of it at E3. It is pretty good.

993
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:41,020
I don't know, it's your typical, you know, action game. Anyways, um, Micro Machines though

994
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:46,820
is coming out on PlayStation 2, Micro Machines Volume 4, as well as the PSP. Are Micro Machines

995
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:51,960
still around? I don't know. What the hell? Magus is shaking his head no. But the game

996
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,980
looks fun I don't know okay yeah it's fun who cares well no we're to ultimate

997
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:02,760
ninja for the you enemy fighting fans also let's see here rough trigger the

998
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,500
Vanna core conspiracy which is some weird budget game where you play a

999
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:14,960
werewolf um you know what I believe there is one 360 game which was over G

1000
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,960
fighters is coming out this week which is supposed to be kind of like ace

1001
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:24,840
combat, but I don't know, not a whole lot. Not a whole lot at all. It's a slow period

1002
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:30,840
for games though. Sudoku Gridmaster, that was the other one. Whoopee! But it's by Nintendo.

1003
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,280
I'm... I don't know. I'm burned out on Sudoku. If you own a GameCube though, nada anything

1004
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:45,560
for you. You suck. That's what your retails says. But anyways, you know, we can't be all

1005
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:52,560
I still gotta buy my copy of Crusty Demons so I can come over and play it.

1006
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,520
But one of the games I will not be buying is the 10th anniversary edition of Tomb Raider

1007
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,720
because I honestly hate Tomb Raider.

1008
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,920
But you know what?

1009
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,780
It is confirmed though, Eidos has come out and said they are remaking the very first

1010
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,780
Tomb Raider.

1011
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:10,520
It's supposed to be arriving on the Playstation 2, PSP, and PC.

1012
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,600
No word yet when, but it's coming soon.

1013
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:20,660
So for all you fans of Tomb Raider out there, and I don't know why, but it's coming out

1014
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,660
soon.

1015
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:27,340
Well you know, one way that Tomb Raider became ultra-famous was because it had a movie made

1016
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:33,060
out of it, and usually movies are made out of famous games, but this game was a little

1017
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:39,060
more B-list or C-list even, it was more of a cult game, Clock Tower, remember Clock Tower?

1018
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:43,460
Now Clock Tower is kind of cool because, you know, gory, gory murder and the scissors and

1019
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,940
all that scary stuff.

1020
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,300
However what's interesting about it is that it is being made into a movie.

1021
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:53,700
Jorge Olguin is heading up the Clock Tower movie project.

1022
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,500
Basically what's happening is that the person who wrote When a Stranger Calls is writing

1023
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,780
a script for this movie.

1024
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:06,460
It's I believe Jason Wade Wall is the name of this guy and production is going to start

1025
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,420
on the Clock Tower movie this fall.

1026
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,620
Hopefully the movie will be better than when a stranger calls.

1027
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:16,420
Why do people have to pick all this really non-mainstream stuff to make movies out of?

1028
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,420
You know what though? I think it's about the source material for some people, you know?

1029
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,420
If a good movie can be made out of this, and I think it can,

1030
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:27,420
I think a real scary movie could be made from this pre-

1031
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,420
I mean, it's a pretty scary game. I've only played a little, little bit of Clock Tower.

1032
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,420
I had a bunch of sequels. Like, wasn't there at least a Clock Tower 3?

1033
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,420
You were playing Clock Tower 3, weren't you?

1034
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,100
else that I knew, but I've seen the whole first part of Clock Tower 3. No, last time

1035
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:43,780
I touched Clock Tower was before we were even doing the show, probably. I want a Contra

1036
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:50,940
movie. I want, I want, Gimme Gimme Gimme. I want a Silent Hill sequel. Well, you may

1037
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:55,540
get it. I think they broke box office, I don't know, who knows. Who knows, but at the very

1038
01:08:55,540 --> 01:09:01,560
least though, for the July 8th opening in Japan, they actually have a Silent Hill haunted

1039
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:09,920
house called Shocking House that's up from July 2nd with hours 11am to 6pm for our listeners

1040
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,480
in Japan.

1041
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,800
And the movie, like I said, opens on July 8th.

1042
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:20,960
There was actually a big press conference out where they had someone dressed up as a

1043
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,520
red pyramid and a bunch of, you know, nurses sort of slumped over.

1044
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:35,740
And there's also a nice quote from Akira Yamaoka saying that the aim was to make something

1045
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:41,760
enjoyable even if the viewer wasn't familiar with the game, which actually I think did

1046
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,120
a pretty admirable job.

1047
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,120
I'm hoping that the movie does pretty well in Japan, too.

1048
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:49,900
I didn't realize that the movie hadn't come out in Japan yet.

1049
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,280
That was kind of the most surprising thing to me.

1050
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,240
I thought they got it the same time we did, so I was kind of surprised they still hadn't

1051
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,240
seen it.

1052
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:04,920
Usually, I think that it's a difference of, I want to say, one to three months, I think,

1053
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:12,280
for a movie that's released in the U.S. to go through, not just translation, localization,

1054
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,960
but also for the recording of their dub script.

1055
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,880
Oh, I would have thought they would have taken care of all that in advance, but I guess that

1056
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,880
kind of surprised me.

1057
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,120
You know what's interesting though, before we change topics, I thought it was interesting

1058
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,320
because I've been kind of I was reading about this on some various gaming blogs

1059
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,040
and I noticed the Silent Hill movie was getting a lot of crap like that it

1060
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,280
wasn't a great movie and I understand where people didn't like it maybe the

1061
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,400
ones who hadn't played the games but I actually thought as far as video game

1062
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,240
movies go Silent Hill was actually probably one of the best if not the best

1063
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:46,880
video game movie we've had so far so I don't know why there's this sudden

1064
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,480
backlash because it seems like when the movie first came out these same sites

1065
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:56,840
We're like pyramid head is awesome. You know, I I was a little surprised by the sudden backlash where it's cool to hate on Silent Hill

1066
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,440
I think it's just I don't understand what the whole trend is with these

1067
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,820
Movie viewers who are looking for like a Oscar

1068
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,140
Quality acting in these movies. I mean first off where are you the judge?

1069
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,400
you know, what is Oscar quality acting in the first place and

1070
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,400
To why the hell would you go to a movie like that anyways expecting that you know

1071
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:22,040
it's not going to be there you go there because you want to see pyramid head slice people in half

1072
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:27,000
that's that's basically why you would go that didn't quite happen but you know you still got

1073
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,800
cool pyramid head yeah you got you know it's a horror movie horror movies are supposed to be

1074
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:39,080
campy and bloody that's what they are i mean they're not like i don't know it's not casablanca

1075
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:44,680
with blood i mean it's just a movie uh lots of feedback in our chat room and then we'll get

1076
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,520
Actually, Magus, do you want to comment first?

1077
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,520
People who expect a lot out of video game movies, just be grateful that it's not like

1078
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,520
Wing Commander.

1079
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,520
VXJ6V says, Silent Hill was an awesome movie.

1080
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,640
Jeremy Todd 1 says, you know, it's because of the hype of the movie.

1081
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,680
When they just got back from seeing it, they were all like, OMG, that was so awesome.

1082
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,200
Then a month or two later, yeah, that movie sucked.

1083
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,260
SSJ100Matt says, who are you to judge?

1084
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,600
It's not Oscar quality.

1085
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:21,600
It's not what typically gets nominated for an Oscar. You don't really see horror movies up there too often.

1086
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,600
I think that it was really good. I think that the acting in it was pretty darn good, especially since they had the Borg Queen.

1087
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,600
Oh, she was so cool.

1088
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,600
I think some people are kind of pissed off by the second half of the movie, which involved the Borg Queen character,

1089
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:41,600
but at the same time, you know, a movie is very hard to do with, you know, one person.

1090
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,760
I don't know if the only movie I can think of that's really pulled it off is like some

1091
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,620
of the Alien movies, but I don't know.

1092
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,620
I wasn't mad by the movie.

1093
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,620
I thought it was great.

1094
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,620
Anyway.

1095
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,620
I don't know.

1096
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,620
Could have been worse.

1097
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,620
Exactly.

1098
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,460
You know, all these people being critical on stuff.

1099
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:02,820
One person though that was critical on things would be, or I should say one site, somethingawful.com.

1100
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,060
They are always ripping apart bad movies, which I might add, all those bad movies I

1101
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,660
tend to buy because they read them bad.

1102
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,660
So you kind of go to something awful dot com and use that as your checklist of what to

1103
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,660
buy?

1104
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,660
Exactly.

1105
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,660
Because I have a My Bad Movie collection.

1106
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,660
That's interesting.

1107
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:16,660
That's interesting.

1108
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:21,660
But one person though, it goes back to last week, you know the whole Ooey Bowl challenging

1109
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,060
critics of his movies.

1110
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:31,680
Well it was interesting to note, Rich Kianka of something awful dot com who goes by Lotax,

1111
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:37,820
he actually wrote Ooey Bowl to see if he could be able to fight him.

1112
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:43,800
Now interesting note, he has not, as of writing that letter, he had not written anything bad

1113
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,560
about, you know, Weeble's movies, but Weeble said, yeah, sure, go ahead.

1114
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:55,200
So he decided to go ahead and officially write a review for House of the Dead which, or Alone

1115
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
in the Dark I should say.

1116
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:03,940
House of the Dead one's coming later and yeah, it's just basically a really bad movie.

1117
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:09,060
But um, it's interesting to see though that he kind of bent the rules to be able to fight

1118
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,580
this guy.

1119
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,860
So that is one person that he will be fighting.

1120
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,540
So maybe I can do it.

1121
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:20,660
More people probably read somethingawful.com than actually went and saw Blood Rain.

1122
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:24,980
So you know, Uwe Boll probably has something to win from this.

1123
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:29,540
You know, it's so interesting because I don't like Uwe Boll's movies.

1124
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:35,100
I mean I understand how bad they are and how they might be funny to watch just you know

1125
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,420
pointing out all the flaws in them.

1126
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,740
I kind of want to see Postal now.

1127
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:43,500
I kind of want to see it just because you can't really mess up Postal.

1128
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,600
There's no plot to it.

1129
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,220
It's just basically violence.

1130
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:50,900
It's got Gary Coleman in it which that's awesome right there and it's going to have a boxing

1131
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,620
match with Uwe Boll and a bunch of movie critics at the end.

1132
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,500
I mean that sounds cool.

1133
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,020
I think it could work.

1134
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:01,780
You know, more people are probably interested in seeing Lotex get his ass beat, and before

1135
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:08,220
I say that, I'm not slamming something awful, I'm not a goon yet, but there are people out

1136
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:12,100
on the internet that would love to see Lotex get his ass beat, especially by Uwe Boll.

1137
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,020
See I think this is what Uwe Boll needs to do.

1138
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:19,060
He needs to get out of the video game movie thing and just start making mindlessly violent

1139
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,940
or cheesy campy movies.

1140
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,840
Because he's got the kind of thing down with, you know, Alone in the Dark and stuff.

1141
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,980
Just make your own source material, that way people can't say, oh, it's not even near the

1142
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:31,980
game or something like that.

1143
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:37,460
That's what he needs to do, because he doesn't understand how to make good movies, so make

1144
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:43,480
campy, crappy movies that have a lot of B actors in it, and just go crazy with that.

1145
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,800
Snakes on a Plane is a perfect example of something you can do to that effect, but just

1146
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,120
go crazy with it.

1147
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,600
That's where some of the best movies out there are movies that don't make sense, like giant

1148
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,280
crickets attacking the earth, that doesn't make any sense.

1149
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,960
they're they're good to watch

1150
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,280
uh... g k one twenty eight seems to back up what you're saying loki says uh...

1151
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,700
postal will be awful but at least we'll expect it

1152
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,040
exactly if it's if there's

1153
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,680
guy gets angry goes kill things i mean

1154
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,500
pretty simple to me i don't know

1155
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,240
i don't know it worked for what was that uh... movie

1156
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,080
shoot now i can remember falling down falling down

1157
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,080
I like that falling down was a good movie

1158
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:30,980
If he makes it like falling down then I'll go see it. Honestly, though if we bowl if we bowls

1159
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:35,940
Postal was playing next door to another fucking Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock movie

1160
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:41,140
I would rather if forced to gunpoint go see the Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock movie than that

1161
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,900
So I mean so how fast I don't want in other words

1162
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,740
I really just don't want to see postal how fast does the lake house have to be traveling before it?

1163
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,500
so doesn't explode I

1164
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,840
I think we need a break now.

1165
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,840
Yes, please.

1166
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,840
Speed 4.

1167
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,840
Let's cleanse the palate.

1168
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:02,420
So, we'll be back very shortly with more of episode 188 of Orange Lounge Radio.
