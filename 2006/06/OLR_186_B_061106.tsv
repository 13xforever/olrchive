19963	21904	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21984	26087	Here it is, episode number 186 for this June the 11th of 2006.
27207	31290	And Loki's going to start off this set with a piece of news about the PlayStation 3.
32091	33651	Yes, ooh, the PlayStation 3.
34692	42357	Basically, they're saying that the early units are going to have the hardware to play the original, or the PlayStation 2 stuff.
42377	45999	So they're going to have PlayStation 2 hardware inside to be able to play the older games.
46479	48821	And later, as time goes on, and they've
49534	49794	and so on.
70630	70990	I don't know.
71471	74913	This time around, though, it's going to be more hardware than just one chip.
76114	77935	But you could upscale on the original plate.
77955	79696	You could do the faster loading and all that stuff.
79716	83719	Yeah, but the thing is they have the original chip in there to be able to do that.
83759	89763	It's just like this is going to have the PlayStation 2 hardware built in, but you can still upscale that.
90344	91424	That doesn't have anything to do with it.
92145	95287	But later on, they're going to be going completely software with this.
96355	103643	So this means that it's going to be even more hardware crammed inside of this thing, and as it is, I think they're having trouble fitting in the hardware in that case.
103723	108468	I mean, it's going to end up being larger than the original Xbox by the time they're done with it.
109009	109529	Oh, we'll see.
109709	110130	You never know.
110814	113536	Watch JP had an interview with Ken Kutaragi regarding the PlayStation 3.
128586	135152	Basically what happened is that the PlayStation 3 is, Kudaragi calls it a configuration, not a model.
135473	142639	He says Sony wants to upgrade all aspects of the console as time goes on, like the hard drive size, maybe even the CPU specs.
143280	146803	Sony may release an upgraded version of the console every year.
147964	151167	And Sony is really not thinking about the price or anything here.
151227	152488	Here's the direct quote.
153092	156313	I think it's okay to release an extended configuration every year, laugh.
156473	159314	Though I say it like a joke, Dell will do it and Apple will do it too.
159714	162995	In PC, if you fix the spec for two years, you'll be caught up.
163495	164935	Computers should be changing, right?
165035	167976	It's inevitable that 60 gigabytes will become short.
168336	169637	Memory may become short too.
169677	170857	There are many possibilities.
171817	174298	So in other words, if you become an early adopter of the PlayStation 3...
175211	177332	You may get screwed on this stuff.
178372	179412	It's a console.
179512	180533	It's not a PC.
180613	185234	I know they're thinking it's a PC, but if it's a PC, then get into the goddamn PC market.
185274	186815	Don't try to push this crap.
187015	188175	It's not a fucking VAIO.
188495	190116	It's a goddamn PlayStation.
190176	193377	Well, DarkSakura might have more info here on what Sony's thinking.
194317	195018	I just might.
196838	202340	Basically, Sony's basically going off about
202799	203019	DarkSakura,
214965	229229	When they brought it out in Europe, basically trying to push it as a computer and not as a game console, they were saying that basically importing game consoles into the European Union is a huge tax drain where computers are not.
229329	233311	So they wanted to get out of paying the taxes that they actually released Linux for the PS2.
236852	244014	So basically, the theory is that they're trying to do that again and we might even see Linux for the PS3.
244904	245565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
265273	265913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
297431	300193	Moving on, let's move over to the Nintendo Wii.
300273	302635	There was some more news on the Virtual Console this week, right, Loki?
302755	303596	Yes, that's correct.
304296	320027	Actually, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata, he announced, or basically outlined the price ranges of some of the games that are going to be on the Virtual Console for lease and download in Japan.
320607	324270	He says they're going to be anywhere between 500 yen and 1,000 yen, and basically that
327046	329867	is the equivalent of about $4.50 to $8.99 in the US.
330107	332088	Yeah, that won't translate exactly, though.
332128	336129	I would say $5 and $10, basically, to be competitive with Xbox Live.
336469	337890	Maybe $4 and $8.
338170	340671	They might try to undercut Xbox Live a little bit, who knows?
342111	347093	Or do the old $0.99 for $4.99 and $9.99 and all that stuff.
347714	353316	I wouldn't see, with some of these games, even their first party games or whatever, they could really do $0.99.
353356	353556	I mean,
356107	365751	The thing is, is the Nintendo console, if you put the virtual console with, like, thousands of items on there... I believe what happened is that the story was slightly altered later or whatever.
365811	371294	There was some clarification that came out that said that this is only in regards to new stuff.
371474	376816	This does not address the way that they're going to price the old Nintendo Entertainment System games, the Super Nintendo games.
377177	380018	This is only about new things developed for the virtual console.
380058	381279	That's the price range they're looking at.
381439	382799	I'm telling you, dude, if they do 99 cents per game...
384580	385761	That's gonna be one sweet deal
406437	407619	We'll see, I suppose.
407639	415148	Or like as an added incentive to say maybe Super Mario Galaxy bundle in the retro Mario games with that too.
416169	417551	Mario, Super Mario Brothers 2, um,
419932	420632	and so on and so forth.
447523	450544	DS software can be expanded using the Wii.
451645	455326	The DS can access DS station services via the Wii.
455706	462629	So we were kind of thinking that that might be one feature that you could download DS demos using your Wii, and I think that's a kick-butt idea.
462689	463509	It's very smart.
464109	469131	Oh, Nintendo's got some really interesting stuff in store, so we'll just have to see how it all works.
470051	471612	Because sometimes things look good on paper.
472628	473369	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
497591	497951	systems.
498171	498651	Exactly.
498711	513775	I mean, at least the stuff that they had, I mean, granted, it may not have been the best stuff for the system, but it was still pretty cool to play some NES games on the Game Boy Advance when you had Animal Crossing or, you know, using it in Crystal Chronicles, stuff like that.
516036	524138	One thing that they are mentioning, though, is that the release date is going to be announced before September.
525595	525815	Huh.
526235	528376	So, um, that's interesting.
528816	529876	So we'll have to wait and see.
530176	531316	I wonder why they're waiting so long.
531776	541638	Maybe they, maybe they still, I'm starting to theorize, maybe, even though we've had all this speculation that we think October 18th's the date and everything, maybe Nintendo really still doesn't know what date they're gonna do.
541858	546039	Maybe they're waiting until they're absolutely certain they can hit it, and then they'll reveal it.
546359	546779	I don't know.
547219	549160	I'm just starting to wildly speculate here.
549720	549940	But...
550945	553966	Maybe they feel they don't need this three-month hype going into it.
554006	555846	They already have the hype coming off E3.
556546	558687	They don't really need to announce, oh, it's coming out.
558907	560887	They could do it six weeks in advance and still get away with it.
561608	562048	So who knows?
562328	566629	Because let's say they announce the date in early September and the October 18th date turns out to be true.
566969	568089	That would only be like six weeks.
568889	569630	But that's enough time.
571350	571930	They can do it.
572410	572970	Very interesting.
574011	574311	Let's see.
574471	574791	Also...
576092	579335	Nintendo has lots in store for the DS for the rest of the year.
580055	585740	DS, by the way, has shipped 8.43 million units in Japan in just 18 months.
586260	587381	That's pretty interesting.
588181	594366	Let's see, on July 20th, the company's going to release Shabiru DS o Ryori Navi.
594707	596708	It's a cooking program for the DS.
597188	602993	And then on October, the company's going to release Nihon... I'm going to butcher these names so bad, I apologize.
603634	604874	Oh my gosh, that's a huge name.
604955	605435	Basically...
606482	606742	Look at that.
606762	607683	You want to read that whole thing?
609445	610066	I can't see.
610086	610246	Okay.
610266	610606	Let me see.
610646	610987	Oh, there's more?
611587	613169	Okay.
613189	615131	Training DS.
629523	632246	Basically, that is just common knowledge.
632987	635730	It's a brain training game called Common Knowledge.
636511	640857	They plan on releasing three to four Touch Generation Series titles per year.
641217	647284	And of course, those are the games that are designed, like the brain training games and things that are really designed for the adult audience as well as kids.
648976	660724	They're saying hardcore gamers will not be left out, but there was no mention of really any new games, but Iwata did mention that Final Fantasy 3 and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are on their way.
660844	665787	Final Fantasy 3 is set for an August 24th release, but again, that's Japan, but I imagine the U.S.
665827	666607	won't be far behind.
666688	667768	Speaking of Pokemon, Loki.
668128	673532	Yes, Pokemon Battle Revolution, and I'm not a huge Pokemon fan, but
674022	679324	What's interesting about this is the fact that the graphics look a lot better than what we saw at E3 on the Wii.
680144	682064	And that I thought was quite interesting.
682624	697549	The game actually, though, looks like it's going to tie in with the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of the new Pokemon games, as well as it's supposed to use the DS as a microphone for the game as well.
698229	701010	What looks interesting, though, they actually have video up from it.
702287	704911	It looks like Final Fantasy X battles.
705252	708537	I mean, basically, just really hardcore battles.
708677	715989	And the graphics look pretty good, and I'm not sure if you've seen the picture yet, but, I mean, that looks pretty damn good for a
716794	717755	Thank you for watching!
734687	735808	And this game is supposed to launch in 2006.
735868	736428	Wow.
736908	739008	Well, that's kind of early then.
739789	742009	Maybe the Wii is capable of even more and more and more.
742069	742470	We'll see.
742750	743130	I think so.
743670	744010	All right.
744050	749532	Well, one interesting game that may be on its way out soon, DarkSakura, you have some news on this.
749872	759095	It's a Zelda spin-off for the DS called Mogitate Tinglebara Irui Rupeeland, which translates to Fresh Tingles Rose-Colored Rupeeland.
759435	760195	Fresh Tingles.
761356	771623	Tingle was in Wind Waker and Majora's Mask and also I might mention that Tingle actually really translates over to Tinkle they just changed it because that would be really bad
773248	781652	Anyway, you are basically carted around by this person named Rupe... I guess it's Rupeji.
781692	782932	It was supposed to be Old Man Rupe.
782952	787154	It basically tells you to... Maybe Rupeji, I guess.
787434	789255	It's written like it'd be Rupeji, but anyway.
791656	798119	You have to basically collect rupees and throw them in a magic spring so you go to Rupeeland and you turn into Tingle.
799076	805638	So you also get help from a fairy named Pingle who talks to you by a TV in your house.
806458	810299	And you have to pay people and keep them happy and go through toll gates.
810959	811959	Tingle and Pingle.
811999	813620	This sounds like Teletubby's The Game.
814780	820121	Also another title that's coming up for DS is Kaito Wario 7.
820341	820641	Guess what?
820661	821062	WarioWare.
821902	822202	Oh, cool.
822562	822682	Yep.
824586	829750	by the studio that brought us F-Zero Climax on the GBA and Rhythmic Star on Itoy.
829970	831031	F-Zero Climax.
832452	833693	Yeah, F-Zero will make you.
833733	834273	I'm going to win.
834313	834894	I'm going to win.
835594	835735	Oh.
836675	836976	All right.
837296	838217	Moving on.
838697	841699	Loki, let's get into some political-oriented news.
841819	842100	Loki?
842800	843121	Yes.
843581	853589	Hillary Clinton opened her big fat mouth, and she basically said that the federal government needs to step in to ensure that electronic media, including video games, isn't harming children's development.
854441	869807	and what she's basically suggesting is that they approve a federal funded research program into the effects or broad effects of media from everything from television to video games to the internet on children.
871367	881871	What she needs to research is a way that parents do their fucking job and she also needs a researcher goddamn new platform to be, you know, bitching about.
882821	883342	I don't like it.
893888	894768	Very interesting quote there.
894788	896189	Parents do not need goddamn help.
896229	898989	Hold on, I want to point this out too.
899289	905891	This statement, by the way, came just like hours before the House of Representatives made that indecency fine increase.
905911	906311	$32,500 up to $325,000.
906411	907511	That was a 379 to 35 vote in the House.
907531	907991	You know what?
908011	910812	It's not the place of our government to be sticking their nose into how parents do their job.
910872	911672	Parents need to actually...
924039	925339	Be the ones to do their job.
925399	927920	And if you're not ready to do that job, don't have the children.
927980	929881	We mean they don't understand how to do their job.
929901	939583	There's a goddamn reading system that tells them what is appropriate for what age, what kind of content is in said product, and there's also parental controls on your console systems.
940003	944204	I mean, how much more do I need to go over there and wipe their ass for them too?
944244	949405	Because it's apparently, oh, I'm so helpless, I can't possibly monitor what my kid sees.
949806	951566	You know, there's reading systems and everything.
952518	953298	This has been done.
953358	955359	It's just the parents are too goddamn lazy to do this.
955439	958861	And then when something bad happens, Oh my god, I didn't know!
959261	960102	I didn't know!
960562	962283	I'm gonna sue for lots of money now!
962443	964424	So, you know, that's basically what it comes down to.
965764	969266	The parents are retarded, and then they get paid for being retarded.
970207	971507	Thank you, America!
971787	973168	Rewarding the retarded!
973188	974469	Alright, alright.
974509	976370	Speaking of people not... This just keeps going.
976390	978491	Speaking of people not doing their jobs...
980047	984750	Um, guess what, uh, one of the, uh, judges in the John A. Gotti Jr.
985030	985731	trial was doing.
986251	988733	Well, I already know the answer, but I'll act surprised.
989853	992415	Uh, basically, uh, he was playing solitaire.
994136	994216	Wow.
994236	994696	In the trial.
995137	995777	Wasn't it a she?
996838	998979	Yes, it was, uh, I'm trying to find the name.
999519	1001200	Shira, uh, Scheindlin.
1001601	1001881	Wow.
1002081	1005563	Who was, uh, playing, uh, solitaire during the trial.
1005983	1006223	Wow.
1006484	1008585	Um, basically, while, um...
1011755	1013816	I'm trying to see who the name was.
1014257	1023743	I think it was Curtis Stilwell, one of the Guardian Angels from one of the anti-crime groups, basically, was testifying and the judge was playing solitaire.
1024764	1025144	Wow.
1025464	1026005	And I never...
1027032	1033696	Until I had jury duty, I always thought the judge just kind of sat there and just kind of watched everything going on.
1033976	1037378	But the judge really is doing other stuff while people are there testifying.
1037478	1045642	When one of the lawyers yells objection, that's when the judge kind of looks over and will look at the last few things said and then make a ruling.
1045682	1050565	Otherwise, the judge, I don't know if he's doing emails or looking up law things on the internet or maybe playing solitaire.
1050585	1050885	I don't know.
1050925	1051465	I doubt he is.
1051505	1052506	He seems like a really smart guy.
1052646	1053706	Poor no.
1053726	1054547	It's interesting.
1055187	1058349	It's interesting what the judges could possibly get away with.
1059530	1063272	If I hadn't done jury duty this week, I would have never imagined that this could be humanly possible.
1063292	1067295	There's an interesting quote here from Scylla, basically comparing...
1068562	1073165	The New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg firing a city worker for playing solitaire at the desk.
1073706	1080690	To quote, Should a federal judge be playing video solitaire when an employee of the New York City government gets fired for playing video solitaire?
1081151	1083532	I don't think any of us are that good at multitasking.
1083612	1085053	To me, it's an abuse and an outrage.
1086594	1091058	Honestly, you know, there's a type... I'm going to point out something.
1091238	1092178	Not everyone is aware of this.
1092639	1095941	There is a type of learning called kinesthetic learning.
1097114	1101936	What this means is that you learn better while you were doing other things, when you have something else pulling your attention.
1103217	1113222	Actually, we did this at work, we did a study on this at work, where we were given toys, like Legos and stuff, to do while we were at one of our training classes.
1114002	1117644	And at least half of the class actually retained the knowledge in our training class better.
1118360	1140460	So, you know, a lot of times when, you know, I have to listen to something, I'm doodling, I doodle in class, you know, people, some people learn, or actually I would say pay attention better when they've got something else going on, something that is, you know, when they keep one, I guess, one of their senses occupied, be it, you know, in playing solitaire.
1141104	1143046	That, you know, they'll be able to better listen.
1143086	1144548	I mean, there are people that are just like that.
1144888	1152175	And on top of that, you know, I would rather have a judge that's good at multitasking than having someone that can only focus on one thing at one time.
1152556	1159823	And on top of that, it's also proven that people who play video games are better, have a better understanding for complex situations.
1160083	1161965	It almost sounds like you're okay with her playing solitaire.
1161985	1162666	Yeah, I am okay with it.
1163026	1163267	Really?
1163287	1163507	It's funny.
1164288	1164468	Huh.
1164488	1164548	Huh.
1164875	1165895	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1185091	1186031	It's just cards.
1186471	1191232	And the fact that you have a game on a computer with cards, that's solitaire as retarded.
1191532	1193113	Solitaire is so last century.
1193933	1195693	I have to read the comments in our chat room.
1195753	1197493	OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
1198193	1201214	SSJ100Matt says, they should be playing Phoenix Wright.
1201974	1203234	Of course, making the obvious joke there.
1203955	1206775	Blaze says, the judge does not watch porn, Loki.
1206855	1211336	Judges are heavily involved and can actually swing a trial for or against the prosecution defense.
1214853	1216674	Anyway, moving right along.
1216774	1219315	Loki, you have some more political-oriented news.
1219455	1221116	Yeah, as if this is a big surprise.
1221296	1222657	ESA is going to sue Minnesota.
1222837	1223758	And why are they suing them?
1223798	1232442	Of course, because of the recent law that they passed that would fine kids $25 for buying or renting M or adult-rated games.
1233242	1236604	And basically, they said that,
1236926	1242289	This is definitely costing taxpayers a lot of money for a law that they can't really enforce in the first place.
1243409	1257816	And they said, and I quote, The bill's tortured effort to end the run of the First Amendment by punishing kids directly fails under the Constitution because children have rights under the First Amendment like all other citizens.
1258317	1264840	The state is attempting to impose liability on children because they know that the courts have constantly held
1267667	1272611	We believe that the courts will agree that fighting children violates the First Amendment as well.
1273872	1284381	And if this law is implemented, it will not only limit the First Amendment rights for Minnesota residents, it will create a huge amount of confusion for retailers, parents, and children.
1284441	1284982	I'm confident...
1285748	1291550	That the court will affirm our position given the ruling on similar statutes in other jurisdictions.
1291930	1295892	And here's my problem with the whole thing is why the hell did this law get passed in the first place?
1295912	1300213	They don't have similar laws for R-rated movies or NC-17 movies.
1301094	1302834	It's fine for kids to see that stuff.
1302934	1304575	And that's more lifelike than games.
1305035	1306476	So what the hell?
1306516	1307696	This is stupid.
1308016	1311017	It's really stupid and it will probably get overturned anyway.
1311137	1312438	So whatever.
1314966	1328040	Moving on to another state and their political news, Louisiana, the Senate has unanimously passed a bill that had a lot of involvement by he who shall not be named on this program anymore, the Media Horn.
1328060	1333226	If you don't know who we're talking about, his name rhymes with Mr. Fuck-Ompson.
1335528	1335969	Jackass.
1336274	1339237	The Measure was written by Representative Roy Burrell.
1355653	1356934	and he was just a co-author on it.
1356974	1364377	It's HB 1381 and it makes it illegal to sell, rent, or lease a game to a minor if it meets three conditions.
1364938	1376043	If the average person would think appeals to the minor's morbid interest in violence or if it depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to prevailing standards
1376604	1383434	and the game also qualifies if it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.
1384135	1388842	Violators could be fined between $102,000 and sentenced up to 12 months in a state prison.
1389243	1390164	What a bunch of horse shit.
1390344	1390605	I mean...
1391582	1392983	Where's the checks here?
1393383	1396866	I hate these vague, vague laws that people are coming up with.
1396966	1405652	Who determines if a game lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors?
1405692	1410336	It's not the government's job to rate art.
1411236	1418782	That same description there, it actually does go into a free speech right, because that actually is one of the defining rights for what allows free speech and what doesn't.
1419912	1432885	They're basically trying to manipulate the Constitution into applying it toward video games instead of saying, oh, well, you're denying us our free speech right, trying to make it fall under what's allowable free speech.
1433566	1434306	It's the same thing.
1434426	1435327	Let me look up the First Amendment.
1438350	1442915	No, actually, I want to hear this First Amendment passage here.
1444315	1445175	I'll read some more here.
1460320	1469163	Governor of Louisiana, and of course the governor is expected to sign the bill because of the unanimous vote and the recent linking of games and teenage murder suspects in the Louisiana media.
1469723	1475245	And of course you can expect that the ESA will have a problem with this and file a lawsuit immediately.
1476466	1476826	Any luck?
1478526	1485569	Well, I'm trying to find it because basically it's a matter of court interpretation because we went over this in my law class, some of my law classes that I've taken.
1488428	1494631	I mean, basically, just looking through this, we've been dealing with this since the country was created.
1495631	1500593	Looking on here, there's also a note on here that basically...
1501937	1507459	They can punish words that by their very nature invoke danger to the public peace and to the security of the state.
1507499	1510080	That's one of the things listed.
1510640	1513161	Here it is on Wikipedia.
1513221	1514822	Here's the exact text right here.
1515482	1531208	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
1535785	1542591	I'm trying to, there was, there were a number of cases though where they brought that in under, here it is, obscenity.
1545918	1547079	I'm quoting Wikipedia, basically.
1547119	1550921	The federal government and the states have long permitted to restrict obscene and pornographic speech.
1551342	1556505	While obscene speech generally has no protection under the First Amendment, pornography is subject to little regulation.
1556965	1560488	The exact definition of obscenity in pornography has changed over time.
1561408	1565291	I really recommend that people go on Wikipedia and read this.
1565311	1566312	There's a lot of stuff here.
1567172	1595608	but um they're basically saying in Miller vs. California 1973 a work is obscene if it and this is basically what's referred to as the Miller test which is where the basis of that law in Louisiana a work is obscene if it would be found appealing to the prurient interest by an average person applying contemporary community standards to pick sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and has no serious literary artistic and political or scientific value so basically they're taking
1596684	1599571	What they've applied to movies and applying it to video games.
1600120	1602142	Let's take this even a step further than that.
1602482	1604523	Let's punish people for not sharing.
1604924	1612689	Because basically, right here, you're taking the parents' responsibility for deciding what their kids can see.
1613290	1621736	Let's go ahead and have the government step in for their other jobs, like making sure that the kids share their toys with their brothers and sisters.
1621776	1624758	And I think we should find the kids that do not share their toys.
1625039	1626540	And we should also basically...
1627200	1628521	and Penny Arcade as we mentioned before.
1649760	1652322	is working on ads for the ESRB.
1652362	1658086	And some of these were actually kind of shown a little bit at E3, and they've actually unveiled a couple of them so far.
1658407	1659167	And they look pretty good.
1659207	1661969	They've just got a character with text written around the outside.
1662170	1669355	And, for example, I'm going to pull up one here for Sarah, one of the ones advertising the E rating.
1669715	1676140	It says, because Sarah plays video games, there is a group of people making sure that the games she plays are rated.
1676613	1679834	They're called the Entertainment Software Ratings Board.
1680394	1682855	But that's just the long way of saying it.
1683775	1686316	Usually it's called the ESRB.
1687076	1695618	They check games to help make sure... It's hard to read this.
1695638	1697639	It's hard to read because it goes around the corner.
1697739	1698159	I don't know.
1698519	1699519	That might be something in the app.
1699539	1703841	To make sure it's right for you, your older brother, mom and dad, anybody.
1704281	1705321	Somebody's got to do it.
1705825	1707126	and they're the ones that do.
1709328	1711909	So it's basically an ad saying, you know what, this is being done.
1712190	1714031	And the same thing is being done with film.
1714451	1717313	I don't understand, okay, they've done it in the past.
1717353	1721156	They've, you know, gone after movies and stuff.
1721516	1723858	But still though, it's the same thing.
1723898	1724378	It's media.
1724398	1727160	Just because it's interactive, big deal.
1727401	1732044	You know, big deal if it's interactive, but it doesn't, it's still the same thing.
1732204	1734826	I mean, I can go watch, you know, a kung fu movie and when I
1735453	1737074	Kick the crap out of people afterwards.
1737154	1738374	It's the same damn thing.
1738995	1741856	So I don't know why they're not attacking all media at the same time.
1742456	1742856	All right.
1743317	1744297	Moving on.
1744457	1747839	Speaking of promotion, the ESRB trying to promote their rating system there.
1747879	1750980	We like to promote good websites on this program, don't we, DarkSakura?
1751240	1751680	Sure do.
1752000	1754421	And DarkSakura is the queen of the Internet.
1754441	1760604	She surfs the Internet up and down and finds a website that she would like to share with you guys in her website of the week.
1760624	1762505	So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be going this week?
1765345	1772313	Well, I talked about them last week because I'd had a really good experience actually doing business with the business side of the site.
1772694	1775457	But I wanted to actually promote the forums at Junkiespot.com.
1776017	1778941	It's J-U-N-K-Y spot dot com.
1779802	1786069	For anyone who's basically getting into, like I've been getting into the Dolphies, the model doll where you customize everything.
1786744	1791828	I swear I found more information on their forums than I have anywhere else in the entirety of the internet.
1792768	1796531	On top of that, it's a good place for communication for anybody who's into that.
1797592	1799873	I've had nothing but a good experience there.
1800013	1800774	Everyone's friendly.
1800834	1806618	It's like I haven't even seen... It's the only forum I've ever been to that I haven't seen any flaming at all on.
1806678	1808780	Is there going to be anything for me if I'm not into dollies?
1809460	1809600	No.
1810001	1810181	No.
1810581	1813143	But I've talked to a few of our listeners who have gotten into it.
1813763	1814023	Alright.
1814224	1816125	So I figured, you know, this is my...
1816843	1818324	Casting my side of the week is my side of the week.
1818584	1819064	That's fine.
1821806	1826088	But also, though, there are actually some good painting tips, though.
1826368	1830971	I mean, a lot of these, my husband was saying, yeah, that applies to model cars, too.
1831191	1831891	Okay, fair enough.
1833052	1834773	So I'm being girly, okay?
1834953	1840336	Well, if you like to dress up your models in Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, maybe you want to dress up a dolly.
1840996	1842477	There's people who have made...
1843820	1850747	who have done basically cosplay Dolphies where they've actually made characters from different games.
1851308	1851568	Wow.
1852329	1852950	I think it's pretty cool.
1853610	1854831	Now that could be interesting.
1854912	1857354	Dolls based off of the characters.
1857374	1859857	People would make those and sell them for tons of money at conventions.
1859877	1861999	You can actually buy, though, pre-done...
1863114	1890332	they're made by different companies but like they've actually started releasing I think they're the the cool girls line I'm trying to remember I think it's Takara that puts it out they have a cutie honey and they have Kusanagi whatever her name is from Ghost in the Shell they have a doll for that and a lot of different places but it's kind of a weird little niche thing it's a hobby I picked up while I was you know out of work but it's
1891109	1892570	This is a good informative place.
1893631	1893931	Alright.
1894852	1899035	Going back into some gaming news, Loki, some news in the Street Fighter world?
1899215	1901076	Yes, and it's interesting.
1901436	1913044	Kind of a rumor at the point right now, but it says according to a website, snk-capcom.com, a DC vs. Street Fighter game may be indeed in the works.
1913705	1920890	And they've confirmed with both parties at this year's E3 that the legalities of the game were being considered
1921648	1947002	and um it'd be pretty interesting if they came out with that now you might remember they used to do like a Marvel versus Capcom and Marvel versus Street Fighter so DC versus Street Fighter would be kind of cool although I think Superman would kick everyone's ass in that so I don't know be interesting to see Superman versus like uh Chung Li I think he's gonna beat her ass we'll see just a little bit there she might have kryptonite panties on you never know oh okay all right uh
1947816	1949197	Now, this is very interesting.
1949237	1958263	If you're a Final Fantasy fan, certainly you're anticipating Final Fantasy XIII, and this is why the PlayStation 3 is still cool for some people, because Final Fantasy XIII looks to be pretty ass-kicking.
1958643	1962506	And Advent Children actually is inspiring Final Fantasy XIII somewhat.
1963026	1973213	Not maybe directly, but, you know, while the DVD kind of got some mixed reviews from people, it had some great kick-butt battle sequences in the movie, like some really fast-paced things.
1973233	1974834	I mean, you guys have probably seen this in the trailer.
1975214	1986277	Well, this is interesting because Final Fantasy XIII's director, Motomo Toriyama said, Final Fantasy XIII attempts to see how far it's possible to make Final Fantasy VII Advent Children's battles into a game.
1986678	1992519	Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is a video production, and it showed us battles that have not been achievable in Final Fantasy so far.
1992899	1997241	With Final Fantasy XIII, we're focusing on how far we can realize the video.
1997921	1999922	So that might be a pretty sweet game.
1999962	2002503	Imagine you're getting to control some of those battle sequences.
2002603	2005144	That'll sell some PlayStation 3s.
2005744	2007405	That'll get the Sony family back.
2007425	2008885	That game ain't coming out until next year.
2009566	2010786	Way late next year.
2010946	2011587	If even that.
2011627	2012647	And that'll be in Japan.
2012887	2015268	I mean, how long did Final Fantasy XII take to come out?
2015308	2015908	Oh my gosh.
2016068	2017009	And it's still not out here.
2017049	2017529	Exactly.
2018009	2019950	I would say, I don't even think we're going to get it next year.
2019990	2022831	I would say we will have Final Fantasy XIII Christmas 2008.
2023531	2025492	I would anticipate.
2025592	2026653	But what do I know?
2026693	2027693	I'm just some guy on the internet.
2029651	2031953	Loki, you have some news regarding online games.
2032093	2034315	Yeah, actually, the online game market is huge.
2034576	2035156	How huge?
2035476	2039300	They're estimating it's going to reach $13 billion by the year 2011.
2041081	2049429	And, of course, this is a lot in part for games such as World of Warcraft and EverQuest and whatnot.
2049749	2053833	But just basically, even nowadays, you see tons of MMOs coming around.
2054905	2057026	That's just the way everything's kind of headed nowadays.
2057046	2063231	And even like Xbox Live Arcade and a lot of the online games, everything's really just heading online.
2063331	2066213	So it's no wonder that it's going to be that big.
2067114	2070197	And I wouldn't be surprised if it hits $13 billion even sooner than that.
2070877	2073859	That's kind of being safe.
2076562	2079984	When it comes to big, it doesn't get much bigger than World of Warcraft.
2080224	2083267	And you know there was a story we talked about on this program, probably like
2084056	2084556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2108390	2121699	and basically the companies agreed to withdraw their previous takedown notices and drop all the infringement claims and also it was said that they'd refrain from filing any future takedown notices against the same items COP has already disputed through counter notices.
2122599	2132225	And COP, by the way, will be retaining the book's disclaimers about its unofficial nature and he won't include links or instructions on how to locate cheats in the game.
2132646	2135267	So it's strictly a strategy guide without endorsing cheating.
2135307	2136028	So a little bit of
2136508	2137368	www.orangeloungeradio.com
2152946	2154608	or you can give us a phone call as well.
2154688	2166737	The phone number is 916-226-9067 but please keep in mind that that is a toll call for most people so please if you don't own the phone line or pay the bills, please ask somebody before you give us a call.
2167577	2170479	And we already have a phone call coming in so I'm going to go ahead and pick that up.
2171660	2172981	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2173762	2175983	Hi, Sky, it's me, Raven's Dolphin.
2176023	2177745	Hello, Raven's Dolphin, what's on your mind?
2178826	2180567	I just picked up the DS Lite.
2181088	2182609	Ah, yes, the DS Lites are out today.
2182649	2183309	What do you think?
2184370	2184970	I love it.
2185350	2186031	Yeah?
2186091	2186991	What's so great about it?
2187612	2189633	I don't know if I'm totally sold on the DS Lite yet.
2190094	2194276	Tell me why I need to get this when I already have the DS, you know, fat.
2195077	2195437	All right.
2196158	2196438	All right.
2196558	2197579	Just for one reason.
2198099	2200180	This thing has brighter screens.
2201401	2208526	I'm not saying this just because when I turned this thing on, I noticed a big difference from the original.
2211067	2214448	There's colors I haven't seen before.
2233234	2234155	It sure is.
2234615	2235676	I don't know what else to call it.
2235736	2237157	There's the DS... DS Heavy.
2237518	2238739	I like the DS Fat.
2238939	2239659	The DS Fatty.
2240800	2241401	I like Crappy.
2242622	2243482	It's not crappy.
2243663	2244804	DS is a good system.
2245184	2246145	It's just a little fat.
2246825	2247946	I like the light better.
2248286	2248607	All right.
2249908	2250308	What about now?
2250328	2252610	Here's somebody in our chat room here.
2252890	2255873	VXJSNXV says, Brider is totally unnecessary.
2256793	2257434	What do you say to that?
2258581	2259342	I don't say much.
2259843	2262026	Ari Mawson says, I got my DS Lite today.
2262086	2263809	I love its death brightness setting.
2264149	2265672	The red is more redder now.
2266633	2268456	Yeah, I like fourth is death.
2268716	2269217	And you know what?
2270118	2270879	Oh, can I say something?
2271020	2271180	Yeah.
2272483	2275105	Alright, I stand in line for three minutes for a DS Lite.
2275285	2277506	No one was at my ebb store.
2277886	2278286	EB.
2278747	2281828	Well, there hasn't been a whole lot of promotion leading up to launch day.
2282148	2285830	I think it's something Nintendo just kind of wants out there and is going to be circulating.
2285871	2290073	I don't think there was really a huge push for a stellar launch for this.
2291119	2296760	Yeah, but in Japan, people have been waiting in line for days to get a DS.
2296780	2298641	Well, that's because everybody else has imported one.
2298721	2302521	They stand in line for Dragon Quest, too, yet here nobody cares, although they should.
2304082	2307443	Yeah, but they at least Dragon Quest on a Sunday or a Saturday.
2308243	2308703	All right.
2309363	2311243	All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
2314744	2315524	Don't support Sony.
2316224	2317465	Well, we'll see.
2318045	2318585	You know what?
2319720	2320620	Things can change.
2321281	2326923	I realize the world is anti-Sony right now, but devil's advocate, you guys, Sony might say something that's going to win you back.
2328143	2328783	All right, we'll see.
2329363	2330484	All right, Raven's Dolphin, have a good one.
2331144	2331624	You too, bye.
2331804	2332604	All right, see you later.
2332804	2333345	Thanks for the call.
2333745	2335105	Let's go to another phone call.
2335205	2336706	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2336746	2337126	Who's this?
2339538	2340158	Hi, who's this?
2344161	2346583	Hi, you're sounding a little distorted there.
2346643	2348765	Maybe pull the microphone back just a little bit.
2348805	2349445	What's on your mind?
2350046	2350746	Sorry about that.
2350826	2351267	That's all right.
2352347	2356911	Well, I'm going to go on a rant, if you don't mind.
2357191	2357732	You're going to what?
2358512	2359373	Go on a rant.
2359573	2361555	Okay, go ahead and rant for a little bit.
2362055	2365998	Put the microphone a little bit closer, but not as close as it was before, and then rant.
2367168	2369329	Okay, I hate Final Fantasy.
2369830	2370250	Why?
2371891	2379636	I have played it, I do not like it, I respect people who like it, but I do not like it.
2379796	2380997	Wait, which one or all of them?
2382298	2388202	Um, I have played all the big ones, Final Fantasy 7, 10, all those, and I do not like it.
2388582	2389843	So you haven't played any of the classics?
2390168	2393349	I just find it boring and a little just kind of weird and not too original.
2408553	2409634	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2427089	2435555	and, you know, I realize why sports games are out there, and there's some pretty good sports games out there if you're into those types of games, but for me, I don't really play sports games.
2435595	2436236	I don't enjoy them.
2436536	2438898	So that's just kind of the type of game I'm not into.
2439298	2445802	So I'm cool with you not liking Final Fantasy as long as, you know, you still have respect for people that are into it, because I respect people that play sports titles.
2446843	2453728	And also, and I thank you for respecting it, but I've had many people say, you suck, you suck!
2454148	2454549	Well, just...
2456926	2460048	You know, instead of this, okay, instead of this, try a different approach.
2460228	2466112	Instead, next time, knock it on Final Fantasy, tell your friends about the games you do like and make them play those games.
2467013	2467273	Okay.
2467353	2468353	Less hate, more love.
2468533	2468814	Get it?
2469534	2474958	And also, as you may have noticed, I tried it before I judged.
2475218	2476098	All right, well, that's good.
2476659	2477359	That I can respect.
2477379	2481062	I'm like one Mac hater that I will not mention.
2481642	2482442	All right, all right.
2483203	2484304	We're going to let you go, buddy.
2484324	2486265	We got more calls coming in, but thanks for the call, okay?
2487623	2488043	All right, later.
2490165	2492146	All right, let's take another call here.
2492686	2493987	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2494007	2494427	Who's this?
2495928	2498150	Hi, this is the AmpliDude.
2498910	2499130	Hello.
2500131	2500851	Hi, AmpliDude.
2500871	2501532	What's on your mind?
2502712	2503313	Just calling in.
2503573	2506455	I didn't get to listen to much of the show besides the past 10 minutes.
2506515	2510797	But as the last caller, Final Fantasy...
2512153	2513394	Final Fantasy V is more of a good thing.
2540435	2540815	Amplitude Amplitude
2571342	2573024	Pretty much all RPGs.
2573084	2575546	I was just playing Beatmania not too long ago before I called.
2576166	2577327	US one or Japanese one?
2578788	2579649	7th Japanese.
2579929	2581870	Okay, that's one of the styles I don't own.
2582531	2584332	Because I took a break from Beatmania for a little while.
2584352	2584933	I skipped that one.
2585673	2586154	No, I didn't.
2586234	2587014	I have 7th style.
2587234	2588435	7th has some of my favorite music in it.
2588475	2589276	No, I have 7th style.
2589356	2590477	I didn't get 9th and up.
2590537	2592518	I might need to borrow some of those from you at some point.
2592739	2593499	Because I miss a whole bunch.
2593519	2594740	If I ever get mine back from George.
2595321	2595581	I see.
2595601	2595901	Okay.
2597194	2597675	That's cool.
2597955	2598655	B-Media is a good time.
2598675	2599555	Have you played Red yet?
2600216	2600916	Oh, yeah.
2601176	2606778	I actually left it at home, so I had to deal with 7, but 11 is awesome.
2607198	2608459	It's a beautiful setup.
2608519	2609379	I need to play more of it.
2609579	2610200	I absolutely do.
2611080	2612661	Any other thoughts for our listeners, Amplitude?
2614121	2618003	Well, my friend's girlfriend brought over her DS Lite today.
2618083	2619923	It's pretty kick-ass, I have to say.
2620904	2622184	Are the Reds indeed redder?
2623285	2623365	Um...
2624349	2625170	It's a lot brighter.
2626851	2630153	It feels a lot different than I would have expected.
2630493	2632614	Like, I expected it to feel a lot different than it did.
2632835	2635736	But is it worth $129?
2636077	2638698	Is it worth that much money?
2639799	2645223	Well, since I've had mine since it came out, it kind of turned shitty, so I need to get myself a new one.
2645983	2646563	Well, I don't know.
2646603	2647604	I'm still on the fence with it.
2647664	2649886	Maybe if I have extra money after my vacation coming up.
2649906	2650226	We'll see.
2651721	2654842	Alright, Amplitude, thanks so much for the call, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, okay?
2655602	2656042	Alright, cool.
2656083	2656643	Have a good one, buddy.
2656663	2657643	You too.
2657803	2658123	Bye-bye.
2659564	2661905	Let's go to at least one more call, maybe two.
2662905	2663445	Let's go to this one.
2663485	2664846	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2665666	2666106	Hello.
2666326	2666946	Hi, who's this?
2667827	2669167	Uh, Nintendo Maniac 64.
2669327	2670988	Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.
2671048	2671808	What's on your mind, buddy?
2672608	2676490	Uh, first off, uh, what is his name, like, Gizem or Gizem or something.
2676770	2678310	He really wanted me to call in.
2679451	2680711	Okay, what do you want to call in about?
2681807	2684308	Um, first off, you can say about the DS Lite and stuff.
2684628	2691351	Well, you know, I was up in New York and stuff, and at Nintendo World, I actually saw them installing the DS Lite demo stations, which was kind of cool.
2693292	2693772	That's cool.
2694073	2695893	What was the Nintendo store like?
2695913	2696774	You went there for the launch?
2697854	2701856	Uh, no, I was just up there in New York for this art show my sister was in.
2702776	2704377	It was for, like, Scholastics and stuff.
2704777	2708379	That's right, because didn't you put out the call in the last episode of the show you wanted to meet fans or something?
2708999	2710580	Yeah, um, nobody came, so, like,
2711209	2712430	There's my SU for the week.
2712530	2714470	I'll come next time, if I have money.
2717132	2719513	So did you get to actually play the DS Lite when you were there?
2719533	2727656	Yeah, I did, but, like, I mean, sure, it was brighter and stuff, but, okay, whoop-de-doo.
2727836	2729157	It wasn't that great to me.
2729937	2731498	Ah, so a little bit of a diss.
2731578	2732718	The red's not so red.
2733599	2734519	Well, it's real red.
2734579	2740762	I mean, like, I just didn't care too much, and I got to phone some people at DDR Mario Mix,
2741266	2745828	I haven't played Mario Mix since E3 last year, so... But I don't want to void my warranty!
2745848	2747189	Some of our warranties are already passed.
2768340	2769200	Alright, fair enough.
2769240	2771781	Yes, we have talked about that hack on previous episodes of the show.
2771801	2773202	And just one last question.
2773262	2773482	Yes.
2773582	2775743	For any DS lighters out there who have them.
2777104	2784707	Does any guys know if the DS light battery is the exact same shape and stuff as a regular DS battery?
2786247	2787388	Oh, the DS battery stuff.
2788408	2789849	I don't know, because we don't own one.
2789889	2793150	I imagine it's probably the same charger, but I'll let someone in the chat answer that.
2793740	2794761	My old charger's probably the same.
2794781	2798442	Well, I'm saying that, like, you know how, like, battery life is, like, twice as long and stuff?
2798482	2804965	I was just wondering if you could, like, somehow get the battery out of the new one, but in your old DS, what, you get, like, 40 hours or something?
2804985	2805246	Oh, really?
2805266	2805546	Interesting.
2821516	2824137	Alright, we'll see there, and Sakurina's agreeing.
2824617	2826538	We'll see what the chatroom says, and I'll fill you in.
2826578	2826878	Okay.
2827158	2828158	Alright, we're going to let you go, buddy.
2828178	2829599	We'll try and take one more call, alright?
2829999	2832760	Okay, apparently my DSL just dropped out on me for a second.
2833160	2833340	Ouch.
2833600	2835221	Well, you can always download the podcast.
2836401	2837502	No, I mean, it reconnects.
2837562	2838662	It just does a standpoint.
2839102	2839463	Alrighty.
2840783	2841363	Have a good one, buddy.
2841983	2842184	See ya.
2842384	2842504	Bye.
2842524	2842684	Bye.
2844390	2850454	Someone in chat room pointing out there that the battery life is, of course, shorter if you use the four times the brightness there.
2851315	2854117	So the higher the brightness, the shorter the battery life, obviously.
2854217	2855898	Same thing on most laptops, et cetera.
2857239	2858259	Skype line is open.
2858340	2862342	I saw somebody else trying to call in there, but you have a chance now if you want to get in there.
2862422	2865584	Our Skype line's name is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
2865925	2869987	Or you can call us on the regular telephone as well, 916-226-9067.
2870448	2870788	Here we go.
2870888	2871929	One last call for tonight.
2872009	2873450	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2873470	2873830	Who's this?
2874520	2875561	Good evening, OLR.
2875601	2876222	It's DMN.
2876242	2876742	How you doing?
2876802	2877803	Hi, DMN.
2878004	2878764	What's on your mind, buddy?
2880706	2882829	I'd like to give an FU of the week to my own company.
2883670	2884811	Don't you work for Nintendo?
2885191	2885491	I do.
2885892	2886993	Uh-oh, what do they do?
2888575	2893600	It's just a disturbing trend I've been seeing with the DS games since we've been on the subject of the DS Lite.
2894417	2902140	With the games like Brain Training and Nintendogs, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but these games seem to have a shelf life of two weeks, and that's it, and people just toss them away.
2902761	2909863	No, I agree, I regret, I think at E3 last year I said Nintendogs was like the runner-up for Game of Show, I totally regret that.
2910524	2920368	Because it was fun for the hour I played at E3, or not even that, but it was fun for the time I played at E3, but when I actually got it home to play, it was, the thrill lasted a week, maybe two.
2921269	2922590	I traded in my puppies yesterday.
2923491	2929957	It's unfortunate because I've yet to see a DS game that's had a good replay value short of Mario Kart and Tetris.
2931418	2934701	And those are the online games which obviously give those games more replay value.
2934881	2939666	I can't stand Prime Hunters because first person shooters on a portable are just a bad idea.
2940293	2943576	Well, hopefully, and we're echoing really bad, by the way.
2943596	2945477	You might want to back away from your speakers a little bit or turn it down.
2947078	2950401	Hopefully, there will be more online games in Nintendo's future.
2950621	2951242	Many, many more.
2952142	2952763	Oh, definitely.
2954364	2954684	All right.
2956826	2957947	But that's about it.
2958647	2961069	I wanted to rant that, see what people thought.
2962510	2967895	Hopefully, I can get to my inside sources because I'm starting back up at Nintendo.
2967915	2969456	I think we're starting Wii testing tomorrow.
2969927	2972088	So hopefully I can get more info on that for you guys as well.
2972408	2973068	Now, wait a minute.
2973088	2979630	Didn't you say that you were against, like on an earlier show, you were against the October date because the Wiis weren't in yet?
2979650	2983151	Yes, that's what I've been hearing.
2983551	2986712	Ah, so maybe it'll get interesting.
2987412	2988132	Yes, maybe it will.
2988632	2992713	And also Operation Get Reggie Phil's Aim on the show is now underway.
2992893	2993313	Thank you.
2993453	2999035	Please, I would love to make sweet love to Reggie through interview form on this program.
2999884	3001825	I'll be sure to wear protection during that show.
3002065	3002325	I will.
3003646	3005127	Alright, DMN, have a good one, buddy.
3005147	3005927	Thanks for your call.
3006147	3007488	We always appreciate the inside scoop.
3008169	3008749	Alright, bye.
3008809	3009029	Later.
3010530	3011851	Alrighty, good Skyping tonight.
3012531	3012931	Good job.
3014052	3016513	Most of the Skype calls were pretty clear, too.
3016553	3017294	I appreciated that.
3018034	3021736	You guys are calling Echo123 beforehand, like a good Skyper does.
3022256	3023877	Alright, last minute stories, boys and girls.
3023897	3025678	Do we have any last minute stories here in the studio?
3026439	3026719	Anybody?
3026759	3026999	Anybody?
3028763	3029524	No, not me.
3030004	3039054	There was just some stupid thing about... I know we left out a lot from your roll this week, Loki, but there was just too damn much for two hours, and some of it was kind of... I don't know, but was there anything you really wanted to mention?
3040335	3049144	There was some patent filed by Sony about some stupid electronic device that can roll up, almost like electric paper, but not... I don't know.
3049997	3051457	Yeah, but Sony does a lot of electronic things.
3051477	3054799	They're saying that it's going to be used for a game system, and I say no.
3054959	3056279	No, Sony does a lot of electronic things.
3056299	3061421	Well, I heard the Wii filed, or Nintendo had a patent on instant messaging, and my reaction was, duh.
3062181	3066022	You think the Wii's going to have a service kind of like Xbox Lives where you can instant message people?
3066042	3066462	Of course.
3066942	3067363	Of course.
3067383	3067723	Duh.
3068823	3069443	That's not news.
3069463	3071744	That's why I didn't put it in the list for tonight.
3071764	3073605	It's going to be PictoChat for a Wii.
3073645	3074765	Now, that would be rad.
3075677	3076577	PicktoChat on the internet.
3076597	3077718	Yeah, that would be pretty sweet.
3077858	3080539	I would love to draw penises and have them seen worldwide.
3081920	3086141	Well, I was going to say for more of our UK listeners, because I'm a huge fan of football.
3087662	3090003	Wait, is this UK football or US football?
3090023	3090743	Yeah, like soccer.
3090803	3091403	Okay.
3091483	3094204	But Love Football is available on Japanese Xbox Live.
3094264	3095445	You can download the demo.
3095485	3097386	So there's actually a link on...
3099062	3099763	Gamers Report.
3099903	3112443	It's www.gamersreport.com slash news slash 2820 and it'll teach you in case you didn't know how to create an account, a silver membership for under the Japanese territory to download those demos.
3113127	3116850	I might have to do that.
3117030	3121573	Could I do that just by making a new account on my current Xbox?
3121793	3121974	Yeah.
3122234	3122654	I might do that.
3123435	3131100	Also, Oblivion got patched and all the golden duplication glitches, as you would put it, were removed.
3131861	3135603	And also that patch is causing issues, freezes and whatnot.
3136384	3138465	However, there is that undocumented...
3140262	3162238	function that was found in the Spring 360 update to clear your cache and it also removes any updates that have been done on live or any of the games so that you can actually if you accidentally play Oblivion connected to live you can unpatch it so that you can cheat in it again.
3162298	3164400	The way you do that actually is pretty simple.
3165541	3169684	Under the main menu or whatever you would push or actually going under the
3171125	3183472	System, Blade, and then under Memory, you push Y on either the hard drive or the memory unit and push XX, left button, right button, XX.
3183672	3187635	And it'll pop up a little blade saying, do you wish to perform maintenance?
3188055	3190196	If you hit yes, all your updates are gone.
3191777	3198341	But basically a safe way, if you haven't played it and updated it yet, just unhook it from live when you're playing the game.
3198981	3199362	Pretty simple.
3199782	3200022	All right.
3201339	3204741	We're going to go to our final story of the evening, and Loki, it looks like it's yours.
3206202	3206563	Yes.
3209304	3217870	So, anyways, I think we remember back a couple weeks ago, we talked about Codemasters and how they're basically making a game called The Turds.
3217910	3227236	Well, The Turds is actually a series, and they're being made available through a website called Funsta.com.
3227616	3229177	When I think of turd, I don't think of fun.
3229758	3231039	Well, Funsta.com.
3231059	3231899	I think of PlayStation 3.
3232159	3232699	You know what?
3232719	3233320	I think of Taco Bell.
3233600	3237441	You can actually play these games right now, or at least one of them.
3238282	3245825	Some of the wonderful games you get to play would be Donkey Pong, which is going to be obviously turd-based.
3245865	3248346	Now, I've heard of Donkey Bong, but I think that's something different.
3248506	3250767	Or no, I'm sorry, Donkey Punch, I think?
3250907	3252168	No, this is Donkey Pong.
3252248	3252568	Forget it.
3252588	3252788	Poopert.
3252888	3253368	Poopert.
3255758	3260522	Dung Beetle Rally So wait, these guys just take games that we know and love and put poop in them?
3260742	3262503	That's disgusting.
3262783	3269929	Turd Herders, The Men in Crack, and Bogger, which is available now.
3270449	3274372	I equate this with the, what is that, the Crazy Frog thing?
3275433	3278915	That thing that sings the Axel F song?
3278955	3279396	That thing.
3280296	3281837	I equate these turd games with that thing.
3281857	3283659	They have to put that hideous thing in everything.
3284229	3285149	Let me put it this way.
3285189	3288251	Apparently, it's a toy series that's in the UK.
3288831	3289371	Apparently.
3290492	3292073	Why anyone would want to play with poop?
3292233	3302638	But apparently, if you want to play any of these games, go to www.funsta.com That's F-U-N-S-T-A slash turds.
3303238	3307460	And you can actually play Bogger, which I was playing a little bit during some of those Skype line calls.
3308080	3311822	And it just plays like Frogger, but it's sewer and poop based, and it's
3312916	3319819	Stupid, you can download poo tones and wallpapers also from that website, and turd merchandise.
3320499	3323280	And they have a poo calculator to find out how much your turds are worth.
3325821	3329542	This, by the way, will be the only time that Orange Lounge Radio endorses you playing with your poo.
3330283	3332083	But even then, we're looking at you funny.
3333364	3338886	So funsta.com, and you can check out Bogger.
3338946	3340867	The rest of the games are coming out a little bit later.
3342735	3372141	Dung Beetle Rally June 20th Poopert July 4th You can play Donkey Pong and Bogger right now and July 18th Turd Herders Men in Crack And on that note it's time to end the show Let's go around and get everybody's final thought My final thought is I want this sinus infection to go away Loki, your final thought I want this pink guy to go away And DarkSakura, your final thought I want another cookie
3373666	3374587	Reject false icons.
3374607	3375967	Here you go.
3376288	3377208	You said you wanted it.
3378169	3380490	No, that's only my brain telling me that I want one.
3380510	3383932	I'm actually quite satisfied with Swedish ginger cookies.
3384272	3385333	That's going to do it for the show.
