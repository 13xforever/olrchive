WEBVTT

00:23.530 --> 00:27.651
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright kids, we're getting back here for Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.

00:27.691 --> 00:30.292
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the part of the show that's too hot for podcasting.

00:31.372 --> 00:32.453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scandalous stuff.

00:32.793 --> 00:34.273
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this whole room smells like Italian food.

00:34.313 --> 00:34.834
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that out of here.

00:35.394 --> 00:36.854
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than rotting milk.

00:37.054 --> 00:38.855
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop putting that... Nelly?

00:39.035 --> 00:43.436
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it from the... Yeah, from the three McFlurries.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.137
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill your rotten milk cup away.

00:46.977 --> 00:47.297
[SPEAKER_01]: For me?

00:47.738 --> 00:48.378
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I have a breadstick?

00:48.398 --> 00:48.678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

00:50.943 --> 00:53.505
[SPEAKER_01]: Three McFlurries and they're all rotting.

00:53.605 --> 00:54.205
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want a breadstick?

00:54.685 --> 00:55.166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

00:56.287 --> 00:57.207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the breadstick.

01:01.250 --> 01:02.751
[SPEAKER_01]: Food from Olive Garden.

01:04.493 --> 01:04.953
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Nellie.

01:04.973 --> 01:05.714
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very kind of you.

01:05.734 --> 01:06.334
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

01:06.374 --> 01:06.714
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.355
[SPEAKER_07]: I have another bag.

01:07.657 --> 01:09.277
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go to Lion's.

01:09.317 --> 01:09.738
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday!

01:09.758 --> 01:13.899
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get like three bags of bread from Olive Garden?

01:14.119 --> 01:21.141
[SPEAKER_07]: I only have two bags because one of the bags was the leftovers from what was on the table and then I got Matt's dinner to go and that came with four breadsticks.

01:21.681 --> 01:22.021
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

01:22.181 --> 01:23.741
[SPEAKER_01]: It's her birthday today, by the way.

01:23.761 --> 01:24.702
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, Nellie!

01:24.742 --> 01:25.922
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to spank her live on air?

01:26.782 --> 01:27.142
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

01:27.202 --> 01:27.963
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Nellie's bending over.

01:28.003 --> 01:28.343
[SPEAKER_01]: Spank her!

01:28.483 --> 01:28.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

01:32.744 --> 01:33.884
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you do for your birthday, Nellie?

01:35.725 --> 01:36.305
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, get her mic.

01:36.565 --> 01:36.905
[SPEAKER_01]: Get her mic.

01:39.116 --> 01:40.217
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, stop spanking her.

01:40.277 --> 01:42.337
[SPEAKER_01]: Get her out of my way.

01:42.577 --> 01:43.318
[SPEAKER_01]: What did Nellie do today?

01:45.338 --> 01:49.400
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt took me out to breakfast, and then we went to my mom's house, and I had cake there.

01:49.980 --> 01:53.341
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I came here, and we went to the Olive Garden.

01:53.361 --> 01:54.522
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, I ate all day.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.983
[SPEAKER_07]: And yesterday... I know, it's delicious.

01:58.043 --> 01:59.063
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate all weekend, actually.

01:59.103 --> 02:02.144
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to Joe's Crab Shack yesterday.

02:03.185 --> 02:05.846
[SPEAKER_07]: I got barbecue crab, and I highly recommend it.

02:07.066 --> 02:09.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing, because my friends don't like me.

02:09.888 --> 02:10.408
[SPEAKER_01]: I like you.

02:10.708 --> 02:11.689
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, you didn't do anything.

02:12.189 --> 02:13.950
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

02:14.370 --> 02:15.130
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hurt.

02:15.891 --> 02:17.352
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't do anything for your birthday either.

02:17.372 --> 02:19.092
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have a party.

02:19.112 --> 02:20.513
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take you on a shopping spree at Walmart.

02:21.554 --> 02:23.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's my favorite store.

02:23.975 --> 02:25.476
[SPEAKER_01]: Ew, Target's way better.

02:26.707 --> 02:27.587
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys, I'm eating.

02:27.607 --> 02:31.068
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're supposed to be doing a radio program here, but now the podcast is over, I don't care.

02:31.528 --> 02:32.849
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast is the important show.

02:32.909 --> 02:34.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, one of our listeners has a question.

02:34.449 --> 02:34.909
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what?

02:35.849 --> 02:38.970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about if you can play the wave bird on the Wii.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.831
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, find out when it comes out.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the port things aren't the right size.

02:45.352 --> 02:46.192
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they are, no.

02:46.492 --> 02:47.253
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to.

02:47.953 --> 02:48.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

02:48.733 --> 02:49.053
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

02:51.154 --> 02:52.234
[SPEAKER_04]: This Jeremy Todd one.

02:52.987 --> 02:58.170
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm eating an Olive Garden breadstick and enjoying the breadsticky goodness.

02:58.190 --> 03:00.392
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking for the remote control?

03:01.032 --> 03:03.253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out there somewhere and the damn thing keeps getting lost.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.474
[SPEAKER_01]: Look in the couch cushions.

03:04.634 --> 03:08.016
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had today three... Wait, make Annie come in here.

03:08.317 --> 03:09.217
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Annie on the show.

03:10.038 --> 03:16.542
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had today three small whole wheat pitas with baba ganoush, which is basically eggplant dip.

03:17.622 --> 03:21.865
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a small piece of 85% dark chocolate and four Ritz crackers.

03:23.513 --> 03:26.175
[SPEAKER_01]: Silent Hill 1, The Old School Yes

03:53.018 --> 03:55.900
[SPEAKER_01]: and why did you decide to start playing Silent Hill?

03:55.920 --> 03:56.961
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Shane bought it.

03:57.701 --> 03:58.302
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane bought it?

03:58.562 --> 03:59.142
[SPEAKER_00]: No, brought it.

03:59.262 --> 04:00.783
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you... Oh, he's not here.

04:01.204 --> 04:03.065
[SPEAKER_01]: Miklatov is how our listeners know him, but that's alright.

04:04.166 --> 04:05.226
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that how they know you?

04:05.246 --> 04:06.647
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was supposed to watch.

04:12.179 --> 04:13.200
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to play through this time.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.482
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the experience would be so much better if I played because I always think that it's not scary whenever he plays.

04:16.502 --> 04:16.702
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some.

04:16.722 --> 04:18.164
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a lot of Pump It Up lately.

04:18.264 --> 04:18.524
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yay!

04:38.695 --> 04:38.915
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

04:38.955 --> 04:41.197
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.

04:41.497 --> 04:43.899
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you ever played a lot of scary games before?

04:44.099 --> 04:44.199
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

04:44.600 --> 04:44.740
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

04:44.820 --> 04:46.161
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like the first scary game you were playing?

04:46.181 --> 04:48.002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it terrified me to everything.

04:48.363 --> 04:52.986
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really, you were the one coming in every once in a while going, you're screaming again.

04:53.146 --> 04:57.770
[SPEAKER_01]: No, let me do my impression of Annie playing Silent Hill, is that every five seconds you're like, oh my god!

04:58.450 --> 05:21.800
[SPEAKER_01]: and then like you hear like 60 gunshots and then she's on my bullet is it dead because she's not even looking at the screen she starts screaming i know i held out the controller and closed my eyes so for those people that say a video game can't be scary what would you what would be your response it can as long as you're the one playing it yeah what makes it more scary when you're the one playing it

05:22.403 --> 05:23.324
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to play through three.

05:46.037 --> 05:46.738
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 is my favorite.

05:47.518 --> 05:47.878
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

05:48.499 --> 05:48.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

05:48.619 --> 05:49.279
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

05:49.779 --> 05:51.841
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the worst one.

05:51.861 --> 05:53.502
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 is my favorite because of Heza Beam.

05:54.402 --> 05:54.682
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

05:55.683 --> 05:55.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Heather.

05:56.584 --> 05:58.825
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a special beam power.

05:59.205 --> 06:00.866
[SPEAKER_04]: She has the sexy beam.

06:01.166 --> 06:04.328
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she has Heather Beam the first time around and then she gets sexy beam.

06:06.369 --> 06:07.790
[SPEAKER_04]: She has Heather Beam and sexy beam.

06:08.131 --> 06:09.071
[SPEAKER_04]: And I prefer Heather Beam.

06:09.551 --> 06:10.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's Heza Beam.

06:11.473 --> 06:11.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Heza...

06:12.653 --> 06:14.114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you on my game because I'm cheating.

06:14.855 --> 06:15.375
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cheating?

06:15.595 --> 06:16.556
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cheating hardcore.

06:17.217 --> 06:18.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

06:18.418 --> 06:19.879
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got all items, all maps.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.520
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you cheat through Silent Hill?

06:22.000 --> 06:22.781
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.

06:22.821 --> 06:23.261
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you did?

06:23.761 --> 06:25.803
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because we were so lost at the end of it.

06:25.883 --> 06:26.583
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what to do.

06:26.624 --> 06:27.704
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you went on GameFAQs.

06:28.185 --> 06:28.605
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

06:29.346 --> 06:31.587
[SPEAKER_04]: My idea of cheating is putting in a game shark.

06:32.368 --> 06:35.250
[SPEAKER_01]: Using codes, like up, up, down, down, left, right type thing.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.871
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm only playing it for the story.

06:36.911 --> 06:39.433
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we only did it for figuring out things.

06:41.994 --> 06:45.776
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to play any other scary games like Resident Evil, Siren, anything else?

06:45.876 --> 06:47.337
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really too familiar.

06:47.857 --> 06:49.138
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say is your favorite video game?

06:51.219 --> 06:52.100
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably Silent Hill now.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.240
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.141
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.481
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.702
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your favorite video game before yesterday?

07:00.242 --> 07:04.203
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say Kingdom Hearts, but it hasn't really been my favorite for a while now.

07:05.124 --> 07:07.244
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's getting, you know, kind of boring.

07:07.944 --> 07:08.345
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.

07:08.785 --> 07:12.146
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened up the chat room if anybody wanted to ask Annie a question.

07:12.446 --> 07:13.986
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some questions from the chat.

07:14.766 --> 07:15.167
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

07:15.387 --> 07:18.087
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy Todd wants to know, does she like bacon?

07:19.008 --> 07:19.428
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

07:20.768 --> 07:21.228
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.

07:22.169 --> 07:22.809
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

07:24.629 --> 07:27.850
[SPEAKER_01]: VXJasonXV wants to know if you've ever played a game called Fatal Frame.

07:28.551 --> 07:29.051
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

07:33.027 --> 07:36.809
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we were a TV show because she's saying, of course, she's shaking her head.

07:36.829 --> 07:38.710
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to lie to the listeners just to be cool.

07:39.271 --> 07:40.351
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be cool.

07:40.752 --> 07:41.772
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

07:42.232 --> 07:42.733
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

07:42.773 --> 07:45.014
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these questions are inappropriate.

07:45.054 --> 07:46.335
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're getting inappropriate.

07:46.415 --> 07:48.156
[SPEAKER_01]: Now DMM wants to know if you're single.

07:48.856 --> 07:49.136
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

07:50.037 --> 07:50.877
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.

07:51.057 --> 07:51.798
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.

07:51.898 --> 07:54.800
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to know if you like dark meat.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.262
[SPEAKER_00]: If I like dark meats, like on a turkey or something?

07:58.282 --> 07:58.862
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.

07:59.082 --> 07:59.342
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

08:00.623 --> 08:01.384
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

08:03.326 --> 08:03.886
[SPEAKER_00]: No comments.

08:05.507 --> 08:06.068
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's right.

08:06.128 --> 08:06.969
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't acknowledge that.

08:07.029 --> 08:07.989
[SPEAKER_01]: That's trash.

08:08.310 --> 08:09.270
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't acknowledge that trash.

08:10.311 --> 08:15.135
[SPEAKER_01]: And she might be single, boys, but she's always going to be together with Jesus Christ and not with any of you.

08:15.235 --> 08:17.217
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know what?

08:17.237 --> 08:19.118
[SPEAKER_00]: Buzz off.

08:19.759 --> 08:20.780
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm married to Jesus.

08:23.162 --> 08:25.103
[SPEAKER_01]: God, you guys ask some lame questions here.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.204
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I ask some good ones.

08:26.604 --> 08:28.466
[SPEAKER_01]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, paper or plastic?

08:29.344 --> 08:31.306
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, paper all the way.

08:34.008 --> 08:37.531
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, lastly, Jeremy Todd 1 wants to know, what size are your shoes?

08:38.392 --> 08:40.133
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think seven and a half.

08:41.577 --> 08:42.798
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that important?

08:43.138 --> 08:43.538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

08:43.558 --> 08:48.082
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say no more questions for Annie.

08:49.402 --> 08:50.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, here's a good one.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.324
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let this go.

08:51.444 --> 08:52.285
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good question.

08:52.705 --> 08:55.487
[SPEAKER_01]: Ranma wants to know, PSP or DS?

08:55.547 --> 08:56.007
[SPEAKER_00]: DS.

08:56.508 --> 08:56.708
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

08:57.008 --> 08:58.509
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so great.

08:59.830 --> 09:00.871
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love Tetris.

09:01.031 --> 09:01.971
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it so much.

09:02.892 --> 09:04.233
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever played Luminous on the PSP?

09:04.433 --> 09:04.673
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

09:05.834 --> 09:06.174
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.

09:06.495 --> 09:06.775
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.

09:07.115 --> 09:07.375
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.

09:07.736 --> 09:07.916
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

09:08.556 --> 09:09.017
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, fair enough.

09:09.538 --> 09:10.679
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming on the show, Annie.

09:10.699 --> 09:11.600
[SPEAKER_01]: Last minute, I appreciate it.

09:11.741 --> 09:12.281
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.366
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick around if you want, but otherwise, we're gonna... I'm gonna go, bye.

09:15.506 --> 09:16.026
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's fine.

09:17.268 --> 09:18.530
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a good sport, ladies and gentlemen.

09:18.550 --> 09:21.354
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, by the way, just to make the chat room shut up.

09:22.475 --> 09:23.116
[SPEAKER_04]: Bacon!

09:24.558 --> 09:26.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

09:27.059 --> 09:28.621
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

09:44.475 --> 09:51.759
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like bringing up the sliced off fat of a dead pig that people eat.

09:52.039 --> 09:55.621
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nasty.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sporting my I Love Bacon shirt.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.183
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's delicious is veal.

10:01.324 --> 10:02.204
[SPEAKER_01]: Mmm, baby cow.

10:02.605 --> 10:02.965
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.

10:05.886 --> 10:07.268
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about your sister tonight.

10:07.288 --> 10:07.848
[SPEAKER_01]: We're done with you.

10:07.868 --> 10:08.829
[SPEAKER_01]: The meat's so tender.

10:09.370 --> 10:11.572
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a meat-eater, though, I was fond of lamb.

10:12.273 --> 10:13.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have such a thing as, like, baby pig?

10:14.175 --> 10:16.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can you get, like, baby pig and bacon?

10:16.517 --> 10:20.641
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I want to get to the cage match, boys and girls, because I'm retiring tonight.

10:20.741 --> 10:23.023
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we are going to retire your song?

10:23.043 --> 10:24.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's been in rotation for four weeks.

10:24.625 --> 10:24.985
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it?

10:25.205 --> 10:25.806
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was three.

10:25.846 --> 10:26.206
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.086
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

10:27.426 --> 10:28.387
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while anyways.

10:28.427 --> 10:28.907
[SPEAKER_01]: People forgot.

10:28.947 --> 10:31.268
[SPEAKER_01]: But just so you guys know, here it is.

10:31.348 --> 10:33.469
[SPEAKER_01]: It's officially being retired from the cage match.

10:33.890 --> 10:35.250
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot Topic is not punk rock.

10:35.290 --> 10:35.771
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a clip.

10:36.131 --> 10:37.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Topic is not punk rock.

10:37.611 --> 10:38.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Topic is not punk rock.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.051
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that song gets retired.

10:56.071 --> 10:58.373
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been officially played in Hot Topic now.

10:58.613 --> 11:04.557
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't win four times, but because of E3 and Faname, it just kind of stuck around for four weeks.

11:04.577 --> 11:05.077
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of sick of it.

11:05.097 --> 11:05.618
[SPEAKER_01]: It snuck by.

11:06.078 --> 11:10.541
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so DarkSakura's going to put a new song in tonight's cage match, so here we go with tonight's cage match.

11:10.561 --> 11:11.302
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's horrible.

11:11.642 --> 11:12.222
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, hold on.

11:12.282 --> 11:12.783
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet.

11:12.803 --> 11:18.366
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have to remind the folks who are listening, you have to be in the chat room to participate in...

11:20.968 --> 11:24.031
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura has song... Wait, no, there's no time for birthday presents.

11:24.051 --> 11:24.911
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to introduce your song.

11:24.931 --> 11:25.031
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

11:25.051 --> 11:25.151
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

11:52.562 --> 11:54.328
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fighting about a president right now.

12:01.889 --> 12:02.429
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you so girly?

12:02.870 --> 12:03.150
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

12:03.350 --> 12:03.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

12:03.951 --> 12:05.572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm butting notes of Vanessa.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.553
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy her a porno book.

12:06.573 --> 12:08.774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, buy her a porn book, something like that.

12:08.794 --> 12:13.018
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the penthouse, like letters to penthouse compilation book.

12:13.078 --> 12:13.398
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

12:13.418 --> 12:14.919
[SPEAKER_07]: You better watch out because I'll order it too.

12:15.079 --> 12:16.140
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like three of them.

12:17.341 --> 12:17.681
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

12:18.062 --> 12:18.742
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you want?

12:18.782 --> 12:19.763
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a letters to penthouse?

12:20.344 --> 12:21.384
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just regular books.

12:21.444 --> 12:22.605
[SPEAKER_04]: I like reading.

12:22.705 --> 12:22.966
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

12:23.286 --> 12:24.247
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's your favorite author?

12:25.267 --> 12:25.628
[SPEAKER_04]: Anne Rice.

12:26.668 --> 12:28.990
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a... I... I don't know.

12:29.010 --> 12:30.592
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Anne Rice writes gay porno.

12:31.728 --> 12:34.089
[SPEAKER_04]: and Rice for the Erotic Adventures of Sleeping Beauty.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are gross.

12:35.790 --> 12:36.110
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

12:36.670 --> 12:37.370
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have those.

12:37.451 --> 12:38.551
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do the cage match now, please?

12:38.771 --> 12:39.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

12:40.112 --> 12:41.392
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what's your pick?

12:41.432 --> 12:42.933
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let me borrow.

12:43.193 --> 12:44.614
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your pick for tonight's cage match?

12:44.634 --> 12:47.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of porn, Tracy Lord's Say Something.

12:47.795 --> 12:49.596
[SPEAKER_01]: Appropriate segue there.

12:49.616 --> 12:49.916
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

12:50.816 --> 12:51.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to say about it?

12:52.197 --> 12:53.337
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Tracy Lord's.

12:53.997 --> 12:55.058
[SPEAKER_04]: She was also in Cry Baby.

12:55.178 --> 12:57.539
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is, song number one tonight, boys and girls.

12:57.619 --> 12:59.200
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracy Lord's with Say Something.

12:59.320 --> 12:59.620
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.

13:07.608 --> 13:09.310
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

14:08.345 --> 14:09.532
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

14:50.069 --> 14:52.001
Thanks for watching!

16:28.171 --> 16:33.137
Thanks for watching!

17:10.370 --> 17:14.074
[SPEAKER_01]: I give this soup though an 8 because it has way too many beans in it.

17:32.031 --> 17:34.393
[SPEAKER_01]: I give that song, I didn't really dig it, I have to admit.

17:34.413 --> 17:36.194
[SPEAKER_01]: I like some of Trace Lord's other stuff, but not that one.

17:36.214 --> 17:38.135
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of was a little soft to me.

17:38.155 --> 17:38.876
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give it a five.

17:39.376 --> 17:41.057
[SPEAKER_01]: Very middle of the road for me.

17:41.097 --> 17:41.978
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what'd you pick tonight?

17:44.269 --> 17:55.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so out of the middle of nowhere here, I actually, there was a song, of course, I put in Cage Match today from Burnout Revenge, you may remember, by Junkie XL.

17:55.594 --> 18:02.498
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, that is the single from his new album, which is also called Today, which I bought today.

18:03.038 --> 18:08.140
[SPEAKER_03]: And ironically enough, I bought an album instead of downloading it off the internet because I couldn't find this one.

18:08.621 --> 18:13.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so this is song number two on the album called Mushroom.

18:14.043 --> 18:15.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Junkie XL with Mushroom

18:45.558 --> 18:47.249
Thanks for watching!

22:02.781 --> 22:03.827
Thanks for watching!

22:32.345 --> 22:33.067
Thank you for watching!

24:00.368 --> 24:01.190
Thanks for watching!

25:12.259 --> 25:12.782
Thank you.

25:22.591 --> 25:23.271
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura gets a 9

25:44.298 --> 25:47.780
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's now go to the third song tonight, which is my pick.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.661
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my pick tonight, I picked a cover of a Journey song.

25:51.701 --> 25:53.262
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dance cover of a Journey song.

25:53.602 --> 25:56.223
[SPEAKER_01]: And Journey is awesome, and this cover's not bad.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.183
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that bad.

25:57.444 --> 25:58.884
[SPEAKER_01]: Annie just gave me a thumbs up from the hallway.

25:58.924 --> 25:59.765
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows Journey's awesome.

26:00.145 --> 26:03.146
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Judy Torres, and the name of the song is Faithfully.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.427
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my cage match pick tonight.

26:05.507 --> 26:05.847
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.

26:06.247 --> 26:08.028
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about how awesome Journey is when you hear it.

27:40.366 --> 27:41.212
[SPEAKER_10]: Faithfully

28:58.486 --> 28:59.138
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

30:22.355 --> 30:22.676
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

30:34.031 --> 30:45.274
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't set out to savage the stuff that you take out, but I hate songs that I really like being covered like that, especially by people who can't sing.

30:46.294 --> 30:46.914
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets a 2.

30:47.094 --> 30:48.494
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

30:49.595 --> 30:51.095
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like that either, I'm sorry.

30:51.415 --> 30:54.136
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just very, eh.

30:55.376 --> 30:57.996
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite a 2 though, but I mean, the end was kind of cool.

30:58.016 --> 30:57.996
5.

30:58.416 --> 30:58.797
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

31:00.897 --> 31:01.978
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give it a 10, you know why?

31:01.998 --> 31:04.319
[SPEAKER_01]: Because finally I recognize the song that you guys played!

31:16.205 --> 31:16.966
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally!

31:17.766 --> 31:20.168
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if it's a bad cover, I recognize it.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.249
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate Ted.

31:23.369 --> 31:25.531
[SPEAKER_01]: I unfortunately can't be that generous to my own song.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.251
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it an 8.

31:26.731 --> 31:31.154
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Journey, and I don't care if she covered it and maybe bastardized it a little bit.

31:31.174 --> 31:33.736
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me happy, because she made it a happy song.

31:33.756 --> 31:36.897
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's recap so you guys can vote for your favorite song.

31:36.917 --> 31:38.518
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.

31:38.598 --> 31:40.980
[SPEAKER_01]: Song numero uno, Tracy Lord, Say Something.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.921
[SPEAKER_01]: Song number two tonight is Junkie XL with Mushroom.

32:02.387 --> 32:08.611
[SPEAKER_01]: And song number three in tonight's cage match was Faithfully, Valentin's Dance Edit by Judy Torres.

32:17.642 --> 32:20.964
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why the one through iTunes comes so quiet.

32:20.984 --> 32:21.945
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize to that, guys.

32:22.005 --> 32:24.106
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, and Loki, please refrain from commenting on that.

32:24.466 --> 32:25.067
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there you go.

32:25.127 --> 32:26.788
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are three songs you can vote for tonight.

32:26.828 --> 32:28.629
[SPEAKER_01]: So please place vote now.

32:28.689 --> 32:31.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

32:31.611 --> 32:35.654
[SPEAKER_01]: Song number one, song number two, or song numero three.

32:36.254 --> 32:39.056
[SPEAKER_01]: And our lovely ops there in chat will tell you how to vote.

32:39.116 --> 32:41.077
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't already know, you just send me a private message.

32:41.177 --> 32:42.318
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask one of them if you don't know how.

32:43.279 --> 32:45.860
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're about ready to wrap things up here in studio.

32:48.101 --> 32:50.383
[SPEAKER_01]: Any exciting plans for this upcoming week that you guys have?

32:51.584 --> 32:52.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, food.

32:53.766 --> 32:55.067
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, we're going to go get food very soon.

32:55.087 --> 32:55.727
[SPEAKER_04]: My doll's arriving.

32:56.148 --> 32:56.368
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm?

32:56.428 --> 32:57.349
[SPEAKER_04]: My doll arrives on Tuesday.

32:57.369 --> 32:59.690
[SPEAKER_01]: What is up with you getting back into the dolly stuff or whatever it is?

33:00.231 --> 33:01.432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the customizable thing.

33:01.552 --> 33:05.015
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically, for me, it's like, I love to customize things.

33:05.075 --> 33:10.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I love anything that is art and hobby and, you know, models.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.321
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, I think, the perfect thing for me.

33:12.341 --> 33:13.782
[SPEAKER_04]: I also am using it to learn how to sew.

33:17.588 --> 33:20.870
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of relates to a story I have from last night, is that Annie and I were at Walmart.

33:20.910 --> 33:22.350
[SPEAKER_01]: We were actually with Shane, but he was in the bathroom.

33:22.651 --> 33:25.472
[SPEAKER_01]: So Annie and I were kind of walking around the crafting area at Walmart.

33:25.492 --> 33:28.013
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Walmart Supercenter, so it's a huge crafting area.

33:28.494 --> 33:30.915
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were thinking about buying ourselves a project.

33:31.295 --> 33:32.816
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, remember when you were kids...

33:33.596 --> 33:34.077
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

33:52.295 --> 33:52.735
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

34:09.873 --> 34:12.936
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sad and then people would buy it at conventions for lots of money.

34:13.176 --> 34:13.596
[SPEAKER_07]: They would.

34:13.776 --> 34:14.016
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

34:14.677 --> 34:15.598
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I need to learn how to do it.

34:15.618 --> 34:16.558
[SPEAKER_07]: Or cross stitch.

34:17.439 --> 34:18.100
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really easy.

34:18.140 --> 34:21.743
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just make, I'll put Sora on a pillow and people will buy it.

34:22.363 --> 34:22.863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

34:22.883 --> 34:23.464
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're whores.

34:24.004 --> 34:24.345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

34:26.586 --> 34:30.068
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tally up votes, so Loki, tell us a funny story or something.

34:30.308 --> 34:31.329
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up and get your votes in, guys.

34:31.869 --> 34:39.594
[SPEAKER_03]: Once was a funny lawyer named Jack Thompson who said funny things like, nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

34:40.494 --> 34:41.115
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the funny thing, though, I had to laugh about.

34:44.336 --> 34:47.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

34:48.099 --> 34:50.240
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe the vice president shot somebody in the face.

34:51.892 --> 34:53.393
[SPEAKER_03]: I never knew the vice president played video games.

34:53.553 --> 34:54.654
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that him in the picture?

34:54.955 --> 34:55.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

34:55.675 --> 34:57.497
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like a really old Jon Stewart.

34:59.980 --> 35:00.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.981
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he's crazy.

35:03.081 --> 35:24.446
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically saying, you know, trying to get these people to go in Louisiana, you know, basically trying to get this sheriff to go back out and check this 16-year-old's house looking for video games because he's saying that video games caused this kid to shoot somebody in the face and beat somebody to death.

35:24.546 --> 35:25.246
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say...

35:25.746 --> 35:27.587
[SPEAKER_04]: His own choice made him do it.

35:28.127 --> 35:32.270
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the video game did not do that, but... Yeah, of course he's gonna have a video game.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.131
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like saying, well, TV made him do it.

35:34.151 --> 35:35.152
[SPEAKER_03]: See if he has a TV.

35:35.352 --> 35:37.313
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was that crazy electricity.

35:37.633 --> 35:39.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Electricity made him kill.

35:41.395 --> 35:41.655
[SPEAKER_01]: Lame.

35:44.797 --> 35:46.739
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, kids, you wanna hear who won tonight's cage match?

35:47.339 --> 35:47.559
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

35:47.819 --> 35:48.119
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

35:48.980 --> 35:53.823
[SPEAKER_01]: All the songs got a little love tonight, but in the end, one song got a lot more love than the other two, and it was...

35:55.134 --> 36:00.818
[SPEAKER_01]: Junkie XL with Mushroom Oh, you chat kids are too predictable sometimes.

36:01.958 --> 36:03.579
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what you voted for, so enjoy it.

36:04.860 --> 36:07.602
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that's going to do it, guys.

36:08.242 --> 36:09.183
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for tuning in.

36:09.203 --> 36:14.106
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry we don't have time for chat room reviews, but DarkSakura and I are about to eat our fingers if we don't get food soon.

36:14.426 --> 36:16.247
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.

36:16.287 --> 36:16.568
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

36:17.608 --> 36:23.352
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what a ninja thinks about Dance Dance Revolution, Karaoke Revolution, and the French Revolution.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.392
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

36:28.173 --> 36:28.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Reject false icons.

36:29.494 --> 36:32.137
[SPEAKER_01]: And my final, final thought is finger.

36:33.118 --> 36:34.659
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fortune cookie message of the day.

36:34.719 --> 36:35.400
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't forget that.

36:35.680 --> 36:35.920
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

36:36.161 --> 36:36.941
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it comes.

36:37.382 --> 36:38.563
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to load it up here.

36:40.625 --> 36:44.869
[SPEAKER_01]: Boys and girls, here comes your fortune cookie message of the day.

36:48.092 --> 36:49.474
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy, this is a good one tonight.

36:49.534 --> 36:49.794
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.

36:56.192 --> 36:56.696
[SPEAKER_01]: Dance, Loki.

39:34.980 --> 39:36.101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, that was fun.

39:36.161 --> 39:38.202
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelly finally taught me how to do the dance because I forgot it.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.203
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's just this.

39:39.843 --> 39:40.664
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, we're radio.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.946
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to get a webcam soon, though, again, so we can do that again.

39:44.767 --> 39:52.472
[SPEAKER_08]: The duck quacky beak with your hands, then you do the little chicken thing with your elbows, and then you do the twisty thing with your butt, and then you clap.

39:53.773 --> 39:55.174
[SPEAKER_01]: You clap because you just danced with your butt.

39:55.634 --> 39:56.835
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you, guys.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.537
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yes, that was Loki's old FU music from a long time ago.

39:59.577 --> 40:02.419
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you old school OLR fans remember that.

40:02.782 --> 40:03.703
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's it, guys.

40:03.803 --> 40:04.944
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking off here.

40:05.024 --> 40:07.687
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so much for listening to us into this very late hour.

40:08.087 --> 40:09.328
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 1230 on the East Coast.

40:09.348 --> 40:09.889
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are nuts.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.390
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably morning time.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.551
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun's coming up over in Britain.

40:13.092 --> 40:14.913
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so much for listening and supporting us.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.335
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate you guys' support.

40:16.595 --> 40:25.624
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, podcast award nominations are coming up starting July 1st, and we're going to try and keep that within the independent radio community once again this year.

40:25.664 --> 40:28.006
[SPEAKER_01]: We're expecting a lot of competition from some of the corporate shows.
