00:00.000 --> 00:27.800
Alright kids, we're getting back here for Orange Lounge Radio, the after birth.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.060
This is the part of the show that's too hot for podcasting.

00:31.060 --> 00:32.860
It's scandalous stuff.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.400
Now this whole room smells like Italian food.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.400
Get that out of here.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.320
Oh, it's better than rotting milk.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
Stop putting that...

00:38.320 --> 00:39.320
Nellie?

00:39.320 --> 00:40.320
Would you put...

00:40.320 --> 00:41.320
Nellie, from the...

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
Yeah.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
From the three McFlurries.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.040
Fill your rotten milk cup away.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.040
For me?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.040
Can I have a breadstick?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
Yay.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.040
Because it smells...

00:51.040 --> 00:53.040
Three McFlurries and they're all rotting.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.040
Do you want a breadstick?

00:54.040 --> 00:55.040
Yes, I do.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.040
Thank you for the breadstick.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.040
Thank you for breadsticks.

01:26.040 --> 01:30.040
Yay! Okay, Nellie's bending over, spank her! Yay!

01:30.040 --> 01:34.040
What'd you do for your birthday, Nellie?

01:34.040 --> 01:38.040
I went to the Olive Garden. Wait, get her mic.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.040
Nellie, stop spanking her. Get her on the mic.

01:42.040 --> 01:46.040
What did Nellie do today? I went, okay, Matt took me out

01:46.040 --> 01:50.040

01:50.040 --> 01:54.040

02:53.080 --> 02:58.140
I am eating a Olive Garden bread stick and enjoying the bread sticky juice goodness

02:59.120 --> 03:05.300
You looking for the remote control. It's out there somewhere and the damn thing keeps getting lost look in the couch cushion. I've had today

03:06.080 --> 03:09.120
Wait bring make Annie come in here. I want Annie on the show

03:09.520 --> 03:16.920
I've had today three small whole wheat pitas with baba ganoush, which is basically eggplant dip mm-hmm

03:16.920 --> 03:22.000
I've had a small piece of eighty-five percent dark chocolate and four Ritz crackers.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.120
Alright. So yeah, breadstick.

03:25.120 --> 03:30.280
What we'll be eating soon. Hi! Hi, Annie! I wanted to invite you on the show. Don't worry, this isn't the podcast.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.120
Nobody, like, we have like maybe two people listening right now. It's not a big deal.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.920
So, um, I just wanted to ask you about what games you've been playing this week.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.200
You've been playing a game a lot this weekend. Annie, by the way, is X to first sister,

03:40.200 --> 03:43.520
everybody. Say hello to our listeners, Annie. Hello.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.800
yep you're on it's it's it's it's a hot mic they can hear you

03:46.800 --> 03:50.240
all right so what games have you been playing this weekend? Silent Hill

03:50.240 --> 03:53.880
like Silent Hill 1 the old school? yes and

03:53.880 --> 03:57.040
why did you decide to start playing Silent Hill? because Shane bought it

03:57.040 --> 04:00.840
Shane bought it? no brought it or did you? oh he's not here

04:00.840 --> 04:04.080
Miek LaTov is how our listeners know him but that's alright

04:04.080 --> 04:08.080
oh is that how they know you? cause I was supposed to watch

04:08.080 --> 04:11.080
well we just started last night and you weren't here

04:11.080 --> 04:17.080
So wait, what I want to know, and Shane, feel free to jump on the microphone if you want,

04:17.080 --> 04:23.080
why is Annie playing this time? Because Shane played through Silent Hill 2 and 4 when you guys were playing that.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.080
I didn't want to play through it this time.

04:25.080 --> 04:31.080
He said the experience would be so much better if I played, because I always think that it's not scary whenever he plays.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.080
Now do you play a lot of video games?

04:33.080 --> 04:36.080
Um, some. I've been playing a lot of Pump It Up lately.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.580
Mm-hmm. Yay!

04:38.580 --> 04:41.380
Alright. No way.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.480
So, have you ever played a lot of scary games before? No.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.480
No? So this is like the first scary game you've played? Yeah, and it terrified me to everything.

04:47.480 --> 04:51.980
Really? Well, really, you're the one coming in every once in a while going,

04:51.980 --> 04:55.980
You're screaming again! No, let me do my impression of Annie playing Silent Hill,

04:55.980 --> 05:00.680
is that every five seconds you're like, Oh my God! Ahh! And then, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof!

05:00.680 --> 05:05.780
Like, you hear, like, sixty gunshots, and then she goes, Is it dead?

05:05.780 --> 05:09.120
because she's not even looking at the screen, she starts screaming. I know, I held out the

05:09.120 --> 05:13.660
controller and closed my eyes. So for those people that say a video game can't be scary

05:13.660 --> 05:19.180
what would be your response? It can as long as you're the one playing it.

05:19.180 --> 05:22.340
Yeah. What makes it more scary when you're the one playing it?

05:22.340 --> 05:26.260
Because you don't expect anything, but it was always funny when Shane played it

05:26.260 --> 05:27.220
because he was

05:27.220 --> 05:31.660
you know, screaming like a little girl, so that's why it was so funny.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.560
Yeah you were, don't deny it.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.500
So, have you almost beaten the game?

05:36.500 --> 05:37.340
I beat it.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.400
You did? Yeah. Congratulations.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.560
Yay.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.680
So, now are you going to play through the others yourself, or? I'm going to play through three.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.680
I'm going to play through three.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.400
Three is my favorite.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.480
Is it?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.680
Yeah. What do you think?

05:49.680 --> 05:51.660
I think it's the worst one.

05:51.660 --> 05:54.320
Three is my favorite because it has that beam.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.480
What? Heather.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.720
She has a

05:57.720 --> 05:59.160
special beam power.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.080
A beam? She has the sexy beam. Power?

06:01.080 --> 06:05.440
no she has heather beam the first time around and she gets sexy beam

06:05.440 --> 06:09.600
for another she has heather beam and sexy beam and I prefer heather beam

06:09.600 --> 06:11.400
because it's heza beam

06:11.400 --> 06:12.280
heza

06:12.280 --> 06:14.880
I'll show you on my game because I'm cheating

06:14.880 --> 06:18.120
you're cheating? I'm cheating hardcore

06:18.120 --> 06:20.160
I've got all items, all maps

06:20.160 --> 06:21.880
would you cheat through silent name?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.720
we did

06:23.720 --> 06:26.400
no because we were so lost at the end of it we didn't know what to do

06:26.400 --> 06:28.080
okay you went on game facts

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
I don't know.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.500
My idea of cheating is putting in like a game shark.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
Using codes.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.320
Like an up, up, down, down, left, right type thing.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.840
Because I'm only playing it for the story.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.080
Yeah, we only did it for like figuring out things.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.080
Okay.

06:41.080 --> 06:45.520
Oh, are you going to play any other scary games like Resident Evil, Siren, anything

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
else?

06:46.520 --> 06:47.520
I'm not really too familiar.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.520
Okay.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
What would you say is your favorite video game?

06:49.520 --> 06:52.520
Probably Silent Hill now.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
I like it a lot.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.520
I really like it.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.520
It's so much fun.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.520
Okay.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.520
That's cool.

06:57.520 --> 07:05.520
I want to say Kingdom Hearts, but it hasn't really been my favorite for a while now.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.520
It's getting, you know, kind of boring.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.520
That's fair.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.520
I opened up the chat room if anybody wanted to ask Annie a question.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.520
So we have some questions from the chat.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.520
Let's see.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.520
Jeremy Todd wants to know, does she like bacon?

07:19.520 --> 07:21.520
Yummy.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.520
Let's see here.

07:24.520 --> 07:28.460
VXJsonXV wants to know if you've ever played a game called Fatal Frame.

07:28.460 --> 07:30.260
Of course.

07:30.260 --> 07:36.300
You're lying. I wish we were a TV show because she's saying of course.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.200
You don't have to lie to the listeners just to be cool.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.020
I'm not trying to be cool. They're cool.

07:42.020 --> 07:46.760
Some of these questions are inappropriate.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.540
Now DMM wants to know if you're single.

07:49.540 --> 07:52.540
Yes. Forever.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.540
I wanted to know if you like dark meat.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.540
If I like dark meat? Like on a turkey or something?

07:58.540 --> 08:00.540
No, I think you need black.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.540
Oh, okay.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.540
No comments.

08:04.540 --> 08:09.540
No, that's alright. Don't acknowledge that. That's trash. Don't acknowledge that trash.

08:09.540 --> 08:15.540
And she might be single boys, but she's always going to be together with Jesus Christ, and not with any of you.

08:15.540 --> 08:19.540
So, you know what? Buzz off.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.540
I'm married to Jesus.

08:21.540 --> 08:25.180
Okay, God, you guys ask some lame questions here.

08:25.180 --> 08:28.620
Yeah, ask some good ones. Legend of Zaku wants to know, paper or plastic?

08:28.620 --> 08:33.660
Paper all the way.

08:33.660 --> 08:37.700

08:37.700 --> 08:40.900

By the way, just to make the chat room shut up...

09:22.420 --> 09:23.720
BACON!

09:23.720 --> 09:26.240
It's nasty!

09:26.240 --> 09:28.240
It's disgusting!

09:28.240 --> 09:32.360
It's the fat off of a dead pig! Why haven't they been trying to get you to say bacon

09:32.360 --> 09:33.520
forever?

09:33.520 --> 09:36.640
I guess I think the other week they were trying to get me to say bacon, so...

09:36.640 --> 09:41.880
Whatever. Because both of you guys said it, and they want me to conform. What, is somebody pointing together like a bacon thing or

09:41.880 --> 09:43.680
something?

09:43.680 --> 09:51.680
I don't like bringing up the, you know, the sliced off fat of a dead pig that people eat.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.680
It's nasty.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.680
But it's still delicious.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Nasty.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.680
I'm sporting my Olive Bacon shirt.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.680
You know what's delicious is veal.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.680
We're done with you.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.680
A meat so tender.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.680
When I was a meat eater though I was fond of lamb.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
Alright.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.680

10:16.680 --> 10:21.680

10:21.680 --> 10:22.680

10:22.680 --> 10:24.680
Because it's been in rotation for four weeks.

10:24.680 --> 10:25.680

10:25.680 --> 10:26.680

10:26.680 --> 10:27.680
That's alright, I don't care.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.680

13:51.000 --> 14:09.440
I can see it all for me Here it comes now, it means nothing

14:09.440 --> 14:14.940
Just say something, just say something

14:14.940 --> 14:20.140
I think you know I am only here among us

14:20.140 --> 14:23.520
Say something

14:23.520 --> 14:29.440
I think you know i am only here among us

14:29.440 --> 14:33.140
Say something

14:33.140 --> 14:39.180
I think you know I am only here among us

15:09.180 --> 15:37.180
It's the summer of shame for me I can see the fall before me

15:37.180 --> 15:48.180
Please, how did you know I am only here among us?

15:48.180 --> 16:02.180
Say something

16:02.180 --> 16:07.420
Don't think you know why you're Wet

16:07.420 --> 16:08.940
Don't think you know why you're Wet

16:08.940 --> 16:10.680
Don't think you know why you're Wet

16:10.680 --> 16:13.300
Don't think you know why you're Wet

16:13.300 --> 16:16.420
Don't think you know why you're Wet

16:16.420 --> 16:23.980
Don't think you know why you're Wet

16:23.980 --> 16:25.980
🎵Music🎵

16:53.980 --> 17:14.980
The song number one by Dark Sakura was Say Something, and we're gonna say something about

17:14.980 --> 17:17.700
that song right now, good or bad, Dark Sakura.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.840
It's seven, it's very mellow.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.060
I mean, I like, it's better than some of the other stuff.

17:22.060 --> 17:23.060
Loki

17:23.060 --> 17:27.060
I guess a 7, because it was okay. It was just very chilled out.

17:27.060 --> 17:31.060
I give this soup, though, an 8, because it has way too many beans in it.

17:31.060 --> 17:34.060
I give that song... I didn't really dig it, I have to admit.

17:34.060 --> 17:36.060
I like some of Trace's other stuff, but not that one.

17:36.060 --> 17:39.060
That kind of was a little soft to me, so I give it a 5.

17:39.060 --> 17:41.060
Very middle of the road for me.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.060
Loki, what did you pick tonight?

17:44.060 --> 17:48.060
Okay, so out of the middle of nowhere here, I actually...

17:48.060 --> 17:55.060
There was a song, of course, I put in Cage Match today from Burnout Revenge, you may remember, by Junkie XL.

17:55.060 --> 18:02.060
And actually that is the single from his new album, which is also called Today, which I bought today.

18:02.060 --> 18:08.060
And ironically enough, I bought an album instead of downloading it off the internet, because I couldn't find this one.

18:08.060 --> 18:13.060
Anyways, so this is song number two on the album, called Mushroom.

18:13.060 --> 18:21.060
It's interesting because he actually did, um, he produced Sasha's last album, which was Air Dogger, I think.

18:21.060 --> 18:27.060
And it, the whole album feels very similar to that one, and this is kind of, I don't know, it's very unique, I like it.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.060
So, check it out.

18:28.060 --> 18:32.060
Alright, here it is kids, song number two tonight, Junky Uxell with Mushroom.

18:32.060 --> 18:39.060
Not Hollick, I want Mushroom.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.060
Oh

22:02.060 --> 22:04.060
Oh

24:02.060 --> 24:04.060
Oh

25:02.060 --> 25:25.860
Alright kids, that was song number two tonight, Junkie Uxl with Mushroom.

25:25.860 --> 25:27.860
Let's see what we thought of that one, Dark Sockrab.

25:27.860 --> 25:33.860
It put me to sleep. It was really repetitive and kind of not exciting, so I get to fly.

25:33.860 --> 25:34.860
Loki!

25:34.860 --> 25:38.860
It gets a 9 because it's cool and doesn't have badgering.

25:38.860 --> 25:42.860
Uh, it needs to be about half as long as it was. I give it a 6.

25:42.860 --> 25:47.860
Alright, let's now go to the third song tonight, which is my pick.

25:47.860 --> 25:52.860
And for my pick tonight, I picked a cover of a Journey song. It's a dance cover of a Journey song.

25:52.860 --> 25:56.860
And Journey is awesome, and this cover's not bad. It's not that bad.

25:56.860 --> 25:57.860
that bad.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.220
And he just gave me a thumbs up from the hallway, she knows Journey's awesome.

26:00.220 --> 26:04.900
So this is Judy Torres, and the name of the song is Faithfully, and it's my cage match

26:04.900 --> 26:05.900
pick tonight.

26:05.900 --> 26:06.900
Enjoy.

26:06.900 --> 26:13.900
awesome journey is when you hear it.

26:36.900 --> 26:43.900
I may run into the midnight sun

26:43.900 --> 26:49.900
The wheels go round and round, you're on my mind

26:49.900 --> 26:57.900
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight

26:57.900 --> 27:04.900
I'm sending all my love along the wire

27:04.900 --> 27:09.900
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family

27:12.900 --> 27:16.900
But right down the lane it's been you and me

27:18.900 --> 27:24.900
And loving somebody like me ain't always what it's supposed to be

27:25.900 --> 27:31.900
But you, you stand behind me

27:31.900 --> 27:41.900
I'm forever yours, faithfully

27:41.900 --> 28:07.900
Oh circus life, under the big dark world We all need the clouds, can you make us smile?

28:07.900 --> 28:10.900
Through space and time

28:11.900 --> 28:15.900
Always another show

28:15.900 --> 28:18.900
Wondering where I am

28:18.900 --> 28:22.900
Lost without you

28:22.900 --> 28:25.900
And being apart ain't easy

28:25.900 --> 28:28.900
All this love affair

28:28.900 --> 28:34.900
Two strangers learn to fall in love again

28:34.900 --> 28:42.900
And I get the joy of rediscovering you

28:42.900 --> 28:49.900
And do you stand by me

28:49.900 --> 28:55.900
I forever know

28:55.900 --> 28:59.900
Faithfully

29:15.900 --> 29:17.900
Faithfully

29:17.900 --> 29:39.900
I'm your yours, I'm forever yours, Yours

30:09.900 --> 30:16.900
You know, I don't set out to savage the stuff that you take out, but I have to say that

30:39.900 --> 30:45.900
I hate songs that I really like being covered like that, especially by people who can't sing.

30:45.900 --> 30:51.980
So it gets a two all right Loki. I don't like that either. I'm sorry. It's just very

30:54.940 --> 30:57.900
Not quite a two though, but I mean the end is kind of cool

30:58.580 --> 31:02.840
Five all right. Yeah, I like the end that ends my favorite part. Yes

31:02.840 --> 31:05.800
That's the kind of song I hear at the close of a gay club

31:07.300 --> 31:09.400
What Oh Nelly wants to review it yes Nelly

31:09.400 --> 31:11.400
I'm gonna give it a 10, you know why?

31:11.400 --> 31:11.900
Why?

31:11.900 --> 31:15.000
Because finally I recognize the song that you guys played!

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Finally!

31:17.000 --> 31:20.200
I don't care if it's a bad cover, I recognize it!

31:20.200 --> 31:21.700
Yay, 10!

31:21.700 --> 31:25.400
Okay, I unfortunately can't be that generous to my own song.

31:25.400 --> 31:31.000
I'll give it an 8, because I love Churney, and I don't care if she covered it and maybe bastardized it a little bit.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
It makes me happy, because she made it a happy song.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.800
Alright, anyway, let's recap so you guys can vote for your favorite song.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.400

ready to wrap things up here in studio. Any exciting plans for this upcoming week that

32:49.940 --> 32:50.940
you guys have?

32:50.940 --> 32:51.940
Food.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.820
I know. We're going to go get food very soon.

32:54.820 --> 32:55.820
My doll's arriving.

32:55.820 --> 32:56.820
Hm?

32:56.820 --> 32:57.820
My doll arrives on Tuesday.

32:57.820 --> 33:00.060
What is up with you getting back into the dolly stuff or whatever it is?

33:00.060 --> 33:03.580
It's the customizable thing. It's basically, for me, it's like

33:03.580 --> 33:06.700
I love to customize things. I love anything that is

33:06.700 --> 33:11.800
art and hobby and, you know, models and this is, I think, the perfect

33:11.800 --> 33:17.520
thing for me. I also am using it to learn how to sew.

33:17.520 --> 33:22.520
That kind of relates to a story I have from last night is that Annie and I were at Walmart. We were actually with Shane, but he was in the bathroom.

33:22.520 --> 33:26.140
So, Annie and I were kind of walking around the crafting area at Walmart. And this is the Walmart

33:26.140 --> 33:28.380
Supercenters. It's a huge crafting area.

33:28.380 --> 33:32.100
and we were thinking about buying ourselves a project. Like remember when

33:32.100 --> 33:32.940
you were kids

33:32.940 --> 33:36.900
they had like those stained glass things that you put the little crystals in

33:36.900 --> 33:39.820
and you can put it in the oven and they make like a stained glass little

33:39.820 --> 33:43.740
cartoon character or whatever. Or the coasters, you put the little beads in the thing and then

33:43.740 --> 33:44.340
iron it

33:44.340 --> 33:47.820
and it's a coaster. We were thinking about buying one of those. We didn't. And then we thought about

33:47.820 --> 33:49.260
taking up crocheting.

33:49.260 --> 33:53.300
Like we were going to make scarves for no good reason. I know how to knit.

33:53.300 --> 33:57.060
I can teach you how to make a scarf. You should teach me how to make a scarf. That would be fun.

33:57.060 --> 34:01.260
You'll make somebody a great wife one day. I can make orange lounge scarves, wouldn't that be great?

34:01.260 --> 34:05.500
I can teach you how to do that. All I would have to do, or like get one of those patterns

34:05.500 --> 34:05.980
with like

34:05.980 --> 34:09.700
the Care Bear patterns, but make the Care Bear like black

34:09.700 --> 34:13.060
and sad and then people would buy it at conventions for lots of money.

34:13.060 --> 34:16.820
They would. I know. That's why you need to learn how to do it. Or cross stitch.

34:16.820 --> 34:20.060
Mm-hmm. That's really easy. I'll just make, I'll put Sora

34:20.060 --> 34:23.580
on a pillow and people will buy it. Yeah, I don't know. Cause they're whores.

34:23.580 --> 34:24.580
Okay.

34:24.580 --> 34:30.180
All right, I have to tally up votes, so, Loki, tell us a funny story or something.

34:30.180 --> 34:31.980
Hurry up and get your votes in, guys.

34:31.980 --> 34:36.500
Once was a funny lawyer named Jack Thompson who said funny things like, nobody shoots

34:36.500 --> 34:40.100
anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

34:40.100 --> 34:42.020
I saw that.

34:42.020 --> 34:44.580
Here's the funny thing, though, I had to laugh about.

34:44.580 --> 34:48.020
Nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hitman or a video gamer.

34:48.020 --> 34:51.840
I do believe the vice president shot somebody in the face.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.440
I never knew the vice president played video games.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.880
Is that him in the picture?

34:54.880 --> 34:55.520
Yes, it is.

34:55.520 --> 34:58.920
He looks like a really old Jon Stewart.

34:58.920 --> 34:59.920
Does he?

34:59.920 --> 35:01.000
Kind of.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
But yeah, he's crazy.

35:03.000 --> 35:09.360
He's basically trying to get these people to go.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.120
Louisiana, basically trying to get the sheriff

35:13.120 --> 35:18.220
to go back out and check this 16-year-old's house looking

35:18.220 --> 35:19.760
for video games because he's saying

35:19.760 --> 35:25.040
video games cause this kid to shoot somebody in the face and beat somebody to death and I say

35:25.680 --> 35:31.600
no choice made him do it no no the video game did not do that but yeah of course he's gonna

35:31.600 --> 35:35.200
have a video game that's just like saying old tv made him do it see if he has a tv

35:35.200 --> 35:39.040
i think it was that crazy electricity electricity made him kill

35:41.280 --> 35:41.780
lame

35:44.560 --> 35:49.600
all right kids you want to hear who won tonight's cage match sure all right uh all the songs got

35:49.600 --> 35:53.000
got a little love tonight, but in the end, one song got a lot more love than the other

35:53.000 --> 35:57.960
two, and it was Junkie XL with Mushroom.

35:57.960 --> 36:02.280
Oh, you chat kids are too predictable sometimes.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.960
That's what you voted for, so enjoy it.

36:04.960 --> 36:08.400
All right, that's going to do it, guys.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
Thanks so much for tuning in.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.800
Sorry we don't have time for chat room reviews, but Dark Soccer and I are about to eat our

36:12.800 --> 36:14.520
fingers if we don't get food soon.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.880
So let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
Loki.

36:17.880 --> 36:24.880
I want to know what a ninja thinks about dance dance revolution, karaoke revolution, and the French Revolution.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.880
Darkstalker, your final thought?

36:27.880 --> 36:29.880
Reject false icons.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.880
And my final, final thought is finger.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.880
Oh, fortune cookie message of the day. Can't forget that.

36:35.880 --> 36:39.880
Here it comes. I just have to load it up here.

36:39.880 --> 36:46.880
Boys and girls, here comes your fortune cookie message of the day.

36:46.880 --> 36:53.880
Oh boy, this is a good one tonight, enjoy!

36:53.880 --> 37:00.880
dance Loki

37:23.880 --> 37:25.880
Oh

38:23.880 --> 38:25.880
Oh

38:53.880 --> 38:54.880
Hey!

38:54.880 --> 38:55.880
Hey!

38:55.880 --> 38:56.880
Hey!

38:56.880 --> 38:57.880
Hey!

38:57.880 --> 38:58.880
Hey!

39:28.880 --> 39:36.200
Yay, that was fun.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.160
Nellie finally taught me how to do the dance because I forgot it, but you know, it's just

39:39.160 --> 39:41.440
this, oh wait, we're radio.

39:41.440 --> 39:44.840
I'm hoping to get a webcam soon though again so we can do that again.

39:44.840 --> 39:49.080
The duck quacky beak with your hands, then you do the little chicken thing with your

39:49.080 --> 39:53.840
elbows, and then you do the twisty thing with your butt, and then you clap.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.600
You clap because you just danced with your butt.

39:55.600 --> 39:59.600
All right, thank you guys, and yes, that was Loki's old F.U. music from a long time ago.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.600
Those of you old school O.L.R. fans remember that.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.600
All right, that's it, guys. We're taking off here.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.600
Thank you guys so much for listening to us into this very late hour.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.600
It's like 1230 on the East Coast. You guys are nuts.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.600
Probably morning time. The sun's coming up over in Britain.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.600
Thank you guys so much for listening and supporting us.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.600
We really appreciate you guys' support.

40:16.600 --> 40:20.600
Just so you know, podcast award nominations are coming up starting July 1st,

40:20.600 --> 40:25.320
We're going to try and keep that within the independent radio community once again this

40:25.320 --> 40:26.320
year.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.040
of competition from some of the corporate shows.
