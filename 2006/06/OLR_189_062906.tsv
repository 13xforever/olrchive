14385	21966	Tonight, the PlayStation 3 gets a website, Prey gets a release date, and what is the Wii hiding under that little flap?
32189	36810	Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
36910	41111	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gamer news.
41775	43176	and Gamer Culture as well.
67153	68234	Hi, there you go.
68274	69134	Hi, now we can hear you.
69395	71356	What are you looking at over there on the laptop?
71376	77500	You've been staring intently there for like... I'm trying to confirm something.
77660	79001	Oh, one of the stories we're doing tonight?
79222	80502	Yes, it's quite important.
80603	81343	Alright, sounds good.
82104	85946	Anyways, we are a bit of a special episode this week.
86006	88828	There is only going to be one part of this week's episode.
88848	93732	There's not going to be a part A and part B. The reason for that is that we're taping far in advance this week.
93792	96674	It's actually Thursday evening when we're taping this week's show.
97519	100120	Partially because I'm fleeing the country tomorrow.
100160	102360	I'm going to be gone for just under a week.
102821	105561	So we're pre-taping our live show on Thursday night.
105921	106902	We are live.
107102	109522	If anybody is listening to our regular live stream, we are here.
109562	112843	We're in our chat room, which is on a brand new server, might I add.
112863	114244	We're on a brand new chat server.
114344	116524	All the details are over at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.
116884	119485	We've moved from Other Side IRC to Game Surge.
119861	120121	DarkSakura
149119	151740	My gaming week was a lot of Dead or Alive 4.
152580	156541	A lot of it, as in that's all everybody played when I got home from work yesterday.
157862	166884	My husband's cousin and his girlfriend were over, and then other people showed up, and so it was pinball slash Dead or Alive Fest all in our house.
167224	173266	And I tried to play a little Warcraft, and I'm going to probably start on whatever server that is that you're on.
175767	176187	I'll say it.
176227	177067	It's my airy peak.
177551	179232	I played Animal Crossing during a meeting at work
204967	206528	Must not have been a very important meeting.
206548	212431	No, it was basically, just to give a little overview, the company I work for was purchased by another company.
213372	213892	Yeah, fun.
214052	220776	And they want to keep us, they want to keep everybody, it was good, but they're all like, they just announced it like the day before, and we're having this big HR meeting and crap.
221236	225419	So me and Julie... Where was everybody doing the panicky, oh my god, Zoraga and Pink Slips?
225439	231162	They're asking stupid questions that we all knew, they were reading off of the same stuff that was on the website at work.
232029	234070	and then, oh, we can't answer that at this time.
234490	236170	Oh, we don't know the answer to this at this time.
236490	239671	Oh, I'm sure information will be available as, you know, that type of crap.
240111	249734	So me and customme19 and another one of our co-worker friends were sitting in the back and our friend was reading a book and we were playing Animal Crossing.
251355	252775	We were sitting on the floor behind people.
252815	253775	You guys are going to get fired.
254335	254595	No.
255476	257116	She's been there longer than I have.
257196	257516	Alright.
258056	259797	She actually trained me at my job.
262161	266082	I want to ask why all the dead are alive for?
267023	269303	Because it was on when I came home.
269383	270023	It was on!
270244	270764	It's on!
273604	275165	Bouncy boobs, it's what's on the tube.
275605	278166	Jeff's girlfriend though, she's really good at the game.
279726	282707	Dan's best friend Eric, she was completely kicking his ass and he's such a masher.
283720	286142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
303820	305821	You could totally get away with button mashing on him.
305841	310702	However, if you knew his moves without mashing, then it was even better.
311562	313343	But yeah, he's the mashers character.
314263	315183	What was it in Tekken 4?
315223	315783	It was a girl?
316383	318204	It was Christy.
318484	321165	It was like his student or some crap.
322285	323585	I play with Huarong anyway.
324466	325686	You can also mash with him too.
326306	327306	A little bit.
327326	329167	But mine was always Jin and Julia.
329927	331808	I'll never forget old school button mashing.
333952	336293	When I used to play Street Fighter 2 back in the day.
336353	336833	Playing Honda?
336873	338433	Yes, eHonda, exactly.
338973	340354	Wow, that's crazy, yes.
340574	342735	Because all you had to do was hit the buttons a bunch.
342775	343955	You did that hand thing.
343975	346055	How would she move?
346295	348476	Though he also had the charging stuff too.
348556	348836	Oh yeah.
348936	351637	It's the same deal with Blanka, just electrocute, electrocute, electrocute.
353017	354298	Chun-Li did the feet thing too.
354478	354858	Yeah.
355698	357419	The old days of cheese.
357459	358819	Did I ever tell you about the time...
359855	360295	Storytime with Rob
382744	391310	I played that game, and I wasn't a huge Street Fighter player, but I was on that game, and I was kicking all these guys' asses with Chun-Li for like an hour straight.
391770	397033	And then finally, some girl came up and also used Chun-Li and worked me.
397333	399275	I mean, she owned me.
400075	403417	I'll never forget her, although, well, I don't remember her name, but, you know.
404418	410242	My days of massive pwnage on fighting games, I have three major milestones.
410522	410762	Okay.
411081	412443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
431147	433429	And then it was me and my friend Marcy.
433469	434890	We were like the killer instinct people.
434930	437032	We would trade off and just like own guys all day.
437372	439293	And then I've told the story many times.
439714	444697	My Tekken 3 escapade at Cyber Station in Mobile, Alabama at Bel Air Mall.
445238	445478	Oh, yeah.
446368	447009	I got in there.
447029	448450	Yeah, you've told this on the show before, I think.
448470	450873	Yeah, these guys have been in there playing from like 10 a.m.
451053	455378	to 2 in the afternoon, doing nothing but King, playing his throws over and over.
455839	457140	So I was like, I want to play.
457240	463367	So I shoved one of them off the machine and played Julia and kept beating them because she has the combo block, the throw blocks.
464520	481948	Killer Instinct, my god, I haven't played that game in forever I really want to play that game, like right now And then Killer Instinct 2 came out when I lived in the dorms So we would go over to the bar, it was like a bar deli arcade And we'd just play Killer Instinct 2 all night What was the name of the skeleton guy?
481968	493573	Because that was the guy I always used I know, sad I don't remember the name I know who you mean, Spinal Yes, Spinal I'll never forget that Combo Breaker
495869	496149	Yeah.
496849	497149	All right.
498390	499911	Loki, how was your gaming week?
500871	501571	It was okay.
501911	504973	I played a little bit more of Blazing Angels.
504993	506874	I'm almost finished with that game now, finally.
507174	511236	It's funny, though, because all the achievements kind of get unlocked at the same time.
511796	515318	Like, you get an achievement for if you ace all the missions, you get something.
515738	519900	Then as you finish the game, I think your rank ends up being, like,
520950	522511	Corporal, or whatever it needs to be.
523131	523992	And then all the medals.
524052	531637	So if you ace all the missions, you unlock like four achievements at the same time, which is most of the achievements in the game anyways.
533919	535520	So yeah, I'm trying to beat this game for achievements.
535960	536761	That's pretty much it.
536981	537801	Points, whore!
538122	544426	And then I've been playing the Chromehounds demo, and that was pretty fun.
544526	546067	I thought that wasn't released in the US.
547088	549630	Wait, you have an account somewhere else, don't you?
549990	550230	Maybe.
550250	550350	Maybe.
551485	552225	It's okay.
552285	554386	I mean, everybody knows you can get an account in another country.
554486	555907	I just set up an account for Japan.
556627	558508	Once you download, you can play it with any account.
559048	559488	That's cool.
560108	562129	It's all in English anyways.
562229	564490	Isn't there a 99 Nights demo in Japan?
564650	564870	No.
565230	565750	I thought there was.
565770	566750	There's Love Football.
567431	568431	That's about it.
568711	570072	That's the only other demo that we don't have.
571803	574104	But still, though, I mean, it's all in English.
574264	575024	I mean, completely.
576885	581647	You can select different languages, I guess, initially or whatever, but it's all in English.
581987	585068	So I don't understand why they didn't release it over here.
585828	587229	It's stupid, but whatever.
587489	588149	You can still get it.
588269	595472	You know, on Major Nelson's blog earlier this week, he talked about why, or there's like an FAQ, why don't things come to certain regions?
595552	600714	And it's always like licensing, permission, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.
600894	602315	It's the internet.
602535	603535	It doesn't matter.
603575	605256	They're downloading it now for your servers.
605456	607097	Obviously, people are getting it anyway, so it doesn't matter.
607117	607477	Yeah, exactly.
607617	608137	What's it matter?
608398	611239	Now, a lot of the feedback I read on the demo was really negative, but you enjoyed it?
611259	613360	That's because they're stupid and they don't understand.
613400	616541	They think that these mechs represent all the mechs in the game.
616861	617522	They're slow.
617582	619903	The mechs are heavy mechs that move slow.
619923	622684	Well, it's not like Speed Racer mechs.
622904	623885	The mechs are slow by...
624745	647653	you can make lighter mechs that are faster or you have these heavier mechs which are damn slow and that's the two missions there's a sniping mission and like a soldier mission and they're both with heavy mechs and they're like these mechs move so slow it's gonna be 15 seconds to turn around yeah it's a heavy mech it's supposed to move slow because it's armored as hell you can get a light mech or a mech with like you know hovercraft bottom or wheels or whatever and it moves fast
648206	650447	Tonight's story time on Orange Launch Radio, but I don't give a shit.
650908	653409	Did you ever play at Dave & Buster's, the mech game they have there?
653870	659513	I played it back when it was at BattleTech in Virtual World.
659873	661874	I played it when it was over at American Life.
661995	664676	Those things were really slow, but it was fun.
665096	665537	Exactly.
665797	667958	I mean, because, you know... I beg to differ.
668499	669599	I got motion sick.
669619	672101	Yeah, but you get motion sick, and that's a whole other Oprah.
672161	672621	But, you know...
674242	678147	If you didn't have that, wouldn't you agree that the game is somewhat fun, at least?
678628	679188	Somewhat.
679328	679929	Okay, there you go.
681071	681311	Anyway.
682632	684294	So yeah, it's a fun game.
684314	684915	I liked it.
684995	686317	And the multiplayer is going to be awesome.
686357	688399	They've got the online...
690624	691224	Thanks for watching!
719864	727748	They're doing a lot of things with this, and this is kind of positioning itself to be like the next, you know, Mecha Assault, you know, game, and that's what kind of people are looking for.
728308	728589	Okay.
730169	730550	Anything else?
731770	732531	Just Grand Theft Auto.
732731	734032	We've been playing more of that still.
734492	744237	Finally, was it Vice City Stories has a date now, October 18th, which is about when the last one came out, so it's not...
745019	754703	I know they're not because they're fucking lazy but they better fix the multiplayer because it's really messed up.
756304	758204	So playable but really messed up.
760585	762426	My gaming week was actually not that exciting.
762486	767388	I did mention during Jamie's gaming week I played World of Warcraft and I did do an instance this week.
768309	774431	Horde's first instance is always the Ragefire Chasm and so I did that instance this week and that's fun.
774952	776513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
794022	794202	Burnout
810871	813692	and I'm finding it's kind of hard to get the achievements in Burnout.
813793	824418	I am having a hard time getting perfects on a lot of those early races, but I find that what you can do is you play a ways and you get the really nice cars and then you go back to the first levels and use the nice cars to beat them.
825239	825399	Yes?
825539	827139	I forgot one more part of my week, actually.
827220	828580	Go for it, because I don't have anything else.
828880	829061	What?
829161	829441	What's that?
829741	831722	I was going to actually bring it and play it on my laptop.
831862	837205	I've got a game, an advanced copy to review.
837225	837585	Mm-hmm.
837978	840279	I'm going to be doing a review on Dragon's Lair HD.
841439	846000	It will be on the stuff.orangenounsradio.com blog.
846740	852662	So everybody should keep their eyes on our board for when I post.
853662	854022	Awesome.
854362	856043	You were talking about that on last week's show, I know.
856523	857383	Yeah, it arrived.
858278	859659	I'm looking forward to checking that out.
859779	860980	The box is very nice.
861060	863061	Are you going to let me play with your copy?
863221	863822	Of course!
863902	864262	Yay!
864482	869946	But I was planning on trying to hook up my laptop to our widescreen TV and see how it looked on that.
870927	871187	I see.
872748	873428	Dragon's Lair.
874549	876831	Alright, well, let's get into the news.
876911	878632	Who wants to start us off tonight with some news?
880033	881514	You know, I think that I could do that.
881794	882114	Alright.
882254	883475	I'd have to try really hard, though.
884886	892091	Well, guess what has officially launched other than a few ships going out to sea?
892951	893312	No idea.
893972	895253	The official PS3 site.
896408	922926	actually both US and UK I haven't bothered checking every other country I assume that it's come out for the US though it is www.us.playstation.com.ps3 for UK it's actually I guess it's eu.playstation.com.ps3 and it's got all the beginning stuff on it any new information at all?
924645	925526	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
955106	956326	It looks just really cool.
956766	959047	Ours is sort of, look, it's a PlayStation 3.
959087	964088	Theirs is like sleek black stuff with flash animation and reflection.
964828	965828	It's so awesome.
966108	967168	Ah, I can't stand it.
967228	967868	Like a hot dog.
969389	969609	What?
971709	972409	Eddie is a joke.
972789	975710	Oh, I was like, PlayStation 3, can't stand it.
976210	976810	Like a hot dog.
978230	978570	But yeah.
979530	981571	Sorry, I'm still looking at stuff.
981591	981911	But anyways.
984068	986089	I'm going to have to mess everything up.
986150	989952	Speaking of the PlayStation, this is more kind of on the PSP, though.
990332	997457	They're saying that they're going to be able to support up to 7,000 PlayStation 1 games with the new emulator, which pretty much is every game out there.
997778	999179	I'm like, there were 7,000 PlayStation games?
999199	1000420	There were not 7,000 games.
1000460	1003702	There were 7,000 different versions of games, so...
1004229	1007451	Basically, that's their way of saying they're going to be able to support every single game.
1007471	1010392	A few holes in that whole statement there.
1010412	1011173	You know what that sounds like?
1011193	1019897	You remember those old 64-in-1 cartridges that were on the NES, and like 20 of them were just Contra with different color players?
1020097	1021098	All kinds of different hacks.
1021138	1022999	That's what this sounds like to me when they say 7,000.
1023919	1026601	Although I personally own a few hundred myself.
1026721	1027221	Yeah, but still, 7,000?
1027381	1027761	I think it's...
1029602	1033527	I think that's what the UK PSP magazine is reporting.
1033967	1037892	But I would say more around all the games that were on the system.
1038193	1039614	Here's my only thing about that though.
1040095	1044981	The PSP does not have a second analog stick and the PSP only has one L and one R button.
1045321	1048185	Yeah, but the very first PS1 controller didn't have an analog stick at all.
1048785	1049026	Yes.
1049488	1057970	True, but if it's going to be supporting all the games, there are games that require the analog stick, and a lot of those games do use the L1 and L2 buttons.
1059011	1062452	So, that eliminates a lot of that 7,000 there.
1063232	1066093	Dumbasses freaking promising the world.
1066293	1069934	But, they do have a good selection of stuff that they are promising.
1070214	1072254	These are going to be available when they launch.
1072334	1078236	Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, Silent Hill, and Tomb Raider.
1078996	1083419	I don't really want to see another Tomb Raider since they were doing the remake anyways, and Tomb Raider sucks.
1084199	1086400	Well, you know, it was a groundbreaking PlayStation game.
1086420	1088141	Tomb Raider Legends is actually fairly decent.
1089062	1089882	That's the new one, right?
1090142	1091263	I didn't like it at all.
1091543	1093124	I didn't like Tomb Raider.
1093504	1096226	I did like breaking her, you know, by throwing her off the cliff.
1096246	1104270	No, that was all about Tomb Raider 2, where you can make her explode, lock the butler in the walk-in freezer, and then make her jump off the balcony where she breaks her neck.
1104610	1105651	The sound was fantastic.
1107731	1109072	Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best.
1109572	1112214	Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best.
1135288	1139109	Well, they like pushing the digital distribution thing, so why not?
1139649	1141050	All right.
1141170	1143470	Hooray for Castlevania Symphony of the Night being on that list.
1143550	1146071	Probably the best PlayStation game, in my opinion, period.
1146491	1147391	The best PlayStation game.
1148471	1149592	Boo for no Intelligent Cube.
1150832	1151572	Well, these are only five.
1151592	1152132	They can go to hell.
1154893	1155553	Hey, maybe one of the 7,000.
1155793	1159854	What we need is freaking Einhound.
1160314	1162215	How come Ridge Racer wasn't on that list?
1163297	1167419	I thought that was the big thing that they were touting at E3 was Ridge Racer.
1168380	1169560	Well, that's just a given.
1169580	1178305	All right, well, anyway, I have to mention, speaking of Ridge Racer, there is a brand new Ridge Racer title coming to the PSP.
1178385	1179205	It's Rid Racer 2.
1179365	1179866	Rid Racer.
1179906	1180166	Racer 2.
1186519	1187539	Can I edit that out?
1188180	1193902	Ridge Racer 2 in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.
1196864	1201786	It's going to start off with the last game left off.
1202146	1209129	It will have a return of the Nitro system as well as all the drift-based racing that makes Ridge Racer what it is.
1214389	1214869	You know what it is?
1214969	1217650	If I don't say it, Ridge Racer, then I can't say it at all.
1217770	1218490	That's the problem now.
1218510	1223051	The thing about Ridge Racer, each game's been exactly the same as the last one.
1223172	1224772	No, no, no, no, no, it has not.
1225392	1227453	Okay, so it's R4.
1227733	1228993	R4 was the best of them.
1229053	1229813	You didn't let me finish.
1230354	1231614	There are new modes.
1232495	1234656	as opposed to Ridge Racer 1 on the PSP.
1234996	1244598	There is, of course, the returning World Tours, Time Attack, Wireless, but now there is Arcade, Duel, and Survival Mode.
1244959	1252101	And Arcade Mode is kind of like an arcade racing game where you try to get to a goal in a certain amount of time and then you get more time as you get to each checkpoint.
1252641	1253901	Survival is where you play chicken.
1255982	1256582	That would be fun.
1256862	1260403	That would be like Twisted Metal Ridge Racer.
1262003	1269790	All right, so anyway, rumor is the game is 70% complete, and the Japanese release should be September 14th.
1270551	1272053	Yes.
1272413	1284264	Speaking of Ridge Racer and Sony, Sony is actually claiming that Microsoft is copying them, that they are completely cloning the PlayStation 3 with the Xbox 360.
1286484	1289225	Now, I'm not sure where in that argument that makes sense.
1289445	1296408	Okay, seeing as the PlayStation 3 is not even out yet, I'm not sure what this is all... I mean, is it the camera and the eye toy thing?
1296628	1300109	No, this was an interview that was done in the official PlayStation magazine.
1300649	1300970	Oh.
1301510	1302930	That won't be biased at all, I'm sure.
1303370	1304371	Which, yeah, okay.
1305470	1309472	And it says, brings up how everyone is comparing Microsoft to Sony.
1309512	1316656	And the Sony rep claims as soon as they do something, they see Microsoft trailing behind them, following their strategies.
1318097	1319678	Huh, that's kind of funny.
1320918	1322419	I will give them credit on one thing.
1322980	1323560	One thing only.
1324180	1327002	The fact that they have dual analog sticks on the controller.
1327942	1329503	And that's about it.
1330063	1334906	Because, that's, you know, I think that was the first system, the PlayStation, to do that.
1336152	1336773	But that's about it.
1336893	1337973	That's all I'm giving them.
1338514	1342956	Well, the DualShock controller is easily one of the top three controllers of all time, you know.
1343737	1350961	But in turn, wasn't the DualShock controller just a grown-up version of the Super Nintendo controller in a way?
1351201	1353883	This was Kaz Hirai's...
1356345	1384552	I guess and another quote that was taken from the interview here and the other thing is you look you take a look at for example the fact that we incorporate the blu-ray drive from day one you're not going to be asking me so talk to me about this blu-ray add-on that you have does it work for games is it just for movies that's exactly the kind of pitfall you fall into if you launch something that's too early to premature no
1385100	1386581	You're launching a year late.
1387742	1388603	Gag order, Sony.
1388743	1390524	I've said it before on this program.
1390764	1392705	Everybody needs to stop talking right now.
1393106	1396108	It's working for Nintendo.
1396408	1398650	Some of them talk, but they don't talk as much as you do.
1398830	1400211	Let me put it this way.
1401492	1403453	They're copying a lot of people.
1403933	1408957	You've got to admit, the whole live thing... Granted, it's a great business model.
1409057	1410778	They can't say they're completely original.
1411339	1413140	They're copying the business model, basically.
1413780	1414581	Trying to make it their own...
1414929	1416710	But that's fine, okay?
1416730	1422053	Because it's something that needs to be done, just like the controllers look kind of the same, they're pretty much the same nowadays.
1423474	1427997	That's fine, but don't go and claim that you're the one that created it when your system's not even out there yet.
1428617	1438443	Hell, we don't even know what their online marketplace is like, and to say that, oh, well, Microsoft ripped us off, well, that's kind of impossible to do if you don't, you know, you can't rip off the future.
1439603	1442425	Wasn't there some rumor going around this week, and I apologize if I'm
1443007	1445988	Spoiling somebody else's story for later in the show, but I don't remember this coming up.
1446388	1453451	But I seem to recall something about the Xbox 360 had hinted that they wanted to add something to their controller.
1454232	1460214	Like there's some type of... It was kind of pointing like they might do motion sensing in their controller.
1460734	1461735	But I don't see that happening.
1461775	1462835	I don't think I heard that.
1463315	1465676	But no, I think I heard it on another show or something.
1465876	1469518	There's some other stories that we'll have that kind of hints that they're copying...
1470371	1470591	and more.
1486638	1487739	from Kaz Harai.
1488119	1497588	Generally speaking, over the past 12 years or so, there has been a consumer expectation that disc-based games are maybe $59 on the high end to $39 on the low end.
1498068	1504654	So what I can say now is, I think it would be a bit of a stretch to think that we could suddenly turn around and say, PlayStation 3 games now $99.99.
1506767	1509768	I don't think consumers expect software pricing to suddenly double.
1510168	1518371	So the quick answer is that we want to make it as affordable as possible knowing that there is a set consumer expectation for what software has cost the past 12 years.
1518931	1520511	That's kind of the best answer I can give you.
1520991	1524072	So if it becomes a bit higher than $59, don't ding me.
1524392	1525833	But again, I don't expect it to be $100.
1525873	1526133	So you mean...
1531266	1533666	Here's the thing, and I don't want to sound like a broken record.
1533686	1537907	I mean, honestly, I am trying to find the good side of the whole Sony argument here.
1537927	1539488	There's what?
1560103	1560803	No, come on.
1560923	1562344	I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible.
1562364	1565725	This is why people say we're anti-Sony, Jamie.
1566065	1568245	Listen, I owned a Sony PlayStation.
1568285	1569085	I owned a PlayStation 2.
1569486	1570866	I said, fuck Xbox.
1570926	1571946	I'm not buying an Xbox.
1571966	1572566	I did too.
1572866	1574067	I was right there with you.
1574167	1577228	I said, fuck Xbox when it first came out.
1577608	1588031	And even still, when the PlayStation 3, when they were talking about it originally, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to own a PlayStation 3 and an Xbox 360 because I love the PlayStation 3 games and stuff, and it sounds cool.
1589111	1589251	But
1590060	1592162	And then the E3, it was like, you lost me.
1592663	1594124	It's like Crazy World over there.
1594364	1598088	And the thing is... I think the expectations were met perfectly.
1598308	1604635	They're trying to basically say, our games, you have to understand, you're paying for HD games, you're paying for...
1605100	1607381	Games that have higher development costs.
1607401	1610983	You're paying for media that's $20 for blanks or whatever.
1611444	1613445	This is why the games are more expensive.
1613705	1614926	You're going to have to pay for this.
1614966	1621049	But the thing is, when people are developing games on both platforms, and it's even been said before, you can't tell the difference between them.
1621109	1621850	So why the hell?
1621930	1630835	And this is also, Microsoft is doing the same thing with the Xbox and Xbox 360 games, especially at launch, that were only slightly different, OK?
1631841	1639231	Why should I pay more money for a game that looks exactly the same and probably plays exactly the same on a system that's even more expensive?
1639811	1641614	People aren't, and you know what?
1641674	1643076	That's going to be a problem for them.
1644534	1647855	I don't know, that argument seems a little Nintendo fanboy-ish to me for some reason.
1648056	1651757	Like, you know, the way you phrase that makes it sound like you're all about the Wii in that way.
1652157	1654598	Which is okay, I mean, you're into whatever you're into.
1654738	1663082	I'm just saying if they are going to be pushing a system that this is, you know, the games are $79, I better see a vast improvement between that and the 360 version.
1663102	1665303	Those games better do my fucking dishes if they're going to be $80.
1665343	1665603	That's insane.
1668457	1674702	At least 360 has $5 games on their marketplace that kick butt.
1675443	1680167	I want to see stuff that they were showing in those E3 videos or whatever.
1681207	1683649	Or the Game Developer Conference videos.
1683850	1690775	I want my next Jak and Daxter game or Ratchet and Clank to look like a goddamn movie.
1691035	1693918	That's what I want to see if it's going to be this expensive.
1693938	1696800	Sigh.
1698675	1698975	I don't know.
1699295	1699575	All right.
1700256	1700596	We'll see.
1700656	1706819	I mean, we don't know until about a month before or maybe two months before when the actual pricing is announced.
1706839	1707359	But I'll tell you what.
1707659	1714642	You know, if that's their argument is that, oh, well, we have to price it this way because we're taking full advantage of the HD, da-da-da-da-da.
1714962	1721305	Okay, you're taking full advantage of the HD, but how much of the marketplace is ready to take full advantage of the HD?
1722425	1723426	Not a lot this year.
1724589	1730873	Maybe this time next year even, or the year after, because with each Christmas, the price of the HDTVs are going to get lower and lower.
1731393	1732654	Maybe we'll be ready to talk.
1732814	1737277	But honestly, it's not like HD... I mean, I am an HDTV owner.
1737397	1739298	I love it, and I would highly recommend it to everybody.
1739719	1745702	But looking at even just regular television, there's not a lot of embracing of HDTV yet.
1745942	1749144	There's not a whole lot of incentive to go to HDTV right now.
1749164	1750966	And if you're going with the Sony concept here...
1752646	1756648	Your HDTV would not be good enough because it does not display 1080p.
1757628	1759409	Well, I don't know.
1759769	1760169	It might.
1760329	1761229	It has HDMI.
1761690	1762490	I don't know.
1762530	1764031	Not every TV is going to be able to.
1764131	1767092	It'll actually say, usually in your manual that comes with your TV.
1767152	1768833	Well, then Sony can suck it.
1769453	1769993	Thank you.
1771013	1771594	Hooray for that.
1772634	1774055	I know I'll buy one anyway.
1774295	1775195	I have to have one.
1775335	1777256	I have to play Final Fantasy XIII.
1777336	1778176	I'm that sad.
1778696	1779877	I will buy the damn machine.
1780774	1783678	But I'll probably bitch about it if I'm not satisfied, you know?
1783938	1785420	And like, you're going to buy one too.
1785940	1789184	You're sitting here all anti-Sony, I hate Sony, but you're going to buy one too.
1789204	1791527	However, I was anti-Xbox and I bought one.
1791547	1793349	Okay, listen.
1793950	1796533	I buy everything new that comes out.
1796693	1797654	You probably buy a fucking 3D.
1797674	1798755	I have a GameCom.
1798996	1799837	Okay, I understand.
1800177	1801658	I have a virtual employee.
1801698	1802578	That's the same thing.
1802678	1804119	I have to own it all.
1804639	1805639	I'm like Veruca Salt.
1805959	1806700	Mine, mine, mine.
1806740	1807220	Me, me, me.
1807260	1808120	I want it all.
1808380	1808760	Exactly.
1808780	1809461	Here's the thing though.
1809681	1810821	I'm not getting it at launch.
1811601	1813162	I am not getting it at launch.
1813202	1815043	I didn't get 360 at launch and I turned out okay.
1815123	1815863	Yeah, exactly.
1816043	1819244	And I'm just saying just based on what games are coming out right now.
1820505	1820905	Okay.
1822286	1825547	I really hate to bring this story to light because it's just...
1826590	1831913	It really, you gotta wonder what crazy ass people they got working at Sony.
1831993	1837936	I'm sorry, this news came from a website called Gamefront.de.
1838336	1845399	It's a German site that has a lot of information on Sony PlayStation and the Wii and all that stuff.
1846820	1854724	They noticed, and I was looking for it right before the show, that Sony has registered a patent in the Japanese patent office
1855526	1855666	Poo's
1883197	1887419	They're saying that the circles might actually represent the analog 6.
1887999	1896403	So what you have here is them copying the Wii in the name of, but the controller is called... It's a PlayStation.
1896443	1897204	I get PS.
1897304	1898484	It makes sense.
1899185	1903907	I understand, you know, with the little circles, I guess that could be kind of... The Poos?
1905388	1905788	The Poos?
1905808	1906408	The Poocon!
1906528	1907088	And the Wii?
1907449	1907929	Poocon!
1907969	1908869	The Pooh and the Wii?
1909069	1911531	What's the Xbox 360 going to come out with?
1911591	1912151	The Sphincter!
1912171	1912531	The Sphincter!
1914872	1915252	Who's?
1915952	1917793	What the hell are they thinking?
1917853	1919234	Okay, show me the logo.
1919754	1920614	Okay.
1920634	1921615	You said you had a picture of it, right?
1921655	1929278	I have a picture of the logo, and I will show it to you, and I will actually probably post this in our forum just so everyone can look at it.
1929818	1930038	Okay.
1932459	1933620	Convince me this isn't fake.
1934913	1941556	Honestly, because I look at this and I go, this is some anti-Sony person's idea of a really bad joke.
1942457	1943517	I looked at the website.
1943658	1944298	I couldn't see.
1944338	1950621	The only thing I couldn't look up the patent, or not the patent, the trademark on there, because I have no idea how to look up those trademarks on that website.
1950641	1952482	You can't search by company or anything like that.
1952762	1954043	You have to know the trademark number.
1954503	1958465	Well, I looked at their screenshot, and it looks like off that website.
1958525	1961707	So granted, it could be an elaborate hoax or something like that.
1962287	1962867	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1987384	1990285	Remember the morning that the Wii was announced?
1990565	1993966	Like, Nintendo fanboys were like, oh, that's not right.
1994006	1994606	That's a lie.
1994706	1995627	It's not called the Wii.
1995687	1997227	Stop fucking with us, Sony fanboys.
1997587	1998988	I'm like having one of those moments.
1999048	2002109	I'm like, seriously, you can't be calling this the poos.
2004089	2006350	You have to realize what you're doing here.
2008250	2009771	But see, that logo is too...
2010894	2013016	I don't know, it's too simplistic to me.
2014077	2014978	It screams fake.
2015438	2016239	I don't think I'd buy it.
2016339	2016900	I really don't.
2017040	2019022	Well, I'm just going by what it looks like here.
2019062	2021744	It doesn't look so much like an Infinity, but it looks like an 8.
2023426	2026008	No, seriously, because the left side is smaller than the right.
2026729	2033034	Well, I think what that might mean or whatever is, I don't know, have something to do with the tilting of it or something.
2033054	2033595	I don't know.
2035582	2062235	if they were showing it tilted it would have been at a completely different ratio I don't know what they're thinking but anyways I still call bullshit I don't think they're dumb enough to name their console the poos I'm looking and you know what I'll try to find this and I seriously think just looking at the screenshot that is a shot straight off that website I know just from browsing the website it looks exactly like it so you know what it could be a hoax but if
2062600	2063040	It's not.
2063220	2065762	It should be in there somewhere, and we should be able to find it.
2065922	2072927	So, either way, you're going to find out pretty soon, and if it is, that's really weird.
2073727	2074328	It's really weird.
2074628	2075048	We'll see.
2075108	2075388	I don't know.
2075408	2077169	I'm taking that with a huge grain of salt.
2077390	2086075	But if that turns out to be the real name, if we're back here next week with some type of confirmation stuff, I'm just going to shed more tears for Sony, because the poos.
2086936	2088837	I mean, I realize, okay, it's an infinity sign.
2088877	2091559	It's not OO, but you're saying that's how they've trademarked it, right?
2091579	2091959	Yeah.
2093050	2097194	That's P space O-O space S is what it's on.
2097254	2100957	And that doesn't sound a little anti-Sony fanboy to you?
2101937	2103218	That doesn't sound... I don't know.
2103319	2103959	Well, it didn't.
2104079	2115248	The whole story from them, and I don't have it translated, unfortunately, it was just saying that they had registered a patent for the controller, or a trademark for the controller, and...
2116826	2121209	It says that they speculate, okay, the PNNS, of course, is PlayStation.
2121229	2124192	The two circles are the analog sticks.
2124252	2128395	They didn't draw the distinction that it's naughty, you know, poo, you know.
2128555	2129556	They didn't laugh about it.
2129616	2131998	They just, like, basically reported it as a story.
2132358	2132758	And that's it.
2132778	2134900	And it had a picture of the logo on there.
2135448	2138909	Our few chatters that are here today want to see the article for themselves.
2139049	2141050	So link it in the chat room so you can see it.
2141110	2150892	Gamefront.de And if you scroll down quite a bit, there's a story about the Eye of Judgment right below it.
2150992	2152913	Speaking of poo.
2156114	2157334	That's not just poo.
2157374	2159475	That's like the poo of poo.
2159555	2163816	Silly console names make us crazy and cause us to get a little angsty.
2164381	2169805	and that makes us want to get really, really angsty and do our FUs of the week.
2170666	2172727	How's that sound, DarkSakura?
2182835	2185557	My FU of the week is actually not what it was going to originally be.
2185697	2192983	It's actually toward my work for having these stupid, retarded meetings for two hours about crap they don't know.
2194660	2196340	Oh, what about our pension?
2196661	2197621	We don't know that yet.
2198341	2199861	Oh, what about our thing?
2200141	2201102	We don't know that either.
2201842	2202862	Oh, but what about this?
2203082	2206503	Let me read directly off of our website that's been posted for the last three days.
2208123	2208784	Ugh, people.
2210344	2211824	There's two words for that meaning.
2212264	2214005	Premature and pathetic.
2214645	2215925	There was no call for it.
2216225	2218366	I mean, it's basically, I think, just to smooth things over.
2218666	2221187	But really, all it did was, like, just piss people off.
2221287	2222787	So, a big...
2223328	2225729	F you to that stupid meeting, how pointless it was.
2226349	2229530	You know, give us a meeting when we actually have some information on it.
2230110	2233310	So, yeah, the end.
2235351	2244633	My F you is going to Sony because every day I read something crazy and crazier from them and it's such a disappointment.
2247674	2248194	Well, that was quick.
2249216	2253920	My FU of the week goes to myself because I'm leaving the country tomorrow and I haven't even started packing.
2254220	2254781	Go me!
2255461	2255882	I rock.
2256382	2259945	I did get a lot of laundry done though, so I'll at least smell clean when I go to Canada.
2261146	2262788	Because I hear they check for that at the border.
2264489	2266051	Does Skye smell laundry fresh?
2266831	2267192	We'll see.
2268593	2270334	Moving on... Oh, that was you?
2270975	2271095	Um...
2273928	2278570	There actually is a little bit of release news for our dear friends in the UK.
2279891	2287755	Take-Two's game Prey has been announced to be released on July 14th, which is actually three days after we're going to get it here.
2287875	2300881	There's also going to be a limited edition version for the PC, and there's a thing likely that there's going to be a demo for the Xbox 360 showing up on live pretty quick.
2302152	2306074	That's another one of those things everybody's on Major Nelson's blog going, where's our Prey demo?
2306114	2306874	Where's the demo?
2307234	2308435	Where's Street Fighter?
2308475	2319019	Basically, for anyone who doesn't know, Prey is, you're playing as a garage mechanic who gets kidnapped by aliens and has to save the world with his dead grandfather to guide him.
2320960	2321900	Yeah, isn't that fantastic?
2322020	2323401	That really makes me want to play Prey.
2324161	2325182	I want to check it out.
2326042	2327863	I want to play that game so that I can throw up.
2328880	2330761	Oh, because of motion sickness and all that?
2330861	2332182	I don't really care for first-person shooters.
2332202	2335443	I haven't liked a first-person shooter since Hexen, really.
2336484	2340866	I haven't played one a lot since Halo 2, probably, but I'll give it a shot.
2341686	2342547	I mean, I'll watch it.
2342627	2343928	It's got a lot of hype.
2343968	2345108	There's got to be something about it.
2345268	2352472	I actually could sit through Perfect Dark Zero without getting sick for a little while.
2352712	2354673	See, I tried to get into that and I just couldn't.
2355828	2359151	I'm personally not too excited about Prey, however, I know some of our listeners are.
2359231	2360412	So, hey, guess what?
2360452	2360972	Prey's coming out.
2361553	2361893	Sweet.
2364154	2365976	Yes, that game looks actually pretty cool.
2367051	2369112	It's going to have really awesome multiplayer, apparently.
2370592	2377415	Speaking of multiplayer, actually, Oblivion's got another mod for the PC, and that's a multiplayer mod.
2377875	2385018	It's kind of in alpha right now, but it allows you right now to basically exist in the same world with somebody else.
2385619	2392941	But they're hoping that later on they're going to be able to add support up to eight players along with deathmatch and capture the flag.
2393942	2395342	So, it's kind of nifty.
2395362	2396543	Wait, Oblivion?
2397705	2399346	Multiplayer Capture the Flag.
2400666	2401486	That's kind of weird.
2402207	2403087	That's crazy though.
2403107	2405188	Somebody built multiplayer into Oblivion?
2405408	2405648	Yeah.
2407148	2416612	You would think that they would want to put that in the game themselves and charge five bucks for it on Xbox 360 next to the horsey armor and all that stuff.
2417252	2417732	Yeah.
2417972	2419193	If they were even to do that.
2419833	2420033	I don't...
2421234	2422254	That's a weird add-on.
2422574	2426215	I mean, it sounds great, but that seems like it would change the game significantly.
2426335	2431416	I think it would be pretty cool to go, not even if you can't do Deathmatch, but do co-op.
2432036	2433316	Co-op would be pretty cool.
2433756	2438157	I mean, that's like a whole other idea for an Oblivion game, honestly.
2438177	2446599	That's crazy that somebody built that into... That takes some real talent and skill and sleepless nights and coffee to be able to do.
2446619	2447559	Wow.
2447839	2448119	Yeah.
2448619	2448719	Um...
2449608	2457013	Speaking of Oblivion, kind of an exclusive here, another wonderful item appeared in my system at work.
2457694	2459275	That would be Oblivion on the PS3.
2459295	2462797	It's going to be coming out currently at launch.
2464178	2467801	My guess is probably after launch sometime, but it is coming.
2468301	2470383	Okay, so why haven't we heard until today?
2471030	2471710	Anything about that?
2472230	2472770	I hope I know.
2472970	2474811	People don't watch the retails.
2475051	2485593	They do watch GameSpot and EB, because I noticed my similar stories to the one we talked about on Sunday night have appeared on Monday Tuesday.
2485853	2492774	Yeah, because they saw the box art from GameStop, apparently, which pulled it off their website, too.
2493355	2496015	And funny enough, all those titles I said were correct.
2496215	2498856	So, whoo, heard it here first.
2499056	2499796	Except they didn't get the 100...
2501627	2502048	and so on.
2518880	2524583	Oblivion, of course, is a really big game on Xbox 360, but the biggest game on the regular Xbox was no doubt Halo 2.
2525563	2532607	And when Halo 2 was first released, there was a company, Plantronics, and they created a special edition Halo 2 headset.
2533568	2546094	It cost about $49.95 to $59.95, but the cool thing was that they were donating $1 of the proceeds to the Plantronics Gamecom United Way Katrina Relief Fund.
2546519	2561706	Now, I know that doesn't sound like a whole lot of the cost, but something to note is that the price of those headsets has now dropped to $14.95 to $19.95 for your Xbox Communicator Special Halo 2 Edition.
2561766	2562546	So check that out.
2562766	2567749	And some of it goes to charity so you can feel good about yourself as you go kill people on Halo.
2570710	2574592	Well, killing people is not a good thing to do.
2575635	2576515	Unless they're in your way.
2576835	2577635	No, I'm kidding.
2578696	2590198	However, there are prisoners who are at Wakefield Prison in the UK who have to get rid of their PlayStation 2s.
2590818	2591658	Oh, boo-hoo.
2592098	2594259	Yeah, I mean, being in prison, wow.
2595219	2600500	But basically, there were inmates at this prison who,
2600982	2606526	who were found that they were watching porn on their PlayStation 2s.
2607526	2608086	Yeah.
2609027	2617873	And so they received 200 pounds each for every confiscated machine.
2618573	2618793	Huh.
2619494	2620774	It's like... Oh, so wait, wait, wait.
2621175	2621395	Wait.
2622115	2624256	They took them, but then they paid them for it?
2624697	2624897	Yeah.
2624917	2624997	Yeah.
2626411	2628252	Isn't that great?
2628612	2629213	200 pounds?
2629713	2630554	Yeah, that's a lot of money.
2630814	2632775	I'm like, yeah, that's a lot.
2632795	2634316	Isn't that more than what one costs new?
2634716	2636217	Yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah.
2636597	2639339	Because a pound's worth more than a dollar right now, right?
2639919	2644742	So basically, yeah, for the nine prisoners who had theirs taken away, that's 1,800 pounds, you know.
2644902	2646764	Well, now, did they have all the porn taken away, too?
2646804	2648565	Because maybe that justifies why they were paid so much.
2648585	2651687	Because they probably had some really impressive collections of pornography, I mean.
2651727	2655189	But even so, keep in mind that this is probably coming out of the...
2655954	2656694	Pockets of People.
2656775	2666040	Now, the prison service is saying that they're refunding the prisoners because they bought the PlayStation 2s with their own money.
2668141	2672963	And there's also been a mention that not compensating them might have been a breach of human rights.
2673023	2673544	But you know what?
2673864	2679747	I think that they breached the rights of whoever they violated when needed whatever crime they did to put themselves in jail.
2680467	2681908	You're in jail as punishment.
2682048	2683469	It shouldn't be happy fun time.
2684560	2691144	They should get a brick wall with a toilet attached to it and a piece of board to lay on.
2693285	2694185	Okay, not that bad.
2695086	2698008	But seriously, if you've killed somebody, yeah, you get a cell.
2698568	2700289	Well, who knows what these people were?
2700549	2703050	This is a maximum security case.
2703070	2704931	They could have been drug criminals.
2706412	2709234	They're saying that among those that it was taken from, they were sex offenders.
2710589	2712410	Oh, we're watching porn.
2712430	2712950	That's lovely.
2713010	2713650	Okay, I get it.
2713670	2716550	Yeah, I had absolutely no sympathy for a sex offender.
2717291	2721812	But also, it was quoted by Norman Brennan, who's the chairman of the Victim of Crime Trust.
2722612	2727653	It was quoted in the Yorkshire Post that it made a mockery of the whole criminal justice system.
2729013	2735474	And honestly, I don't know what to think about that.
2735514	2737955	I think it's kind of sad that they had him to begin with.
2739166	2742188	Well, better porn than shower rapes, I mean, honestly.
2743048	2745769	I think if you're in prison for something, it shouldn't be happy fun time.
2746530	2748691	It should be pay your penalty time.
2748771	2756495	Honestly, I'd rather, without getting into a political discussion, I'd rather they take out their sexual frustrations on porno than shower rape.
2757728	2760030	Beat the meat instead of beating each other
2787968	2795756	That'll take place during some show that's going on over there.
2795776	2798559	The Ripspeed Donnie Carr Show.
2800123	2803284	I don't know if that's any big thing that's... Did you say car show?
2803324	2804004	Car show.
2804624	2807665	It's supposed to get in... It's supposed to... It's Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
2807685	2809866	Come on down to the car show and video game tournament.
2810266	2812367	Okay, it's going to be happening... Babes in Halo.
2812567	2828212	It's supposed to be happening on the 13th of August, and if you're curious, you can look it up at www.donnyshow.co.uk That's D-O-N-N-Y show.co.uk And they're expecting to get 20,000 visitors.
2829625	2836011	I don't know if that's big for a car show or not, but it's going to take place at the North Weld Airfield in Essex.
2836291	2851965	So what you can expect there, though, they're going to be having the Xbox Cup, which is a four-and-a-half-hour live broadcast of the Adidas World of Football in Berlin, which is going to be on Saturday, this Saturday, actually.
2853266	2856249	Or, well, by the time you get this podcast, probably yesterday.
2856269	2856349	Okay.
2857677	2860658	So I hope you watched it, or else TiVo'd it.
2861778	2867720	But anyways, for that one that's actually going on during the car show, they're going to be doing Project Gotham 3 tournament.
2867780	2869081	Do they have TiVo in the UK?
2869981	2870301	I don't know.
2870741	2872302	I'm sure they have some type of DVR.
2872702	2878704	They're going to be having a Project Gotham Racing 3 tournament at the car show, which is appropriate since it is a car show.
2880624	2885966	And... Yeah, so basically the Extreme Sports Channel has...
2890407	2898043	And they're bringing together hundreds of UK's very best gamers to compete in the UK's first live televised pro racing games tournament.
2899146	2910551	After seven days of grueling heats on Xbox Live in the morning at Ripspeed Donny, the final 16 competitors will be pitting their racing skills against the very best the UK has to offer.
2911031	2926097	They will be playing Project Gotham Racing 3 on an open-air 20-foot by 15-foot LED screen on live television, and the pressure will be on to give the best performance with a huge audience and a hot list of prizes up for grabs.
2926803	2927203	All three of them?
2927223	2928224	That's what I said, yeah.
2928345	2928425	TV.
2928445	2929606	Oh my god, TiVo's only in the US!
2929626	2929946	Not HD.
2948704	2949805	No, no, I don't mean... Forget it.
2950165	2950485	Forget it.
2951345	2952586	Yeah, they have that pal thing.
2952886	2953547	No.
2953707	2954027	Forget it.
2954207	2964712	It's also going to be rebroadcast, or the four 30-minute live broadcasts are going to be on Sunday, the 13th of August, with the programming repeated between 9 p.m.
2964872	2965653	and 11 p.m.
2965793	2969795	and midnight to 2 a.m., so... Fun, fun.
2970015	2972556	But hey, that's kind of neat, though, especially with the Gotham TV.
2972856	2976958	Gotham TV, if they actually do it right, they can make it look pretty cool, so... I don't know.
2978099	2978379	All right.
2980011	2980632	Saint Seiya's Coming to Europe
3002168	3004189	Saint Seiya is a freaking old-ass anime.
3004209	3005650	I don't know why it's taking this long.
3006010	3013154	But Atari and Namco Bandai are bringing out Saint Seiya the Hades to Europe later on in the year.
3013414	3015735	It's based off the manga and anime.
3016536	3020518	Over here it was called Night to the Zodiac or some stupid crap.
3020758	3021959	No, they had Saint Seiya over here.
3023059	3023259	Hmm?
3023439	3024800	They had Saint Seiya over here.
3025280	3027422	I thought it came out over here as Night to the Zodiac.
3027442	3028242	No, they had it.
3029221	3035622	Anyway, but basically it's supposed to be full-on anime style.
3035642	3037382	You have the Cosmo system pulled in.
3038203	3040243	It's supposed to be out in autumn.
3043323	3047244	Alright, that's pretty spiffy there.
3047544	3052025	I don't know, the anime games don't seem to do too well, at least I know from a work standpoint.
3052165	3053345	It isn't Dragon Ball anyway.
3054545	3055645	It's always Dragon Ball.
3056006	3056766	Or Yu-Gi-Oh!
3056786	3057246	Does Yu-Gi-Oh!
3057286	3057926	count as anime?
3058286	3058566	I guess so.
3058865	3061627	It's more of a card game than anime, but... Well, Yu-Gi-Oh!
3061707	3062428	Yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh!
3062468	3063248	What did it start as?
3063268	3064970	Did it start as a card game or did it start as anime?
3065130	3066251	It started as a card game, right?
3066291	3067652	No, it started as the card game.
3067712	3073456	Actually, it was another thing before that, like Dual Monsters, and then it was Yu-Gi-Oh!
3073817	3075118	And I actually have Yu-Gi-Oh!
3075158	3076579	manga from a Shonen Jump from 1991.
3076639	3077700	Okay, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
3077740	3078260	Put the brakes on.
3078761	3081142	I just realized we're wasting time on this show talking about Yu-Gi-Oh!
3082764	3083985	I have a deck.
3084005	3087327	Okay, so as far as stuff coming out this week...
3089472	3089892	Nothing.
3090413	3093155	I mean, absolutely almost nothing.
3093355	3096097	Oh, and Tuesdays are big release days, right?
3096317	3098858	And Tuesdays are 4th of July, which is a big holiday here.
3098898	3099539	Well, no, not Tuesdays.
3099979	3102461	Usually it's around Wednesdays or so, but whatever, it doesn't matter.
3104042	3109866	Although, if you do have a 360, Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 is going to be coming out, so yippee.
3111803	3115445	And that's about the only good game that's coming out this week, to be honest.
3115465	3119668	There's like, literally on my pre-book sheet that I was ordering for people, four games.
3120448	3120668	Wow.
3120688	3120929	Four.
3121449	3126072	And most of them were, like there was, was it Board Game Classics 20-1?
3126272	3128053	Oh, hooray!
3130775	3137219	Some soccer game that was on the, Sony's official soccer game on the PSP is coming out.
3137579	3140561	Which is funny, because it's still 06, but whatever.
3142405	3144606	That one's coming out, and that's about it.
3144946	3150189	And even the week after that's even... Actually, the week after that's going to be pretty good, because that's when you're going to get Parade and Chromehands and stuff like that.
3153932	3157254	Okay, so, well, we aren't getting crap in the U.S.
3157294	3157694	this week.
3157754	3158255	Is the U.K.
3158295	3158935	faring any better?
3161497	3168401	Well, you know, it would be fantastic if that was actually the case, but not always.
3168421	3168481	Yes.
3169198	3175582	Well, I'll tell you what, there actually are some interesting things going to be out coming up in the first week of July.
3176783	3182306	Although, honestly, I don't see what's too exciting about Alex Rider's Stormbreaker.
3185548	3186809	That sounded pretty exciting.
3187609	3189170	Sorry, my cell phone went off in studio.
3189650	3191652	There's also Earache Extreme Metal Racing.
3193072	3197175	Although, I have to say, on the 7th, they do get Chromehounds.
3197637	3199338	Alex Rider's going to be pretty sweet, though.
3199378	3200439	It's got a DS in that.
3202040	3203560	And they get Electroplankton.
3204821	3207142	And Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow.
3207763	3210925	And Super Dragon Ball Z. And that's about it.
3212325	3213166	And Big Brain Academy.
3216288	3223272	I've heard Big Brain Academy is way better than brain training, but I've only played it myself for like five minutes, so I need more time with it.
3223312	3224552	But it looks like there's a lot more to it.
3224692	3225793	I love Electroplankton.
3227788	3232031	I was playing that demo in line at E3 last year like the whole time.
3233312	3234053	That's pretty cool.
3234493	3236095	I don't know, it sounds like a lot of good stuff.
3236635	3238697	They're actually getting a lot of good games though in July.
3238817	3251046	I mean, just later on, there's coming out with Civ IV, Civ City Rome, Shin Megami Tensei, which I saw some of at E3 Prey.
3252968	3255430	There's actually some pretty decent stuff coming out in July.
3256731	3256911	Cool.
3259492	3271064	Anyways, speaking of stuff coming out, Eevee and GameStop are going to be getting a special edition of Final Fantasy XII, when that finally comes out around Halloween.
3272626	3280414	Included in that, of course, will be a steel bookcase, developers interviews, history of Final Fantasy featurettes,
3281997	3289462	Final Fantasy XII US trailers, Final Fantasy XII Japanese trailers, Final Fantasy XII art galleries as well.
3290663	3292184	Cosplay footage, please.
3294045	3294405	Damn.
3295766	3299809	And you can get that for $59.99 when that comes out.
3300289	3300969	Halloween.
3301730	3302050	All right.
3303123	3305145	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3324042	3328204	So what we want to ask is our voicemail question of the week is, do you pre-order games?
3328624	3332066	If so, what do you believe are the advantages of pre-ordering games?
3332166	3334307	If you don't pre-order games, why don't you do it?
3334667	3335668	We want to hear your feedback.
3335688	3337289	We'll play some of your responses on the air.
3337489	3339570	Give our voicemail a call any time during the week.
3339970	3343191	It's 916-226-9067.
3343512	3348554	Please keep in mind, boys and girls, that that may be a toll call unless you happen to be local to where we are.
3348654	3352675	So please make sure you have the permission of whoever's paying the phone bill before you give that a call.
3352715	3355156	But we want your opinion on pre-ordering games.
3355336	3360098	And are you going to pre-order Final Fantasy XII to get that super special limited edition?
3361059	3361379	I might.
3361459	3368722	I usually don't pre-order games, but I might because I'm that big of a XII whore that I might want to have all that special shit.
3368862	3369302	So we'll see.
3371733	3380001	Anyway, I mentioned earlier in the program that Major Nelson's blog's been pretty active this week and he wrote a pretty lengthy blog earlier this week about...
3381324	3385508	Everybody's been bitching and leaving comments in his blog Where's Street Fighter 2?
3385868	3387249	Where's the demo for Prey?
3388590	3401380	And you see these maintenance shutdowns going on And they even really cock-teased us with Street Fighter 2 Because we have the theme and the gamer pictures But yet no games yet So Major Nelson's getting a lot of heat for this Being the community face there
3404852	3408495	Basically, he's saying blah, blah, blah.
3408615	3413320	Sometimes developers are not aware of the intense Microsoft certification process.
3414120	3415221	Blah, blah, blah.
3415322	3418545	Sometimes they promise dates and they don't know what the complexity is.
3418605	3419285	Blah, blah, blah.
3420366	3421427	I don't know, guys.
3421667	3428254	I mean, I understand Major Nelson shouldn't be really taking the blame for this crap, so don't blame him.
3428654	3429615	But at the same time,
3430242	3435864	How many different freaking release dates has Capcom announced for Street Fighter 2 in various ways?
3436584	3438265	I mean, it's kind of their own damn faults.
3438585	3445347	They shouldn't have announced the game was coming out if they weren't done with certification or didn't realize or I don't know what.
3445868	3454631	They shouldn't have announced the damn game coming out at all or should have been very vague in it and not get our hopes up time and time again because that's what causes people to get frustrated.
3455591	3455751	Yeah.
3459888	3465450	I really wish they'd just release more games, period, on live.
3465490	3472051	I understand they have to go through quality controls and yada yada yada.
3472271	3478153	I understand why Street Fighter is being delayed because of the online lag that they have, and they need to really get that fixed, but
3480167	3489290	In the same time, I don't understand why they just can't... Like, for example, the thing I'm pissed off and it doesn't really have to do with live too much is how, you know the official Xbox magazine?
3489590	3492511	Well, they have a disc with it that comes with demos that are on live.
3493532	3496172	And, well, it comes with demos.
3496432	3499433	And a lot of demos are already on live, have been on live for like months.
3499834	3504035	So what the hell am I paying for this magazine for demos that I can already download, you know, now?
3504940	3505520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3533447	3536129	Which I would say, actually, I'm going to make a bold statement here.
3536430	3539693	I think that's part of UNO's huge success right now.
3540033	3551363	Obviously, it's a solid game and it's a fun thing to play online, but honestly, I think the reason people are still talking about it and people are so into it is that it's all they've really got that's new in the past many months.
3551643	3553825	Because before that, what was the newest game?
3553885	3555727	Like Astro Pop or some crap.
3556307	3558809	Do you really want to play hard with backgammon?
3559210	3559410	I mean...
3560370	3562291	Does anyone play Backgammon anymore?
3562611	3563811	My dad might.
3563991	3564431	I don't know.
3564912	3567773	I mean... If I want to play Backgammon, I'll have a table.
3568453	3569373	An actual board game.
3570634	3571294	I just don't get it.
3573174	3577016	But, you know, that's their prerogative and how they want to do things.
3579457	3584358	Anywho... By the way, DMN in our chatroom would like to point out that he would like to play Hardwood Backgammon.
3585119	3586459	And is offering to fight you, I believe.
3586519	3587439	I believe he's calling you out.
3588020	3589220	Backgammon sucks.
3589795	3593517	It was always on the other side of the checkerboard, and I was like, what the hell is this?
3593757	3594377	I don't want to play this.
3595157	3607703	Anyways, speaking of stuff that isn't out there, or is not coming out, Australia, Reservoir Dogs the Game, not coming out, because they banned it.
3608603	3609564	Why did they ban it?
3610104	3614026	Well, apparently it was awfully violent, and...
3615230	3623841	Players, participants in a bank heist, can literally blow the heads off of hostages and police as well as execute hostages at point-blank range with the gun shot to the head.
3636123	3638744	Use a series of so-called signature torture moves.
3638804	3659510	Players can use different means to torture hostages and thereby cause the police to lay down their weapons, such as repeated pistol whippings to the side of the head with blood spray evident, burning the eyes of a hostage with a cigar until they scream and die, cutting the fingers off of a hostage with blood bursts as the victim screams in pain.
3660611	3667835	In lieu of taking hostages, the players can opt to a more violent scenario where a slow motion shootout occurs, accentuating the violence.
3668576	3669797	I am buying this game.
3670277	3675000	I know, it's like Australia just gave free advertising for the game for all the other countries.
3675353	3678314	But that is a little odd that they'd ban it before it's even released.
3678394	3680154	Why aren't they going after this game?
3680454	3689457	Why isn't... Okay, when this game comes out, the MPA better get off of Hot Coffee's ass for a little bit of sex because this has slicing out fingers and burning out eyes.
3689737	3690737	I think it's a little worse.
3691257	3694638	Of course, there's no nudity, so... Out of curiosity... What about the movie?
3694838	3699699	Yeah, out of curiosity, can I still walk into an Australian video store and pick up Reservoir Dogs, the movie?
3699919	3700319	Yeah, you can.
3700379	3700819	Okay.
3701420	3702720	That's an interesting little...
3705119	3706460	It's industry's double standard.
3706600	3707620	It's a double standard.
3707760	3708741	Very interesting.
3709481	3710501	How stupid.
3710541	3713322	It's so stupid.
3713482	3721365	Because it's the player that gets to do it, because the interactiveness makes it worse, I guess?
3721865	3723326	Is that the theory behind it?
3723566	3724726	Yeah, I think so.
3725507	3726267	That's awesome.
3727323	3728083	I am so buying it.
3728123	3729843	Yeah, I didn't realize the game was going to be that violent.
3729984	3733264	I mean, that would be kind of stupid to not think a Reservoir Dogs game was going to be violent.
3733284	3737125	It was going to be a cheap-ass port, and now I really want to play this game.
3737645	3738225	All right, we'll see.
3739185	3742086	Anyway, oh, good comment in chat room.
3742126	3750627	DarkTetsuya says, I can't wait to hear He Who Shall Remain Nameless's reaction to that game when it comes out here.
3750647	3751707	Just call him You Know Who.
3751987	3752567	Yeah, You Know Who.
3753648	3754208	Jackie Poo.
3754368	3756208	Anyway, You Know Who emails us every week.
3757014	3759715	I don't, but DarkSakura does because she's our mailbag mistress.
3759735	3777118	So when you email mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, she puts on her hazmat suit, dives into the email bag, and pulls out her favorite and most, mostly, I was about to say most least favorite, her least favorite emails, her mostest, leastest emails.
3777138	3777958	My mostestly.
3779679	3779919	Rob.
3780119	3781659	Just read the damn emails, DarkSakura.
3784620	3785160	Oh, jeez.
3787284	3789325	First email comes from JeremyTodd1.
3789845	3791466	He says, It's JeremyTodd1 again!
3791626	3793427	As if I didn't get that first email.
3793507	3796248	Wait, haven't you read his emails like the past four weeks in a row?
3797108	3797809	Um, fine.
3797849	3798529	I'm skipping it.
3798569	3798949	Sorry.
3799329	3800650	But he does say House of the Dead.
3801190	3804552	And House of the Dead has zombie exploding action.
3804632	3806492	I want to make sure everybody gets heard.
3807053	3809634	He wants to know what we think about arcade type shooters going on the Wii.
3810194	3810874	Like House of the Dead.
3812055	3816657	You know, I was listening to I want to say All Games.
3817779	3845614	they had some type of rumor about like a lightsaber game being on the Wii and I was thinking like you know the Star Wars trilogy game like in the last stage you could actually fight Darth Vader one on one with a lightsaber and I was thinking I'm not a huge Star Wars fan but that would be one of the most fucking badass things ever to play would be like a lightsaber game first person fighter with the Wii controller that is so freaking hardcore they need a Bluntman and Chronic game where you fight Mark Hamill as the cock knocker
3846946	3847846	That would be fantastic.
3847866	3848586	You are so lame.
3848927	3849787	But funny, but lame.
3849807	3851967	I would also like to see Point Blank, please.
3852007	3852307	Thank you.
3852588	3853588	Yes, excuse me.
3854528	3866531	Speaking of Point Blank, actually, one of our other listeners, Robert M., says, if you're still having trouble finding Point Blank DS, try GameCrazy.
3866951	3872673	He says that apparently they've been pretty good to find him there.
3872713	3874674	He found his copy and Trauma Center.
3874994	3875654	How about it, Loki?
3875674	3876034	You gonna go?
3876937	3877937	There's a game craze nearby here.
3880198	3886041	You know, I thought the one that was in the Hollywood video by me closed down, but I think it's... Go buy Kmart on Sunrise.
3886081	3887501	I don't really care to play that game.
3887521	3888982	I mean, I'll go get it eventually.
3889002	3894244	You bitched about it for two weeks straight on this show that you couldn't find it, and now we're telling you, here it is, go get it.
3894264	3897485	You're like, well, I don't know if I want to go get it.
3898006	3901847	Well, I want to go to GameStop because I have credit there, and so I don't want to have to actually pay money.
3902868	3903188	There you go.
3904328	3905789	Also, wants to know...
3907040	3912003	Regarding the upcoming Transformers movie, what if the official movie poster were one large web sign?
3912563	3918447	Make it really damn hard to see the... You know when you held your thumb over the Autobot symbol?
3918467	3920709	You heard that the teaser trailer came up today, right?
3921149	3924571	Yeah, and I tried to watch it on YouTube and it says, this is unavailable.
3925011	3929294	I did see, though, an image from what they thought was going to be Bumblebee.
3929983	3933626	You know why he's not a VW Beetle?
3933726	3934827	Couldn't get licensing?
3935407	3935807	Exactly.
3935867	3938889	Also, Jazz isn't going to be a Porsche.
3940471	3940971	Blink, blink.
3941071	3941812	I've got to be honest.
3942152	3945854	I remember what Transformers was all about, but you name characters and I go whoosh.
3946195	3949697	Jazz was the one whose voice was done by a dude who was Hong Kong phooey.
3951599	3952219	Scatman Crothers.
3952239	3953580	Whoosh.
3953600	3955481	Okay, well you know Casey Kasem did voices in that too.
3956949	3958310	You can't do that on television.
3958750	3960171	Okay.
3960191	3960951	Gummy Bears.
3961331	3961992	Move to Canada.
3962152	3963793	Casey Kasem is a transformer.
3965373	3966154	Casey Kasem?
3966194	3968095	Like the old radio DJ?
3968275	3970016	Yeah, he transforms into stuff.
3970076	3970896	Now that's pretty cool.
3971116	3973478	He was Cliffjumper.
3974498	3975258	Okay, anyway.
3975559	3978200	And he also was Shaggy in Scooby-Doo.
3979100	3979781	Yeah, anyway.
3979901	3981282	He was also Casey Kasem.
3981362	3982522	He was also Casey Kasem.
3982602	3983343	Next email.
3983443	3984263	Casey Kasem's top 40.
3985244	3985844	Next email.
3987362	3992184	Um, one from, uh, H Master Osha, says, Happy Birthday, Sky!
3992784	3993204	Aw, thanks.
3993625	4003028	This is my first email to Orange Lounge, but I've been listening since the episode of someone, I think it was a guest, someone like DJ Ranma S, or someone who called in frequently, swore off boners, oh, that was explicit.
4003148	4005029	Oh no, that was explicit, yeah.
4005089	4007070	Yeah, swore off boners for Lent.
4007330	4011992	That was, uh, before the podcast and live show merged, cause we didn't, yeah.
4012012	4012392	Old school.
4013618	4015659	I mean, our old live shows used to be nuts.
4015719	4017260	We'd talk about really crazy stuff.
4017300	4020201	If you think we're off topic on this show, geez, you should have heard our old live show.
4021221	4021762	Yeah, okay.
4022742	4025523	It was probably last year's Lent, I think, was when he did that.
4026164	4030566	And he said that your gift is something found on Google looking for World of Warcraft AMVs.
4031066	4034227	Hope you find it as funny as I did, but there's not a link to it.
4034908	4037669	You're all doing a great job, even with an anti-Mac co-host.
4037809	4041050	And before I forget, he actually gave me what I'm using as my side of the week.
4041591	4041991	Oh, awesome.
4042331	4042471	Yeah.
4043168	4044048	Well, thank you for the birthday wishes.
4044108	4047610	And I haven't gotten a chance to watch the video yet because I think my Outlook didn't like the attachment.
4048491	4051412	But maybe email it to me.
4051512	4053873	Send it to me as a web link or something and I'll try to get it.
4054213	4057775	Send it to me on YouSendIt or one of those sites.
4057855	4058675	That's usually the best way.
4059056	4059776	I didn't see the attachment.
4059816	4062077	Because Outlook doesn't like attachments from people for some reason.
4062177	4064658	That's why I don't use Outlook to check our mail.
4065399	4067300	I use the web mail because I can check it from work.
4067380	4067900	Oh, stop it.
4068760	4070341	Next up is a
4072864	4074825	Carlos, emailing us.
4076065	4079306	And it says, hey guys, congrats on four years.
4079546	4080027	Yay!
4080267	4080547	Thank you.
4080847	4085048	I've been enjoying this podcast since August something and it's still made of win and awesome.
4085689	4086269	Aw, that's sweet.
4086309	4086609	Thank you.
4086889	4089690	That's where our cake was made of too, win and awesome.
4090774	4096376	Anyways, I went to my local GameStop to pick up Mega Man EX E6 poster they kept for me because I'm a family.
4096796	4102738	And while I was talking to the manager, we're friends, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Nintendo DS package with something in it.
4103198	4104578	It looked like a GBA cartridge.
4104678	4109840	I inquired about this and found out it was a rumble pack for Super Princess Peach, Metroid Pinball, and two other games.
4110440	4114142	Now this didn't surprise me, and I thought gimmicks gimmicks until I saw the price tag, $99.99.
4115162	4118603	In closing, I'd just like to say, what the fuck, Nintendo?
4121581	4123222	I don't think the Rumble fact's $99.99.
4123322	4125984	I think it's $9.99 or something like that.
4126004	4129006	Maybe it was just a mistype or something.
4129026	4129667	There's no way that's $100.
4129707	4132489	Yeah, I think maybe it was just a little oopsie.
4134090	4136692	Well, speaking of oopsies, there's still more email.
4137272	4137612	Alrighty.
4137892	4141475	I'm actually really going through the email because I got quite a bit in just a few days.
4141575	4141895	Yeah, I know.
4141915	4142956	We're taping early this week, too.
4143296	4144077	Good job, listeners.
4145384	4146585	Drown her in that email.
4146865	4147286	Hey!
4147926	4148426	Oh, dude.
4148466	4149607	Sorry if I blew out somebody's speakers.
4150188	4150848	Another one.
4151649	4152209	There's not a name.
4152629	4155351	It's actually Trace said, Hey, guys.
4155451	4155911	It's nice.
4155971	4158693	I was wondering if any of you have played the game Bumpies.
4159113	4163917	It's a DOS game, and I think there would be a remake for the PSP like they did with Lemmings.
4164617	4165398	I've never heard of that.
4165498	4166158	Never heard of it.
4166198	4166538	Sorry.
4167139	4168520	Send us more info or a link or something.
4168540	4169060	We'll check it out.
4169260	4169560	Why not?
4170421	4171322	Especially if it's free.
4171442	4171922	Free rocks.
4173050	4175211	I did get an email that at first sort of pissed me off.
4176272	4179553	And this is going to be, I'm not trying to be TMI about anything.
4180213	4188997	But you know when I said, made the comment that, yeah, if I ever saw any of my kids reenacting something from a violent video game, I'd pop them one.
4189418	4189658	Right.
4189818	4194800	Well, it wasn't necessarily that I would treat violence with violence because we got an email from one of our listeners.
4194820	4197261	You didn't mean you were going to pop the kid with a baseball bat, right?
4197301	4197581	No.
4198162	4198922	No, I used my hand.
4199996	4201957	Okay, this is what I think about.
4202037	4203357	And you hit like a girl.
4203797	4204377	I'm just teasing.
4204938	4205878	I'm going to get hit.
4206158	4207438	You're going to get hit like a girl.
4208459	4208599	No.
4208979	4219102	But seriously, and I'm not going to go into any detail because it's nobody's business, but I do firsthand know the difference between abuse and punishment.
4219922	4225163	And so I think that I very well know where the limits, the line would be drawn.
4226184	4227124	I think that
4228334	4238057	The video game shouldn't be as much as the concern as the home environment that one is raised in as far as what determines if someone's going to turn out a violent person or not.
4238677	4242198	I think that if me just going, oh, well, don't do that.
4242358	4243138	Oh, well, don't do that.
4243299	4243939	Oh, well, don't do that.
4244039	4244719	Stand in the corner.
4245399	4251481	If that's not going to do the job, I'm not beyond, you know, doing a little physical discipline.
4252241	4254462	You know, I was spanked as a kid.
4254582	4256242	I've had much worse.
4257003	4258063	You know, when you...
4258615	4259495	You've learned the difference.
4260035	4260836	Was this an email?
4260956	4262896	Yeah, it was an email.
4262916	4265077	Is this why I'm not going into any detail on the email?
4265137	4270099	But I'd just like to clarify that, that that's my feelings toward it.
4270239	4279942	If it's going to save my child growing up to be some sort of serial killer,
4280818	4287961	or knowing that it's not right to go and kick somebody because they pissed you off, then I'm not beyond it.
4290322	4298065	Let me try to spin it this way, because I like to be the one that likes to make the happy, politically correct, make everybody happy statement, so try to humor me on this one.
4299352	4303354	There are certain choices that you get to make as a parent in the way you want to raise your kid.
4303574	4310137	Actually, there's many choices that you get to make, as long, you know, obviously you don't break the law, but, you know, there's choices that you get to make.
4310497	4320242	And one of those choices is what we're talking about here, but another one that relates to the bigger topic at hand is, you know, do you want your child exposed to violent video games?
4320882	4322363	What do you believe is right for your child?
4322543	4322983	And so on.
4323413	4325255	That's exactly my point.
4325875	4333603	I think that if they're four years old, yeah, sitting them down with dead rights isn't necessarily a good idea.
4333984	4337367	Maybe if they're like 13, that's not so much of a deal.
4337847	4340830	But it's not just the games.
4340870	4342672	You have to look at it environmentally.
4342692	4346476	How many children are raised with violence in their homes every day and don't own a video game system?
4347437	4347557	Hmm.
4348154	4349015	That's my point on that.
4349095	4354718	And, you know, I think it starts with how parents choose to discipline their children and what they allow them to be exposed to.
4355339	4356119	That was my point.
4357260	4357620	Is that it?
4357940	4358101	No.
4358581	4358921	All right.
4359201	4360682	There's more.
4360762	4361063	Two more.
4361603	4362103	Okay, wow.
4362123	4363664	Like I said, got a lot of emails.
4363704	4364085	All right.
4364565	4366246	Oh, we may have to have a two-part show tonight.
4366286	4366686	I don't know.
4366846	4370709	Crispy Creamy wants to know if you have to have an Xbox 360 to be part of the OLR army.
4371189	4372350	Basically, what are the requirements?
4372370	4375292	Because, you know, I said starting up the whole...
4375752	4377434	One minor bitch correction.
4378034	4384680	When it was coined, the phrase, it's actually O-L-R, uppercase, M-Y, lowercase, O-L-R-M-E.
4384780	4385060	Get it?
4386461	4387362	You can thank me for that.
4387662	4392386	I don't think we ever specifically said how we wanted to do the O-L-R-M-E.
4392546	4395549	So the jury's out on that.
4396049	4400933	I think we want to have gaming cliques all over, not just 360, but other games too.
4400993	4402114	If you have a Super Nintendo...
4403487	4405869	We want our Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition.
4406270	4406950	Killer Instinct.
4407311	4408272	Killer Instinct.
4408472	4410494	That should be one branch of the OL Army, absolutely.
4411775	4413817	More to come on the OL Army when we have some ideas.
4413837	4422485	But for any folks that are on MMOs, plug, plug, plug, I have a site, roleplay.darksakura.com, where I'm hosting MMO chats.
4422545	4424887	In fact, Death Cakes still hosted there to this day.
4425027	4426269	Oh, my old Final Fantasy XI link show.
4426289	4427290	Even though none of us are there.
4428183	4431664	You know, they've been going pretty strong on there.
4431804	4436945	You know, if we get a big enough group, you know, I pick the people who are the most responsible to make moderators on the board.
4437005	4444046	So, you know, temporary hosting at least for the MMOs and even tabletop gamers will be up on roleplay.darksakura.com.
4444086	4445387	In other words, the hardcore nerds.
4445727	4446327	The hardcore nerds.
4446367	4447787	Hey, I do tabletop gaming.
4447867	4449087	Well, you're also a hardcore nerd.
4449467	4450008	Hell yeah.
4450548	4451288	Nerd pride, yo.
4451968	4454369	The last one is the biggest email ever.
4454389	4456409	Really?
4456429	4456669	Really.
4457321	4458722	It's a multi-paragraph email.
4458862	4459122	Okay.
4460123	4463645	And this was sent by Joey.
4464185	4464405	Okay.
4465146	4466987	Hello, Orange Lounge Royalty.
4468248	4469228	Ooh, I like this guy already.
4469288	4469569	Okay.
4469809	4470869	Second time writing.
4470969	4473591	First time was on MySpace asking for Genesis titles.
4474592	4478754	I'd first like to thank you in the chatroom for giving some great recommendations to pimp out my Genesis 3.
4480235	4481476	Our chatroom's getting love.
4482076	4482517	Wow.
4482597	4482917	Yeah.
4482937	4483017	Yeah.
4483866	4485728	I would love to join an Orange Lounge clan.
4486008	4488270	I just don't call it the OC or something stupid.
4488810	4489971	Orange Lounge Army sounds good.
4489991	4492453	We would never relate this program to that.
4492614	4493034	Come on.
4493114	4494235	Give us a little credit, dude.
4495476	4496477	Orange Lounge Army sounds good.
4496537	4497738	It's actually OL Army, but we just said that.
4497758	4498178	Yes, that's fine.
4498519	4500941	Though I'm getting rid of a couple of my Xbox 360 games.
4502322	4505505	What's... GR, AW, and Burnout Revenge.
4506045	4506245	Okay.
4506786	4508847	The only reason I am getting rid of...
4510313	4513074	Okay, I'm trying to think of what GR, because my brain... Ghost Recon.
4513154	4514754	Ghost Recon, okay.
4514854	4515534	See, I don't play that.
4515694	4516014	That's right.
4516394	4522916	It's because of Chapter 2, basically the way I feel about the upgrade packs is that they are a buy them or have fun finding a game online anymore.
4523896	4526217	I have no problem with paying for more stuff but not $15.
4527117	4531038	If I bought Chapter 2, I would have spent a total of approximately $80 considering taxes.
4532981	4541425	The Gross Recon was fun, but hardly worth $65 taxes again, and not worth $80 to me, so I'm going to get $35 available towards something else.
4541885	4545827	With Burnout, I'm simply just burned out from playing an HD Xbox clone.
4547324	4550047	I looked up all the prices for stuff and I should have around $120.
4550348	4562302	I'm having a little battle of conscience of whether or not to put it to my inevitable purchase of a Nintendo Wii, bless you, or spend the money on some of the, I guess, delish looking Xbox 360 titles and accessories.
4562902	4567488	I would like input, but I don't expect it because people are really cautious of saying anything these days.
4569690	4576179	Going forward, leaning towards the Wii because I already have Zelda Twilight Princess for GameCube reserved.
4576559	4577841	I will switch it to Wii most likely.
4579410	4585692	In my opinion, either way, you're going to be saving that money because if you were listening to the release date segment, there's really not a lot out there right now.
4585732	4589794	And honestly, it sounds like you've kind of torn through a lot of the big Xbox 360 titles.
4589814	4590854	Like, you know, I like Burnout.
4590874	4591695	It's fun for a while.
4591715	4592755	It's still fun for me right now.
4594316	4597277	So it sounds like you've got most of the good stuff already taken care of.
4597697	4600438	So right now, there's really not a lot out.
4600778	4605580	But if you want good Xbox 360 titles, one I'm pretty excited about that looks pretty hot to me is 99 Nights.
4606479	4635682	but that's not coming out until August so you'd have to be saving your money for that so I think either way you're going to end up saving your money so whether you decide to put it towards a Wii or whatever you know maybe wait and see when we get a little more information on the Wii or what have you you'll notice that my gaming week personally has slowed down a little bit and I've been talking about the same games each week because there hasn't been a lot of new stuff that's been that exciting I think most of us are kind of like we're catching up on old stuff or something so it's kind of a slow period for games right now and I think you'll end up just saving your money for the fall
4637055	4638036	Play Animal Crossing with us.
4661081	4662782	and then they look at the talent.
4663563	4666105	That's why they had them running around the E3 doing interviews.
4666725	4668947	I'm in no way saying that there isn't talent in those clans.
4669888	4671009	They're really decent clans.
4671029	4674291	I'm just saying that because you have to have both looks and talent to be in them.
4674752	4680636	So saying that the beauty contest and whatnot is unfair because you don't actually have to be a hardcore gamer is kind of stupid.
4681017	4685340	That just makes it like every other modeling show that has ever existed that they have never boycotted.
4686124	4689467	I hope they actually do have the Mr. Video Game Beauty contest.
4689567	4696132	Average men would take competitions like these a lot more lighthearted than the ladies, and it would actually be fun and maybe even funny in a lighthearted sense.
4696532	4698574	This just applies to this type of contest, though.
4698654	4699955	Sports for men is a different story.
4701396	4704318	And he also wants to know what the song we used for my Website of the Week segment.
4706240	4710243	It's Candy from DDR Ohasta, which is a Japanese import-only game.
4710463	4710623	Yep.
4711004	4711724	Good luck finding that.
4711744	4712265	Yeah.
4713768	4714869	There are nefarious ways.
4715029	4716529	Well done emails this week.
4716829	4719030	I applaud the listeners.
4719731	4720391	Let's keep it moving.
4720871	4724833	Yes, speaking of fun stuff.
4726393	4728854	Take-Two has been subpoenaed over the hot coffee.
4728974	4729254	Yay!
4729554	4733236	Just when you think your tax dollars are going to something good, they're not.
4734150	4762482	So yes, basically, Take-Two has received grand jury subpoenas, and this is being issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York, requesting the production of documents covering various periods beginning on October 1st, 2001, including those relating to the hot coffee issue and the creation, inclusion, and programming of hidden scenes.
4763856	4775710	and also it should be noted that some people might be able to face jail time which I think is funny because the whole system is a voluntary system so how the hell are they going to go to jail over that?
4779279	4781142	I think it's time for everybody to get past it already.
4781202	4783044	I'm just so sick of hearing about it.
4783104	4790834	I'm all about the new... Listen, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, that's a couple years ago.
4790874	4791374	You know what?
4791775	4794118	I'm all about the Reservoir Dogs game.
4794158	4796281	I'm very interested to see what happens with Grand Theft Auto 4.
4797614	4798054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4820700	4824921	The Nintendo DS is looking to one-up the competition, even though they don't exactly need it.
4824941	4826582	They're doing pretty well on the market right now.
4826642	4831203	However, you may have heard that there is a new Opera browser coming out for the DS.
4831963	4832143	In Japan.
4832583	4833443	In Japan, yes.
4833603	4835844	But it's coming out just in, like, what, less than a month?
4836284	4836704	Pretty nice.
4837785	4839485	There is a Japanese website.
4840017	4843939	Nintendo Japan has a website that talks all about the new browser.
4844960	4853684	The browser will support stylus-based controls for scrolling, going between pages, inputting characters with handwriting or a keyboard on there.
4854164	4861788	However, the bad news is the browser won't be able to display Flash, won't be able to do PDFs, and it's not going to do video or sound.
4862188	4864510	So no YouTubing on your Nintendo DS.
4864550	4865070	Sorry, kids.
4867289	4867970	It's still a start.
4868010	4874652	I hope it supports good JavaScript, because then you can still do like, you know, I know they already have Homebrew for it.
4874692	4876973	The first PSP browser didn't support a lot of that either.
4877514	4879794	Well, the PDFs still aren't supported on there.
4879814	4880335	Yeah.
4880975	4885457	I don't know, whatever, but still though, I mean... It's better than nothing.
4885877	4889959	You might be able to program a chatroom out of that, or an MRC client.
4891939	4894060	Now we're going to have to do OLRDS.com.
4894700	4896001	Sound like a project you want to do, Loki?
4896707	4901369	Bless them for sticking with us when we've been pretty harsh on Sony.
4901489	4903749	We've been giving them a good lashing on this show.
4903829	4906910	Bless you guys for sticking with us and realizing that we're just trying to
4926607	4927587	See the big picture here.
4927647	4928427	I've got Sony stuff.
4928447	4929788	I've got two PSPs myself.
4930128	4931708	And then PlayStation.
4931788	4933828	I actually have like three PlayStations.
4933868	4935009	I like my PlayStation 2.
4935109	4935589	PlayStation 2.
4935629	4936809	And my PlayStation 1.
4936849	4938089	You've got two PlayStation 2.
4938169	4940890	I have a stack of three old school PlayStations.
4941910	4949631	Dan and I tore up a KB Toys trying to find one of the last ones that had the IO port in the back before they put out the New Deal shocks.
4949751	4952172	All right, enough Sony penis talk.
4952232	4952412	Let's...
4953252	4956573	Talk about what other sites you can browse on your Nintendo DS.
4957013	4960834	Of course, you will want to visit first DarkSakura's website of the week.
4961214	4963995	So, DarkSakura, what website should the kids be looking at this week?
4965616	4970497	Well, this site was sent to me by one of the lovely listeners whose email I read.
4970677	4973118	It's kawainot.com.
4973938	4977439	K-A-W-A-I-N-O-T dot com.
4978288	4981791	Kawaii, for those who don't know any Japanese at all, means cute.
4982171	4983672	So it's cutenot.com.
4984212	4985453	This site is messed up.
4985914	4988135	Basically, it's called The Comic for Cute Gone Bad.
4989056	4995281	And just to describe some of this, it's all really adorable, really cutesy stuff.
4995301	4997922	Like, the page I'm on right now has a necktie.
4998263	4999043	And it's smiling.
4999544	5002266	It's a four-panel, you know, vertical comic.
5002866	5003727	And it keeps going down.
5003787	5006469	And then the very last thing has the caption, I'm slowly strangling you.
5008502	5011344	But my favorite one on here is actually the very, very first one.
5011944	5014365	It has two little puffballs meeting up.
5014625	5016286	The first one goes, I'm a cloud.
5017167	5018487	And then nothing in the second panel.
5019268	5021569	And then the third panel, it says, I'm a fart.
5022810	5024811	And the last panel is the cloud one going, ah.
5026532	5027312	This sight.
5028073	5031274	It really follows some of the potty humor, but it's just so, huh?
5031755	5033315	But yeah, it earns Website of the Week.
5035517	5036257	Great suggestions.
5037071	5038272	I love potty humor, so good choice.
5038292	5040453	I'm going to link this particular one in the chat room.
5040493	5040933	Good job.
5041874	5042274	Good job.
5043995	5044415	Alrighty.
5044855	5045836	Go potty humor.
5046756	5049498	Where you won't find potty humor, 99 Nights.
5050838	5054700	And speaking of 99 Nights, you don't need a hard drive to play the game.
5055641	5060023	That was a boo-boo on the website staff at Xbox.com.
5060483	5060843	Fired!
5061284	5062104	Somebody's getting fired!
5063265	5063685	Actually...
5065214	5067536	It's just saying that they support a hard drive for game saves.
5068477	5070379	Or a memory unit.
5070780	5072962	Either way, as long as you have that, good.
5073042	5076585	But it is optimized for the hard drive, so that's good to know.
5076665	5081950	But you don't need it, so go out and buy the game when it comes out in August.
5082591	5089758	Alright, well, this may be a little bit of potty humor, I don't know, but everybody's been wanting to check out what's under the Wii's flap.
5090896	5094517	You know there's that little flap on the Wii and everybody wants to peek under the flap and see what's there?
5094637	5095537	That's so hot!
5095757	5100038	Alright, well, here's what's the latest internet rumor.
5100098	5101019	Actually, not so much a rumor.
5101039	5102059	I think this has been confirmed now.
5102099	5103819	What is underneath that damn Wii flap?
5105880	5108061	There was a tip on GoNintendo.
5108381	5116663	Working at the Nintendo booth this year at E3 after close on the last day, everyone was involved in the tearing down and boxing up of everything that was to be sent back to corporate.
5117299	5117379	So...
5133840	5134661	I guess that's what it is.
5134761	5142966	The memory card slot is there as well as the... I thought I read somewhere that Reggie had confirmed that the GameCube stuff was there too.
5143246	5144247	No, the GameCube is on top.
5144907	5145007	Oh.
5145307	5146808	Or side, however you have that.
5147289	5150671	It would be in, I guess, the picture where you're looking at the front.
5150751	5151411	It would be on top.
5151852	5152412	Okay, gotcha.
5152732	5153353	And this...
5154053	5157977	The memory card slot, he said that was what, that was, you know, under there as well.
5158317	5160979	And people were just, you know, expecting there was another button under there.
5161560	5163321	And the sync... OMG, another button!
5163441	5168566	Oh no, sync button, which, you know, no, it's not to sync up to your Nintendo DS.
5168686	5173430	It's to, you know, sync up to your wireless controllers, just like the Xbox 360 has, so...
5174983	5177384	I didn't even know there was a sync button on the Xbox 360.
5177424	5177904	How'd you set up?
5177924	5178805	Oh, yeah, you have wired controllers.
5178845	5179885	Oh, yeah, I have wired controllers.
5179905	5180226	That's right.
5180246	5180586	Never mind.
5180626	5186008	Yeah, you don't need a sync of... Well, when you get wireless controllers one of these days... I don't want wireless controllers.
5186048	5187349	Wireless controllers will get lost.
5187569	5188409	The couch will eat them.
5189450	5190710	I don't mind wired controllers.
5190750	5191331	I really don't.
5191591	5192191	They're USB.
5192231	5193192	I can use them on the computer.
5193692	5197254	I'm just saying that's what it is for, so... All right, fine.
5197374	5197554	Yeah.
5198874	5204337	But, um... You know, I'm sure that they've got some more secrets, you know...
5206176	5208717	We'll just have to wait and see.
5208757	5214600	Speaking of stuff that has been out before, Castlevania.
5214980	5219462	Apparently it's getting made into a movie by Paul W.S.
5219562	5219982	Anderson.
5221042	5222043	He did Mortal Kombat, didn't he?
5222643	5223603	He did Resident Evil.
5224524	5225524	Didn't he also do Mortal Kombat?
5227905	5231907	Castlevania, he's not going to shoot until he's done with the Death Race 3000 remix.
5233759	5234400	Death Race 3000 Remake
5255563	5259384	and there's lots of unnecessary nudity and violence.
5259824	5263424	It's basically a movie that would have inspired Carmageddon.
5264245	5265965	So just take it as that.
5266685	5271026	They roll out old grannies into the street and they run through them with you and kill people.
5271626	5272586	That's why it's Death Race.
5273766	5274646	Must watch the DVD.
5274826	5275547	It's on PSP too.
5276107	5277887	This has what to do with Castlevania?
5278407	5279647	Oh, I just like Death Race.
5279967	5283768	But he's going to make the game and he says it's going to basically be a
5284969	5295611	I don't know if you'd say a reinterpretation, but it's basically going to cover the origins of the Belmont family and Dracula and all that fun stuff.
5295651	5300972	And he's also going to do DOA, the horrible, horrible movie.
5301012	5301992	He didn't do that movie, did he?
5303433	5303653	Yes.
5303853	5304373	Anderson did?
5304993	5305493	Apparently.
5305853	5306133	No.
5306153	5306913	That movie frightens me.
5306993	5308274	No, somebody else did that movie, didn't he?
5308494	5311134	I'm looking on IMDB right now.
5311774	5313215	You tell us the updates, I'll tell you.
5313235	5314235	Jeremy Bolt, I'm sorry.
5314335	5314715	Thank you.
5316069	5316349	Okay.
5317070	5320051	But, uh, yeah, I don't know.
5320251	5322232	It's interesting.
5323973	5324333	I don't know.
5325014	5325594	What are the updates?
5325754	5326655	What's new on Dinner Live?
5327055	5327595	Oh, it's coming out.
5328456	5332838	They're going to make a sequel to it also.
5333138	5334219	Oh, God.
5335299	5336380	But the movie hasn't even come out yet.
5336400	5337100	What if it flops?
5337620	5337961	Who cares?
5338661	5342223	But I'm most happy about Resident Evil movie because I actually did like Resident Evil Apocalypse.
5342617	5343257	No, I didn't see it.
5343877	5350980	Yeah, it says basically Bolt confirms that... Or Bolt's head.
5351000	5353661	I guess Bolt might be the company.
5353861	5354221	I don't know.
5354381	5354881	I'm stupid.
5355341	5355961	Jeremy Bolt.
5356221	5356542	Anyways.
5356982	5357582	Where's the lion?
5357942	5358442	Who cares?
5358562	5361143	It's coming out with a sequel to this movie that's crap.
5362083	5363304	Well, wait a minute.
5363424	5364404	It's like Charlie's Angels 2.
5364504	5366485	Look, you haven't seen the movie yet.
5366605	5367065	Crap.
5367325	5367745	I saw it.
5367805	5368886	The trailer did suck.
5369086	5369906	I'll give you that.
5372142	5374723	I'm going to answer this question because Loki can't freaking do his research.
5375603	5375803	Hey.
5376243	5377904	Directed by Corey Ewan.
5379284	5380605	Does that say Anderson to you?
5380825	5381405	No, it's Corey.
5381425	5381725	No.
5382065	5382846	Good job, Loki.
5383606	5384026	So what?
5384066	5384786	Hooked on phonics.
5384806	5385386	Worked for Loki.
5386547	5387107	It doesn't matter.
5388114	5389455	Dead or Alive should star only porn stars.
5412270	5417935	It's also, you can call us, 916-226-9067.
5418295	5422199	However, please have mommy or daddy's permission if you're not the one paying the phone bill.
5422819	5426563	While we wait for a phone call, I'd like to ask if there's any last minute stories.
5428124	5430246	There's a story on the internet about how awesome I am.
5432047	5432748	Sure there is.
5432808	5434990	Also about how modest and... Oh, look, we have a call.
5435723	5436903	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5436943	5437344	Who's this?
5438104	5446707	This is DMN, and Loki, I think the idea of putting porn stars in a Dead or Alive movie has to have been the worst idea I've ever heard come out of your mouth.
5446987	5447707	Wait a minute, why?
5448807	5453149	I don't want porn stars fucking up my fighting game.
5453949	5455750	Your fighting game's already fucked up.
5455790	5456730	Have you seen the trailer?
5457470	5459191	I stopped playing after three.
5460540	5461561	because I don't want to get a 360.
5461601	5463142	Oh, that's right.
5463683	5469609	Okay, you're the ultra-est of Nintendo fanboys, though.
5470770	5471831	This is not true.
5471891	5475554	Just because I work at Nintendo does not mean I'm a Nintendo fanboy.
5475734	5480118	So in the next Gen Wars, which console are you going to buy?
5481019	5484182	First, I'm buying a Wii just because I conveniently work at Nintendo.
5484262	5485744	Okay, but is there going to be a second?
5486764	5491929	If somebody puts a gun to my head, I will probably break down and buy a 360.
5493070	5494030	No love for PS3?
5495091	5505080	No, because I had a little light for him, but after what I was reading about Kazurai being the pot calling the kettle black, that's not happening anymore.
5507102	5510184	What did you want to call in about tonight, besides berating Loki, which I appreciate?
5510204	5511325	I've seen the week.
5515419	5516679	You have seen Wii.
5517079	5520941	I have seen Wii, and I have not seen it in my department, so I can talk about it.
5521741	5523081	Okay.
5523361	5526862	They were doing a little retail tech demo of it at corporate.
5527002	5527802	It looked pretty cool.
5529563	5530263	I want to test it.
5532004	5533704	I'm really excited.
5535044	5536465	Let me ask you a vague question.
5536505	5537925	If you don't want to answer it, that's fine.
5538705	5540626	Did you see anything that we didn't see at E3?
5542546	5544307	I only saw people playing it.
5545300	5551784	I didn't get a chance to see any screens, but they looked like they were genuinely enjoying using that software and the hardware.
5553005	5554766	Oh, these are real people, not actors?
5555767	5556627	These are real people.
5556827	5557348	Oh, wow, okay.
5558448	5561150	Well, you know, but a lot of people at E3 had a lot of fun with it.
5561230	5561530	I did.
5561691	5562711	I had fun with the Wii at E3.
5563552	5564452	I'm definitely buying one.
5564492	5564953	Hell yeah.
5565453	5566393	Oh, yeah, I am too.
5567574	5569555	Just for the price alone, because I know it's going to be under $250.
5569916	5571116	There's no question.
5571697	5571917	All right.
5572864	5574765	Anything else on your mind tonight, Mr. DMN?
5575485	5576345	Happy birthday.
5576465	5579206	You suck for not staying in Seattle longer than two hours.
5579406	5580386	It's a layover.
5580446	5581066	Give me a break.
5584307	5584567	All right.
5584587	5585668	Well, thank you for the birthday wishes.
5585728	5586388	I appreciate it.
5586428	5590409	Too bad I went and got sunburned all over my scalp on my birthday.
5590949	5593610	And now it's all gross and peeling and nasty.
5593730	5596831	So I'll leave you with those happy thoughts, all right?
5597491	5597851	All right.
5597931	5598611	Take care, guys.
5598651	5599252	Have a good one, buddy.
5599772	5599992	Bye.
5600312	5600512	Later.
5602283	5604385	Any other last minute stories anyone would like to share?
5606226	5607447	Oh wait, never mind, we got another call.
5607487	5608027	Wow, that was quick.
5608067	5609088	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5609108	5609468	Who's this?
5609708	5610048	Hi.
5610649	5610909	Hi.
5610949	5611629	Raven's Dolphin.
5611790	5613871	Wow, you call every week and you manage to get through.
5614211	5614892	You've got the luck.
5614932	5616132	Well, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
5616653	5617934	I can't believe I missed this.
5618454	5619014	You missed what?
5619935	5620855	Orange Lounge Radio.
5621096	5625138	Oh, well, we didn't really play up the fact that we were taping on Thursday this week.
5625158	5626119	You know, life goes on.
5626339	5628901	What did you think of the show you heard so far?
5628961	5630842	You can download the rest on Sunday like everyone else.
5631365	5633286	I guess I have two things a lot, Skype.
5633586	5634627	Oh, stuff about that.
5635087	5637989	I just called in to say... What was I supposed to call in to say?
5639110	5640651	Uh... Phoenix Wright Rules.
5641991	5642291	Okay.
5644213	5646034	Uh... What else?
5646594	5650997	The Xbox... Oh, do you have any problems with the Xbox hooking up to your PC?
5652437	5652658	Nope.
5653098	5654078	No, mine works fine.
5654339	5656360	What kind of problems are you having with the Xbox and the PC?
5657440	5659061	Well, I just don't want to do it.
5659342	5659622	I just...
5660549	5662750	Do you have Service Pack 2 installed on your PC?
5662770	5663750	Yeah, I got everything.
5663790	5664750	I just don't want to do it.
5669191	5672652	It's been so long since I did it, I don't even remember what the process was.
5673032	5678454	What point of the process, like are you trying to sync it on, like you downloaded the program on the PC, right?
5678914	5679154	Yeah.
5679174	5680574	And it just doesn't see your Xbox at all?
5681235	5681795	Doesn't see it.
5681815	5683115	It goes like, hey, nothing.
5683515	5684095	Go to hell.
5684756	5685056	Weird.
5685296	5686436	Are you guys on wireless networks?
5687389	5688449	Yeah, wireless wired.
5688669	5692750	Do you have your Xbox 360 hooked to a wireless router of its own?
5692790	5697271	Because it's not going to pick up just, like, it doesn't have Wi-Fi built inside it.
5697291	5699172	You have to have a separate... Yeah, yeah.
5699292	5700352	I have to figure that out.
5700612	5701673	Okay, maybe that's what's wrong.
5703633	5706554	Oh, I have one last thing to say.
5706794	5707034	Okay.
5708054	5709695	I'm trying to buy a PS3.
5710315	5711015	Can't say anything.
5711675	5711975	Okay.
5712455	5715536	Well, then why, what is making you deciding to buy a PS3?
5716912	5719473	Because of the Blu-ray, I want to see how it works.
5719773	5724874	You're going to spend $500, $600 on a console to see how it works.
5726194	5728395	Hey, I have no time.
5728455	5731615	Can't you just look at a demo at retail and make a decision there?
5732056	5733896	No, I'll take this home and destroy it.
5733936	5735156	See, then you sound like a collector.
5738766	5743449	You sound like one of the hardcore dorks that has to have it all, like DarkSakura and myself.
5744070	5745090	Yeah, that's kind of it.
5745250	5748873	That's why I still have my original Game Boy and my Game Boy Color in my pocket.
5749753	5750474	See, there you go.
5750614	5751334	I knew you were a nerd.
5751975	5753356	Only nerds listen to this show, right?
5754456	5755037	Yeah, I guess so.
5755097	5756678	Alright, any other thoughts, Raven Stolfen?
5757198	5758519	Only nerds host this show.
5760600	5761040	Not much.
5761141	5764823	I just wanted to say that I can't believe I missed it.
5765643	5766724	That's all right.
5767084	5767604	We'll be back.
5767825	5772748	We're going to pre-tape next week's show on Saturday night because I'm going back to L.A.
5772768	5773609	It's crazy.
5773649	5778912	I have a crazy schedule, and I appreciate DarkSakura and Loki putting up with my crap schedule.
5779132	5781574	But we'll be taping on Saturday next week.
5781694	5781974	All right.
5782515	5783415	Happy birthday.
5783435	5783676	Bye.
5783936	5784136	All right.
5784156	5784456	Bye-bye.
5786658	5787839	I'll see if anyone else wants to get through.
5787859	5788919	We'll go for one more call.
5788999	5790941	Does anyone have a last-minute story they want to do?
5790961	5792042	I have a couple last-minute stories.
5792102	5792342	Okay.
5792522	5792642	What?
5793798	5800460	Code Masters is working on trying to get the original Sensible Soccer that was on Amigo, or Sensible World of Soccer, I'm sorry.
5801700	5804661	It was actually supposed to be an unlockable in Sensible Soccer 2006.
5805761	5811822	They couldn't do it, so they're actually trying to, there's talk about them putting a Sensible World of Soccer on Xbox Live Arcade.
5812723	5814183	That's for our UK friends, by the way.
5814343	5815563	Hooray for new arcade games.
5815763	5818444	We got a call coming in, so I'm going to interrupt you before the second story.
5819127	5820067	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5820087	5820447	Who's this?
5821067	5821668	It's Ranma.
5821708	5822568	Who else would it be?
5822968	5824188	Ranma!
5824228	5826989	Now, are you the one that gave up boners for Lent?
5827829	5828389	No, that wasn't me.
5828409	5828929	That was Loki.
5829149	5829369	I know.
5829389	5830730	That was explicit.
5830970	5832170	That would never be Loki.
5832230	5833030	No, it was explicit.
5833330	5834411	No, I'm not passing the buck.
5834651	5835831	All right, what's on your mind, Ranma?
5836531	5839792	DOA the movie will rock because of one reason and one reason only.
5840232	5841032	Wait, wait, wait.
5841332	5843453	Is it because that chick from Sin City's in it?
5843713	5843913	Yes.
5844393	5844813	I knew it.
5845153	5845533	I knew it.
5845953	5847314	I can read a straight guy's mind.
5847534	5848454	I know exactly...
5849164	5850826	What's her face from... She doesn't get naked.
5851106	5854089	Too Fast, Too Furious is in it, too, as Kasumi.
5854129	5854930	Isn't that the same chick?
5855090	5855471	I don't know.
5855891	5856532	It's the same chick.
5857773	5858614	Did you see Sin City?
5858774	5859014	No.
5859435	5859635	Okay.
5859675	5860055	I saw it.
5860095	5861036	It was awesome.
5862237	5863198	Sin City was okay.
5863339	5865601	A little overrated by the dork culture, I think.
5865661	5866362	A little overrated.
5866502	5867363	I don't think it was all that.
5867783	5870726	But if Angelina Jolie truly isn't the second one, that's pretty hot.
5870766	5871327	Because I actually...
5872583	5883069	Even though I hate tabloid news, and I don't know what the fuck this has to do with gaming, as much as I hate tabloid news and all that stuff, I actually really like Angelina Jolie.
5883109	5886150	Well, she's supposed to be doing Tomb Raider 3 right now, so hey.
5886290	5888051	Okay, well I guess that is game related then, thank you.
5889452	5895575	So what else is on your mind besides making love to whatever her name is, Devon is her name?
5895975	5896976	Devon Aoki.
5897016	5897736	Devon Aoki.
5898637	5900958	What else is on your mind besides making sweet love to her?
5901698	5905459	The Circuit City $8.96 massive fire sale.
5905719	5907099	Oh, I heard about this.
5907639	5910260	Weren't they like selling Final Fantasy 4?
5910800	5912020	Did you bring this up on Sunday's show?
5912461	5913121	Everything's a blur now.
5913141	5916882	Weren't they selling like Final Fantasy 4 for like $9 and you could turn around and sell it at Walmart for $18?
5917202	5918982	That wasn't me.
5919002	5921323	That was Set Rock 1215 and SSJ100.
5921783	5925224	Man, I can't do it because I'm not crossing the bridge to Jersey to pull it off.
5926264	5930025	I don't know if I'd read it on the forums or where the hell I'd read that, but I was like, that's dirty.
5930765	5931285	That's dirty.
5932363	5933204	Did you go to the sale?
5933224	5933944	Did you pick anything up?
5934364	5935885	Yes, I went Saturday morning.
5936025	5938026	I hit three different Circuit City.
5939047	5942288	I got The Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, Pitfall Bundled.
5942568	5945770	I got Dig Dug, Digging Strike.
5945830	5948532	I also picked up Final Fantasy IV, but it was $19.99.
5948692	5953254	It was supposed to be going down to $8.96 next week, so I'm going to get that price match.
5953274	5954495	Wow, they have Digging Strike?
5954535	5955215	I kind of want that.
5956756	5958397	I still have it sealed if you want it.
5959097	5959417	Really?
5960198	5960938	I kind of want it.
5961973	5962754	Send me an email.
5962894	5963174	I do.
5963194	5964435	I love Dig Dug.
5964575	5966837	I've really been curious to check out the DS one.
5967317	5969259	There's nothing else coming out this week.
5969339	5970540	Maybe when my trips die down, though.
5970560	5972021	I'm going to check our local Circuit City.
5972141	5974203	And if they don't have it, then I'll shoot you an email.
5974943	5976925	And I also picked up Dr. Mario Puzzle League.
5977486	5977926	Oh, that reminds me.
5977946	5979727	Tetris DS should have been called Tetris Classic NES Edition.
6007003	6015625	You know, Tetris D, yeah, I mean, sure, they hoard the NES stuff, but what's also interesting about it is that there was so much more there than just Tetris.
6015665	6021406	I mean, that mode, I can't remember what it's called, but the Metroid one, with Metroid in the background, I think it's a different game altogether.
6022566	6029747	I'm playing through the game, I hear the remix from Gyromite, I almost fell out of my seat, flipping out how awesome that was, and I realized, damn, I'm old.
6029887	6032727	Nintendo knows how to milk their retro factor.
6033068	6033348	Believe it.
6033368	6033808	Got that right.
6034148	6034548	Believe it.
6034748	6035648	Anything else on your mind, Rama?
6036465	6041548	Next Sunday, when the sale is official, I'm going to hit those Circuit City stores again for two more games.
6041668	6043549	If they don't have it, I'm bringing my papers.
6043629	6048192	I'm going to Best Buy, Target, all in just a price match and track the games down.
6048272	6048512	All right.
6048532	6051214	Keep us posted on your bargain hunting process, okay?
6051534	6052474	Oh, I will be.
6052675	6052935	All right.
6052955	6053675	Have a good one, Ranma.
6053695	6054015	Take care.
6054035	6054856	I will.
6054916	6055937	And stay away from those boners.
6055957	6056417	Runtime.
6056897	6057778	Final May 2007.
6059118	6060619	Sweet brew party.
6060699	6061240	You know it.
6061500	6061800	Yep.
6062180	6063161	All right, crazy kids.
6063401	6063861	Have a good one.
6064221	6064502	You too.
6064842	6065142	Bye.
6065967	6067609	Do you just say holla at the end?
6069050	6070691	All right, that's all the calls for tonight, kids.
6070711	6074115	We're going to start to wrap things up here with one more story.
6074955	6075536	Oh, that's right.
6075556	6076337	You had your last minute thing.
6076357	6076877	I'm sorry, DarkSakura.
6076897	6078779	Yeah, and you completely cut me off.
6078819	6079720	My bad.
6079740	6081361	Oh, then Von Chun is very well worth it.
6081401	6083623	I have some news for our World of Warcraft players.
6084544	6084824	Oh, okay.
6084844	6085945	Then this is something I might want to know.
6086146	6086526	Uh-huh.
6086606	6087747	The Realm Transfer went live.
6088488	6090730	Five servers are supporting it right now.
6091408	6096853	is Altar of Storms, Argent Dawn, Demon's Soul, Illidian, and Warsong.
6097274	6099315	Others are going to be following soon.
6099395	6104981	European players should see it coming up not too far afterwards.
6105521	6107963	And again, it is $25 to move between servers.
6108023	6111186	Just check out Blizzard's site on worldofwarcraft.com.
6111967	6115430	Also, World of Warcraft Burning Crusade.
6115791	6117152	The trailer is out now.
6117859	6121961	There is showing off what the new accessory in the game is.
6122701	6123561	Flying Mount.
6125682	6127423	There's going to be a lot of people excited about that.
6127843	6132145	The trailer is actually available on Eurogamer TV.
6132305	6140168	If you go to Eurogamer.net slash TV video, there should be a link up there to it.
6140848	6142729	I'm going to be watching that shortly.
6143029	6144650	Last up is Dance Factory.
6145610	6151451	Um, basically, it's, uh, trying to, I guess, dethrone Dancing Stage in the UK, with Dancing Stage being DDR.
6151471	6155732	It's this really crappy, um, game that you can put, it's made by Comaster.
6155832	6159573	Yeah, that's what I was... You put it in a CD and it generates steps for you.
6160833	6161553	It's a neat concept.
6161653	6162814	It really is a neat concept.
6163174	6172075	However, part of the fun of DDR is, you know, the interesting things that Konami likes to pass us in the music.
6174056	6174536	So, uh,
6175011	6176932	That's my last minute news.
6177872	6180713	Unless you're interested in playing Diner Dash on your PSP.
6180973	6183894	Actually, I've played Diner Dash 2 on the computer.
6184054	6184874	Don't ask me why.
6185214	6186875	I think because Loki was playing it at E3.
6186935	6189115	And I was like, I want to play that.
6189476	6191296	And I actually downloaded it.
6191336	6192136	How sad am I?
6192276	6194617	I actually have one more bit of news also for our UK listeners.
6195557	6197018	Disgaea 2 is coming out in the UK.
6199139	6200419	Well, I damn well hope so.
6200599	6203100	That has a huge cult following to it.
6204025	6204345	Good to hear.
6204646	6206247	It looks pretty interesting at E3.
6206827	6207068	All right.
6207308	6208549	So that's it, I promise.
6208989	6209189	Okay.
6209430	6209790	Dot com.
6210791	6211351	Excellent.
6211932	6216676	Anyways, we've got a last minute story here.
6218237	6218998	Silent Hill.
6219278	6223282	Of course, we know that the Japanese are really trying to promote the movie over there.
6224122	6231429	And what's kind of interesting is they're doing this brand new kind of like a cafe thing.
6232448	6261655	Akihabara's Made in Japan That's pretty much the whole electronic district Made in Japan It's basically a cafe that's covered with Silent Hill posters which are just everywhere all sorts of memorabilia including white nurse zombies in super short skirts serving red pyramid curry and tomato juice That's awesome
6262353	6266436	And one of the pictures on that site, they had the little pyramid head guy in the back.
6266456	6267877	Did you post that in your live journal?
6268077	6269177	No, that was something else.
6269217	6271078	That was from the haunted house.
6271279	6271739	Oh, never mind.
6271819	6272499	Okay, this is different.
6272559	6272779	Sorry.
6273160	6274100	Yeah, this is something different.
6275241	6276041	They are pretty hot.
6276542	6277442	Nurses are pretty hot.
6277482	6278823	They don't look like zombies.
6279283	6279644	All right.
6281305	6283246	Well, if you're in Japan, check it out.
6283946	6284527	Take pictures.
6284567	6285067	Send them to us.
6285914	6295677	Looking at the Japanese website, it's maidin.jp slash silent.html.
6296517	6297998	It's some very interesting stuff.
6298058	6308981	Basically, it has a picture of the tomato juice and it has a picture of the pyramid head curry, which looks very tasty, actually.
6309001	6310081	I don't know.
6310121	6312022	If you saw the movie, it might not be so tasty.
6313306	6316548	and a huge-ass picture of Red Pyramid sitting in the background.
6316568	6317228	That's pretty hot.
6318329	6318649	All right.
6319170	6320150	Well, that was it.
6320771	6323812	I want to remind you guys there is no Part B this week, but you know what?
6323892	6327715	Part A is like an hour and a half, well over that, so you guys got a good show this week.

6377008	6378009	Loki, your final thought.
6378709	6381630	I can't find this trademark and it's driving me nuts.
6381770	6382671	I know it's here.
6383451	6388653	The problem is it's really hard to search this stupid Japanese trademark database.
6389193	6389473	All right.
