00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
George, lounge, radio.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Wonky.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, June 4th, 2006.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
DS lights hit the street a bit early.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Could gaming be shown at the next Olympics?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And more add-ons are announced for RPGs like Final Fantasy XI and Oblivion.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,120
Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,200
This is episode number 185 for this June the 4th of 2006.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,280
We're here to talk about video games and gaming and the gaming culture and all the gaming

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,320
news you guys really want to know about.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
And I'm here to help you do that.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
My name is Rob Roberts.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,640
You might know me as Sky and she's here to help you too.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,180
Her name is Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie Sommers.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,140
I help those who help themselves.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,100
You help people who want to be helped.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,100
Yes.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,100
Alright.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,100
How are you recovering from FonomÃ©?

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,660
We did a live show there last week.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:14,460
I've slept a lot, because I'm actually on medical leave for two weeks, so I've been

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,280
doing a lot of sleeping.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,040
For those folks that have shown concern in the past through emails and stuff that you've

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,500
You've kind of been getting a lot of sickness in the past six months on the show.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,540
To not go into it in too much detail, all of the random illnesses that I've had have

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,820
all stemmed from one thing, which is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which for those who think

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,020
that taking an app will help you get over it, screw you, because it doesn't.

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,380
It's a cumulative issue.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,380
It's something that just takes nutrition, time, eventually it goes away.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,700
Some people have it their whole lives.

31
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,980
Some people are bedridden for years with it.

32
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm just really tired.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,900
I was actually reading in Wikipedia about this because when you were talking to me about

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,060
this on AOL, you actually linked me to something in Wikipedia on it and it turns out you have

35
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,900
something in common with Cher.

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,420
Oh, joy.

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,000
If I could turn back time.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,900
You don't have an affinity towards hay or anything like that.

39
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
I wouldn't be like a horse.

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,260
Oh, that must be the one and only Loki because here come the jokes from Tech Master Loki.

41
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,340
Cher is like, you know what?

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,980
Everyone wondered what happened to Mr. Ed. Cher is what happened to Mr. Ed.

43
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,540
They're the same person! Same person! My mother loves Cher.

44
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,420
It's kind of scary. I actually went to a Cher concert and I know you want to make all

45
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,740
those jokes about, you know, because I'm gay, I must love Cher.

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,900
She's okay, but my mom loves her.

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,220
Oh my gosh, loves her. But she's made out of porcelain and ceramic and acrylic.

48
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,820
Now wait, we're not Cher talk, so back to games for a minute. In FonamiCon last

49
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,100
week,

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,060
you somebody actually brought you chocolate right yes one of

51
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,740
one of our listeners brought me chocolate and i'm very very very grateful

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,100
and it got all over the bottom of my purse so i had to uh

53
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,540
wash my purse only a couple pieces got out all the rest of it were in my tummy

54
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,300
i did share a couple of pieces because i'm nice there's no way

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,540
you didn't share it with me i would have if you'd hung around maybe rob's gotta

56
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,100
go boom i did yeah i did the total diva thing

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,700
at Famicon. I flew it, I see ya! When I say fly in, I mean, you know, drove up and parked,

58
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,500
I parked on the street next to the convention center just a little ways away, and uh, you know,

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,420
just walked in, did the show, and kind of left. And that's, you know, I did kind of look around

60
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,500
the first day, I saw what there was to do, but unfortunately I don't follow anime a whole lot,

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,300
myself personally, so I didn't get it. I went nuts in the dealer's room Sunday. Yeah. I bought Dan

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:47,780
a Famicom controller-looking pencil box, and I bought him an Ice Climber cell phone strap

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,080
with the... it's all digitized.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,660
They do have some video game stuff around there.

65
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,660
I noticed there's a lot of Kingdom Hearts.

66
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,100
I bought myself a Slime plushie.

67
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,260
A lot of Kingdom Hearts, a lot of Final Fantasy, a lot of Squeenix love.

68
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,580
And I bought a doll.

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,220
Red Octane had a booth that's about the size of this desk.

70
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Of a computer desk.

71
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
A normal computer desk.

72
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,740
Yeah, Red Octane wasn't really showing much, were they?

73
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,740
They had Guitar Hero and they were selling controllers and that's it.

74
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,740
But in the groove of Absint, which is kind of weird.

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,740
They were selling the

76
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,740
DDR pads, but that's about it. They were just selling stuff.

77
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,740
They were a vendor. They weren't trying to show off new games or anything.

78
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Here's our crap buy it. You know, that type of thing.

79
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,740
I'll tell you what was impressive though was Yes Japan, they have Japanese lessons, but they also

80
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,300
a label that are bringing out a lot of Japanese artists in the United States, and one of them

81
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,140
is Guitarvator, who did a lot of the music in Jessup Radio.

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
Oh cool!

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,900
Guitarvator wasn't there this year, although their guitarist made it out, or one of their

84
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,540
people made it out, and was doing some stuff with a couple of the other bands there, but

85
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,600
I didn't get to see it, I think it was actually, I think it was like near our panel or something

86
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,960
around our panel, so I didn't actually get to see this, but I did get to talk with them

87
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,240
and you know, who knows, you guys might hear something, some Guitar Vader on our station

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
soon.

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Cool.

90
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Very cool.

91
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,840
I just want to say real quick, as far as live appearances go, we are confirmed for Fauna

92
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,100
May 2007, and next year maybe we're looking to broadcast from the center stage, which

93
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,440
should be pretty awesome.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,520
We are, our friend there is working on getting us broadcasting ability.

95
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Very cool.

96
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,240
And just other live appearances coming up, I know in July, and not even these guys know

97
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,120
about this yet, but there's the Sacramento thing is confirmed for July.

98
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:48,520
And how I knew about that, is I ordered a doll, I'm getting into the 60 centimeter volks

99
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
of B2 dolls.

100
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,000
I ordered from JunkieSpot and he called me today to make sure that my address was right.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,760
and just gave me all kinds of pointers and tips

102
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,580
and said, and we're gonna be at this convention.

103
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,000
I was like, oh, I might be there.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,260
That's funny.

105
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,760
So I find that ironic.

106
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,320
No, we're gonna do that in Sacramento in July

107
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,120
and then they're trying to get us to Seattle next year

108
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,000
if we can afford it.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,900
I know at least I'll go

110
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,280
and I think Jamie was talking about going

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
so maybe if we can get Loki,

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,400
we'll all go to the Sakura Con next year.

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
And then I...

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,080
It's me Con.

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm hoping to do one East Coast Con next year.

116
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
I don't know what or when yet.

117
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,840
That'll really be up to Ranma,

118
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,320
who's my like East Coast buddy.

119
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,920
He'll have to tell me which con I should go to, so we'll see.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,080
And maybe DarkSakura will come with me if she's got the dough.

121
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,040
Someone's got money. We'll see. Alright, let's get into some gaming.

122
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,220
We always like to start off the show with how is your gaming week?

123
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,460
So let's talk about it. Oh, first though, a shout out to the invisible

124
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,680
forecast, our chat room, www.orangelauncherater.com. Click on chat

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,200
and a little bit of talk there in the chat room right now.

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,680
I don't know why Snakes on a Plane jokes are coming up, but that's what Sakurina is doing

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
right now.

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
I haven't seen him in a while in chat room though.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
Blaze wants to know when we're all coming out to the East Coast.

130
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,440
I at least will probably try to come to a con in the beginning of next year.

131
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,360
We'll see.

132
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,120
And then Spirit Snare is linking us to a topic regarding Fonami07 on the Fonami boards.

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,840
I guess there's actually a discussion about us at Fonami07 there, so that's kind of cool.

134
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,200
And then DJ Pooh Eater says, I thought it was the Cher show.

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,160
Okay, let the joke die.

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,920
It was actually Spirit Snare that bought me chocolate.

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Awesome.

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Sweet.

139
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,120
Alright, anyway, let's do how your gaming week was.

140
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
Dark Sakura, want to start us off?

141
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,520
I played some Ragnarok, and I made Assassin, finally, I hit job level 50, and now I'm like

142
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,480
Assassin job level 24, and that happened in like a day.

143
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,600
And that's basically been it.

144
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,700
There has been UNO going on in my house.

145
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,640
And we were going to buy a whirlwind pinball machine, but that fell through.

146
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,480
We got back our Judge Dredd machine, and as it's working out, we've got a line in on a

147
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
jackpot.

148
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,840
Well, a pinbot right now, but Dan's wanting to find a jackpot, which has the same...

149
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,300
It's pinball games, people.

150
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,900
Has the same play field as pinbot and has the same music as pinbot and the special music.

151
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,460
It's like a combination of pinbot and bride of pinbot with a souped-up display and board

152
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
and everything.

153
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,260
Okay, if you get that, I'm going to be at your house every day.

154
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,980
I told Dan that and he was like, well, half the reason we get the pins is for friends

155
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
to play.

156
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,780
You still have to come over and play our other pins too.

157
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,540
I was going to say, what is with the sudden interest in pinball games?

158
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Sudden my butt?

159
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,540
It feels...

160
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Dan's been...

161
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,520
Yeah, but you guys haven't really bought machines before.

162
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
It seems like...

163
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Well, we had an apartment before.

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,620
All right, all right.

165
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,820
We have a garage now, which we intend on filling with machines, but Dan's been downloading

166
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,080
the pinball emulators like PinMame and some of those for like ages, and one of the machines

167
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,200
that we're really, really looking for, although it's really expensive, we want to get a good

168
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600
deal on one, is a Black Knight 2000.

169
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,040
I think I've asked this on a previous show, like a long time ago, before we were podcasting.

170
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
Is PinMame based out of Sacramento, the people who do that?

171
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Nearby.

172
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,660
seen a car around town that has like a pin maim license plate and I'm like, dude is that

173
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
the guy?

174
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
No dude, it's Carmichael.

175
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Really?

176
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
I think he's out of Carmichael because Dan's been by there.

177
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,480
We need to get that guy on the show.

178
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
That's just a stone's throw away.

179
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,720
We'll have to get ahold of him.

180
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,440
Loki practically, no, I know you're in Orangevale, I'm not Carmichael.

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
It's all a blur to me.

182
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Suburbs of Sacramento.

183
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Anyway.

184
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
It's the various areas.

185
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Anyway.

186
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
You have goldfish.

187
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
They're gone, sorry.

188
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
You bet.

189
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I no longer like you.

190
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
They're actually pretzel goldfish.

191
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Anyway, your games.

192
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Games, oh yeah.

193
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,680
I've been playing goldfish the game. No, I actually have been doing not a whole

194
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,760
much of gaming. I've been intending on sitting down with Kingdom Hearts but

195
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,800
I've been like meh meh and it's just been pinball pinball pinball pinball and

196
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,160
I played pack... I played Dig Dug on one of those little joystick looking video game

197
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,640
machines. Oh machine in a joystick? Yeah the machine in a joystick thing. They had a

198
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
Pac-man score tournament, and then I was like screw y'all. I'm playing Dig Dug

199
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,020
And so I got like further in Dig Dug than anybody in the house could. Sweet. Yep. All right Dig Dug, man

200
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,140
I'm going over to the chat room who's all lit up about pinball. I'm sure you'll love this Jamie

201
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,300
Yuri, lover says South Park pinball equals the shiz

202
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,300
Bandit says the Super Mario Brothers pinball ruled. They had one of those at that place that went to and it was already sold. Oh

203
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,900
Because Super Mario World pinball. Now there's two types of Super Mario pinball because one was for kids. This was the kid size

204
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't like the kids size one, but they had an adult size one too. That was awesome

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,380
They had the kid one at Stockton Golf the Lord of the Rings pinball is the win

206
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,540
But it was the Lord of the Rings pinball and Star Wars pinball were of the pinball

207
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,840
I think it's called pinball 2000 series

208
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,300
Which actually did not appeal to a lot of pinball players because it was more of an old-school pinball thing

209
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,820
So there's I think those are the only two pinball 2000 machines are and we're not seeing any more

210
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:01,300
I think Williams stopped making pinball machines. Hmm. One of the last pinball machines that I would love to play is

211
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,460
It was called Big Bang Bar, which was one that Capcom did.

212
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,240
They made something like 16 of them, and I've actually seen video of someone playing one,

213
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,100
and the guys who owned that machine were kind enough to lend the layout of the board and

214
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,780
the ROM set to put on pinmame.

215
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
Oh, that's cool.

216
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,620
So, it's a very good table, but there's only 16 of them in existence.

217
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,260
I'd love to see one.

218
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,380
We need, yeah, we do need Orange Lounge Pinball.

219
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,140
DJ Pooeater says, O-L-R Pinball would be fun.

220
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,180
You get to bang around Lookie's balls.

221
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,240
I don't know how lucky you would feel about that, but I do like DJ poo eaters other comment about I like the Elvira pinball

222
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Cuz Elvira is the shit

223
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,480
I didn't I you know actually one of the old-school ones that they had there that they were repairing was an Elektra pinball

224
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,820
They wouldn't had the three levels the inside level the medium and the outside level. It's actually pretty

225
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,560
From what I understand pretty hard to get one of those, but we actually traded them our fathom pinball for Johnny mnemonic

226
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,320
DMN has a great idea snakes on a plane pinball. I think

227
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,760
As if. It was sad, though, is that, you know, I think that pinballs are like a dying breed.

228
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,960
Let me just kind of say, what do you think about pinball games on a video?

229
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,560
Well, they've actually, this is a good thing, the people who do

230
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,200
UltraCade are doing UltraPin.

231
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,360
And the way that that's going to work is that it's going to be

232
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,600
a humongous widescreen LCD laid out like a pinball table.

233
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,280
What? They've actually had some of these at trade shows. That's kind of neat.

234
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,500
and I like that matrix displays up in the back is it really a replacement for

235
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,680
an actual table though

236
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,980
but I don't know the whole thing about this is that is actually going to

237
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,740
emulate some like 30 to 60 I think something

238
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,660
a classic tables including Black Knight

239
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,420
pin by right up in by it I have to find some more information on it they've had

240
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,540
and they've actually I think

241
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,500
this is something test locations I guess that's cool but it's

242
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,660
I just don't like that idea as much as actually watching the metal ball go up

243
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,080
the ramp and around I'd have to see it but I'd say I'd say though that for the

244
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,440
sake of you know since these tables are getting harder and harder to find I

245
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,540
think that it's it's a good idea it's a good idea to bring it out there for

246
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,560
people who who miss the old-school pinball action right all right well

247
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,080
before we turn into the pinball show we better get back on video there's nothing

248
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,800
wrong with there's a video screen in the background with the dot matrix but hey

249
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

250
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Um, it was okay.

251
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
I tried to play more games,

252
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
but unfortunately the wife has been

253
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
hogging the 360 and played Bejeweled.

254
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
This is so weird to hear

255
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
because the wife hates video games.

256
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah, yeah, so,

257
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
what'd I do yesterday? Yeah, I was playing

258
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
more New Super Mario Brothers

259
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
and I'm already getting tired of the game.

260
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
I'm already at, like, level

261
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
on level 4, I've actually

262
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
completely finished

263
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,940
one through three and gotten all the secret stuff and all that

264
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,460
uh...

265
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,060
i'm just kinda getting bored with it already

266
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,780
i don't know it's just not as good as some of the other games i guess

267
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:06,420
uh... then i've been playing trying to get through ghost recon i'm almost done with that

268
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,820
finally and then uh...

269
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,340
i don't know i've been trying a few other games i tried that uh...

270
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,480
what was it? jewel quest

271
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,500
that was okay

272
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,340
I don't know. I've already bought like almost every single live game or arcade game on there

273
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,100
except for like the crappy card games. Who wants crappy card games? I mean seriously.

274
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:35,640
Even if you don't like Uno. Uno's fun! I like Uno. Uno's fun, but like, you know, hard

275
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,640
with hearts, hard with backgammon, I mean, no. Lame. Um, but um, I don't know. It's just,

276
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,040
I haven't really gotten anything new. No new games coming out that I really want.

277
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,120
Hitman maybe. I really don't know though. I'm thinking

278
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,560
just waiting till July-August when some better games come out.

279
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,360
But I am... I have been to

280
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,520
get Jaws on my

281
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,760
PlayStation 2 hard drive so I can bust that game out because

282
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,840
I heard the game is so damn glitchy and stuff but it's worth trying because you can

283
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
play as a shark.

284
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,640
You know what though, with a concept like that, it might be cool to have a game as glitchy

285
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,200
as Driver 3.

286
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
It is.

287
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,520
It is as glitchy as Driver 3.

288
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,040
So that's kind of cool, you know, because Driver 3, that was what made it fun, is the

289
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,080
fact that it was so crappy.

290
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:38,320
It had the perfect balance of really shitty AI and gameplay with, you know, just an okay

291
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
game.

292
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,480
It wasn't so bad to where as you don't want to play it, but it wasn't, you know, so good

293
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,160
as where as you need to pick it up.

294
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,920
It's just equally awful, you know, across all levels.

295
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,080
So that game's really fun, especially if you can get it cheap, because it's so glitchy

296
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,580
you can literally play it for like an afternoon and just...

297
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
So it's like one of those...

298
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
It's like a B-movie.

299
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
It is.

300
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
It's like a bad B-movie.

301
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
It's like a showgirl.

302
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
It's so bad it's good.

303
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
Exactly.

304
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
Like Jaws 3D.

305
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Jaws on the console switch just came out. It's a cheap-ass game, it's like $29.99, but

306
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,660
just wait a couple of weeks. Once people buy it and say, hey, this game sucks, and then

307
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:25,140
they sell it back, get those copies for even cheaper. So that's what you need to do.

308
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,900
Alright. Anything else? Just a grant of thought, I will liberate these city stories again.

309
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,620
As usual. Yeah, we're going back to the team games,

310
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,260
have been doing free-for-alls and it's still fun because we just find new ways to kill

311
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:45,900
each other so it's it's still you know a highlight of the day all right um i should mention in

312
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,620
our chat room right now over at orange launcher.com click on chat if you are listening live here

313
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,260
on sunday night on our station uh it looks like dmn is in chat right now and he for whatever

314
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,340
reason has an extra zelda gamecube collector's disc burning a hole in his pocket you know

315
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,600
the one that had all the classic Zelda games on it, and he's just giving it away to a random

316
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,320
chatter right now. He's asking trivia questions and making a game out of it, and you know,

317
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,360
he's like, you guys cool with it? And I'm like, yeah, you know, I got ripped out of

318
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,680
the one that actually had the Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on there as well, I only got the one

319
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,920
with both of the Nintendo 64 ones. I might have an extra. You could enter DMN's contest

320
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,260
right now. I don't care, but I never played that one anyway, so, you know what, we need

321
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,220
to get we need to get one of those multiplayer pac-man games that was the

322
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,580
one on the GameCube remember oh pac-man vs right yeah I never did play that look

323
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,540
fun though all right um I want to go over to my gaming week because I

324
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,980
actually have quite a bit that I was playing this week in my personal life I

325
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,020
got jury duty this week and most people were telling me that jury duty you know

326
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,460
bring a book it's gonna be boring you're gonna sit there all day long and

327
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,820
nothing's gonna happen so I took my DS and yeah there was a lot of dead time

328
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,900
there but the rest of it didn't go how they said it would they said I would get

329
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,180
dismissed by the end of the day I actually got put on a jury for a trial

330
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,060
that's gonna last two weeks so I guess I'll be playing a lot of DS while I'm at

331
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,820
the gore house because there's a lot of down I mean we get like hour and a half

332
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,840
lunches and all this crazy stuff so I have DS to keep me busy I've been

333
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,580
playing Final Fantasy 1 which I realize is not a DS game but Extifer will like

334
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,940
keeps forgetting to loan me the new Super Mario Brothers cartridge that I

335
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,500
keep wanting to play and the only other game I had like ready available when I

336
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,140
left for the courthouse was Super Princess Peach and that game kind of I

337
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,580
don't know like I an action game isn't as easy to play at something like in

338
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,460
that type of situation so Final Fantasy I can get a little more out of so I've

339
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,380
been playing that again the dawn of souls it was on Game Boy Advance I'm

340
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,500
just using that in the Game Boy Advance slot and I lost my stylus though which

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,540
me off, not that I need it for Final Fantasy I, but I just thought I'd throw that in there.

342
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,180
But Final Fantasy I, of course, if you haven't played it before, the one on the Game Boy

343
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,340
Advance, they really souped it up from the NES, it's not as frustrating because they

344
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,380
switched the battle system to more like Final Fantasy IV, where if your whole party attacks

345
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,500
one monster and it dies, it doesn't end up being wasted attacks, it will attack a different

346
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
monster.

347
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,540
I know that was one really frustrating thing about Final Fantasy I on the NES, but that

348
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,780
That kind of adds to the strategy element, I suppose, but that is different.

349
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:30,100
I also got a chance to play something new, 2DX Red, Beatmania 2DX RED, or 11, and this

350
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
is the import game.

351
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
It's not here in America.

352
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,540
You do have to import it from Japan, and of course, if you know Beatmania in the US, then

353
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:45,060
I'm sure you have heard of the Japanese series that spawned it, and now it's up to its 11th

354
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,780
version game, thirteenth arcade game. The things I like about 2DX Red, the interface

355
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,120
is great, it's slick, it's got an awesome interface, it's a customizable interface.

356
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,480
One of the things you unlock, you don't really unlock songs in 2DX anymore, you unlock either

357
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,900
gallery art or you unlock customization pieces. So you can actually change the picture that's

358
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,700
on the turntable, the bar that is falling down during the parts of the song, what the

359
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,120
notes look like when they explode when you hit the buttons or you can change

360
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
the whole damn

361
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,360
like skin around it now you'd you know there's only like ten or I don't know

362
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,240
not even that many probably like seven or so preset ones so you don't have total

363
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,120
freedom but it's still pretty cool because you can mix and match and kind of

364
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,880
make the game your own a little bit so I thought that was kind of a neat addition

365
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,960
uh... and something fun to unlock there

366
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,640
uh... my other my only real problem with Beatmania 2DX Red is that I'm not

367
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,800
a fan of the songs as much as previous styles

368
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,480
there's some really good songs but like overall I think I prefer like 9th, 7th

369
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,240
you know kinda going back to some of the older styles

370
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,320
but they did bring back some good older songs

371
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
except V isn't one of them

372
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,600
V is this song that has been in like every Beatmania 2DX game in Japan

373
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,480
since 5th Style, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th

374
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,120
it is not in 11th

375
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,920
they finally gave it a rest for a little while

376
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,200
yeah until they come up with the next you know

377
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,680
was it 2DX 14 or whatever and it's gonna be V2 or something like that

378
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,140
or VV or something. It'll be H, it'll be Handel.

379
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,820
We'll see. The other part that I

380
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,220
I love about 2DX Red is rival data because Miklotov is the one that brought

381
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,500
it

382
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,780
to the house here so I had a chance to play it and I

383
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,820
started playing on my memory card. Well I was able to put in his memory card and

384
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,420
load his scores

385
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,940
onto my card. So what that would do is it would show me, hey,

386
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,340
these are the songs you're doing better than Miklotov at and these are the songs you

387
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,660
need to improve on if you want to be better than Miklotov.

388
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,240
and you can, I think, load up to five people. And the other cool thing is you

389
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,300
can do rival data against yourself,

390
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,660
essentially. If you go into the options and you go like all the way down to the

391
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,220
bottom and you see this little turntable, you can change it so that

392
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,500
if you're playing one player, you know how usually in Beatmania the right side of

393
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,900
the screen, if you're playing left or vice versa, if you're a

394
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,860
player two side person, the left side is just blank. Nothing happens there.

395
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,420
What will happen instead is that that'll be replaced by a bar graph

396
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,580
that goes up showing you how your combo compares to the last game that you

397
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,020
played

398
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,340
I'm sorry, not your combo, but your Beatmania points. You get plus two for a

399
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,020
flashing grate, plus one for a grate

400
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,220
it kinda shows that in bar graph. Very similar to keyboard mania. If you've ever played

401
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,540
keyboard mania, it's almost like they stole it from keyboard mania.

402
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,020
So, huh?

403
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,540
Alright, so rival data is pretty cool and it kinda gives you

404
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,980
incentive to keep playing because I have to be better than Miklotov, so that's 2DX Red.

405
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,380
I definitely recommend it to music games fans that have a Japanese PlayStation 2.

406
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,140
Those you guys that don't have a Japanese PlayStation 2, let's hope that

407
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,700
Konami of America releases a Beatmania 2 here in the US

408
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,700
and that they'll use this game's interface to model it off of,

409
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,300
and I think that would happen and that would be pretty sweet.

410
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,460
Another Japanese game I checked out this week is R2 Beat

411
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,420
and this is a game that was at E3 and it was a racing game

412
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,420
but it's a music game as well. It's a music racing game.

413
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,940
So those you guys that say that the music game

414
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,980
idea is dead and that all the music games are the same and the guitar heroes are the same

415
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,580
game as Beatmania and da da da da da,

416
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,940
you need to play R2B because R2B is a real creative idea for a music game.

417
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,380
I really like it because it gets into the kind of competitive nature a little

418
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,540
more, like some of the

419
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,060
songs are very competitive. So if you want to check this out,

420
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,060
One of our listeners has a website that's all about this game, and you're going to

421
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,820
have to follow the directions on the forums of this website to be able to play the game

422
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,500
because it's all in Japanese.

423
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,480
So unless you read and understand Japanese fluently, you're not going to really be able

424
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,340
to play the game unless you use some of the translation guides at this site mixed with

425
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
Google translation.

426
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,060
I'm going to give out the site address real fast.

427
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,100
It's djmaxus.bamanistyle.com.

428
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,620
And really the website is dedicated to DJ Maxx, which is another game, but R2Beat, go

429
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,740
to the forums and there's more information on this R2Beat.

430
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,040
It kind of makes me think of like a Mario Kart rhythm game, because in one of the modes

431
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,020
you can use items on other players, and it's pretty creative, some of the items they come

432
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
up with.

433
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,500
Like one of them will send out this giant King Kong type thing onto the race track that

434
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,940
will beat the race track so that your screen shakes, so it's really hard to see the notes

435
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,660
as they're coming down.

436
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,800
Another item will throw headphones onto your opponent's head that will change the song

437
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,180
completely that they're hearing, so that the beats won't match up or anything, makes it

438
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,960
very difficult for a couple measures.

439
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,180
So it's kind of fun, so that's kind of where I get the Mario Kart thing, because the items

440
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,240
really add a whole different flair to it.

441
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,180
So the pros about this game, it's free, graphically it's pretty kick-butt, I was given a tip,

442
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,960
you can actually use Alt-Enter to play the game in a window if you don't like it taking

443
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,560
up your whole screen, and it's a real kind of clever music game.

444
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,580
The only cons that I really saw is that it's got a really steep learning curve

445
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,300
because of the fact that the game's not in English, so you really have to be

446
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,380
patient if you want to learn this game.

447
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,360
You'll get frustrated with it very easy if the language barrier is going to be a

448
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
problem for you.

449
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,680
But I force myself to kind of get through the tutorial and everything and

450
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,760
it's not so bad. You can figure it out. Use common sense, you'll figure out how to

451
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,320
play the game.

452
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,040
So I like it. I think you guys should check it out if you get a chance if you

453
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
like music games because it's free.

454
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,740
I don't know if this is the type of game I would pay money for, just because it seems

455
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,560
like the type of game I'll only play for a little while, even though it does offer some

456
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,900
kind of customization, like you can change your hair, change your clothes.

457
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,100
I don't really see myself playing this the long term, but I don't know.

458
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,820
They do have the fact that they can expand with different songs, and they can expand

459
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
the game later.

460
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,900
I think what would be neat, and I think this is the way the company that hosts this game

461
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,300
has it set up. I think

462
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,260
it's part of a network of a bunch of other different kinds of games

463
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,980
and I think in that way it'll be great. It's actually part of a network called

464
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,100
gamechoo.jp

465
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,660
that's their website gamechoo.jp

466
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,180
and I think I would really enjoy this game like it's a part of

467
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,740
a selection of games from a website so

468
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,300
check it out if you guys wanna see a crazy looking

469
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,340
game. Other than that, just a buffet of Xbox Live Arcade games and some Rockstar

470
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,020
Table Tennis.

471
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,040
That's all for me. Alright, let's get into some gaming news

472
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,620
here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to start off tonight with

473
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,300
Loki, I think. Yes, and basically

474
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,380
the story to start things off is about

475
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,420
the DS Lite and how some stores just don't get street dates.

476
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,740
One of those store chains being Target,

477
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,660
The other one being Walmart and basically, you know, the shipments of these new systems

478
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,940
have already come in to pretty much everybody.

479
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,700
In fact, I mean, my company that I work at, they actually have them right now.

480
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,060
Of course, you know, like most things, you're not supposed to sell it until street date,

481
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,620
you know, to basically either make it, you know, fair for everybody, you know, so that

482
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,660
one person doesn't have it sooner than the other and that type of thing.

483
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,460
But you know, companies don't realize this or either just ignore it.

484
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,620
And so, you know, in the case of like certain Targets and Walmarts, just went ahead and

485
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,100
sold it the day they got them.

486
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,100
So people have already been picking them up, put them on eBay and whatnot.

487
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,220
So basically if you're lucky enough to find one, more power to you.

488
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,620
Which is ridiculous since you can just order them online from Japan.

489
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Exactly.

490
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
It doesn't matter anyways.

491
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,620
For almost the same price.

492
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,620
I mean they're really coming out in about a week.

493
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,620
Yeah.

494
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Just wait.

495
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,700
And by the way, this is not the first time Targets broke a street date.

496
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Oh no.

497
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
No.

498
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
They've done like, you know, Katamari and stuff.

499
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Yeah, We Heart Katamari, I remember when it was called the Target.

500
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Yeah, and you know what?

501
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,700
These companies, you know, they think that they're getting away with this shit.

502
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
You know, Nintendo will know.

503
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
I mean, it's just like, you know, Namco.

504
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Namco was aware of the problem with We Heart Katamari.

505
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Or not We Heart Katamari. Yeah, We Heart Katamari.

506
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,700
And they basically, you know, those stores will not be getting their product on time.

507
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
Or they'll be getting it at the day of, or whatever.

508
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
They won't get it early anymore.

509
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,380
that's not a good thing to do to piss off the Nintendo right before the Wii launch

510
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,580
because uh you know if they don't have it people are going other places so

511
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,980
it's not good for them yeah that's what they did with GameStop and stuff when

512
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,760
GameStop didn't have the pre-orders people went to Best Buy who didn't do

513
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,180
pre-orders and tried to

514
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,820
you know get it that way so yeah so I mean

515
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,900
if you can find them really great to be honest it's just a redesign of the damn console

516
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,420
I mean

517
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,380
do you really need one right away you don't

518
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I actually don't think they're any more comfortable to play than

519
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,740
the US ones anyway because of that sharp edge.

520
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,300
Um, DarkSakura, do you have any news about the colors

521
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,700
of the systems that we're seeing? Well actually, in Europe

522
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,700
they're getting two colors. They're getting black and

523
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,740
white. Pretty

524
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,180
monochrome there. Now that's interesting because we're only getting white.

525
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,380
They get black because they're special I guess I guess getting screwed on the price finally

526
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,460
Karma pays off for them because they always get screwed on prices their price actually

527
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,680
It's gonna be out on June 23rd in Europe their prices 99.99

528
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,020
Pounds or a 149.99 euro

529
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Also as far as some games that they're getting on June 30th

530
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,420
the new Super Mario Brothers will be out, Brain Training is on June 9th,

531
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,780
Nintendogs Dalmatian and Friends is on June 16th.

532
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,300
I'm getting a Dalmatian one, which is,

533
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,340
actually I would be jealous if I even played my Nintendogs anymore, sorry.

534
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,020
Alright, now VidPowah in our chat room reminds us that there actually is a

535
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,180
Frapper map.

536
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,700
Orange House Radio has a Frapper map too, so if you're on Frapper, F-R-A-P-P-R dot com,

537
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,300
look us up.

538
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,020
but you can also look up dslightavailability, just cram that all together into one word,

539
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,300
and they're actually checking targets to see if any have the dslight.

540
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:02,060
I already looked in this area and there are none, because I kind of want one, but I don't know,

541
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,060
we'll see, we'll see. All right, moving on with more news.

542
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:16,060
Yes, in other news, also Nintendo related, we've got information that the Wii is not going to have

543
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:22,780
doubly digital out, at least no 5.1 surround sound. They will have Pro Logic, which is

544
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,020
still good, but I mean, I don't know, I don't think you really need it since they're not

545
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,580
going to be doing HD anyways, so, you know, big deal. I don't know a lot of people out

546
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,880
there, especially if you just have a standard TV setup, you're not going to have a surround

547
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,940
sound either, so, you know, the Pro Logic works just as well, so I don't think that's

548
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,940
a big deal. Not really a huge surprise either, but still, interesting information.

549
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,800
I guess, I don't know, I don't have Dolby Digital in my house anyway, so I don't care,

550
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,600
but I'm sure there's some people that will be kind of, hmm, but...

551
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,120
Well, I'm kind of, I have Dolby Digital in my house.

552
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Okay, well, literally, I mean, who, okay, so you have it in your house, okay, that's

553
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,280
That's great, but you have a Prologic setup on yours, so it sounds great.

554
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
It sounds fine.

555
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,240
My receiver also has Prologic.

556
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,560
It's not going to be the end of the world.

557
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,940
They're not supporting HD, I should say true HD or whatever anyway, so as long as the games

558
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,320
are fun, I'm not going to worry too much about the sound.

559
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,660
Plus we already know there's a speaker in the controller, which is kind of, can't really

560
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,800
get that, 5.1 or not, digital 5.1, whatever.

561
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,300
You don't have the speaker and the controller, so I'm willing to forgive them as long as

562
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
the games are still fun.

563
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,140
I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.

564
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:48,020
And to be honest, the Xbox 360 does not have optical digital audio out either.

565
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,380
Is PlayStation 3 looking at it?

566
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Is that another thing?

567
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:56,060
PlayStation 2 had optical digital audio out, so I wouldn't imagine that PlayStation 3 does

568
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
as well.

569
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,300
Then again, that could be on one of those lists of things that they've scrapped for

570
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,580
price point I don't know I'm gonna be honest I don't know a lot about audio

571
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,700
setups this whole you know the different types kind of go over my head a little

572
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,740
bit so it's interesting all right moving on we're gonna go to a story now about

573
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,980
Sony and it kind of has to do with Nintendo because you know when Sony

574
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,940
announced that tilt thing at e3 everybody said they stole the concept of

575
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,780
the Wii they just are stealing from Nintendo well Sony Computer

576
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,880
Entertainment Europe's Phil Harrison is a little pissed off that people would

577
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,320
jump and say this.

578
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,760
He said, ï¿½In a way, I understand why people say that we stole Nintendoï¿½s idea, but it

579
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
is a little stupid if you forgive the remark.

580
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,040
When we brought the PlayStation to the market in 1994, we introduced real-time 3D graphics

581
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,460
for the first time.

582
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,120
When Nintendo launched its Nintendo 64 in 1996, it also had 3D graphics.

583
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,280
Did we say Nintendo stole our idea?

584
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Obviously not.ï¿½

585
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,720
No, of course not, because that whole PlayStation is supposed to be a CD drive for the Super

586
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Nintendo.

587
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,280
It was built for Nintendo in the first place.

588
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,160
All you do is put an operating system on it.

589
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Way to go, jackass.

590
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,480
And there was Star Fox, and as far as there were games on the PC Engine Duo that had 3D.

591
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Exactly.

592
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,520
So they are pretty much full of crap.

593
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,640
Well I'm surprised he's not actually researching it.

594
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,960
I've got two questions.

595
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,160
First, did Sony steal Nintendo's idea, why or why not?

596
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
I say no.

597
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Okay.

598
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,320
I think they did something to make themselves competitive in that aspect, but I don't think

599
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,240
stole the idea. How easy would it have been to just come out with a controller? It was

600
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,120
the same thing. They tried something a little bit different, and although I'm not the biggest

601
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,840
fan of the idea, I wouldn't say they stole it. I think they just kind of tried to do

602
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:45,840
something a little competitive. I don't know. You guys' thoughts. DarkSakura, any?

603
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:52,320
I really, the whole debate I think is ridiculous. It's over and done with. The item is coming

604
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,040
out. There's nothing that can be done about it. To say one stole from the other, I'm putting

605
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,880
that in the frame of pointless argument, there's really no point.

606
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,520
Did they steal the idea of putting out a console? I mean... I don't really care, honestly.

607
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,240
I mean, because

608
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,120
it's moot. The system's been out since, like, I was in high school.

609
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,800
You know, who's gonna talk about who stole what from the Super...

610
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,280
you know, from the Super Nintendo having been out? You know,

611
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,640
company... it's business. Companies steal from each other

612
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,960
all the time. I was gonna say, when... remember when Vanilla Coke came out? Because we all loved

613
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,420
vanilla Coke at the time when it first came out.

614
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,040
Then vanilla Pepsi was a better product.

615
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,820
Vanilla Pepsi came out like two months later.

616
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,060
Is Pepsi a bunch of thieves?

617
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,060
No, that's what they do.

618
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,740
They always copy each other, you know?

619
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,260
It's the point of business to find out other businesses trade secrets and cash in on it.

620
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,900
Loki, you have a thought?

621
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Yeah, okay.

622
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,140
So they say, we didn't copy the way it's been in production for two years.

623
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:50,200
Two years ago, there was a game put out on Game of Advance called WarioWare Twisted.

624
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,060
had the same kind of technology in there that's in the controller. So, fuck you Sony, you're

625
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:03,120
still copying somebody. First off, you got your facts wrong anyway, so it doesn't matter.

626
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,660
So they copied it, great, whatever. They've copied controller designs with the analog

627
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:18,080
sticks and stuff from Nintendo 64, rumble from Nintendo 64, big deal. Xbox Live, they're

628
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,860
They're going to be copying that for the Playstation 3 online service or whatever.

629
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,320
It's what people like and so obviously you have to put it in your console.

630
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,740
But don't try to pass it off as this is an original idea that you came up with.

631
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,300
Basically say, yeah our competitions do it, we need to do this in order to be competitive.

632
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,100
That's all you got to say.

633
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
That is it.

634
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Pretty simple.

635
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,060
Instead of being a jackass going, we came up with it first, no I don't think so.

636
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,780
So you know what, great.

637
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,720
If it works for your console, awesome.

638
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,980
I think it's going to be stupid and, you know, if they're going to be taking out the rumble

639
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,540
feature for this, I think it's a really bad trade-off.

640
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,460
Alright, I gotta go to our chat room with some comments because they're lit up right

641
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,460
now a little bit.

642
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,340
Umm, for, spiritsnarrow would like to point out, Pepsi Blue came out but Coke Blue never

643
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
did.

644
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,660
That's because Pepsi Blue was kinda crappy.

645
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,060
It was like Windex.

646
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
I didn't like it at all.

647
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,740
Yeah, it tastes like Windex and it made your poo change colors.

648
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,100
I thank you for sharing.

649
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,980
What else is there here?

650
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:23,980
O2G said, maybe if they didn't implement it at the last minute.

651
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,420
Do you think maybe the whole last minute implementation of this is what makes them look like they're

652
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,420
thieving here?

653
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Yeah, it does.

654
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,660
And if they were saying that, oh yeah, this is something we're thinking about or something

655
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,580
like that, that would be a little different, you know, that was something they were toying

656
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
around with.

657
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,060
But the fact that they brought it in, I mean, so what if they've been working on it for

658
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,060
two years?

659
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
We haven't heard anything about it.

660
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,940
You haven't seen anything until two weeks before E3.

661
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
That's a little fishy.

662
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,460
Just so you know, according to an article that appeared in MCV, Sony Computer Entertainment

663
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,380
Europe, President and CEO David Reeve said, the DualShock 3 pad was not a last minute

664
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,820
thing, but it's been in development for over two years.

665
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:09,340
That's what I said, two years, and WarioWare came out, what, two years ago with the same

666
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,860
type of tilt feature.

667
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
Great.

668
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,820
didnÃ­t steal from the Wii, but you stole from something else. You know, when the hell

669
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,460
are they going to come out with something original? I mean, really, when are they going

670
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,940
to come out with something original? TheyÃ­re like one step behind everybody.

671
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,020
Okay, this takes me to my second question. WhatÃ­s with all the Sony hate on this show

672
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,220
lately? I donÃ­t know.

673
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,780
I donÃ­t know if they put out a good product, Fiddler on Our Love.

674
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:34,300
Seriously, the Playstation 2, I was out there first day, I bought it at launch, regardless

675
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,380
of what games came out, but there were games I liked that came out at launch. The Armored

676
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,120
Core at the time was one of the ones that I bought and it was great. I loved the game

677
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,840
and the fact that the backwards compatibility was good and the price point wasn't outrageous

678
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,240
and that type of stuff. But their system right now, they don't have a great lineup of games

679
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,760
coming out. Granted, okay, the system may be cool, but it's pumping out the same kind

680
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,280
of graphics, same kind of game plays you're going to be getting on the Xbox 360, but it's

681
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,800
more expensive. And because they think that they need a Blu-ray driving there because

682
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:12,780
are really trying to push this whole HD movie format on me. I don't want to pay the extra

683
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:19,240
$200 for this thing when I've just a few years ago replaced all my VHS with DVDs. Now they

684
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,220
want me to do this again? Why? I don't own an HDTV that's going to benefit from this

685
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,740
so why should I have to spend the extra $200 for it? Plus they came out a year later. Plus

686
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,700
they're doing all these unoriginal ideas. You know what? If they do come out with some

687
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,400
really good games, like maybe a new Twisted Metal or something like that, that'd be great.

688
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,320
But the whole thing, I mean, Sony's a great company and all, but even after the PSP came

689
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,140
out and the launch games for that, the launch games were pitiful for the PSP. They were

690
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,780
all just rehashed, you know what, Twisted Metal head on, that's Twisted Metal 2, all

691
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,900
over again. Luminous being a glaring exception though. Well yeah, but that's a third party

692
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,560
company though, that's a third party, I mean that game could have been made on, you know,

693
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,180
the original PlayStation 2. I mean, it's not something that really needed the PlayStation

694
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,660
portable. And, you know, I'm not like picking on Sony just because, you know, oh, I'm pro

695
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,780
Microsoft or something like that. Granted, Microsoft, I mean, they haven't, how many

696
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,420
games has Microsoft come out with in the last, you know, few months? What, we had three,

697
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,740
you know, in May, one in June. I mean, where the hell are all the games? That's, you know,

698
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,420
something that we should be talking about also.

699
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,340
All right. Let me interject here with some comments from chat, although some folks in

700
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,820
are cheering you on there, Boy Wonder Zero and Hentairini.

701
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,320
FunnyDale is mentioning, if anyone should sue anyone,

702
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,020
it should be Ralph Baer. He was the guy who invented the idea for a home video

703
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,020
game console and got almost nothing out of it himself.

704
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,620
Interesting thought.

705
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,580
I'll phrase a question towards DarkSakura, because I know you have not

706
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,300
been a fan of Sony's PlayStation 3 stuff lately.

707
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,740
What could Sony do

708
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,200
to win you over

709
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,980
and you would be rah rah rah about this console on launch day?

710
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,940
What could they do between now and launch day to win you back?

711
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,580
Do we have time for me to list it?

712
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,700
Sure, take a couple if you've got it.

713
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,640
Well, okay. First of all, drop the price.

714
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,400
Take out all of the unnecessary shit.

715
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,760
Take out the gyroscope. We don't fucking need it.

716
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,300
You know, we don't need high def that not every system is going to be able to manage.

717
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,900
We don't need two HDMI ports. Maybe one HDMI port.

718
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,820
You know, enough to, you know, because how many people are going to hook up two HDMI ports?

719
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,820
I think they only have one now. They did scale it back to one.

720
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,860
Okay good. Leaving the HDMI. Allow me to point out that the low-end system will not even

721
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,100
have the HDMI at all.

722
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,140
I know this. I wouldn't waste my money on a

723
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,460
low-end system. But they need to

724
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,500
you know the memory stick thing? It's nice

725
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,700
but they should have made them use the memory sticks from the beginning

726
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,620
or a USB thing you know they should have had something

727
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,020
more universal that would last if their vision was that big they should have had

728
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,260
it last from system to system

729
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,140
or they should at very least use the PS2 memory cards you know

730
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,300
there's price reduction right there. They don't need

731
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,280
to process the polys that they're saying that they can

732
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,460
no one is really gonna care you know they need to make sure

733
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,500
the games they put on there first of all take care of the whole

734
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,620
anti-aliasing issue that you've had ever since the days of the PS1

735
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,220
you know fix that you know

736
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Oh God, I've got such a list in my head right now.

737
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,820
That's right, Loki wouldn't interject anyway.

738
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,120
There is something else I like about the PlayStation 2.

739
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,420
The old controllers worked on the system.

740
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,220
I bought the system, I spent the $300 or whatever,

741
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,920
and I did not have to go out and buy new hookups.

742
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,220
It used the same hookups as the PlayStation 1.

743
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,120
I didn't have to buy new controllers.

744
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,520
You know, granted it came with one, but I didn't have to go out and buy a second one.

745
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,920
You know, to play two-player games.

746
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,420
I had that already because I already owned the system.

747
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,120
Granted, Devil's Advocate, Xbox 360 didn't do that for you.

748
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
No, it didn't.

749
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,480
Yeah, you can use your Xbox controllers. No, you can't, no.

750
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,440
Because it's USB. You have a 360 USB. That's right, that's right.

751
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,560
Okay, that's great though. That's what I liked about it. I didn't say they'd have to do that

752
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,560
for the PlayStation 3, but it just...

753
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,860
First thing they need to do, stop doing gimmicky shit.

754
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,920
I mean, granted I can say that about Nintendo too, but Nintendo at least is trying

755
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,480
things that

756
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,520
could possibly work. Whereas, like for example, F1 racing for

757
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,000
the PS3 has used the wing mirror basically as the PSP.

758
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,920
is a wing mirror you don't need that that is a stupid example of the

759
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,800
technology

760
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,720
stupid. I'm going to ask one more question then I want to get back to the news because we

761
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,740
spent an awful lot of time on this unplanned Sony discussion but here's

762
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,960
here's my last thought. Should

763
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,120
Sony push back the release of this to save themselves yes or no?

764
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,960
They're going to have to I think. Just right now given the level of technology

765
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,220
they're trying to fit into that

766
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:50,140
little box that they had as a demo. I mean, they were obviously running off of the right

767
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,380
mounted servers. How are they going to fit that in there without having serious cooling

768
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,880
issues?

769
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,540
Are they done for if they push it back? Should they not even...

770
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:03,840
They've already screwed themselves. Pushing them back. Honestly, I don't know if it will

771
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,540
hurt or help them because they have already screwed themselves over.

772
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,240
Alright, Loki?

773
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,100
I think it's going to be a big mistake if they don't push it out by Christmas and the

774
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,500
The reason why is because you've got the strong Xbox third quarter, or fourth quarter, basically

775
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:23,900
all these big name games, the must have killer app games, Forza 2, Gears of War, and just

776
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,260
a lot of really big stuff that's coming out for the 360.

777
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,880
If you delay it any further, like into spring, people are already going to be snapping up

778
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,620
the Xbox 360 and they'll say to hell with the PS3.

779
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,500
Although, if they do launch PS3 now, you're going to get a lot of unfinished games, you're

780
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,860
going to get a lot of things that may not work right, and it's going to be one big clusterfuck.

781
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,940
It's going to be kind of like the Xbox 360 launch was, you know, to a greater extent

782
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,940
though.

783
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,060
And, I don't know, we'll have to see if maybe they've been, you know, playing it down that

784
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,660
they really are, you know, ready to launch this thing, but I don't know.

785
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,420
Alright, I'm going to run down some quick chat comments here in our chatroom, orangeonstrader.com,

786
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,420
click on chat.

787
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:09,660
28 says ps3 in 2006 I'll eat my hat if that happens let's see Legend of Zaku

788
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,340
says they need it to live or Nintendo will eat them alive Boy Wonder Zero says

789
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:20,020
they can't do it bandit says this the PlayStation 3 is to next gen for this

790
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:28,220
gen hmm and Sakurina says recap fuck next generation consoles go retro okay

791
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,500
well I guess that the Dreamcast is having a resurgence from what I

792
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,260
But anyway, we need to get back into some more news here, so let's keep it on moving

793
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,260
here.

794
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,980
Loki, you have some news on the Wii.

795
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:45,260
Yes, also basically one of the big things about the Wii was that this Wii Connect 24

796
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,100
service that they're going to be having, they'll basically allow you to have updates.

797
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,060
Some of the things that they're talking about is daily content, and this can be anything

798
00:44:53,060 --> 00:45:00,460
from DS demos to movies, etc.

799
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:06,000
basically new content each day for you. I think that's great. I don't think that's going

800
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,240
to happen. That's maybe a bit optimistic, but definitely I like the idea of having DS

801
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,240
demos on there so you can actually play that. That's pretty cool. That's something that

802
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,720
Sony should copy, to be honest. I mean, PS3 downloadable demos, that'd be a really good

803
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,720
thing.

804
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,360
So hopefully, the other thing though is, I mean, granted there's only limited storage

805
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,600
on this thing, hopefully they'll have some way to turn this off in case you don't want

806
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,700
it because it's going to fill up your hard drive or flash memory pretty quick.

807
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,660
Alright, now there's another console to consider in the whole next generation wars that we've

808
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,100
kind of forgot about it.

809
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,600
It kind of hasn't been there, right DarkSakura?

810
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,920
Forgetting about it, we should still forget about it, I'm surprised this is even still

811
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
being considered.

812
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,920
Infinium is saying the Phantom is still going to launch.

813
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,000
are still moving forward in development, that's a quote, and they are licensing to PC manufacturers

814
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
right now.

815
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,480
And we set up our launch title as Duke Nukem Forever.

816
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Might sell some systems.

817
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,120
But it's supposed to be actually an on-demand game service to deliver the games to the system

818
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,960
in the living room through online means.

819
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,280
So correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like GameTap on your TV, in a way, but not with

820
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,080
classic titles, but with new games.

821
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,280
That's what it's looking like.

822
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
Huh.

823
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,200
But they've changed their launch date now from mid-2006 to October.

824
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,600
Their new CEO is basically going in saying that they're really pushing it.

825
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:44,900
They're trying to get the Phantom lap board out, which is a combination keyboard and mouse.

826
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,060
And they're saying it's on schedule for first arrivals in October for the U.S. market.

827
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:55,020
right now they're running at uh... seventy million dollar loss

828
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,380
you know maybe the product created maybe this is why nintendo's afraid to

829
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,260
announce the launch date for the week as they're shaking in their boots over this

830
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,460
phantom launch i mean this is that's a hell of a split

831
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,560
no i know

832
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,660
here's what they needed to do with the phantom

833
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,420
if you really want to put this out and actually be successful with it and

834
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,820
you're talking about on-demand service why don't you do like pitch it

835
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,660
to cable companies cable companies now are starting to do this you know

836
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:24,380
on-demand crap where you can download movies and karaoke and stuff like that

837
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,460
why not games?

838
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,460
Just, you know, soup up their hardware right now and offer games

839
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,980
where you can download them on-demand play. Hey, you want to know something weird?

840
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,860
Cable companies did this in the eighties and I don't know if it was something that was just

841
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,580
being tested locally in this market but my cable box back in like

842
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,280
back when the only system we had was like the Atari 2600 this is before the

843
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,440
launch of the NES, we were talking about that long ago

844
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,920
you could get games on demand like poker and stuff that had better graphics

845
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,760
entire choice is hundred

846
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,920
and use your remote and that never for some reason I never took off I don't

847
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,160
know

848
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,960
remember the Satellaview? No, I didn't have that. Well the Satellaview is what they had in

849
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,720
Japan for the Super Nintendo. Oh, okay. The Zelda Satellaview which is actually

850
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,240
in my opinion the best version of the first Zelda game ever.

851
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,960
I remember back in the day when they had the Sega channel and that was okay

852
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,760
but it was slow as hell. Nowadays though with everything being broadband I think they

853
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,400
should do that. They do this in hotel rooms right now too.

854
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,840
Oh yeah, I see chat rooms. They have Xbox Arcade.

855
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,640
It's the same difference.

856
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,840
But I think that's something that they should really do because in that way, you know,

857
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,240
I don't want to buy a game console but you know maybe this game service where

858
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,600
GameTap should fucking go in the business with these people and you know

859
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,280
I think that'd be good too but I don't know.

860
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,200
It's really where they need to be going because the Phantom console has like a PC

861
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,320
on-demand thing

862
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,440
people have done it for cheaper and better so

863
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,640
yeah. Alright, well let's keep it moving here. I want to talk about the ESRB for a

864
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,080
minute

865
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,520
Penny Arcade is actually teaming up with ESRB. This is kind of interesting

866
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,520
Gabe from Penny Arcade wrote that they have been signed by the ESRB to put

867
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,880
together a new advertising campaign

868
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,560
meant to educate gamers about the ESRB's rating systems. It's going to show up in

869
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,840
magazines and websites and all that stuff

870
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,920
Um, I think that's kind of interesting. I like...

871
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,160
Penny Arcade has a very funny approach to social issues sometimes, so I'll be very

872
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,400
curious to see what they come up with for this ESRB. I think it'll be very

873
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,360
creative.

874
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,560
There's some very creative guys over there. Well, you remember they actually had a kind of

875
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,280
little thing teasing at it at E3. You probably saw those, um,

876
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,240
pillars that they had with the characters. So, I think

877
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,280
any way to get the message out there is great. I mean, especially if,

878
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,960
you know it's something that you know parents can be able to use and so there's

879
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,680
less confusion on

880
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,080
the ratings. Because I remember they have that kind of like movie theaters, you know the little cartoon

881
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,160
thing showing what each

882
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,400
you know rating means and stuff. Right. I think that would be

883
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,040
a pretty good thing. Or even like you know TV commercials, how they have like TV

884
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,280
commercials talking about the TV ratings.

885
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,520
Probably a good thing. Blaze would like to point out in her chat room the gamers understand

886
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,200
how the ESRB works is the parents that need to be educated.

887
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,400
Yeah. So let's hope whatever they're working on is you know kind of

888
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,120
geared towards parents but I would say if it's educated if it's aimed at

889
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,120
gamers talking to parents about what they're playing I think that's not a bad

890
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,160
thing either but I don't know that would be kind of a hard thing to market but

891
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,520
you know at Penny Arcade they're creative they can come up with something

892
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,920
I'm sure moving on let's go on over to Loki who has news on another video game

893
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,880
law yep and this one's in it's been passed in Minnesota their last latest

894
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,640
state law is basically finding, and this is interesting, finding the people that buy the

895
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,640
game and not the sellers of the games. So basically if you're a miner and you live in

896
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,200
Minnesota and you happen to purchase an emirated game, well the blame is going to fall in your

897
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,200
hands. You're going to be fined $25 for that.

898
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
That's smart.

899
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
I think it's a great idea.

900
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,640
That's the right approach to take because really whose responsibility is it? It's the

901
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,800
person who's paying out the money, they want the product, the game retailer, why should

902
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,600
they parent other people's children for them?

903
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,160
So I'm fully in support of that.

904
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,680
Basically they're saying that they're not trying to punish gamers and basically if you

905
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,200
do get caught doing this and get fined, it would not go on your record, it's just you'd

906
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,120
be fined $25.

907
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,880
The other thing though is they're saying that they don't know how they're going to enforce

908
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,900
it, which is, I don't know, it's interesting, I think it's the right approach to punish

909
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:36,660
the people buying the games, or maybe even the parents, you know, because, I don't know,

910
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,980
maybe the fine should be, well, I don't know if it's a little bit too, you know, the right

911
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,340
price point or not, maybe a little bit higher of a fine would be a bit better, but I guess

912
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:50,100
it's sort of a step in the right direction, instead of, you know, just trying to say,

913
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,220
oh, let's ban all bad video games type thing.

914
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:59,820
Alright, speaking of bad things and games doing bad things to children, an affiliate

915
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:07,100
of Fox, a Fox 9 TV station, further proving that the media does not get games sometimes.

916
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:12,720
They ran a story recently that talked about how children are using a game device to access

917
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,020
porn out of thin air.

918
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:19,780
The gaming device in question, the PSP, and of course, if you consider that the PSP can

919
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,940
access the internet and that if you listen to Avenue Q, the internet is for porn, this

920
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,880
does not make any surprise at all that you can download porn on your PSP.

921
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,100
This kind of reminds me of that other story that ran out that long ago about how you know

922
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:38,420
predators can pick up children in PictoChat whereas I never find people chatting in PictoChat.

923
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,460
This is just kind of one of those, is this really news?

924
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:46,660
I mean if you really understand that the PSP gets on the internet and you can get anything

925
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,760
on the internet, you probably can't just get porn pictures on the internet.

926
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,300
You could get crazy stuff, pictures too.

927
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,980
You could get Tub Girl on the PSP if you really wanted it, although I hope you don't want

928
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,300
download that crap

929
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,820
yeah right

930
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,020
so whatever media

931
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,460
stop trying to

932
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,580
sell all that

933
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,300
sensationalist stuff fair and balanced

934
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,940
well you know what it's easy to blame fox and use that whole thing but really

935
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,220
uh...

936
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,780
i think there's a lot of uneducated media folks out there in general i think

937
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,740
it's easy to pick on fox in this case but my favorite though was the uh...

938
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,760
penny arcade response to the whole thing over there with a calculator the edge

939
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,300
There's a sketch in the calculator.

940
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,900
Your calculator can say boobs, which is something else.

941
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,420
Speaking of porn, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down all day long for

942
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,420
porn.

943
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,420
Hey!

944
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,500
But once in a while she stumbles upon a site she wants to share with you in a little segment

945
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,180
we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

946
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,100
DarkSakura, where should the kids be surfing to this week?

947
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,220
Today's Website of the Week is, I actually had one and then there was another one that

948
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,180
I have found earlier that I'm going to stick with because of the article I found on it.

949
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,620
It's at Livescience.com. If you're going to this URL, it's Livescience.com slash technology

950
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:13,100
slash 050201 underscore cell underscore danger dot HTML. Basically, it's talking about how

951
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,700
drivers on cell phones kill thousands of people. Yeah, this is what I've been trying to point

952
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:24,640
out to people forever. And when I found this article, I was like, finally statistics. Basically,

953
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,600
If you are a 20-year-old driver behind the wheel of a cell phone, your reaction time

954
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,240
is the same as a 70-year-old driver who is not using a cell phone.

955
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,720
Basically, you drive like an old man if you're on your cell phone.

956
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,240
All the more reason to take old people off the road.

957
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,880
Cell phone distractions cause 2,600 deaths and 330,000 injuries in the United States

958
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,800
every year, according to the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

959
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,320
Drivers talking on cell phones are 18% slower to react to brake lights, and they're also

960
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:57,080
12% greater following distance, at least that's one thing good, but they also took 17% longer

961
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,520
to regain speed once they had braked.

962
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,000
Basically it slows down your reaction time, it makes you a danger to yourself and everybody

963
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
else on the road.

964
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,040
So I suggest that everybody read this article and hang up your god damn phone, so everyone

965
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,920
should read this, this is my side of the week.

966
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,080
Alright, and if you want to call me to talk about this, I'll be driving to the bay tonight,

967
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,440
so I'll have plenty of time to talk.

968
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,040
kidding I'm too serious about it I think it's it's actually having known someone

969
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,440
who lost her child because the other driver was talking on her cell phone

970
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,640
once you ran him over then yeah I definitely am very much against it all

971
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:41,320
right going back to games now Loki and can the continuing saga of the Wii

972
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,920
release date you know what I think is interesting if you check dig calm out

973
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,360
this week some story that was speculating like a November 11th launch

974
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:54,160
or something got like a thousand digs or something, and it kind of struck me as amazing, not to

975
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:01,160
knock the story, but their source was kind of like some guy anonymously told us.

976
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,680
I realize that our source to some people doesn't seem much better and that's fine, but I was

977
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:12,280
just kind of surprised that everybody seemed to be jumping at that date based off of shaky

978
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,280
evidence.

979
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,440
Well, Loki has further evidence that seems to point towards October, take it with a grain

980
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,720
assault if you want, but here it is.

981
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,200
And I'd like to preface something real quick.

982
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,440
I saw there was a little story on GameSpot this week talking about Activision's upcoming

983
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,240
titles for the fourth quarter, including some titles like Pimp My Ride the Game, and some

984
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:38,400
Cavalla's Alaskan Hunt game or something like that, and other stuff.

985
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,440
You do remember way back when I talked about this months ago.

986
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,440
I do.

987
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,680
When was that one event?

988
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,880
It was during Destination PlayStation in Florida. They announced all this stuff.

989
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,360
Did anyone pay attention to that? No. When they showed the week of Destination PlayStation,

990
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,200
we did. You'll hear a local saying this.

991
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,080
And seriously, I get this information, you know, and nobody pays attention to it

992
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,660
until like a big site comes and repeats the same thing and then everyone's like,

993
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,980
oh, okay. So anyways, more we dates, of course,

994
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,740
and guess what? They're all around the same time again. And this time we've got Activision

995
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,420
and Ubisoft, and a little bit bigger companies out there should know when the Wii's coming

996
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:25,060
out. Granted some of their games though, like for example, Call of Duty 3, that is on the

997
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:30,500
launch date, which is great. I didn't even know Call of Duty was coming to the Wii. Oh,

998
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:35,220
I mentioned that also on that same podcast about Destination PlayStation. Why didn't

999
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:40,540
they show that at E3? They did. Sort of, in movie form. It was like, it was a pre-rendered

1000
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:46,080
movie it was like eh, but okay, not on the Wii, but they were showing it on other consoles.

1001
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,420
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, that one is coming out the week after launch on October 26th,

1002
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,980
of course, you know, not everything coming out on the launch date.

1003
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:01,940
And then Rayman 4 is coming out day and date with all the systems on the, what was it,

1004
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,740
November 1st.

1005
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:08,900
And then Marvel Ultimate Alliance also coming out actually to coincide with the Playstation

1006
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:15,700
free launch because that's being launched on every single system that day on November

1007
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:22,700
16th. So there's some more games for you. Granted not all of them are on October 18th

1008
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,000
but I think we still haven't gotten a lot of the company's stuff yet and obviously

1009
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,320
you know you're not going to be just announcing stuff for launch. You're going to be launching

1010
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,960
with more titles. It's still within the launch window and it's about a week away

1011
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:41,960
from the thing. I'm still sticking with October 18th and I will be laughing my ass off when

1012
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,700
this does come out on October 18th or when they come out with the news that we're launching

1013
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,980
on the anniversary of the original Nintendo. Okay, what if it doesn't turn out that way

1014
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,900
though? What if they do come out and say it's November 11th? What are you going to do? Well

1015
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,740
then good, it's coming out November 11th. But you know what? I think it's coming out

1016
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:02,740
this date and granted there's powers that may not be able to make it at this launch

1017
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,020
at this launch date you know things can delay stuff but

1018
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,380
it's too convenient

1019
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,580
not to happen i mean

1020
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,300
there's too many coincidences seriously and

1021
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:19,340
with you know more and more publishers every day every week you know agreeing

1022
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,540
that this is the time frame notice all these dates aren't all in november

1023
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,220
they're not all hovering around in november

1024
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,300
like it would be coming out in november so it's definitely okay

1025
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,460
definitely in october

1026
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,900
and most likely on the 18th

1027
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,140
alright

1028
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,300
we'll see

1029
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,580
uh... dark soccer now you have some definite for sure release dates to share

1030
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,940
with us correct? I sure do! But now this isn't for the U.S., these are for the U.K.

1031
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,920
Cause screw the U- I mean

1032
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,260
you do live here. I know, dammit. Alright, okay

1033
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,100
uh...

1034
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,220
this is uh... the release dates for our U.K. listeners um... coming up on the

1035
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,220
ninth of the following games

1036
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,900
we have Zoo Tycoon 2, oh sorry, that was the second

1037
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,660
F11-7A Stealth Fighter on PC is coming out

1038
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,900
Namco Museum 50th Anniversary on GameCube

1039
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,940
Sensible Soccer 2006 on PC, Xbox, PlayStation 2

1040
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,500
and Talkman on PSP

1041
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:21,000
also on the 13th we have Kolpa Inata on PC

1042
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,980
that's going to be the following Monday

1043
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,020
Alright, Loki, do you have anything in the US?

1044
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:30,900
Yeah, there's lots of fun stuff coming out this coming week here.

1045
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,900
Of course, actually, you know, it's kind of getting to a dead part of the month, Urban

1046
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:41,540
Chaos Riot Response is supposed to be coming out, actually that will be the following week.

1047
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,780
This week, though, we have Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories on PlayStation 2, and

1048
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,940
that should be good, unfortunately there isn't multiplayer on it, so that kind of sucks.

1049
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:56,780
But also we've got Ant-One Street Ball coming out on Playstation 2 and Xbox, I believe I

1050
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:02,460
talked about this last week, Gradius Collection is going to be coming out on the PSP, which

1051
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,460
is pretty awesome.

1052
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,220
And then of course like I said the following week, Urban Chaos Right Response on Playstation

1053
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:15,740
2 and Xbox, and the Streetfire Alpha Anthology on the Playstation 2 as well.

1054
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:19,780
And unfortunately if you're waiting for 360 games, there's only going to be one this month

1055
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,140
and that would be MotoGP 2006.

1056
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:28,580
Hopefully there'll be some more Xbox Live games, arcade games to go with that.

1057
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,980
Hopefully Luminous, I'm hoping.

1058
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,980
Hopefully anything.

1059
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,460
Live's been kind of dead since E3 with UNO.

1060
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,700
All you need is UNO.

1061
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:40,660
Well, UNO's really the only game that's really come out in quite a while, and I realize UNO

1062
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:44,900
is a pretty good release, but after hearing some of the stuff they teased at E3, I'm like,

1063
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,220
come on, bring on the Contra, bring on the Luminous.

1064
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:51,100
Well I've got a few more things real quick because there's been some shuffling going

1065
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,100
around obviously.

1066
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,100
DDR has been moving.

1067
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,100
Oh really?

1068
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,100
DDR moved.

1069
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,100
What happened?

1070
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:04,100
Well the updates changed so let's get caught up here with what's been going on.

1071
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:12,960
DDR Supernova not coming out on the 13th but coming out on the 2nd now of September so

1072
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,960
that's pretty good.

1073
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,960
Alright.

1074
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:24,160
up a bit, and of course Supernova, also I believe moved up, and it's now coming out,

1075
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:32,920
let's see here, it was in October, actually also one game that did get delayed, Final

1076
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,800
Fantasy XII, coming out on October 11th now, so that kind of sucks.

1077
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:46,400
Wait a minute, wait a minute, could that be something else to show that there's competition

1078
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,760
with the Wii there?

1079
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,440
Because didn't Dragon Quest VIII get shuffled to come out right on the same day as the Xbox

1080
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,440
360?

1081
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,440
Maybe?

1082
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,440
I don't know.

1083
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,440
Interesting.

1084
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,400
It wasn't a very good, yeah, it wasn't very good to...

1085
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,720
But Final Fantasy XII is a great counter title.

1086
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,720
That's okay.

1087
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,720
Interesting.

1088
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
I'm sorry.

1089
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,720
Not Super...

1090
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:13,020
Ultimax 4, October 2nd now, so that got pushed up a little bit, same day as Elibits, so that's

1091
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,480
kind of cool.

1092
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:29,240
And then of course we have for the 360 universe, which is now November 2nd, and so yeah, they're

1093
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:33,560
really aiming on the 2nd for a lot of these, but lots of good games coming out though in

1094
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,400
the fall that's for sure.

1095
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,480
kind of weird. Why would they all get shifted to the second? Are those all even Tuesdays?

1096
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,760
Why would they do that? They don't come out on Tuesdays. It's usually

1097
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,800
Wednesdays and stuff. Are you sure it's not going to change again

1098
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,160
next week? I'm never certain about dates until it actually

1099
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:58,000
gets to the week of and even then I'm not certain sometimes.

1100
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,720
When it comes down to Konami, they tend to really keep about the same dates for stuff.

1101
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,680
if they announce a game that's coming out in September on a certain week, it usually

1102
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,480
won't shift around too much. So I'm pretty confident those are going to be the dates.

1103
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:16,240
Alright, well we'll see. DarkSakura, going back to the UK for a little bit, do you have

1104
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,160
some information about what's selling over there?

1105
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,640
I've got the chart information. Apparently right up at the top of the list is Hitman

1106
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:32,600

1115
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:21,300
though all over the place um they're speculating that uh the new super mario brothers is gonna

1116
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:29,100
really show up high as well as uh brain training so that's how it's looking right now apparently

they love hitman all right oh it is new they mentioned in chat that september 2nd is saturday

1118
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:39,160
i i i don't know about that loki i think some somebody made a booboo yeah maybe over there

1119
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,780
so i take that with a huge grain of salt i think it's gonna go back to the way it was

1120
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:46,660
next week. So just goes to show your database is not always foolproof.

1121
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:52,460
It's not, but they're pretty close. Top Xbox 360 and Xbox Live

1122
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,420
games are out thanks to Major Nelson. You want to know what folks are playing on the 360?

1123
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,100
The number one game, Call of Duty 2. Number two, Ghost Recon 3. Number three,

1124
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,260
Oblivion.

1125
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,580
All the way on down to number ten, Hitman Blood Money demo, making a new entry

1126
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,700
there on the chart. Rockstar Table Tennis coming in at number seven.

1127
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,900
uh... the top games on the original xbox number one halo 2 of course

1128
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,860
number two battlefield 2 and number three counter strike

1129
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:21,600
all the way on down to uh... ghost recon 2 at number 10

1130
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,540
the rest the titles not a lot of new stuff there on the original xbox

1131
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:30,380
alright uh... i want to share with you guys a story coming in from japan we're

1132
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,280
talking about the ESRB earlier

1133
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,920
well the CERO is japan's equivalent

1134
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,420
and they have a new rating system that they're gonna use.

1135
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,560
They have two separate ratings for M-type games, okay?

1136
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,520
A title gets what's called a D,

1137
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,440
basically there's letters, A, B, C, D, and Z.

1138
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,240
A title gets a D rating if it's 17 years and older,

1139
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,400
and the Z rating is for adults 18 and up,

1140
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,500
so that's kind of interesting.

1141
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,800
If you wanna know the type of games

1142
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,280
that are getting a Z rating right now,

1143
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:10,920
You have Killer7, Max Payne, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, The Getaway, Berserk, D-rated games,

1144
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,280
as in the 17 and older, you have things like Fable, Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive 4, God

1145
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,120
of War, Rumble Roses, kind of interesting this system they have there.

1146
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,120
I like that.

1147
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:28,280
It's A, B, C, D, and Z, where I guess C is 15 and up and B is 12 and up and A is everybody.

1148
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:36,480
It's like the movie rating system because 15 is basically their equivalent of the PG-13.

1149
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:42,040
Like Battle Royale, for example, was a 15 and up movie.

1150
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,040
I always said for a long time we should just mirror the movie system here.

1151
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:49,480
I'm surprised that Berserk was mentioned being that that's an old Dreamcast title.

1152
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:54,200
And then again, though, it was a pretty violent anime and manga.

1153
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,600
Loki!

1154
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,320
Are we going to be seeing gaming at the Olympics soon?

1155
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,320
I hope not.

1156
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,700
But then again, I've seen weird stuff come to the Olympics, so who knows.

1157
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:09,000
But according to GameSpot actually, the founder of the Global Gaming League is trying to get

1158
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,640
gaming as a demo sport in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

1159
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:21,520
And basically has been discussing this with the Chinese government and the possibility

1160
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,800
of having a gaming show at the Olympics.

1161
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:30,440
And if this happens, I guess, I don't know, they're trying to make gaming more viable.

1162
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,520
To be honest, I think they have a better chance of getting masturbation in the Olympics as

1163
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,720
an event over gaming.

1164
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,680
Gaming is so sedentary, it's not even actually a sport.

1165
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,920
No.

1166
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,080
I don't want to see gaming as an Olympic event at all.

1167
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080
Really?

1168
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,320
You don't think it would legitimize gaming or anything?

1169
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,560
No, it's not a sport.

1170
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,360
Gaming doesn't need to be legitimized.

1171
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,080
okay it's not sport they don't have fucking poker

1172
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,560
as an Olympic event okay can't play chess at the Olympics

1173
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,600
okay so no

1174
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,440
it's not event not at all unless they come out with a game

1175
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,840
running your arm I'm track that is not

1176
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:17,080
even close to being a sport okay if it was someone's athletic ability you've

1177
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:17,480
got

1178
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:23,040
the floor exercises for gymnastics DDR is nothing compared to that

1179
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,040
Breakdancing would be a better sport than gaming.

1180
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:33,040
And of course we have the classic witty retort from the chatroom that DDR is a sport in the Netherlands, Norway.

1181
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,040
Good for them.

1182
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,040
Does that count?

1183
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,040
Norway doesn't count.

1184
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,040
Moving on.

1185
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,040
DarkSakura, you have some news on Half-Life.

1186
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,040
Do I? Well, you know what Half-Life is.

1187
01:09:49,040 --> 01:10:01,160
that's what the notes say I know I know I Dark Sakura needs food badly don't

1188
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:10,040
shoot food no um seriously half-life 2 episode 1 is out released in at 6 p.m.

1189
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:19,880
in the UK on a January sorry on a June 6th after June 1st sorry I'm all

1190
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:28,840
backwards today basically it's uh it's out about people can play it and you

1191
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:36,040
actually can they actually had it available for a pre-purchase as well too

1192
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,560
but now you can pre-load it

1193
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,760
for $19.95 or you can buy it

1194
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,320
from scratch and download it. But right now though they're saying the servers

1195
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,400
are pretty loaded on it.

1196
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:54,120
Okay. And for the record in the UK

1197
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,920
EA is distributing the game for Â£15.

1198
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,200
Alrighty. Well if you don't want to have to pay anything

1199
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,960
for your gaming fun. There's a simulation out that might be for you. It's called

1200
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,600
Free Tar Hero. It's basically

1201
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,120
to Guitar Hero what StepMania was to DDR.

1202
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,600
Free Tar Hero is released. It's available at a site.

1203
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,720
It's called, I'm going to have to spell this for you guys,

1204
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,360
A-N-T-O-N-S-T-R-U-Y-K dot com

1205
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,920
slash Free Tar, F-R-E-E-T-A-R.

1206
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,560
and basically what it is is a rhythm game of course based on Guitar Hero

1207
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,360
and you can with according to the website create

1208
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,960
edit and playback button timings for any song on your computer with any gamepad

1209
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,900
like device

1210
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,600
so essentially you can you know have a take an mp3

1211
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,120
make your button pattern to it and you can play Guitar Hero to it and they

1212
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:53,160
even posted some screenshots here on the site

1213
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,560
however all you can really do right now is that

1214
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,920
You can download, I think, the button editor, and then the game itself, I suppose, is going

1215
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,240
to come out later.

1216
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,240
So we'll see.

1217
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,100
But it's in the works.

1218
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,080
So if you've ever wanted to make your own Guitar Hero stuff, well, there's free

1219
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,960
Guitar Hero.

1220
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,080
Loki, some things are being developed for an old platform.

1221
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,140
Yes, the Dreamcast, which is ironic because actually iGen's been doing this thing now

1222
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:24,100
where they're re-revealing every single Dreamcast game that's ever been made and starting

1223
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:31,100
off, you know, with a lot of games. But, according to Dreamcast Scene actually, Goat Store publishing

1224
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:37,540
firm has announced that they have plans to release 10 more games for the Dreamcast over

1225
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:43,280
the next year and a half. And that's great if, I mean, if you have a Dreamcast still.

1226
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,400
And there's actually, you know, a lot of stuff out there that you can download and burn that

1227
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:54,400
that are homebrew, so definitely check it out, I mean, especially if you have a Dreamcast.

1228
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,400
You can get ROMs and all sorts of stuff. I think even when we talked about it a little

1229
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:06,400
while back, they had, what was it, a marathon on the Dreamcast, which is pretty interesting.

1230
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,400
There's still a lot of love for the Dreamcast out there, so the fact that there's folks

1231
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,400
out there, I mean, heck, if they could put out that game on the Genesis that Baker Prince

1232
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,000
came out not that long ago. I'm sure the Dreamcast still has a lot of love for it too, so there's

1233
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,960
always something going to be cooking for that system. Especially because it's so easy to

1234
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,200
burn your own stuff and put it on there. I mean, Genesis takes a lot more work. That

1235
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,440
Baker Prince probably had a lot of work that went into it, but Dreamcast is, you know,

1236
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:35,200
it's kind of easy to bring on CD in comparison. In case you're wondering what games they will

1237
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:42,200
be bringing, well here's some of the games right now and I don't know if these are going

1238
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:49,160
to be too exciting, but Feet of Fury 2, remember that DDR clone that they had for the Dreamcast,

1239
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:58,880
Donk, a Cryptic Illusions remake of the CDI game, Decastle, Age of the Beast Special Edition,

1240
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:05,880
which is basically a clone of Altered, not Altered Beast, I can't remember, it's very

1241
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,720
similar to that Beats of Rage that came out a while back, which is the Streets of Rage

1242
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:20,020
An Amnesia adventure game, a new graphic adventure, a new adventure game from SF Software, a remake

1243
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:28,040
of a Cancel Links game inspired by Tempest 2000, a new 3D fighter using the Quake engine,

1244
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:37,920
Samurai Warrior using the enhanced Pizza Rage engine, and Project Firestorm Shmup, whatever

1245
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,920
the hell that's supposed to mean.

1246
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,380
best of luck to them

1247
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,620
that's a pretty ambitious undertaking

1248
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,620
alright we'll see how they turn out

1249
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,900
uh... hopefully it won't get the cold reception that this is getting there was

1250
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,180
a rom hack

1251
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,980
i think that's what it is a rom hack i don't see what else this could be it's

1252
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:56,180
super mario brothers 2.5D

1253
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:59,400
and what they mean by that is that well it's not 3D but they kind of change the

1254
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,800
graphics to give it a

1255
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,720
kind of an ISO view a little bit like imagine you could turn the camera in the

1256
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,040
original Super Mario Brothers

1257
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,920
And they turned it to the side a little bit, giving everything a little bit of depth.

1258
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,240
Well that's what this whole release is all about.

1259
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,300
I didn't really have time to play it, so I checked out Kotaku's review, they have a review

1260
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:20,480
on it there, one of their staffs reviewed it and said that they played it for about

1261
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,480
30 seconds.

1262
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:26,080
Aside from being hideously ugly, the game is sort of floaty feeling, none of the snappiness

1263
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,480
of the original, and the levels are not identical either, it's a cute idea but needs some serious

1264
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,480
work.

1265
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,480
And so in case you're wondering where you...

1266
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,480
That's according to Kotaku.

1267
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:41,840
want to know where you can download this, right? www.plunder.com slash super dash mario

1268
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:52,360
dash b r o s dash 2 dash 5 d dash d l 3 3 9 0 dot h t m. This doesn't sound like something

1269
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,520
I'm exactly going to be running out and checking out. Yeah, so sorry to say, I'll have to try

1270
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:02,520
Alright, and I'll make a link in the chatroom, of course.

1271
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:08,080
Alrighty, let's go on now to, oh, I saved the best for the last for this break.

1272
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,520
Loki, you have a story about Mac fans.

1273
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,680
Yes, I do.

1274
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,680
I love this.

1275
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:24,080
No, but anyways, according to Business Week, don't hate me, but anyways, according to a

1276
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:31,360
Business Week article, they say that there is a lack of games available for the Mac and

1277
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:39,320
asked, why doesn't Apple try its hand at building good games for the Mac on its own? And well,

1278
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:50,320
their answer, Mac users aren't really into games. And so, yeah, we're not quite sure,

1279
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:55,320
I don't know if they entirely addresses the state of Mac gaming, but

1280
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,820
Yeah, that's why Mac users don't really like games

1281
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,160
And that's according to who again it's according to business week

1282
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:08,680
I'm just making sure you get your source out there when all the hate mail starts coming in for business week says you don't like

1283
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,680
games

1284
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,800
All right, not surprising

1285
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,600
Rini in our chat room who I know is a Mac fan says, whoever wrote that isn't trying.

1286
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,160
They're not trying.

1287
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,160
Fuck you, Businessweek.

1288
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:28,400
All right, we're going to go to a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
