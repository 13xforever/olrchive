00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:20,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, June 4th, 2006, DS Lights hit the street a bit early, could gaming be shown at the next Olympics?

2
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:25,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And more add-ons are announced for RPGs like Final Fantasy XI and Oblivion.

3
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,061
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode number 185 for this June the 4th of 2006.

5
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:48,763
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to talk about video games and gaming and the gaming culture and all the gaming news you guys really want to know about.

6
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:50,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm here to help you do that.

7
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,244
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:53,524
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky and she's here to help you too.

9
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:56,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name is DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:58,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I help those who help themselves.

11
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:24,209
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, through emails and stuff, you've kind of been getting a lot of sickness in the past six months on the show.

12
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:34,375
[SPEAKER_01]: To not go into it in too much detail, all of the random illnesses that I've had have all stemmed from one thing, which is chronic fatigue syndrome.

13
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:40,098
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who think that taking an app will help you get over it, screw you, because it doesn't.

14
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cumulative issue.

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that just takes nutrition, time.

16
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:49,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually it goes away.

17
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:50,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have it their whole lives.

18
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are bedridden for years with it.

19
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just really tired.

20
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:58,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually reading in Wikipedia about this because you were talking to me about this on AOL.

21
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually linked me to something in Wikipedia on it and it turns out you have something in common with Cher.

22
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:04,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, joy.

23
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:04,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

24
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:08,688
[SPEAKER_01]: if I could turn back time.

25
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,451
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have an affinity towards hay or anything like that.

26
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:16,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that must be the one and only Loki because here come the jokes from Techmaster Loki.

27
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:18,757
[SPEAKER_02]: God, Cher is like...

28
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

29
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wondered what happened to Mr. Ed.

30
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:23,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Cher is what happened to Mr. Ed.

31
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:25,760
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the same person!

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Same person!

33
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,382
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother loves Cher.

34
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:30,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went to a Cher concert.

35
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:33,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you want to make all those jokes about, you know, because I'm gay I must love Cher.

36
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:36,829
[SPEAKER_02]: She's okay, but my mom loves her.

37
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:37,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

38
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Loves her.

39
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:42,074
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's made out of porcelain and ceramic and acrylic.

40
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:42,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

41
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Now wait, we're not share talk, so back to games for a minute.

42
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,011
[SPEAKER_02]: In FanimeCon last week, somebody actually brought you chocolate, right?

43
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:53,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, one of our listeners brought me chocolate and I'm very, very, very grateful.

44
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got all over the bottom of my purse, so I had to wash my purse.

45
00:02:58,617 --> 00:03:01,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a couple pieces got out, all the rest of it were in my tummy.

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I did share a couple pieces because I'm nice.

47
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:06,462
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way I could eat all that chocolate.

48
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:07,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't share it with me.

49
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have if you'd hung around.

50
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:57,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I went nuts in the dealer's room Sunday I bought Dan a Famicom controller looking pencil box And I bought him an Ice Climbers cell phone strap It's all digitized I bought myself a slime plushie A lot of Kingdom Hearts, a lot of Final Fantasy, a lot of Squeenix love

51
00:03:58,095 --> 00:03:59,316
[SPEAKER_01]: and I bought a doll.

52
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:02,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Octane had a booth that's about the size of this desk.

53
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:03,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Of a computer desk.

54
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:04,699
[SPEAKER_02]: A normal computer desk.

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Red Octane wasn't really showing much, were they?

56
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,605
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Guitar Hero and they were selling controllers and that's it.

57
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the groove, absent.

58
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:14,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of weird.

59
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:22,431
[SPEAKER_03]: They were selling the DDR pads but that's about it.

60
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:23,652
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just selling stuff.

61
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:24,292
[SPEAKER_03]: They were a vendor.

62
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:26,574
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't trying to show off new games or anything.

63
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:26,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just

64
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:29,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Our Crap By It, you know, that type of thing.

65
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:43,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you who was impressive, though, was Yes Japan, that's doing, they have, like, Japanese lessons, but they also are a label that are bringing out a lot of Japanese artists in the United States, and one of them is Guitar Vader, who did a lot of music in Jet Set Radio.

66
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:44,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

67
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:55,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Vader wasn't there this year, although their guitarist made it out, or one of their people made it out and was doing some stuff with a couple of the other bands there, but I didn't get to see it.

68
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:56,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I was...

69
00:04:57,305 --> 00:05:14,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was near our panel or something around our panel, so I didn't actually get to see this, but I did get to talk with them, and who knows, you guys might hear something, some Guitar Vader on our station soon.

70
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, very cool.

71
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:26,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say real quick, as far as live appearances go, we are confirmed for Fonamay 2007, and next year maybe we're looking to broadcast from the center stage, which should be pretty awesome.

72
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:31,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend there is working on getting us broadcasting ability.

73
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:31,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

74
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:34,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And just other live appearances coming up.

75
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:39,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in July, and not even these guys know about this yet, but there's the Sacramento thing is confirmed for July.

76
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:41,106
[SPEAKER_01]: How I knew about that.

77
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:44,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered a doll.

78
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:49,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting into the 60 centimeter Volks of Bitsu dolls.

79
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered from Junkie Spot and he called me today to make sure that my address was right.

80
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And just gave me all kinds of pointers and tips and said, and we're going to be at this convention.

81
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:58,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, I might be there.

82
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,092
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

83
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find that ironic.

84
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,194
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're going to do that in Sacramento in July.

85
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:07,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're trying to get us to Seattle tomorrow.

86
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:14,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year, if we can afford it, I know at least I'll go, and I think Jamie was talking about going, so maybe if we can get Loki, we'll all go to the SakuraCon next year.

87
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:15,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meCon.

88
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping to do one East CoastCon next year.

89
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:20,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what or when yet.

90
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:23,366
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll really be up to Ranma, who's my East Coast buddy.

91
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

92
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:50,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Foname07 on the Foname boards

93
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Ragnarok and I made Assassin finally.

94
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:14,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit job level 50.

95
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:43,393
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I'm like assassin job level 24 and that happened in like a day and that's basically been it.

96
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:51,118
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been UNO going on in my house and we were going to buy a Whirlwind pinball machine but that fell through.

97
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,184
[SPEAKER_01]: We got back our Judge Dredd machine and as it's working out we've got a line in on a jackpot.

98
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:12,813
[SPEAKER_01]: A pin bot right now, but Dan's wanting to find a jack bot, which has the same play field as pin bot and has the same music as pin bot and the special music.

99
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:19,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a combination of pin bot and bride of pin bot with a souped up display and board and everything.

100
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:22,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if you get that, I'm going to be at your house every day.

101
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:28,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I told Dan that, and he was like, well, half the reason we get the pins is for friends to play.

102
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:30,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's come over and play our other pins, too.

103
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:34,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, what is with the sudden interest in pinball games?

104
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:34,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Sudden?

105
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:35,308
[SPEAKER_01]: My butt.

106
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:35,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's been.

107
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:39,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you guys haven't really bought machines before.

108
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we had an apartment before.

109
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:42,435
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right.

110
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,459
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a garage now, which we intend on filling with machines.

111
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,985
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dan's been downloading the pinball emulators, like PinMame and some of those.

112
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:59,475
[SPEAKER_01]: for like ages and one of the machines that we're really really looking for although it's really expensive we want to get a good deal on one is a Black Knight 2000

113
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:03,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've asked this on a previous show like a long time ago.

114
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:03,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Theater of Magic.

115
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:04,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we were podcasting.

116
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Pin Mame based out of Sacramento?

117
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,493
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who do that?

118
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:08,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Nearby.

119
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've seen a car around town that has like a Pin Mame license plate.

120
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, is that the guy?

121
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,699
[SPEAKER_01]: No, dude, it's Carmichael.

122
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

123
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's out of Carmichael because Dan's been by there.

124
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get that guy on the show.

125
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:20,445
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a stone's throw away.

126
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:21,646
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to get a hold of him.

127
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki practically... No, you're in Orangevale, not Carmichael.

128
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:25,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldfish

129
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:33,566
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet!

130
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:34,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I no longer like you.

131
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,927
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually Pretzel Goldfish.

132
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:36,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, your games.

133
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:38,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Games, oh yeah.

134
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Goldfish the game.

135
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,630
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

136
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have been doing not a whole much of gaming.

137
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:48,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been intending on sitting down with Kingdom Hearts, but I've been like, meh.

138
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:49,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Meh.

139
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:54,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just been pinball, pinball, pinball, pinball.

140
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:56,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And I play Dig Dug.

141
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,539
[SPEAKER_01]: On one of those little joystick-looking video game machines.

142
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Machine and a Joystick.

143
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:03,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Machine and a Joystick thing.

144
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:07,816
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a Pac-Man score tournament, and then I was like, screw y'all, I'm playing Dig Dug.

145
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got further in Dig Dug than anybody in the house could.

146
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:11,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

147
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:12,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

148
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:14,073
[SPEAKER_02]: DigDugMan

149
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:36,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't like the kid size one, but they had an adult size one too that was awesome.

150
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,825
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the kid one at Stockton Golf Land.

151
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:51,489
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lord of the Rings pinball is the win, but it was... The Lord of the Rings pinball and Star Wars pinball were the pinball... I think it was called Pinball 2000 series, which actually did not appeal to a lot of pinball players because it was more of an old school pinball thing.

152
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:55,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think those are the only two Pinball 2000 machines there are and we're not seeing any more.

153
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:57,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Williams stopped making pinball machines.

154
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:01,133
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the last pinball machines that I would love to play is...

155
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:03,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Bang Bar

156
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:26,256
[SPEAKER_01]: We need, yeah, we do need Orange Lounge Pinball.

157
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:29,076
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Poo Eater says, OLR Pinball would be fun.

158
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:30,457
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to bang around Loki's balls.

159
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how Loki would feel about that.

160
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:37,299
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do like DJ Poo Eater's other comment about, I like the Elvira Pinball, because Elvira's the shit.

161
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, you know, actually one of the old school ones that they had there that they were repairing was an Electra Pinball.

162
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,101
[SPEAKER_01]: That one that had the three levels, the inside level, the medium, and the outside level.

163
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:50,362
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty, from what I understand, pretty hard to get one of those.

164
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,583
[SPEAKER_01]: But we actually traded them our Fathom Pinball for Johnny Mnemonic.

165
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:56,623
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN has a great idea, Snakes on a Plane Pinball.

166
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:57,543
[SPEAKER_02]: As if.

167
00:11:57,563 --> 00:12:02,624
[SPEAKER_01]: What's sad though is that I think that pinballs are like a dying breed.

168
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:07,805
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about pinball games on a video?

169
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:15,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've actually, this is a good thing, the people who do Ultracade are doing Ultra Pin.

170
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:16,292
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

171
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really a replacement for an actual table, though?

172
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:33,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

173
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:45,264
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing about this is that it's actually going to emulate something like 30 to 60, I think, something classic tables, including Black Knight, Pinbot, Bride of Pinbot.

174
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to find some more information on it, but they've actually, I think, they're supposed to have some in test locations.

175
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:57,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's cool, but I just don't like that idea as much as actually watching the metal ball go up the ramp and around.

176
00:12:57,812 --> 00:12:58,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to see it.

177
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:06,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd say, though, that for the sake of, you know, since these tables are getting harder and harder to find, I think that it's a good idea.

178
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,104
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good idea to bring it out there for people who

179
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,326
[SPEAKER_01]: who missed the old school pinball action.

180
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:11,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

181
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:15,587
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, before we turn into the pinball show, we better get back on some video games.

182
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, pinball's a video game.

183
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:17,648
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with pinball.

184
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,449
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video screen in the background with the dot matrix, but hey.

185
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:22,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

186
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

187
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:31,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to play more games, but unfortunately the wife has been hogging the 360 to play Bejeweled.

188
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:34,374
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so weird to hear because the wife hates video games.

189
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

190
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:37,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so what did I do yesterday?

191
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:38,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was playing...

192
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:41,206
[SPEAKER_03]: more new Super Mario Bros.

193
00:13:41,286 --> 00:14:08,131
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm already getting tired of the game I'm already on level 4 I've actually completely finished 1 through 3 gotten all the secret stuff and all that but I'm just kind of getting bored with it already and I don't know it's just not as good as some of the other games I guess um then I've been playing trying to get through Ghost Recon I'm almost done with that finally and then um

194
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I've been trying a few other games.

195
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:15,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried that, uh... What was it?

196
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:16,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Jewel Quest.

197
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:17,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That was okay.

198
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:18,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

199
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already bought, like, almost every single live game or arcade game on there.

200
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:26,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for, like, the crappy card games, because who wants crappy card games?

201
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:26,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

202
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:29,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you had, like, Uno.

203
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno's fun!

204
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:33,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Uno.

205
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:37,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Uno's fun, but, like, you know, Hard With Hearts, Hard With Backgammon, I mean, no.

206
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,030
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

207
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame.

208
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

209
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:45,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really gotten anything new.

210
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: No new games coming out that I really want.

211
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:49,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitman maybe.

212
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:51,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know though.

213
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:56,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking just waiting until July, August when some better games come out.

214
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:07,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been to get Jaws on my PlayStation 2 hard drive so I can bust that game out because

215
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard the game is so damn glitchy and stuff, but it's worth trying because you can play it as a shark.

216
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:17,417
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what though, with a concept like that, it might be cool to have a game as glitchy as Driver 3.

217
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:18,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

218
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:22,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It is as glitchy as Driver 3, so that's kind of cool.

219
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Driver 3, that was what made it fun, is the fact that it was so crappy.

220
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:34,465
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the perfect balance of really shitty AI and gameplay elements,

221
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:38,386
[SPEAKER_03]: with, you know, just, you know, an okay game.

222
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:46,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it wasn't so bad to where as you don't want to play it, but it wasn't, you know, so good as where as you need to pick it up.

223
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,775
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just equally awful, you know, across all levels.

224
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:55,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that game's really fun, especially if you can get it cheap because it's so glitchy.

225
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:59,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You can literally play it for like an afternoon and just... So, it's like one of those... It's like a B-movie.

226
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:00,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

227
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:01,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a bad B-movie.

228
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:02,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so bad it's good.

229
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:03,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

230
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:03,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jaws 3D.

231
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:11,214
[SPEAKER_03]: and Jaws on the consoles which just came out.

232
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:12,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cheap ass game.

233
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:21,456
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $29.99 but just wait a couple of weeks once people buy it and say hey this game sucks and then they sell it back get those copies for even cheaper.

234
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:22,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what you need to do.

235
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:24,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

236
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:29,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories again.

237
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:30,438
[SPEAKER_02]: The usual.

238
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:33,819
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going back to the team games we've been doing free-for-alls and

239
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still fun because we just find new ways to kill each other.

240
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:42,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a highlight of the day.

241
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

242
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:48,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention in our chat room right now over at OrangeLawnRadio.com, click on chat.

243
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:54,445
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are listening live here on Sunday night on our station, it looks like DMN is in chat right now.

244
00:16:54,485 --> 00:17:00,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, for whatever reason, has an extra Zelda GameCube collector's disc burning a hole in his pocket.

245
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the one that had all like the classic Zelda games on it.

246
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just giving it away to a random chatter right now.

247
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:07,349
[SPEAKER_02]: He's asking trivia questions and making a game out of it.

248
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:07,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know,

249
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,331
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, you guys cool with that?

250
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah.

251
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:14,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I got ripped out of the one that actually had the Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on there as well.

252
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:18,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I only got the one with both of the Nintendo 64 ones.

253
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:19,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have an extra.

254
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You could enter DMN's contest right now.

255
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:22,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

256
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:24,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I never played that one anyway.

257
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:29,459
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get one of those multiplayer Pac-Man games.

258
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,060
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one on the GameCube, remember?

259
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Pac-Man Versus.

260
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:34,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

261
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did play that.

262
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:36,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked fun, though.

263
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:41,139
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I want to go over to my gaming week, because I actually have quite a bit that I was playing this week.

264
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,420
[SPEAKER_02]: In my personal life, I got jury duty this week.

265
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people were telling me that jury duty, you know, bring a book.

266
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:48,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be boring.

267
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:51,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to sit there all day long, and nothing's going to happen.

268
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:55,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took my DS, and yeah, there was a lot of dead time there.

269
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:58,223
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of it didn't go how they said it would.

270
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,243
[SPEAKER_02]: They said I would get dismissed by the end of the day.

271
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:03,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got put on a jury for a trial that's going to last two weeks.

272
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:03,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

273
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:13,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll be playing a lot of DS while I'm at the courthouse because there's a lot of down... I mean, we get like hour and a half lunches and all this crazy stuff, so I have a DS to keep me busy.

274
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:22,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Final Fantasy 1, which I realize is not a DS game, but Extifer keeps forgetting to loan me the new Super Mario Bros.

275
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:23,879
[SPEAKER_02]: cartridge that I keep wanting to play.

276
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only other game I had ready available when I left for the courthouse was Super Princess Peach.

277
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:31,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And that game kind of... I don't know.

278
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:34,723
[SPEAKER_02]: An action game isn't as easy to play...

279
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:35,903
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

280
00:18:54,356 --> 00:19:00,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 1, if you haven't played it before, the one on the Game Boy Advance, they really souped it up from the NES.

281
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:12,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as frustrating because they switched the battle system to more like Final Fantasy 4, where if your whole party attacks one monster and it dies, it doesn't end up being wasted attacks, it will attack a different monster.

282
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:16,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was one really frustrating thing about Final Fantasy 1 on the NES.

283
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:20,530
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know that kinda adds to the strategy element I suppose but that is different.

284
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:39,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I also got a chance to play something new 2DX Red Beatmania 2DX Red or 11 and this is the import game it's not here in America you do have to import it from Japan and of course if you know Beatmania in the US then I'm sure you have heard of the

285
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:46,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese series that spawned it, and now it's up to its 11th home version game, 13th arcade game.

286
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:55,589
[SPEAKER_02]: The things I like about 2DX Red, the interface is great, it's slick, it's got an awesome interface, it's a customizable interface.

287
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:04,797
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things you unlock, you don't really unlock songs in 2DX anymore, you unlock either gallery art or you unlock customization pieces.

288
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:17,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually change the picture that's on the turntable, the bar that is falling down during the parts of the song, what the notes look like when they explode when you hit the buttons, or you can change the whole damn skin around it.

289
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:20,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's only like seven or so preset ones.

290
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:28,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have total freedom, but it's still pretty cool because you can mix and match and kind of make the game your own a little bit.

291
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:33,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was kind of a neat addition and something fun to unlock there.

292
00:20:33,194 --> 00:20:39,556
[SPEAKER_02]: My only real problem with Beatmania 2DX Red is that I'm not a fan of the songs as much as previous styles.

293
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:46,357
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really good songs, but overall I think I prefer 9th, 7th, kind of going back to some of the older styles.

294
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:51,759
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did bring back some good older songs, except V isn't one of them.

295
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:57,305
[SPEAKER_02]: V is the song that has been in like every Beatmania 2DX game in Japan since 5th style, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th.

296
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:58,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not in 11th.

297
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:00,729
[SPEAKER_02]: They finally gave it a rest for a little while.

298
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:08,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, until they come up with the next, you know, was it 2DX 14 or whatever and it's gonna be V2 or something like that or VV or something.

299
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be H, it'll be Handel.

300
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:11,549
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

301
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,291
[SPEAKER_02]: The other part that I love about 2DX Red is rival data.

302
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:24,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Miklatov is the one that brought it to the house here, so I had a chance to play it, and I started playing on my memory card.

303
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:29,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was able to put in his memory card and load his scores onto my card.

304
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:37,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that would do is it would show me, hey, these are the songs you're doing better than Miklatov at, and these are the songs you need to improve on if you want to be better than Miklatov.

305
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:39,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, I think, load up to five people.

306
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:43,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other cool thing is you can do rival data against yourself, essentially.

307
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:58,510
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go into the options and you go all the way down to the bottom and you see this little turntable, you can change it so that if you're playing one player, you know how usually in Beatmania the right side of the screen, if you're playing left or vice versa, if you're a player two side person, the left side is just blank.

308
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing happens there.

309
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:07,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what will happen instead is that that will be replaced by a bar graph that goes up showing you how your combo compares to the last game that you played.

310
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, not your combo, but your Beatmania points.

311
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,964
[SPEAKER_02]: You get plus two for a flashing great, plus one for a great.

312
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:14,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of shows that in bar graph.

313
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar to Keyboard Mania.

314
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,472
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever played Keyboard Mania, it's almost like they stole it from Keyboard Mania.

315
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:19,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So, huh?

316
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:21,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

317
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:22,898
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

318
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:30,907
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah, so rival data is pretty cool and it kind of gives you incentive to keep playing because I have to be better than Miklatov, so that's 2DX Red.

319
00:22:31,427 --> 00:22:35,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely recommend it to music games fans that have a Japanese PlayStation 2.

320
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:48,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you guys that don't have a Japanese PlayStation 2, let's hope that Konami of America releases a Beatmania 2 here in the US and that they'll use this game's interface to model it off of because I think that would happen and that would be pretty sweet.

321
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:51,842
[SPEAKER_02]: R2-Beat Beat Mania

322
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:15,832
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to play R2-B because R2-B is a real creative idea for a music game.

323
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:22,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like it because it gets into the kind of competitive nature a little more, like some of the songs are very competitive.

324
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:30,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to check this out, there's actually one of our listeners has a website that's all about this game.

325
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:37,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have to kind of follow the directions on the forums of this website to be able to play the game because it's all in Japanese.

326
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless you read and understand Japanese fluently,

327
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,740
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ MaxxUS.bamanistyle.com

328
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:28,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes me think of like a Mario Kart rhythm game because in one of the modes you can use items on other players and it's pretty creative some of the items they come up with like one of them will send out this giant King Kong type thing onto the racetrack that'll beat the racetrack so that your screen shakes so it's really hard to see the notes as they're coming down another item will like throw headphones onto your opponent's head that will change the song completely that they're hearing so that the beats won't match up or anything makes it very difficult for a couple measures

329
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:29,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of fun.

330
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:33,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where I get the Mario Kart thing, because the items really add a whole different flair to it.

331
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:37,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pros about this game, it's free.

332
00:24:38,314 --> 00:24:39,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Graphically, it's pretty kick-butt.

333
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:44,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I was given a tip, you can actually use Alt-Enter to play the game in a window if you don't like it taking up your whole screen.

334
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a real kind of clever music game.

335
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,604
[SPEAKER_02]: The only cons that I really saw is that...

336
00:24:50,464 --> 00:24:54,786
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a really steep learning curve because of the fact that the game's not in English.

337
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:59,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to be patient if you want to learn this game.

338
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:04,210
[SPEAKER_02]: You will get frustrated with it very easy if the language barrier is going to be a problem for you.

339
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But I force myself to kind of get through the tutorial and everything.

340
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:08,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not so bad.

341
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:09,452
[SPEAKER_02]: You can figure it out.

342
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:10,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Use common sense.

343
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:11,192
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll figure out how to play the game.

344
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:13,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like it.

345
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys should check it out if you get a chance.

346
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,734
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like music games, because it's free.

347
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:28,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is the type of game I would pay money for, just because it seems like the type of game I'll only play for a little while, even though it does offer some kind of customization, like you can change your hair, change your clothes.

348
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:32,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really see myself playing this the long term, but I don't know.

349
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:35,439
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have the fact that they can expand...

350
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,320
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

351
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:50,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of a network of a bunch of other different kinds of games.

352
00:25:50,387 --> 00:25:53,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in that way, it'll be great.

353
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually part of a network called GameChew.jp.

354
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,271
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their website, GameChew.jp.

355
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:06,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I would really enjoy this game as a part of a selection of games from a website.

356
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:11,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out if you guys want to see a crazy-looking game.

357
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:12,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that...

358
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a buffet of Xbox Live arcade games and some Rockstar table tennis.

359
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,065
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all for me.

360
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:21,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news here on Orange Lounge Radio.

361
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:24,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start off tonight with Loki, I think.

362
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:35,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and basically the story to start things off is about the DS Lite and how some stores just don't get street dates.

363
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:41,191
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the store chains being Target, the other one being Walmart, and basically...

364
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:46,813
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the shipments of these new systems have already come in to pretty much everybody.

365
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:50,234
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I mean, my company that I work at, they actually have them right now.

366
00:26:50,694 --> 00:27:02,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, like most things, you're not supposed to sell until street date, you know, to basically either make it, you know, fair for everybody, you know, so that one person doesn't have it sooner than the other and that type of thing.

367
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,797
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, companies don't realize this or either just ignore it.

368
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, in the case of like certain Targets and Walmarts,

369
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Just went ahead and sold it the day they got them.

370
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:18,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So people have already been picking them up, put them on eBay and whatnot.

371
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:23,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically if you're lucky enough to find one, more power to you.

372
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:27,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is ridiculous since you can just order them online from Japan.

373
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and it doesn't matter anyways.

374
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,599
[SPEAKER_00]: For almost the same price.

375
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're really coming out in about a week.

376
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just wait.

377
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, this is not the first time Target's broken street date.

378
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no.

379
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:36,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised Toys R Us wasn't one of those.

380
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:38,362
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they've done, like, you know, Katamari.

381
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:39,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, We Are Katamari.

382
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:40,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when we called the Target.

383
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:42,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know what?

384
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:45,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And these companies, you know, they think that they're getting away with this shit.

385
00:27:46,704 --> 00:27:47,764
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Nintendo will know.

386
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:50,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just like, you know, Namco.

387
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:53,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Namco is aware of the problem, you know, with We Heart Katamari.

388
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Or not We Heart Katamari.

389
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:56,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, We Heart Katamari.

390
00:27:56,448 --> 00:28:00,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And they basically, you know, those stores will not be getting their product on time.

391
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they'll be getting it the day of or whatever.

392
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,411
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't get it early anymore.

393
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:08,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not a good thing to do, to piss off Nintendo right before the Wii launch.

394
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:12,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, if they don't have it, people are going out of their places, so.

395
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:13,911
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good for them.

396
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:15,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what they did with GameStop and stuff.

397
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:21,095
[SPEAKER_02]: When GameStop didn't have the pre-orders, people went to Best Buy, who didn't do pre-orders, and tried to get it that way.

398
00:28:21,895 --> 00:28:25,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, I mean, if you can find them early, great.

399
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:27,979
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, it's just a redesign of the damn console.

400
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do you really need one right away?

401
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't.

402
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:38,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't think they're any more comfortable to play than the US ones anyway, because of that sharp edge.

403
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:40,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

404
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:47,540
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, do you have any news about the colors of the systems that we're seeing?

405
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, in Europe, they're getting two colors.

406
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:52,446
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting black and white.

407
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty monochrome there.

408
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:58,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's interesting, because we're only getting white.

409
00:28:58,353 --> 00:28:59,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they get black?

410
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:00,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're special.

411
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess getting screwed on the price finally.

412
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Karma pays off for them because they always get screwed on prices.

413
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:10,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Their price actually is going to be out on June 23rd in Europe.

414
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:16,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Their price is £99.99 or €149.99.

415
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:23,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as far as some games that they're getting on June 30th, the new Super Mario Bros.

416
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:23,880
[SPEAKER_01]: will be out.

417
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Brain Training is on June 9th.

418
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:28,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs Dalmatian and Friends is on June 16th.

419
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:30,864
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting a Dalmatian one.

420
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:35,004
[SPEAKER_01]: which is actually, I would be jealous if I even played my Nintendogs anymore.

421
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:36,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

422
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:37,764
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

423
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:43,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, VidPower in our chat room reminds us that there actually is a Frapper map.

424
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:45,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Horizons Radio has a Frapper map, too.

425
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:48,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're on Frapper, F-R-A-P-P-R dot com, look us up.

426
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:51,387
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can also look up DS Lite Availability.

427
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:52,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cram that all together into one word.

428
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:56,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually checking targets to see if any have the DS Lite.

429
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:57,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I already looked in this area and there are none.

430
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want one, but I don't know.

431
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,500
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

432
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

433
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

434
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:08,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on with more news.

435
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:10,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

436
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:17,543
[SPEAKER_03]: In other news, also Nintendo related, we've got information that the Wii is not going to have Dolby Digital out.

437
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,604
[SPEAKER_03]: At least no 5.1 surround sound.

438
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:25,125
[SPEAKER_03]: They will have ProLogic, which is still good, but I mean, I don't know.

439
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you really need it since they're not going to be doing HD anyway, so...

440
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:30,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

441
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, I don't know, I don't have Dolby Digital in my house anyway, so I don't care.

442
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:59,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm sure there's some people that will be kind of, hmm, but... Well, I'm kind of, uh... Well, you have Dolby Digital in my house.

443
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:04,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, literally, I mean, who... Okay, so you have it in your house.

444
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's great.

445
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:10,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, you have a ProLogic setup on yours, so it sounds great.

446
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:11,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it sounds fine.

447
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:13,395
[SPEAKER_01]: My receiver also has ProLogic, so...

448
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:15,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be the end of the world.

449
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:19,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're not supporting HD, true, I should say true HD or whatever anyway.

450
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:24,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as long as the games are fun, I'm not going to worry too much about the sound.

451
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:28,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we already know there's a speaker in the controller, which is kind of, you know, can't really get that, 5.1 or not.

452
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:31,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital 5.1, whatever.

453
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:33,894
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have the speaker in the controller, so...

454
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:35,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

455
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Is PlayStation 3 looking at it?

456
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that another thing they're trying to do?

457
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:56,657
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2 had optical digital audio out, so I wouldn't imagine that PlayStation 3 does as well.

458
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:02,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, that could be on one of those lists of things that they've scrapped for the price point.

459
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:02,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

460
00:32:02,803 --> 00:32:03,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be honest.

461
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:06,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know a lot about audio setups.

462
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:09,728
[SPEAKER_02]: The different types kind of go over my head a little bit, so it's interesting.

463
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:10,429
Hmm.

464
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:13,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's Phil Harrison

465
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:38,619
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way I understand why people say we stole Nintendo's idea, but it's a little stupid if you forgive the remark.

466
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:44,944
[SPEAKER_02]: When we brought the PlayStation to the market in 1994, we introduced real-time 3D graphics for the first time.

467
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:49,608
[SPEAKER_02]: When Nintendo launched its Nintendo 64 in 1996, it also had 3D graphics.

468
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we say Nintendo stole our idea?

469
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously not.

470
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:53,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Fox PC Engine Duo 3D

471
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:11,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

472
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are pretty much full of crap.

473
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm surprised he's not actually researching it.

474
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:16,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two questions.

475
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:19,131
[SPEAKER_02]: First, did Sony steal Nintendo's idea?

476
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:19,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Why or why not?

477
00:33:20,252 --> 00:33:20,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I say no.

478
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:21,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

479
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:28,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they did something to make themselves competitive in that aspect, but I don't think they stole the idea.

480
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:31,053
[SPEAKER_02]: How easy would it have been to just come out with a controller?

481
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:31,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the same thing.

482
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:37,135
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried something a little bit different, and although I'm not the biggest fan of the idea, I wouldn't say they stole it.

483
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they just kind of tried to do something...

484
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:40,255
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Any?

485
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:16,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to talk about who stole what from the Super Nintendo having been out?

486
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:18,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's business.

487
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies steal from each other all the time.

488
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:23,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, remember when Vanilla Coke came out?

489
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:26,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we all loved Vanilla Coke at the time when it first came out.

490
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanilla Pepsi was a better product.

491
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:29,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanilla Pepsi came out like two months later.

492
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:30,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Pepsi a bunch of thieves?

493
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:31,852
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's what they do.

494
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:33,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They always copy each other.

495
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the point of business to find out other businesses' trade secrets and cash in on it.

496
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:39,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you have a thought?

497
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:44,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, so they say, we didn't copy the way it's been in production for two years.

498
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:49,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years ago, there was a game put out on Game Boy Advance called WarioWare Twisted.

499
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,243
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the same kind of technology in there that has, you know, that's in the controller.

500
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck you, Sony, you're still copying somebody.

501
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:01,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whether you want, first off, you got your facts wrong anyway, so it doesn't matter.

502
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:03,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so they copied it.

503
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:05,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, you know, whatever.

504
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:13,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've copied controller designs of the analog sticks and stuff from Nintendo 64, Rumble from Nintendo 64.

505
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:14,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

506
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:21,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Xbox Live, they're going to be copying that for the PlayStation 3 online service or whatever.

507
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:47,982
[SPEAKER_03]: it's what people like and so obviously you have to put it in your console but don't try to pass it off as this is an original idea that you came up with okay basically say yeah our competitions do it we need to do this in order to be competitive that's all you gotta say that is it pretty simple instead of being a jackass going we came up with it first no I don't think so so you know what great if it works for your console awesome

508
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:54,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be stupid, and if they're going to be taking out the Rumble feature for this, I think it's a really bad trade-off.

509
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:55,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

510
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:59,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to go to our chat room with some comments, because they're lit up right now a little bit.

511
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Spiritsnare would like to point out, Pepsi Blue came out, but Coke Blue never did.

512
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:07,585
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because Pepsi Blue was kind of crappy.

513
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,026
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Windex.

514
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:09,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it at all.

515
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like Windex, and it made your poo change colors.

516
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:14,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for sharing.

517
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:15,931
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is there here?

518
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:16,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

519
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,933
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something else I was going to... Oh, here it is.

520
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,614
[SPEAKER_02]: O2G said maybe if they didn't implement it at the last minute.

521
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:27,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think maybe the whole last minute implementation of this is what makes them look like they're thieving here?

522
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:28,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.

523
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:38,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they were saying that, oh yeah, this is something we're thinking about or something like that, that would be a little different, you know, if that was something they were toying around with.

524
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:44,946
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that they brought it in, I mean, so what if they've been working on it for two years, we haven't heard anything about it, we haven't seen, you know,

525
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:46,237
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

526
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Warioware Sony Hate

527
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:26,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

528
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if they put out a good product they'd earn our love.

529
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:54,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Their system right now, they don't have a great lineup of games coming out.

530
00:37:54,895 --> 00:38:03,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, okay, the system may be cool, but it's pumping out the same kind of graphics, same kind of gameplay as you're going to be getting on the Xbox 360, but it's more expensive.

531
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:07,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they think that they need a Blu-ray drive in there because they're really trying to push this whole...

532
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:11,350
[SPEAKER_03]: HD movie format on me.

533
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:18,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to pay the extra $200 for this thing when I've just a few years ago replaced all my VHS with DVDs.

534
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:20,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they want me to do this again?

535
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:20,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

536
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:26,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't own an HD TV that's going to benefit from this, so why should I have to spend the extra $200 for it?

537
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:30,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus they came out a year later, plus they're doing all these unoriginal ideas.

538
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:31,399
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

539
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:36,942
[SPEAKER_03]: If they do come out with some really good games like maybe a new Twisted Metal or something like that, that'd be great, but the whole thing

540
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:45,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony is a great company and all, but even after the PSP came out and the launch games for that, the launch games were pitiful for the PSP.

541
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:47,319
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all just rehashed.

542
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:48,199
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

543
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Twisted Metal head-on?

544
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,340
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Twisted Metal 2 all over again.

545
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous being a glaring exception, though.

546
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but that's a third-party company, though.

547
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:59,682
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a third-party... I mean, that game could have been made on the original PlayStation 2.

548
00:39:00,062 --> 00:39:02,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not something that really needed...

549
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:03,603
[SPEAKER_03]: and the PlayStation Portable.

550
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:30,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me interject here with some comments from chat, although some folks in chat are cheering you on there, BoyWonderZero and HintIrenee.

551
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:34,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale is mentioning, if anyone should sue anyone, it should be Ralph Baer.

552
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:39,455
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the guy who invented the idea for a home video game console and got almost nothing out of it himself.

553
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting thought.

554
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:48,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll phrase a question towards DarkSakura, because I know you have not been a fan of Sony's PlayStation 3 stuff lately.

555
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:50,658
[SPEAKER_02]: What could Sony do...

556
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:55,702
[SPEAKER_02]: to win you over and you would be rah rah rah about this console on launch day.

557
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,325
[SPEAKER_02]: What could they do between now and launch day to win you back?

558
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:00,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have time for me to list it?

559
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:00,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

560
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple if you've got it.

561
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay.

562
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:04,932
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, drop the price.

563
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:08,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Take out all of the unnecessary shit.

564
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Take out the gyroscope.

565
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:10,559
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't fucking need it.

566
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,153
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't need high def that not every system is going to be able to manage.

567
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:18,014
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need two HDMI ports.

568
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:19,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one HDMI port.

569
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:23,857
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, enough to, you know, because how many people are going to hook up two HDMI ports?

570
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:25,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they only have one now.

571
00:40:25,078 --> 00:40:26,339
[SPEAKER_02]: They did scale it back to one.

572
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:26,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

573
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, leave in the HDMI.

574
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But allow me to point out that the low-end system will not even have the HDMI at all.

575
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:33,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

576
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:34,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, okay.

577
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:34,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this.

578
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:36,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't waste my money on a low-end system.

579
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:37,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

580
00:40:39,565 --> 00:41:08,363
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to, you know the memory stick thing it's nice but they should have made them use the memory sticks from the beginning or a USB thing, you know they should have had something more universal that would last, if their vision was that big they should have had it last from system to system or they should at very least use the PS2 memory cards, you know there's price reduction right there they don't need to process the polys that they're saying that they can, no one is really going to care

581
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:16,488
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they need to make sure that the games they put on there, first of all, take care of the whole anti-aliasing issue that you've had ever since the days of the PS1.

582
00:41:17,048 --> 00:41:18,088
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, fix that.

583
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:22,610
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um... Oh, God, I've got such a list in my head right now.

584
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Loki 1 Interject, anyway.

585
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,671
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something else I liked about the PlayStation 2.

586
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,272
[SPEAKER_03]: The old controllers worked on the system.

587
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the system.

588
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent the $300 or whatever.

589
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not have to go out and buy new hookups.

590
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:36,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It used the same hookups as the PlayStation 1.

591
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:38,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have to buy new controllers.

592
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, it came with one, but I didn't have to go out and buy a second one to play two-player games.

593
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I had that already because I already owned the system.

594
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Devil's Advocate, Xbox 360 didn't do that for you.

595
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:49,985
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it didn't.

596
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:52,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can use your Xbox controllers.

597
00:41:52,707 --> 00:41:53,127
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't.

598
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:53,347
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

599
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:54,883
[SPEAKER_03]: F1 Racing for the PS3 has...

600
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:20,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Use the wing mirror basically as the PSP.

601
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need that.

602
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,651
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a stupid example of the technology.

603
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:31,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask one more question and then I want to get back to the news because we've spent an awful lot of time on this unplanned Sony discussion.

604
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:32,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my last thought.

605
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:38,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Should Sony push back the release of this to save themselves?

606
00:42:38,534 --> 00:42:39,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no?

607
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,514
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to, I think.

608
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:42,807
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

609
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:03,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Gears of War

610
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:26,109
[SPEAKER_03]: and just a lot of really big stuff that's coming out for the 360.

611
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:35,115
[SPEAKER_03]: If you delay it any further, like into spring, people are already going to be snapping up the Xbox 360 and they'll say to hell with the PS3.

612
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:45,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, if they do launch the PS3 now, you're going to get a lot of unfinished games, you're going to get a lot of things that may not work right, and it's going to be one big clusterfuck.

613
00:43:45,387 --> 00:43:45,587
[SPEAKER_03]: GK128 PS3 in 2006?

614
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:46,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll eat my hat if that happens!

615
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:12,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Legend of Zaku says they need it to live or Nintendo will eat them alive.

616
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:15,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy Wonder Zero says they can't do it.

617
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandit says the PlayStation 3 is too next-gen for this gen.

618
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:26,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sakurina says recap, fuck next-generation consoles, go retro.

619
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:27,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

620
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:32,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess the Dreamcast is having a resurgence from what I understand, but anyway.

621
00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:36,326
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get back into some more news here, so let's keep it on moving here.

622
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you have some news on the Wii.

623
00:44:38,706 --> 00:44:48,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, also basically one of the big things about the Wii was that this Wii Connect 24 service that they're going to be having, they'll basically allow you to have updates.

624
00:44:48,688 --> 00:45:00,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some of the things that they're talking about is daily content, and this can be anything from DS demos to movies, etc.

625
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Just basically new content each day for you.

626
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great.

627
00:45:04,556 --> 00:45:06,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's going to happen.

628
00:45:06,597 --> 00:45:13,618
[SPEAKER_03]: That's maybe a bit optimistic, but definitely I like the idea of having DS demos on there so you can actually play that.

629
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:15,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

630
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:18,019
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that Sony should copy, to be honest.

631
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, PS3 downloadable demos, that'd be a really good thing.

632
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:33,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully, the other thing though is, I mean, granted there's only limited storage on this thing, hopefully they'll have some way to turn this off in case you don't want it, because

633
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:34,364
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

634
00:45:59,182 --> 00:46:02,585
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they are licensing to PC manufacturers right now.

635
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:06,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And we set up our launch title as Duke Nukem Forever.

636
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Might sell some systems.

637
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,073
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's supposed to be actually an on-demand game service.

638
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:17,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Deliver the games to the system in the living room through online memes.

639
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:22,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like GameTap on your TV, in a way.

640
00:46:22,348 --> 00:46:25,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Not with classic titles, but with new games.

641
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,270
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's looking like.

642
00:46:28,391 --> 00:46:32,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've changed their launch date now from mid-2006 to October.

643
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:38,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Their new CEO is basically going in saying that they're really pushing it.

644
00:46:38,557 --> 00:46:40,998
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to get the Phantom Lapboard out worldwide.

645
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a combination keyboard and mouse.

646
00:46:44,821 --> 00:46:49,165
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're saying it's on schedule for first arrivals in October for the US market.

647
00:46:49,985 --> 00:46:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now they're running at a $70 million loss.

648
00:46:55,069 --> 00:46:56,811
[SPEAKER_01]: No product created.

649
00:46:56,851 --> 00:46:59,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is why Nintendo's afraid to announce the launch date for the Wii.

650
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:01,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're shaking in their boots over this Phantom launch.

651
00:47:02,315 --> 00:47:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a hell of a... What?

652
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:04,817
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

653
00:47:04,977 --> 00:47:05,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

654
00:47:05,438 --> 00:47:06,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's what they need to do with the Phantom.

655
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:07,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what?

656
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:13,603
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to put this out and actually be successful with it and you're talking about on-demand service,

657
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you pitch it to cable companies?

658
00:47:17,153 --> 00:47:23,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Cable companies now are starting to do this on-demand crap where you can download movies and karaoke and stuff like that.

659
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:25,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not games?

660
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Just soup up their hardware right now and offer games where you can download them on-demand and play them.

661
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:32,665
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know something weird?

662
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:34,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Cable companies did this in the 80s.

663
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:39,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it was something that was just being tested locally in this market, but my cable box back in like...

664
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when the only system we had was the Atari 2600, this is before the launch of the NES, we're talking that long ago, you could get games on demand, like poker and stuff, that had better graphics than the Atari 2600, and use your remote.

665
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:53,616
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, that never took off.

666
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:55,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the Satellaview?

667
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:56,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have that.

668
00:47:57,076 --> 00:48:00,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Satellaview is what they had in Japan for the Super Nintendo.

669
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:01,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

670
00:48:01,357 --> 00:48:07,078
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zelda Satellaview, which is actually, in my opinion, the best version of the first Zelda game ever.

671
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:12,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember back in the day when they had the Sega Channel, and that was okay, but it was slow as hell.

672
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:15,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, though, with everything being broadband, I think they should do that.

673
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,340
[SPEAKER_03]: They do this in hotel rooms right now, too.

674
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I see chat rooms.

675
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,761
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Xbox Arcade.

676
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:21,481
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same difference.

677
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:23,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

678
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:30,215
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's something that they should really do, because in that way, you know, oh, I don't want to buy a game console, but, you know, maybe this game service or whatever.

679
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:34,697
[SPEAKER_03]: GameTap should fucking go in the business with these people, and, you know, I think that'd be good, too.

680
00:48:34,817 --> 00:48:36,437
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know.

681
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:46,881
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really where they need to be going, because the Phantom console as, like, a PC on-demand thing, people have done it for cheaper and better, so, yeah.

682
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:47,181
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

683
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:49,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's keep it moving here.

684
00:48:49,874 --> 00:48:52,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about the ESRB for a minute.

685
00:48:52,716 --> 00:48:55,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Penny Arcade is actually teaming up with ESRB.

686
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,240
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of interesting.

687
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabe from Penny Arcade wrote that they have been signed by the ESRB to put together a new advertising campaign meant to educate gamers about the ESRB's rating systems.

688
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:09,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to show up in magazines and websites and all that stuff.

689
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:11,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of interesting.

690
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:12,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I like...

691
00:49:12,981 --> 00:49:19,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Penny Arcade has a very funny approach to social issues sometimes, so I'll be very curious to see what they come up with for this ESRB.

692
00:49:19,865 --> 00:49:21,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be very creative.

693
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some very creative guys over there.

694
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:26,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you remember they actually had a little thing teasing at it at E3.

695
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:30,311
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably saw those pillars that they had with the characters.

696
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:41,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think any way to get the message out there is great, especially if it's something that parents can be able to use and so there's less confusion on

697
00:49:41,718 --> 00:49:43,439
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESRB works as the parents that need to be educated.

698
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:45,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hope whatever they're working on is geared towards parents.

699
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:15,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say if it's educated, if it's aimed at gamers talking to parents about what they're playing, I think that's not a bad thing either.

700
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:18,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know, that would be kind of a hard thing to market.

701
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,781
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, at Penny Arcade, they're creative, they can come up with something, I'm sure.

702
00:50:23,702 --> 00:50:28,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, let's go on over to Loki, who has news on another video game law.

703
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, and this one's in, it's been passed in Minnesota.

704
00:50:32,768 --> 00:50:35,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Their last, latest state law is basically...

705
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:43,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding, and this is interesting, finding the people that buy the game and not the sellers of the games.

706
00:50:44,192 --> 00:50:52,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, if you're a miner and you live in Minnesota and you happen to purchase an emirated game, well, the blame's going to fall on your hands.

707
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:55,017
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be fined $25 for that.

708
00:50:55,278 --> 00:50:55,998
[SPEAKER_01]: That's smart.

709
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.

710
00:50:58,253 --> 00:50:59,616
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the right approach to take.

711
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:01,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, whose responsibility is it?

712
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:02,821
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the person who's paying out the money.

713
00:51:03,202 --> 00:51:04,043
[SPEAKER_01]: They want the product.

714
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:07,469
[SPEAKER_01]: The game retailer, why should they parent other people's children for them?

715
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm fully in support of that.

716
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:13,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they're saying that they're not trying to punish gamers.

717
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:21,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, if you do get caught doing this and get fined, it would not go on your record.

718
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just you'd be fined $25.

719
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:28,325
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, though, is they were saying that they don't know how they're going to enforce it, which is, I don't know.

720
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:28,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

721
00:51:29,065 --> 00:51:30,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the right approach.

722
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:35,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, punish the people buying the games or maybe even the parents, you know, because

723
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:36,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

724
00:51:36,521 --> 00:51:40,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the fine should be, well, I don't know if it's a little bit too, you know, the right price point or not.

725
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:52,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit higher of a fine would be a bit better, but I guess it's sort of a step in the right direction instead of, you know, just trying to say, oh, let's ban all bad video games type thing.

726
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:53,310
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

727
00:51:54,715 --> 00:52:14,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of bad things and games doing bad things to children, an affiliate of Fox, a Fox 9 TV station, further proving that the media does not get games sometimes, they ran a story recently that talked about how children are using a game device to access porn out of thin air.

728
00:52:14,987 --> 00:52:17,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The gaming device in question, the PSP.

729
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:20,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, if you consider that the PSP can access the internet...

730
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:24,093
[SPEAKER_02]: and that if you listen to Avenue Q, the internet is for porn.

731
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:28,497
[SPEAKER_02]: This does not make any surprise at all that you can download porn on your PSP.

732
00:52:28,777 --> 00:52:38,004
[SPEAKER_02]: This kind of reminds me of that other story that ran not that long ago about how predators can pick up children in PictoChat, whereas I never find people chatting in PictoChat.

733
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:40,846
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just kind of one of those, is this really news?

734
00:52:41,547 --> 00:52:47,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you really understand that the PSP gets on the internet and you can get anything on the internet,

735
00:52:48,183 --> 00:52:48,824
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

736
00:53:08,376 --> 00:53:09,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

737
00:53:09,517 --> 00:53:18,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to blame Fox and use that whole thing, but really, I think there's a lot of uneducated media folks out there in general.

738
00:53:18,584 --> 00:53:24,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's easy to pick on Fox in this case, but... My favorite, though, was the Penny Arcade response to the whole thing.

739
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, with the calculator?

740
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:27,971
[SPEAKER_02]: The edge of sketch in the calculator.

741
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:28,732
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

742
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:31,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Your calculator can say boobs.

743
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:47,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of porn, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down all day long for porn, but once in a while she stumbles upon a site she wants to share with you in a little segment we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

744
00:53:48,182 --> 00:53:50,463
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, where should the kids be surfing to this week?

745
00:53:51,485 --> 00:54:00,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's website of the week is... Actually, I had one, and then there was another one that I had found earlier that I'm going to stick with because of the article I found on it.

746
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:01,928
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at livescience.com.

747
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:11,371
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to this URL, it's livescience.com slash technology slash 050201 underscore cell underscore danger dot html.

748
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:15,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's talking about how drivers on cell phones kill thousands of people.

749
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,151
[SPEAKER_01]: All the more reason to take old people off the road.

750
00:54:36,912 --> 00:54:45,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Cell phone distractions cause 2,600 deaths and 330,000 injuries in the United States every year, according to the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

751
00:54:46,577 --> 00:55:00,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Drivers talking on cell phones are 18% slower to react to brake lights, and they're also 12% greater following distance, at least that's one thing good, but they also took 17% longer to regain speed once they had a brake.

752
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:03,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, basically, it slows down your reaction time.

753
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:06,706
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you a danger to yourself and everybody else on the road.

754
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:09,989
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suggest that everybody read this article and hang up your goddamn phone.

755
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:12,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should read this.

756
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,271
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my side of the week.

757
00:55:14,472 --> 00:55:14,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

758
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:20,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to call me to talk about this, I'll be driving to the bay tonight, so I'll have plenty of time to talk.

759
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:21,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

760
00:55:22,472 --> 00:55:23,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dead serious about it.

761
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:34,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's... Having known someone who lost her child because the other driver was talking on her cell phone when she ran him over, then yeah, I definitely am very much against it.

762
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:35,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

763
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:37,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to games now.

764
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:42,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, and the continuing saga of the Wii release date.

765
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:43,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I think is interesting?

766
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:51,190
[SPEAKER_02]: If you check dig.com out this week, some story that was speculating like a November 11th launch or something got like a thousand digs or something.

767
00:55:51,691 --> 00:56:00,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of struck me as amazing because they, not to knock the story, but their source was kind of like some guy anonymously told us.

768
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:29,397
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know I realize that you know our source to some people doesn't seem much better and that's fine but I was just kind of surprised that everybody seemed to be going they were jumping at that date based off of shaky evidence well Loki has further evidence that seems to point towards October take it with a grain of salt if you want but here it is and I'd like to preface something real quick I saw there was a little story on GameSpot this week talking about Activision's upcoming titles for the fourth quarter including some titles like Pimp My Ride the Game

769
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:37,187
[SPEAKER_03]: and some Cabela's Alaskan Hunt game or something like that and other stuff.

770
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:42,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You do remember way back when I talked about this months ago.

771
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:43,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

772
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,610
[SPEAKER_02]: When was that one event?

773
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,752
[SPEAKER_03]: It was during Destination PlayStation in Florida.

774
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:49,813
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced all this stuff.

775
00:56:50,113 --> 00:56:51,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anyone pay attention to that?

776
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:51,634
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

777
00:56:51,914 --> 00:56:58,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Download the show the week of Destination PlayStation that we did, and you'll hear Loki saying this.

778
00:56:58,417 --> 00:57:06,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I get this information, and nobody pays attention to it until a big site comes and repeats the same thing, and then everyone's like, oh, okay.

779
00:57:06,742 --> 00:57:09,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, more Wii dates, of course, and guess what?

780
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:11,145
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all around the same time again.

781
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:14,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And this time we've got Activision and Ubisoft.

782
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:17,648
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit bigger companies out there should know when the Wii's coming out.

783
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:26,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, some of their games, though, like, for example, Call of Duty 3, that is on the launch date, which is great.

784
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:30,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know Call of Duty was coming to the Wii.

785
00:57:30,453 --> 00:57:34,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I mentioned that also on that same podcast about Destination PlayStation.

786
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:36,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they show that at E3?

787
00:57:36,905 --> 00:57:39,149
[SPEAKER_03]: They did, sort of, in movie form.

788
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pre-rendered movie.

789
00:57:40,872 --> 00:57:41,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, eh.

790
00:57:41,877 --> 00:57:44,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam Rayman 4

791
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:21,899
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Marvel Ultimate Alliance also coming out actually to coincide with the PlayStation 3 launch because that's being launched in every single system that day on November 16th so there's some more games for you granted not all of them are on October 18th but

792
00:58:23,188 --> 00:58:29,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we still haven't gotten a lot of the company's stuff yet and obviously you're not going to be just announcing stuff for launch.

793
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:32,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be launching with more titles.

794
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:35,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still within the launch window and it's about a week away from the thing.

795
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:47,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still sticking with October 18th and I will be laughing my ass off when this does come out on October 18th or when they come out with the news that we're launching it on the anniversary of the original Nintendo.

796
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:49,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what if it doesn't turn out that way though?

797
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,653
[SPEAKER_02]: What if they do come out and say it's November 11th?

798
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:51,373
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?

799
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then, good.

800
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:53,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out November 11th.

801
00:58:53,976 --> 00:58:54,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

802
00:58:54,976 --> 00:59:03,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's coming out this date, and granted, there's powers that may not be able to make it at this launch date.

803
00:59:03,939 --> 00:59:08,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Things can delay stuff, but it's too convenient not to happen.

804
00:59:10,742 --> 00:59:12,663
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many coincidences.

805
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:13,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

806
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:20,439
[SPEAKER_03]: With, you know, more and more publishers every day, every week, you know, agreeing that this is a time frame.

807
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:22,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice all these dates aren't all in November.

808
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:26,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not all hovering around November like it would be coming out in November.

809
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:31,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely, okay, definitely in October and most likely on the 18th.

810
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:34,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll see.

811
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:40,236
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, now you have some definite for sure release dates to share with us, correct?

812
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:41,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure do.

813
00:59:41,436 --> 00:59:43,877
[SPEAKER_02]: But now this isn't for the US, these are for the UK.

814
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:47,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Because screw the UK, I mean... You do live here.

815
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, damn it.

816
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:56,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is the release dates for our UK listeners coming up on the 9th of the following games.

817
00:59:57,259 --> 01:00:00,060
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Zoo Tycoon 2... Oh, sorry, that was the second.

818
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:00,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

819
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:25,759
[SPEAKER_01]: F-117A Stealth Fighter on PC is coming out Namco Museum 50th Anniversary on GameCube Sensible Soccer 2006 on PC Xbox, Playstation 2 and Talkman on PSP Also on the 13th we have Culpa Inata on PC That's though going to be the following Monday Alright, Loki do you have anything in the US?

820
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:31,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's lots of fun stuff coming out this coming week here Of course

821
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know, it's kind of getting to a dead part of the month.

822
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:37,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Urban Chaos, Riot Response is supposed to be coming out.

823
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that would be the following week.

824
01:00:41,476 --> 01:00:44,678
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, though, we have Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories on PlayStation 2.

825
01:00:45,438 --> 01:00:46,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And that should be good.

826
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:49,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there isn't multiplayer on it, so that kind of sucks.

827
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:56,004
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, we've got Ant 1 Streetball coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

828
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:57,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I talked about this last week.

829
01:00:57,906 --> 01:01:01,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Gradius Collection is going to be coming out on the PSP.

830
01:01:02,366 --> 01:01:03,226
[SPEAKER_03]: which is pretty awesome.

831
01:01:04,106 --> 01:01:14,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, like I said, the following week, Urban Chaos, Right Response on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology on the PlayStation 2 as well.

832
01:01:15,549 --> 01:01:21,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And, unfortunately, if you're waiting for 360 games, there's only going to be one this month, and that would be MotoGP 2006.

833
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:27,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, there'll be some more Xbox Live games, arcade games to go with that.

834
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, Luminous.

835
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:30,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping.

836
01:01:31,704 --> 01:01:32,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully anything.

837
01:01:32,624 --> 01:01:35,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Live's been kind of dead since E3 with Uno.

838
01:01:35,685 --> 01:01:36,645
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need is Uno.

839
01:01:37,145 --> 01:01:39,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno's really the only game that's really come out in quite a while.

840
01:01:39,886 --> 01:01:47,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize Uno's a pretty good release, but after hearing some of the stuff they teased at E3, I'm like, come on, bring on the Contra, bring on the Luminous.

841
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:51,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've got a few more things real quick, because there's been some shuffling going around, obviously.

842
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:53,790
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR's been moving.

843
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:55,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

844
01:01:55,951 --> 01:01:56,491
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR moved?

845
01:01:56,531 --> 01:01:57,011
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

846
01:01:57,331 --> 01:01:59,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, dates change.

847
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:00,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's

848
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:03,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Get caught up here with what's been going on.

849
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:12,225
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Supernova, not coming out on the 13th, but coming out on the 2nd now of September.

850
01:02:12,585 --> 01:02:13,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty good.

851
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:15,488
[SPEAKER_03]: They moved that up a bit.

852
01:02:15,908 --> 01:02:21,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Supernova also, I believe, moved up.

853
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:26,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's now coming out, let's see here, it was in October.

854
01:02:29,058 --> 01:02:30,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, also...

855
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:35,493
[SPEAKER_03]: One game that did get delayed, Final Fantasy XII, coming out on October 11th now.

856
01:02:36,274 --> 01:02:36,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of sucks.

857
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:40,135
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um... Wait a minute.

858
01:02:41,015 --> 01:02:41,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

859
01:02:41,936 --> 01:02:47,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that be more... Could that be something else to show that there's competition with the Wii there?

860
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:52,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Because didn't Dragon Quest VIII get shuffled to come out right on the same day as the Xbox 360?

861
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:54,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe?

862
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

863
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:57,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a very good...

864
01:02:57,992 --> 01:03:01,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wasn't very good to... But Final Fantasy XII is a great counter-title.

865
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:02,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's... Okay.

866
01:03:02,714 --> 01:03:03,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

867
01:03:03,234 --> 01:03:05,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, not super... Universe.

868
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:08,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultraman XIV, October 2nd now.

869
01:03:09,136 --> 01:03:11,957
[SPEAKER_03]: So that got pushed up a little bit the same day as Elebits.

870
01:03:12,737 --> 01:03:13,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

871
01:03:14,298 --> 01:03:25,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, we have for the 360 Universe, which is now November 2nd.

872
01:03:26,959 --> 01:03:31,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, they're really aiming on the second for a lot of these.

873
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of good games coming out, though, in the fall, that's for sure.

874
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of weird.

875
01:03:36,223 --> 01:03:37,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they all get shifted to the second?

876
01:03:37,644 --> 01:03:38,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those all even Tuesdays?

877
01:03:39,424 --> 01:03:40,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they do that?

878
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:41,345
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't come out on Tuesdays.

879
01:03:41,405 --> 01:03:42,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually Wednesdays and stuff.

880
01:03:43,446 --> 01:03:44,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh, okay.

881
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:48,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure it's not going to change again next week?

882
01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:48,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I could.

883
01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:54,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm never certain about dates until it actually gets to the week of, and even then I'm not certain sometimes.

884
01:03:55,945 --> 01:04:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, but, you know, when it comes down to Konami, they tend to really keep about the same dates for stuff.

885
01:04:02,455 --> 01:04:02,655
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

886
01:04:33,456 --> 01:04:33,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

887
01:04:33,616 --> 01:04:33,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um...

888
01:04:51,084 --> 01:05:05,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomb Raider Legend is at number 5, 6th place X-Men The Official Game, Da Vinci Code is at 8, Animal Crossing Wild World at number 7, that actually moved up from number 9, and Sims 2 is at number 10.

889
01:05:05,188 --> 01:05:12,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the debuts that came out though was Rise of Nations, Rise of Legends at 37, Super Princess Peach at 29.

890
01:05:13,991 --> 01:05:16,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically DS titles though all over the place.

891
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,992
[SPEAKER_01]: They're speculating that the new Super Mario Bros.

892
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to really show up high as well as brain training.

893
01:05:27,015 --> 01:05:28,235
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it's looking right now.

894
01:05:28,636 --> 01:05:29,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently they love Hitman.

895
01:05:30,457 --> 01:05:30,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

896
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:31,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it is new.

897
01:05:32,218 --> 01:05:34,659
[SPEAKER_03]: They mentioned in the chat that September 2nd is a Saturday.

898
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:36,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that, Loki.

899
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somebody made a boo-boo.

900
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:40,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take that with a huge grain of salt.

901
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:43,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to go back to the way it was next week.

902
01:05:43,664 --> 01:05:46,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just goes to show your database is not always foolproof.

903
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:49,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, but they're pretty close.

904
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:54,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Top Xbox 360 and Xbox Live games are out thanks to Major Nelson.

905
01:05:54,614 --> 01:05:55,775
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what folks are playing on the 360?

906
01:05:55,815 --> 01:05:58,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one game, Call of Duty 2.

907
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, Ghost Recon 3.

908
01:05:59,758 --> 01:06:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, Oblivion.

909
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:06,322
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way on down to number ten, Hitman Blood Money demo making a new entry there on the chart.

910
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar Table Tennis coming in at number seven.

911
01:06:09,104 --> 01:06:12,506
[SPEAKER_02]: The top games on the original Xbox, number one, Halo 2, of course.

912
01:06:12,946 --> 01:06:14,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, Battlefield 2.

913
01:06:14,928 --> 01:06:16,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And number three, Counter-Strike.

914
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:20,810
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way on down to Ghost Recon 2 at number 10.

915
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:24,472
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the titles, not a lot of new stuff there on the original Xbox.

916
01:06:26,672 --> 01:06:30,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I wanted to share with you guys a story coming in from Japan.

917
01:06:30,214 --> 01:06:31,994
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about the ESRB earlier.

918
01:06:32,374 --> 01:06:39,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the CERO is Japan's equivalent, and they have a new rating system that they're going to use.

919
01:06:39,437 --> 01:06:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: They have two separate ratings for M-type games.

920
01:06:43,638 --> 01:06:56,864
[SPEAKER_02]: A title gets what's called a D. Basically, there's letters A, B, C, D, and Z. A title gets a D rating if it's 17 years and older, and the Z rating is for adults 18 and up.

921
01:06:57,464 --> 01:06:58,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of interesting.

922
01:06:59,545 --> 01:07:02,827
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to know the type of games that are getting a Z rating right now, you have Killer7,

923
01:07:03,747 --> 01:07:08,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Max Payne, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, The Getaway, Berserk.

924
01:07:09,232 --> 01:07:17,939
[SPEAKER_02]: D-rated games, as in the 17 and older, you have things like Fable, Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive 4, God of War, Rumble Roses.

925
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting, this system they have there.

926
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:20,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

927
01:07:20,822 --> 01:07:23,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It's A, B, C, D, and Z.

928
01:07:24,178 --> 01:07:27,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I guess C is 15 and up and B is 12 and up and A is everybody.

929
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:34,663
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the movie rating system because 15 is basically their equivalent of the PG-13.

930
01:07:34,703 --> 01:07:35,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

931
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:39,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Battle Royale, for example, was a 15 and up movie.

932
01:07:39,485 --> 01:07:39,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

933
01:07:40,565 --> 01:07:40,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

934
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:44,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I always said for a long time we should just mirror the movie system here.

935
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:48,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised that Berserk was mentioned being that that's an old Dreamcast title.

936
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:49,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

937
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:52,371
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, though, it was pretty violent anime and manga.

938
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:53,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

939
01:07:54,146 --> 01:07:57,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, are we going to be seeing gaming at the Olympics soon?

940
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope not.

941
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:02,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, I've seen weird stuff come to the Olympics, so who knows.

942
01:08:02,654 --> 01:08:16,085
[SPEAKER_03]: But according to GameSpot, actually, the founder of the Global Gaming League is trying to get gaming as a demo sport in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and basically is

943
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:19,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to see gaming as an Olympic event.

944
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:48,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

945
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:05,625
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not an event.

946
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:06,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

947
01:09:06,826 --> 01:09:10,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they come out with a game that involves running around the goddamn track.

948
01:09:10,769 --> 01:09:14,592
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not even close to being a sport, okay?

949
01:09:14,973 --> 01:09:19,696
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to test someone's athletic ability, you've got the floor exercises for gymnastics.

950
01:09:21,178 --> 01:09:22,899
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR is nothing compared to that.

951
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakdancing would be a better sport than gaming.

952
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:32,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we have the classic witty retort from the chatroom that DDR is a sport in the Netherlands.

953
01:09:32,327 --> 01:09:32,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Norway.

954
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:32,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Norway.

955
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:46,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them Norway doesn't count Moving on DarkSakura, you have some news on Half-Life Do I?

956
01:09:47,187 --> 01:10:03,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what Half-Life is That's what the notes say I was being witty I know DarkSakura needs food badly Don't shoot food No

957
01:10:04,089 --> 01:10:07,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 is out.

958
01:10:08,052 --> 01:10:14,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Released at 6pm in the UK on June 1st.

959
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:16,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm all backwards today.

960
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:17,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's...

961
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:26,750
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about, people can play it.

962
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:35,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And you actually can, they actually had it available for a pre-purchase as well too.

963
01:10:36,975 --> 01:10:44,178
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you can pre-load it for $19.95 or you can buy it from scratch and download it.

964
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,320
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now though, they're saying the servers are pretty loaded on it.

965
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:50,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

966
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:52,535
[SPEAKER_01]: E.A.

967
01:10:52,675 --> 01:10:54,397
[SPEAKER_01]: is distributing the game for £15.

968
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:13,634
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically to Guitar Hero what Stepmania was to DDR.

969
01:11:13,694 --> 01:11:15,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Free Tar Hero is released.

970
01:11:15,256 --> 01:11:16,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available at a site.

971
01:11:17,278 --> 01:11:23,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called, I'm going to have to spell this for you guys, antonstruyk.com.

972
01:11:24,586 --> 01:11:26,187
[SPEAKER_02]: FreeTar, FreeTar

973
01:11:52,731 --> 01:11:53,532
[SPEAKER_02]: TAR HERO

974
01:12:11,351 --> 01:12:13,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things are being developed for an old platform.

975
01:12:14,172 --> 01:12:25,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Dreamcast, which is ironic because actually iGen's been doing this thing now where they're re-revealing every single Dreamcast game that's ever been made and starting off with a lot of games.

976
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:38,741
[SPEAKER_03]: But according to Dreamcast Scene, actually, Goat Store Publishing firm has announced that they have plans to release 10 more games for the Dreamcast over the next year and a half.

977
01:12:39,562 --> 01:12:39,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's...

978
01:12:40,745 --> 01:12:41,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

979
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreamcast Dreamcast Dreamcast Dreamcast Dreamcast

980
01:13:36,857 --> 01:14:04,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some of the games right now, and I don't know if these are going to be too exciting, but Feet of Fury 2, remember that DDR clone that they had for the Dreamcast, Donk, a Cryptic Illusions remake of the CDI game, DC, or DCastle, Age of the Beast Special Edition, which is basically a clone of Altered, not Altered Beast, um,

981
01:14:04,909 --> 01:14:05,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

982
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:10,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar to that Beats of Rage that came out a while back, which is the Streets of Rage clone.

983
01:14:11,491 --> 01:14:14,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Amnesia Adventure Game, a new graphic adventure.

984
01:14:14,632 --> 01:14:34,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, a new adventure game from SF Software, a remake of a cancelled Lynx game inspired by Tempest 2000, a new 3D fighter using the Quake engine, Samurai Warrior using the enhanced Beats of Rage engine, and let's see,

985
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:38,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Firestorm Shmup Super Mario Bros 2.5D

986
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:56,821
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

987
01:15:17,539 --> 01:15:21,260
[SPEAKER_02]: One of their staff reviewed it and said they played it for about 30 seconds.

988
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from being hideously ugly, the game is sort of floaty feeling.

989
01:15:25,242 --> 01:15:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the snappiness of the original.

990
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:28,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And the levels are not identical either.

991
01:15:28,643 --> 01:15:30,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cute idea but needs some serious work.

992
01:15:30,804 --> 01:15:33,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in case you're wondering where you can download this, www.plunder.com slash super-mario-bros-2-5d

993
01:15:46,969 --> 01:15:49,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved the best for last for this break.

994
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:51,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you have a story about Mac fans.

995
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:15,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And, well, their answer...

996
01:16:42,003 --> 01:16:43,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Mac users aren't really into games.

997
01:16:46,264 --> 01:16:50,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, we're not quite sure.

998
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:57,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it entirely addresses the state of Mac gaming, but yeah, that's why.

999
01:16:57,767 --> 01:16:59,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Mac users don't really like games.

1000
01:17:01,707 --> 01:17:02,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's according to who again?

1001
01:17:03,288 --> 01:17:04,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It's according to Business Week.

1002
01:17:04,448 --> 01:17:07,469
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, just making sure you get your source out there when all the hate mail starts coming in for you.

1003
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Business Week says you don't like games.

1004
01:17:11,249 --> 01:17:12,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, not surprising.

1005
01:17:14,552 --> 01:17:18,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Rini in our chatroom, who I know is a Mac fan, says, whoever wrote that isn't trying.

1006
01:17:18,495 --> 01:17:19,256
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not trying.

1007
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:21,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Business Week.

1008
01:17:25,726 --> 01:17:28,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to go to a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1009
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:34,456
[SPEAKER_02]: When we come back, we'll have plenty more news and information and that'll be coming up in just a little bit.

1010
01:17:34,636 --> 01:17:35,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.

1011
01:17:35,857 --> 01:17:40,823
