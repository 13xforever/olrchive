Tonight, June 18th, 2006, Xbox 360 gets more backwards compatibility, but someone's pissed you still can't play Psychonauts.
Rumors that Grand Theft Auto 4 will be an MMO, and could the PS3 end up in a vending machine?
Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
It's that podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about...
I'm here to help you do that.
My name is Rob Roberts, but we cannot forget the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also here every week.
Yo, what up?
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Alrighty.
And also here every single week, say hello to the one and only Loki.
Hello.
How you doing?
Good.
Awesome.
Alright, well, here we are.
It's episode number 187, so you know what that means.
We're going to have a murderous good time tonight on the show.
That's a joke somewhere in there.
Yes, and we're going to start right here, live on the air, as we participate in a co-host battle royale, of which I'll win, because I'm vicious.
Why would we do that?
I don't know, because it'd be good ratings.
I don't want to die.
We'll fake it.
For those who were listening live last week, we were talking about the Americanization of battle royale a little bit.
I don't remember if it was after the show or in the middle or something.
We were talking about Americanization of battle royale, and that whole thought still makes me kind of sad.
I don't know.
It's just, they're not going to get it right.
You know they're not going to get it right.
It is.
Completely just makes me want to go crawl into the corner and cry for an hour.
I hope it's a rumor.
I hope it's a sick, sad rumor.
It's not a rumor.
It's not the rumor.
Tumor.
Anyway, also... Yeah, the movie will be a tumor.
Also say hello to our invisible fourth guest, but they're really there.
It's our chat room over at www.orangelondradio.com.
Click on chat.
It's your guys' show, too.
We love to put in your comments and everything.
And I'll tell you what, we have some sick fans.
Because I was just talking to one before the show tonight.
We have somebody from the UK who's listening tonight.
So say hello to DigiNova, listening for the first time.
Hello.
I think there was somebody else in there that said they were listening for the first time tonight as well.
I think it was...
Anoshi, and I apologize if I butchered that name, Anoshi, Anoshi, also listening for the first time tonight.
Not from the UK, but still.
Thanks to you guys for listening.
Of course, a big hello to everybody in there tonight, listening for the first time, the hundredth time, or whatever the case may be.
Let's talk about our gaming week.
We always like to start off the show talking about the games we've been playing.
DarkSakura, start us off.
I played a number of things over the course of this week.
I got my DS Lite after the show, and so I've been playing Animal Crossing again this week.
And I've also been playing the, on the Japanese website, LocoRoco.jp, they have the demo for LocoRoco for PSP.
And I've been playing the hell out of that today.
And Osu!
Tatakai Oendan today, which is actually harder than I thought it would be.
When's Krista coming to the show?
You know, I tried to get her to come tonight, but she had to drive back to Davis.
When you two get together, it's comedy gold.
So we need her on the show.
Maybe she'll come for the big four-year anniversary next week.
We're having a fourth birthday party.
We're celebrating our... We're celebrating our... That was great radio, by the way, when you held up your fingers.
We're celebrating our entrance into preschool next week.
It should be fun.
Yeah.
I'm trying to find people to come next week.
But yeah, that's... Oh, yeah.
I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back down because I was like, eh.
I don't want to play I don't have the time to LFP I don't have the time for this today
I think there's better things to do with my time than to immerse myself into an MMO.
I don't know what you hear about my gaming week, but we'll get to that in a minute.
Addict.
Addict!
Anything else?
No.
How's that LocoRoco?
It's crack.
I love the music.
It's on drugs.
I went to the website for LocoRoco a few weeks ago, because they have a mini version of the game all in Flash, and I thought the music was so adorable.
It's cute.
It is really cute, but it's really frustrating because I find myself trying to tilt the PSP upside down, trying to tilt the world and trying to get it to go.
And then you get up to the moon and it's like, no, you have to have twice as many pieces of your body as you have now.
Well, crap.
And then you fall down the little hole.
When you split into multiple pieces, you fall down the hole and then something comes in and eats part of you.
It's like, no, you're not supposed to do that.
Spit me out.
And then that's it.
That game reminds me of an old-ass Super Nintendo game called On the Ball.
Did you ever play that?
It was like, it whored the Mode 7, that's all you did was you spun the screen, so you can't really pick up your TV and turn it, so you know, you use the L and R buttons on the Super Nintendo controller.
That's what you do on LocoRoco.
That's cool.
But it's funny, I was looking at the screen, I was like, LocoRoco.
And it's, yeah, it's all super Japanese, everything is in Japanese, so, but it's like really easy Japanese, so it's not like that hard to read it.
Everything's written in Katakana, so it's super easy.
Unless you're like me and you don't understand a lick of Japanese no matter what.
Katakana, Hiragana, I don't want to... You know the difference.
I know there's two, but that's just because after doing this show for four years and listening to you bitch about enough Japanese games, I picked up that.
My job is done.
All right.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was pretty good.
What did I play?
I played a lot of Jewel Quest and...
I actually beat the game finally, but except the thing is you have to play through like six different difficulties, which is kind of lame, but I don't know.
And then a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers.
I was going to be playing Point Blank DS, but a certain GameStop didn't have it in.
Looked at me crazy when asked for it.
Point Blank got a DS?
Who'd want that game?
That sounds cool.
It is cool.
But they're not cool.
Remember how you were talking about before in the distributor world how certain titles are broken down?
Like you have your AA titles and your A titles.
Like a AA title would be like, what, Grand Theft Auto or something really big, Halo.
And then like your A titles, which are kind of big.
and then like B title, C title.
What, is Point Blank like an E title or something, apparently?
I have it as a AAA title.
It's a long-running franchise and it would have been perfect for the DS, but apparently GameStop doesn't think that way.
GameStop's more concerned of Urban Chaos or Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.
Yeah, I can't play them on a DS, dumbass, and it's probably the only solid DS title coming out this week.
But no, they're more concerned with, you know, ripping me off on turning in my DVDs now.
by the way, they mostly, all their DVDs, they magically don't have in their system, therefore they have to give you the generic price, which is 75 cents, to which I told them to fuck off.
Actually, DVDs don't really sell, so that's... I know, our company buys them back from... Take them to a video clearance center or whatever.
I know.
Sorry, that's local.
It's so far away.
So yeah, they sucked.
No, they don't.
They pay my bills.
No, they don't.
They pay my bills.
They may pay your bills, but they don't carry point blank.
Children, games.
Well, I'm not driving all the way over there.
Loki, games.
I played through Blazing Angels.
I'm trying to beat the game so I can sell it back because it sucks.
I don't know what they were trying to do with the art style in the game, but it's really annoying because when you're flying, there's this big dark black crap on the outside of the screen that's
I don't know what it's supposed to look like.
Is it because I'm blacking out because I'm flying?
Or is it supposed to be... What?
But when I'm shooting at something, everything else gets dark on the outside and bright in the middle.
It's like I have a TV with bad contrast or something.
And it just can't fix itself.
That's what the whole game plays like.
So I don't get that.
The game is kind of retarded.
But hopefully, least achievements, there's only seven of them.
And it's pretty easy.
It's just like beating the game a couple times.
I got it for free, okay?
So I'm going to sell it back after we get all the achievements.
So is that the only reason it sucks, the graphics?
Or is it just not a fun game, or what?
The graphics and the fact that the camera is really annoying.
And the camera, a lot of times, you can lock on different planes to see where they are, so you can select a target.
The only problem is, though, there's so many planes flying around, it's hard to target anything.
And half the time, it targets the wrong thing.
It's just like Grand Theft Auto.
It targets the wrong...
Objects.
So, that's kind of annoying.
So, the camera, the graphics are really annoying.
Otherwise, it's okay.
I was playing some multiplayer on it, and that's kind of fun.
I think that's probably the only reason you'd want to get it, is just multiplayer.
But, to be honest, I'd be willing to see what Over G Fighters looks like.
That would probably be a better buy versus Blades of Angels, but I don't know.
It's an easy game, I guess.
So, that's pretty much all I played this week.
That and Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories Still Gonna be playing that game until the next one comes out Alright And each week we find more and more wrong with the multiplayer Which we'll get into later Alright
My Gaming Week, let's see.
Oh, actually, I want to go chat real quick before we go to My Gaming Week.
I wanted to point out Ari Mawson is talking about the LocoRoco English demo, which apparently is available at psp.playstation.com.
You can browse there on your PSP, and you can get the demo for the English version of LocoRoco.
Yeah, we couldn't get that to work, so we just got the Japanese one off the website.
But that's good news for people like me if I can get it to work.
So who doesn't understand, remember, a lick of Japanese.
Let's see.
There are detailed instructions for downloading on my LiveJournal.
Yeah, but not everybody that listens to the show can read your LiveJournal, so... Nope, not everybody is that privileged.
All right.
We do have a LiveJournal community, though.
It's a username, OrangeLounge, if you are a LiveJournal member.
And maybe if you ask really nicely on that community, Jamie will cross-post her instructions.
That would be cool.
All right.
Ari Mawson also wants to point out he 100%ed LocoRoco in nine minutes.
Well, you big stud.
Go you.
All right.
Anyway, MyGamingWeek.
I also played Oidan, the DS dance...
I don't know, it's going to be elite beat agents here in the US And it's going to be a completely different game Yeah, because it's very Japanese They're completely redoing the whole story, redoing the characters in it There's like these guys in suits and not the male cheer squad
They're going to have to because it's all the text, all the music.
It's not that they have to, it's that they are.
Everything is being changed.
I mean, I was saying like, because they're going to have to, if they had to translate it all anyway, I mean, they're going to have to build it from the ground up practically because it's so very, you know, Japanese.
It's like you've got the Office Lady stage and you have the...
It's actually pretty much considered a sequel, just released out over here.
Interesting.
I have only really seen the game, I think I saw it for two minutes at E3, so I didn't really get a chance to really figure out what it's all about, but it's actually kind of fun.
For those who haven't played it, it's a music game, and it plays music in the background, and you tap on the DS screen certain places, sort of in beat with the music, depending on what the lyrics are, but sometimes you trace.
Almost like in Guitar Man.
Have you played the one song, there was one song where you draw a heart, you trace a heart?
It's so cute because it's like a love song.
I only played up to the second stage.
Listening to two musics going on at the same time just gave me a headache.
I was playing on Miklatov's DS and he has them all unlocked because he's been playing that game like crazy and he told me to play this stage because there was a heart that you draw at the end.
I thought that was really cute.
It's a very simple game but it's hard.
It's a heart.
It judges very harshly.
You have to be good or it's going to penalize you big time.
So it was a lot of fun.
I'm actually thinking about importing it if it is going to be a whole lot different from the English one.
It would make it worth it.
So we'll see.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They're a lot nicer.
They're a lot brighter, a lot crisper, a lot cleaner.
And the stylus, I noticed, was a lot thicker.
It was a lot more kind of sturdy.
I mean, I'm sure you're going to lose it just as easy, but it fit a lot better in the hand.
The only complaint I have about it is the sound isn't as powerful, and that's probably because of the fact that you're putting it in a smaller box.
It's not capable of producing quite the large volume with no headphones.
But otherwise, it's a great system.
But I'm not going to buy one right now because I'm not going to be a sucker to Nintendo's... They always do this.
They'll put out new colors and then I say, oh, I want one of the new colors.
I'm holding out for the new colors is what I'm doing.
So maybe I'll get a DS Lite at that point.
But for now, I'll stick with my DS Fat.
Thank you very much.
And then also my gaming week has been a hell of a lot of World of Warcraft.
Just playing the crap out of World of Warcraft.
They actually launched a bunch of new servers on Saturday and
and I kind of like starting on a new server because I don't know there's something kind of fun about the fact that there's no uber powerful people and even though the noob areas are really crowded you know everybody's trying to work together for a common goal and it's really easy to find parties for some of the noob quests because everybody's trying to be like the first to be level 60 so that was kind of fun and I played hardcore I mean that server went up I think Saturday at noon or maybe it was Friday at noon I'm not sure
and I'm already level 13 which I'm sure some people are like oh that's nothing I can get from 0 to 10 in an hour but you know I'm not a hardcore World of Warcraft player so for me getting to level 13 in the course of a weekend took a lot of playing so I'm quite proud of that accomplishment and saddened at the same time but I'm having fun on the new server I'm playing a mage and mages are a heck of a lot of fun
Tweek thinks the DS Lite is too small
Tweek says the DS Lite is too small.
It is, you know, it feels a little different in the hands, but I was reading complaints online about the DS Lite kind of felt different.
It didn't feel right because it was too small.
I didn't notice it.
It felt fine to me, but maybe I'm just crazy.
I don't know.
Anushi's saying that I went through about two black ones until I found out about the white PSP, so kind of going back to the whole colors and releasing new systems and all that stuff.
All right, anyway.
Gaming News for the Week
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Anyways, it continues on.
No, actually, this doesn't do anything.
All this does is...
Do what people are doing already, and the parents are going to buy their games for them, and then they're going to go, I didn't know!
I didn't know that on the back of the box when it said violent content, then there's violent content in the game!
I just thought they'd seen those words on there!
It's retarded!
Most of the time...
No matter how many laws and how easily explained this to parents, they don't care.
They're just gonna give it to their children to get little Billy to stop whining, and then when little Billy goes and murders their neighbor, then they'll go, Oh my god, the games are horrible!
It's not because I didn't watch them and bought him a gun or anything, it's just because the games are... It's just people need to take responsibility for their children, and the
The government thinks that they can help us out.
Well, you know, I think they should pass breeding laws instead.
So the stupid people stop having children.
Standardized testing.
So, that's basically what's going on.
Of course, I'm sure we'll hear more about how the ESA is going to be suing them.
And so far, in the last five lawsuits or whatever, they've been deemed unconstitutional.
So, you know, it's because they get those laws, you know,
That harmful of minors, well, that's subjective, so you know what?
Who says what's harmful?
And they haven't really proven that games are harmful of minors, so I don't know.
I just have to comment here.
I love that the chat isn't saying a damn thing about the article at all.
Instead, these are the type of comments we're getting in the chat room right now.
Let's see.
YouWillBowToMe says, Loki's girl voice makes me laugh.
To which the best says, is Loki a girl?
And WonderDogHerald says, I love Loki's femme parent voice.
And Bandit says, let's pitch in to get him a training bra.
I'm glad they're listening.
I know, I'm glad they hear the message in this about this horrible, ignorant law.
Because I think a lot of parents are like this, you know, they're all, mmm, M rating, ooh, shiny!
And then, you know, just let their kids buy it.
I mean, that's what it comes down to.
Now, again, not all parents, because we have intelligent parents that listen to this program.
Yes, there are intelligent parents out there.
By the way, Happy Father's Day to the gamer dads listening tonight.
Forgot to mention.
I didn't call mine.
Playing hockey.
Playing hockey.
Jaded 2006 I think hit the nail on the head here.
It's been repeating over and over again.
I think that's why the chat room is stopping to really refrain comment.
I mean, how many times have we heard this type of story but in different states?
Where it's just, you know, let's blame the games.
Let's put this law with vague, vague, vague language as to what a violent video game really is.
And, you know, blame it on them.
Meanwhile, you know, I just saw The Omen after last...
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
All the fundamentalists.
I don't know.
To which we get the chat comment, Xander K says, Loki is a hooker.
GamePolitics.com Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineau He Who Shall Not Be Named
and it went into law.
This is the funny thing.
It went into law immediately.
There was no January 1st date, November 1st, whatever date.
It went into law ASAP.
By the way, on a side note, big congratulations to GamePolitics.com because they're getting a mention in Entertainment Weekly this week about like, it's in the section like 100 websites you should be visiting or something like that and they're in there.
And I agree, it is a website you should visit if you're a gamer.
I just find it funny, you know, Louisiana is just rampant with, you know,
basically bad political decisions where it was, you know, moving the money for levy repair to other things.
But we shall not comment on Louisiana's intelligence in the political world.
So, wow.
Don't know what else to say.
I mean, that's not really a big surprise, but it did happen and it is law in Louisiana right now, so... Thank God I don't live in the South anymore.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I feel... I liked growing up there, you know?
But...
I'm glad I got away from a lot of the backwards thought that goes on there.
Alrighty.
Speaking of backwards thought... Oh yeah, Jacky Poo.
Yes, you have an article on He Who Shall Not Be Named.
On Mr. Jackass.
That's what I'm going to call him from now on.
Either Jacky Poo or Jackass.
Right.
So, yeah.
Do you know that actually Jack Thompson is right on a few things?
You know?
What?
Entertainment... There's a list up here, actually.
Pointless Waste of Time
I think that they're, well, I look at it this way.
He's been twisting reality to suit his own purposes.
Well, we can completely just, you know, show where he is indeed right, but also show where he is wrong in his correctness.
Interesting.
Correctness would have been in quote fingers, by the way, except this is radio, so you can't see me being awesome.
So, what?
A thing.
Okay.
Yes, entertainment can change your personality.
I love how it's listed here.
Have you ever gotten sad at a movie or listened to a song that evoked a certain emotional response?
Have you been completely unmoved by any form of art?
I would think, like, have you ever seen a movie that you might think changed your life in one way or another?
Or maybe changed your outlook?
There's even a point here where they're saying, you know, actors and actresses saying, you know, that they want their movie to raise awareness on an issue.
Well, you know, so yeah, in that case, he is right.
It can affect, you know, but then again, you know, video games are no different than a movie, than looking at a painting, than looking, than reading a book.
I mean, there's a book at Walmart called Naked Murder.
At Walmart?
No one's crying about that.
Heaven forbid.
What about watching Hamlet?
How much murder is in freaking Hamlet?
How much incest is in Hamlet?
So yeah, that's completely refuted.
Okay, another point.
Cops have a right to complain.
Well, that's true.
If you're playing a game where someone's going around killing cops, if I were a police officer, that would make me a little, uh, I'd do that.
It's like the anti-lawyer killing game.
A lawyer would go, uh, or if it's like someone goes into a call center and kills everybody, I'd be like, stay away from my cubicle.
You know, so on that point of view, yeah, they have a right to be upset.
You know, wouldn't you be if someone were going around, you know, hacking off, you know, people who do what you do?
Sorry, just different songs from my childhood popped into my head suddenly.
Can I interject a little chat room humor in here?
Sure.
Fireboma says, in response to, you know, emotional response to art, Fireboma says, you mean how, like, certain music makes cowards cut themselves?
Yeah.
Emo.
Yeah.
So, now this is where he's wrong, is that, I mean, basically...
There's not too many games out there that really point that out.
I mean, you can, your games have a point.
You're supposed to accomplish certain goals in it.
You know, like the sites putting out in Grand Theft Auto, you have a choice to either go out and commit all these crimes, or you can go through the game without doing any of that.
It's not probably as much fun, but you do have the option of not doing it.
I gotta play Devil's Advocate here for a minute.
What about a game like, because I just was playing this earlier today, Burnout, where I'm encouraged to slam into other cars and I get more points when I do so, and that's really the only way to win the game.
Are you going to go out on the road and slam your car?
No, because I'm not a fucking idiot.
Okay, point taken.
It's still a choice, right?
I guess.
In that one, you're forced into that circumstance.
But in real life, you're not forced into doing anything.
If I wanted to drive my car through rush hour traffic the wrong way and slam into everybody I could, I wouldn't need a video game to probably make me do that.
Something's wrong with me anyway.
You'd need another X chromosome.
Another point was that games appeal to the worst in us moving on.
Well, more specifically, Teenage Boys.
But, you know, yeah, they make profit from Dead or Alive and from other games that are going to appeal to your average young man, you know.
But this is my favorite, favorite point.
This is where he's wrong, and it's the chart from the U.S.
Department of Justice showing crimes going down since the early 90s.
In fact, it's quite a significant plummet.
In fact, I'm going to...
Link the image to the chat room so they can look at this because I think that this is pretty awesome.
It's basically showing how, I mean, and it's a pretty severe drop.
It's crazy.
If you look at it, it's gone from over, from the, you know, 40, 50 million range.
I'm sorry, sorry, 50,000 range to dropping down under the 20s.
So yeah, Jack needs to get his head out of his ass and live in the real world with the rest of us.
Not every game also has a message to it.
I mean, Pac-Man isn't like a demonstration of drug abuse or anything like that.
It's just a game.
You do stuff.
That's it.
I mean, Grand Theft Auto isn't a game about murdering people to teach you about how to go out and be a successful killer.
It's a game with a story.
That's it.
I mean, sometimes games are just simple like that.
Stop trying to read way too into things.
That's why I think a lot of people have
Thanks for watching!
The Holodeck
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, tell me, do you learn how to clean your gun, how to aim, how to fire, how to pull the trigger, proper gun maintenance, how to actually hold the weapon?
Do first-person shooters actually teach you how to do that?
They will when NRA The Game comes out in August.
I could learn all that from a Civil War reenactment.
You can go to a freaking firing range.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There was that kid who said that Grand Theft Auto 3 made him kill people in one case, I think, in Japan where they were saying it.
This is the point that I like.
What about all of the murders that happened before the game came out?
Did it make them do that too?
I think this is great.
Okay.
They're saying with GTA 3, they showed 7 million copies worldwide and say that another million were pirated.
I'm just quoting off the site here.
So that means that when you have all of those cases, the number of murders actually blamed on Grand Theft Auto 3 out of 4 million users, that would be .00003%.
Hmm.
Where's this article again?
It's at pointlesswastetoftime.com slash games slash censorship dot html.
Read it.
Definitely read it.
This is like one of the single best articles I've seen in a long time.
All right, awesome.
Loki, we're going to go over to Loki, who has some news about a game.
There can't be anything wrong with this game.
Even the fundamentalist, the most crazy people, I don't think could find anything wrong with this game.
Right, Loki?
I dropped a crate on somebody, and Luminous made me do it, and I killed somebody.
My bad.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Warpy!
Warpy!
for the game.
You have got to be kidding me.
No, I'm not.
Where is this article?
This is on GameInformer.com.
That bastard.
So, um, isn't that wonderful?
But, um, you know what?
A big hearty fuck you to these people, because seriously, do not, this is what they're, they're crack dealers.
This is what they're doing.
They get, they put out the first game for a low price on the PSP, and, you know, now that we're all addicted, they're, we want more smack, they're gonna start charging us out the ass for it.
And I bet you multiplayer's not the only thing they're gonna charge for.
They're gonna charge for each additional song, you want any of the cool licensed songs, you're gonna have to pay for it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, exactly.
And they're saying, though, that they're going to be probably having some exclusive music for different regions and whatnot.
But I just... When I saw that, though, about the multiplayer thing, that was really kind of disappointing, you know?
So, I don't know.
I have to go to chat room because they're being really funny right now.
And our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf's in there, and he's saying...
Did you hear the story, and it's not in our show world for tonight, but maybe you guys heard about all the DS lights that got stolen in Hong Kong.
He says, well, Luminous, the crate stealers were influenced by Luminous, so ban Luminous in Hong Kong.
That's it.
So here's exactly where it says right there.
Will you be able to, this is the question, Game Informer, will you be able to play Luminous live against other people online?
Currently, we are currently working on a versus mode.
Puzzle mode will be two players online.
Okay, so you can play two players, I guess.
If you do purchase a Versus mode, every mode will have a price, but they won't be high priced.
First, you purchase the basic package of Luminous Live, and then you add Versus mode to it.
At least that's the way we have it planned right now.
We're still trying to determine if we'll package Versus in with the basic package.
Yeah, you better, because that's really stupid if you don't.

Basically, you know how in Japan you have vending machines for everything, right?
From beer vending machines to used panty vending machines to Sony's vending machines.
Well, guess what?
They're experimenting with the vending machines outside of Japan.
Apparently, they've got test vending machines out now on a limited run.
And they're going to be actually adding about seven more U.S.
locations at airports and various places.
But they're also considering opening some of these up in the U.K.
too.
So, I mean, basically, the cards are supposed to be, they use debit and credit cards.
So you put it in, pick what you want, pull it out, and it charges your card.
So what am I going to be able to buy on these machines, like PSPs?
You can get PSPs, digital cameras, CD players, games, DVDs.
Basically, they're calling them robotic stores.
UMDs?
Maybe this is Sony's way to finally breathe some life in UMDs.
No, they've got these.
They're starting to put them in train stations, and they're actually... We sell to them our distribution company.
There's an iPod vending machine in the Metreon.
Why not Sony one?
I was going to say, that's probably where Sony got the idea from.
Well, I mean... Oh, they've already had it in Japan for a while.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Where Sony saw that it could be successful is because Apple's having big success with their iPod vending machines.
And when I first heard about that, I think it was actually when your buddy Tiara in Vegas was talking about there was an iPod vending machine at the Hilton there or something.
And I was like, really?
I put a dollar for candy.
I can't imagine putting $100 in a vending machine.
Here's the only thing I have a problem with.
I hate when you put a dollar in the vending machine and your chips get stuck.
What's going to happen if I pay for a PSP and the fucking PSP gets lodged in there?
I'm going to be pissed.
I think they'd be like a robotic arm.
Because they wouldn't want to drop expensive machinery down a little hole.
There's got to be a weight trigger or something.
Because even the fancy food vending machines now have a weight trigger.
So when the food hits the bottom, it knows that something hit it.
But so far, the testing locations are in California, Georgia, and Colorado.
And I actually, I think that you can, on Sony's site, I think they might have a location listing, but I haven't had an opportunity to check that yet.
But I'm sure you can find something on Sony's website.
Probably going to be like LA, Atlanta, Denver.
Denver.
And if you want to submit a picture of yourself kicking a Sony vending machine, we'll put it in our orange laundry.
Not that we endorse it.
No.
Don't actually kick it.
Or, you know, make an obscene gesture toward it.
Don't actually kick it.
But if you want to take a picture of your foot up next to it, you know, like you're going to kick it.
Like we've had kick an Ultra K, remember?
Yeah, because we had kick the Ultra K a while back.
So now we'll do kick the Sony vending machine.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.
The top photo will win something.
The Sony vending machine actually isn't a vending machine.
It's actually the PlayStation 3 case.
Alright, alright.
Let's keep it moving.
Also, speaking of the PlayStation 3, there was a pretty...
Funny observation made this week on the PlayStation 3, and it kind of dates back to E3, but somebody was going through their E3 pictures, looking at the pictures of the Sony controller for the PlayStation 3, and looked really closely and saw that something was wrong with the select button on the controller, on the prototype there.
It didn't say select, and this is the controller that was in the glass case next to the PlayStation 3.
It didn't say select, it said surrect.
S-E-R-E-C-T S-E-R-E-C-T
A blatant error.
I don't know.
Has anybody asked Sony directly about this?
Who knows?
That's silly.
Anyway, Loki, how about the Wii controller?
The Wii controller, according to Miyamoto, not going to have a microphone.
He says it would increase the price of the console too much to justify the inclusion of a microphone.
I call bullshit though, because I mean, come on, a microphone that small can't cost anything.
I mean, it's going to be like a buck or two.
I mean, really, it's going to cost that much more.
And even still, if they want to say that they're not going to put one on there, there is a little fucking connection in the back.
You can pop in a microphone right there.
So I'm still saying... Why doesn't Nintendo just do the Nintendo thing and add it later?
They have a microphone in the DS.
It ain't...
and DarkSakura.com.
because that's going to say that you need to have a DS in order to play certain games, and they're not going to do that.
And you could do that for some games, I imagine, but I would say why not just... They could easily add a microphone to this.
Maybe it's a space issue, because the controller is pretty small, but microphones nowadays...
small electronic devices they're damn tiny and I know they can't be too expensive like a buck or two really and that's you know going and buying the parts at Radio Shack let alone what they get you know at cost so who knows you will bow to me in our chat room says they need a mic that registers blue without saying brew if you've played that's voice recognition software that has nothing to do with you know whatever all right
I just might.
In fact, you know, I think that we're not the only ones frustrated with the PS3, you know?
I think a lot of developers are pretty pissed off about it, too.
Actually, a lot of developers are leaving the PS3 to start develop on the Wii, and LucasArts is one of them.
Um, there are, uh, actually some rumors that actually they were printed in the last, uh, EGM are saying that, uh, you know, so far they're still in the rumor phase, but it seems a lot of the third party developers are kind of pissed off at Sony and, uh, have gone over to a system that they're going to be able to sell more games on.
Um, the games are going to cost more to develop for the PlayStation three.
It's not viable for them to do business on.
So a lot of areas are looking to move over, and they're saying that now LucasArts is one of them who's working on a Star Wars game for the Wii.
They want to take advantage of the controller and the sound, the speaker in the controller.
So basically, think of a lightsaber game.
If that pans out the way it describes there, that's going to be bad news for Sony.
Sony shot themselves.
I don't feel sorry for them at all.
Well, maybe they can win them back.
What can they do to win them back?
More first party games.
How about, you know, make a system that isn't complete ass.
Focus on the games, not what they look like.
More twisted metal, more violent twisted metal.
That would be the way to do it.
Guns, violence, hookers, Loki.
Lots of gun violent hooker games.
And maybe, I don't know, put out Gran Turismo that's not a port of an older one.
That might be a good start.
Alright.
Going back over to the Wii for a minute, you know, I gotta say lots of cool points.
on Nintendo.
And this is just one more kind of to add to that.
Nintendo is showing controllers for the Wii behind closed doors that resemble pads from the TurboGrafx-16, the Genesis, the NES.
Get this.
They're saying that you can actually plug these into your Wii controller and use these for the virtual console.
Now, the problem is this story is a little bit different the several times I've read about it this week.
Somebody on our forums actually posted a picture of all these things in a briefcase saying that you would be able to plug in your old controller.
So if you have old Super Nintendo controllers sitting around the house just gathering dust, you could plug these in.
There's going to be an adapter.
You can plug it into the Wii controller and use them on the virtual console.
But now other stories I'm reading say that, no, they're making new ones that resemble the old controllers.
So we kind of have a little bit of a disconnect there.
So this could all just be a bunch of crap.
Well, third party can always come out and create something like that.
Exactly.
See, third party would probably create it anyway.
But if Nintendo's doing this themselves, I love the adapter idea for virtual console.
But then you kind of think about, okay, well, would I be able to use like a Super Nintendo controller on the NES games?
Well, why not, I guess.
But, you know, Nintendo's going to have to kind of think all that out.
and how weird is that going to be to use a Sega Genesis controller to play a Nintendo game?
How weird is that going to be?
I don't know.
I think it's kind of weird.
DarkSakura going into a virtual gaming system of a different type.
Well, guess what has finally happened?
What's that?
We have seen Geometry Wars defeated by UNO.
Wait, wait, wait.
Like, people playing it, or what?
The Xbox 360 version of Uno is the highest daily demo-to-sale conversion of any Xbox Live Arcade game.
Wow.
It even topped Geometry Wars Retro Evolved.
Wow.
Yep.
It's, like, not just that.
Apparently, it's given it the SmackDown...
Basically, it's about $0.40 to $0.55 profit, I think, more per sale.
Let me look a little bit further.
But basically, they're sort of using that now.
They could make other card games and see if that tops.
Oh, goody.
Now we're going to get a sea of card games that are only going to be mediocre.
Texas Hold'em is coming in July.
You know people will be playing that.
There are a lot of poker fiends.
I won't be one of them.
I think the poker thing is kind of a little overrated.
But you know what's even going to be worse?
When the Xbox Live Vision comes out.
There is going to be so much...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Of course, any story on Xbox Live brings the mandatory comment here.
DigiNova says, I want Street Fighter on Live.
When will it come?
Did you like Microsoft's little cock tease this week?
They put up Street Fighter 2 themes and pictures, user pictures.
No game.
So when you go into the Xbox Live and you go in to download new stuff, Street Fighter 2 comes up and you go like, holy shit, finally.
And then you go in there and it's themes and gamer pictures for the low, low price of a couple hundred gamer points.
And you're like, son of a... Ah, funny.
I guess maybe they're just trying to build hype.
I don't know.
We'll see.
It'll be out when it's out.
We don't know anymore.
We're not going to try and speculate anymore.
Capcom can give a date and it'll be wrong.
Moving on.
Loki, you have a story about Grand Theft Auto 4.
Yes, the rumor...
The rumor people are saying out there is that it's going to be an MMO.
One of the reasons now that they're thinking that is because on the Rockstar Norse site, they're looking for in-game animators, level design motion editors, and network programmers.
And so they're thinking, oh, network programmer, that must mean that they're going to make it an MMO.
I hope the hell not.
Do you know how many people will play as the hooker?
Okay, listen.
Here's why this will never work.
One...
Rockstar does not know how to program multiplayer to save their life.
It is awful when it comes to Grand Theft Auto.
so awful but there's a lot to work on and they definitely need people to be doing that plus I mean if you're going to be doing multiplayer in a game like that it's probably going to be a lot more complex than you know table tennis was I don't think this says anything about it being an MMO and I don't think that they would start off with an MMO I don't know I don't think it's going to happen episodic content yes MMO no I've played table tennis online and it's fine it plays fluid
I wish they had the same people working on Liberty City Stories on the PSP.
Vice City Stories is goddamn perfect.
You think Grand Theft Auto 4 will be multiplayer in some capacity or another?
You know what?
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was live-aware, and that's it.
Because, you know, we thought the same thing with Liberty City Stories on the PS2.
They tried...
and they were unsuccessful to get it working.
So what makes you think they're going to be... I mean, maybe Xbox Live might be a little bit easier than PlayStation 3, but I'm not going to be too surprised if it doesn't have multiplayer.
I would hope, because that'd be awesome, but I don't think it's going to.
Comments on Grand Theft Auto Online.
VidPalace says it'll turn into The Sims Online, which you've probably heard us talk about on the show before.
Just basically turn into Drugs and Sex, Sims Online.
YouWillBowToMe says, I want to play as the guy who works at the chicken joint in a Grand Theft Auto MMO.
Well, the multiplayer in the PSP version, I like the modes that they have.
If they worked right, it'd be great.
Because, you know, eight-man, six-man teams or whatever, that'd be perfect.
Just doing a simple deathmatch like any other game.
It doesn't have to be a full-blown MMO.
Just make the modes work correctly, and then it'll be great.
Alright, well, speaking of MMOs, there's been another rumor going around the internet this week about Blizzard MMOs and that Blizzard is going to turn into this MMO-only company.
And basically what happened is that F13.net did some type of presentation to Wall Street and a rep from Vivendi said, all Blizzard franchises will become MMOs, to which StarCraft fans and Diablo fans everywhere pooped their pants simultaneously when they heard this.
Loki, you think there could be any truth in this?
No, because Blizzard actually, when GameSpot questioned them about this whole rumor, they said, Alas, for those yearning for a marathon World of Starcraft session, Blizzard moved quickly the quash rumors of any non-World of Warcraft MMOs.
No, that's just a rumor, and
We believe that rumor circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of information provided to industry analysts.
And if I remember correctly, they had slides that basically showed potential for these games to grow in those areas, not necessarily guaranteeing that they will grow in there.
I'm sure I'm going to piss off some Blizzard fans by saying this, but I don't care.
But isn't World of Warcraft just Diablo MMO with Warcraft characters?
Pretty much, yeah.
You already have your Diablo MMO.
I don't know what's wrong.
StarCraft maybe.
I mean, that might be kind of cool, I guess, but it'd be pretty much the same.
At least that's what I think.
All right, Loki.
Now, speaking of MMOs, we see these stories come up once in a while, but they're banning more gold sellers, or what's going on?
They've suspended more than 250 accounts.
And according to them, they... Wait, is this World of Warcraft or is this something else?
This is Final Fantasy XI.
They've suspended 250 accounts and have retrieved some $250 billion in gil that's been removed from circulation as response to this.
So that's a lot of gil.
But...
I'm kind of leaning towards a no.
I had stuff to do!
Now, Final Fantasy XI isn't the only game where this is happening.
It is happening in World of Warcraft as well.
Blizzard has banned more than 30,000 accounts during May alone for gold farming.
Here's a quote.
In keeping with Blizzard's aggressive stance against cheating in World of Warcraft, we banned over 30,000 accounts in the month of May, and with that removed over 30 million gold from the economy across all realms.
The banned accounts were taking part in activities that violate the game's terms of use...
including using third-party programs to farm gold and items, which severely impacts the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.
So it looks like there's steps going on in a lot of the big MMOs to boot the gold farmers.
Kind of interesting, but what's also interesting about that, let's see, if we take 30 million and divide that by 30,000, that's 1,000 gold a person about that was taken out of the economy, but...
I don't know.
I know a lot of people who are really, really addicted to World of Warcraft at their level 60s that a thousand gold is attainable for the normal player.
You know what's funny about all of this?
Everyone's always saying, you know, this gold farming is funny.
It hasn't really had any effect on the prices of gold.
And I remember every now and then, just out of curiosity, I would go and look over at IGE to see how much they're selling gold for and stuff.
And the prices just keep dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping.
I'm not sure if that's because they can't sell it anymore.
I would think because there's more out there, they would have to drop the prices.
Well, what's interesting, too, about World of Warcraft is there's so many realms.
There's so many realms now.
It's got to be hard.
They've added more.
Yeah, right, because they've added the new one I just started on.
Airy Peak is the one I'm playing on now that just opened up over the weekend.
And, you know...
DarkSakura.com
And DarkSakura, where should all the kids be pointing their browsers this week?
This spoke to my special places.
It's a site called... I'm sure it did.
Well now.
No, that's stuck in my head because I've been still going to Weebles every day.
Is this show going to need the explicit tag on it?
No, no.
Okay, last night I was on Weebles stuff watching one of the Weeble and Bob episodes that had that stuck in my head.
But anyway, that's not my side of the week.
That was an old side of the week.
Still awesome site, though.
The site of the week this time around is eskadub.uncreativity.com The Catastrophe of Escaflowne.
Which is fabulous.
But the specific, specific thing on here is if you go under their downloads page, click on Sephiroth's Sexy Choir.
You just have to watch it.
It's a link to YouTube.
It's Sexy Roth.
With Aerith's Death of Vision.
It's a hilarious video.
So well done.
And I guess it's... There's a couple cosplayers.
It looks like they filmed it in an anime convention.
I have no idea where this... There's like a squall cosplayer.
Yeah, you can clearly see a squall cosplayer.
And they're singing the One Wing Angel, but it's sexy Roth and they... He's got a flat ass.
He's got a sexy ass.
But the Death of Vision is the best part.
The Earth Death of Vision is great.
My favorite line.
Way to stand there, Cloud.
So yeah.
Because while the choir is singing, just so you guys know, because this is radio, so it's hard for us to explain, but they've got like this, they play that death scene from Final Fantasy VII over and over again.
Well, we want people to go to the site.
I don't want to get into copyright things.
Go to the site.
Yeah.
But they play that, they loop that sequence from Final Fantasy VII where Aerith dies over and over again and then like put different filters on it, like black and white and then trippy color and sepia and all this stuff.
This is crazy.
I love Aerith Death of Vision.
That's great.
Genius.
Pure genius.
Congratulations, kids.
That's my side of the week.
I approve of DarkSakura's side of the week.
So again, the site is escadub.uncreativity.com Go click on downloads.
You will not regret it.
It'll make you fall out of your chair.
Do not be drinking Mountain Dew when you watch this, or it will end up on your monitor.
Does it say that on the site?
No.
Oh, that's what happened to you?
A friendly warning.
I don't know how I would come up with that.
Other than I snorted Mountain Dew out of my nose.
You're welcome, because I gave that link to Jamie to begin with.
I hate you.
But not really, I lied.
Hopefully you had some Windex.
Loki, let's talk Guitar Hero.
Boy, talk about this game never calms down.
People just love their Guitar Hero.
Exactly.
And if you love the Guitar Hero game, you're going to love the Guitar Hero third-party controller being put out by Lixang, and it's called the Shredder.
It looks very similar to normal Guitar Hero guitar, except a little bit more metal, I would say.
The shredder... Yeah, it looks pretty neat.
I don't know.
What do you think, Jamie?
They had it on... It looks like it's trying to be a really deformed Gibson Thunderbird.
I want to smash it on stage.
I'm sorry, the shredder makes me think of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Maybe all that hardware for making coleslaw.
Perhaps.
It is quite steep, though, in price.
$48.90 was what the exchange rate ends up being.
A lot of price for aesthetics.
I would like to point out it took about three seconds for somebody in the chat room, Brack2000, to come up with a punchline.
What will they come up with next?
The Krag?
I'm sorry, the Krang?
The Krag is a different show.
If they do a drum game, then they'll come out with the foot.
Oh my god!
Boo!
Get off the show!
Get off!
Uh-uh.
Actually, a quote from someone who can't get into the chat room.
To the Shredder, I say, tonight we dine on turtle soup.
Anything else on the Shredder?
That was from Tiara, by the way.
Anything else on the Shredder, Loki?
It looks stupid.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
GameCube, Tenchu, Time of the Assassins on PSP.
and, uh, I'll go ahead and jump to the 30th, which I will be repeating next week, but there's also a Def Jam fight for New York and the new Super Mario Bros.
So, uh, that's exciting.
New Super Mario Bros.
is pretty darn cool.
Glad you guys are getting it.
Eh, Magic kind of wore off after a few days, I don't know.
Hey!
Mario!
It's a good game and all, but I don't know, just kind of... Mario is hotness.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm more excited about the GameCube with the Super Paper Mario.
That looks hot.
Speaking of Mario, I noticed something today on my new shiny DS light screen.
Yes?
Well, with the increase in brightness and resolution on it, I noticed that if you have the arcade machine in your house in Animal Crossing, it's Mario vs. Luigi on a fighting game.
That is a hell of a lot of detail to notice.
Good job.
You have no life.
You know what?
Hi.
Uh...
What's coming out for our friends here stateside, Loki?
A whole lot of nothing.
Unless you like NFL Head Coach, in which case that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.
There's some folks that are into that.
We may not talk a lot about sports games, but there you go.
Okay, I'm not knocking sports games.
This is a sports strategy game.
You don't get to play the teams, you get to coach them.
Oh.
That's even like some sports fans won't even touch this.
Never mind.
But anyways...
Although, there is MotoGP 4, which is coming out on PlayStation 2.
Tomb Raider Legends, finally making it to PSP.
And Legend of Heroes 2, The Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch, also coming to PSP.
And for your DS fans, Sudoku Mania, yay, and Break Em All is going to be coming out.
And those are pretty lame.
Next week's going to be some good stuff, though.
I'm going to have to get one of the games that's coming out, even though I don't have an Xbox to play it on.
What's that?
Krusty Demon's Freestyle Motocross.
I've never heard of this.
Okay, this game is like a cross between Tony Hawk, an off-road game, and Flat Out.
Basically, it's like BMX XXX with motorcycles, is what it's like.
It's...
Fantastic.
You get points for injuring your rider, and it's just really cheeseball.
All right.
I'll tell you what, Loki.
Since I need to hang on to Oblivion a little while longer, I'll let you borrow the big green brick if you want to have an Xbox for a little while.
I have my big green brick outside.
Well, I have to pick up the game first, so I'll bring it over, and we'll see.
All right.
Sounds fair.
DarkSakura, we were on UK just a second ago, and there's actually a story that kind of affects them that you had.
Why, right, um, actually, uh, I can never pronounce this right, if it's Gamas, or Gamas, I would assume Gamasutra given Kamasutra, but, um, anyway, uh, a series of- We like it better that way because it's sexier.
It's so hot.
I mean, just, uh, special places.
Anyway, um, the, uh, video store, uh, Game, a big, uh, retailer in the UK, is going to be, uh, changing its, uh, return policy for software-
Right now basically a customer can return a game within 10 days as long as the packaging is complete but regardless of whether it's been opened or used now it's going to have its own seal on the packaging and if that seal is broken you will not be able to return it if it's broken within I believe 28 days.
Hmm.
I'm trying to see if there's a date on there.
Okay, this says that basically... I don't see the date when it's actually supposed to be rolling into effect, so I suppose it's already going into effect.
There's 700 owned and franchised stores in Europe.
There's 23 in the UK alone, 81 in continental Europe.
And basically, this is enacted because a lot of their profits went from 20 million pounds to 8.4 million.
That's basically in the series of 12 months that ended at the end of January this year.
So basically, they're enacting this, I'm pretty much guessing, to save their financial butt.
All right.
Hmm.
OrangeLoungeRadio.com One of the top games in Europe is a soccer management sim.
What do you do?
Soccer sounds like an abuse term.
Bandit would like to clarify, when I was offering to let you borrow the big green brick, is that an Xbox Halo edition?
Yes, it is.
That's when I finally caved and bought an Xbox.
That's when I have to, when my old Xbox died.
For quite a long time, I would not get an Xbox.
I thought they were crap.
I was of that school of thought where all the games that were on Xbox was nothing I was interested in, and then finally I caved right about the time the Halo Xbox had come out, and I thought, ooh, it's a pretty green one, too.
That's even better.
So that's when I finally caved and bought it.
All right.
Let's keep it moving here.
Loki has one more story for this segment.
And Bricks may or may not be involved in this.
Yes, Loki?
That's correct.
Uybol challenges you.
You, the bad reviewer.
No, basically Uybol has put out a press release saying that he wants to fight the people that are criticizing his movie.
His position?
I am fed up.
I am fed up with people slamming my films on the internet without seeing them.
Actually, they do still suck even after you watch them.
Many journalists make value judgments on my films based on the opinions of one or two thousand internet voices.
Half of the... Because one or two thousand people on the internet don't mean shit.
Okay, first off,
They kind of have a pretty good system there where you can't vote until the movie comes out.
So that's kind of invalid.
And two, it's IMDB.
Who gives a shit what your rating is on there?
It's a completely subjective website.
It has nothing to do with... It doesn't get published in a paper or something like that.
Who cares?
Well, anyways, it goes on.
So, it says, Ui is now challenging the critics that have failed to watch his films prior to reviewing or commenting to put up or shut up.
Towards the end of filming Postal, the five most
Outspoken critics will be flown into Vancouver and supplied with hotel rooms.
As a guest of Ui Bowl, they will be given the chance to be an extra slash stand-in in Postal and have the opportunity to put on boxing gloves and enter a boxing ring to fight Ui Bowl.
Each critic will have the opportunity to bring down Ui in a five-bout match.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
or at least two extremely negative articles in the year 2005.
Critics of 2006 will not be considered.
Please submit proof of your negative reviews and comments via email to info.bull.kg.com
KQ.E So you're being rewarded for bashing Uibo films by being in an Uibo film?
He's going to box you, but here's the thing that he forgot to mention.
He used to be a boxer, so that's not exactly fair.
By the way, you have to weigh between 140 and 190 pounds.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I bet having a chick put her application in there, I bet that would be... You want to do it?
For the sake of the show, you want to fight him?
She's grinning.
I'll do it, and I'll watch his movies so I can be critical of them.
I'll be like, I wasted those four hours.
I want you two to figure it out.
Which one of you two is going to put in the application?
Because I'm too fat to fight him.
To be perfectly honest, I actually...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Boot Camp Training.
That was fun.
It looks like our chat room approves, so we'll see.
So we're going to see what we can do to put together an application.
I'm supposed to be joining a gym next week.
