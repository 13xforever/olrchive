00:46.160 --> 00:49.440
the day so check out the schedule over there on allgames.com for more

00:49.440 --> 00:53.640
information on that. Meanwhile let's get back into the gaming news. We're going to

00:53.640 --> 00:58.680
start off with news on a anticipated Xbox peripheral, right Loki? Yes, the Xbox

00:58.680 --> 01:04.320
Live Vision camera. Major Nelson has announced that it's going to be coming to both the

01:04.320 --> 01:10.720
European and North American markets on the 19th of September and of course this

01:10.720 --> 01:15.960
also ties in with the upcoming update which will add more functionality to the

01:15.960 --> 01:20.400
for the camera on live. Supposedly you're going to be able to actually use the pictures

01:20.400 --> 01:26.280
that you take as gamer tags. So that's kind of neat. You can use the pictures on there

01:26.280 --> 01:32.960
instead of what they have. Which also opens it up for a lot of really naughty things on

01:32.960 --> 01:39.200
there. And of course if you have UNO right now you can also use it in that. And one of

01:39.200 --> 01:42.760
the bundles that actually has been rumored out there is they're going to be bundling

01:42.760 --> 01:45.060
UNO with the camera so it's kind of neat.

01:45.060 --> 01:48.400
I like that some of the game blogs have been kind of bringing up the point

01:48.400 --> 01:52.400
what the hell are you going to do with a camera in UNO? I mean

01:52.400 --> 01:56.080
look at my ugly face while I play UNO. I mean what...

01:56.080 --> 01:59.960
Well there's nothing to it. You're talking about one of the people testing the camera right now and what

01:59.960 --> 02:03.240
they did is they put it on their dog. So you see their dog panting just going

02:03.240 --> 02:06.920
heh, heh, heh, heh. I think that's great

02:06.920 --> 02:10.400
because I mean I don't know

02:10.400 --> 02:15.100
They had some like this, they had the itoy chat, but it's a game, you had to buy it,

02:15.100 --> 02:16.340
and that was lame.

02:16.340 --> 02:20.420
I think they should have totally done this before a lot of this stuff.

02:20.420 --> 02:26.660
What I want to know, how many games of Strip Uno are we going to see, because that's really

02:26.660 --> 02:32.100
the only practical use of this peripheral that I can think of is Strip Uno, you know,

02:32.100 --> 02:33.100
and voice-chatting.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.100
Does it do voice-chatting?

02:34.100 --> 02:39.220
Yeah, you can use voice-chat, and you can do video chat and stuff.

02:39.220 --> 02:43.800
Well, that might be kind of cool, because you might hear when you get a draw for a while

02:43.800 --> 02:44.800
to get some...

02:44.800 --> 02:45.800
So people...

02:45.800 --> 02:46.800
Fuck you!

02:46.800 --> 02:54.260
People can actually do, imagine if you will, over live, you could have video phone sex.

02:54.260 --> 02:58.080
If you ever wanted to show your naughty bits to strangers, here you go, because you know

02:58.080 --> 02:59.080
you can find...

02:59.080 --> 03:05.780
But please, 18 and over only, how are they going to stop slutty 17 year olds from doing

03:05.780 --> 03:06.780
this?

03:06.780 --> 03:07.780
I don't want to see that.

03:07.780 --> 03:12.420
you know I don't really want to know how they're going to try to stop them but that's still

03:12.420 --> 03:15.780
going to make for a more interesting game and it's like ah I'm quitting I guess they'll

03:15.780 --> 03:20.460
get warned I guess they figure the community will police itself it's like you know they're

03:20.460 --> 03:25.420
going to use the peripheral to be able to map your face on characters like say for example

03:25.420 --> 03:31.140
playing multiplayer Rainbow Six Vegas or whatever oh look he has a penis for a head that's interesting

03:31.140 --> 03:37.460
exactly how many boobs are you going to be playing against literally going to the chat

03:37.460 --> 03:42.260
chat room over at orangelaunchvideo.com, click on chat, Guinness Goblin says we strip Uno,

03:42.260 --> 03:53.300
fat naked gamers, Amplitude One says strip Monopoly, I think, over in the chat room there,

03:53.300 --> 04:00.540
well they are coming out with poker later, so we'll see, alright, also that's not the

04:00.540 --> 04:05.400
only peripheral that's coming out for the Xbox 360, there's apparently a mole within

04:05.400 --> 04:09.640
the uh... microsoft organization that has some news on other things that are

04:09.640 --> 04:11.440
coming out and this all makes sense

04:11.440 --> 04:15.720
uh... new face plates with halo forza 2 and viva pinata are gonna be on their

04:15.720 --> 04:16.440
way out

04:16.440 --> 04:20.080
a wireless headset is coming out but as far as i know

04:20.080 --> 04:23.320
i was listening to another podcast i want to say it was all games interactive

04:23.320 --> 04:24.960
where they bought

04:24.960 --> 04:29.440
scott for his birthday a headset that was wireless so this must be the

04:29.440 --> 04:30.320
official

04:30.320 --> 04:33.480
microsoft headsets coming out but you can already get a non-official one

04:33.480 --> 04:37.260
They have some pretty cool looking ones that are out right now, but the new wireless one

04:37.260 --> 04:40.700
is kinda nifty looking. It's like, I don't really know how to describe it.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.560
Do you really need a wireless headset though? I mean, maybe for DDR.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.420
Again, I don't talk to people when I play DDR. They'd hear me going,

04:46.420 --> 04:51.300
heh, heh, heh, heh. I think it would be nice to have one, just

04:51.300 --> 04:55.880
maybe just to see if, you know, the wireless headset is any better than the normal

04:55.880 --> 04:56.640
headset, because

04:56.640 --> 05:01.180
the normal headset kinda sucks. A wireless gaming receiver is coming out too for twenty

05:01.180 --> 05:03.280
bucks. I wonder, does that mean like a router?

05:03.280 --> 05:12.280
No, that receiver is actually for your PC, it's going to plug into the USB, it's so you can use your wireless controllers and peripherals with your PC.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.280
Oh, okay. Oh, that's kind of neat. I like that.

05:15.280 --> 05:20.280
And a 256 megabyte memory unit for those of you that are actually using memory units. All three of you.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.280
Just spend the extra money and buy a hard drive. Seriously?

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
Seriously.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.280
Loki, some controversy in the Xbox 360 community, yes?

05:29.280 --> 05:33.920
Yes, yes, Peter Moore said something retarded, basically gamers don't care about backwards

05:33.920 --> 05:36.560
compatibility.

05:36.560 --> 05:43.000
And he says nobody is concerned about backwards compatibility.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.640
We under promised and over delivered on that, which if I remember correctly, no they didn't.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.740
And it's a very complicated thing, very complex work, I'm just stunned that we have hundreds

05:52.740 --> 05:55.260
of games that are backwards compatible.

05:55.260 --> 06:00.220
He also added, um, more are coming but at some point you just go, there's enough, let's

06:00.220 --> 06:01.340
move on.

06:01.340 --> 06:06.580
Or people aren't as worried about game being backwards compatible.

06:06.580 --> 06:11.800
And I like to think that we've upheld our end of the bargain in making at least two

06:11.800 --> 06:13.940
or maybe three hundred games backwards compatible.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.980
No, I actually believe you said you were going to make them all backwards compatible, so

06:16.980 --> 06:20.340
wouldn't that be

06:20.340 --> 06:23.460
upholding your end of the

06:23.460 --> 06:25.260
bargain there at all.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.900
And

06:26.900 --> 06:27.780
you know what?

06:27.780 --> 06:31.660
That's pretty poor that they don't have all the games backwards compatible because

06:31.660 --> 06:32.860
other systems can do it.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.620
PlayStation 2 had no trouble doing it and

06:35.620 --> 06:37.940
you know I understand that they are emulating,

06:37.940 --> 06:39.780
you know, granted another

06:39.780 --> 06:41.860
graphics card set or whatever but

06:41.860 --> 06:45.140
who cares, that's your problem not mine. That's right, it's your problem for doing that.

06:45.140 --> 06:48.760
and I you know what PlayStation 3 here's one good thing at least I can say about

06:48.760 --> 06:50.340
PlayStation 3 if it truly is

06:50.340 --> 06:53.580
backwards compatible with all PlayStation 2 and 1 games that's a huge

06:53.580 --> 06:58.780
bonus and now what about the people now that say why do you buy a new console to

06:58.780 --> 07:01.340
play all your old games on what would be a response

07:01.340 --> 07:05.900
to people that are saying that? Well for example when you have one game coming

07:05.900 --> 07:08.060
out in the month and you may not want that game

07:08.060 --> 07:11.860
you know what it's nice to be able to buy some older games also drives more game

07:11.860 --> 07:14.580
sales because now there's more games you can play instead of

07:14.580 --> 07:19.660
you know, maybe the thirty or forty that are out right now, you can go and play

07:19.660 --> 07:21.460
three hundred.

07:21.460 --> 07:24.540
And for those that may have limited shelf space too. Exactly.

07:24.540 --> 07:28.460
And also you bought a new system, you know, maybe you sold your Xbox, maybe it took

07:28.460 --> 07:29.860
you know, a

07:29.860 --> 07:32.780
dump and just like basically you know, failed on you.

07:32.780 --> 07:36.620
And now you have a new system and you want to be able to, or for example, you know, what

07:36.620 --> 07:39.780
they should have done since, you know, PlayStation 2 is backwards compatible with all the

07:39.780 --> 07:41.240
PlayStation 1 titles.

07:41.240 --> 07:46.380
Say, for example, you have an Xbox game that comes out and you want to play it, you know,

07:46.380 --> 07:51.220
and that might not be on the 360, like, say, for example, The Godfather, because the 360

07:51.220 --> 07:55.120
version hasn't come out yet, and maybe you want to play that game, oh, well, you can't,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.980
because it's not backwards compatible.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.980
I don't know.

07:58.980 --> 08:03.420
Granted, there is a point, you know, where you just have to say, you know, forget it,

08:03.420 --> 08:08.780
but I, I don't know, unless they make a portable system that plays the old Xbox games or something

08:08.780 --> 08:10.780
like that, you know, you never know.

08:10.780 --> 08:18.220
Moving on, on a related note, there is a backwards compatibility update coming in the next couple

08:18.220 --> 08:21.460
weeks to Xbox Live.

08:21.460 --> 08:25.280
It is actually coming out, this was announced on the Gamerscore blog, somebody from the

08:25.280 --> 08:29.300
Microsoft team said that there is a backwards compatibility update coming out within the

08:29.300 --> 08:34.460
next few weeks, quote unquote, but at the same time, I seem to recall hearing that that

08:34.460 --> 08:38.880
download things in the background patch was coming out last week and that didn't happen,

08:38.880 --> 08:42.840
So I would imagine it's possible that the backwards compatibility thing will be pushed

08:42.840 --> 08:43.840
back.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.240
No word on what games are going to be backwards compatible.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.240
So we don't know.

08:47.240 --> 08:51.120
I don't know if you're going to get your beach volleyball yet, or you need your guide.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.480
Well that's the thing that's really sad is all these updates have come out.

08:54.480 --> 08:57.600
We had one that added most of the Tom Clancy games.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.520
We had another one that added three other games.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.200
What happened to updates every month?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.200
What the hell?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.200
I mean, that's pretty sad.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.720
I feel sorry for the backwards compatibility team, because it feels like we're picking

09:08.720 --> 09:13.300
on them a little bit, but probably they're just under, like, uh, they probably got under

09:13.300 --> 09:14.340
budgeted or whatever.

09:14.340 --> 09:17.480
They're probably working their butts off, they just don't have the resources to do it.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
It is not their fault.

09:18.480 --> 09:23.320
I'm just saying, you know, don't promise that you're going to have updates every month.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.800
Don't promise that you're going to have all the games backwards compatible, if you're

09:25.800 --> 09:26.800
not going to do it.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.160
Say, we're going to support the major titles, and that's it.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.680
More and more will be coming, you know, as the year progresses.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.240
That's what you need to do instead of saying, yeah, all the games are going to be backwards

09:37.240 --> 09:42.380
compatible and because basically you're lying you know it's like buying say if I

09:42.380 --> 09:46.140
went out to buy a car right now and they promised me that that car is gonna fly

09:46.140 --> 09:53.220
okay eventually well that's a blatant lie I mean granted technology may come

09:53.220 --> 09:57.380
out that may allow my car to fly one of these days but uh if that's not

09:57.380 --> 10:00.780
something that you're currently working on doing or you know have no plans on

10:00.780 --> 10:07.780
doing, then don't fucking promise it. Simple as that.

10:09.920 --> 10:14.580
Moving on, Loki has some further news from Microsoft. Well, kinda. This is more a rumor

10:14.580 --> 10:18.180
department, but this is a rumor that keeps coming up in regards to Microsoft, isn't it?

10:18.180 --> 10:25.380
Yeah, we talked about it a while back. I don't remember what podcast it was on, but anyways.

10:25.380 --> 10:31.420
there's a group, the diffusion group, that's saying that Microsoft is planning on launching

10:31.420 --> 10:38.420
a portable game system in the market in 2008. And basically they're giving the 360 some

10:38.960 --> 10:45.260
time to pick up steam. Possibly, I wouldn't see why they wouldn't. I mean, cause that's

10:45.260 --> 10:49.640
a market that, you know granted Nintendo's doing pretty good in, Sony's doing okay in,

10:49.640 --> 10:54.200
they're not really I mean it's not anything that's you know totally

10:54.200 --> 10:58.220
dominating the market they don't have any you know must-have games people

10:58.220 --> 11:05.000
aren't going out there and just dying to get a PSP because of X game on there so

11:05.000 --> 11:10.220
sure why not I don't know now wait a minute I said I know what show it was on

11:10.220 --> 11:12.920
that you talked about this for was right before III because you brought some

11:12.920 --> 11:16.900
story in from a business magazine saying X player or something what happened with

11:16.900 --> 11:18.920
That's what I think that they were talking about.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.760
It's the same thing.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.420
It's some team that they had working on,

11:22.420 --> 11:26.060
developed the 360 or something that was working on this.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.440
And I wish I had that magazine,

11:28.440 --> 11:29.700
but I threw it out a while ago,

11:29.700 --> 11:31.420
so we'd have to dig through the podcast

11:31.420 --> 11:33.020
to find exactly what I said.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.980
But that's basically it, yeah.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.180
They're working on something.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.860
If anything, you'll probably see it at E3

11:39.860 --> 11:42.540
or next year or the year after that.

11:42.540 --> 11:43.380
Interesting.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.100
Be a very interesting move by Microsoft.

11:45.100 --> 11:48.220
Alright, let's get away from Microsoft for a little bit. Well, actually, this is a game

11:48.220 --> 11:53.320
that you can play on the 360 among other systems. DarkSakura has a little bit of news on Final

11:53.320 --> 11:55.040
Fantasy XI. Yes?

11:55.040 --> 11:57.400
Yep. We all like our chocobos, right?

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
Mm-hmm.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.540
They're tasty.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.540
Stop it.

12:00.540 --> 12:05.420
They go good with honey sauce. Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, fine.

12:05.420 --> 12:11.740
Squeenix is talking about raising your birds. Yep. On the official site, they basically

12:11.740 --> 12:16.260
we're comparing chocobo raising to gardening something that would require a

12:16.260 --> 12:21.500
little bit of your time for one to three months you begin by finding an egg

12:21.500 --> 12:25.620
actually that sort of makes me think of Ragnarok you know you find your egg and

12:25.620 --> 12:30.940
then you have to but this in this way though you care for your egg by spending

12:30.940 --> 12:36.700
you know by helping it hatch you use certain items to help it and then you

12:36.700 --> 12:42.100
feed it and you spend time with it and you raise your baby chocobo and you name

12:42.100 --> 12:47.100
your chocobo and apparently you'll just be able to do all kinds of stuff with

12:47.100 --> 12:51.100
your chocobo that I'm not at liberty to discuss because it sounds kind of

12:51.100 --> 12:55.900
strange but you can apparently breed your chocobos with your you don't sleep

12:55.900 --> 12:59.100
with it do you because that's really gross imagine like living in your

12:59.100 --> 13:01.100
going, Mommy!

13:01.100 --> 13:03.100
Work, work!

13:03.100 --> 13:07.100
But it should be coming up on the next update.

13:07.100 --> 13:11.100
Interesting. Now I believe I was reading something about it, you have to check it every day.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.100
Yeah.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.100
So this is just a way to suck you into the game.

13:14.100 --> 13:17.100
You know, play me every day and get something cute.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.100
Addict, addict, addict, addict.

13:19.100 --> 13:24.100
Although I did also read something that there will be a way where you can get, like if you're going on vacation or whatever,

13:24.100 --> 13:26.100
somebody can babysit your chocobo.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.100
Yeah, like a chocobo sitter.

13:27.100 --> 13:57.020
Sitter. They should have the Chocobo Kennel. But it costs money. Like on, remember, on um. Oh, Nintendogs. What was it? Neopets. Oh. How you could, you know, if your animals were all dying, you could just like, you know, put them in the kennel. Mmm. We're all fed! You don't have to take care of them. While also thinking of Nintendogs. You could put your, uh, dogs that you didn't want anymore. You could take them to the kennel. Yeah. Or they could be put down. That's the pound. They'll put them down if you leave them there for too long. That's a scene in Nintendogs. Mine all ran away. That's a scene in Nintendogs.

13:57.020 --> 14:04.020
and ten dogs that we needed. And ten dogs where your puppy gets, you know, rabies. Gotta

14:04.260 --> 14:11.260
put him down, son. Alright, Paul, let me do it! Moving on, Loki, you have some news about

14:12.620 --> 14:19.620
another very popular RPG. Yeah, Oblivion's getting yet another add-on, which is excellent.

14:19.620 --> 14:35.620
The new add-on is basically a quest that revolves around finding a powerful mage who has set off in search of the Daedric artifact, Mephruun's Razor.

14:35.620 --> 14:44.620
And basically the razor has the ability to instantly kill enemies and the mage intends to use it to overthrow the empire.

14:44.620 --> 14:49.260
It's up to you to make sure that you find it first so it doesn't fall into the wrong

14:49.260 --> 14:51.260
hands.

14:51.260 --> 14:56.740
Basically this download is going to be the most expensive download yet coming in at $2.99

14:56.740 --> 14:59.340
for the PC users.

14:59.340 --> 15:05.980
No price yet on the Xbox Live Marketplace but it's assumed to be about the same.

15:05.980 --> 15:13.220
It's supposed to give you a massive, massive dungeon to be able to go through as well as

15:13.220 --> 15:18.180
adding 17 new magic items and a ton of new books.

15:18.180 --> 15:22.380
And also, might add though, if you do happen to find the item, you get to keep it.

15:22.380 --> 15:26.340
So it's a death to everybody!

15:26.340 --> 15:31.900
Alright, going to another very popular, this one an MMO, World of Warcraft.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.340
I don't actually have a lot of news about the actual game itself, but there is a trading

15:36.340 --> 15:39.900
card game that's coming out, they're going to do a card game, it's actually Upper Deck

15:39.900 --> 15:42.700
that's doing it, they're doing a game based on World of Warcraft.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.780
So the cool thing about doing the card game is that now since the video game has been

15:45.780 --> 15:52.180
out a little while, they can make some references in the card game from the computer game phenomenon

15:52.180 --> 15:53.180
in the community.

15:53.180 --> 16:00.120
And of course one of those things is Leroy Jenkins, and Leroy Jenkins is getting his

16:00.120 --> 16:01.580
own card.

16:01.580 --> 16:09.160
And just to further cool this off, coolify, I don't know how to say it, the Gabe of Penny

16:09.160 --> 16:11.840
Arcade did the artwork.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.440
actually I can show I know this doesn't make for very good radio but I can show

16:15.440 --> 16:19.240
you guys here in studio and I'll post this in chat a picture

16:19.240 --> 16:25.080
what the card looks like and if you look at the card you can actually see it

16:25.080 --> 16:28.000
looks like you know the warrior he's got the big sword and he's foaming at the

16:28.000 --> 16:30.960
mouth like ready to go into battle because if you know the story of Leroy

16:30.960 --> 16:38.240
Jenkins it kind of fits so that's pretty funny so that's just kind of neat to

16:38.240 --> 16:42.140
show that the whole like cyber cult culture can kind of you know get into

16:42.140 --> 16:47.240
the game there so breaking down that fourth wall all right anyway um speaking

16:47.240 --> 16:50.360
of breaking down the fourth wall we let you do that here on our program don't we

16:50.360 --> 16:55.640
dark Sakura in such an amazingly fantastic way yes we love being

16:55.640 --> 16:58.600
interactive and one of the ways we get you guys to participate in our program

16:58.600 --> 17:02.640
is we welcome your emails and you can email us on just about anything mailbag

17:02.640 --> 17:06.520
at orange lounge radio comm is the place to send those emails and once a week

17:06.520 --> 17:12.880
Jamie puts on her hazmat suit and dives in the mailbag and pulls out some of her favorites that hopefully do not have anthrax in

17:12.880 --> 17:13.880
them

17:13.880 --> 17:16.560
Let's hope not this time. I don't need any more disease

17:20.900 --> 17:27.640
All right who emailed us this week first one is Mac man from DreamStation CC. I know what's coming. Yeah

17:29.280 --> 17:34.640
Apple runs Microsoft on their computers. We all have Microsoft programs on our Macs even your goddamn games. Oh

17:34.640 --> 17:41.640
Oh, and for only print media thing, iLife, iMovie, iDVD, iTunes, GarageBand, and iPhoto,

17:41.640 --> 17:44.200
where is your god now?

17:44.200 --> 17:48.120
The sign by MacMan, I who have superb taste in computers, unlike Loki, he the one.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.960
Okay, so they have programs to do the same things that PCs do, but they're not better

17:51.960 --> 17:52.960
than PCs.

17:52.960 --> 17:53.960
Can't we all just get along?

17:53.960 --> 17:58.360
I mean seriously, this fucking debate's been going on for like six months.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.360
It's done.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.360
Hey!

18:00.360 --> 18:01.360
It's alright.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.360
It's okay.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.400
I understand, okay, maybe Macs don't have as many games.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.600
it doesn't matter Mac users don't like games so that's that's fine

18:07.600 --> 18:10.720
I'm getting a Mac and I like games

18:10.720 --> 18:14.160
but the magazine said

18:14.160 --> 18:17.560
buy and use whatever makes you happy

18:17.560 --> 18:21.240
there you go it's your money, spend it on whatever you want

18:21.240 --> 18:25.640
and I bought an iBook and I love it and Loki you can just

18:25.640 --> 18:28.200
if you don't like that you can kiss my butt

18:28.200 --> 18:31.720
I want a Macbook with a docking station and a new monitor instead of an iMac

18:31.720 --> 18:32.720
And there's better ones coming out.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
But anyway, let's...

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
Macbook is hot.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
I know.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
Let's keep it moving.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.720
Okay.

18:37.720 --> 18:38.720
Um, got a message from David.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.760
Um, I found this thing on Google Video by accident.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.560
It's a video of a group of people who put together a play of the first level of the

18:45.560 --> 18:46.680
original Mario Brothers.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.780
The music was a little off-timing at some parts, but I thought it was pretty funny.

18:50.780 --> 18:54.640
It'd also be pretty awesome if you guys could do a Flash website for the PSP.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.400
I'm working on it.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.320
I think the problem with Flash on the PSP right now is it's slow.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.320
It's only Flash 2.0.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.480
Yeah, it's slow.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.480
Which I don't really know... I started working with Flash 8, so...

19:05.480 --> 19:09.480
Urge Sony to get their Flash a little better, and then we'll look into it.

19:09.480 --> 19:14.480
I planned on playing with it, but honestly I don't know too much about the older versions of Flash to make it work right now.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.480
We'll have to do a Wii website when it comes out, because they have Opera in it.

19:17.480 --> 19:22.480
It supports Opera 9, which is the newest Opera browser right now.

19:22.480 --> 19:27.480
Make sure you'll get E3 on Wii!

19:27.480 --> 19:34.480
We'll see. Yeah, E3 and PSP, I don't know if I'll want to do that next year. We'll see, we'll see.

19:34.480 --> 19:40.480
Um, I also got one from Roble. It says, cue the 8-bit sound effects.

19:40.480 --> 19:45.480
He linked me a story that's talking about, and this is on Wired News.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.480
Strap up and jump like Mario.

19:48.480 --> 19:54.800
The Nintendo amusement park is by the same group of New York University students who did

19:55.980 --> 20:01.160
The pack Manhattan they were well actually is in the the same big games class

20:02.280 --> 20:07.720
The pack Manhattan was a recreation of pac-man using the streets of New York with like Central Park being in the ghost area

20:09.260 --> 20:16.620
But now they're doing an amusement park where you strap yourselves in and basically you jump through a recreation of the first level Super Mario Brothers

20:16.620 --> 20:23.780
brothers with hooks and everything is because Mario can jump four times the normal you know

20:23.780 --> 20:28.280
height of a person you get to jump four times the normal height and you get to stomp on

20:28.280 --> 20:34.080
things and run over them but the article is on wirednews.com I'll link it in the chat

20:34.080 --> 20:39.120
room anyone else is going to have to hunt it down but it's pretty cool it looks like

20:39.120 --> 20:45.200
it's fun actually the author here said that the game just a quote here the game is a lot

20:45.200 --> 20:48.760
fun and a serious workout while I wasn't in physical pain it felt like I had run

20:48.760 --> 20:52.480
a couple of miles so it actually looks like it's pretty good they're talking

20:52.480 --> 20:57.080
about how to basically do video game physics in real life and I thought it

20:57.080 --> 21:02.120
was a pretty cool application it's a little silly but whatever well no I

21:02.120 --> 21:06.060
think we can all get a little silly some I think it's a pretty fun idea and like

21:06.060 --> 21:10.680
the thing that they said was gonna be at e3 next year which wasn't quite as cool

21:10.680 --> 21:17.900
so um to the next email I got one another one from actually no that's the

21:17.900 --> 21:30.140
same one got one from spoon as opposed to fork it's three O's okay so hi I've

21:30.140 --> 21:32.940
been listening to your podcast for about four months and it's good stuff good to

21:32.940 --> 21:36.460
hear the different takes and the fact one of you he shall remain unnamed

21:36.460 --> 21:38.460
hates Max so much.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.460
He's supposed to be

21:40.460 --> 21:42.460
unnamed. I named him.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.460
Max and Nintendo

21:44.460 --> 21:46.460
go hand in hand, build

21:46.460 --> 21:48.460
a machine that can do what it's set out

21:48.460 --> 21:50.460
for correctly. Nintendo equals gameplay.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.460
Max equals work.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.460
I wanted to share with you another

21:54.460 --> 21:56.460
podcast. Loki just bites your tongue.

21:56.460 --> 21:58.460
He actually just linked us to another

21:58.460 --> 22:00.460
podcast that talks about DDR. It's called

22:00.460 --> 22:02.460
AskANinja.com. Oh, I've

22:02.460 --> 22:04.460
heard of Ask A Ninja. They're really popular.

22:04.460 --> 22:09.980
It's actually I think they're a video cast actually so they are and it's awesome is that I didn't see the DDR episode

22:09.980 --> 22:15.180
Oh, I haven't seen that either, but I I don't know. I always said that if we ever like, you know

22:15.860 --> 22:21.180
There was ever a new video game channel that they would have to put them in as like a segment

22:22.380 --> 22:26.860
How much does it cost to start a TV channel? We should start one. Somebody would give us a loan, right?

22:26.860 --> 22:27.860
Um, no, all right

22:27.860 --> 22:31.560
I'll be you can sell ads or something if you don't want to be on it

22:31.560 --> 22:33.560
I'll be Ninja Sakura.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.560
Ask a Ninja, there you go. Ask a female Ninja.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.560
Ask a Kunoichi.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.560
Alright, anyway.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.560
So we got one on our MySpace from Sergo.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.560
I guess that's pronounced.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.560
Hello there OrangeLunchRadio, how are you doing on this fine Friday afternoon?

22:45.560 --> 22:47.560
Huh, two days late.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.560
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

22:49.560 --> 22:54.560
I sent you this message to ask if you three would honor me on your input on Luminesce Mobile.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.560
I have the game and I absolutely am in love with it.

22:57.560 --> 23:01.000
many fans out there do not even

23:01.000 --> 23:03.240
i guess no of this game, he missed the word no

23:03.240 --> 23:04.680
of this game's existence

23:04.680 --> 23:08.680
which makes me sad this is also a chance for many out there who do not own a PSP

23:08.680 --> 23:11.960
to finally experience the genius of this game

23:11.960 --> 23:14.600
thank you for taking the time to read this and keep kicking ass

23:14.600 --> 23:17.600
those of you that listen to the show know i am not a big fan of mobile gaming

23:17.600 --> 23:20.440
but i am a huge fan of luminous i'll check it out i don't know if my carrier

23:20.440 --> 23:22.160
offers it though i have sprint

23:22.160 --> 23:25.260
who's kinda like the black sheep of the cell phone carrier so i don't even know if they

23:25.260 --> 23:28.140
have luminous but I'll check it out if it's out there. I didn't even know my game can

23:28.140 --> 23:32.460
play phones or play it and play games. Your phone can play games? Yeah there's a little

23:32.460 --> 23:38.220
dyslexic there. I don't know if my phone can, I imagine it can but I haven't tried because

23:38.220 --> 23:40.500
you know god knows how expensive that would be to download it. I'll check your ear and

23:40.500 --> 23:44.740
x-ray cause I'm serious. I saw a review on it and the guy that reviewed it said he liked

23:44.740 --> 23:48.660
it and that it, I mean it looked very similar. The only thing they didn't like is that the

23:48.660 --> 23:55.040
music's not like mp3 it's no bleep bleep can't be yeah yeah it's also it's MIDI

23:55.040 --> 24:01.720
and yeah it's not very midi-tastic alrighty I got one more email actually I

24:01.720 --> 24:06.000
got this to my own box jamie at orange house radio calm okay I'm just gonna

24:06.000 --> 24:12.560
paraphrase this a little bit but um it's a from a guy named Chris over who is a

24:12.560 --> 24:16.760
contributor to weebl stuff calm who was our website of the week last week as I

24:16.760 --> 24:18.760
I was going to say, that was two weeks ago, right?

24:18.760 --> 24:19.760
Two weeks ago, yeah.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.760
That's your website of the week, yeah.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.760
Yep.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.760
Wow, so somebody heard it.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.760
Apparently, he listens to our podcast, is a big fan.

24:25.760 --> 24:30.920
In fact, he says on here that it seems none of the other guys on the staff listens to

24:30.920 --> 24:34.480
OLR to their great detriment, of course, I thought I should say a big thanks for giving

24:34.480 --> 24:35.480
us a plug.

24:35.480 --> 24:38.840
I've been a fan of OLR for a long time now, and I've got to say you guys are consistently

24:38.840 --> 24:40.880
among the best independent gaming podcasts.

24:40.880 --> 24:45.320
I appreciate that you bothered to mention UK, European games news and release dates.

24:45.320 --> 24:49.320
I sometimes suspect you guys are the only American games media outlet who are even aware

24:49.320 --> 24:53.280
of this little continent's existence.

24:53.280 --> 24:58.800
I had replied back though, I'm actually not reading my own email, but basically I don't

24:58.800 --> 25:06.520
think that with a lot of the content now coming out of the US and a bit out of Japan, at least

25:06.520 --> 25:12.280
for the more niche market, I really think that the rest of the world sort of gets overlooked.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
Gamers are everywhere.

25:13.280 --> 25:19.840
We got our person from Serbia who e-mailed us. I thought it was great.

25:19.840 --> 25:20.240
Right.

25:20.240 --> 25:26.560
You know, I want to make sure that because we have listeners everywhere that, you know,

25:26.560 --> 25:30.800
it's not just United States. It's everywhere. We have listeners in Canada. We have listeners

25:30.800 --> 25:33.520
in Japan. We have listeners in China. I found that out.

25:33.520 --> 25:33.920
Wow. Cool.

25:33.920 --> 25:43.400

25:54.600 --> 25:58.160
I know one of our listeners started a Frapper map a while back, we want to see where you

25:58.160 --> 26:04.040

26:04.040 --> 26:07.960
Orange Lounge and put a pin on the map so we can see where our listeners are cause that's

26:07.960 --> 26:10.500
kind of cool like it's just kind of neat knowing where all you guys are.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.500
I would really like.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.320
Even if you're in the US cause it maps that too.

26:13.320 --> 26:19.800
I would really like though for our listeners to I'd like to have a thread on our forums

26:19.800 --> 26:24.100
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com go to the forums link on the left side of the page.

26:24.100 --> 26:27.140
Let us know where you're from let us know where you're listening from you know it'd

26:27.140 --> 26:30.660
It'd be really cool just to put, you know, names.

26:30.660 --> 26:34.740
You know, we don't want to think of, you know, just statistics, you know.

26:34.740 --> 26:39.360
Because all we see are numbers when we look at our stat pages, we want to know who you

26:39.360 --> 26:42.380
are, you know, why you listen to us, you know.

26:42.380 --> 26:44.500
I love hearing from our listeners everywhere.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.960
I think it's fantastic.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.660
All right.

26:47.660 --> 26:48.660
You say that was last one?

26:48.660 --> 26:49.620
That was last one.

26:49.620 --> 26:52.420
I saved the last one for last.

26:52.420 --> 26:53.420
All right.

26:53.420 --> 26:54.660
That's the way to do it.

26:54.660 --> 26:55.660
All right.

26:55.660 --> 27:01.500
You can ask us whatever, and as long as it's clean, we'll answer it during the show.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.020
Thanks a lot, those of you who email us.

27:03.020 --> 27:05.020
And if it's dirty, I'll save it.

27:05.020 --> 27:07.100
Alright, she'll bookmark it.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.460
Loki, back into some news, some more Sony antics.

27:10.460 --> 27:18.260
I swear to God, in the last few days, if this guy David Reeves says anything, it's always

27:18.260 --> 27:20.500
something retarded and crazy.

27:20.500 --> 27:27.500
This one though, I'm not hating on Sony, but he's the one that's saying it. Basically,

27:28.600 --> 27:35.480
his quote is this. Market share? Not that important. Who needs market share? Consoles

27:35.480 --> 27:39.480
don't need market share. Anyways, the name of the game is not market share. It's how

27:39.480 --> 27:46.000
fast we can grow the industry. Our ambition is to grow 15% a year on hardware and software

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
if we can, we want to try and double digital entertainment in the next 5-6 years whether

27:52.000 --> 28:01.000
we have 40-50 or 60% of the market share that's not that important. Well, here's a little

28:01.000 --> 28:05.720
thing to kind of be scared about, what he said here. They want to double the digital

28:05.720 --> 28:10.040
entertainment world. They didn't say game world, they said digital entertainment. So

28:10.040 --> 28:14.820
what do you think the focus of the PS3 is going to be? It's sure as hell not games,

28:14.820 --> 28:17.100
It's that stupid Blu-ray drive.

28:17.100 --> 28:22.580
They want to push the next gen thing because, you know what, imagine if you will, they're

28:22.580 --> 28:28.660
the ones that come up with the technology for Blu-ray, they want, or like DVDs, if they

28:28.660 --> 28:34.380
had been the pioneers of DVDs and stuff, they want to make all the money they can off their

28:34.380 --> 28:36.780
stupid format.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.360
So I don't know.

28:38.360 --> 28:44.540
I think it's kind of scary that he's saying that, but in the same respect, I think that

28:44.540 --> 28:48.620
40, 50, and 60 percent of the market share is a bit ambitious seeing as your console

28:48.620 --> 28:51.820
costs $600.

28:51.820 --> 28:56.700
Let's try to concentrate on getting some market share before you concentrate on getting more

28:56.700 --> 29:01.860
than Xbox or Nintendo.

29:01.860 --> 29:02.860
I don't know.

29:02.860 --> 29:05.280
I find the whole story just a little odd.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.060
It's just an odd thing to say.

29:07.060 --> 29:08.500
Well, this is the same guy.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.580
He was saying that, you know, who cares?

29:10.580 --> 29:15.500
gamers will just have to pay more for their system because you'll buy whatever it is.

29:15.500 --> 29:19.460
Even if the system didn't come out with games, you'll buy it because it's Sony.

29:19.460 --> 29:22.260
This is the same jackass that said that.

29:22.260 --> 29:26.340
What they need to do is shut him up because he's seeing really stupid stuff.

29:26.340 --> 29:32.100
Moving on to more Sony related news, there's a new controller coming out for the PlayStation

29:32.100 --> 29:33.420
2 and PC.

29:33.420 --> 29:34.540
It's a tilt controller.

29:34.540 --> 29:40.680
It's the E-Dimensional G-Pad Pro Gyroscopic Game Pad, and it has tilt-sensing technology,

29:40.680 --> 29:42.520
and it's the same thing that the PlayStation 3 has.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.840
It's coming out for the PC and the PlayStation 2.

29:46.840 --> 29:51.180
By the way, though, it also has rumble, but didn't Sony say...

29:51.180 --> 29:54.520
Now, Sony's not putting this out, but didn't Sony say that they can't do rumble in the

29:54.520 --> 29:57.840
tilt thing because it'll mess it up?

29:57.840 --> 30:03.480
Apparently not true, according to the folks behind the G-Pad Gyroscopic Game Pad, so obviously

30:03.480 --> 30:12.260
this is just a lawsuit related issue here so very interesting. Of course I don't know

30:12.260 --> 30:16.720
what the point is for this coming out. PC I could see but PlayStation 2 games don't

30:16.720 --> 30:20.720
really support it so you'd have to kind of use the feature in other games. I don't know

30:20.720 --> 30:23.960
you'd have to you know add the feature on to other games. It just doesn't make sense

30:23.960 --> 30:29.640
really. I think it might have a use on the PC where it can be easily thrown into flight

30:29.640 --> 30:34.040
simulators and types of genres that are more popular on the PC, but I don't know so much

30:34.040 --> 30:38.840
about PS2, that's kind of weird.

30:38.840 --> 30:43.040
DarkSakura, we had a letter in the mailbag about a mobile game, you have some news that

30:43.040 --> 30:44.520
kind of affects another one?

30:44.520 --> 30:46.040
I sure do.

30:46.040 --> 30:52.900
Dirge of Cerberus for mobile is actually called Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode, which is one

30:52.900 --> 30:58.280
of the Final Fantasy 7 titles coming out, and it's going to be on Amped Mobile for three

30:58.280 --> 31:03.620
months starting in the summer actually there's no word on if it's going to be

31:03.620 --> 31:11.500
out for the for the UK but it's at least we're gonna get it in the summer for a

31:11.500 --> 31:17.720
little bit I'm probably not going to play it I mean it's a mobile game I'm

31:17.720 --> 31:21.260
not really big on the mobile games the only reason I would even consider

31:21.260 --> 31:25.500
getting it is because I was a major Vincent fan girl but other than that no

31:25.500 --> 31:28.500
You know, I played through Final Fantasy 7 and I never even got Vincent.

31:28.500 --> 31:33.500
What a loss. I actually got him without using an FAQ or anything.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.500
Well, you know, in Final Fantasy, because I played Final Fantasy 7 when it first came out, you know,

31:36.500 --> 31:44.500
as you guys, I'm an older gamer, so there wasn't really the whole gamefaqs.com didn't really exist then.

31:44.500 --> 31:48.500
I found him by accident and just randomly asked the right questions.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
I also got Yuffie right the first time.

31:50.500 --> 31:54.500
Wait, no, no, no. Yuffie's the one you asked the questions to. Vincent wasn't safe.

31:54.500 --> 31:59.060
Vincent you still had to do well I never got see I never did the safe you have to

31:59.060 --> 32:03.020
answer the right thing from see I never figured out the safe but so I got both

32:03.020 --> 32:06.340
both Yuffie and Vincent that's funny Yuffie I figured out just through trial

32:06.340 --> 32:09.660
and error she showed up once you keep stealing your crap yeah and I kept

32:09.660 --> 32:13.460
running around that same forest like until she finally joined my damn party

32:13.460 --> 32:16.660
but I asked I somehow or the other managed to ask the right questions the

32:16.660 --> 32:23.500
first time hmm all right Loki has some news about the way items are packaged

32:23.500 --> 32:29.820
Yeah, I hate this. I just read it blister packaging. You gotta love it

32:29.820 --> 32:37.600
It basically if you don't know what that is, if you've ever seen anything, especially nowadays any game peripheral or anything out there

32:38.700 --> 32:44.220
It's that hard packaging that is goddamn impossible to open without killing yourself

32:44.220 --> 32:51.100
I mean, I know for a fact trying to open the Xbox 360 accessories and stuff. I that stuff's like glass

32:51.100 --> 32:56.640
It's really scary, but I'm actually it's funny because wired news did a little

32:57.300 --> 33:01.220
article here called tales from packaging hell and basically

33:02.260 --> 33:07.120
The whole thing behind the packaging is that you know, it's meant to avoid

33:08.260 --> 33:15.980
You know obviously theft but a lot of people have like really gotten hurt by this and they have some pictures actually of you know

33:15.980 --> 33:17.060
people with

33:17.060 --> 33:21.460
Major gashes on their hands and just you know people being sent to the hospital

33:22.520 --> 33:24.520
You know this one guy

33:25.780 --> 33:29.460
George from was it George looks like Monroe from Atlanta

33:30.140 --> 33:34.780
Sliced his hand open and there's a that's about an inch long gash

33:34.780 --> 33:41.020
I mean, that's some serious like cry I've damn near killed myself on that packaging. I mean, it's it's why

33:41.020 --> 33:43.300
It doesn't pop open.

33:43.300 --> 33:46.940
I mean, granted, people can't steal the stuff out of it.

33:46.940 --> 33:47.940
Okay, that's great.

33:47.940 --> 33:48.940
But you know what?

33:48.940 --> 33:51.740
Normal packaging can do the same thing.

33:51.740 --> 33:56.880
When it takes me like 10 minutes, I really, you can't use scissors, because scissors aren't

33:56.880 --> 34:00.580
sharp enough to get through this, so you have to use a knife, and you have to stab it in

34:00.580 --> 34:07.060
there, and the knife, most of the time, if it's relatively dull or if it's not as sharp

34:07.060 --> 34:10.540
as it can be, it'll slip, and it'll cut yourself the knife.

34:10.540 --> 34:16.580
Even if you manage to do get it open, the edges are really sharp and jaggedy, and it's

34:16.580 --> 34:21.900
like cutting open glass, and basically, I don't know, a lot of people go to the hospital

34:21.900 --> 34:27.380
because of this stuff, and I wouldn't doubt it, I mean, it's just, it's scary stuff.

34:27.380 --> 34:30.620
Alright, that packaging makes me angry, I don't know about you, but it makes me angry

34:30.620 --> 34:33.260
and it makes me want to rant, doesn't it make you want to rant, DarkSakura?

34:33.260 --> 34:36.460
Can't you put stuff in boxes like they used to?

34:36.460 --> 34:41.620
mean seriously cardboard boxes just as effective you know low-key get past it

34:41.620 --> 34:44.580
I'm trying to get to the next segment

34:50.860 --> 34:56.900
the FUs of the week time dark Sakura start us off my FU of the week goes

34:56.900 --> 35:04.780
toward it's a number of people who have it's actually a misconception I'm gonna

35:04.780 --> 35:09.540
put my F.U. of the week toward you know like I've said at the beginning of the

35:09.540 --> 35:13.620
last segment I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome which is why I

35:13.620 --> 35:18.740
was really sick with what I call the plague in November and December and have

35:18.740 --> 35:24.540
been you know consistently not feeling well there's people who say oh well

35:24.540 --> 35:30.540
you'll be just fine when you get back from your medical need no that's not how

35:30.540 --> 35:37.060
it works it's just it's something that a lot of people think is either an all in

35:37.060 --> 35:41.100
your head sort of thing you know or something that you can just fix with a

35:41.100 --> 35:45.860
drug or something that if you just sleep a lot you'll get over it but the whole

35:45.860 --> 35:49.980
thing about is that no matter how much sleep you get you still feel tired you

35:49.980 --> 35:54.660
feel like you haven't slept you go through phases of being really hungry

35:54.660 --> 35:57.860
and then not being hungry at all and nothing you will ever make you feel

35:57.860 --> 36:03.620
satisfied if you're in one of those phases you feel like your muscles hurt all the time

36:04.420 --> 36:08.580
and for anyone who thinks that it's just an all in your head type of thing fuck you okay

36:09.300 --> 36:13.540
you know it's it's a fully diagnosed thing it's something that they you know you have

36:13.540 --> 36:18.900
to rule out physical factors before they diagnose you with it but taking a nap doesn't help you know

36:18.900 --> 36:24.420
i've been sleeping for upwards of 10 hours a day you know while i've been on my medical leave and

36:24.420 --> 36:29.300
it still hasn't helped hardly any I get to learn how to give myself shots on

36:29.300 --> 36:34.880
Wednesday though which is not fun but yeah so for anyone who thinks that it's

36:34.880 --> 36:37.380
you know an all in your head sort of thing and that you know a little rest

36:37.380 --> 36:42.320
or some vitamins will you know help you get over it it may help but it's not the

36:42.320 --> 36:47.000
cure so stop telling me that I'll feel better when my leave is up because I

36:47.000 --> 36:48.920
don't think I will.

36:48.920 --> 37:01.920
Mokey. Couple things. First off, fuck you to Christopher for the smell that's coming from his desk, and I'm gonna guess it's from these three empty McFlurry containers which are probably rotting right now.

37:01.920 --> 37:07.920
That's a really nasty, like, rotten milk smell that's... ugh. Anyways, so fuck you to that.

37:07.920 --> 37:14.420
Fucking the stupid people that are in my apartment complex who are parking their car in the middle of the parking lot

37:14.420 --> 37:17.720
Just basically just in the middle because they're talking to a friend or something like that

37:17.720 --> 37:19.420
I fucking hate people that do that shit

37:19.420 --> 37:23.420
Get out of your goddamn car or park it if you need to talk to somebody

37:23.420 --> 37:26.420
Or you know what, do what everybody else does, talk on your damn cell phone

37:26.420 --> 37:31.920
I'm sure whatever you're telling them is not that important and you do not need to be blocking my path

37:31.920 --> 37:33.420
So, fuck you

37:33.420 --> 37:47.420
And then finally, I don't know, I'm just talking to you and being hungry, oh, and fucking needles, because every time I get poked with a needle by a doctor, I almost pass out.

37:47.420 --> 37:52.420
You know, it's not necessarily medication or something, but my body goes into shock whenever I have a needle.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.420
No tattoos for loci.

37:54.420 --> 37:56.420
So yeah, that sucks.

37:56.420 --> 38:02.420
My F.U. goes to this humongous zit that's on my face right now that won't go away no matter what I put on it

38:02.420 --> 38:05.420
Because it makes me feel really ugly and sad

38:05.420 --> 38:07.420
No matter what I put on it part

38:07.420 --> 38:12.420
Because it makes me feel ugly and sad and makes me not want to be social

38:12.420 --> 38:16.420
Because I feel... I feel ugly

38:16.420 --> 38:18.420
That it'll go away

38:18.420 --> 38:20.420
And then I'll be pretty again

38:20.420 --> 38:23.420
Alright, anyway, let's move on to another story

38:23.420 --> 38:30.420
Story, Loki, it's all you.

38:30.420 --> 38:35.020
I'm wondering if this shouldn't have been before the FUs, but anyways, higher prices

38:35.020 --> 38:41.340
for games for the Playstation 3 and the Wii are confirmed by Atari.

38:41.340 --> 38:46.260
And actually Atari is the distributor for Sega in some parts of Europe, so it's basically

38:46.260 --> 38:47.260
some of the Sega games.

38:47.260 --> 38:57.180
Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3 for example is going to cost 67.99 euros while some of

38:57.180 --> 39:05.940
the games like World Snooker Championship 2007 will be 73.99 euros.

39:05.940 --> 39:12.300
And basically on the Wii, Sonic Wildfire and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz will both be

39:12.300 --> 39:20.300
be available for 59.99 euros and it's a lot more than what we've got to pay for them.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.300
Sorry.

39:21.300 --> 39:22.300
Damn, Texas.

39:22.300 --> 39:25.300
All right.

39:25.300 --> 39:28.540
Microsoft made a pretty interesting statement this week.

39:28.540 --> 39:32.920
It was Chris Lewis who works for Microsoft was speaking about Sony's online service

39:32.920 --> 39:37.380
saying I'm flattered that they followed our clear direction.

39:37.380 --> 39:38.940
Plagiarism is a good thing.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.900
That in itself isn't such a problem.

39:40.900 --> 39:45.860
That's what the market wants, but we've known that's what the market wanted all along.

39:45.860 --> 39:49.040
So that, by the way, was in an interview with Eurogamer.

39:49.040 --> 39:53.060
So Microsoft kind of taking a swing there that PlayStation 3 is just downright copying

39:53.060 --> 39:54.060
them.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.060
Interesting.

39:55.060 --> 39:59.700
But again, you know, you kind of expect that you're going to get copied in some elements,

39:59.700 --> 40:00.700
but whatever.

40:00.700 --> 40:04.020
Loki, you have some news about Wii web browsing.

40:04.020 --> 40:05.020
Yes.

40:05.020 --> 40:09.440
Opera, of course, as everybody knows, is going to be the web browser on the Wii.

40:09.440 --> 40:15.400
And they've actually released some information of what this is going to support and some

40:15.400 --> 40:16.680
of the details on it.

40:16.680 --> 40:23.800
First off, Opera will be embedded on the Wii's Flash ROM, unlike the DS version which is

40:23.800 --> 40:28.080
actually a cart based operating system.

40:28.080 --> 40:33.800
The browser will or may take advantage of some of the gesture based navigation interaction

40:33.800 --> 40:38.260
that's available with the Wii controller, so that would be kind of interesting.

40:38.260 --> 40:43.300
And no advertisements will be included within the browser, however, you shouldn't rule out

40:43.300 --> 40:48.220
that there won't be in-game advertising delivered via Opera.

40:48.220 --> 40:49.500
But I think that's pretty interesting.

40:49.500 --> 40:54.860
Another thing that someone's bringing up about the Dreamcast browser is that they had special

40:54.860 --> 40:59.980
features for, like when you're programming web pages, you can actually make the Dreamcast

40:59.980 --> 41:01.940
VMU rumble or display things.

41:01.940 --> 41:06.380
I think that'd be really cool if they added that kind of to the Wii browser where you

41:06.380 --> 41:13.380
can make the controller rumbler special tags or something to use the Wii controller. Something

41:13.380 --> 41:18.780
to think about. That's a little weird. And it's also basically going to be compatible

41:18.780 --> 41:27.780
with Opera 9 which is the one that's out currently right now. So it is supposed to support most

41:27.780 --> 41:34.980
everything including Java so like they said in the interview here it looks like it's based

41:34.980 --> 41:41.980
on Opera 9 for devices, and it will include the latest technology, including AJAX.

41:41.980 --> 41:50.740
Hmm. Cool. Alrighty. Dark Sakura. Something we've had here for a long time, but it's coming

41:50.740 --> 41:54.380
out to Japan. This is a little backwards from what it usually is.

41:54.380 --> 42:02.580
Actually, yeah, there's going to be game rentals in Japan. It actually started on the third.

42:02.580 --> 42:13.340
Basically Koei will put out its first rent-a-net video store at the Taito Game Center in Kanagawa.

42:13.340 --> 42:20.180
Basically it's not, there's not any real rental franchises like we have here, not like Blockbuster

42:20.180 --> 42:23.800
or anything, so this is a very, very new thing there.

42:23.800 --> 42:30.760
New games will basically rent for 2,800 yen, which is 2,450 over here for five days.

42:30.760 --> 42:37.380
then you bring them back $24 that's expensive everything is more expensive in

42:37.380 --> 42:42.940
Japan all right I just want to say real quick I had to correct something I said

42:42.940 --> 42:46.340
earlier funny Dale actually in chat room corrected me on something I said about

42:46.340 --> 42:51.220
game facts wasn't around when Final Fantasy 7 it actually started in 1995 so

42:51.220 --> 42:53.540
they actually were around it's just not a lot of people knew about them including

42:53.540 --> 42:57.460
me but certainly they weren't you know the site they are now then it's been a

42:57.460 --> 43:02.600
long time. I actually use them for Super Nintendo stuff back in the day. That's crazy. I used

43:02.600 --> 43:06.600
eBay when they first came out, but back when they were, well not back when they were PEZ

43:06.600 --> 43:10.100
dispensers, but just after that, before they got all commercialized, I bought Super Metroid

43:10.100 --> 43:17.340
on eBay like in 97. So, anyway, websites were different back then, because browsers weren't

43:17.340 --> 43:21.120
the same. Anyway, one more story here guys, and we're going to go to our Skype line over

43:21.120 --> 43:24.680
at orangelaunchradio.com, click on and interact with us, Loki, what's up?

43:24.680 --> 43:33.680
Yes, a British, what was it, the SCI, some British publication was saying that they're

43:33.680 --> 43:39.920
going to be extending Eidos's licenses for Hitman and Tomb Raider to the gambling franchises,

43:39.920 --> 43:46.600
including online and, I don't know, you're basically going to see some video slot machines

43:46.600 --> 43:55.200
based on both Lara Croft and Agent 47 and yeah I guess that's interesting. You should

43:55.200 --> 43:58.840
know though that they're still going to steal your money just as well as all the other video

43:58.840 --> 44:08.640
slot machines out there so yeah. Unfortunately no boobies in the slot machines either. Sorry.

44:08.640 --> 44:14.240
Alright. I don't know I can't get too excited about slot machines because I personally hate

44:14.240 --> 44:18.360
those video slot machines, I think that they're a big waste of money, especially the nickel

44:18.360 --> 44:19.360
ones.

44:19.360 --> 44:25.000
It's just, you have to put more nickels in, that's all, you know, instead of quarters.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.280
You know, more of the same, whatever.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.280
Alright.

44:28.280 --> 44:32.040
We're going to go head on over to our Skype line if you guys want to call in and talk

44:32.040 --> 44:33.040
about anything.

44:33.040 --> 44:39.400
It's www.orangelogister.com, click on interact with us, or you can give us a call, 916-226-9067,

44:39.400 --> 44:42.280

44:42.280 --> 44:45.960
just so you know, that isn't a toll-free number. You may have to ask your parents'

44:45.960 --> 44:48.400
permission or whoever owns the phone line before you call.

44:48.400 --> 44:51.440
And we're getting a phone call right now, let's go to our first call tonight. Hello,

44:51.440 --> 44:53.160
you're on Orange Launch Radio.

44:53.160 --> 44:57.400
Hello. Hi, who's this? This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.760
Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64. You're a little quiet, but what's on your mind?

45:00.760 --> 45:06.000
Oh, well, it's probably because I'm actually using my regular phone. I don't know, my mic jack died on my laptop.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.760
That's weird. Well, get out your thoughts anyway. Okay, anyway,

45:09.760 --> 45:15.760
Okay, I have an announcement to make. Let me see if I can load up my test. Okay, here we go.

45:15.760 --> 45:23.760
From Game 7 to 10, I'm going to be in New York City. Since we're getting an art award for this archery season,

45:23.760 --> 45:33.760
I'll be at the Nintendo World Store on Friday at 11 AM. So, if you're looking for something out there,

45:33.760 --> 45:39.360
me if you want. You know what's with me? I'll be wearing that pancake bling. I'll be wearing

45:39.360 --> 45:47.480
a shirt with that. I have a topic here on the forum. More details. I'll get you a small

45:47.480 --> 46:00.160
link for it. xrl.us slash nz5. That's it. And I can also put it in chat if you want.

46:00.160 --> 46:04.360
I think I heard about half of that because of the connection we have here.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.360
Let me get this right.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.580
You said you're going to be at the Nintendo store on Friday and you want to meet other

46:08.580 --> 46:10.280
listeners of the show or something?

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
Sure.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.280

46:12.280 --> 46:13.280
At 11 a.m.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.380
And what are you going to be wearing?

46:15.380 --> 46:18.960
I'm going to be wearing a shirt with the pancake bunny on.

46:18.960 --> 46:19.960
Oh, Oolong.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.960
Oh, Oolong the pancake bunny.

46:21.960 --> 46:22.960
Okay, yeah.

46:22.960 --> 46:23.960
Poor dead bunny.

46:23.960 --> 46:24.960
Dude, that guy rocks.

46:24.960 --> 46:31.520
Then just in case if somebody missed it, it's xrl.us slash mz5k.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.320
All right.

46:33.320 --> 46:37.900
I'm glad you could use this program to help make yourself more friends in person.

46:37.900 --> 46:38.900
Have fun at the store.

46:38.900 --> 46:39.900

Thank you.

46:41.900 --> 46:42.900
All right.

46:42.900 --> 46:43.900
I'm letting you go now because your connection sucks.

46:43.900 --> 46:44.900
All right.

46:44.900 --> 46:45.900
All right.

46:45.900 --> 46:46.900
Take care, buddy.

46:46.900 --> 46:47.900
See you.

46:47.900 --> 46:48.900
All right.

46:48.900 --> 46:50.020
So much for that.

46:50.020 --> 46:51.300
I want to go meet listeners.

46:51.300 --> 46:52.300
Oh, well.

46:52.300 --> 46:53.820
We did that last week.

46:53.820 --> 46:54.820
Yeah, we did.

46:54.820 --> 46:57.140

47:08.020 --> 47:09.060
Let's go to another call.

47:09.060 --> 47:11.300
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

47:11.300 --> 47:13.660
Good evening, all arts, DMN, how are ya?

47:13.660 --> 47:15.860
Good, oh, your connection's much better than the last guy.

47:15.860 --> 47:17.420
What's on your mind, DMN?

47:17.420 --> 47:19.320
Well, as you announced earlier,

47:19.320 --> 47:22.900
I had that little contest of exclusive Zelda questions.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.900
That's right! Did you get a winner?

47:24.900 --> 47:26.900
I did. T23M is the winner.

47:26.900 --> 47:28.900
Uh-huh. Oh!

47:28.900 --> 47:30.900
That's 23 Vegas.

47:30.900 --> 47:32.900
He should be disqualified, because he comes on the show once.

47:32.900 --> 47:34.900
No, I'm kidding. Let him have it.

47:36.900 --> 47:38.900
He's a local.

47:38.900 --> 47:42.900
But yeah, going back to jumping release dates.

47:42.900 --> 47:51.900
I've heard that Nintendo's practice is generally they give those offending retailers shipments late or very low shipments later on.

47:51.900 --> 47:57.580
later on. So I don't... Beg your pardon? Do you think Nintendo is going to give a company

47:57.580 --> 48:05.580
like Target a big spanking? I think so, because I remember Microsoft released Project Gotham

48:05.580 --> 48:11.700
2, I believe it was, a couple of days early, and they got beat down for it. I recall that

48:11.700 --> 48:16.460
they got Halo 2, a very low shipment of Halo 2, I think a half shipment of Halo 2 in each

48:16.460 --> 48:26.460
store um wow so i think i think uh target's going to be in big trouble for uh releasing the ds light

48:26.460 --> 48:32.540
early but on the other side hey you know we can get some ds lights they're already out there and

48:32.540 --> 48:37.500
word of mouth i'm sure travels and it kind of created a sudden surge of interest a little bit

48:37.500 --> 48:41.580
on the blogs while people frantically hunted these down so i don't think the news is all bad for

48:41.580 --> 48:46.460
for Nintendo here. Oh no, not at all. I can actually tell you first hand, the DS Lite

48:46.460 --> 48:52.540
is awesome. Somebody brought one to the E3 Outpost that they had imported. I want to

48:52.540 --> 48:59.500
say the guy that we invited who called in. That was SilentWind. That's right, he had

48:59.500 --> 49:03.900
one. I think he brought it to show us. Yeah. They also had them on the demo's E3. I'm looking

49:03.900 --> 49:11.420
at mine right now, it looks pretty nice. Rub it in. Alright, now did you go to a target

49:11.420 --> 49:14.240
to get it or do you get it from a special like you were for Nintendo your

49:14.240 --> 49:18.280
special thing I actually got mine from an import store

49:18.280 --> 49:24.620
Nintendo just got theirs in gotcha okay all right well anything else you want to

49:24.620 --> 49:28.120
share with our listeners uh nope take care guys thanks everybody for

49:28.120 --> 49:31.080

49:50.260 --> 49:54.300

or head on over to your telephone and dial 916 226 9067 as long as you're

50:04.860 --> 50:07.980
the one that's paying the bills and Nintendo maniac 64 is yelling at me in

50:07.980 --> 50:10.620
chat because I was dissing his call a little bit there saying he was using the

50:10.620 --> 50:15.820
phone so unfortunately if your phone is kind of quiet usually it's gonna come

50:15.820 --> 50:19.740
across quiet here I know cell phones sometimes have a lot of problems but it

50:19.740 --> 50:24.800
just all depends on the connection you know how it goes sometimes so just wait

50:24.800 --> 50:27.700
and see here if we get any more phone calls if not we'll just go ahead and

50:27.700 --> 50:31.000
wrap things up for tonight does anybody have any last-minute stories they want

50:31.000 --> 50:34.780
to share Loki or dark soccer any last-minute stories for our listeners I

50:34.780 --> 50:39.340
I was just going to talk really quickly about Forza 2, because there are some updates on

50:39.340 --> 50:45.260
IGN about it, including that it's going to be built using a completely new 360 engine.

50:45.260 --> 50:50.060
This isn't Forza 1 in HD, nice little slap at Sony there.

50:50.060 --> 50:54.780
Forza 2 is going to run at 60 frames per second with reflection mapping on all the cars running

50:54.780 --> 50:56.260
at 60 frames per second as well.

50:56.260 --> 51:02.300
It's going to support the new wireless racing wheel, feature 60 tracks, 18 environments,

51:02.300 --> 51:09.740
real-world license circuits and will feature over 300 cars and from more than

51:09.740 --> 51:15.620
50 of the world's leading manufacturers including Ferrari, Porsche, Nissan, VW, GM

51:15.620 --> 51:21.380
and Lamborghini to name a few. Forza will allow people to customize

51:21.380 --> 51:27.860
their cars to a new degree of stylization including alternative

51:27.860 --> 51:34.060
engines, suspension kits, bolt-on superchargers, brakes, rims, racing slicks,

51:34.060 --> 51:40.320
and work on advanced suspension settings, tire pressure, and gear ratios. So it

51:40.320 --> 51:45.500
sounds like Gran Turismo to the extreme, seriously. Anybody else have any other

51:45.500 --> 51:49.220
last-minute stories? All right, well our chat room is feeling a little shy

51:49.220 --> 51:51.940
tonight because we're not getting any of their calls and neither anybody else

51:51.940 --> 51:54.800
listening out there, so. I was gonna mention one more thing here, so I'm

51:54.800 --> 52:00.240
mention this in the chatroom and I apologize for not knowing who it was or not remembering.

52:00.240 --> 52:05.760
HappyHardcore.com mentioned that they're going to have a couple songs in the upcoming DDR

52:05.760 --> 52:08.440
Universe and UltraMix 4.

52:08.440 --> 52:15.800
Including UltraMix 4 is going to be Fracas featuring Lisa Abbott, Desire the Comet remix,

52:15.800 --> 52:24.520
and also on Universe, the Acolyte with Treble, Bass, and Attitude, which is going to be a

52:24.520 --> 52:29.020
Eurotrance song and triple bass and attitude is actually the one that's on

52:29.020 --> 52:38.940

52:43.180 --> 52:47.420

52:54.220 --> 52:56.820
Nah, I just came back from Europe yesterday.

52:56.820 --> 52:58.220
Ooh, how are things over in Europe?

52:58.220 --> 52:59.920
Expensive.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.220
Don't tell me you flew over there just to play Supernova.

53:02.220 --> 53:06.620
Nah, I'd barely seen Supernova where I was at in Spain.

53:06.620 --> 53:09.620
And through parts of Paris and Milan and Rome.

53:09.620 --> 53:12.220
That's right, wait, you're of Spanish descent, right?

53:12.220 --> 53:16.020
I'm a Peruvian, actually, but we do have family in Spain.

53:16.020 --> 53:16.620
My bad.

53:16.620 --> 53:21.020
I thought I remember in a previous episode you saying something about that, but

53:21.020 --> 53:23.120
whoa, what is wrong with your connection? Stop.

53:23.120 --> 53:27.000
You got some weird thing going on there with your mic

53:27.000 --> 53:30.880
Fix it. What's on your mind?

53:30.880 --> 53:35.520
Now for some reason you said that Supernova was supposed to come out

53:35.520 --> 53:38.920
last mid-May which was a couple weeks before

53:38.920 --> 53:42.840
you know before I actually made the trip out. Yep. Came back nothing

53:42.840 --> 53:47.040
you know it doesn't seem to me that nothing has appeared

53:47.040 --> 53:50.160
by now you know if it did come out like

53:50.160 --> 53:54.160
like Konami said they would. I would see

53:54.160 --> 53:57.640
about you know about all the songs

53:57.640 --> 54:01.400
from each part of the country. Okay here it is here it is

54:01.400 --> 54:04.520
it probably got pushed back is anyone really surprised?

54:04.520 --> 54:08.360
Games get pushed back all the time. So

54:08.360 --> 54:13.040
wouldn't it be prudent to just make that correction? To just say that you know it

54:13.040 --> 54:15.040
might have been released last May or

54:15.040 --> 54:19.360
because of what I'm hearing. With arcade games it's usually not the same thing as

54:19.360 --> 54:23.320
console because you are not the one that purchases an arcade game the arcade

54:23.320 --> 54:24.080
owners do

54:24.080 --> 54:27.720
so to come on the fans I don't know I just it's a little different when we're

54:27.720 --> 54:30.040
talking about console games I think versus

54:30.040 --> 54:33.200
arcade games yeah I guess

54:33.200 --> 54:36.440
yeah yeah just just to keep that in mind

54:36.440 --> 54:41.360
I understand where you come from. Somebody in Sephiroth1215 is yelling out it's mid June now

54:41.360 --> 54:44.840
so I guess we'll see yeah that's what it was saying

54:44.840 --> 54:49.160
and let me see so far

54:49.160 --> 54:53.520
Did I miss anything in the past two weeks? Any gaming news?

54:53.520 --> 54:58.780
We took some video of the Ultramix stuff and universe stuff at E3 and it's on

54:58.780 --> 55:00.560
YouTube if you search for OLR

55:00.560 --> 55:04.760
and I don't know. Go listen to our old podcast!

55:04.760 --> 55:08.280
Check it out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you'll get caught up on all your gaming news.

55:08.280 --> 55:13.520
Yeah. Would you like that plug? Yeah. One more thing, stuff in Europe is

55:13.520 --> 55:17.040
hella expensive. Even DDR games

55:17.040 --> 55:20.600
But you know heroes about a buck third. Oh

55:22.020 --> 55:25.320
All right, Zach. Oh, I'm hanging up on you. You're breaking up. I'm sorry to hear it was so expensive

55:25.840 --> 55:28.640
All right, we had fun though. You lucky bastard least you get to travel

55:29.280 --> 55:31.280
Yeah, all righty

55:32.040 --> 55:36.960
He said everything's more expensive over there is kind of what I picked up from that. I forgot we have a voicemail

55:36.960 --> 55:40.400
I have to play to us. We'll play that in a moment. But let's do some more calls here real quick

55:40.400 --> 55:42.280
Micaiah, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

55:42.280 --> 55:43.600
Hey, what's up, man?

55:43.600 --> 55:44.600
This is Bandit.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.600
Hello, Bandit.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.600
What's on your mind?

55:46.600 --> 55:49.800
Hey, that last guy that was just talking about the Supernova?

55:49.800 --> 55:50.800
Yep.

55:50.800 --> 55:55.520
Well, I called Bets and Air Prizes last week, and they actually told me it's shipping the

55:55.520 --> 55:58.160
last two weeks of June.

55:58.160 --> 55:59.800
You went right to the horse's mouth.

55:59.800 --> 56:05.760
Yeah, I actually called the number that was on Konami's website, and they forwarded me

56:05.760 --> 56:11.800
to a guy who handles the machines in the Pittsburgh area.

56:11.800 --> 56:15.400
Now do you work for an arcade or are you just a crazed fan?

56:15.400 --> 56:19.720
No, maybe a little bit, but you know what I used to?

56:19.720 --> 56:20.720
A hardcore fan.

56:20.720 --> 56:29.040
I got rid of the local arcade and he went ahead and gave me that information.

56:29.040 --> 56:31.240
Well cool, I guess it's good to know.

56:31.240 --> 56:33.560
So hey, it'll be out just in time for my birthday.

56:33.560 --> 56:34.560
Oh yeah, definitely.

56:34.560 --> 56:42.560
Alright. Speaking of which chat room, what are you getting me for my birthday? It's June 26th, and I do accept cash. I'll take chocolate too. Jamie's shaking my hand.

56:42.560 --> 56:43.560
Give me your present now.

56:43.560 --> 56:47.560
Oh, there you go. Thanks. I appreciate that. Alright. Anything else on your mind, Bandit?

56:47.560 --> 56:49.560
Uh, no. That's all for now, man.

56:49.560 --> 56:52.560
Alright. I appreciate the small correction there. I like that you went to the horse's mouth.

56:52.560 --> 56:53.560
Oh, yeah. Of course.

56:53.560 --> 56:55.560
Alright. Have a good one, buddy.

56:55.560 --> 56:56.560
Alright. You too.

56:56.560 --> 56:57.560
Bye.

56:57.560 --> 57:02.560
One more call, and then we'll do the voicemail, and then we'll wrap up the Skype line. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

57:02.560 --> 57:06.720
Who's this ice guy? It's me Ravens dolphin. Hello. Hello Ravens dolphin. What's on your mind?

57:07.520 --> 57:11.460
Well, the DS light breaking street date. Would you get one?

57:12.180 --> 57:18.880
No, what do you think about it? Um, I think it's hot but I'm I don't like iPod white. Oh

57:19.700 --> 57:22.040
You don't like the color. Yeah, I hate it

57:22.040 --> 57:27.340
You know somebody was telling me today about a little trick or something and you know, this is a questionable

57:27.340 --> 57:33.380
ethics, so do what you want with this advice, but as I understand, what you could do is

57:33.380 --> 57:38.400
you go to a store, I think it was EB Games, and you buy your DS Lite and buy the replacement

57:38.400 --> 57:45.180
plan with it, so it's only like 15 bucks or whatever, and then when a new color comes

57:45.180 --> 57:50.460
out that you want, run over your DS Lite with your car and then take it into EB Games and

57:50.460 --> 57:54.420
say it broke, I want a new one, and voila, you get your new one a new color.

57:54.420 --> 57:59.340
Hey, that's what I did with my PSP and that's what I'm probably going to do with this.

57:59.340 --> 58:07.940
You guys, I shouldn't be endorsing such scamming, but I don't know, I kind of get irritated

58:07.940 --> 58:11.580
that I always get asked no matter what store I go into about those damn replacement plans,

58:11.580 --> 58:12.580
so maybe they'll get rid of them.

58:12.580 --> 58:13.580
One more thing.

58:13.580 --> 58:14.580
What?

58:14.580 --> 58:16.860
All right, you remember you were talking about the Minnesota thing?

58:16.860 --> 58:17.860
Uh-huh.

58:17.860 --> 58:20.500
All right, if you're 18, it's 50 bucks.

58:20.500 --> 58:23.340
If you're 16, it's 75.

58:23.340 --> 58:27.340
Wow. That's a really big slap on the wrist.

58:27.340 --> 58:31.340
But then again, what 16-year-old has $75 that they didn't get from Mom or Dad?

58:31.340 --> 58:36.340
And also, if you're 18 years old, there's no games you can't play.

58:36.340 --> 58:40.340
That's true. But you could be buying the games for somebody else.

58:40.340 --> 58:41.340
I guess.

58:41.340 --> 58:42.340
That's weird.

58:42.340 --> 58:48.340
As far as the 16-year-old goes, if it was my 16-year-old that did that and got the $75 fine,

58:48.340 --> 58:51.860
expecting me to pay it as the parent I'd be all you better start learning how to

58:51.860 --> 58:56.580
say you like fries with that that's how you're gonna pay it off all right

58:56.580 --> 59:01.740
anything else ravens dolphin yeah have you ever landed that that plane and top

59:01.740 --> 59:07.540
gun uh-oh God back on the NES a refueling it was a pain in the ass

59:07.540 --> 59:13.260
enough I don't even remember trying to land it this is one random question of

59:13.260 --> 59:17.380
the night all right well thanks for derailing our show we appreciate it all

59:17.380 --> 59:19.740
All right, have a good one, buddy.

59:19.740 --> 59:22.700
Bye-bye.

59:22.700 --> 59:24.100
Ah, we've got crazy listeners.

59:24.100 --> 59:25.380
Not as crazy as this, though.

59:25.380 --> 59:27.740
This is another one from a Nintendo Maniac 64,

59:27.740 --> 59:29.560
left us a voicemail.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.440
It's kind of a plug for another website,

59:31.440 --> 59:33.020
but I thought this was just too funny.

59:33.020 --> 59:33.700
I had to play this.

59:33.700 --> 59:35.380
So this is something that was left on our voicemail

59:35.380 --> 59:35.880
this week.

59:35.880 --> 59:36.860
Check this out.

59:36.860 --> 59:44.020
This is the internet relay service, CA 8617,

59:44.020 --> 59:49.820
with a message from Connie Echla, Orange Lounge Radio.

59:49.820 --> 59:53.580
This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

59:53.580 --> 59:55.820
I'm using an online program that allows

59:55.820 --> 59:58.340
you to call people using the internet.

59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.540
No long distance charge.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:04.180
You type a message in and hit the GA button,

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:08.180
and your message will be read by a randomly selected talker.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.140
You can first test it out by calling yourself.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.100
you can check this out at sprintip.com.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.440
Have fun and avoid any giant enemy crabs.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.880
GA that's like for a teletypewriter

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.800
yeah basically I thought it was cool that he just got some random

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.900
you know poor older lady there to have to tell us to avoid giant enemy crabs

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.080
that was all kinds of cool

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.640
now guys don't start sending us a barrage of messages doing this okay the

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.960
first time is cool

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.920
the second and third and fourth and fifth times will be annoying so don't get

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.960
these poor people

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.660
to say all these random things I do not want any voicemails left on the line

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.120
with you

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.120
Hi, we're calling from the teletype service Ridge Racer.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.360
Okay, I will come to your house and beat you up if you do that.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.720
I'll have them call you back and yell obscenities at you.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.320
Wonder Dog Harold in our chat room says the internet relay lady was hot sounding.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:12.480
Dark Sakura just made a face.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.120
That was wrong.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.520
but funny and that's the important part it's funny in a very wrong way

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.900
uh... it's only funny until someone gets hurt and it's hilarious

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.280
speaking of hilarious

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.400
when you get it on tape it's ludicrous I have one more story for you guys

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.240
do you remember back in the day this actually has nothing to do with video

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.520
games but it does have to do with games

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.400
and uh... that does make it a very important story

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.800
do you guys remember those books when we were kids the choose your own adventure

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.300
books oh yeah

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.900
You know those were first published in 1979?

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.420
You want to know what? I actually have one from 1980.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:55.020
It's actually one of my books that got damaged I think in the hurricane.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.260
I remember going to the library and using to check out these books.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.980
Because you know they would do the

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.940
book club over the summer where you have to read 50 books.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.820
So you just read a bunch of Choose Your Own Adventure books.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.580
That's how you do the 50 books.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.180
But anyway, get this.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.420
Choose Your Own Adventure, they're coming back. This summer

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.920
eight of the original titles will return to bookstores and they're going to be

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.780
revamped with 21st century references like cell phones

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.300
that's that's the news that's all there is to say. You do this you're dead

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.700
you do this you're dead it's a whole new generation to enjoy

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.940
after reading the book 50 million times you actually find the one that you live through

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.460
you're driving down a street

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.180
