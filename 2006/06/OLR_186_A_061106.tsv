14119	19464	Tonight, June 11th, 2006, Xbox gets updates and is the luminous release around the corner.
19864	26390	Video game addicts get their own version of the Betty Ford Clinic, and a game of Solitaire comes into play during the high-profile trial.
32423	36267	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36307	39610	We are here to talk about all the news that gamers really want to know about.
40431	41752	And we're here to help you through that.
41792	42753	My name is Rob Roberts.
42773	43754	You might know me as Sky.
43794	48738	Joining me as always, say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48839	49239	Water.
50000	50480	Sandwich.
51041	53583	Actually, I think I might start referring to her as the queen of the internet.
54584	55765	I'm not the queen of the internet.
55825	56986	I'm the goddess of the internet.
57006	57547	Oh, I'm sorry.
58462	58982	That's right.
59162	59602	Bow down.
59843	60743	Watch that ego there.
60763	61043	All right.
61503	61803	What ego?
61843	62784	I'm just kidding.
62964	63864	It's only explosive.
64164	64444	All right.
65165	67545	Over there, say hello to the other queen of the internet, Loki.
68426	69026	I'm not a queen.
69466	69926	I know you're not.
70086	73488	That would be Rob, the queen of the internet.
74628	76829	Anyway, how are you doing, Loki, Tech Master Loki?
76889	77449	I'm doing okay.
77709	77949	Yeah?
78349	78529	Yeah.
79070	81811	Do you want to start off the show by issuing any apologies this week?
82351	82451	No.
83015	83335	You sure?
83595	83796	Yeah.
83896	87739	Because I know we got a large sharpened emails this week.
87979	90921	Oh, because I... Because Loki misstated, misrepresented some facts last week.
91041	91902	Oh my god, I made a mistake.
92002	93123	Oh my god, they caught him!
93403	93543	Oh!
94264	94644	Big deal.
94684	100689	You know, I already sent emails to said people, so I have nothing more to say.
101089	101369	You sure?
101409	107934	I didn't notice the optical audio out on every single cable that I own for the Xbox 360.
108695	109535	My bad.
110196	110776	Big deal.
111057	111457	That's it.
111497	112698	That's the only mistake I made, though.
114446	115267	Ever, ever.
116608	121612	I somehow doubt that, but we know that when Loki makes mistakes, the Mac fans will be there to catch him.
121713	122233	That's always good.
122313	123174	Oh, it wasn't about Macs.
123314	129179	I know it wasn't about Macs, but they're the ones that are looking to, you know, get you the best they can.
129680	135164	Anyway, I noticed that, well, there was a story this week too, but maybe we'll get into that later.
135184	135785	We'll see, we'll see.
136235	140578	Anyway, let's start off the show as we always start off the show, talking about our gaming weeks.
140698	141939	DarkSakura, start us off.
141959	142619	How was your gaming week?
143139	144820	Oh, DarkSakura has a mouthful of sandwich.
144840	145621	Let's start with Loki, then.
145661	146421	How was your gaming week?
146821	149103	I played a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
149923	155046	I've been playing, what was it, Joel Quest for some reason, because the achievements are easy.
155587	161470	And, I don't know, the game was really easy until the last few levels, and then it gets really frustrating.
162971	164092	They didn't really kind of...
165563	168025	I don't know, balance out the difficulty over the course of the game.
168045	173429	It should be getting, you know, increasingly harder as it goes along, not just easy, easy, easy, hard, you know.
174530	176391	So I didn't think they did that very well.
176692	189502	And it's really a crapshoot whether it's easy or not because, like, the level I just played a few minutes ago, you know, I played about four times before and I couldn't pass it because it was just impossible to get the blocks in the right positions.
190322	193185	Then, you know, I started up and boom, it's super easy.
193205	194906	I finished it, like, in no time.
196025	197186	Luck plays a huge role in the game.
222065	222365	I don't know.
222425	228648	Maybe sign back on or something, because sometimes if the game doesn't pick up your achievement right away, when you sign back on, it'll give it to you.
228668	229508	That happened to me in Uno.
229908	236190	I was missing two achievements I should have had, and I went back in the game later, and it gave them to me, just right off the bat, pretty much.
236250	236851	It was weird.
237231	238211	Yeah, I don't know.
238751	240712	But then what else was I playing?
242653	246975	Some other game, I think it was Never Ending Warning or something.
247015	247495	It's like some...
249022	249902	Shadow of the Colossus
272788	273808	It was a PC game.
273828	274849	It was for Neverending Story 2.
274929	277950	That doesn't count.
278070	278830	No wonder it was bad.
280091	281191	That movie had The Flash in it.
281591	282632	The guy who played The Flash on TV.
285313	287253	They need to make a game based off the original.
289952	290993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
316297	319338	Played a little bit of New Super Mario Bros., but I'm really sick of that game.
319558	320598	I mean, really sick of it.
321578	323339	And... I don't know.
324939	327400	Are you supposed to be able to unlock some mini-games?
327460	331141	Because I've played it through most of the games so far, and nothing's unlocked.
331261	334161	It's all the same ones that used to be on the Mario 64.
334341	337462	I hear you do unlock others, but I haven't played it quite enough.
337522	338863	But there are some hidden secrets.
338903	341843	Like, have you gotten to the two completely hidden worlds, 4 and 7, yet?
342543	343124	Oh, yeah.
343284	344424	Those are easy to get to, but...
345420	349926	I know, but you might miss them if you don't look for them.
349946	350607	I'm all the way through 7.
351408	355973	I've played through, I've unlocked all those, but I haven't unlocked any of the minigames.
356694	364303	Unless they're just multiplayer exclusive minigames that are brand new to this, but I haven't seen anything new unlocked.
364554	365936	Ion671 seems to agree with you New Super Mario Bros.
365956	366316	gets old fast
380613	382575	We need a re-release of The Guardian Legend.
404561	404821	We do.
404942	406703	We do.
406943	412588	Didn't we have this discussion a while back that somebody owns the rights to that that's never going to make it a new version?
412968	414109	Because Broderbund went under.
414209	415250	It's all on Wikipedia.
415310	416071	Just go to Wikipedia.
416091	416771	All the answers are there.
417091	417712	That's what I remember.
419353	421695	I need to actually get an MSX.
422616	426199	Oh, and I play Blazing Angels multiplayer, which is fun.
426579	427760	Dogfighting during lunch.
429021	433625	The game, though, the only thing that's really disappointing about that game is that you can't crash the planes into each other.
434110	435291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
455700	456360	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
478437	483699	Let's just say, thankfully, that game's not $60, and it's getting some price cuts to a more reasonable amount, so that's cool.
484099	488120	I do think, though, that Burnout Revenge has a really well-done multiplayer mode.
488140	489840	I think multiplayer's a lot of fun to play.
490540	503404	The way it kind of set up, and when you're crashing into people and doing the takedowns, it kind of shows you who your enemies are before the match, and it's all kind of like a movie, the way it presents everything.
503844	506145	It kind of gives you this running commentary on the top of the screen,
506665	507866	So and so has just crashed.
507886	509047	So and so took down so and so.
509107	510589	It's just kind of neat the way it's all presented.
510609	515593	But don't you hate though when you're playing the game and the camera switches and then you crash into something?
515853	517014	Because the camera switched, yeah.
517535	518576	Yeah, it's a little bit annoying.
518596	524441	But you don't get that so much in multiplayer because it can't really stop time as much in multiplayer because everybody's racing at the same time so you don't really get that.
525929	528730	Um... Otherwise, pretty much more of the same.
528770	530391	I've also been playing new Super Mario Bros.
530411	530711	DS.
531011	532232	I'm not quite sick of that yet.
532292	540536	By the way, somebody in chatroom there says, uh... Uh... Ion671 says the new Super Mario games are multi.
540816	543357	So that's where you unlock those, is they're the multiplayer games.
544137	546138	Actually, the multiplayer games are a hell of a lot of fun in there.
546359	547639	You gotta play them at least once.
548519	550540	For multiplayer DS games, they're a lot of fun.
550921	552861	So you gotta try it at least once before you knock it.
553782	553822	Um...
555228	557549	Otherwise, you know, I'm still on jury duty.
557569	559550	If you were listening to last week's show, I've been on a jury.
559630	561471	And I still can't talk about the trial, guys.
561491	561791	Sorry.
562351	566714	Maybe it's supposed to be done early next week, so maybe I can talk about it next Sunday.
567854	571536	But meanwhile, during the downtime, I've been playing Final Fantasy I still.
571576	573397	It's a good game to play at the courthouse.
573957	576098	Keeps me busy when there's a lot, a lot of downtime.
576838	578619	So that's pretty much it.
578719	582121	I did buy off the Xbox Live Arcade WIC Fable of Souls just because...
582898	587080	They haven't released anything on Xbox Live Arcade in forever, so I decided to buy something I didn't have yet.
587561	589762	And I like the concept.
589802	591143	It seems kind of neat so far.
591163	592343	It's pretty lame, isn't it?
592423	593584	I don't know.
593624	596005	I didn't think it was as bad as you said it was in the beginning.
596045	597866	It seems like I'll have fun with it for a little while.
598227	601889	But it's definitely a $5, $10 title.
601909	604830	I think it's $10, and I couldn't see paying much more for it.
605311	608312	It's definitely the type of thing, like a Flash game.
609593	610073	But it's cute.
610233	611334	It'll entertain me for a little while.
612401	613882	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
615904	618065	I actually didn't really play much of anything this week.
618746	624069	You know, I've had a whole week where I've had the time off, and I haven't really felt like playing anything.
624169	631275	So I took a mini vacation from games this week, except that I actually moved a bunch of our game stuff around.
631995	633576	And we have a lot of game stuff at my house.
634277	635738	Oh yeah, we almost got rid of our Virtual Boy.
636840	637581	Why would you do that?
638021	640343	We were going to trade it for help on a pinball machine.
641304	643025	Did I say we got another pinball machine?
643145	643446	We did.
644947	646088	You've had some games this week.
646588	648810	We got a Last Action Hero pinball machine.
649631	654095	Which actually has romantic significance for me and Dan.
654475	659359	Because when I used to work at GNC back in the day... Bit of a big shock, me working at GNC.
660920	665344	When we used to take the deposit, the deposit box was right next to, at the time, a Godfather's Pizza store.
665803	667405	Dan's getting our DS lights today.
686627	687267	Oh, that's right.
687467	689008	I totally forgot.
689028	693449	Until I came into chat room this evening and somebody was talking about it, I forgot that DS Lights had been released today.
694289	695969	I was like, oh yeah, I was going to get one of those.
696189	697410	But I'm holding off this time.
697710	700830	Nintendo is not going to get my money until the new colors come out that I want.
700870	701731	I actually want a white one.
702271	702571	Do you?
702931	703171	Yeah.
703211	703591	I'm going to wait.
703611	706572	I'm going to hold off for something like maybe green, purple, hot pink.
706852	707132	We'll see.
707941	709282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
731189	733009	I know we have some stories coming up in the second half of the show.
733029	738550	They'll talk about functionality between the Wii and the DS, so it'll be kind of interesting to see if they start marketing the two systems together.
738971	739431	So we'll see.
739831	740231	Wii.
740691	740931	Wii.
741171	745052	But I did a little bit of drawing.
745212	752213	I did some Kingdom Hearts-related drawing over the week, but other than that, my week's been pretty.
753113	754213	I forgot I played one more game.
754233	755394	I played DDR this week.
755774	756034	Yeah?
756394	756734	I played
758586	759647	We went to Golf Land.
759727	766229	We were going to go play Miniature Golf, but then we found out that they're closing early because of the grad night thing.
767350	772472	They wanted me to play DDR, but there's people playing the DDR machines except for Disney's Rave, which wasn't being played.
772532	776774	So I had to play Disney's Rave, and I have no stamina anymore.
778302	785565	Of course, I accidentally picked Twilight Zone on doubles, which is a 10, and that's not fun, especially when you're out of shape.
785825	789067	Hey, how many more pounds do you weigh now than when you played DDR religiously?
789207	789787	Oh, I don't remember.
790227	791588	But anyways, good escape.
791708	794569	No, we went and played QZAR instead, though.
795169	795690	Yeah, I heard.
795730	797530	I heard Extraverse say you guys had gone to QZAR.
797871	798311	Good times.
798431	800072	Beat the crap out of everyone like I normally do.
801512	801812	Loser.
802072	803413	How many games of QZAR have you played in your life?
804551	805472	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
831411	832312	Neo Geo, Puzzle Bobble
860129	861812	I guess I will go ahead and start us off tonight.
874342	879084	Anyway, Xbox 360 got some updates finally this week, as you guys may have noticed.
879104	884186	They released it on 6.6.6, which was a great day for 360 to get some new upgrades.
884867	888768	Basically, when you power on your Xbox and connect to Xbox Live, you'll have to download the update.
888788	890089	It doesn't take very long at all.
890809	895851	Now you can download up to six movies, demos, whatever, at a time.
896151	900473	They've kind of re-laid out the store a little bit so that you can find stuff quicker.
900493	902494	They have more categories, and I think they have some...
903895	911840	I still think they need to just reorganize the store completely like the way it's presented, but at least they made improvements to the setup they've got, so I guess I can't complain too much.
912821	915523	One of the things I noticed right off the bat was custom soundtracks.
915623	924069	They made a whole lot better because I use custom soundtracks quite a bit in Uno, which has some really god-awful music, and even in Burnout.
924089	924809	I don't want to listen to the...
926070	926690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
947799	954681	I noticed Xbox Live Arcade games load a lot faster because what it does is when it's scanning your drive for arcade games, it only does that once.
955021	956061	Like it used to do it twice.
956181	961162	It would do it once on the main menu and then when you went in to actually select a game, you'd watch all your games fill in again.
961563	962923	Now it kind of bypasses that.
963243	964123	So it's kind of nice.
964483	969485	So you can get to your games a little faster, especially when you have like 17 games like I do in the Xbox Live Arcade.
969525	969985	It's kind of nice.
971565	980153	Um, if you want to see the full list of upgrades, because there's a whole bunch, DVD player and all that stuff, head on over to Xbox.com and it's in their recent news.
980934	984457	And I downloaded it and I put this thing to the test, not just with the custom soundtracks.
984797	987600	I downloaded three trailers all at once and it worked great.
988000	994146	I even made them, I powered off my machine while one was downloading and then I thought, oh crap, that probably was not a smart idea because you're not supposed to
994526	997808	Turn your machines off while it's riding to the hard drive, but I just kind of forgot it was going.
998189	999990	But I turned it back on and nothing was wrong.
1000270	1001811	It picked right back up and started going again.
1002291	1012638	I wouldn't recommend you guys do this because you might hurt something, but it's nice to know that it's not going to kill your Xbox to turn off the power once or twice while it's downloading.
1014639	1015940	So those are the updates.
1016180	1018862	Loki, did you get a chance to check out the updates at all on your Xbox?
1019082	1020883	Well, I had the update anyways, but no.
1021464	1021584	No.
1022381	1028168	I don't really use custom soundtracks just because I haven't loaded anything on there yet.
1028728	1032352	And when it comes to burnout anyways, I just normally forward to today.
1032933	1036217	And then there's like 40 some tracks in there of all crap.
1037015	1039298	I think there is a way.
1039618	1041500	You can actually sort what plays when.
1044724	1046526	What I do is I stream over the Wi-Fi.
1046746	1048848	That's how I get the custom soundtracks.
1049209	1052653	I stream my MP3 collection from the computer using the MediaConnect thing.
1053113	1054635	I stream that over the Wi-Fi and it works great.
1055075	1058299	You can set up playlists in Winamp and Xbox 360 will read those.
1059062	1059382	DarkSakura
1083522	1084242	Of course I will.
1084302	1086943	Guess what's coming out on the Xbox 360?
1087263	1088724	Street Fighter 2 eventually, I hope?
1089344	1089724	Tetris!
1090224	1090925	Oh, well that's cool.
1091525	1097607	Yep, apparently THQ could get things settled and now we've got Tetris on the 360.
1097647	1108411	Yeah, there was a lawsuit last year against the Tetris company saying that they had breached a contract about releasing the DS version.
1109611	1111292	So now we're getting it on the 360.
1111332	1111432	Okay.
1112452	1114013	We already have it on 360 in Japan.
1115314	1116775	But not in US and Europe.
1117095	1118896	It's coming out actually both in US and Europe.
1118956	1124280	Why isn't it supposed to be coming out like... I mean, I couldn't imagine that there's too much to localize with Tetris.
1124700	1132145	But it's not so much a localization thing as a Nintendo has a Tetris game out right now, so I think there's licensing dispute-y things that have been going on behind the scenes.
1133125	1134646	But they released it first party.
1136127	1137788	So they couldn't say anything.
1138028	1139289	I hope it's good.
1139509	1140910	I haven't touched the Japanese version.
1141050	1141791	I just hope...
1142412	1143112	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1171974	1172895	It was so, so stupid.
1175057	1176838	Alright, moving on.
1177099	1178940	Loki, you have some more news on Xbox.
1179381	1196176	Yes, the creator of such wonderful games like Dead Rising and Lost Planet, Keiji Inafune, basically has come out saying, you know, the Xbox right now, they're up to about 60% of
1198393	1198573	and so on.
1223257	1223577	I don't know.
1224037	1227659	Basically, his comment was, the more years you study a platform, the better you get.
1227959	1231861	Some games you'll see in three to four years will be truly amazing.
1232521	1236223	And, you know, pretty much you can say the same thing about the PlayStation 3.
1236483	1239525	But, I mean, that goes with all game systems out there.
1239545	1245848	I was going to say, this wasn't huge news, because usually when game systems first come out, they aren't exactly reaching their full potential.
1246248	1250810	Well, then you get lazy companies that just want to port crap over, you know, like EA.
1253547	1255628	Not to say EA is the only one, Activision.
1256549	1258190	But I don't know.
1259290	1259830	It's pretty cool.
1260431	1264173	I just want to put out for the record, I looked up Jellico on Wikipedia and they are still in business.
1264633	1266914	But their English website has nothing on it.
1266994	1268355	It's just a picture and a placeholder.
1268375	1270296	So I don't think they're making a lot, but they're still around.
1273098	1274778	They're probably more of a developer now.
1274798	1276659	I might have made them.
1276699	1277920	I'm going off memory, guys.
1278000	1279961	I'm pretty sure they were the ones that had made that.
1280101	1281362	See, now I need to look that up too.
1282967	1284347	Well, I don't know.
1284827	1285608	Dead Rising is awesome.
1285628	1286048	There it is.
1286068	1286688	Tetris Plus.
1287008	1287748	There it is right there.
1287968	1291409	Dead Rising is going to be fucking great.
1292189	1298390	Lost Planet, I wish it was coming out sooner, but it's supposed to be coming out, I think, January.
1299190	1300190	That should be amazing.
1300210	1301271	The demo is really cool.
1301431	1306292	It's not really my kind of game, but I can see where people are really into it.
1306572	1307832	It looked pretty good.
1308217	1309278	Rumble Roses Double X
1336750	1341352	A demo is now up on Xbox Live, as well as brand new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.
1342912	1349615	These were things that were supposed to come out sooner, and there was even an announcement that went out that they'd gone out, but then they got pulled.
1350835	1353616	They're now out there on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1353636	1354216	They're out there now.
1354296	1358858	It's Plaza Trench Rooftops and Gas Plant for 500 points.
1359138	1359458	It's about 625.
1361119	1364320	So if that interests you, check that out on Xbox Live.
1365004	1368045	Perfect Dark Zero just couldn't really get into that game either.
1368425	1368745	I don't know.
1369906	1371807	All the maps in the world won't make that a better game.
1371827	1376928	It's kind of one of those games I'll go back to maybe in a few months and try it again, see if maybe I can kind of get it.
1377268	1380910	But as far as first-person shooters go, I play so few of them anyway.
1380950	1383871	I mean, Halo is cool, and Quake 3, but not Quake 4.
1385371	1386212	But I don't know.
1386232	1387592	I just wasn't feeling Perfect Dark Zero.
1387792	1388953	We're in the age now.
1389573	1389813	It's like 2006.
1390093	1390693	We're approaching 2007.
1393584	1396605	and yet companies can't grasp jump technology.
1397465	1400846	The ability to jump in games is very important because we have feet.
1401066	1402827	They do other things other than walk and run.
1402927	1403647	They can jump.
1405588	1407568	Maybe that should have been in Perfect Dark.
1411049	1413070	Loki, you have some more news about Xbox Live.
1414230	1420512	Basically, there's a whole bunch of releases that were supposedly leaked out there from a magazine.
1421575	1427899	One of those, of course, being Street Fighter 2, which is supposed to be coming out in July, we hope.
1428219	1428939	I don't believe it anymore.
1429019	1429820	No, I thought it was June.
1430120	1430800	June, July.
1430940	1432101	I don't believe it anymore, anyway.
1432121	1433262	Forget it.
1433342	1433862	It doesn't matter.
1434222	1436243	There's been so many release dates for that game.
1437084	1438284	It'll be out whenever they're ready.
1438304	1439005	Yeah, exactly.
1439025	1440445	I'm sick of speculating on dates.
1440465	1450711	They're saying June, but then again, this is from a magazine, and if we've come to learn anything from magazines, they're printed way the hell in advance, and
1451496	1452377	Luminous Live $1200
1478564	1479164	Thanks for watching!
1496164	1504326	It'll be 200, 300, 100 points to download Madonna, you know, whatever else they're planning on putting in there from other artists.
1504446	1506907	Those high-name artists will probably cost a little money.
1507887	1511148	If there's profit to be made, Luminous will cost even more money.
1511608	1516209	But, you know, the game on the PSP costs $19.99, so, you know.
1516689	1519070	But, of course, on that one you have the perk of you have it on the go.
1520110	1524171	Some of the other ones that were confirmed, though, and this is actually confirmed with Namco...
1524916	1530460	Pac-Man is going to be out sometime in August or September for 400 Microsoft points or 5 bucks.
1531381	1536785	Also, supposedly coming around the same time, I believe, was Frogger.
1537325	1539167	Supposed to be coming out from Konami.
1539527	1540908	Also about the same price.
1541668	1543790	And there was another Namco game, too.
1543870	1544931	I can't remember.
1544971	1546192	Was it Pac-Man or Galaxian?
1546412	1549034	Galaxian was the other one, yeah.
1549074	1550915	And then, of course, some other ones that they mentioned...
1552523	1560088	The Cameo Hardcore Package featuring more difficult versions of the single-player campaign and co-op campaigns.
1561329	1568174	More skins and new leaderboards, plus some more co-op competitive elements.
1569115	1572778	That's supposed to be coming out in July for 500 Microsoft points, or 625.
1573118	1577481	Cloning Clyde, also in July for 800 Microsoft points, or 10 bucks.
1578242	1581484	And Robo Blitz, sometime in August or September.
1582079	1584120	for 800 Microsoft Points or $10.
1585681	1593366	Well, they need some games to come out in June because there's only one Xbox 360... No, two now because one moved to June again.
1594066	1594426	What's that?
1595267	1596107	Over G Fighters.
1596828	1601290	Over G Fighters and MotoGP 2006 are the only ones coming out in June right now.
1603091	1605693	Comments from our chat room over at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.
1605733	1606353	Click on chat.
1606653	1611336	Funnydale says, If anything, Microsoft should give us $6.25 for making us play Perfect Dark.
1613136	1618102	DMN says Sky Rare refuses to use jump features in their first person shooters.
1619303	1619723	Interesting.
1620524	1621365	I wonder where that comes from.
1622547	1626851	Alright, anyway, going over to DarkSakura who has some more news for us.
1627352	1628993	This one also relating to Xbox.
1629354	1629975	Yeah, there's a...
1630985	1638529	Rumor out from an introversion that Darwinia is going to be available on Xbox Live Arcade.
1641671	1649095	Really, some of the support for this is that basically there's other versions of Darwinia out.
1649556	1655739	They said there's been talk actually from Microsoft, I think, that they've been really wanting to use it.
1658078	1661543	There's been a lot of just talk going around that says it's really going to happen.
1661643	1663946	See, I've heard a lot of good about Darwinia.
1664307	1670275	Yeah, it's a really popular indie title, and I know we've gotten emails on it even before, and I've heard a discussion about the game on other shows.
1670356	1672579	Some of our listeners overseas.
1673072	1676893	Yeah, and that would be really cool if that does hit Xbox Live.
1676913	1680174	That's huge exposure for it, and it's a good marriage.
1680514	1688435	Xbox Live Arcade is supposed to be set up to help out the indie developers, so I hope it works out for them and give it some easy achievements for the achievement points horse.
1690336	1697217	Loki, for those that like to do things to their Xbox 360s that could void the warranty, there's some news.
1697397	1698298	Yes, of course.
1698798	1700458	Modchip's coming out, finally.
1701555	1708460	This website, devil360.com, actually they were trying to release it on 666, but weren't done in time.
1709201	1718427	Because they're actually trying to improve it right now to try to protect it from any type of updates, make it programmable via PC, and able to boot unsigned code.
1719107	1727873	It'll allow you to swap the hard drive with a larger drive using a special interface between the 360 and the hard drive, and a lot more.
1729269	1735493	So basically they're saying that it's going to be due out probably sometime by the end of this year.
1735613	1738515	But they're still working on it right now.
1739656	1740477	But it's coming soon.
1742198	1742898	Coming soon.
1743739	1745680	Won't Microsoft just put out a patch?
1746881	1758489	It might be something that they might not be able to patch because they may be able to... I mean, if you think about it, okay, Xbox, the original Xbox...
1759397	1760337	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1785046	1791368	Well, don't forget, you can hook in a keyboard into your Xbox 360, kind of like Final Fantasy XI on the Xbox 360.
1791868	1795449	You can play it with a controller, but I really wouldn't recommend it.
1796229	1797890	Well, I mean, okay, I take that back.
1799210	1807773	You can use the controller if you have really good macros set up, but even to put in the macros, you really need a keyboard to do all that and to chat with people, I mean, if you ever want to chat.
1808213	1814055	I mean, you can get away with most of the basic elements using, you know, good macros with a controller, but you really need a keyboard for that game.
1815060	1817181	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1841722	1843583	I joined some server extifers on.
1843643	1848885	Something about get the characters to level 19 and do nothing but battlegrounds is what they're wanting to do.
1849245	1850225	Him and some other friends.
1850245	1851205	Can I have my server with me too?
1851405	1855567	I'll do one that's all the way to level 60 if I stick with the game that long.
1855627	1856187	What server are you on?
1856207	1859908	I'm on Scarlet Crusade for my alliance and Bronzebeard for my horde.
1860328	1861429	Alright, we'll see.
1862069	1864710	I'm on Elder Thalys is the one I'm working with the level 19 on.
1865110	1866250	I might make one on there.
1866790	1868551	My characters are still noob level.
1868811	1869111	We'll see.
1869915	1871475	Alright, moving on.
1872336	1872616	What?
1873316	1874616	I'm going to go to the Nintendo Wii.
1876217	1880138	Best Buy has listed Nintendo Wii games for pre-order.
1881058	1883799	And actually, I'm checking the link right now to see if they're actually still up.
1884359	1885260	Yes, sure enough, they are.
1885340	1889441	It shows Red Steel, Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Smash Bros.
1889521	1891421	Brawl all coming out December 1st, 2006.
1891862	1895983	And if you believe those release dates... You're an idiot.
1896043	1896683	Yeah, um...
1897575	1907399	Obviously those release dates are just in the system to try and get pre-orders moving, you know, amongst some of those really hotly talked about games such as Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros.
1907439	1907779	Brawl.
1908439	1916542	I really don't know why this is news, but just for those people that think these are actual release dates and this points to, oh, the Wii's coming out December 1st.
1916702	1921604	No, the Wii will be out before the day before Thanksgiving, or the day after Thanksgiving.
1922244	1923285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1954113	1958035	I'd be surprised if the PS3 launches on the date that they said it will.
1959515	1961796	I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't launch until next year.
1964658	1969440	Not to say they can't pull it off and it could be a really great system with lots of cool games.
1970180	1972401	But they're going to be working some massive overtime over it.
1972581	1976523	They're going to seriously need the help of some leprechauns to make this thing happen.
1978260	1979020	We'll see, we'll see.
1979661	1979961	You know what?
1980001	1981062	Don't count Sony out yet.
1981122	1983683	So what if they kind of lost E3, so to speak, you know?
1984123	1984764	They could come back.
1984804	1987485	And Sony fanboys know that in the back of their mind.
1987505	1994890	I think the best interest of Sony right now is to get all of their upper people to stop saying stupid shit.
1995410	1996231	That's what they need to do.
1996371	1996691	Actually...
1997868	2000089	Maybe Sony could benefit from a gag order.
2000169	2001930	Kind of like Nintendo has, kind of, sort of.
2002010	2005712	Nintendo doesn't really, but Nintendo they don't let out a lot of secrets.
2006192	2008874	Or when they do let out secrets, it's very carefully timed.
2009434	2009994	The way they do it.
2010835	2011275	So I don't know.
2012656	2013616	Alright, anyway.
2014717	2016257	It's because Nintendo hires smart people.
2017378	2020500	Anyway, moving on to some release dates that we do know about.
2020780	2026082	DarkSakura, you like to travel the globe and tell our buddies in Europe what they have to look forward to.
2026663	2027283	Um, some
2028439	2031700	Well, not very exciting things unless you're a PC gamer, I guess.
2032540	2035281	Copa Inata is coming out on PC.
2035401	2039062	Ship Simulator 2006 is coming out on the 15th.
2039302	2040662	The first game was out on the 13th.
2041442	2044703	And then coming up on the 16th is Glory of the Roman Empire.
2045863	2053285	Also on the 16th for DS we have Miss Spider, Harvest Time, Hop and Fly, and The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle Earth 2 on Xbox 360 on the 16th.
2053365	2053625	All right.
2057566	2061788	Moving over stateside, Loki, you know any good releases for the US coming up?
2061808	2068651	There's actually some pretty cool stuff, and one of them that I'm definitely getting this week, Point Blank for the DS is coming out, finally.
2069631	2080196	On the Game Boy Advance, if you're a fan of the Mega Man Battle Network games, Mega Man Battle Network 6, Falzar, and Gregar are going to be both coming out.
2081216	2084838	Also, coming out on PC, we've got Darwinia.
2085818	2085898	Um,
2086812	2095934	Ultimate Quake, Rush for Berlin, Rise and Fall of Civilizations at War, Deep Sea Tycoon, a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff.
2097374	2107236	Also on PlayStation 2, of course, Armored Core Last Raven, Street Fighter Alpha Anthology, and Urban Chaos Riot Response, which is also coming out on Xbox.
2107756	2111817	And then for the PSP, you've got the Metal Gear Solid Digital Collection,
2112322	2112943	and 360 MotoGP 2006
2120035	2127096	Moving on, we were talking about the PlayStation 3 a little bit ago, and of course one game a lot of folks are looking forward to on the PlayStation 3 is Metal Gear Solid 4.
2127756	2131897	And there were some new details about Metal Gear Solid 4 announced in a very recent interview.
2132477	2135818	Hideo Kojima said that there's a new camo suit that Snake's going to have.
2135858	2137138	It's the OctoCam.
2137518	2142659	And what this will do is it will change shape and color to match the surroundings that Snake has.
2143279	2146660	These chameleon effects are going to happen automatically whenever Snake is resting.
2147000	2148040	So it sounds kind of interesting.
2148060	2148901	Kind of like the trailer.
2149161	2152142	Could be a graphically impressive sort of event, so we'll see.
2152742	2161265	So Kojima's dropping little hints left and right about Metal Gear Solid 4, just enough to remind the fans it's coming out and they better be supporting PlayStation 3, like it or not.
2162946	2169548	Loki, here's another game that as the release date gets pushed back and pushed back, it's harder and harder to support, but the fans love it.
2170829	2171229	Okay.
2172489	2173150	Basically...
2174912	2179474	Take Two has said that Duke Nukem Forever will be out by December 31st.
2182294	2183415	That's a bold statement.
2183455	2184435	You mean it this time?
2184635	2185916	Do you really mean it this time?
2185936	2187236	Well, they've got an incentive now.
2187776	2194939	As it was, they're not giving the full funding for the game.
2195419	2197019	I believe originally it was $6 million.
2197039	2197720	Now they're down to $4.25 million.
2197740	2198640	And there's a $500,000 incentive
2204824	2206445	Thank you for watching!
2221946	2224408	That's mighty breath to hold right there.
2224649	2226570	This game better kick ass.
2227391	2227972	Seriously.
2228252	2238121	With all this anticipation and all this waiting that's gone into it, this game better kick some ass so we can all eat our words and we've been bashing all these delays.
2238161	2238961	It better be worth it.
2239662	2241524	This game will have to be better than sex.
2242585	2244026	This game will have to do my laundry.
2244747	2245167	Seriously.
2246088	2248310	So whether or not it'll come out,
2249614	2251975	I don't think anyone cares at this point.
2252476	2252856	I don't know.
2252996	2253456	You know what?
2253756	2256418	Duke Nukem 3D, a lot of love for that game.
2256598	2260800	Even 10 years later after the game was released, still a lot of love for that game.
2260860	2262741	There's people out there that will support it.
2262821	2265343	Put it on the goddamn Xbox Live Arcade.
2266423	2267284	What, Duke Nukem 3D?
2267384	2267844	Hell yeah.
2267864	2269365	That would actually be pretty sweet.
2270466	2271886	You think realistically that would ever happen?
2271906	2272467	No.
2272487	2272667	No?
2273223	2273843	But it could.
2273903	2275484	I mean, the game's small enough.
2276064	2282345	And, well, I would imagine that the Xbox 360 would have the power to, I don't know, play that game.
2282506	2284766	So, I think it could be cool.
2284826	2288347	They should have done the same thing with Quake 2 instead of releasing it with Quake 4.
2288607	2290708	I think that could have been pretty cool.
2293609	2294009	Let's see.
2294309	2299310	In reference to a topic we were talking about earlier, JeremyTodd1 says, Duke Nukem is the never-starting story.
2300490	2300650	Get it?
2300670	2301751	Because we had never-ending story, right?
2301771	2302051	Get it?
2302071	2302311	All right.
2304847	2307609	And now everybody's talking about vaporware, so to speak.
2307669	2310151	Fireboma says, hey guys, let's go play on our Phantoms.
2310951	2312012	Actually, Phantoms are coming out.
2312712	2314954	Well, yeah, but so is Duke Nukem Forever.
2314974	2320838	Well, yeah, but I'm saying that they've, I mean, even though they've kept pushing back the date, they actually did have a date set for release.
2321838	2324260	Okay, and yeah, sure, they'll hit that, you know.
2324280	2324760	Well, we'll see.
2324800	2329523	Maybe they will and we can all... I say at the end of the year it goes and it hasn't released at that point, I'll consider it vaporware.
2329544	2330264	All right.
2332145	2334707	Like I'm actually going to care about getting one, but, you know.
2334909	2340213	QuickSilver over in our chatroom is saying, I want Mortal Kombat on Xbox Live Arcade.
2341133	2342434	They are coming out with Mortal Kombat 3.
2343175	2346437	It's either Mortal Kombat 3 or Ultimate Mortal Kombat or one of those.
2347077	2349919	Why can't they put out the only good one they had, which was Mortal Kombat 2?
2352558	2352958	I don't know.
2353199	2357642	Maybe because, well, see... Mortal Kombat 3 was like when the series started to go crappy.
2357862	2370771	Mortal Kombat 2 is available on the Midway packs or whatever, but then again, so is Mortal Kombat 3, but I don't think, I could be wrong, but I don't think Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was available in those Midway treasures or whatever it was called.
2371151	2373293	And plus, you couldn't play them online either, which is a huge...
2374253	2379835	All it is is that because Street Fighter is coming out, Mortal Kombat has to come out.
2380215	2383736	It's one of the greatest video game competitions ever.
2383916	2385317	Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat.
2385957	2387618	You know what we need is a new Killer Instinct.
2388638	2389058	Good luck.
2389518	2390919	I don't know, but that would make me so happy.
2390939	2391999	That would make me happy too.
2392079	2393539	I was a Killer Instinct fangirl.
2393619	2394160	Good luck.
2396080	2398101	Yeah, they'd take out the jump feature in that one too.
2400757	2406642	Alright, we're going to go over to our mailbag over at mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is our email address.
2407302	2409744	And DarkSakura likes to dig through the mailbag.
2409764	2415649	She's going to put on her hazmat suit and pull out some emails and share them with us so we can taunt your emails live on air.
2416450	2416950	No, just kidding.
2416970	2418191	We love getting mail of all types.
2418812	2424116	Even the hate mail we got this week thanks to Loki's uninformed statement on Xbox Sound Support last week.
2424136	2424717	Good job, Loki.
2424837	2425337	Yeah, whatever.
2425497	2427399	Alright, DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag?
2428301	2440188	The first one comes from Kurt, one of our listeners It's like, hey I was wondering if you guys could fill me in on the rules that Sony may have regarding how many PS3s each person will be allowed to buy Or is there only one per household allowed?
2440488	2444210	Will people be selling the PS3 on eBay for megabucks like the PS2 and the Xbox 360?
2446311	2447232	Yeah, I'm sure they will
2447765	2450207	I'm sure they'll be selling as many as they can possibly sell.
2450627	2452729	I don't think Sony sets those limits though, right?
2452749	2456592	It stores the retailers how many they can sell to make sure that they fit all the orders.
2456652	2463077	Yeah, retailers will be setting those limits and most retailers, if the PS3 is a hot commodity, will have the one limit.
2463337	2468641	And probably at launch, I think Sony's still going to pull out an ace somehow.
2468661	2473185	They're going to make this work somehow and have at least one title out there that the fanboys are going to have to have.
2473725	2475947	I still say if you're going to buy one, pre-order it.
2476704	2478445	Put down a reserve on it.
2478465	2479906	That is the smart way to do it.
2480867	2484250	And like all of you people who tried to go in and buy your Xbox 360 on launch day.
2484410	2484990	Ha ha!
2485111	2493977	Don't count on E3's bust for Sony, essentially, to be meaning that they're going to be easy to get.
2493997	2495779	Stores are only going to get limited quantities.
2495859	2497880	If you don't pre-order it, I doubt you're going to get one on launch day.
2497900	2501223	Well, it doesn't matter anyways, because you're not going to get one on launch day even if you do pre-order it.
2501801	2502161	Remember the 360?
2502942	2504122	People were getting them in March.
2504482	2507083	The people who pre-ordered theirs first got theirs first.
2507103	2509784	They're supposed to be altering that, so it doesn't happen this time either.
2510224	2511285	You can't pre-order them right now.
2513846	2516347	Last year, you could have pre-ordered a 360 right now.
2516987	2518007	You know, at this time last year.
2518267	2521229	But they're not doing that with the PlayStation 3 because they learned their lesson.
2522649	2524050	At least the big, big retailers.
2524530	2526451	GameStop and EB Games, as far as games go.
2526991	2527551	Alright, more mail.
2528692	2535721	Another of our listeners asked if we know of any upcoming DVR games for PS2.
2537582	2538402	DDR Supernova.
2539503	2541464	And that's pretty much the only one here in the States.
2541964	2545205	I'm sure UK is getting Dancing Stage Supernova as well.
2546185	2551587	DDR Supernova, there's actually a little in-depth look on our website, and I think it's still on the front page.
2551607	2552587	I don't think it's rolled off yet.
2553168	2556609	Over at www.orangenautorated.com, and there's video of it in motion and everything.
2557029	2557949	That was from John, by the way.
2558249	2558970	Yes, thank you, John.
2559470	2562991	But yeah, that's pretty much all there is to look forward to as far as DDR goes and Supernova.
2563691	2565012	So far for the past, what,
2565852	2571616	5 years now, Konami's been putting out pretty regularly a new DDR game every year on Sony's platform.
2571656	2579040	So you can count on probably another one next year as well, unless for some unknown reason Supernova doesn't sell, but I really don't see that happening.
2579060	2581342	I think it'll sell just as well as the other games, if not better.
2582722	2589446	Next one up is JVmon, who I am very, very proud of, writing a letter to the senator.
2590267	2591928	Oh yes, I remember talking about that on a previous episode.
2592379	2596981	And basically, just in closing, said, so any help and input would be greatly appreciated.
2597241	2600483	And I love OLR, Sky and DarkSakura, you inspired me to write my senator.
2601123	2602143	Oh yeah, and Loki is awesome.
2603864	2607406	But yeah, I'm not going to go into it because it's fairly long already.
2607926	2614849	But the arguments are basically what we've been talking about, about the parents' responsibility to decide what their children do.
2616638	2618460	We don't want to put the pen to the paper for you.
2619161	2622445	I would say the only suggestions we really have is just be professional.
2623006	2624248	Make sure you sound professional.
2624488	2625750	Research your points.
2626371	2627512	Yeah, best you can.
2628012	2639560	I mean, if you've been listening to, you read enough video game websites, especially things like Game Politics that really have their eye on these types of things, and listen to enough shows, you probably are well-educated on the subjects.
2639721	2640461	Just write maturely.
2640601	2646946	If you're trying to, I say if you're trying to refute an argument, though, have facts to back up why you're refuting it and what's gonna, that's what I meant.
2647506	2648046	Oh, sure.
2648227	2650188	Have the facts there to support your argument.
2650288	2653830	Yeah, please don't write your senator a letter that says, Dear Senator, I am a registered voter.
2654151	2655351	Fuck you, you fucking fuck.
2655532	2658574	Don't do that because that's just going to get thrown away and you'll look stupid.
2658594	2659554	They'll probably laugh at you.
2659834	2662096	Yeah, so you need to write something mature.
2662977	2672463	So we got an email from, I'm going to hopefully pronounce this right, Tasete Pueri, I guess.
2673104	2674424	He's also, I think, in our chat room right now.
2674985	2675165	Hi.
2675185	2675225	Hi.
2677000	2680382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2700749	2701929	I'd say it all depends on what you're going for.
2702170	2714274	If you want something that's going to be a good work-oriented computer, something that you can run your programs well on, something you can do graphics in well, something that you can write on well, something that you can basically use as a work system, Mac is the way to go.
2714934	2718295	Something that's going to be on a more professional level.
2718776	2722857	If you want something that you can play games on and just futz around on the internet with, PC is the way to go.
2723397	2725418	My advice, try before you buy.
2725838	2728319	Any computer store, if you're going to make a major purchase like that,
2728709	2732750	Any major computer store is going to have the computers out there on the show floor, especially like the Apple Store.
2732770	2734511	You know, they encourage people to be playing on their Macs.
2735011	2740633	And, you know, any type of big retailer for PCs, Best Buy, Fry's, whatever, they have laptops out on the floor.
2741033	2741693	Try it before you buy.
2742133	2743714	And also, yeah.
2744114	2744954	Take all the time you need.
2744974	2745755	Don't rush the decision.
2746315	2747695	Also, yeah, there's a bar mitzvah on Saturday, so.
2747715	2749356	Mazel tov.
2749436	2750076	Mazel tov.
2750176	2750796	All right.
2751296	2754877	So I just thought that we would go ahead and give you our public yay.
2754897	2755438	All right.
2755478	2756118	Congratulations.
2756398	2756518	Yep.
2757294	2779684	Jeremy Todd writes in just to read the letter I just want to thank you for giving me something to listen to during work to help make the hours go by faster my job is a pretty boring job at times we won't tell your boss and having something to listen to really helps a lot I have been downloading a few older episodes of OLR and listen to them while I'm at work so thank you for providing such a good podcast to listen to in desperate times you're welcome
2781299	2789926	We do this show for fun, and we always get a kick out of the fact that people listen to this and provide feedback and all that stuff, so it really keeps us motivated, so thank you.
2790467	2792929	We also got an email from Tony.
2793649	2798373	I haven't had a chance to watch the file yet, so I'm just going to read the email.
2798733	2802616	It says, I just watched a rerun of the Colbert Report on Comedy Central for June 8th.
2803717	2805719	I know you don't watch a lot of TV, so I'll forgive you for that.
2805739	2807200	It's actually the Colbert Report.
2807280	2808481	Okay, I don't watch TV.
2808501	2809442	I know you don't watch TV, but...
2810078	2818361	Steven's guest explains how video games are actually helping this generation of kids and implies that GTA might contribute to this nation's decrease in carjackings and teen pregnancies.
2820402	2826464	It's all done... The show is a parody, essentially, of shows like The O'Reilly Factor, and so it's all very tongue-in-cheek when they do that stuff.
2826484	2827105	It's still a point, though.
2827525	2836668	I could see how maybe World of Warcraft would lead to decline of pregnancy because they're too busy playing the video game in order to, I don't know, have sex.
2836688	2837849	It's like...
2838627	2839368	Sex or an instance?
2839428	2839988	Sex or an instance?
2858471	2875228	sex is any time and instance is in like two minutes seriously I don't know it depends on sometimes sex is an instance but hey alright anyway la la la la la la that's it alright if you want to send us emails please do mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
2875982	2879985	Loki, speaking of MMOs and sex and instances, what a good follow-up.
2880266	2881126	You got a story for us.
2881426	2888072	Yes, lots of gamers are finding love online in fake virtual worlds like World of Warcraft and whatnot.
2888432	2903104	Anyways, a survey conducted by Stanford University's Nick Yee, a PhD student there, found that 29% of women and 8% of men have admitted to have gone on dates with people that they've met in the games.
2903824	2904405	And the
2904935	2910119	He attributes that phenomenon to the trust-building exercises of working in team scenarios.
2910679	2919986	How one player acts during an in-game raid may reveal traits relative to the avatar's personality through situations that are less common in the real world.
2920426	2924529	So, say for example, we would take, you know, Leroy Jenkins.
2925049	2928191	He might rush into things a little bit, you know, too quickly.
2928251	2929192	He might not be a good mate.
2930133	2933515	But, uh... I don't know.
2935398	2940822	It was interesting they mentioned one guy was setting up for two weddings, one in real life and one in game.
2942263	2942683	Nerd!
2943144	2944344	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
2945225	2946566	You know, I met my husband online.
2948067	2949788	You know... Through our geekdom.
2950869	2952690	No, I realized in this...
2953658	2957984	Day and age that we live in, the internet is a place that we can meet people.
2958025	2964835	Remember back in the day, maybe if you have an older brother or sister, they talked about party lines that you could call into on the phone.
2964855	2965896	That's what chat rooms are.
2966237	2967178	It's party lines, basically.
2967218	2967458	It's just...
2969681	2972062	Cybersex is like phone sex too.
2972282	2978344	But when you throw the MMO into it, it does get a little weird.
2978604	2982265	I mean, you know, because people are like roleplaying elves and dwarves and all that.
2982725	2987506	Wow, you were a hot elf in that game, but now you're a fat cow.
2987586	2990267	So I don't know, this kind of mixes things up a bit.
2990427	2992708	But at the same time, you know, I'm not going to knock.
2993564	2994744	Two people falling in love.
2994864	2996765	If it's genuine, you know what?
2997225	2998145	Love's a great thing.
2998245	2999405	Doesn't matter how it happened.
2999565	2999985	Whatever.
3000265	3005467	I had Dan's high school photo to go on when we first met.
3006607	3008467	Keep in mind, I was 22 when I moved out here.
3009167	3012088	God, it was that long ago.
3013128	3021030	I thought it was great because we actually got to know each other as people without having the whole
3024224	3028305	I do think it is important, though, to make sure that the person that you're talking to is not looking like a yeti.
3048177	3057768	I don't think it matters what the other person looks like as long as their heart is good and you love them for themselves.
3058288	3060291	Yeti people need love too, Loki.
3060371	3060791	Come on.
3061372	3064115	It doesn't mean you have to love them, but you know...
3064656	3066237	You know, somebody might have a Yeti fetish.
3066517	3067057	You don't know.
3067077	3068878	Well, there are furry fetishes out there.
3068918	3081423	I think it's really sad, though, just how much people base their whole relationship on, oh, well, this person's hot, or, oh, well, this person is this, you know, aesthetically, instead of actually putting the importance on who they are on the inside.
3081803	3087045	And so I think that, I honestly think that you open yourself up for a lot of risk.
3087225	3092647	However, if you do happen to hit pay dirt, then you're going to get someone who I think is a bit,
3093556	3097757	I think that you have a chance of getting a more genuine person when you do find somebody.
3099637	3105558	If I'm looking for a good running car or whatever, I don't want one that's all beat up on the outside.
3107839	3116041	Actually, I am from somebody who said that two of her friends met on World of Warcraft and got married three months ago.
3117361	3117701	Wow.
3118221	3118401	Wow.
3119847	3120347	Thank you for watching!
3139937	3140898	Let them do whatever they want.
3141498	3144661	If they want to roleplay taurens and orcs in the bedroom, have fun.
3144801	3145481	Do your thing.
3146482	3147402	Don't put it on YouTube.
3147422	3148903	I don't want to see it.
3149144	3159811	But still, I think that people who meet through online methods, whether it be an MMO, whether it be through a chat, through a message board, if it works for you, more power to you.
3160071	3160972	Or at a bar.
3161072	3161372	You know what?
3161392	3163013	Picking up people at a bar is pretty scummy.
3163814	3164694	No, not always.
3164754	3165835	Not always, but you know what?
3165975	3166876	A lot of times it can be.
3167603	3169224	Bars are pretty sleazy sometimes.
3169544	3170505	I mean, you know what?
3173447	3174308	Meet people at church.
3174328	3176169	That's the only clean place.
3176269	3177570	That's not a clean place.
3178071	3179091	Church going people.
3179772	3179932	No.
3180312	3180613	All right.
3181233	3181633	Let's see.
3183054	3186016	Bob in our chat room says, well, what about those balloon fetish people?
3186097	3187758	Pop a balloon and they'll be all over you.
3188538	3190219	I have a feeling someone missed the point there.
3190260	3190720	That's all right.
3191861	3194883	Dirty Thief said someone's going to bang a chocobo.
3195816	3200138	And in reference to doing the MMOs, sex and the MMOs.
3200799	3202299	Boy, you kids have a lot of free time.
3203140	3203700	Moving on.
3205301	3209883	If you do play too many video games, you might need to take a trip to the Netherlands.
3211184	3213085	Because they have set up an addiction center.
3214051	3218073	It's the first detox clinic for video game addicts.
3219154	3230940	Video games may look innocent, but they can be just as addictive as gambling or drugs and just as hard to kick, says Keith Backer, director of Amsterdam-based Smith & Jones Addiction Consultants.
3231000	3236163	He's already treated 20 video game addicts aged 13 to 30.
3237104	3240706	Some of them will show withdrawal systems, shaking, sweating, whatever.
3241006	3243227	His detox program begins in July 2021.
3243587	3251650	It runs 4-8 weeks and has therapy sessions, wilderness excursions, healthy lifestyle workshops, and possibly medication.
3252710	3255071	Let's see, another quote here from Backer.
3255151	3262554	We have kids who don't know how to communicate with people face-to-face because they've spent the last three years talking to somebody in Korea through a computer.
3262894	3265035	Their social network has completely disappeared.
3265395	3267536	Hey, hey, hey, they can't be blaming this on Korea.
3269884	3271386	Hike van der Heijen 28 was a graduate of the Amsterdam side of this.
3271406	3272987	He started playing video games when he was 8.
3273067	3276831	By the time he was in college, he was gaming 14 hours a day and using drugs to play longer, which is
3292526	3293006	That's pathetic.
3293046	3294447	That's a whole other problem.
3294527	3296128	That's not a gaming problem.
3296148	3297048	That's a whole other problem.
3297068	3299349	That's called obsessive compulsive disorder.
3299369	3301390	Does that count as cheating on live?
3303091	3304412	Getting coked up before playing?
3304552	3307293	If I'm on speed, I have that advantage.
3307994	3308934	Can I say the quote, please?
3308994	3309934	Here's the quote from the kid.
3310595	3314857	For me, one joint would never be enough, or five minutes of gaming would never be enough, he said.
3315277	3317118	I would just keep going until I crashed out.
3318601	3333206	Okay, so like when I first read about this story, I was kind of laughing at it, because my thought went to, you know, I've been downtown all week at the courthouse, you know, during the jury duty, and one of the things I walk by is a, I'm not, I don't want to knock
3333966	3344337	I'm not going to name what religion it is, but you go by a very religious type of like a store type thing, and they have in the window, do you have a gaming addiction problem?
3344677	3347079	No, it's listed in listening.
3347099	3350102	It's like, are you addicted to sex, violence, gaming?
3350623	3351424	And I was kind of like...
3352512	3355433	Oh boy, you know, I just kind of roll my eyes at it and keep on walking.
3355473	3360576	But, you know, these guys that I'm reading about in this story, they really do have problems and do need some type of intervention.
3360636	3362797	So maybe this isn't such a bad idea as it seems.
3363137	3368699	I think the media is just kind of putting a spin on this story where, you know, it's about, you know, oh, it's gaming.
3368739	3371601	They're just, they're obsessed with gaming and gaming is the problem.
3372081	3374222	No, these guys obviously have a lot of other problems.
3374242	3374582	There's something.
3374722	3375203	Underline.
3375223	3376544	Gaming just contributes too.
3376585	3380469	When you start reading these testimonials, I mean, if he was doing drugs too, that's a whole nother problem.
3380549	3383093	He was getting sex, he wouldn't have any of these problems.
3384358	3387940	So the moral of the story, kids, you know, what was one of the treatments here?
3388060	3389480	Wilderness excursions.
3389981	3390861	It's very easy.
3390901	3392822	You can go on your own wilderness excursion.
3392862	3393422	Here's what you do.
3393942	3399505	After you've played the game, like if you've played the game for more than like four hours a day, it's time to go outside for an hour.
3399925	3404227	Walk around, breathe in some fresh air, take a wilderness excursion, and don't let this become you.
3404287	3406308	I don't know if wilderness excursions are a good idea.
3406728	3408609	How do you think LARPs came around?
3408749	3410970	I mean, do we really need more of that?
3411130	3412971	Hey, LARPs are, I used to do LARPs.
3415080	3417542	I could play games outside!
3419504	3420244	Oh my gosh.
3420284	3421165	Fireball!
3421245	3424868	It's the same as going to reenactments.
3424888	3426889	Reenactments actually have historical significance.
3427029	3427610	Oh, snap.
3428771	3429571	Or going to Ren Faire.
3429631	3435235	It's reenact the Civil War, but this time the South won.
3435556	3439919	Again, I'm not one to knock what somebody else is into, but I did go to a Ren Faire once.
3441175	3442256	and kind of roll my eyes at it.
3442276	3442676	I'm sorry.
3442876	3443697	It just wasn't for me.
3443777	3445078	But I'm not going to... A Ren Faire is fun.
3445138	3446680	I'm not going to knock people... Whatever.
3446900	3447720	You know, do what makes you happy.
3447801	3453545	It's all about getting your pint of ale and chatting up the men in tights.
3453805	3455947	A Ren Faire is like... Maybe the Ren Faire I went to just sucked.
3455967	3456207	I don't know.
3456227	3458069	A Ren Faire is just like an old-fashioned Hooters.
3458189	3459590	Lots of boobs, lots of chicken.
3459610	3461091	I mean, that's basically what it is.
3462272	3463774	So there's nothing wrong with a Ren Faire.
3464034	3466096	Plus, you get to see people fight with swords.
3466416	3467377	And that's kind of cool.
3467957	3470099	That's the only thing missing from Hooters is sword fighting.
3475327	3477389	Sometimes I wonder why we have you on the show, Loki.
3477409	3479290	And then you say little gems like that to remind me.
3480811	3482132	Let's go to another story now.
3482332	3485574	Actually, I'm curious what the chat room has to say in feedback to the detox story here.
3486195	3486575	Let's see.
3491018	3493360	Raven's Dolphin says they need an OLR clinic.
3493420	3494080	I am addicted.
3494241	3495441	Well, that's lovely.
3495602	3503827	But just remember, you can put Orange Lounge Radio on your iPod or whatever MP3 player you have, and you can go outside and take a walk and listen to Orange Lounge Radio if you wanted to.
3505401	3506902	Loki, you have another story for us.
3507342	3513285	Yes, it's about the Federal Trade Commission and their never-ending quest to waste my tax money.
3514226	3529714	Basically, they've investigated the hot coffee problem and they found out that, well, apparently Take-Two didn't fully reveal the content of the PC versions to the ESRB.
3530970	3532030	So, what are they doing?
3532390	3536851	Well, they're saying, better not do it again or else we'll fine you.
3537071	3537572	Yay.
3538332	3544413	And they're going to fine them, supposedly, a civil fine up to $11,000 per violation.
3544873	3552515	Of course, what the violation may be, or if it's per title, or per copy sold, oh, none of that was ever said.
3553135	3556356	I wish I knew more about what Take-Two kind of defended themselves with in this.
3557813	3558293	A machete.
3558694	3561716	I would have been like, listen, bitch, we didn't fucking put it in the game.
3562016	3563398	Some person hacked it in there.
3563758	3566540	Are you that goddamn dumb that you can't see this?
3566780	3569603	They're like, no, but games suck.
3569663	3571184	It was on the disc, Loki, though.
3571364	3572225	It was on the disc.
3572785	3573846	Just to be a devil's advocate.
3573866	3576088	And it was not accessible by normal means.
3577189	3577789	It was lazy.
3577969	3579991	Again, I go back to my old, it was lazy programming.
3580111	3581452	I don't even think it was so much lazy.
3581492	3584735	It happens in games all the time.
3584775	3587377	They took out the pointer and somebody put it back in with a hack code.
3588186	3590313	So dumb, it's so dumb!
3590333	3593883	On top of that, you have to do other stuff in addition to it, so...
3594968	3599370	It's ridiculous, and the fact that they're wasting our money investigating this?
3599931	3600951	I mean, for what?
3601391	3603292	Oh, to prove that this is a mature-rated game?
3603473	3610216	It's like saying, oh, well, this R-rated movie said it only had blood and violence, but I was totally shocked when I saw the boobies in there, too.
3610956	3613097	DJ PooEater over in chatroom says, What?
3613418	3613958	A breast?
3614338	3615799	This is an AO game now.
3616159	3618040	But the killing and use of the word nigga is cool.
3619099	3619600	Exactly.
3621262	3621822	It's stupid.
3621922	3626748	It's just, it's like the whole thing with movies and full frontal nudity when it comes to guys.
3627109	3634678	You know, it's okay in an R-rated movie, but when you get a naked guy in there, oh, NC-17, oh my god, horrible.
3635530	3638992	It's the same thing with this, you know, once you add a little bit of nudity in there.
3639392	3643734	And, which, you know, if you think about it... Actually, in the 70s, it wasn't a big deal at all.
3643774	3646735	Like, you go look at movies that were made in the 70s, like Porky's.
3646875	3647515	Life of Brian.
3647595	3650697	And there's Wang left and right in those movies, you know?
3650717	3651837	Well, what about... They were just art.
3651857	3656159	What about, like, God of War, where there's actual, you know, nudity in that.
3656679	3660241	And they had a sex game, and they're granted, they didn't show anything, but...
3660876	3667658	I mean, if you saw this game and actually played the hot coffee game or whatever, you would have been, this is ridiculous and stupid.
3667698	3668899	This is like a sex game.
3669279	3671500	It's about as ridiculous as Custard's Revenge.
3671560	3673500	I mean, it didn't really show anything.
3673540	3684484	It just showed some stupid, really low-res models dry-humping each other, basically, and a woman, you know, climaxing, I guess, when this meter got up.
3684544	3685965	I mean, it's ridiculous.
3686725	3687025	All right.
3688733	3693717	Let's continue moving on talking about video games and their reputation out there.
3694577	3695938	There's a columnist.
3696038	3697379	It's John Roseman.
3697399	3699240	He's a syndicated Christian columnist.
3699280	3701882	He's got 11 books on parenting.
3702282	3710228	He believes that collective common sense concerning children has been swamped by tidal waves of psychobabble that's lasted some 40 years now.
3710968	3715311	Anyway, he had a column that ran in Monday's edition of the Charlotte Observer.
3715351	3716272	Let me give you a quote from it.
3716932	3721715	When video games first came out, I warned my readers that they were not appropriate for children.
3722156	3724517	I maintained that they were not games, rather.
3724597	3726879	They produced stress and were addictive, literally.
3727299	3728860	It was not a popular stance.
3729801	3736465	He says, before entering into it, I told you so story about a mother and father dealing with introducing video games into their lives, their young children.
3736745	3738647	Here's some other gem quotes from the article here.
3739147	3744831	Quote, since then, hundreds of parents have shared with me their negative experiences with these nefarious devices.
3745211	3747332	The stories go in my I told you so file.
3747572	3751074	The following, written by the mother of several young children, is the latest edition.
3751434	3751894	Another quote.
3752414	3754755	When they played, there would be fighting and tears.
3754856	3758557	When the parents turned it off, the kids would mope around to complain of having nothing to do.
3758937	3763400	Were these the same children who pre-Xbox have never had a problem entertaining themselves?
3763920	3766401	Actually, they were not the same children at all.
3766701	3775786	They were beginning to exhibit addictive behavior, and as anyone who has ever lived with one will testify, an addict and the former non-addict are two entirely different people.
3777087	3778988	The story ends with a warning to all parents.
3779128	3782871	I firmly believe that video games are dangerous to children and families.
3782931	3783711	Do not buy one.
3783751	3784872	You cannot control it.
3785532	3786793	That's ridiculous.
3787438	3791742	First off, I love how this guy says, when video games first came out, I warned my readers.
3792082	3794925	So this guy was writing columns when Space War first came out?
3795025	3795385	Pong?
3795645	3798388	Yeah, so what, in the early 70s, late 60s?
3798528	3798988	Yeah.
3799709	3802351	You know, there were games well before that, too.
3802572	3804113	So what about board games, huh?
3804613	3805534	Are board games addictive?
3805755	3810519	Yeah, or when it rains outside and the children mope around because they can't go outside and play football?
3811078	3813020	Yeah, that's just how children are.
3814881	3817103	Say that you give them a sit and spin, right?
3817303	3817524	Right.
3817884	3818805	And then you take it away.
3818945	3820606	And the sit and spin was their favorite thing to do.
3821047	3822028	Well, how are they going to act?
3822368	3823128	They're going to cry.
3823148	3823749	They're going to be mopey.
3823769	3827392	If you've got multiple children and you've got a single thing, they're going to fight over it.
3827432	3829194	That's just how siblings are.
3829914	3834456	If a child's moping around that they have nothing to do, have them do the dishes or mop the floor.
3835617	3837738	That's what my mom made me do.
3838018	3840379	I never was to complain I have nothing to do.
3841260	3844201	My mom always said, if you tell me you have nothing to do, I'll find something for you to do.
3844261	3846362	I knew how to do laundry when I was six years old.
3846742	3848243	Don't give me this nothing to do crap.
3849263	3850844	You have children to do your housework for you.
3850964	3857806	Maybe if you didn't sit your kids in front of the TV and just have the TV raise them, and then when you take that away, then they don't have anything to do.
3858186	3862068	Maybe you should teach them, I don't know, to use their imagination or maybe play with toys.
3862468	3863948	My cousin was the same way.
3864448	3870550	You would give him Legos and he wouldn't know what to do with them because no one taught him how to play by himself or entertain himself.
3870630	3876512	Instead, they would have to entertain him by either putting a movie on or something like that.
3876552	3878173	He didn't have video games, but you know,
3878666	3879967	These are the same difference.
3880147	3880947	But it's the same thing.
3881047	3900274	It's basically, you don't teach your kids, because, oh my god, you know, having the kid and stuff was so much stress and stuff, and now we don't have time to ourselves, and oh, I'm just so tired with this, and now I need something to entertain my kids, and now they won't get along, and it's all this video game stuff, because they must have been addicted to it.
3900714	3902655	No, they're not addicted to the game.
3902775	3905176	They're just kids, and they whine, and
3905316	3906839	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
3919675	3928499	What I used to do with my little brothers, because my little brothers are about, the oldest of them is seven years younger than I am.
3930060	3935182	When my mom would be busy, I would teach them how to do something and say, okay, go do this.
3935582	3937503	And when I come back, I want to see what you've done.
3938083	3939564	I would break out the Lincoln Logs.
3939704	3941085	I had Lincoln Logs when I was a kid.
3941645	3942886	I break out the Lincoln Logs, come back.
3942906	3943586	I was Tinker Toy Kid.
3944487	3945207	We had Tinker Toys too.
3945848	3949550	My brothers would have built like a whole fort out of stuff because I showed them how to put them together.
3949810	3951591	We had the large size Tinker Toys.
3951651	3953632	The ones that were like ginormous.
3953712	3954733	Tinker Toy times 100.
3954833	3957475	I got to go to chat room because they have some great comments right now.
3957735	3962157	Legend of Zaku says, Sky, this guy is nothing more than the advocate of the American Taliban.
3962738	3964259	That's some harsh words, but okay.
3964999	3965840	It's your quote, not mine.
3966340	3967481	Let's see.
3967721	3969262	And then they start talking about board games.
3969422	3971223	The chat room is just going off on board games here.
3971544	3974071	Fireboma says Monopoly causes domestic violence.
3974572	3977139	Have you ever seen a family fight over a good old-fashioned game of Monopoly?
3977761	3978282	Uh-huh.
3980257	3987140	One of my friends' favorite stories that they always make me tell whenever we're drinking or whatever is the story about my mom and I fighting over the bag of M&M's.
3987740	3989981	I mean, you know, families fight over the dumbest shit.
3990101	3990662	They really do.
3991282	3991602	Let's see.
3991622	3992723	Siblings fight vicious.
3992803	3995264	Legend of Zaku says Frogger is animal cruelty.
3995724	3997605	GS191, think about the children.
3997665	3998305	Ban Connect 4.
3999946	4000326	Let's see.
4000606	4003568	Legend of Zaku says Mystery Date causes premarital sex.
4004738	4010141	Fireboma says life, you know, the game of life, causes kids to think that having children out of wedlock is okay.
4011601	4012862	So, get this.
4015163	4018525	Basically, toys are even more dangerous than video games, I think.
4018605	4021746	You know, Linkin Logs, they make great catapults.
4022367	4025728	And, you know, those... What was it?
4025968	4028790	Not K'nex, but... Oh, God.
4028830	4029630	I used to make... Tinker Toys?
4030030	4031351	No, not Tinker Toys.
4031391	4033532	Well, we have the life-size Tinker Toys, and those things were...
4036001	4043606	I remember flicking the little circular knob off of the stick when you pull it back and then flick it off the stick and I used to hit my brother in the head with that all the time.
4043626	4044807	I think that's why he's a marine now.
4044827	4048729	If you think the video games are dangerous, try dealing with a kid with a crossbow.
4056850	4057351	Let's see here.
4057511	4059012	I think this comment is really good, too.
4059032	4060573	I wanted to share this so we can move on here.
4060853	4069099	Blaze in our chatroom says, I'm a devout Christian, and I hate these people who are on a useless crusade to try and reform society through their political bullshit.
4071121	4071401	Amen.
4072962	4073302	All right.
4073903	4075364	That wasn't a pun, by the way.
4075484	4076044	I know, I know.
4076925	4079307	We've had these very strange puns come out of nowhere tonight.
4079447	4081989	Don't make daddy taught daughters to sneak out at night.
4082849	4084711	I need a game to teach me how to sneak out of the house.
4085737	4087258	What did the game Cootie teach us?
4087298	4087999	That's what I want to know.
4088179	4088959	How to play with bugs.
4109267	4109788	DarkSakura.com
4132441	4140464	I've been doing a lot of research into food and eating, given that I've been looking for natural treatments for the chronic fatigue immunodeficiency syndrome.
4160340	4182710	which I try not to go off on that one but I've been trying to do a lot of natural you know research into how to naturally treat it and they're basically stating that a lot of the the ideals that were taught as children by our parents who of course learn this from their parents learn it from their parents are you know not necessarily the best thing to actually do
4183211	4186072	You know, you're taught to clean your plate no matter how full you are.
4186452	4188954	So as you grow up, you're taught to overeat.
4189314	4192035	When you are full, you're done, not when you're satisfied.
4192775	4205221	And I think that a lot of that, plus a lot of, you know, a lot of the different, you know, technology we have now that basically promotes being lazy, you know, a lot of easy food, things that are packed full of calories and bad for you.
4205721	4210463	Basically, our society is built around a very, very vicious relationship with food.
4211323	4216025	And so, I personally am trying to go into breaking some of those habits of myself.
4216466	4220968	But I encourage, you know, parents, when your child says they're full, don't make them eat anymore.
4222029	4222769	Start with them young.
4223269	4224850	You know, teach them how to go out and play.
4225510	4226611	Teach them how to eat right.
4227091	4231253	Don't make them clean their plate, because if they're satisfied, there's no need to stuff them.
4232334	4233094	That's what I have to say.
4234035	4234775	Loki, ref you.
4235195	4237517	Uh, fuck you to think I... Yeah!
4237537	4238017	Yeah!
4238632	4239712	You got pink eye this week?
4240332	4241012	Yeah, I guess so.
4242073	4247774	Well, conjunctivitis, but they basically said that's pink eye, but I guess it's just it sucks.
4247834	4248874	Isn't it really conjunctivitis?
4249294	4249754	Yeah, it is.
4252134	4253455	I'm throwing it towards you.
4255175	4255635	Okay, anyway.
4256435	4259296	No, I think it's just conjunctivitis or whatever.
4261096	4263336	That sucks, seeing his eyes all red.
4263356	4264637	It doesn't hurt, though, so that's kind of good.
4264657	4267377	It's just really annoying having your eye water all day.
4268748	4270409	Um, yeah, that's about it.
4271329	4277150	Alright, uh, my FU of the week goes to my sinus issues or whatever, because you guys were listening to last week's show, I was sick.
4277230	4281331	I still, I feel, it's something about the weekends are making me sick lately, because I'm sick again.
4281431	4286213	Like, I woke up this morning feeling all, you know, congesty and stuff, and it sucks.
4286273	4286993	I hate being sick.
4287033	4287493	Go away.
4287733	4289674	I'm not supposed to have allergies and sinus problems.
4289714	4290154	You suck.
4291254	4292374	You're making me sleep too much.
4294375	4294755	Alright.
4295737	4296998	That was our angst for the week.
4297078	4298819	Let's get back into some gaming news.
4299039	4303921	And we'll go over to DarkSakura, as you know she likes to keep an eye on what's going on overseas.
4304142	4305682	And what is going on overseas?
4306303	4307063	A bunch of stuff.
4308424	4308924	No, seriously.
4310205	4314407	There's actually some UK gaming events going on.
4314907	4319330	So I thought that it's a good idea for our overseas listeners.
4320270	4323472	You know, we like to make sure that they stay in touch, so...
4324422	4330248	Um, there's the Women in Games UK at the University of Teesside, uh, 10th through 11th in July.
4331229	4340538	Um, it's, uh, 50 pounds for students, 100 pounds for, uh, non-students, and then after, uh, July 14th, it's 75 pounds for students and 150 for non-students.
4341199	4346144	Um, sex and games, panel on, uh, hiring, retaining next-gen positions, that type of thing.
4346805	4347085	Heh heh.
4347884	4350546	Develop Conference Brighton, 11th through 13th in July.
4351087	4351447	It's free.
4353129	4363198	That's the conference before the 10th, then in June it's 435 pounds and 570 after that.
4363298	4370625	There's going to be people from Bungie hanging out there, different lectures, different
4371559	4373702	information on DirectX10.
4374603	4378086	Then there's the games edu conference in Brighton the 14th of July.
4380529	4382672	It's going to be up to the 10th of June.
4382712	4386997	It'll be 95 pounds, 110 after 10th June.
4388258	4390741	Basically it's going to be game design, academics,
4391670	4393210	furthering the UK talent pool.
4393591	4403833	There's the Edinburgh Interactive Entertainment Festival, which is the 21st through 22nd of August, which is game screening, award ceremonies, and game ratings.
4403973	4404614	That's going to be fun.
4405794	4408755	Games Market Europe in London, 6th through 17th September.
4410995	4414456	There's also going to be some playable titles there, networking opportunities.
4414616	4420358	GDC London, the 3rd through 4th October, and no information yet.
4421004	4422968	There should be more information coming later in June.
4425834	4426114	All right.
4426936	4428920	And if any of you guys go to this, let us know how it is.
4429902	4430263	Sounds good.
4430283	4430884	We'd love to write it.
4431977	4434218	All right, let's go over to Loki, who has news.
4434238	4436278	You know, there's all these tycoon games.
4436298	4444941	There's, what, Railroad Tycoon, of course, and there was, let's see, the Amusement Park one, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Lemonade Tycoon.
4445181	4446301	There's all these games.
4446381	4449682	But this might be one I actually want to check out, Loki, right?
4449822	4450142	Yes.
4450783	4452243	They've announced Hell Tycoon.
4452773	4455255	And of course, announced it on Tuesday, which was June 6, 2006.
4455676	4457558	Are you sure this wasn't a joke?
4458018	4458478	Nope.
4458498	4462582	The official website is up right now, and you can go check it out, of course.
4463083	4466306	And of course, it should be interesting.
4466526	4468167	It's healthhycoon.com, obviously.
4468788	4475715	And basically, you have to manage the misery of others and make sure that...
4478634	4480337	I so will play this game.
4480437	4481418	I'm going to the site right now.
4481438	4482520	This site has noise, right?
4482620	4483281	Yes, it does.
4483341	4486787	Okay, you guys might hear this come up on the screen, but I have to see this for myself.
4487548	4489771	Yeah, but it's pretty awesome.
4489831	4490733	Loading, loading, loading.
4490773	4491113	Let's see.
4491133	4491173	Oh.
4493024	4493765	Oh my gosh.
4494565	4495125	Evil noises.
4495225	4499828	Basically, it says, When Armageddon comes, the demon armies of hells will be defeated.
4500148	4501109	This can only mean one thing.
4501149	4502549	The devil isn't doing his job.
4502650	4504050	You are the new ruler of hell.
4504471	4509753	Your job is to keep Abyss stocked with torqued souls, reform all nine planes of hell with fire and brimstone.
4510154	4511835	On Judgment Day, will you be ready?
4512035	4515997	Of course, it's no secret that politicians are controlled by the devil.
4516077	4518919	Now you know why Washington, D.C.
4518979	4521160	is built around a giant pentagram.
4522494	4523634	This scene just goes on and on.
4524755	4527495	It's funny, so go check it out.
4527855	4529976	We need to get the makers of Hell Tycoon on this program.
4529996	4532196	I want to talk to them and find out what's wrong with them.
4532236	4535057	I mean, seriously, how messed up do you have to be to think of something like this?
4536717	4537317	That's awesome.
4537897	4540078	That actually sounds kind of smart.
4541158	4542818	I'm going to check this out, I think, when it comes out.
4543519	4543839	Let's see.
4543899	4547299	We have Dartetsuya says, sounds like Loki's kind of game, actually.
4547960	4549660	Bob Dole says, that sounds awesome.
4550700	4553361	HitStun wants to know, does anybody own the Tycoon name?
4553721	4556641	I guess not, because you see all these Tycoon games, like, all the time.
4557281	4561782	And JeremyTodd1 made the mandatory joke, I suppose, beating this joke into the ground.
4562323	4563963	Giant Enemy Crab cartoon.
4564323	4564823	Or Tycoon.
4566503	4569104	Journey Tycoon, where you manage the band journey.
4569324	4577746	Speaking of a joke that never gets old, Uwe Boll has sued the distributor of Blood Rain.
4578792	4579453	Thanks for watching!
4595945	4604690	refusing to pay the producers their share of the gross proceeds and not using the $10 million that Bull's production company had given them for promotion and advertising of the film.
4605771	4610914	This suit has been confirmed that it is going on there, but who knows what will actually happen with that.
4610974	4611334	Let's see.
4611614	4614436	I'm trying to look for a comment here.
4614456	4616037	They did comment and basically...
4616690	4617791	Yeah, that was all bullshit.
4617931	4618291	Oh, let's see.
4618351	4621552	Romar Entertainment co-founder Jane Schramm had a comment here.
4621973	4625534	He had such bad publicity that I felt bad and I wanted to help him out.
4625835	4627255	We made no money on this movie.
4627375	4627716	Nothing.
4627776	4628296	We lost.
4628336	4629877	This was a complete financial loss.
4629917	4632838	And he has the audacity to remove us off the credits.
4633058	4634439	Yeah, that was the thing.
4634519	4637400	When the DVD came out, they removed them off the credits.
4638061	4638841	Interesting.
4638961	4644544	And they made it look like it was distributed by Uwe Boll instead of Romar.
4645572	4647293	So, yeah, he's a jackass.
4649855	4652237	I wouldn't have known because there's no way I'm going to watch that DVD.
4653117	4653417	All right.
4653477	4655118	Anyway, we're going to go ahead and take a break.
4655158	4658080	And when we come back, there'll be plenty more Orange Lounge Radio where this came from.
4658180	4659181	So we'll see you in a little bit.
4659581	4664545	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4665005	4669328	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
