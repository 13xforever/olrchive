00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Anyway, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 188 for this June the 25th of 2006.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.440
We're here, we're going to get back into the news very shortly here, however, I wanted

00:31.440 --> 00:36.080
to grill our special guest in studio, 23rd Magus, here for just a minute here about something

00:36.080 --> 00:38.360
he had told me about on break.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.440
You were talking about World of Warcraft, right?

00:40.440 --> 00:41.440
Yes.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.560
And you were talking about the add-ons for World of Warcraft.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.560
Yes.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.820
Now, there was one that I thought was very interesting that you said you had installed

00:48.820 --> 00:50.800
that messes with the chat somehow?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.320
I've never heard of this, this sounds great.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.840
Yes, it's an add-on called Eloquence.

00:54.840 --> 01:00.380
It's a chat filter, I refer to it as a sanity filter, for the grammar freaks out there who

01:00.380 --> 01:07.380
are tired of the noob speak, the dude speak, the lead speak, or just plain dumb speak.

01:08.440 --> 01:14.140
Basically it filters through whatever comes through your chat and parses it so it's all

01:14.140 --> 01:20.300
capitalized and punctuated and it translates the abbreviations for you. For the roleplay

01:20.300 --> 01:29.920
it'll even apply basic roleplay things to it, or even apply a dialect, and there's similar

01:29.920 --> 01:35.540
chat add-ons out there, I mentioned my FUs about the LFG channel, there's a filter out

01:35.540 --> 01:42.700
there that will filter out anything that's not related to looking for group comments.

01:42.700 --> 01:51.540
And most of the add-ons for the WoW players you can go to ui.worldofwar.net or curse-gaming.com

01:51.540 --> 01:54.440
and pick up some add-ons to kind of enhance your play experience.

01:54.440 --> 02:00.260
So this filter basically forces noobs, in other words by the time it reaches your computer

02:00.260 --> 02:02.340
screen, to be using correct spelling and punctuation.

02:02.340 --> 02:05.320
Yes, it makes people sound smarter than they are.

02:05.320 --> 02:08.540
Whoever wrote this should win a humanitarian award, seriously.

02:08.540 --> 02:10.220
I should nominate him for one.

02:10.220 --> 02:13.740
I think we should nominate this person for a Nobel Peace Prize.

02:13.740 --> 02:16.340
Don't you think we ought to install something like this, DarkSakura?

02:16.340 --> 02:17.340
God.

02:17.340 --> 02:18.340
That's great.

02:18.340 --> 02:23.140
Except for the times where you do it as a joke when it's funny.

02:23.140 --> 02:31.140
Still, I love good grammar, and I like to see good grammar when I'm about in my MMOs.

02:31.140 --> 02:34.500
Maybe something like that for Ragnarok.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.500
Beautiful thought.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.500
Eel, please.

02:36.500 --> 02:41.360
I just wanted you to be able to share that with our listeners because I bet I didn't know about that

02:41.360 --> 02:46.560
But I'm only a casual World of Warcraft player. I'm not you know hardcore casuals casual Rob

02:47.320 --> 02:53.200
Yeah, yeah, or what are you trying to say? I'm just in other words. I casual casual who has never even hit 60

02:53.600 --> 02:58.240
No, I haven't, but that's you know. I don't I don't play to hit 60. I play for fun

02:58.240 --> 03:05.520
I had 60 someday, but you'll have more. I don't profess to be some World of Warcraft expert. Okay. I've got zillions of other games

03:05.520 --> 03:09.120
I'm trying to play too all right anyway moving on

03:11.040 --> 03:18.680
Some news out of Nintendo this week some power players over at Nintendo namely Iwata and Miyamoto have been discussing the Wii the

03:18.720 --> 03:23.600
Nintendo DS and more and there's a full in-depth article over on gamasutra.com

03:23.600 --> 03:26.480
I thought maybe I'd pull some choice quotes out of here

03:26.480 --> 03:32.960
Iwata talked about the GameCube launch when we launched GameCube the initial sales were good and all the hardware was

03:32.960 --> 03:35.640
manufactured at the time we were sold through.

03:35.640 --> 03:45.800
However, at this period, we could not provide the market with strong software titles in

03:45.800 --> 03:47.200
a timely fashion.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.840
As a result, we could not leverage the initial launch time momentum, and sales of GameCube

03:51.840 --> 03:53.000
slowed down.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.200
To avoid repeating this with Wii, we have been intensifying the software development,

03:57.200 --> 04:02.140
both internally at Nintendo and at developers outside the company, in order to prepare aggressive

04:02.140 --> 04:05.260
software lineup for Wii and after the launch.

04:05.260 --> 04:08.300
So it kind of sounds like they're learning from some of the mistakes they made with the

04:08.300 --> 04:12.260
GameCube, which was namely kind of a dead period, which kind of happened with the DS

04:12.260 --> 04:13.260
too, didn't it?

04:13.260 --> 04:17.740
But I remember for a couple months after the DS came out, even on this show, because we

04:17.740 --> 04:21.380
were up and running by the time the DS was out, and I remember earlier episodes of this

04:21.380 --> 04:25.140
program during that lull, we were kind of like, come on Nintendo, where's our games?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.420
Ping Pals ain't gonna cut it, come on!

04:27.420 --> 04:28.700
And suddenly, boom!

04:28.700 --> 04:29.700
Hit games.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.560
like just one hit game after another.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.720
Miyamoto, I'm sure you guys want to know what he said.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.720
Here's a quote from Miyamoto.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.160
While I feel that we need more internal software development resources at Nintendo, we have

04:40.160 --> 04:42.160
not increased the number greatly.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.100
When we combine the total number of people working for Nintendo's first party and second

04:46.100 --> 04:52.680
party titles, however, there are far more than 1,500 people working on the titles today.

04:52.680 --> 04:57.720
Very interesting, some quotes there from the main men themselves that they're trying to

04:57.720 --> 05:01.560
learn from their mistakes with the GameCube and go forth with that so

05:01.560 --> 05:06.140
I applaud folks that can look at that in perspective and say okay what can we do

05:06.140 --> 05:07.280
better next time

05:07.280 --> 05:11.360
definitely and in fact things that

05:11.360 --> 05:15.040
you know you can do better next time or actually

05:15.040 --> 05:19.920
Jamie you had something? I was just saying it's good business sense. That's what any business

05:19.920 --> 05:20.600
needs to

05:20.600 --> 05:24.600
to progress is learn from their mistakes. Yeah and you can't just assume that the

05:24.600 --> 05:27.600
business is going to be there no matter what and I will

05:27.600 --> 05:32.040
I will not name any companies here who seem to be guilty of making that mistake recently,

05:32.040 --> 05:36.840
but it's four letters, starts with an S, ends with Oni.

05:36.840 --> 05:45.840
Speaking of progressive thinking, the brand new Macbook, basically running off of some

05:45.840 --> 05:52.960
really crappy integrated graphics chip that is unable to run most games, well, fear not,

05:52.960 --> 05:57.000
at least you can use it sort of like the Wii.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.280
the accelerometer that's built into it that's basically designed to detect that the computer's

06:02.280 --> 06:10.500
falling and stop the hard drive so that it doesn't ruin any of your data. Well, a clever

06:10.500 --> 06:19.520
gamer has actually used this program called the AMS2HID, which is used with this program

06:19.520 --> 06:26.520
a Neverball, to basically make the modern day equivalent of a wooden labyrinth. So,

06:26.900 --> 06:33.620
by tilting your computer you can use it to control games. Crappy games, yes, but you

06:33.620 --> 06:37.240
can control games. I knew you would not be able to get through that story without taking

06:37.240 --> 06:43.220
a swing. I'm sorry, it can't run anything! It says right in the article here, it's using

06:43.220 --> 06:48.180
this basically this integrated you know graphics chip that's designed by Apple

06:48.180 --> 06:53.740
and it doesn't run anything because it's not you know ATI or Nvidia compliance so

06:53.740 --> 06:59.460
I'm sorry it's the way it is so you don't buy it for games big deal but if

06:59.460 --> 07:03.620
you do you know you can play at least this game by tilting the computer which

07:03.620 --> 07:10.620
I'm sure is gonna be oh so comfortable they are really light yeah at least it's

07:10.620 --> 07:14.780
It's an Apple, those are light computers compared to some of these monsters, other ones I've

07:14.780 --> 07:15.780
used.

07:15.780 --> 07:17.780
ATI chip in this one.

07:17.780 --> 07:23.580
Yeah, look, I do think it's a silly idea, but you know, whatever, some guy's bored and

07:23.580 --> 07:30.800
wants to do Labyrinth, whatever, but I don't really see it being the next trend in gaming.

07:30.800 --> 07:37.700
This is more one of those, you know, isn't that funny stories to me.

07:37.700 --> 07:43.540
I don't know, I mean if you, it's just like was it like that stupid game that they had

07:43.540 --> 07:53.540
with Windows 98, that like bumper car game thing that came with, yeah that sucked too.

07:53.540 --> 08:01.020
None of the games made by like Microsoft or Apple that come with their systems, granted

08:01.020 --> 08:04.140
they're not supposed to be that great, just they all suck.

08:04.140 --> 08:08.300
I mean, you can't really innovate on solitaire.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.500
I don't know.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.740
Kiss my ass, Chip's challenged with the shit.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.860
Didn't come with it, you had to buy it separately.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.120
Alright, anyway.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.540
We were talking about Wii-type technology there a little bit.

08:22.540 --> 08:26.620
But what is really coming to the Wii? Perhaps some new trademarks registered

08:26.620 --> 08:28.940
by Nintendo of Japan give some hints.

08:28.940 --> 08:32.360
Wii Culture was something that was recently trademarked by them.

08:32.360 --> 08:36.320
Wii pointer which kinda sounds like it might be the name of the

08:36.320 --> 08:39.720
what we've been calling the Wii mode or the rev mode or was that what you were calling it?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.680
What were you calling it DarkSocker? I've always been calling it the Wii Mote.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.600
The Wii Con. You were calling it the Wii Con.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.480
Well it sounds like the official name is probably going to be the Wii Pointer because I don't know what else

08:49.480 --> 08:53.360
that could be. Also they've registered

08:53.360 --> 08:56.840
exclamation point exclamation point M

08:56.840 --> 09:01.720
and you can actually look that up online if you want to see that trademark for

09:01.720 --> 09:07.320
yourself it seems like exclamation exclamation M could be some type of

09:07.320 --> 09:12.080
instant messaging because that kind of looks like I am when you look at it

09:12.080 --> 09:16.280
however we don't know you know anything 100% for sure until the system actually

09:16.280 --> 09:21.840
comes out so we shall see but we like to speculate based on what's going on

09:21.840 --> 09:26.680
behind the instant messenger do you know is it was that announced for sure oh I'm

09:26.680 --> 09:33.680
making that up. Nintendo Media 64 is pointing out that it's Wii upside down. Yeah, we figured

09:35.540 --> 09:41.140
that one out. Yeah, and that's a cutesy thing to do, which would make sense for Nintendo,

09:41.140 --> 09:48.140
but we'll find out. Yeah. Well, I don't know, it could be instant messaging, but who knows.

09:48.140 --> 09:54.580
instant messaging, but who knows. One thing though that Nintendo does have in store at

09:54.580 --> 09:59.320
least is the fact that their controller actually vibrates and it is wireless so that's one

09:59.320 --> 10:06.320
step ahead of Sony, but of course immersion says that they're wondering now if Nintendo

10:07.660 --> 10:13.680
copied them and that there could possibly be a lawsuit against Nintendo. We know for

10:13.680 --> 10:19.040
For a fact, you know, of course Microsoft actually licenses the immersion technology

10:19.040 --> 10:24.480
or whatever. I don't know, I can't believe that they're the first company to think of

10:24.480 --> 10:31.140
rumbling controllers. But, I don't know, they're basically going to keep a close eye on the

10:31.140 --> 10:35.400
Wii to see if the technology is the same and if they can make some money off of it.

10:35.400 --> 10:41.200
So what is it? We've got our eye on you. We've got our eye on you! We're the only one that

10:41.200 --> 10:46.180
could get to work so obviously you copied us I mean that's basically what

10:46.180 --> 10:50.260
it's you know backwards thinking I'm starting to wonder about these guys it's

10:50.260 --> 10:53.500
kind of interesting I don't like I don't like them and what was they have why

10:53.500 --> 10:58.000
just because of this I just don't like immersion I don't know why you know you

10:58.000 --> 11:02.300
got to tell me why why don't I like them because they're basically trying to

11:02.300 --> 11:06.980
profit off of all this stuff granted you know they're trying to you know sue for

11:06.980 --> 11:10.300
why didn't they sue them back in the day when they have the rumble pack or

11:10.300 --> 11:15.280
or something like that. Why didn't they sue back when, you know, the original PlayStation

11:15.280 --> 11:20.680
came out originally? Why sue now is my question.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.200
Well, I don't know. It just seems kind of funny because it seems like when we talked

11:23.200 --> 11:27.040
about this with Sony, it was funny. But now that's going on with Nintendo, it's like,

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
oh no, you didn't.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.560
No, it's still funny. And I still think it's funny, you know, because, you know, I'm sure

11:31.560 --> 11:36.400
that they're going to try to do a lawsuit for it. But here's my thing. It would be like

11:36.400 --> 11:41.840
If I came up with the technology for LCD screens and now I go back and say, I'm gonna sue all

11:41.840 --> 11:42.840
you people!

11:42.840 --> 11:47.680
I mean that's basically what it is, isn't it a little late to be doing that?

11:47.680 --> 11:49.720
I don't know, that's what it seems like to me.

11:49.720 --> 11:55.520
It's like, well if you're so concerned about your technology and your patents, why weren't

11:55.520 --> 11:59.720
you trying to protect them for the last few years?

11:59.720 --> 12:00.760
What's wrong with that?

12:00.760 --> 12:04.880
Don't tell me you didn't realize that Sony had controllers that rumbled because that's

12:04.880 --> 12:05.880
ridiculous.

12:05.880 --> 12:09.080
Holy Mania has an interesting perspective on this in our chat room.

12:09.080 --> 12:14.040
When capitalism no longer works, you sue.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.040
Interesting perspective.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.200
Yeah.

12:19.200 --> 12:27.760
Excuse me, I had a something caught in my throat.

12:27.760 --> 12:28.760
Hairball?

12:28.760 --> 12:29.760
Yeah, hairball.

12:29.760 --> 12:36.760
You know, with as much hair as I managed to brush off the cat last night, I wouldn't be surprised.

12:36.760 --> 12:48.760
Anyway, um, well, you know how Sony was saying, you know, the, uh, PS3 is a computer, the PS3 is a computer, blah blah blah, they were saying about the PS2?

12:48.760 --> 12:51.760
Yeah, you brought this up a couple weeks ago, yeah, about the computer thing with the PS3.

12:51.760 --> 13:03.760
Well, basically, the UK Court of Appeals has said that the PlayStation 2 is not a computer.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.760
They basically pretty much laughed at Sony.

13:07.760 --> 13:14.760
Lord Justice C. Chadwick said that Sony's skeleton argument was, to quote,

13:14.760 --> 13:22.800
to quote beyond what can be regarded as acceptable written advocacy so Sony got

13:22.800 --> 13:29.480
uh got pwned they got served interesting so what does this mean those tax breaks

13:29.480 --> 13:32.560
that we're looking forward to may not happen yep pretty much the UK Court of

13:32.560 --> 13:36.720
Appeals also denied Sony any right to bring the case to the European Court of

13:36.720 --> 13:41.600
Justice the other thing that should note is it doesn't matter anyways if the ps3

13:41.600 --> 13:51.160
3 is considered a computer and not because those taxes on electronics are gone now. So,

13:51.160 --> 13:58.440
it wouldn't matter if it's, you know, categorized as a game console, as a PC, as a vibrator,

13:58.440 --> 14:06.640
it doesn't matter. It's still going to be tax free. So, I don't know. I think any way

14:06.640 --> 14:13.340
to make more money it seems like nowadays it's just I don't know very desperate very

14:13.340 --> 14:23.460
crazy crazy like Kojima and his comparisons to steak yes what may I be talking about well

14:23.460 --> 14:31.520
actually Kojima was comparing the consoles to a steak dinner and like DVDs so I don't

14:31.520 --> 14:35.800
know that's kind of a strange comparison when you think about it but I thought it was funny

14:35.800 --> 14:37.800
So I'm going to read them for you.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.800
So for example, PlayStation 3.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.800
If the game creators and users want to have a great steak for their anniversary,

14:45.800 --> 14:48.800
they maybe go to the PS3.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.800
And then of course for the 360, if they want a great steak dinner,

14:53.800 --> 14:57.800
a great steak with their family, a little bit more casual during the weekends,

14:57.800 --> 14:59.800
they might select the 360.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.800
I don't understand how these comparisons of steak work, but whatever.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.640
whatever and then of course then to the we why not have a great stake at your

15:06.640 --> 15:08.240
house every day and then

15:08.240 --> 15:13.600
might shoes the we does that make any sense to you

15:13.600 --> 15:17.480
because it is making sense to me I you know usually see a centric people that

15:17.480 --> 15:19.680
are making these comparisons to a

15:19.680 --> 15:24.960
the food and other things that I don't know it's a very strange to pay me make

15:24.960 --> 15:26.520
yes when he was talking about movies

15:26.520 --> 15:31.240
PlayStation 3 is like a movie theater for people who want to see this movie

15:31.240 --> 15:34.540
on a big screen with THX and 5.1 audio

15:34.540 --> 15:38.640
even if they have to pay a high price. Whereas the 360

15:38.640 --> 15:41.860
the 360 is like a DVD. Basically you don't know

15:41.860 --> 15:46.300
what movie you want to see so you go to the store and see if you can pick up a

15:46.300 --> 15:47.060
good one.

15:47.060 --> 15:50.500
Which I don't understand. And then the Wii

15:50.500 --> 15:54.580
is like a TV for when you're home. You don't know

15:54.580 --> 15:58.500
what you want to watch but you want to have that variety.

15:58.500 --> 16:10.580
Well, one of the best people I got to meet at E3, Igarashi Koji, has actually made some

16:10.580 --> 16:17.700
comments about the PlayStation 3 at E3, and he's quoted as saying, maybe it's too expensive.

16:17.700 --> 16:23.360
But he did actually have an interview with Game Informer talking about Microsoft and

16:23.360 --> 16:29.520
said he wasn't really negative about Microsoft, but to quote, for some reason they tend to

16:29.520 --> 16:33.740
back off a little when it comes to something really foreign, but if Japanese developers

16:33.740 --> 16:37.400
would say they're working on Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest or Metal Gear maybe, then

16:37.400 --> 16:41.720
I guess Japanese consumers would take it seriously and consider purchasing it.

16:41.720 --> 16:50.120
He's also stated that as far as the new Castlevania games going for Portrait of Ruin, the next

16:50.120 --> 16:55.720
installment after Dawn of Sorrow would it might feature unlockable co-op

16:55.720 --> 16:59.740
missions to be played over Wi-Fi but that's not confirmed actually he's

16:59.740 --> 17:02.360
quoted as saying it's not confirmed because he hasn't started working on it

17:02.360 --> 17:08.320
so he's thinking that it would be something unlockable it was also

17:08.320 --> 17:18.640
mentioned that that basically there's going to be the two screen display for

17:18.640 --> 17:25.800
portrait of ruin again for the for the DS different closeable items in there

17:25.800 --> 17:29.960
but it's not stated whether or not it's going to be skills and items rather than

17:29.960 --> 17:39.320
souls so sad to say but there was the potential about possibly working on the

17:39.320 --> 17:43.000
PlayStation 3 in the Xbox 360 also come up in that interview I'm sure many

17:43.000 --> 17:46.520
folks would be very much looking forward to a Castlevania on the PlayStation 3

17:46.520 --> 17:48.480
I just love his reaction.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.320
Yeah.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.080
Perhaps it's a bit too expensive.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.540
Anyway, another game that people are really looking forward to

17:55.540 --> 17:57.360
is Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.160
And there's a new rumor floating around.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.660
It started at gonintendo.com that Ubisoft

18:02.660 --> 18:04.800
is going to be getting into the game there

18:04.800 --> 18:06.200
with some of their characters.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.620
And if you think about what that would bring to the table,

18:08.620 --> 18:12.280
that could be Jade from Beyond Good and Evil, Rayman,

18:12.280 --> 18:14.560
Sam Fisher, which would be an interesting counterpart

18:14.560 --> 18:16.160
to Solid Snake if you think about it,

18:16.160 --> 18:25.660
And the Prince, from Prince of Persia, which I think, probably from that list, Rayman and the Prince would seem most likely, especially Rayman, that would be an interesting addition, yeah, I could see that.

18:27.360 --> 18:40.660
So that was developer Mashihiro Sakurai saying that other third-party characters would be a definite possibility, and GoNintendo.com, I suppose, is speculating that Ubisoft is possibly the other third-party being involved there.

18:40.660 --> 18:44.860
You know what would be cool though if they did it, since they're releasing Rave Man's

18:44.860 --> 18:47.860
Raving Rabbits, have the rabbits as one of the characters.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.340
You just want to kill bunnies.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.260
I just, I think they're funny.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.260
That's what it is.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.260
You just want to murder bunnies.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.260
I know how you are.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.260
Cute animals need to die.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.260
Alright.

18:56.260 --> 19:02.020
And of course, you know, every time we bring up Super Smash Bros. Brawl, folks in the chat

19:02.020 --> 19:04.980
room start talking about what characters they want to see in it.

19:04.980 --> 19:08.060
Yuri Lever talking about Katamari.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.820
That would be an interesting third party thing.

19:09.820 --> 19:14.020
Well, the only thing about that is they've said they haven't been on the system already,

19:14.020 --> 19:15.220
so probably not.

19:15.220 --> 19:21.260
Poo Eater says the Jet Set guy he could spray your face, but again, also not on any Nintendo

19:21.260 --> 19:22.260
system.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.260
I still say Sonic.

19:23.260 --> 19:26.900
I think Sonic and Bonk are actually the ones I'm thinking.

19:26.900 --> 19:32.540
Oh, that's a good point, especially with the recent Genesis and TurboGrafx love, thanks

19:32.540 --> 19:33.540
to the Virtual Console.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.540
That's a brilliant idea.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.540
I hope it happens.

19:36.540 --> 19:40.540
Anyway, DarkSakura.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.540
We get letters once in a while, right?

19:42.540 --> 19:43.540
Oh, really?

19:43.540 --> 19:45.540
Yes, they send them to mailbag at orangelandradio.com.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.540
Real quick last thought, sorry.

19:47.540 --> 19:49.540
Nestor and Howard.

19:49.540 --> 19:50.540
Stop it.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.540
That's a little too old school for most people, I think.

19:52.540 --> 19:53.540
All right, anyway.

19:53.540 --> 19:56.540
Dude, I remember Nestor and Howard.

19:56.540 --> 19:57.540
I do too.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.540
Especially the Mega Man one that went on for like three issues.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.540
That one was great.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.540
Do we ever get emails about Nestor and Howard?

20:03.540 --> 20:04.540
No.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.540
We should.

20:05.540 --> 20:08.500
us their favorite memories well dark soccer tell us about what they're

20:08.500 --> 20:20.020
emailing us about at mailbag at orange launcher calm this week our listeners

20:20.020 --> 20:24.980
are very emo okay I'm gonna start from the beginning I got one from DJ ratchet

20:24.980 --> 20:29.540
who's been on our boards for quite a while just to go ahead and read this I've

20:29.540 --> 20:32.140
been behind on your podcast I've been listening to a few of the slightly older

20:32.140 --> 20:36.140
I have a few responses to some of the things said.

20:36.140 --> 20:40.140
Number one, congrats on Loki for getting married even though everyone said it a hundred times.

20:40.140 --> 20:46.140
It's not just OLR with the Sony hate, pretty much every other podcast I've listened to has nothing but bad things to say about Sony.

20:46.140 --> 20:51.140
At least you guys are trying to be fair, others are being real fanboyish about the whole thing.

20:51.140 --> 20:54.140
I'm one of the suckers who are going to get a PS3 though.

20:54.140 --> 21:00.140
I'm trying guys, I'm really trying to be devil's advocate when it comes to Sony, but guys it's tough.

21:00.140 --> 21:04.620
And even the Sony fanboys have to recognize right now the odds are not in your favor. I'm sorry

21:04.620 --> 21:10.520
The system is only as good as the games on it. E3 was not a good setup for Sony fanboys. I'm sorry

21:10.520 --> 21:12.260
We'll do what we can the rest of the year

21:12.260 --> 21:18.700
Maybe Sony will throw us a few frickin bones before Christmas, but or the launch of the system really, but they had cool commercials though

21:19.100 --> 21:25.060
Yeah, I guess there's something today. They will if they get Castlevania. That's a huge plus to return to the email

21:25.060 --> 21:30.060
Harmonics does need to make another amplitude frequency game. I'm still hooked to those games.

21:30.060 --> 21:35.060
Guitar Hero looks like amplitude with a guitar peripheral and nothing else. That's the reason I have not bought Guitar Hero.

21:35.060 --> 21:41.060
Quick question. Is Space Channel 5 Special Edition for the PS2 a straight port of the Dreamcast version? I'm considering buying it.

21:41.060 --> 21:48.060
To answer the question, actually it's both. It's Space Channel 5 2 and the Dreamcast one.

21:48.060 --> 21:53.060
I own it. I have not played it yet because I have the Japanese Space Channel 5 2.

21:53.060 --> 21:56.500
but I do know that it's supposed to include both games. I've played it.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.980
I've played the Japanese version actually, randomly enough, and

21:59.980 --> 22:04.740
it is pretty much a direct port, but if you have not played Space Channel 5,

22:04.740 --> 22:08.920
you must have this game. Especially if you're a music game fan, which I'm

22:08.920 --> 22:11.360
guessing if you have DJ in your nickname, you probably are,

22:11.360 --> 22:15.600
you really want to pick up this game. And also DJ Ratchet, thank you for the well

22:15.600 --> 22:16.060
wish.

22:16.060 --> 22:21.040
Actually, another thing that he wanted to add is that his mother, who knows

22:21.040 --> 22:24.280
there's nothing about video games thinks that the Blu-ray is the biggest rip-off in the world.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.920
Well the players are like, I don't know,

22:27.920 --> 22:32.520
$700 or something right? Oh that was something I saw this week is I saw an HD DVD

22:32.520 --> 22:36.400
player in action at like Best Buy or something and

22:36.400 --> 22:40.200
you know what? Not ready to drop a thousand dollars on it that's for sure

22:40.200 --> 22:41.760
or whatever they're trying to do. $600?

22:41.760 --> 22:46.120
I don't know. Honestly, $360 if they're gonna release that they're gonna have to do it

22:46.120 --> 22:49.840
like $200 at most for that player for me to be interested in it because the

22:49.840 --> 22:56.560
picture quality is not that much better and if blu-ray is only supposed to look

22:56.560 --> 23:01.880
that good I am not impressed with the technology you know at this time I just

23:01.880 --> 23:07.080
don't think there's gonna be it's not that huge of improvement over existing

23:07.080 --> 23:11.960
DVDs on on my HD I don't know it's just me we have another email from Mark from

23:11.960 --> 23:17.520
Australia who is actually is one of the it's a very interesting email go ahead

23:17.520 --> 23:23.980
and I read this out loud, I've just finished listening to episode 187 and once again I

23:23.980 --> 23:27.400
hear you guys defending violent content in video games.

23:27.400 --> 23:33.040
It seems to be a topic that is forever raising its ugly head in almost every single show.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.720
Now although I'm a gamer and particularly love violent content in the games I play,

23:36.720 --> 23:38.800
I find your arguments always seem to be one sided.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.280
I've never heard anyone from Orange Lawns Radio seriously and intelligently consider

23:42.280 --> 23:45.800
whether it's bad for kids or more so if it's bad for adults.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.720
can simulated killing really be good for your head?

23:48.720 --> 23:52.040
Loki asks the question, what's worse, simulated killing or killing a deer?

23:52.040 --> 23:56.160
I'm sure Loki has no idea about the answer to this question but proceeds to speak in

23:56.160 --> 24:00.480
a high pitched voice mimicking the mothers of the affected kids, his only objective is

24:00.480 --> 24:01.860
to try to offend them.

24:01.860 --> 24:07.240
If he calmed down and put some thought into his answers he might seem credible.

24:07.240 --> 24:13.320
I actually responded to him and in my email I said that the viewpoint we've been coming

24:13.320 --> 24:18.160
from is more on the rebuttal standpoint where we're given a limited scope of

24:18.160 --> 24:22.920
what to defend basically we have all these people and I honestly think the

24:22.920 --> 24:29.560
ones that are saying you know ban it ban it ban it are very one-sided very you

24:29.560 --> 24:33.080
know not willing to put a lot of thought into it no I fully agree and I've

24:33.080 --> 24:38.280
actually said this in the past I said it today you know there is a certain age

24:38.280 --> 24:44.480
where you have to be careful with what you expose your children to, but any, I

24:44.480 --> 24:51.680
should say, mature adult, any person who's above a certain age and has a certain

24:51.680 --> 24:59.600
ability to tell reality from, you know, fantasy, would be able to intelligently

24:59.600 --> 25:06.480
know the difference between picking up your controller and killing a bunch of

25:06.480 --> 25:09.200
of pixels or 3D rendered models,

25:09.200 --> 25:13.080
then taking an Uzi and blowing away your school.

25:13.080 --> 25:17.120
I think that an intelligent, sane human being

25:17.120 --> 25:19.080
would be able to tell the difference.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.480
I, yeah, I absolutely agree with that,

25:21.480 --> 25:24.280
and I think, you know, the listener who wrote us an email

25:25.400 --> 25:29.920
said something about how we never say that kids,

25:29.920 --> 25:31.820
or the games aren't harmful to kids.

25:32.760 --> 25:36.040
Games, video games are harmful to some kids,

25:36.040 --> 25:40.480
kids who don't know any better. And for me, though, that's really up to a parent to make

25:40.480 --> 25:46.000
that determination. Is a game going to be harmful to the child or not? Is the child

25:46.000 --> 25:51.400
going to be mature enough to play this game that I'm going to buy for them with my money?

25:51.400 --> 25:55.120
And certainly there are some games that some children should not be playing, but that's

25:55.120 --> 25:58.680
really up to the parent to make the decision there. And that's kind of just my thoughts

25:58.680 --> 25:59.440
on it.

25:59.440 --> 26:03.000
Loki, do you have anything you want to say about the mom impressions or whatever?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.120
not knowing what I'm talking about or something?

26:05.120 --> 26:06.120
Yeah.

26:06.120 --> 26:12.640
Well, okay, I may not have killed a deer or, you know, an animal of that sort or whatever,

26:12.640 --> 26:18.560
but I mean you can definitely argue that killing something that doesn't exist except in a virtual

26:18.560 --> 26:23.960
world is probably gonna be less violent than going out and actually killing something that's

26:23.960 --> 26:25.960
alive.

26:25.960 --> 26:29.280
I mean, that's pretty- any idiot can tell you that.

26:29.280 --> 26:35.440
I mean, if I kill, you know, a virtual hooker I guess, it's not a real person, they don't

26:35.440 --> 26:39.880
have feelings, their family's not going to worry about, you know, they're not going to

26:39.880 --> 26:44.160
be all upset if I kill her, she just responds later and I go kill her again, it doesn't

26:44.160 --> 26:45.160
matter.

26:45.160 --> 26:49.600
Whereas, you know, if I go kill, you know, my next door neighbor, that's a little different.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.540
More people are impacted by that.

26:51.540 --> 26:57.800
So how can you say that I'm wrong in saying that killing a virtual person is nowhere near

26:57.800 --> 27:02.600
to the effect of killing, you know, something real. Even if it's not a human person, say

27:02.600 --> 27:07.920
you kill, you know, an animal or something, you know, kids are, you know, brought up knowing

27:07.920 --> 27:11.360
that animals are cute and stuff, and if you take them out into the wilderness without

27:11.360 --> 27:16.280
obviously educating them and stuff, and you go and blow away Bambi, I mean, that's going

27:16.280 --> 27:20.960
to be a little, you know, that's going to probably shock them more than saying killing

27:20.960 --> 27:24.200
virtual, you know, prostitute Betty, I don't know.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.200
also you speaking of that you know what's worse going out and killing a

27:28.200 --> 27:32.880
deer for the sport of it or killing a deer because you're hungry and you need

27:32.880 --> 27:39.160
food you know that there's I think everything is situational okay or what

27:39.160 --> 27:43.200
about see someone has broken into your house and has a gun at your head I'm

27:43.200 --> 27:48.800
going to shoot them okay I don't care I will do what it takes to defend my house

27:48.800 --> 27:53.960
if they are in my property and they're threatening to kill me hell yeah I would

27:53.960 --> 27:54.960
strike out at them.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.600
It seems to be going a little into the what-ifs.

27:59.600 --> 28:05.080
When you're looking at these types of situations, when you're going out for the purpose of killing

28:05.080 --> 28:09.640
somebody for sport, that's when you need to look at your level of sanity.

28:09.640 --> 28:14.720
When you've got something for defense or you're hunting something for your survival, that's

28:14.720 --> 28:16.560
not even something that should be comparable.

28:16.560 --> 28:24.900
I think that even comparing, you know, virtual violence, you can't compare that to reality.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.320
There's no basis.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.640
And yeah, the games are not meant for kids, and to be honest, they shouldn't be playing

28:30.640 --> 28:31.640
them.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.640
That's why we have ratings on the back of them.

28:32.640 --> 28:37.320
If you give it to your kid, then obviously you think that he is ready, or he or she is

28:37.320 --> 28:40.200
ready to see what is in the game.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.680
And the same goes with R-rated movies.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.960
Firebomber was pointing out that I'm at Ted Nugent's level.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.120
He's a survivalist though, Ted Nugent's cool.

28:49.120 --> 28:53.080
I think it was interesting the deer hunting thing that got brought up, because then Pooeater

28:53.080 --> 28:57.400
in our chat room says, I killed deers in Deer Hunter 3, which makes me think that's a game

28:57.400 --> 29:01.720
that you see in the lobby of every Walmart across the nation, which is just kind of an

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
interesting observation.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.720
I strangely found one in an Irish pub.

29:04.720 --> 29:10.140
Anyway, thanks for the email, I mean, you know, we like thought-provoking, intelligently

29:10.140 --> 29:12.240
written emails, so good job.

29:12.240 --> 29:18.000
You know, because in a year I'm planning on having a sproutlet.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I'm planning on breeding.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
A spawn.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
I'm going to have Jamie spawn.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.320
But, you know, I'm not going to have my little kid playing, you know, going out and playing

29:28.320 --> 29:31.640
Halo when he's, you know, three or four.

29:31.640 --> 29:37.700
But you know, when I'm sure that my kid, you know, has the ability, you know, understands

29:37.700 --> 29:42.540
the difference between reality and fantasy then you know I wouldn't mind if

29:42.540 --> 29:45.480
they're in there watching me play in Halo as long as they understand the

29:45.480 --> 29:48.880
difference if they start reenacting it they get their butt popped and I tell

29:48.880 --> 29:52.520
them no not enough parents spank their children either but that's another

29:52.520 --> 29:59.760
story I was raised I was spanked when I was bad that's a whole nother cup of tea

29:59.760 --> 30:02.800
I'm not even gonna get into I'm not I'm not gonna but I'm gonna say that as a

30:02.800 --> 30:07.160
parent yeah I would discipline my child if I saw them dangerously reenacting

30:07.160 --> 30:10.940
something you teach them the difference between right and wrong when you just

30:10.940 --> 30:17.300
when you when you conceive that child it is your responsibility to make sure that

30:17.300 --> 30:21.380
they learn how to be a proper adult childhood is what prepares you for

30:21.380 --> 30:26.180
being a grown-up all right okay I think you might get more letters on from this

30:26.180 --> 30:29.420
I want more letters as long as they're intelligently written that's all yes

30:29.420 --> 30:37.420
yeah and have good grammar. I got an email from Cameron saying hey I was

30:37.420 --> 30:41.740
wondering your thoughts on Banjo-Kazooie for DS. Rare is already porting Diddy Kong

30:41.740 --> 30:46.420
Racing from the 64 DS and EGM rumored that a Banjo-Kazooie game was also

30:46.420 --> 30:50.360
coming to DS as a port or new. I want to know if you think it will happen also do

30:50.360 --> 30:53.620
you think any Banjo-Kazooie games will make it to live arcade thank you thank

30:53.620 --> 30:58.420
you for the show. First of all I won't make it a live arcade because I don't

30:58.420 --> 31:01.420
Does Nintendo still have part of the rights on that?

31:01.420 --> 31:05.420
I don't know. When it comes to Banjo-Kazooie, who technically owns that? Rare or Nintendo?

31:05.420 --> 31:09.420
Rare has it. I don't think you'd see it on DS at all for that reason.

31:09.420 --> 31:14.420
But Xbox Live Arcade, definitely a possibility, but not for a long time.

31:14.420 --> 31:17.420
I honestly didn't like the Banjo-Kazooie series, so I haven't...

31:17.420 --> 31:21.420
Yeah, I gotta be honest. It wasn't really a series of games I played a whole lot of.

31:21.420 --> 31:25.420
Magus, you seem to be a little more up on the know with that. Do you have any thoughts?

31:25.420 --> 31:30.420
No, I haven't played Banjo-Kazooie since it came out.

31:30.420 --> 31:36.420
Well, this listener is going to be very disappointed in our feedback on that one, sorry.

31:36.420 --> 31:40.420
You know, if it's rare though, I think rare, Microsoft's really where they're headed,

31:40.420 --> 31:44.420
I wouldn't be looking for them doing a lot on DS.

31:44.420 --> 31:47.420
Diddy Kong's different, you know, because that was a Nintendo character,

31:47.420 --> 31:49.420
and Nintendo still owns the rights, so...

31:49.420 --> 31:52.420
Yeah, they might do Banjo-Kazooie just once for old time's sake, but I doubt it.

31:52.420 --> 31:56.540
But I doubt it. I don't see that happening even for old times sake just because of legal stuff

31:56.900 --> 32:01.140
So well, we've got a couple more emails to go through here

32:02.900 --> 32:05.920
To move forward we also have one from

32:06.540 --> 32:11.160
Paul saying what was any of your worst experience with a video game store?

32:11.160 --> 32:21.000
Wow, I need more time to think about that. Worst experience at a video game store?

32:21.000 --> 32:27.400
I have to say it was EB before the GameStop merge, because there were some really not

32:27.400 --> 32:31.520
knowledgeable people at a couple of the EB's I've been to. I've never had a problem at a GameStop,

32:31.520 --> 32:37.080
but then again, they all know me. Yeah, you're kind of lucky in that regard. You know, I would

32:37.080 --> 32:41.080
say more recently, this is kind of a weak answer, but I didn't have a lot of time to

32:41.080 --> 32:45.320
think about this one, walking into a gaming store time and time again, not being able

32:45.320 --> 32:49.880
to locate an Xbox 360 for many months, and kind of being laughed at when asking about

32:49.880 --> 32:50.880
it.

32:50.880 --> 32:55.360
That's, you know, it's like, you know, come on, guy, okay, I didn't pre-order it, get

32:55.360 --> 32:56.360
over it.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.360
Just tell me if you have or not.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.760
But also think about how many times they get asked that during the day.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.760
I know, but you know what?

32:59.760 --> 33:00.760
That's part of the job.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.440
You should be used to it, you know.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.320
People are going to come into the bank and ask many times a day, how do I withdraw money

33:05.320 --> 33:06.320
for my account?

33:06.320 --> 33:10.040
it's just part of the job get used to it but there's also that I actually had a

33:10.040 --> 33:13.580
really awful experience at a Walmart and I think you were there with me when we

33:13.580 --> 33:19.520
were waiting trying to get that a DS out of the not a DS an SP out of the this no

33:19.520 --> 33:22.280
Julie was with me I don't recall it Julie was with me because we were

33:22.280 --> 33:28.640
picking up one before before some convention and no one was coming we asked

33:28.640 --> 33:31.640
people oh I don't know I don't have a key and they weren't finding anyone but

33:31.640 --> 33:32.640
that was Walmart.

33:32.640 --> 33:36.700
Logan, do you have any stories or magus, anybody?

33:36.700 --> 33:42.320
I would say, there was that one time I was buying that memory card thing, kind of like

33:42.320 --> 33:49.200
a, where you can rip memory card saves off of like a Playstation card.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.200
Dex Drive?

33:50.200 --> 33:53.120
Yeah, like a Dex Drive, but not as a third party thing.

33:53.120 --> 34:00.040
And the guy was acting stupid, I don't remember what he was doing, he was acting really retarded.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.840
But then there was another time I was trying to buy a PSP at launch, he's all, good luck

34:03.840 --> 34:08.100
finding one, hahaha, I went to Best Buy and there was like a ton of them sitting there,

34:08.100 --> 34:10.540
so yeah.

34:10.540 --> 34:16.020
But I remember like I said last week, I overheard in one of the Game Stops that they don't even

34:16.020 --> 34:22.140
inform their employees on what games are coming out and what the games are, they basically

34:22.140 --> 34:27.540
are told to read the Game Informer magazine, which, that's stupid.

34:27.540 --> 34:31.540
Eh, whatever.

34:31.540 --> 34:32.540
Megas?

34:32.540 --> 34:35.540
Eh, mine's more of a general thing. Just, okay.

34:35.540 --> 34:39.540
Tip to GameStop, EB Games, whatever.

34:39.540 --> 34:43.540
Uh, your employees are selling games.

34:43.540 --> 34:47.540
They should know something about the games they're selling.

34:47.540 --> 34:51.540
If you have a person that's completely clueless, you don't employ them.

34:51.540 --> 34:54.540
Or you have them learn first, right?

34:54.540 --> 34:59.240
From what I understand from Gametop employees I've talked to, at least that chain, Gamestop

34:59.240 --> 35:05.060
has a policy where they can get magazines for free to read up on what's going on.

35:05.060 --> 35:07.720
How many employees take advantage of that or whether they're encouraged to, I don't

35:07.720 --> 35:08.720
know, I haven't worked there.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.520
But I do know at least they have that policy, which is interesting.

35:11.520 --> 35:17.720
I'm probably going to have to second the issue with employees mocking customers who

35:17.720 --> 35:22.680
didn't pre-order their thing, didn't pre-order their product, and then are surprised that

35:22.680 --> 35:24.040
it's not in stock.

35:24.040 --> 35:28.960
Yeah, we know we can't always pre-order things, but you don't have to get in our face for

35:28.960 --> 35:29.960
it.

35:29.960 --> 35:30.960
No.

35:30.960 --> 35:36.080
Honestly, I think that if you know something's going to be hard to get and you want to make

35:36.080 --> 35:38.600
sure you have your copy, freakin' pre-order it.

35:38.600 --> 35:43.080
It's $5 out of your pocket, and if it turns out it's something that you don't want, you

35:43.080 --> 35:45.460
can move it to something else.

35:45.460 --> 35:46.460
It's not hard.

35:46.460 --> 35:47.460
I don't agree.

35:47.460 --> 35:50.840
I don't pre-order games, and I don't like that kind of commitment, and I feel like it's

35:50.840 --> 35:53.520
almost like I don't want to commit that I'm going to buy.

35:53.520 --> 35:58.520
I don't care. You're not committing that you're buying it. 60 bucks. 60 bucks. That's a hell of a commitment.

35:58.520 --> 36:03.520
For a game it's five dollars. For a game it's five dollars. What about a game system?

36:03.520 --> 36:08.520
Games are easy to come by. And if you don't want it, you can get your money back.

36:08.520 --> 36:15.520
It's not that hard. It's in the store to credit. I feel like those stores try to force me into it.

36:15.520 --> 36:19.520
It's the whole thing. I don't like being told I have to do something. Nobody does.

36:19.520 --> 36:26.520
Hey, I preordered my Xbox 360 system about when they were taking preorders.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.520
And do you think that they are responsible for Microsoft's error?

36:29.520 --> 36:34.520
No, I think they are responsible for taking the amount of preorders that they are going to get systems.

36:34.520 --> 36:38.520
They did take the number of preorders that they thought they were getting systems and then Microsoft screwed them over.

36:38.520 --> 36:41.520
Well that's their problem. That's not my problem.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.520
That's Microsoft's problem.

36:42.520 --> 36:43.520
No, that is their problem.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.520
They didn't they didn't create the shortage

36:45.560 --> 36:50.080
Microsoft did if you have an issue with it you take it to Microsoft the one who created the problem if I have a customer

36:50.080 --> 36:56.560
Doesn't get their movies on time because the said company or whatever doesn't ship them on time. It's our problem

36:57.040 --> 36:59.040
Not that I completely disagree

36:59.720 --> 37:05.320
Well, you go and tell your customer. Oh, I'm sorry. You can't get your system because Microsoft didn't ship it call Microsoft

37:05.320 --> 37:11.940
They're gonna say fuck you. Why did you say I can get one on launch date then? I'm sorry. That's called stupid customer

37:13.540 --> 37:18.720
That's called a customer doesn't want to shop and pre-order any of their games that's called the customer is a lazy-ass

37:19.520 --> 37:25.320
No, it's that's exactly how I feel to inform their customers if they inform them exactly the source

37:25.320 --> 37:29.820
Hey, they had shortages before with the PlayStation 2 if they knew that this was gonna be a typical problem

37:29.820 --> 37:33.440
They could say you know any Microsoft two completely different companies

37:33.440 --> 37:40.440
companies. How is what one company do illustrate what another company is going to do? Please

37:40.440 --> 37:45.480
answer that. Tell me exactly how is the behavior of a completely different entity going to

37:45.480 --> 37:48.320
explain how another completely different entity is going to perform.

37:48.320 --> 37:53.600
The companies operate in a similar fashion as far as hardware launches.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.920
Microsoft doesn't have to deal with having their orders come from basically a foreign

37:56.920 --> 38:02.740
source. Microsoft is all located this side of the country. Anything that Sony does has

38:02.740 --> 38:05.060
to have approval from Sony of Japan.

38:05.060 --> 38:10.160
Actually Microsoft systems, I believe, were being manufactured in foreign countries.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.820
It doesn't matter where it's manufactured, it matters where the business decisions are

38:12.820 --> 38:13.820
being made.

38:13.820 --> 38:20.980
Anyway, to go on to the next email, we also have one from Ricky.

38:20.980 --> 38:28.340
It says, one of our 15 year old listeners, says he's been listening to our show for the

38:28.340 --> 38:30.220
past two years and he's quite impressed.

38:30.220 --> 38:31.940
Let's get to the point, is what it says.

38:31.940 --> 38:36.500
Anyway, I was browsing around on the net and I stumbled across a gif, which happened to

38:36.500 --> 38:41.260
be someone's avatar for a certain forum, um, from the image of this year's E3.

38:41.260 --> 38:46.140
It was Ken Kutaragi, um, actually you did spell it right, kudos to you, um, wording

38:46.140 --> 38:50.740
his, uh, mouth to the phrase Ridge Racer and it kept playing the words back and forth.

38:50.740 --> 39:01.700
Um, he recognized a face in this, um, it says that none other, it actually said it was Rob

39:01.700 --> 39:02.700
in this GIF?

39:02.700 --> 39:06.520
Yeah, I've actually, you know what, somebody posted something similar in our forums that

39:06.520 --> 39:11.400
supposedly there's some reaction shot of me at some press conference, but here's the thing

39:11.400 --> 39:12.400
guys, it's not me.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.400
At least the picture I saw wasn't me, I guess I didn't even think the guy looked like me,

39:16.400 --> 39:21.120
but maybe there's something, I tried going into the mailbag and looking at it and there

39:21.120 --> 39:25.800
was no GIF image attached, so I would ask that listener to try resending it, but just

39:25.800 --> 39:29.140
so you know, when the Sony press conference was going on, we were not there.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.260
We were not at any of the big three press conferences.

39:31.260 --> 39:34.940
I wish we were that popular amongst them, but unfortunately not all those companies

39:34.940 --> 39:40.840
have embraced podcasting yet, with the exception of Microsoft, but of course, you know, Major

39:40.840 --> 39:43.860
Nelson works for them, so that's the podcast that's definitely going to be...

39:43.860 --> 39:46.920
Actually, I would say Microsoft a little more than the others, you know, even, because I

39:46.920 --> 39:52.560
know some other friendly podcasts we know of went to that conference, so that's cool.

39:52.560 --> 39:58.740
But anyway, regardless, during the Sony Prep Conference, we were actually at the Arena

39:58.740 --> 40:04.940
a lounge in Santa Monica watching it on the big screen TV on a live feed and nobody was

40:04.940 --> 40:10.180
taking pictures of our reaction shots and really I didn't have a problem with Sony's

40:10.180 --> 40:15.420
conference until the very end to be honest and then kind of sitting back and reflecting

40:15.420 --> 40:19.820
on it, it just kind of got worse so I really don't think that pictures me because I don't

40:19.820 --> 40:20.820
know where it came from.

40:20.820 --> 40:24.700
It's like eating bad McDonald's, it was bad to begin with and then just kind of festers

40:24.700 --> 40:26.060
in your stomach.

40:26.060 --> 40:32.180
And also, I spend most of E3 hanging out with either Loki, Dark Sakura, or Bobby from All

40:32.180 --> 40:37.260
Games, so if you don't see them in the picture either, it's probably not me.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.260
Sorry.

40:38.260 --> 40:41.900
Also, we got an email and I'm using this as an example.

40:41.900 --> 40:46.660
Someone sent us an email that consists of only, hi.

40:46.660 --> 40:51.020
Don't send me emails that just say hi, because what I'm going to do in the future when I

40:51.020 --> 40:56.180
see emails like this is I'm going to delete it and keep a list of your name.

40:56.180 --> 41:01.540
Well hi back I guess. I appreciate you taking the time to send such a

41:01.540 --> 41:05.820
thoughtful and well-written email. I'm not mentioning the person's name on.

41:05.820 --> 41:12.440
They also didn't put a subject in there all they wrote was hi. You know now we're

41:12.440 --> 41:16.540
gonna get like 30 emails this week just say hi hi hi. And what I will do is on

41:16.540 --> 41:23.220
on our forum I will post their email addresses so that we can sign them up for some porn

41:23.220 --> 41:24.220
filters.

41:24.220 --> 41:29.660
I think you really need it by posting them to the forum and probably just do that automatically

41:29.660 --> 41:31.140
with all those bots out there.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.700
Yeah, there is that.

41:32.700 --> 41:34.860
Any other emails besides the high email?

41:34.860 --> 41:38.500
Just the ones that worship me as their goddess and, you know, those I usually just send to

41:38.500 --> 41:39.500
my personal email.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.580
Oh yeah, all one of those emails.

41:41.580 --> 41:42.580
Hey!

41:42.580 --> 41:43.580
Alright.

41:43.580 --> 41:47.220
You can shut the hell up right now.

41:47.220 --> 41:50.460
Magus got a total zing there. You sent yourself.

41:50.460 --> 41:53.580
That is bull. My husband sent him.

41:53.580 --> 41:56.580
DM, I need some ATH points for Magus. A good five points for him please.

41:56.580 --> 42:01.260
You know what? You need to... I think he's upgraded from toilet paper to

42:01.260 --> 42:05.980
a cardboard box for his jokebook. Alright, anyway, we gotta keep it moving here.

42:05.980 --> 42:09.940
Again, if you have emails, mail back at Orangelaunchradio.com

42:09.940 --> 42:14.620
During the break here, live only, we were talking about some gaming pieces that were

42:14.620 --> 42:16.380
in the media recently.

42:16.380 --> 42:22.660
One piece we were saving here for part B was Nightline.

42:22.660 --> 42:29.100
Basically what happened is that Nightline recently did this story here talking about

42:29.100 --> 42:34.540
the Pentagon and how kind of dumb they looked when they mistook a bit of Mashima for a terrorist

42:34.540 --> 42:38.700
training tool and showed it to the House Intelligence Committee.

42:38.700 --> 42:43.580
Tapper basically said this, terrorists twisting an American video game into a jihadist training

42:43.580 --> 42:47.080
tool and then proceeds to lay out how the whole thing happened, including getting an

42:47.080 --> 42:52.740
anonymous interview with a European gamer who created the now infamous terrorist battlefield

42:52.740 --> 42:54.220
clip.

42:54.220 --> 42:58.500
The Pentagon is still claiming that the mashema is being used by terrorists.

42:58.500 --> 43:04.320
Tapper is calling bullshit on this excuse and tells the Pentagon so, basically.

43:04.320 --> 43:09.720
And there's a quote here, uh, we should really be questioning the kind of advice that Congress

43:09.720 --> 43:16.780
is getting, and that comes from, uh, Georgia Tech Ian Boggess, who's in the piece.

43:16.780 --> 43:23.260
It was a parody of, um, Team America World Police.

43:23.260 --> 43:25.400
That's what the machimo was.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.400
That's very interesting.

43:26.400 --> 43:31.520
So, I don't know, that was interesting to you.

43:31.520 --> 43:38.520
stupid intelligence, but kind of unrelated to that whole thing, the Fragdolls and the

43:38.520 --> 43:47.520
PMS Clan, they're boycotting the World Series of Video Gaming, Grolov, I guess, contest

43:47.520 --> 43:51.320
or whatever. They're doing some pageant contests that has to do with the World Series of Video

43:51.320 --> 43:59.440
Games. The Miss WSVG contest, and the only game-related requirement for the contestants

43:59.440 --> 44:04.640
are, you know, to list what their favorite game is. And of course that didn't sit too

44:04.640 --> 44:17.160
well with either clan, which basically protesting the contest by holding their own guy talent

44:17.160 --> 44:23.620
con- or beauty contest as well. It says it's not really a video gamer who will be crowned,

44:23.620 --> 44:34.180
a model. And that was the PMS co-founder Amber Dalton who told the Courier Journal. And basically,

44:34.180 --> 44:40.340
I don't know, one of the funny things that I keep seeing back is the, like for example,

44:40.340 --> 44:46.020
the World Series of video games they shot back with. The Fragdolls in PMS Clan have

44:46.020 --> 44:53.300
stated that they plan to run the Mr. WSVG competition in the Tourist Next Stop in Dallas.

44:53.300 --> 44:59.060
If this happens, in order to be fair, the World Series of Video Gaming may feel compelled

44:59.060 --> 45:02.820
to run another beauty contest as well.

45:02.820 --> 45:06.540
And then of course, other gamers who have been reading this are saying, well, those

45:06.540 --> 45:11.140
two clans suck anyways as far as gaming goes, they don't even compete on a professional

45:11.140 --> 45:12.140
level.

45:12.140 --> 45:14.940
So I thought that was funny.

45:14.940 --> 45:19.180
I don't really know enough about those clans to pass judgment on it, so I'm just going

45:19.180 --> 45:22.860
to refrain from commenting, although I would love to have a representative on the program

45:22.860 --> 45:26.260
at some point to kind of give their perspective.

45:26.260 --> 45:29.740
I know that they've been given a lot of shit online about how many...

45:29.740 --> 45:34.900
I think the PMS Clan specifically, they have their gamer cards linked on Xbox.com, and

45:34.900 --> 45:39.740
I think like most of them have under 1k points, except one girl's got a ton.

45:39.740 --> 45:42.580
But then they say, well that's because we're playing Halo 2 and you don't get points for

45:42.580 --> 45:43.580
that.

45:43.580 --> 45:44.580
Yeah, they have Halo 2.

45:44.580 --> 45:45.860
But the other thing that I thought was funny was...

45:45.860 --> 45:49.000
It's just, you know, and with all respect to them, because again I don't know them,

45:49.000 --> 45:54.580
It does seem interesting though, they are linked from xbox.com, wouldn't you knowing

45:54.580 --> 45:57.920
that, wanna buff up the 360 games?

45:57.920 --> 45:58.920
I don't know.

45:58.920 --> 46:04.240
I know they play Halo 2 a lot, granted, and one of the funny things I was reading is that

46:04.240 --> 46:12.160
they're actually coming out with their casual gaming portion of the clan.

46:12.160 --> 46:15.520
So there's gonna be some experts at UNO or something, I don't know.

46:15.520 --> 46:20.520
But I'm all for a casual game, you don't have to be hardcore all the time.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.920
Are you going to be entering the Hot Man competition, Loki?

46:22.920 --> 46:23.920
I think you should be in it.

46:23.920 --> 46:27.080
I think it would be funny, because you know they're going to get all these, you know,

46:27.080 --> 46:28.080
male models.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.080
Well, here's the problem, though.

46:29.080 --> 46:30.080
I think Loki should be up there.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.080
Here's the problem, though.

46:31.080 --> 46:35.800
It's in Dallas, and it's also, they're a ways away.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
Chat room?

46:36.800 --> 46:39.680
I think we should have someone go on there in an asbestos suit and set themselves on

46:39.680 --> 46:40.680
fire.

46:40.680 --> 46:47.680
chat room, who would like to contribute to a Send Loki to Dallas fund?

46:49.240 --> 46:56.240
Our other sales branches in Dallas. Well there you go, you need to take a work trip.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.880
You know, the whole argument with the fact that they don't have a lot of gamer points

47:01.880 --> 47:07.520
doesn't really count with me, because if you're playing a lot of multiplayer games and stuff,

47:07.520 --> 47:11.200
not a lot of points may be coming from that, especially if you're not playing like, you

47:11.200 --> 47:17.480
know, which, although, although the PMS clan, I think it was the PMS clan, I can't remember

47:17.480 --> 47:24.480
which one's sponsored by Ubisoft, they have, they better be, you know, having high achievement

47:24.960 --> 47:28.320
points because, you know, they gotta be playing the new Ghost Recon, and the only system you

47:28.320 --> 47:33.200
gotta be playing now is the 360, so, well you should be playing on the 360 because that's

47:33.200 --> 47:39.080
the best one all right well we'll see what happens with that and I do we just

47:39.080 --> 47:42.840
want pictures of the winners on all ends just send us some sexy pictures of the

47:42.840 --> 47:47.080
winners from all the contests that's all we asked for I have nothing nothing

47:47.080 --> 47:49.920
against you know female clans I mean especially if they're competing out

47:49.920 --> 47:55.160
there great you know just great I mean just don't you know make it sound like

47:55.160 --> 47:59.920
you're the best people in the world we need to have like the oil army as a

47:59.920 --> 48:04.880
gaming clan I thought about that except I suck we have a lot of girls that

48:04.880 --> 48:10.440
listen to this show for just various games that aren't your supermodel girl

48:10.440 --> 48:14.720
types that Microsoft's would want to flaunt about at their booth or whatever

48:14.720 --> 48:18.960
that's just fine by me I like my girls normal you know not that I date girls

48:18.960 --> 48:24.320
but you know I like socializing with normal girls you know I and I say we

48:24.320 --> 48:28.240
form a clan and all that stuff let's do it send some emails if you're interested

48:28.240 --> 48:35.940
It's not just women. We can have a clan on a chrome hounds. We are get that no

48:35.940 --> 48:41.660
We're going to be the multi-game clan the old army. Well, they're gonna have actual clans and chrome hounds. So I

48:43.100 --> 48:48.880
You have to go army. All right. Anyway, let's move on here. We got to get to this story about the PSP

48:49.580 --> 48:54.940
And we haven't heard a lot of great, you know stuff system selling at things coming to the PSP

48:54.940 --> 48:57.020
But this might be something that turns some heads

48:57.020 --> 49:02.980
there's going to be a TiVo update and what the next TiVo update will do is

49:02.980 --> 49:09.700
it's going to convert TiVo shows into PSP friendly formats by the way you can

49:09.700 --> 49:14.660
also convert it for iPod or trio it's only going to cost $25 for that

49:14.660 --> 49:19.500
functionality which by the way you can find utilities on the internet to do it

49:19.500 --> 49:24.340
for free but okay whatever it's going to be a legal and blessed thing from TiVo

49:24.340 --> 49:30.380
So it's kind of interesting because now the PSP can kind of you know have that hey put your TiVo programs here on your PSP

49:30.380 --> 49:35.740
That might be something to sell the PSP and certainly I get more competitive with the iPod even though

49:35.740 --> 49:38.600
I don't know iPod and PSP are so different anyway

49:38.600 --> 49:42.660
But for some people when it's one or the other that might be something that kind of you know

49:42.660 --> 49:44.700
Makes the PSP look a little more alluring too

49:44.700 --> 49:51.020
I think it's just that they're gonna be planning on doing this anyways with the whole ps3 and the you know

49:51.460 --> 49:53.460
was it a

49:53.460 --> 49:57.400
their wireless some streaming system that they've got their

49:57.400 --> 50:02.780
the location free players so they're probably going to be bringing something very similar

50:02.780 --> 50:07.820
Alright. Guess what?

50:07.820 --> 50:12.660
What? You remember when we played that Pirates of the Caribbean game?

50:12.660 --> 50:15.660
Yes, at E3.

50:15.660 --> 50:20.040
Well it's been officially stated Johnny Depp is doing his

50:20.040 --> 50:23.520
lending his voice talent to the game for Captain Jack Sparrow

50:23.520 --> 50:28.320
oh yeah that game I thought was pretty cool

50:28.320 --> 50:31.480
you know had all kinds of little hidden stuff thrown in it you know what I did

50:31.480 --> 50:32.120
notice

50:32.120 --> 50:35.840
you know remember though that they didn't have a

50:35.840 --> 50:39.160
dude in it

50:39.160 --> 50:43.000
why is the name suddenly escaping me? I'm Johnny Depp

50:43.000 --> 50:46.080
thank you no no Orlando Bloom thank you

50:46.080 --> 50:49.680
he isn't they actually got a voice

50:49.680 --> 51:00.320
a similar voice to it. But there's a quote on here from Johnny Depp that doing voiceovers

51:00.320 --> 51:04.560
is a great fun and a lot easier than stumbling about pretending to be Keith Richards or having

51:04.560 --> 51:09.320
scissors glued to your fingers all day. He did not add.

51:09.320 --> 51:14.520
You know, all things considered, the game looked decent.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.520
That wasn't a quote, by the way.

51:15.520 --> 51:22.040
I know, it looked like your typical movie to game translation, but on the, you know,

51:22.040 --> 51:24.880
they didn't fuck it up, and like the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory games, you know,

51:24.880 --> 51:26.020
they didn't fuck it up.

51:26.020 --> 51:30.340
It looked pretty solid, I think, but the Johnny Depp quotient is going to sell a lot more

51:30.340 --> 51:31.340
of this title.

51:31.340 --> 51:34.200
I think it was a smart clinching there to get the game on board.

51:34.200 --> 51:38.640
This announcement here, though, is from Eurogamer, so I love the jokes they're putting in here.

51:38.640 --> 51:41.480
For example, they said, why are pirates called pirates?

51:41.480 --> 51:44.040
Because they are.

51:44.040 --> 51:51.040
Oh my god. That's so bad. Wow. That's fantastic. That was bad. But yeah, we saw this when we

51:52.960 --> 51:58.840
saw the demo at E3. It was pretty cool. It was a pretty neat little game. If you're a

51:58.840 --> 52:03.280
fan of the movies, you'll get a kick out of it. It'll entertain you for a little while.

52:03.280 --> 52:10.280
Really, really hokey. That joke there. Anyways, as far as Xbox Live, there's going to be some

52:10.280 --> 52:14.640
is Xbox Live. There's going to be some demos coming soon. The first one of course, which

52:14.640 --> 52:22.160
should have come out by now but hasn't, Prey is supposed to be hitting Xbox Live Marketplace

52:22.160 --> 52:26.760
pretty soon. If you can't wait though and you have a decent enough PC, you can actually

52:26.760 --> 52:30.820
download the PC demo for free on a lot of the major gaming sites, so definitely check

52:30.820 --> 52:36.160
that out. The other demo that's also slated for August 1st, which would be Saints Row,

52:36.160 --> 52:39.880
and that's going to be coming pretty soon. I think sometime in July, Texas Hold'em is

52:39.880 --> 52:44.320
supposed to be coming out so lots of good stuff hopefully and no word on

52:44.320 --> 52:52.360
streetfare yet so that kind of sucks all right um what we want to do now is allow

52:52.360 --> 52:58.000
dark Sakura to tell us what website she's been looking at this week because

52:58.000 --> 53:03.120
she serves the internet up and down left and right front and back all over and

53:03.120 --> 53:06.480
tries to find the website that you need to be looking at this week so dark

53:06.480 --> 53:11.900
Sakura where should kids be pointing their browsers this week this is a site

53:11.900 --> 53:15.960
that I spend quite a bit of time on and you know it's not actually just because

53:15.960 --> 53:23.700
I also moderate there is gorillas unofficial it I was a big fan of this

53:23.700 --> 53:28.860
site before I was you know asked on as one of the moderators there and

53:28.860 --> 53:35.640
basically this I have to say to Jay he's so amazing with how quickly he gets the

53:35.640 --> 53:40.320
updates up any any new information that said he has it up on there they're linked

53:40.320 --> 53:45.300
through live journal if you add a gorillas news to your live journal feed

53:45.300 --> 53:49.820
it goes directly off gorillasunofficial.com it's actually gorillas-unofficial.com

53:49.820 --> 53:54.100
the forms there are great well maintained again not just because I'm

53:54.100 --> 54:00.420
also working with you but everybody there is just really terrific they're

54:00.420 --> 54:04.980
not just that but if you go into the site actually on the splash page there's

54:04.980 --> 54:11.980
There's new art features by people in the fan art community, other fans, some official

54:11.980 --> 54:12.980
photos.

54:12.980 --> 54:14.900
You'll see something different every time.

54:14.900 --> 54:21.940
On top of that, this has probably, I'd say, one of the most complete lyrics, image, discography,

54:21.940 --> 54:22.940
everything.

54:22.940 --> 54:31.320
And there's even a translation on here by my friend Haruna, who translated what Noodle

54:31.320 --> 54:34.540
said on the Apex tapes back when she was only speaking Japanese.

54:34.540 --> 54:38.540
So check it out. Very cool site. I've been impressed with them from day one.

54:38.540 --> 54:40.540
But what if I don't like gorillas?

54:40.540 --> 54:41.540
Then screw you.

54:41.540 --> 54:43.540
Okay. Alright.

54:43.540 --> 54:45.540
Then why don't you? What's wrong with you?

54:45.540 --> 54:49.540
I like gorillas, just why. You know I love to be devil's advocate, though.

54:49.540 --> 54:50.540
I know.

54:50.540 --> 54:58.540
Exactly. But, I don't know. I'm not a huge fan of gorillas. Sorry. What can I say? I'm picky.

54:58.540 --> 55:00.540
It's because you like listening to porno music. That's why.

55:00.540 --> 55:03.540
Porno music. Hell yeah.

55:03.540 --> 55:09.580
What I am a fan of is good racing games, and Forza Motorsport 2, they had some details

55:09.580 --> 55:10.580
come out about that.

55:10.580 --> 55:17.820
It's supposed to be the big competition against Gran Turismo HD, which I don't really want

55:17.820 --> 55:19.500
to comment on that game.

55:19.500 --> 55:26.140
Anyways, what's kind of interesting is they described the brand new damage system in Forza

55:26.140 --> 55:32.860
2, and this is all coming from the latest issue of the 360 magazine, including that

55:32.860 --> 55:37.580
it took six months to create. Three damage settings will be available in the game, low,

55:37.580 --> 55:45.360
normal, and simulation for those who don't want to, they joke, reenact the great Gizmondo

55:45.360 --> 55:53.640
Ferrari crash. For photo and TV modes, they're actually collaborating with the Project Gotham

55:53.640 --> 55:58.660
development team, Bizarre Creations. So they're going to have something similar to Forza,

55:58.660 --> 56:02.020
as far as the TV very similar to Gotham TV that was in

56:02.020 --> 56:05.660
Project Gotham Racing 3 and of course better AI

56:05.660 --> 56:09.540
better graphics, downloadable content, yada yada yada yada

56:09.540 --> 56:13.180
Is that official to yada yada yada yada?

56:13.180 --> 56:17.140
That's all for me, you hit her here first yada yada yada yada

56:17.140 --> 56:20.460
Hooray!

56:20.460 --> 56:24.180
Actually

56:24.180 --> 56:27.260
as far as other stuff

56:27.260 --> 56:30.020
Going on and actually I'm sure that

56:30.660 --> 56:32.660
Megas here would appreciate this

56:33.420 --> 56:36.620
Blizzard's got some new ideas for World of Warcraft. Oh

56:38.820 --> 56:40.820
Really yeah, really

56:45.620 --> 56:46.580
Basically

56:46.580 --> 56:48.020
There's a new transfer assist

56:48.020 --> 56:55.300
They're preparing a new transfer system that will let World of Warcraft players move their characters to less polluted realms for a $25 fee

56:57.780 --> 56:59.780
They're basically wanting to

57:01.940 --> 57:07.500
Offer these services for convenience as opposed to encouraging people to spread out through the realms

57:09.300 --> 57:12.300
But it's been asked for before so they're deciding to make it a

57:12.300 --> 57:15.620
a service that will be available.

57:15.620 --> 57:18.500
I've been reading the forums about that seems to be a bit

57:18.500 --> 57:22.600
seems to be a bit of a backlash uh... people think it's too expensive people

57:22.600 --> 57:24.240
think it's not worth the effort

57:24.240 --> 57:28.980
it's like come on either you pay for the transfer which is just expensive enough

57:28.980 --> 57:29.820
to

57:29.820 --> 57:31.860
keep players from say

57:31.860 --> 57:34.340
invading a realm and crashing it

57:34.340 --> 57:35.340
seriously

57:35.340 --> 57:38.820
I mean the alternative is just to re-roll in completely new characters so

57:38.820 --> 57:42.240
it's not much of a decision there

57:42.240 --> 57:48.920
There will be restrictions on realm transfers, you can only bring a character once every

57:48.920 --> 57:52.420
six months and once you've transferred you can't take them back.

57:52.420 --> 57:56.440
The character has to be at least level 10, there's the amount of cash you can bring with

57:56.440 --> 58:03.460
you 300 gold for levels 10-30, 1000 for 31-50 and 5000-51 and above.

58:03.460 --> 58:12.540
You can only transfer to realms of the same type, PVP, PvE, I guess roleplay ones too.

58:12.540 --> 58:18.540
They're also talking about cross realm battleground feature that's coming in with patch 1.12.

58:18.540 --> 58:19.540
That's cool.

58:19.540 --> 58:25.480
It will link Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so you can fight with players

58:25.480 --> 58:26.480
from other realms.

58:26.480 --> 58:30.700
Hopefully they don't link the fucking looking for group channel across multiple servers.

58:30.700 --> 58:40.000
F, G, W, S, G. I mean, okay, devil's advocate here. Yay, so we can have our Bluebee groups

58:40.000 --> 58:47.260
trashed by tier three, no matter where they are. I mean, what's, what are the odds, you

58:47.260 --> 58:56.380
figure, of Cross Realm Battlegrounds having, okay, you have this basic pick-up group, unskilled

58:56.380 --> 59:02.120
players facing completely organized, over voice chat people are just going to roll straight

59:02.120 --> 59:03.120
over them.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.120
Can't hold you on, don't go there.

59:04.120 --> 59:09.220
Same rule on Ragnarok, you know, if you don't want to, you know, you don't do War of Imperium

59:09.220 --> 59:10.640
if you're level 10.

59:10.640 --> 59:13.560
Step up or ship out, bitch.

59:13.560 --> 59:17.560
There's a big gap between raiders and non-raiders, and you see that a lot on the forums.

59:17.560 --> 59:23.600
The people who do the big raid instances do better in PvP, it's not much a matter of skill.

59:23.600 --> 59:29.560
I think they should call it World of Warcraft Hardcore Edition for the hardcore.

59:29.560 --> 59:36.760
Also patch 1.12 is going to bring in a new type of Rogue PVP.

59:36.760 --> 59:43.120
You will see Horde and Alliance players trying to gain control of strategic positions.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.820
And Rogues will get a talent review.

59:45.820 --> 59:50.600
To this I say it's about damn time on both counts.

59:50.600 --> 59:55.360
have needed a talent change for a while they just need some tweaks and world PVP

59:55.360 --> 59:58.700
because of battlegrounds because there are actually objectives in

59:58.700 --> 01:00:04.120
battlegrounds has effectively killed off world PVP so both of those need a

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.480
revamp I'm glad they're getting them hmm I you know I'm going back to the price

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.400
for a minute for character transfer I think $25 is fair actually they agree

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.720
because it makes sure the people really want to do it and it's not just people

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.760
taking advantage of it because even if it was $5 I think $25 means that it's

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.400
only people who really want to be with their friends and really want to do it

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.280
you know because otherwise I think this would just be happening left and right

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.160
and it would just get too confusing and all this stuff so I'm kind I'm glad I

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.480
think it's a smart idea and I think I think Final Fantasy 11 badly needs to

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.000
implement something similar honestly but that's just my opinion what do I know

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:47.360
was that a dark soccer I'm sorry doesn't okay then I guess then we'll give the

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.020
microphone back to Loki so he can do his next story. Thank you very much. In between the

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:55.800
porn surfing, what are you doing over there, Loki? I'm not searching for porn. Sure. I'm

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.980
trying to get my program newsletter to work because it's not, it wants me to buy it. Alright.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.040
Don't want to. Anyways, um, although if you don't want to buy stuff and you want to save

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.000
some money, well you're still going to have to buy stuff, but if you want to save some

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.960
money on some 360 games, try maybe buying region free games. Like for example, stuff

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:20.960
from PlayAsia. They're offering MotoGP 2006 which just came out in the 360 for $59.99

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:27.680
here in the States. You can buy it actually, the Asian version for $39.99. Guess what?

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.920
It's region free, you can play it on your system. So you actually save 20 bucks. So

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:38.840
that's kind of neat. And they actually have a few games that are like that. Not sure if

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.120
they're going to change that in the future, but something to look into if you're thinking

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.560
about buying games or buy yous like I do.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:51.040
We're not going to open up our skype line over at www.orangelandsradio.com, click on

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.040
interact with us.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.880
However, I wish to announce here for our fourth birthday some pretty major changes with the

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.720
skype line and just kind of our reasonings why we're doing it.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.040
First off, we here at Orange Lawns Radio do not like to edit the show unless we absolutely

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.120
have to.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.400
We would never edit out someone's opinion on anything.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.960
The only thing we edit out are complete fuck-ups like when we forget to start the show right

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.400
or whatever, the story is not up that we need, or what have you.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.200
And now though, we're going to start editing out Skype calls that are not up to a certain

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:26.240
quality standard, and we don't want to scare you guys off from calling in.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.720
That's not what we're trying to do.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.920
We're never going to censor your opinions, but the problem is just based on some feedback

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.680
that we're getting from folks that are listening to the show and posting on the forums and

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.580
talking to friends is that unfortunately some of the quality calls we just can't afford

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:42.880
to keep leaving in the show because it's kind of starting to bring the show down.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:49.540
So please guys, before you call in using Skype, please use Echo 1-2-3 to call in first to

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:55.860
make sure your connection is okay or pick up the phone and call 916-226-9067 if you

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:59.260
are the person that pays the bill because that's probably a toll call.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:03.580
Now that being said, the phone isn't always 100% efficient, especially if you're using

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.760
a cell phone.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.180
Please don't be offended if we hang up on you due to quality control issues.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:12.420
Just for the betterment of the show try again next week or leave us a voicemail

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:19.180
Orange launch radio is on all the time on Skype and you can actually call in leave us a voicemail and actually

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:24.980
What I'd like to know your opinions on this week for the voicemail. We're gonna start making this a regular segment

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.980
I would really like to hear your voicemails later

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:32.020
actually, I'll give you the topic after the Skype calls because then otherwise people want to call in and talk about it, but we're gonna

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.020
have like a

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:38.760
weekly topic to call in about. So anyway, let's go to the phone's Skype line and

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.160
see what you guys have to say.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? It's Ranma. Can you hear me now?

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:50.760
Of course I can hear you. What's up, Ranma? What's on your mind? Not much. I've probably recovered from Anime Next last weekend.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.960
From Anime Next? How was that? It was fun, but there was a lot of drama with the

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.760
game room, but I'll save that for later.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.400
Well, no, I want to hear it. What was the drama in the game room? Have you heard of desktop arcade?

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.680
Yes. They were banned from AnimeNext.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.200
Wow, what did they do? They were at Fonome. What did they do? A desktop arcade, they're the ones that make the

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.440
popping music controllers and the beat media controllers, right?

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.520
Ooh, what'd they do? I wanna know. It seems that somebody stole their passes from last year,

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.320
photocopied them, and went into the game room. And it seems that the guy who

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.720
runs the game room, Kevin, who's also known as Assembler,

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.040
who owns Assembler.org, basically blacklisted them from the con.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.440
and whenever you mention it on the forums about why they weren't there

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.680
he will go in and edit your post and delete it as if it never existed

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.720
that's a little weird that's almost a little too hardcore they didn't post

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.400
anything like why they're gone or whatever

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.520
nope every time you ask them why or whatever

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.080
your post is deleted that's freaky that's like a KGB thing

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.800
I came very close to getting banned on the forums when I stopped because if I got banned

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.520
I know senior staffs that would probably have his head on a fucking platter

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.480
should we call make a call to desktop arcade get one of them on the show try

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.520
to get their side of the story

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.840
sure why not I can arrange that open it you know what open invite you tell him

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.160
we want him I'd love to hear it

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.000
wouldn't you guys? I am, I see you guys, alright let's hear it

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.560
anyway sorry buddy what what else is going on in anime next? it was pretty fun

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.600
um it was hot as hell but luckily my hotel was like

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.080
15 feet away from Expo Center it was huge it was great

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.400
The only thing that really sucked was the acoustics.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.880
Hmm, what was wrong with the acoustics? Just, you know,

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.920
hard to hear things and sound bouncing everywhere or what?

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:39.160
Yes, think of it as a giant warehouse and they were dividing everything

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.720
with these heavy curtains.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.040
What kind of cool video game related things did you see there? I know it's a

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.860
lot of anime, but since we're a gaming show, what kind of cool video game things did you see there?

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.040
Not too much, because I went into the game room,

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.640
the funk just hit me and I passed out. But I did!

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.360
I did go into the dealers room. I did see some DS lights on imports white

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.840
PSP's

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.840
Okay, so a lot of import games

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:11.160
Ranma, yes, I was actually hanging out with my friend Julie yesterday and she's going to anime Expo this year

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.060
Yeah, I have no the only reason I see to go there this year's cuz clamps there

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.360
Yeah, I want to go but my wizard costume is not done

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:23.520
Well, she's talking about buying some of those miniature bottles of Febreze to go around

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.440
spraying the fanboy funk.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.120
I will praise her if she does that.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.560
Allow us to take this opportunity, boys and girls, to remind you, when you are of a certain

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:37.120
age, it is critically important, and actually you really should do this when you're a child,

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.000
and if you're old enough to figure out how to download the show and listen to it and

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.320
all that fun stuff, you are probably this age.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:47.920
It is important that you bathe on a regular basis, that you use soap to clean the germs

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.040
off your body, and that you use something like deodorant, cologne, I don't know, something

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:57.520
to make sure that you're going to smell unoffensive when you're in a room tightly packed, especially

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.740
a hot room, as Rama's telling us, this con was pretty hot, around all these people.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:08.140
So please, don't give gamers a bad name, such as these folks at Anime Next that were stinking

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:15.460
up the room, bathe regularly, and, you know, bring the smell of flowers into gaming rooms

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.460
everywhere.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:23.600
And I knew a person, I actually met somebody at Anime Expo a few years ago who actually

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.200
was one of those, I'm going to sleep in the lobby of the hotel or in the movie room type

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:36.040
people, only he actually would go into the men's room and clean himself at the sink.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.640
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, Bandit in the chat room has the best idea ever for a

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.640
cosplay.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.880
Someone should dress up as a big bottle of Febreze.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:51.880
There's one for you. One anime con when they passed out their registration bags had little bars of soap in each of the bags.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.880
And don't you know the people got pissed off and offended.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.880
I would actually like to quote my friend Megzi.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.880
Okay.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.880
Hobo. Horrible otaku body odor.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:09.880
Why would you be offended at that? I look at it as a free gift. People fucking steal hotel soap all the time.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.880
You know what I say the cons should do?

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.880
What?

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:23.880
They should have an anonymous shower room. Take one of the hotel rooms, someone just stands there with a sheet, you go in, sign in, take your shower, and leave. 100% anonymous.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:31.880
Wow. Alright, anyway, we gotta wrap this up so we can get to another call, but any other thoughts on the cons or gaming or what have you?

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.880
It was fun, overall. I'm gonna post a couple of links and that's it. The first one's for Jamie.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:41.880
Ron would have cosplay in full effect. There was a bunch of Ron would have cosplays running around.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.560
Alright. Alright, thank you very much, Rama, for the call. I appreciate it, okay?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.760
Sure. No problem.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.640
Later, buddy.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.120
Later.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.320
We always like it when he calls in.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.240
DMN, I need some ATH points to Bandit. I know it's your contest, but Bandit,

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.520
come on. That was some points right there. Let's go to another phone call.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.360
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.600
Hi, Skye. It's Ravenstaufen.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.200
Hey, Ravenstaufen. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.640
Phoenix Wright.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.120
Phoenix Wright. You know, I've kind of looked at this game a little bit. It's kind of neat.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.420
What what if you just recently started playing this game?

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:19.340
Sort of I bought it for a week and I found it in EB for 30 bucks and it it rocks really

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.960
What do you lucky you what do you like about Phoenix, right?

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:29.220
Well, I just like that. The music is great when you have nailed someone it goes like objection you did this

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:35.860
Okay, wait a meek Latov just walked in the room. So I've got to put him on the spot here meek Latov. You've been playing

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.300
Phoenix right turn finished it. What did you think of that?

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.820
What do you love so much about the game? It's like playing law and order

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:48.220
That's pretty much what I like and it's funny. It's really really funny. Well, what's so funny about it?

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.380
There's nothing funny about law

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:55.980
The writing is really hilarious and the names they come up with for the characters like Lotta Hart and

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.440
Somebody von Karma. I forget his yeah

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:04.820
Manfred von Karma and it was seriously like the evil voice, right?

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:05.820
Right?

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.820
OBJECTION!

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.220
It's, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.100
I have all these other games I was playing too, and I was like, I'm not taking this out

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.100
of my DS.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.980
It just seems to me like that game has an awful lot of reading though, so what keeps

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.380
this game kind of interesting?

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.380
Skye.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.380
Yes, Raven's Dolphin.

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.900
Uh, because it has a lot of reading, I read pretty well, I don't, I can't read a book,

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.900
but I can read games.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.900
Well, it's not like I can't read, Raven's Dolphin, but if I want to read, I'll read

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.900
a book.

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.940
It's an engaging story, each chapter, so it's not like you want to put it down.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:37.040
I mean I've heard a lot of great things about the game, so it's just when I was kind of watching you play it

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.060
I was kind of like this looks like a lot of reading for a video game. I can understand that but then again

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:45.180
You know what so is final fan any of the Super Nintendo Final Fantasy so you had to read a lot in those games

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:50.860
Too really, so I'm let's slide two words about Phoenix, right that will sell it to anyone Mike Meekins

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.380
You will find out once you play through it Mike Meekins

01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:02.020
Oh, it took him a minute ravens often Meekins is what they're making another one for the DS called justice for all

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:07.060
That's all I wanted to call for I'm getting that launch day, and there's a Phoenix coming out, right?

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:13.020
Okay, thank you, just tell us real quick wait before you go back. How does it work in Japan?

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.860
There's the different games in Japan how many are out in Japan and what's been translated over here three on Gameboy Advance?

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.500
And then they're making a new one on DS 4 and it doesn't have Phoenix right in it anymore

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:28.260
At least that we know of so far. It's a different attorney this time. Hmm and

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:37.260
And what's really cool is my coworker, she wasn't able to get the American one, but they just re-released the Japanese one in Japan.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.260
And it has a... of course they released it in Japan if it's Japanese.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:44.260
Yeah, you can toggle between English or Japanese in the game.

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:51.260
So if you can't find it in America right now, you can go on an import site and just get that re-release of the Japanese one.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:53.260
You can still play it in English.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.260
Awesome.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:59.160
Ravis Dolphin, any other thoughts there on Phoenix Riot or gaming in general?

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.840
What was the worst game you ever played in your life?

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.260
I can tell you mine. It was Deadly Towers for the Nest. That game was horrible.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:16.920
Worst game I've ever played in my life. Oh my gosh.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.480
Do you remember

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.760
Color Dreams?

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.340
Which was a company that created these games on the NES that were in those like really colored cartridges.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.320
They made a game called Master Chew and the Drunk Nerd Who.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.320
Where you're basically ghost busting.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.320
It's fucking horrible. What?

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.320
Where you're like basically ghost busting. I can't even remember.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.320
I don't even remember. I just remember.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:40.820
It was bad.

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.820
Running this game and being like 10 years old and going like, what a crap.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.820
How about this one? The NES version of X-Men.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.820
Yeah, that was horrible.

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:52.820
That was awful!

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.820
Or most people would say...

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.820
The Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man.

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:57.820
Oh god.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.820
Or E.T.

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.820
E.T. was worse.

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.820
Superman 64.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:07.820
I hate to be trendy here and kind of saying what everybody else says, but honestly, dude,

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.820
Wand of Gamelon, Zelda, fucking horrible.

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:11.820
I'm sorry.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.820
I got to play it at Classic Gaming Expo.

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:14.820
It really is that bad.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.820
I'm sorry for you, Sky.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.820
You had to play that.

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.980
I had to because I feel like it's like my journalistic responsibility,

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.720
you know, I know you're laughing at the term journalist, but I feel like it's my

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.320
responsibility to listeners of the show to play that game at least once and see

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.600
if it really is as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:36.160
It is really that bad and I'm sure you can even download the movies on YouTube

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.560
and that doesn't even begin

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.160
just because the gameplay itself is horrible. I mean, what was Nintendo thinking

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.280
letting these guys just

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.480
poop on the Link franchise? These guys literally shit on Link.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.280
Okay, now that you're our guinea pig, go play Big Rigs.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.560
I would rather not. They crapped on Mario to

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.760
Mario's Hotel? That was horrible. Oh god, yadda yadda yadda.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.560
Alright, Ravenstaufen, thanks for the question. Actually, there's another game that I thought was

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.400
pretty awful. What's that?

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.040
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. I would- I hate you.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.480
I wouldn't put it in worst game ever though, because- It's not worst game ever,

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.560
however, it shouldn't have carried the Final Fantasy name because it was way too much of a

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.000
child's game. Okay, okay.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.640
It fit the niche that it was designed for, though. It was an entry-level RPG.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:23.280
Right, but you're right. A, it shouldn't have been Final Fantasy. What I will give that game, though, is that it actually has a pretty kick-ass soundtrack.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.560
Yeah. All things considered. I mean, whoever did... I know it was a female that did the music there, and I think she

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.840
came over to... I could be wrong, but I think she made some of the music in XI.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.960
I might be wrong. Don't quote me on that. But it's got a great soundtrack, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.280
You know, now that I think about it, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest would probably have fit in better

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.600
had they called it a saga. Not Romancing Saga, but

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:48.780
Saga yeah, that's what I think I because honestly it wasn't ever a Final Fantasy. That's great because all the other saga games are shit

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.440
No, they're not. Hey, I can't I don't like the saw games at all. I guess I got friends here, too

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.700
Sorry, I got three. I don't yes. I got I'm sorry. We're missing saga too, but I think saga 3 2 yeah

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.260
but I

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:06.580
Agree, it was a good entry-level RPG, but honestly it doesn't need to have the Final Fantasy name on it in the u.s

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:10.860
What was the most recent saga game they put out on ps2? Wasn't it like unlimited or something?

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:16.440
Yeah, that game is one of the worst games I've ever played in my life. It's it's awful. No

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.820
The remake of romance Raven's Dolphin ping pals

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:26.860
Gee, oh that was horrible boss that I bought a new copy wrong or I mean

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.420
I feel sorry cuz I know somebody gave it to me as a gift, but it really is a bad game

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:36.620
Play burnout legends on the DS you'll cry. All right. Anyway, um, I gotta let you go rave this off

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:40.340
We got to keep moving on the show. Thank you so much. This is way too long. All right. Appreciate it buddy

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.340
Have a good one. No, he just hung up

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.820
Appreciate the call

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:49.700
Alright, let's do one more call. Hi. You're on Orange Lodge radio. Who's this? It's the one and only legend of Zaku

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.220
Hi legend of Zaku. What's on your mind, buddy? Um

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:59.820
Coney Island just got supernova last Friday. Um, and it started trickle. It started trickle down on the East Coast from what I'm hearing

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:03.020
So what are your impressions of DDR Supernova after playing it, which I imagine you have?

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:10.380
Um, for one thing, we seem to agree that it might be a beta cab,

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:13.740
because after comparing it to the one in Jersey Gardens, which I happened to play,

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.340
which was a location test, there was a lot of differences in it.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.980
First of all, certain songs were coming in very early.

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.820
You know, in other words, there was early timing on songs such as You're Not Here.

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:28.140
The pads, you know, were really stiff, obviously, because they're brand new.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:34.440
besides that you know a lot of things that are just you know just the fact

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:39.560
that uh not really I'm trying to think right now it's just we're not sure if

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:44.280
this is it because you know I this is saying it looks to me like it's the same

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:49.400
build that I played before okay is that good thumbs up thumbs down thumbs middle

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.680
it's all it's so and so I just hope Konami's playing that you know I hope

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.480
Konami's playing the cards right because if this is the final version god help us

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:02.280
all. Why? Just because of the early timings and stuff? No, it's just because of the fact

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.120
that it's really, you know, it's harder to get perfects now, it's harder to get double

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:10.360
A's, because the timing window is really tight now. Well, I thought people were bitching

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.300
that DDR was too easy, all the In the Groove fans were bitching it was too easy. No, but

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:20.120
I think they OD'd on the timing window. At first it started to be too loose, and now

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.120
it's starting to be too tight. I guess it should have been right there in the middle.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:27.640
interesting but besides that

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.200
well what's the bit what's been the general because I imagine these arcades

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.160
are packed what's the general fan consensus that you're picking up are

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.040
people happy to see a new DDR game back in arcades

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.880
yeah or people bitching on these little nuts

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.920
they're not bitching so or so to say they just so

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.920
they really don't know what to believe whether or not they their betas are real

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.600
and the only we're gonna find that out is the second location in New York City

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.720
when it's set up tomorrow

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.120
which is in Chinatown.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.480
Well, we'll be eagerly awaiting a forum post letting us know.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.240
Actually, I'm going to link you to one right now.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.320
I'm going to link you to a thread that actually showed

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.520
the reaction from New Yorkers about the

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.520
supernova setup in Toney Island. And that's in our chat room over at

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.880
orangelaunchradio.com. Click on chat. I don't have time to read it right now

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.120
because we're trying to do a show,

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.700
but I'll check it out later.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:19.800
Alright, just keep in mind that Konami is just fooling around with the whole

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.160
the whole release date thing, so I really don't know what to believe right now.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.880
I don't know whether, as I said, I don't know whether these are betas, or is this the final

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.880
thing?

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.880
It's up in the air right now.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.760
What else are people playing in New York City besides DDR?

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:36.540
Just hacked in, just stuff like In The Groove and stuff.

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:37.540
You know, regular...

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.000
Is that all people do in New York is dance?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Huh?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.520
Is that all people do in New York is dance?

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.900
Nah, but they do other things like, you know, in Chinatown they play fighting games, but

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.160
you know, they have lives to live as well.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.840
It's something we do on the side.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.720
Zaco, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.720
Alright.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.720
Thanks so much for the call.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.720
Okay.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.720
Later.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.720
Bye.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.720
Bye.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720
Oh, I gotta let this call through.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.720
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.720
Who's this?

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.720
This is Bandit.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.720
Hi, Bandit.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.200
You know, you won points earlier, so I decided to take one more call, because I saw it was

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.200
you.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200
What's on your mind?

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200
Thanks, yeah.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.200
I appreciate that.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.200
I think he wasn't giving me points anyways.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.200
Jerk.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.200
Alright.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200
I'll take him.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.200
That's his Wii.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200
Yeah.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.200
Alright.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.920
He was complaining about the timing window.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.640
The only thing they did differently is they just made the marvelous timing the perfect

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.640
timing now.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.960
Supposedly from the post I've been reading, that's all they did.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:38.280
But I mean Bandit, I asked Zaku this and I'll ask you this, weren't most DDR players that

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:42.840
went over to In the Groove or whatever claiming, and honestly guys just play both and enjoy

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.480
both, but weren't people that went over to In the Groove kind of complaining that the

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:50.960
The difficulty was too easy on DDR, which is kind of why they wanted a harder game like

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.960
In the Groove.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.160
And now that Konami's went and made the game harder, they're upset.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:58.600
Well, I've argued with so many people about this.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.480
A lot of people went to ITG just because they thought there weren't going to be a new DDR

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.620
coming out.

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:09.040
Then they complained about the difficulty in DDR, or not being hard enough.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.360
It's not because of the grading, it's because of the actual step charts of the song that

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.340
I keep getting people complaining to me about.

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:18.500
They're always like, oh, this step chart's not hard enough, or this isn't like this and

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.580
that on In the Groove, and they keep comparing it back and forth.

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:28.700
Well, if they got to remember, there wouldn't be any ITG without DDR first.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.700
That's true.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.700
That's true.

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:35.740
There are harder step charts in DDR now, so unless they're triple A-ing everything, I

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:36.740
don't want to hear any complaints.

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:42.220
I don't want to hear any of this stuff again.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.220
Do you live in an area where Supernova is on its way or what?

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.540
I live in Pittsburgh.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.540
We didn't get one yet.

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.540
It's on its way, though.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.540
Alright.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:56.220
Well, Bandit, thanks so much for calling in and giving your perspective on Supernova.

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.220
I appreciate it.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.220
Alright, man.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.220
Thanks for the points.

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.540
Well, no problem.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:05.420
I'm getting razzed for that in the chat room now because apparently I've ruffled the panties

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:09.820
of DMN and he's a little upset now because I was arguing with him whether he should have

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:13.860
points or not and I should I should just keep my big fat opinion out of it and

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.380
let him run his contest. Just keep on leeching points for me ya

01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:22.660
bastard. Alright Bandit have a good one. Alright you guys do this then. Alright bye.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:27.740
Yes I realize DMN does not have to be doing a contest I am very grateful he

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.060
already knows that but I still have to give him shit because that's what I do

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:34.360
on this program is I give our chatters shit but know that I do that because I

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:40.120
love you very much last minute stories boys and girls anything final you guys

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.440
want to bring up actually I do mm-hmm one of my friends on live journal links

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:52.440
this story on Kotaku it was there's a contest going on through July where if

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:58.800
you buy a copy of Tetris during that a time period and register the cereal at

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:05.800
Club Nintendo you can choose to battle Utada Hikaru or get concert tickets.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:11.800
There's 30 people will be chosen to play against her and 504 pairs of tickets

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:18.440
will be given out. Now the thing is though is that they there's a video of

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.960
her playing and it's actually up on YouTube. She completely owns this guy. She

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.720
She plays really really well

01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:35.920
You can either see the movie file up on Kotaku or you can check it out do a search on YouTube, but

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:43.180
Yeah, she's really good at Tetris. DMN is putting out a challenge right there. He says I'll fuck up Utada. I

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:50.140
Think that's a Tetris DS challenge in the making right there. Oh sign up. It's on the gauntlet's been thrown down

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:53.800
Utada if you're listening I would love to I would love to play her because

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.280
actually the thing I noticed she plays Tetris the same way I do which is you

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:04.120
know build up for the for the four line and it keeps hopping up you just you

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:08.120
know even them out to where you have the full four lines down it down the next

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.840
one that's exactly that's exactly how I play Tetris so that would be very fun I

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:19.840
Now that's a girl gamer. Well done. Anything last minute? Anybody else?

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:35.840
Yeah, there was something interesting I should point out. It was pointed out that 99 Nights, one of the things that happens to be on Microsoft's site, I believe, is showing the product info for 99 Nights.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.840
And it's interesting because it says hard drive required.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.840
One of the things that I thought Microsoft was not going to do

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.840
with their games is require you to have a hard drive. And such an anticipated

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.840
game too, ouch. So all of those

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.840
out there that don't have a hard drive, you're kind of fucked.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.840
Unless this pans out to be just a mistake or something, but that's pretty...

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.840
Well they had that one, was it Football Manager or something like that that required the hard drive.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:09.160
I'm thinking this is the way they're going why they're releasing the 256 megabyte card then is beyond me

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.520
Just lower the price of the hard drive or release a larger hard drive

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:17.600
I don't know, but it has hard drive required and hard drive enhanced as two of the things on there

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
So I thought that was interesting

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.240
Who knows

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.000
Interesting anything else last minute you guys

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.400
No

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:36.640
There is another thing also I had Genesis collection is coming to PlayStation 2 and the PSP

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:45.320
It's gonna have a collection of old Genesis games 28 of them and with the additional three being unlocked

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:53.420
Including shinobi to Sonic the Hedgehog golden axe 1 2 & 3 virtual fighter 2 altered beast

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.220
echo the dolphin and fancy star

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.800
rise from your grave

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.920
Alright, well

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.980
then I guess that's gonna do it for tonight's show. We're just about wrapped up here, but

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:09.300
we want to go around first and get everybody's final thought. It's been a long

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.700
second half tonight, but that's alright. It's our birthday. We can go long if we want.

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.760
Loki, I'm sorry, actually Magus, I'll start with you. Thank you very much for being

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.180

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:22.020

Final thought? I got sex appeal because I dual wield.

01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:48.620
Nerd. Loki, your final thought? I want to play this game Cinco no Ronde

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:53.640

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.120
head hurts must run ice cube ice cube shampoo would be great right now for my

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.000
