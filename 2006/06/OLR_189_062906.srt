Orange, Lounge, Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loko

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tonight, the PlayStation 3 gets a website, Prey gets a release date, and what is the Wii hiding under that little flap?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:36,960
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,320
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gamer news and gamer culture as well.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,440
My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,860
You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,920
Joining me as always, say hello to the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Rawr!

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
How you doing?

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Rawr!

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Rawr!

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Angst!

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Are you on your period or something?

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
No!

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
I had to work all day.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Oh, I know.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I know.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,740
Today is a bit of a special edition of Orange Laundry, but I'll get into that in a moment.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,400
Also say hello, though, first to Tech Master Loki.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Hi.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Hi.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
There you go.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Hi.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Now we can hear you.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
What are you looking at over there on the laptop?

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,440
You've been staring intently there for, like, trying to confirm something.

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,080
Oh, one of the stories we're doing tonight?

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,400
Yes, it's quite important.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
All right.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,080
Anyways, we are a bit of a special episode this week.

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,920
There is only going to be one part of this week's episode.

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,380
There's not going to be a part A and part B. The reason for that is that we're taping

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,840
far in advance this week.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,300
It's actually Thursday evening when we're taping this week's show, partially because

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,160
I'm fleeing the country tomorrow.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm going to be gone for just under a week.

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,960
So we're pre-taping our live show on Thursday night.

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
We are live, if anybody is listening to our regular live stream, we are here, we're in

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
in our chat room, which is on a brand new server, might I add.

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,300
We're on a brand new chat server.

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,880
All the details are over at orangelaunchradio.com.

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,000
We've moved from other side IRC to Game Surge.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
But for those of you guys that just go to Orange Launch Radio,

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,360
click on Chat, and use the Java, you won't see a change at all.

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,720
It'll just take you right on into the new chat room.

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,640
So if anybody is listening live on Thursday,

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,100
we do, of course, value your input, as always.

49
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,840
But we're not expecting quite the turnout

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,560
in the live interaction that we usually get.

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,540
But we still have a lot of gaming news to get into.

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,560
There's been a lot that's happened so far this week

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
and we want to cover it for you guys.

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,400
But first, a little bit about us.

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,480
My gaming week was a lot of Dead or Alive 4.

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,160
A lot of it, as in, that's all everybody played

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,720
when I got home from work yesterday.

59
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,760
My husband's cousin and his girlfriend were over

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,440
and then other people showed up

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,160
and so it was pinball slash Dead or Alive best

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,100
all in our house.

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,380
and I played a, tried to play a little Warcraft and I'm gonna probably start on

64
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,460
whatever server that is that you're on.

65
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,260
I'll say it, it's my airy peak, because you would never guess who my

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,420
character is on there, but

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,860
I'll tell you, obviously. I'll set that up tonight. Awesome.

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,420
I think. I'll get you in touch with Miklotov, who'll get you in our guild too.

69
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,220
It'll rock. He's our guild master. Okay, don't expect me to go on any raids or anything.

70
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,900
Oh, please. You make it sound like we're all level 60 already.

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,620
Did my well I'll do it during my gaming week, but I had a warcraft II week, too

72
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,200
Let's put it that way. Oh, and I also played Animal Crossing during a meeting at work

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,360
Okay, not have been very important me

74
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,240
No, it was basically just to give a little overview the company I work for was purchased by another company

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,080
Yeah, fun, and they want to keep us they want to keep everybody it was good

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,660
But they're all like they just announced it like the day before we're having this big HR meeting and crap

77
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
So me and Julie...

78
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Or was everybody doing the panicky, oh my god, Zwoggin, Pink Slips...

79
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
They're asking stupid questions. We all knew.

80
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,660
They were reading off of the same stuff that was on the website at work.

81
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,660
And then, oh, we can't answer that at this time.

82
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Oh, we don't know the answer to this at this time.

83
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,660
Oh, I'm sure information will be available as, you know, that type of crap.

84
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,660
So me and customi19 and another one of our co-worker friends

85
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,660
were sitting in the back and our friend was reading a book and we were playing Animal Crossing.

86
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,860
We were sitting on the floor behind people.

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
You guys are going to get fired?

88
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
No.

89
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,100
She's been there longer than I have.

90
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,140
She actually trained me at my job.

91
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
So yeah.

92
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,140
Alright.

93
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,340
Wait, I wanted to ask why all the dead are alive for?

94
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,380
Because it was on when I came home.

95
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,380
It was on!

96
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,780
It's on!

97
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,540
And although...

98
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,820
Bouncy boobs, it's what's on the tube.

99
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,900
girlfriend though she's like really good at the game and she was completely Dan's

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,860
best friend Eric she's completely kicking his ass and he's such a masher

101
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,220
Dan got pissed off is like why did you actually do a move? Dead or Alive 4 is not

102
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,300
a game he can get away with button mashing in. Somehow Eric pulls it off

103
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,940
but Dan's like okay okay I want you to call a move and do it cuz Eric's like I

104
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,020
knew all the moves in the game and he couldn't do a single one it was funny

105
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,260
like in Tekken who is it I want to say like Tekken 3 I remember it was Eddie

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:10,580
You could totally get away with back mashing. However, if you lose without mashing. Yeah, then it was like even better

107
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,660
Yeah, but yeah, he's he's the mashers character. Yeah, and what was in Tekken 4 it was a girl

108
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,340
Christy Christy, that's right. It was like his student or some gotcha. I

109
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,100
Played with Horong anyway, but you can also mash with him to love it a little bit, but mine was always Jen and Julia

110
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,060
I'll never forget old school. You won't get old school button mashing

111
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,060
When I used to play Street Fighter 2 back in the day, like when I was high, yes, E. Honda, exactly.

112
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Wow, that's crazy, yes, because all you had to do was hit the buttons a bunch, he did that hand thing.

113
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
How did she move?

114
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
Though he had also had the charging stuff too.

115
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Oh yeah.

116
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,060
It was the same deal with Blanca, just, let's shoot, let's shoot, let's shoot, arrgh!

117
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,060
Chun Li did the feet thing too.

118
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
Yeah.

119
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,060
The old days of cheese.

120
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,060
Did I ever tell you about the time?

121
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
I don't know how old I was.

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
Story time, what's up?

123
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,340
I know okay. It's it's a weird show this week. Who cares? We're allowed

124
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,420
Um, I think I was about 16 years old and I was randomly in Southern, California

125
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,460
We were at some comic book shop like after hours and they had a Street Fighter 2 machine because you remember what Street Fighter 2

126
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,580
Is huge you could find these machines in the weirdest places like you'd find them in the back of comic book stores

127
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,660
You'd find them in quickie March. You'd find them everywhere, right and

128
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,180
I played that game and I wasn't a huge Street Fighter player

129
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:32,460
But I was on that game and I was kicking all these guys asses with Chun Li for like an hour straight and then finally

130
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,740
some girl came up and also used Chun Li and

131
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:43,320
Worked me. I mean she own me. I'll never forget her. Although. Well, I don't remember her name, but you know

132
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,780
My days of massive massive pwnage on fighting games. I have three major milestones

133
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,660
Okay, one of them was we had this guy in Alabama

134
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,980
his name was Jay guy was like the best ever fighting game player in the

135
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,700
universe especially on anything Capcom and I'd managed to beat him on Dark

136
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,820
Stalkers once and that was the happiest day of my life and then it was me and my

137
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,700
friend Marcy we were like the killer instinct people we would trade off and

138
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,340
just like own guys all day and then I told the story many times my Tekken 3

139
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,860
Re-escapade at a cyber station in Mobile, Alabama

140
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,620
At the L'air mall. Oh, yeah, I got in there. Yeah, you told us on the show before I think yeah

141
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,740
These guys have been in there playing from like 10 a.m. To 2 in the afternoon doing nothing but King playing his

142
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,740
Throws over and over so I was like I want to play so I shoved one of them off the machine and played Julia and

143
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,300
Kept beating them because she has the combo block the throw block

144
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,740
Killer instinct my god. I'm forever. I really want to play that game

145
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,480
I'm like right now and then killer instinct 2 came out when I was when I lived in the dorms

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,000
So we would go over to the bark. It was like a bar deli arcade

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,120
What we would just play killer instinct to you all night. What was the name of the?

148
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Skeleton guy because that was a guy I always used. I know sad. I don't remember the name, but I know who you mean spinal

149
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Yes, spinal

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll never forget that combo breaker. I

151
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
Yeah, all right

152
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,020
Loki, how was your gaming week?

153
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,860
It was okay. I played a little bit more of

154
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,980
Blazing Angels. I'm almost finished with that game now finally.

155
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,380
It's funny though because all the achievements kind of get unlocked at the same time.

156
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,460
Like you get an achievement for if you ace all the missions you get something

157
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,020
then as you finish the game I think your rank ends up being like

158
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,980
corporal or whatever it needs to be and then all the medals. So if you ace all the

159
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,380
missions you unlock like four achievements.

160
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,820
at the same time which is most the achievements in the game anyways

161
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,620
so yeah I'm trying to beat this game for achievements

162
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,940
pretty much it points or and then

163
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,460
I've been playing the ChromeHounds demo

164
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,220
and that was pretty fun I thought that wasn't released in the US

165
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,700
wait you have a account somewhere else don't you

166
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,500
maybe it's okay I mean everybody knows you can get an account in another country

167
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,460
You just set up an account for Japan. Once you download it you can play it with any account,

168
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,900
so. That's cool. It's stupid. It's all in English anyways. Isn't there a 99 Nights demo

169
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,860
in Japan? No. I thought there was. There's Love Football, and that's about it. That's

170
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,220
the only other demo that we don't have. But still though, I mean, it's all in English.

171
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,780
I mean completely. Even the JEP, you know, you can select different languages I guess

172
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,260
initially or whatever, but it's all in English. So there's, I don't understand why they didn't

173
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,220
release it over here. It's stupid, but whatever, you can still get it.

174
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,780
Well, you know on Major Nelson's blog earlier this week, he talked about, you know, why,

175
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,660
or there's like an FAQ, why don't things come to certain regions, and it's always like licensing,

176
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,020
permission, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, all that stuff.

177
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,740
It's the internet, it doesn't matter, they're downloading off your servers.

178
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,380
Obviously people are getting it anyway, so it doesn't matter.

179
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,460
Yeah, exactly, what's the matter?

180
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,420
Now a lot of the feedback I read on the demo was really negative, but you enjoyed it?

181
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,600
Just because they're stupid and they don't understand, they think that these mechs represent

182
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,640
all the mechs in the game, they're slow.

183
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,640
The mechs are heavy mechs that move slow.

184
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,080
It's not like speed racer mechs.

185
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,100
No, you can make lighter mechs that are faster or you have these heavier mechs which are

186
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,280
damn slow.

187
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,860
And that's the two missions, there's a sniping mission and like a soldier mission and they're

188
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,080
both with heavy mechs and they're like, these mechs move so slow, it took me 15 days to

189
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
turn around.

190
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,960
It's supposed to move slow because it's armored as hell.

191
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,120
You can get a light mech or a mech with hovercraft, bottom, or wheels, or whatever, and it moves

192
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
fast.

193
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,000
Tonight's story time on Orange Knowledge Radio, but I don't give a shit.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,600
Did you ever play a Dave & Buster's The Mech game they have there?

195
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,720
I played it back when it was at BattleTech in Virtual World.

196
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,120
I played it when it was over at American Life.

197
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,000
Those things were really slow, but it was fun.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Exactly.

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I mean, because...

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I beg to differ.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,040
Well, yeah, but you get you get motion sick and that's a whole nother Oprah

202
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,640
But you know, um, if you didn't have that you would you wouldn't you agree that the game is somewhat fun

203
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,880
At least if it's what okay. There you go

204
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
anyway

205
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,700
So yeah, it's it's a fun game. I liked it and the multiplayer is gonna be awesome. They've got

206
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
with the online

207
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:35,000
Things gonna have like a perpetual war that's going on so you can jump in and out of this war at any time and just

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,120
earn points. It's kind of like conquest mode in Soulcalibur but just always going on. And

209
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,640
then that's just one part of the multiplayer. Or you can do team matches and all that stuff.

210
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,440
And one of the, what's kind of neat though is one of the, like the commander I guess

211
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,160
of the team, you have like full view of the map and you can see where everybody is and

212
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,480
you have to issue commands over your headset to other people so they know where to go and

213
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
stuff because they don't see the whole map. So I think that's kind of neat. They're doing

214
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,040
a lot of things with this and this is kind of positioning itself to be like the next

215
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,920
you know uh... mech assault

216
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,180
you know game and that's what kind of people are looking for

217
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,160
anything else?

218
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,400
uh... just Grand Theft Auto we've been playing more of that still

219
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,960
finally uh...

220
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,840
in all uh... was it Vice City Stories

221
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,040
uh... had a date now uh... October eighteenth

222
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,640
which is about when the last one came out so I'm not

223
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,480
too surprised but uh...

224
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,100
they better

225
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,000
fix the multiplayer I know they're not because they're fucking lazy but

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,320
They better fix the multiplayer because it's really messed up.

227
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
So playable, but really messed up.

228
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,400
My gaming week was actually not that exciting.

229
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,660
I did mention during Jamie's gaming week I played World of Warcraft and I did do an instance

230
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
this week.

231
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,720
Like, you know, Horde's first instance is always the Ragefire Chasm and so I did that

232
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,940
instance this week and you know, that's fun.

233
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,520
And I'm sure a lot of World of Warcraft veterans are snickering at me going, hi you noob.

234
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,480
It's fun to start over on a new server with a new character, and I only play recreationally

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
anyway.

236
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
It's going to be forever before I ever get to 60.

237
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,960
That's how everybody starts.

238
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
What?

239
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,040
Well, the sad thing is I've been a World of Warcraft player on and off for several months

240
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
now.

241
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,160
It hasn't been a super long time, because I know I talked about it on this program,

242
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,080
but for several months now, on and off, I've never gotten a character past the mid-20s,

243
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,360
because I just have such a tension deficit disorder when it comes to characters and just

244
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
gaming in general.

245
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,040
of that not a whole lot interesting burnout still a lot of burnout and I'm

246
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,280
finding it's kind of hard to get the achievements and burnout I am having a

247
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,400
hard time getting perfects on a lot of those early races but I find that what

248
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,600
you can do is you play a ways and you get the really nice cars then you go

249
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,960
back to the first levels and use the nice cars to beat them yes I forgot one

250
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,000
more part of my week actually go for it because I don't have anything else what

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,920
what's that I was gonna actually bring it and play it on my laptop I've got a

252
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,920
a game an

253
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,220
Advanced copy to review. Mm-hmm going to be doing a review on dragon's lair HD

254
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,920
It will be on

255
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,880
the stuff orange on radio comm blog cool, so

256
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,600
Everyone should keep their eyes posted keep their eyes posted keep their eyes on our board for when I post

257
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,320
Awesome. You were talking about that on last week's show. I know so yeah it arrived

258
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm looking forward to checking that out. She's very nice

259
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,960
Are you gonna let me are you gonna let me play with your copy?

260
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,740
Of course, but I was planning on trying to hook up my laptop to our

261
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,200
Widescreen TV and see how it looked on that. I

262
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,640
see mmm

263
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,080
dragon's lair

264
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,520
All right. Well, let's get into the news who wants to start us off tonight with some news

265
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
You know, I think that I could do that. All right, I'd have to try really hard though

266
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,540
Well, please do well guess what has officially launched?

267
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,540
other than a few ships going out to sea.

268
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,540
No idea.

269
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
The official PS3 site.

270
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,540
Actually, both US and UK.

271
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
I haven't bothered checking every other country.

272
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,540
I assume that it's come out.

273
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:09,540
For the US, though, it is www.us.playstation.com slash ps3.

274
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,540
For UK, it's actually, I guess, it's eu.playstation.com slash ps3.

275
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,740
It's got all the beginning stuff on it.

276
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,860
Any new information at all?

277
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,660
Really just there's the usual.

278
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,260
In Europe it's going to hit on November 17th for 499 euros for the 20 gigabyte model.

279
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,660
There is actually information that both versions are coming out.

280
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,100
Although as far as I think just for the UK, I think it's just the 60 gigabyte version

281
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:49,100
for 549.99 pounds. So not much more than all the E3 fluff we got already. Nope, but the

282
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,920
site's pretty. It's got lots of black on it. But the thing is that I think that the European

283
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,420
site looks just really cool. Ours is sorta, look! It's a Playstation 3! There's this like

284
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,540
sleek black stuff with flash animation and reflection! It's so awesome! Ahh! I can't

285
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:15,260
can't stand it, like a hot dog. What? Eddie is our joke. Oh, I was like, PlayStation 3,

286
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,460
can't stand it. Alright, anyway. Like a hot dog. But yeah. Sorry, I'm still looking at

287
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:28,500
stuff. Anyways, I'm gonna have to mess everything up. Speaking of the PlayStation, this is more

288
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,580
kind of on the PSP though. They're saying that they're going to be able to support up

289
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,040
to 7,000 PlayStation 1 games with the new emulator, which pretty much is every game

290
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
out there.

291
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm like, there were 7,000 PlayStation games?

292
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,980
There were not 7,000 games, there was 7,000 different versions of games, so basically

293
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,780
that's their way of saying they're going to be able to support every single game.

294
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,420
A few holes in that whole statement there.

295
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,180
You know what that sounds like, you remember those old 64-in-1 cartridges that were on

296
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,120
the NES, and like 20 of them were just Contra with different color players?

297
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
All kinds of different hacks.

298
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,040
That's what this sounds like to me when they say 7,000.

299
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,400
Although I personally own a few hundred myself.

300
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,600
Yeah, but still, 7,000?

301
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,080
I think that's what the UK PSP magazine is reporting.

302
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,280
But I would say more around, you know, all the games that were on the system.

303
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,120
You're my only thing about that, though.

304
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,880
The PSP does not have a second analog stick, and the PSP only has one L and one R button.

305
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Yeah, but the very first PS1 controller didn't have an analog stick at all.

306
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,300
Yes, true.

307
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,820
But if it's going to be supporting all the games, there are games that require the analog

308
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:39,060
stick and a lot of those games do use the L1 and L2 buttons.

309
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,580
So that eliminates a lot of that 7,000 there, dumbasses, friggin promising the world figure

310
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,580
away.

311
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,340
But they do have a good selection of stuff that they are promising.

312
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,180
These are going to be available when they launch.

313
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,740
Jumping Flash, Jumping Flash.

314
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,860
Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, Silent Hill and Tomb

315
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,860
Raider.

316
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,380
I don't really want to see another Tomb Raider since they were doing the remake anyways

317
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,140
and Tomb Raider sucks. Well, you know, it was a groundbreaking

318
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,980
Tomb Raider Legends was actually fairly decent. That's the new one, right?

319
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,220
I didn't like it at all. I didn't like Tomb Raider.

320
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,740
I didn't like breaking her, you know, by throwing her off the cliff.

321
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,620
No, that was all about Tomb Raider 2. Where you can make her explode, lock the butler in the

322
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,420
walk-in freezer, and then make her jump off the balcony where she breaks her neck.

323
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,220
the sound was fantastic Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best

324
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,340
so yeah it's I don't know how many titles it's going to support but it's going to support a lot

325
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,860
the question is how big of a memory stick do you need for all this

326
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,580
and you know how much they're going to cost

327
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,860
because they seem not to have mentioned how much the cost is going to be

328
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,340
but here's the thing I think they're testing this out for the PlayStation 3

329
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,300
because they're going to offer the same service for the PlayStation 3

330
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Oh, you think, huh?

331
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
I think.

332
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Oh, really?

333
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,620
Well, they like pushing the digital distribution thing, so why not?

334
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,620
Alright.

335
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,980
Uh, hooray for Castlevania Symphony of the Night being on that list.

336
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,540
Probably the best PlayStation game, in my opinion, period.

337
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,940
The best PlayStation game.

338
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,220
Uh, boo for no Intelligent Cube.

339
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,700
Well, these are only five.

340
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,940
They can go to hell.

341
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,500
He might be one of the 7,000.

342
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
You know, I-

343
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
What?

344
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,340
We need this freaking Iron Hound.

345
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,240
How come Ridge Racer wasn't on that list?

346
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,660
I thought that was the big thing that they were touting at E3, was Ridge Racer.

347
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,260
Well, that's just a given.

348
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,360
Alright, well anyway, I have to mention, speaking of Ridge Racer, there is a brand new Ridge

349
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,460
Racer title coming to the PSP.

350
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,780
It's RID Racer 2.

351
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,780
RID Racer 2.

352
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,780
Can I edit that out?

353
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Alright.

354
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:53,860
Ridge Racer 2 in the latest issue of Famitsu magazine.

355
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:02,160
It's going to start off where the last game left off.

356
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,160
It will have a return of the Nitro system as well as all the drift-based racing that

357
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,320
makes Ridge Racer, what the hell, I can't talk!

358
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,440
That makes Ridge Racer what it is.

359
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
You know what it is?

360
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
If I don't say it, Ridge Racer, then I can't say it at all.

361
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
That's the problem.

362
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,920
Here's the thing about Ridge Racer, each game has been exactly the same as the last

363
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
one.

364
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
No, no, no, no, it has not.

365
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Okay, so it's R4.

366
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,100
Hold on, R4 was the best of them.

367
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,440
You didn't let me finish.

368
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,080
There are new modes as opposed to Ridge Racer 1 on the PSP.

369
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:42,440
There is, of course, the returning World Tours, Time Attack, Wireless, but now there is Arcade,

370
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,000
Duel, and Survival Mode.

371
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,480
And Arcade Mode is kind of like an arcade racing game where you try to get to a goal

372
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,120
in a certain amount of time and then you get more time as you get to each checkpoint.

373
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,080
Survival is where you play chicken.

374
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
That would be fun.

375
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,040
That would be like Twisted Metal Ridge Racer.

376
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:08,760
Alright, so anyway, rumor is the game is 70% complete and the Japanese release should be

377
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
September 14th.

378
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,400
Yes.

379
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Speaking of, you know, Ridge Racer and Sony, Sony is actually claiming that Microsoft is

380
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,120
copying them.

381
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,160
That they are completely cloning the Playstation 3 with the Xbox 360.

382
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,320
Now I'm not sure we're in that argument that makes sense.

383
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,160
Okay, seeing as the Playstation 3 is not even out yet, I'm not sure what this is all about.

384
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,320
I mean, is it the camera and the iToy thing?

385
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,600
No, this was an interview that was done in the official Playstation magazine.

386
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
That won't be biased at all, I'm sure.

387
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,520
Which, yeah, okay.

388
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,840
And it says, brings up how everyone is comparing Microsoft to Sony, and the Sony rep claims

389
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:57,560
as soon as they do something, they see Microsoft trailing behind them, following their strategies.

390
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Huh. That's kinda funny. I will give them credit on one thing.

391
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,160
One thing only. The fact that they have dual analog sticks on the controller.

392
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,680
And that's about it. Because

393
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,040
that's, you know, I think that was the first system the PlayStation to do that.

394
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,160
But that's about it. That's all I'm giving them.

395
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,880
Well the DualShock controller is easily one of the top three controllers of all

396
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,560
time,

397
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:29,520
you know, but in turn wasn't the DualShock controller just a grown-up version of the

398
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,280
Super Nintendo controller in a way?

399
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:41,680
This was Kaz Hirai, I guess, and another quote that was taken from the interview here.

400
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,580
And the other thing is, you take a look at, for example, the fact that we incorporate

401
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,800
the Blu-ray drive from day one, you're not going to be asking me, so talk to me about

402
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,640
this blu-ray add-on that you have does it work for games is it just for movies

403
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,240
that's exactly the kind of pitfall you fall into if you launch something that's

404
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:08,960
too early to premature no you're launching a year late gag order Sony set

405
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,360
up before on this program you need it everybody needs to stop talking right

406
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,680
now it's working for Nintendo very I mean some of them talk but they don't

407
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,440
talk as much as you do. Let me put it this way, let me put it this way. They're copying

408
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,300
a lot of people, I mean, you've got to admit, okay, the whole live thing, granted it's a

409
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,400
great business model, okay, they can't say they're completely original on their, they're

410
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,680
copying the business model basically and trying to make it their own, but that's fine, okay,

411
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,400
because it's something that needs to be done, just like the controllers look, you know,

412
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,280
kind of the same, they're, you know, pretty much the same nowadays. That's fine, but don't

413
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,480
Go and claim that you're the one that created it when your system's not even out there yet.

414
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,420
Hell, we don't even know what their online marketplace is like and say that,

415
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,280
oh, well, Microsoft ripped us off.

416
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,480
Well, that's kind of impossible to do if you don't, you know, you can't rip off the future.

417
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,880
Wasn't there some rumor going around this week, and I apologize if I'm

418
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,380
spoiling somebody else's story for later in the show, but I don't remember this coming up,

419
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,180
but I seem to recall something about the Xbox 360 was

420
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,080
I had hinted that they wanted to add something to their controller,

421
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,960
like there's some type of... like that was kind of pointing like they

422
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,380
might do motion sensing

423
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,200
in their controller. But I don't see that happening.

424
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,760
I heard that. But no. I think I heard it on another show or something.

425
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,040
There's some other stories that we'll have that kind of hints that they're copying

426
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,720
Nintendo a bit more too. Alright, we'll get there in a minute.

427
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,400
Alright, we'll see. Anyway, I wanted to mention this. I'm sure a lot of folks are amazed at the

428
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,880
price

429
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,480
of the PlayStation 3. Well, they might get amazed a little more. This is also, again,

430
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,560
from an interview with PlayStation magazine, a quote from Kaz Harai,

431
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,880
generally speaking over the past 12 years or so, there has been a consumer

432
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,100
expectation that disc-based games are maybe $59 on the high end to $39 on the

433
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,220
low end. So what I can say now is, I think it would be a bit of a stretch to think

434
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,140
that we could suddenly turn around and say PlayStation 3 games now $99.99. I

435
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,600
don't think consumers expect software pricing to suddenly double. So the quick

436
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,000
answer is that we want to make it as affordable as possible, knowing that there is a set consumer

437
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,080
expectation for what software has caught the past 12 years.

438
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,040
That's kind of the best answer I can give you.

439
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,440
So if it becomes a bit higher than $59, don't ding me.

440
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,480
But again, I don't expect it to be $100.

441
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,920
So you mean we're going to get screwed on the price of the games too?

442
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,020
I'm I'm not hearing him again when he when he says that I'm not here in

443
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,680
The games are gonna be competitively priced with Xbox 360

444
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:49,300
I'm hearing we might want to charge 69 99 or 79 99 for these games just to here's the thing

445
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
And I don't want to sound like a broken record

446
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:58,740
It's not I mean honestly I am trying to find you know the good side of the whole Sony argument here, and you know one

447
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,220
You know, come on, I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible.

448
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,060
This is why people say we're anti-Sony, Jamie.

449
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:10,860
I owned, listen, I owned a Sony Playstation, I owned a Playstation 2, I said, fuck Xbox,

450
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
I'm not buying an Xbox.

451
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
I did too.

452
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,180
I was right there with you, I said, fuck Xbox, and it first came out, yep.

453
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,180
But even still, you know, when the Playstation 3, when they were talking about it originally,

454
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,980
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to own a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360, because I love the Playstation

455
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,380
3 games and stuff, and it sounds cool.

456
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,560
And then at E3 it was like,

457
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,860
you lost me. It's like crazy world over there.

458
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,200
The thing is, and they always do this. I think my expectations were met perfectly.

459
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,860
They're trying to basically say our games, you have to understand

460
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,920
you're paying for HD games, you're paying for games that have

461
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,760
higher development costs, you're paying for media that's twenty dollars

462
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,080
for blanks or whatever.

463
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,840
This is why the games are more expensive. You're gonna have to pay for this.

464
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,840
But the thing is when people are developing games on both platforms

465
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,360
and it's even been said before you can't tell the difference between them so why

466
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,900
the hell

467
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,400
and this is also you know Microsoft is doing the same thing with the Xbox and

468
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,440
Xbox 360 games especially at launch

469
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,120
that were only slightly different okay why should I pay more money for a game

470
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,440
that looks exactly the same and probably plays exactly the same

471
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,960
on a system that's even more expensive. People aren't and

472
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,720
you know what that's gonna be a problem for them. I don't know that argument seems a

473
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,980
little Nintendo fanboyish to me for some reason

474
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,560
like you know with the way you phrase that makes it sound like you're all

475
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,260
about the Wii

476
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,960
in that way no I mean okay I mean you're into whatever you're into but I'm just

477
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,520
saying if they are going to be pushing a system that

478
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,800
this is you know the games are $79 I better see a vast improvement between

479
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,120
that and the 360 version

480
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,280
those games better do my fucking dishes if they're gonna be $80

481
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,360
that's insane I'm just saying that they've gotta

482
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,840
at least 360 I wanna see has five dollar games on their marketplace that kick butt

483
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,920
I want to see stuff that they were showing, you know, in those E3 videos or whatever,

484
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,500
you know, showing, or the game developer conference videos.

485
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:09,640
You know, I want my next, you know, Jack and Daxter game or Ratchet and Clank to look like

486
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,220
a goddamn movie.

487
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:18,560
That's what I want to see if it's going to be this expensive.

488
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
I don't know.

489
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Alright.

490
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
We'll see.

491
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,920
until about a month before or maybe two months before when the actual pricing is announced.

492
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,920
But I'll tell you what, you know, if that's their argument is that, oh, well, we have

493
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,040
to price it this way because we're taking full advantage of the HD, dah, dah, dah, dah,

494
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
dah.

495
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,740
Okay, you're taking full advantage of the HD, but how much of the marketplace is ready

496
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,580
to take full advantage of the HD?

497
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,820
Not a lot this year.

498
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,140
Maybe this time next year even or the year after because with each Christmas the price

499
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,880
of the HDTVs are going to get lower and lower, maybe we'll be ready to talk.

500
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,140
But honestly, it's not like HDTV, I mean, I am an HDTV owner, I love it, and I would

501
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,240
highly recommend it to everybody, but looking at like even just regular television, there's

502
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,000
not a lot of embracing of HDTV yet, there's not a whole lot of incentive to go to HDTV

503
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
right now.

504
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,960
And if you're going with the Sony concept here, your HDTV would not be good enough,

505
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,000
because it does not display 10 AVP.

506
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Wow.

507
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,080
It's I don't know I it might it has HTMI

508
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,800
I don't know no not every TV is gonna be able to it'll actually say

509
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,900
Usually in your manual that comes with your TV well, then Sony can suck it. I don't know. Thank you

510
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,160
Hooray for that. I know I'll buy one anyway. I have to have one I have to play Final Fantasy 13

511
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,800
I'm that sad I will buy the damn machine

512
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,280
But I'll probably bitch about it if I'm not satisfied you know and like you're gonna buy one too

513
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,960
you're sitting here all anti Sony I hate Sony however I was anti Xbox and I

514
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,740
bought one okay listen I'm I buy everything new that comes out you

515
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,840
probably buy a game com okay I understand I have a virtual and that's

516
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,360
the same thing I just I have to own it all I'm like Veruca salt I mine mine

517
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,200
mine me me me I want it all exactly here's the thing though I'm not getting

518
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,640
it at launch I am NOT getting it at law I didn't get 360 at launch and I turned

519
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,600
out okay yeah exactly and I'm just saying just based on what games are you

520
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,000
coming out right now okay I really hate to bring this story to light because

521
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,360
it's just it really you gotta wonder what crazy-ass people they got working

522
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,440
at Sony I'm sorry this news came from a website called gamefront.de it's a

523
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:46,160
The German site that has a lot of information on Sony Playstation and the Wii and all that

524
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
stuff.

525
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,720
They noticed, and I was looking for it right before the show, that Sony has registered

526
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,480
a patent in the Japanese patent office to name their controller.

527
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,040
You will not believe what this controller is going to be called.

528
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Try me.

529
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:10,640
The name that they named the controller, and it actually looks kind of weird, it's a P

530
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,480
and an S with almost like an infinity symbol in the middle, but according to the patent

531
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,440
it's P space O O space S.

532
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Poohs.

533
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Poohs.

534
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,040
They're saying that the circles might actually represent the analog six.

535
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,280
So what you have here is them copying the Wii in the name of... but the controller is

536
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
called...

537
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,400
Oh really, it's a PlayStation.

538
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
I get P.S.

539
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
That makes sense.

540
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:45,420
I understand, you know, with the little circles, I guess that could be kind of nice.

541
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,000
The Poohs and the Wii?

542
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,240
The Pooh and the Wii?

543
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,640
What's the Xbox 360 going to come out with?

544
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
The sphincter.

545
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
The Poohs.

546
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,640
What the hell are they thinking?

547
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,880
okay show me the logo okay so I said you had a picture of it right I have a

548
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,440
picture of the logo and I will show it to you and I will actually probably

549
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,920
post this in our forum just so everyone can look at it it's okay convince me

550
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,160
this isn't fake honestly because I look at this and I go what if this is some

551
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,680
and this is some anti Sony person's idea of a really bad joke

552
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,520
Rob I looked at the website I couldn't see the only thing I couldn't look up

553
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,400
the patent, or not the patent, the trademark on there, because I have no idea how to look

554
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,820
up those trademarks on that website. You can't search by company or anything like that. You

555
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,580
have to know the trademark number. Well, I looked at their screenshot and it looks like

556
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,720
off that website. So granted, it could be an elaborate hoax or something like that,

557
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,620
but I think it would be really weird for them to do that. Because the site seems to carry

558
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:51,900
a lot of news stories that are fact, and I would see this as kind of off the wall. And

559
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,580
that's why I was really looking for this because that's comedy gold right there

560
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:05,020
ain't I'm sorry I just I just don't buy it like maybe I'm having like you

561
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,740
remember when like the morning I remember the morning that the Wii was

562
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,500
announced like Nintendo fanboys were like oh that's not right that's a lie

563
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,060
it's not called the Wii stop fucking with us Sony fanboys I'm like having

564
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,780
one of those moments I'm like seriously you can't be calling this the poos that

565
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,940
is that you gotta read you have to realize what you're doing here well this

566
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,060
but see that logo is too I don't know it's too simplistic to me I just it

567
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,340
screams fake I don't think I buy it I really don't well I'm just going by what

568
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,760
it looks like here it looks so much like it like an infinity but it looks like an

569
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,980
eight so seriously because the left side is smaller than the right well I think

570
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,980
I think what that might mean or whatever is, I don't know, have something to do with the tilting of it or something, I don't know.

571
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
Because you can't...

572
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,980
No, if they were showing it tilted it would have been at a completely different ratio.

573
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,980
I don't know what they're thinking, but anyways...

574
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Yeah, sorry, I still call bullshit. I don't think they're dumb enough to name their console the poos.

575
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
Well, I was looking...

576
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
Or the controller the poos.

577
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:14,980
I'm looking and you know what, I'll try to find this and I seriously think, just looking at the screenshot, that is a shot straight off that website.

578
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,140
I know just from browsing the website, it looks exactly like it.

579
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:24,380
So you know what, it could be a hoax, but if it's not, it should be in there somewhere

580
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,980
and we should be able to find it.

581
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,000
So either way, you're going to find out pretty soon.

582
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,980
And if it is, that's really weird.

583
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Really weird.

584
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
We'll see.

585
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
I don't know.

586
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,980
I'm taking that with a huge grain of salt.

587
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,460
But if that turns out to be the real name, if we're back here next week with some type

588
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,220
of confirmation stuff I'm just gonna I'm gonna shed more tears for Sony cuz the

589
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,700
poos I mean you realize okay it's an infinity sign it's not oh oh but you're

590
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,540
saying that's how they've trademarked it right is that's his piece space oh oh

591
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:01,020
space s is what it's on and that doesn't sound a little anti Sony fanboy to you

592
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,220
that doesn't sound I don't know well it didn't the whole the whole story from

593
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,300
them and I don't have it translated unfortunately. It was just saying that they had registered

594
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:18,940
a patent for their controller or a trademark for the controller and it says that they speculate

595
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,660
and okay the PNS of course is PlayStation, the two circles are the analog six. They didn't

596
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,660
draw the distinction that it's naughty, you know, poo. They didn't laugh about it. They

597
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,500
just basically reported it as a story. And that's it and it had a picture of the logo

598
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,500
go on there. Alright, our few chatters that are here today want to see the article for

599
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
themselves, so we'll link it in the chat room so you can see it.

600
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Gamefront.de, and if you scroll down quite a bit, it should be, there's a story about

601
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,420
the Eye of Judgment right below it, so just speaking of poo. Alright, well...

602
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,760
That's not just poo, that's like the poo of poo.

603
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,800
Many console names make us crazy and cause us to get a little angsty, and that makes

604
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,760
us want to get really, really angsty and do our FUs of the Week.

605
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,960
How's that sound, DarkSakura?

606
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:25,780
My FU of the Week is actually not what it was going to originally be.

607
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,820
actually toured my work for having these stupid retarded meetings for two hours

608
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:37,900
about crap they don't know oh what about our pension we don't know that yet oh

609
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,260
what about our thing we don't know that either

610
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,180
oh but what about this let me read directly off of our website that's been

611
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:51,940
posted for the last three days oh people it's there's two words for that meeting

612
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:57,120
premature and pathetic there was no call for it is I mean it's basically I think

613
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,940
just to smooth things over but really all it did was like just piss people off

614
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:07,360
so a big F you took that stupid meeting how pointless it was you know give us a

615
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:16,480
meeting when we actually have some information on it so my F is going to

616
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,560
Sony because every day I read something crazy and crazier from them and

617
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:40,560
I did get a lot of laundry done, though, so I'll at least smell clean when I go to Canada.

618
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Cuz I hear they check for that at the border.

619
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Does Sky smell laundry fresh?

620
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Oh, that was you.

621
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:59,480
There actually is a little bit of release news for our dear friends in the UK.

622
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,040
The Take-Two's game, Prey, has been announced to be released on July 14th, which is actually

623
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,960
three days after we're going to get it here.

624
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,860
There's also going to be a limited edition version for the PC, and there's a saying likely

625
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:21,860
that there's going to be a demo for the Xbox 360 showing up on live pretty quick.

626
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,220
That's another one of those things everybody's on Major Nelson's blog going, where's our

627
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,820
Prey demo? Where's the demo? Where's Street Fighter?

628
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,880
Basically for anyone who doesn't know, Prey is... you're playing as a garage mechanic

629
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,940
who gets kidnapped by aliens and has to save the world with his dead grandfather to guide

630
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,880
him. Yeah, isn't that fantastic? That really makes me want to play Prey.

631
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
I want to check it out.

632
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
I want to play that game so that I can throw up.

633
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Oh, because of motion sickness and all that?

634
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,380
Yeah.

635
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,880
Oh, okay.

636
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,380
I don't really care for first-person- I haven't liked a first-person shooter since, uh, Hexen, really.

637
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,880
Um, I haven't played one a lot since, like, Halo 2, probably, but I'm- I'll give it a shot.

638
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,380
I mean, I'll watch it.

639
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,880
It's got a lot of hype, it's gotta be- there's gotta be something about it.

640
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,380
I actually could sit through, um, through, uh, uh, Perfect Dark Zero without getting sick for a little while.

641
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,260
See I tried to get into that and I just couldn't oh, I'm personally not too excited about prey

642
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,800
However, I know some of our listeners are so hey guess what praise coming out sweet

643
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,820
Yes, that game looks actually pretty cool

644
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,100
It's gonna have really awesome multiplayer apparently

645
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,060
What speaking of multiplayer actually?

646
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:37,300
Oblivion's got another mod for the PC and that's a multiplayer mod

647
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:45,300
It's kind of in alpha right now, but it allows you right now to basically exist in the same world with somebody else.

648
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:53,300
But they're hoping that later on they're going to be able to add support up to eight players along with deathmatch and capture the flag.

649
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
So, it's kind of nifty.

650
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,300
Wait, oblivion multiplayer capture the flag?

651
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,300
That's kind of weird.

652
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,300
That's crazy though, somebody built multiplayer into oblivion?

653
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,620
yeah you would think that

654
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,580
they would want to put that in the game themselves and charge you know five

655
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,340
bucks for it on xbox 360

656
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,500
you know next to the horsey armor and all that stuff yeah

657
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,780
if the if they were even to do that I don't that's I don't that's a weird

658
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,620
add-on that's I mean that I mean it sounds great but that seems like it

659
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,860
would change the game

660
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,300
I think it would be pretty cool to go do just not even like if you can't do deathmatch

661
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,580
but do like co-op

662
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,340
co-op would be pretty cool. I mean that's like a whole other

663
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,780
idea for an Oblivion game honestly. That's crazy that somebody built that

664
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,420
into

665
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,940
that takes some real talent and skill and

666
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,700
sleepless nights and coffee to be able to do. Wow.

667
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,540
Yeah. Speaking of Oblivion, kind of an exclusive here.

668
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,380
Another wonderful item appeared in my system at work

669
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,180
that would be Oblivion on the PS3. It's going to be coming out

670
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,180
currently at launch

671
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:10,220
My guess is probably after launch sometime, but it is coming. Okay. So why have we heard until today?

672
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:18,020
Anything about that? I hope I know people don't watch the retail sites. They do watch they do watch GameSpot and EB because I know it's my

673
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,580
Similar stories the one we talked about on Sunday night have appeared on Monday, you know, I like the live arcade thingy

674
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,780
Yeah appeared because they saw the box art from

675
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,540
from GameStop, apparently, which pulled it off their website, too, and, funny enough,

676
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:39,580
all those titles I said were correct, so, whew, heard it here first, except they didn't

677
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,820
get the hundred points in there, but they mentioned everything else, so.

678
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,820
Interesting.

679
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,140
No, I think when I saw the box cover, it had something about that.

680
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
I don't know.

681
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
It doesn't matter.

682
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Whatever.

683
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,140
Whatever.

684
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
You were close enough.

685
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,140
Good job, Loki.

686
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,900
PlayStation 3?

687
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,500
Oblivion is a really big game on Xbox 360, but the biggest game on the regular Xbox was

688
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,200
no doubt Halo 2.

689
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,700
When Halo 2 was first released, there was a company, Plantronics, and they created a

690
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,580
special edition Halo 2 headset.

691
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:21,060
It cost about $49.95 to $59.95, but the cool thing was that they were donating $1 of the

692
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,940
proceeds to the Plantronics Gamecom United Way Katrina Relief Fund. Now, I

693
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,700
know that doesn't sound like a whole lot of the cost, but something to note is

694
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:39,260
that the price of those headsets has now dropped to $14.95 to $19.95 for your Xbox

695
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,580
Communicator Special Halo 2 Edition, so check that out. And some of it goes to

696
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:49,580
charity, so you can feel good about yourself as you go kill people on Halo.

697
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,700
well killing people

698
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,700
is not a good thing to do unless they're in your way

699
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,420
then buy out, no I'm kidding, however there are

700
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,900
prisoners who are at a

701
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,220
Wakefield prison in the UK

702
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,420
who have to get rid of their PlayStation 2's

703
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,460
oh boo hoo, yeah I mean being in prison wow

704
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,740
but basically there were inmates

705
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:29,260
at this prison who were found that they were watching porn on their PlayStation 2s, and

706
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:38,180
so they received 200 pounds each for every confiscated machine.

707
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,180
Huh.

708
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,180
It's like...

709
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,100
Oh, so wait, wait, wait, they took them, but then they paid them for it?

710
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Yeah.

711
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Isn't that great?

712
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,660
200 pounds. Yeah, that's a lot of money. I'm like, yeah, that's a lot

713
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,240
Yeah, I'm pretty sure yeah cuz the pounds worth more than a dollar right now, right

714
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:04,700
So basically, yeah for the nine prisoners who had theirs taken away. That's that's 1800 pounds, you know

715
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,720
Well now did they have all the porn taken away too?

716
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,080
Because maybe that justifies why they were paid so much because they probably had some really impressive collections of pornography

717
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,200
I mean, but even so keep in mind that you know, this is probably coming out of the

718
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,840
pockets of people. Now the prison service is saying that they're refunding the

719
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,280
prisoners because they bought the PlayStation 2's with their own

720
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:31,020
money but and there's also been a mention that not compensating them might

721
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,520
have been a breach of human rights but you know what I think they breached

722
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,200
their the rights of whoever they violated when you know whatever crime

723
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,000
they did to put themselves in jail. You're in jail as punishment it

724
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,520
shouldn't be happy fun time they should get a brick wall with a toilet attached

725
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:55,840
to it and a piece of board to lay on okay not that bad but but seriously like

726
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,720
if you've killed somebody yeah you get a cell well who knows who knows what these

727
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,880
people were I mean they could have been like this is a maximum security never I'm

728
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,200
like they could have been drug criminals and you know um for saying that among

729
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,560
those it was taken from they were sex offenders oh who I watch in porn that's

730
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,400
lovely okay I get it I get absolutely no sympathy for a sex offender gotcha but

731
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,320
also as quoted by Norman Brennan who's the chairman of the victim of crime

732
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,400
trust was quoted in the Yorkshire Post that it made a mockery of the whole

733
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:35,480
criminal justice system and honestly I don't know what to think about that I

734
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,460
think it's kind of sad they had him to begin with well better porn than shower

735
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,060
rapes I mean honestly I think if you're in prison for something it shouldn't be

736
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,460
happy fun time it should be paper you pay your penalty honestly I'd rather

737
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,340
without getting into a political discussion I'd rather take they take out

738
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,980
their sexual frustrations on you know porno then you know shower rape beat the

739
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,980
meet instead of just being able to beat each other.

740
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,980
Exactly.

741
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:11,200
Speaking of beating things, they're actually having a professional video game competition

742
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,800
in the UK here pretty soon.

743
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:20,020
There's going to be, it's kind of part of this extreme sports channel, something that

744
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:25,940
we definitely don't get over here, but they're actually going to be hosting kind of a series

745
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:35,180
of live video gaming events that'll take place during, what was it, some show that's going

746
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,060
on over there, the Ripspeed Donnie Car Show. I don't know if that's any big thing that

747
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,260
I should say. Car show? Car show. It's supposed to get in, it's supposed to... It's Sunday,

748
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,780
Sunday, Sunday! Come on down to the car show and video game to rent. It's, okay, it's going

749
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,620
to be happening... Babes and Halo. It's supposed to be happening on the 13th of August, and

750
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:09,600
If you're curious you can look it up at www.donnyshow.co.uk and they're expecting to get 20,000 visitors,

751
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,320
which I don't know if that's big for a car show or not, but it's going to take place

752
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,320
at the North Weld Airfield in Essex.

753
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,200
What you can expect there though, they're going to be having the Xbox Cup, which is

754
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,840
a four and a half, or four half hour live broadcasts of the Adidas World of Football

755
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:34,200
in Berlin, which is going to be on Saturday, this Saturday actually, or, well, by the time

756
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:41,840
you get this podcast, probably yesterday. So I hope you watched it, or else TiVo'd it.

757
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,140
But anyways, for that one that's actually going on during the car show, they're going

758
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,600
to be doing Project Gotham 3, Turner... Do they have TiVo in the UK? I don't know.

759
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,520
I'm sure they have some type of DVR.

760
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,920
They're going to be having a Project Gotham Racing 3 tournament at the car show, which

761
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,800
is appropriate since it is a car show.

762
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:10,480
And yeah, so basically the Extreme Sports Channel has, you know, labels Joystick Junkies.

763
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,640
And they're bringing together hundreds of UK's very best gamers to compete in the UK's

764
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,880
first live televised pro-racing games tournament.

765
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,180
After seven days of grueling heats on Xbox Live in the morning at Ripspeed Donnie, the

766
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,840
final 16 competitors will be pitting their racing skills against the very best the UK

767
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,840
has to offer.

768
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:38,400
They will be playing Project Gotham Racing 3 on an open-air 20 foot by 15 foot LED screen

769
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,280
on live television and the pressure will be on to give the best performance with huge

770
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,940
audience and the hot list of prizes up for grabs.

771
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,820
Some of our chatters that are actually awake and listening to us in the chat room.

772
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,820
All three of them?

773
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,820
Yeah, all three of them that are going there.

774
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,740
We have Sakarina and Rama are screaming at me that, yeah, they do have some form of TiVo

775
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,740
over in the UK.

776
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,740
That's what I said.

777
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,740
They have TV.

778
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,700
I figured they had something like it, but...

779
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,860
Oh my God, TiVo's only in the US.

780
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,020
No, no, no, their TV is different the way it's set up.

781
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,340
You pay the fee and everything.

782
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,340
No, no, I don't mean...

783
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,340
Forget it.

784
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,340
Forget it.

785
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,660
Yeah, they have that PAL thing.

786
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,660
No.

787
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,660
Forget it.

788
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:22,160
The four 30 minute live broadcasts are going to be on Sunday the 13th of August with the

789
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:30,380
programming repeated between 9pm and 11pm and midnight to 2am so fun fun but hey that's

790
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,820
kind of neat though especially with the Gotham TV.

791
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:38,140
Gotham TV if they actually do it right they can make it look pretty cool so I don't know.

792
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,740
Alright should be fun to watch.

793
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:49,740
Well, as far as things to watch, you know, anime games are, you know, getting big, we're getting our Naruto, we're getting all kinds of things, but, um...

794
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,740
Too bad all the reviews of Naruto have been crap!

795
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,740
You know what? I played that game already, I've been playing it, it was pretty fun.

796
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,740
It's really fun when you get four-person multiplayer in that game.

797
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,740
Alright.

798
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,740
But, uh, Saint Seiya's coming to Europe!

799
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,740
Saint Seiya's a freakin' OLD ass anime, I don't know why it's taking this long.

800
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,120
Atari and Namco Bandai are bringing out

801
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,160
Saint Seiya the Hades to Europe

802
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,880
later on in the year. It's based off the manga and anime

803
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,000
Over here it was called Knights of the Zodiac or some stupid

804
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,360
crap. No, they had Saint Seiya over here.

805
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,680
They had Saint Seiya over here. I thought it came out over here as Knights of the Zodiac.

806
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,560
No, I thought they had it. Anyway, but basically it's

807
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,500
supposed to be full-on anime style you have the Cosmo system pulled in

808
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,600
it's supposed to be out in autumn

809
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,820
alright that's pretty

810
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:50,360
pretty spiffy there I don't know the anime games don't seem to do too well at least I know

811
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,440
from a work standpoint you know people Dragon Ball anyway

812
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,000
there's always Dragon Ball or Yu-Gi-Oh does Yu-Gi-Oh count as anime?

813
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,560
I guess it's more of a card game than anime

814
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,060
What did it start as? Did it start as a card game or did it start as a anime?

815
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,820
It started as the card game, right? No, it started as the card game. Actually it was

816
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:13,540
another thing before that, like dual monsters and then it was Yu-Gi-Oh!

817
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,540
And I actually have Yu-Gi-Oh! manga from a shounen jumper from 1991.

818
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,340
Hold on, hold on, put the brakes on.

819
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,220
I just realized we're wasting time on the show talking about Yu-Gi-Oh!

820
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,760
I have a deck.

821
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,260
So as far as stuff coming out this week,

822
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:33,260
Nothing. I mean, absolutely almost nothing.

823
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,260
Oh yeah, the Tuesdays are big release days, right?

824
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,260
And Tuesdays are 4th of July, which is a big holiday here.

825
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,260
Well, no, not Tuesdays. Usually it's around Wednesdays or so.

826
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,260
But whatever, it doesn't matter.

827
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,260
Although, if you do have a 360, Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 is going to be coming out.

828
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,260
So, yippee.

829
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:55,260
And that's about the only good game that's coming out this week, to be honest.

830
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,580
There's like literally on my pre-book sheet that I was you know ordering for people four games

831
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,340
Wow, or and most of them were

832
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,500
Like there was was a board game classics 21. Oh

833
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,580
Ray to yay. All right

834
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,660
some soccer game that was on the Sony's official soccer game on the

835
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,940
PSP is coming out for which is funny because it's still o6

836
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,660
but whatever

837
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,180
that one's coming out and that's about it and even the week after that's even

838
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,660
actually the week after that's gonna be pretty good because that's when you get

839
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:35,060
praying chrome hands and stuff like that so uh all right but yeah okay so well we

840
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:41,940
are getting crap in the u.s. this week is the UK faring any better well you

841
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:49,300
know it would be fantastic if that was actually the case but not always well

842
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,260
Well I'll tell you what, there actually are some interesting things going to be out coming

843
00:52:54,260 --> 00:53:01,180
up in the first week of July, although honestly I don't see what's too exciting about Alex

844
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,660
Ryder's Stormbreaker.

845
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,740
That sounded pretty exciting, sorry my cell phone went off in the studio.

846
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:16,460
There's also Earache Extreme Metal Racing, although I have to say on the 7th they do

847
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,460
get ChromeHound.

848
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,720
Alex Ryder is going to be pretty sweet though, it's got a DS in that.

849
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,680
And they get electroplankton.

850
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,860
And Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow, and Super Dragon Ball Z.

851
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,240
And that's about it.

852
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,840
And Big Brain Academy.

853
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,840
I've heard Big Brain Academy is way better than Brain Training, but I've

854
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,360
only played it myself for like five minutes, so I need more time with it, but

855
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,360
it looks like there's a lot more to it. I love electroplankton.

856
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,920
Was playing that demo in line at e3 last year like the whole time

857
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,960
That's pretty cool. I don't know. It sounds like a lot of good stuff

858
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,960
So they're actually getting a lot of good games though in July. I mean just later on there's a coming out with

859
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:10,880
Civ 4, Civ City Rome, Shin Megami Tensei, which I saw some of at e3, Prey

860
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,300
There's actually some pretty decent stuff coming out in July

861
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:25,160
Anyways, speaking of stuff coming out, Eevee and Gamestop are going to be getting a special

862
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:33,380
edition of Final Fantasy 12, when that finally comes out, around Halloween. Included in that

863
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:42,220
of course will be a steel bookcase, developers interviews, history of Final Fantasy featurettes,

864
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:48,540
Final Fantasy XII US Trailers, Final Fantasy XII Japanese Trailers, Final Fantasy XII Art

865
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,740
Galleries as well.

866
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,940
Cosplay footage, please.

867
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,940
Damn.

868
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:03,380
And you can get that for $59.99 when that comes out Halloween.

869
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,460
Last week on the program we teased that we were going to start doing a new segment called

870
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,580
the voicemails of the week.

871
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,260
Unfortunately since we had been taping for about three and a half hours that night I

872
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,900
never gave you guys a topic.

873
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:16,660
So it kind of ties into the story that Loki was just talking about, and if you guys were

874
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:21,180
listening to last week's show during the Part B segment, there was a little bit of a heated

875
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,140
discussion here in studio about pre-ordering.

876
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,700
So what we want to ask as our voicemail question of the week is, do you pre-order games?

877
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,220
If so, what do you believe are the advantages of pre-ordering games?

878
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,740
If you don't pre-order games, why don't you do it?

879
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,740
We want to hear your feedback.

880
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,620
We'll place some of your responses on the air.

881
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,100
Give our voicemail a call any time during the week.

882
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:45,920
9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67 please keep in mind boys and girls that that may be a toll

883
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,120
call unless you happen to be local to where we are so please make sure you had

884
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,640
the permission of whoever's paying the phone bill before you give that a call

885
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,540
but what's your opinion on pre-ordering games and are you gonna pre-order Final

886
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:02,000
Fantasy 12 to get that super special limited edition I might I usually don't

887
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,860
pre-order games but I might because I'm that big of a 12 whore that I I might

888
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:13,100
want to have all that special shit so we'll see anyway I mentioned earlier in

889
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:17,260
the program that major Nelson's blog has been pretty active this week and he

890
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:22,940
wrote a pretty lengthy blog earlier this week about everybody's been bitching and

891
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,460
leaving comments as blog where Street Fighter 2 where's the demo for prey dot

892
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,840
that at that and you see these maintenance shutdowns going on and they

893
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,580
even really cock teased us with Street Fighter 2 because we have the theme and

894
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,460
the gamer pictures, but yet no games yet.

895
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,180
So, you know, Major Nelson is getting a lot of heat for this being the, you know, kind

896
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,300
of the community face there.

897
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:51,700
Basically he is saying blah, blah, blah, sometimes developers are not aware of the intense Microsoft

898
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,340
certification process, blah, blah, blah, sometimes they promise dates and they don't know what

899
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,100
the complexity is, blah, blah, blah.

900
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,580
I don't know guys, I don't, I mean I understand Major Nelson shouldn't be really taking the

901
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,740
blame for this crap, so you know, don't blame him.

902
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,940
But at the same time, how many different freaking release dates has Capcom announced for Street

903
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,500
Fighter 2 in various, you know, ways?

904
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,540
I mean it's kind of their own damn faults.

905
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,300
If they didn't, they shouldn't have announced the game was coming out if they weren't done,

906
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,220
you know, with certification or didn't, you know, realize or I don't know what, they shouldn't

907
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:30,220
have announced the damn game coming out at all or should have been very vague in it and

908
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:35,220
not get our hopes up time and time again because that's what causes people to get frustrated.

909
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:43,900
That does make sense, I mean, I don't know, I really wish they had just released more

910
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,300
games period on live, I understand they have to go through like quality controls and yada

911
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:54,900
yada yada, but there's some, I understand why Street Fighter is being delayed because

912
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,500
of the online lag that they have and they need to really get that fixed but at the same

913
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,120
time I don't understand you know why they just can't like for example the thing I'm

914
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,300
pissed off and it doesn't really have to do with live too much is how you know the official

915
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,740
Xbox magazine well they have a disc with it that comes with demos that are on live and

916
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:18,720
well it comes with demos and a lot of demos that are already on live have been on live

917
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,960
for like months so what the hell am I paying for this magazine for demos that I can already

918
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,800
download you know now but the same time they should be doing like you know put

919
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,040
some more content on there you know some more games or something because I know

920
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,080
that there can't be just you know one or two games coming out every now they I'm

921
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:40,520
sure people are lining up to you know put stuff on live so they see more

922
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,400
content that's what it comes down to and they need to stop teasing us with these

923
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,920
yeah I mean they didn't weren't they also saying there was gonna be two new

924
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,000
arcade games every month at least and we've had an absolute drought since UNO

925
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,280
at e3 yeah which I would say actually I'm gonna make a bold statement here I

926
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,880
think that's part of who knows huge success right now I think you know

927
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,840
obviously it's a it's a solid game and it's a fun thing to play online but

928
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,880
honestly I think the reason people are still talking about it and people are so

929
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,400
into it is that salt they've really got that's new in the past many months

930
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,680
before that what was the newest game like an astral pop or something really

931
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:22,480
do you really want to play hardwood backgammon i mean does anyone play backgammon anymore

932
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,360
my dad might i don't know i mean if i want to play backgammon i'll have a table a actual board game

933
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,960
i just don't get it but um you know that's their prerogative and how they want to do things

934
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,440
anywho by the way dmn in her chat room would like to point out that uh he would like to play

935
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,920
hardwood bag gamin so and is offering to fight you i believe i believe he's calling you out

936
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,800
backgammon sucks it was always on the other side of the chess or checkerboard and i was like what

937
00:59:52,800 --> 01:00:00,080
the hell is this i don't want to play this anyways um speaking of stuff that you know isn't out there

938
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:07,680
or it's not coming out australia reservoir dogs the game not coming out because they banned it

939
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:15,560
Why did they ban it? Well apparently it was awfully violent and it's kind of

940
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:21,280
interesting they were talking about some of the reasons why it was denied a game

941
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,820
classification and this kind of makes me want to buy the game more. Players

942
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,840
participants in a bank heist can literally blow the heads off of hostages

943
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,940
and police as well as execute hostages at point-blank range with the gunshot to

944
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,180
the head.

945
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,020
Use a series of so-called signature torture moves.

946
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:43,100
Players can use different means to torture hostages and thereby cause the police to lay

947
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,740
down their weapons, such as repeated pistol whippings to the side of the head with blood

948
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:54,020
spray evident, burning the eyes of a hostage with a cigar until they scream and die, cutting

949
01:00:54,020 --> 01:01:00,580
the fingers off of a hostage with blood bursts as the victim screams in pain.

950
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,580
In lieu of taking hostages, the players can opt to a more violent scenario where a slow

951
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,340
motion shootout occurs, accentuating the violence.

952
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,060
I am buying this game.

953
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:14,620
I know, it's like Australia just gave free advertising for the game for all the other

954
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,620
countries.

955
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,940
But that is a little odd that they'd ban it before it's even released.

956
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,580
Why aren't they going after this game?

957
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:25,940
Okay, when this game comes out, the MPAA better get off of hot coffee's ass for a little

958
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,580
bit of sex because this has slicing up fingers and burning out eyes.

959
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,580
I think it's a little worse. Of course there's no nudity, so...

960
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:36,900
Out of curiosity... Well, what about the movie? Yeah, out of curiosity, can I still walk into an

961
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,540
Australian

962
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:41,020
video store and pick up Resport Dogs the movie? Yeah, you can. Okay.

963
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:45,020
That's an interesting little...

964
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,860
It's industry's double standard. It's a double standard. Very interesting.

965
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,700
How stupid. I'm looking for the... I mean, I guess...

966
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:57,460
It's so stupid! Because it's the player that gets to do it,

967
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,700
it makes it you know because the interactiveness makes it worse

968
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,860
I guess is that the theory behind it I yeah I think so

969
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:08,060
that's awesome I am so buying

970
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,660
yeah I didn't realize the game was gonna be that violent I mean that would be kind of

971
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,340
stupid

972
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,740
not think a Reservoir Dogs game would be a cheap ass port

973
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,340
and now I really want to play this game alright we'll see

974
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:23,780
anyway oh good guy good comment in chat room dark Tetsuya says I can't wait to

975
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,260
hear

976
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:31,260
He Who Shall Remain Nameless's reaction to that game when it comes out here.

977
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,260
She's calling you-know-who.

978
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,260
Yeah, you-know-who.

979
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,260
Jackie Poo.

980
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,900
Anyway, you know who emails us every week?

981
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,480
I don't, but DarkSakura does because she's our mailbag mistress, and when you email mailbag

982
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,740
at orangelaungeradio.com, she puts on her hazmat suit, dives into the email bag, and

983
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:53,500
pulls out her favorite and most, I was about to say most least favorite, her least favorite

984
01:02:53,500 --> 01:03:07,500
emails. Her mostest, leastest emails. My mostest-ly. Just read the damn emails, DarkSaga. Oh geez.

985
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:12,460
First email comes from JeremyTod1. He says, it's JeremyTod1 again! As if I didn't get

986
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:17,820
that email. Wait, haven't you read his emails in the past four weeks in a row? Um, fine,

987
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:23,060
I'm skipping it, sorry. But he does say House of the Dead. You didn't have to skip it, I'm

988
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:27,340
the exploding action I just I want to make sure everybody gets heard it wants

989
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,580
to know what we think about arcade type shooters going on the Wii like house of

990
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:38,180
the dead you know I was listening to I want to say all games they had some

991
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:44,780
rumor about like a lightsaber game being on the Wii and I was thinking like you

992
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,660
know the Star Wars trilogy game like in the last stage you could actually fight

993
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,500
Darth Vader one-on-one with a lightsaber and I was thinking I'm not a huge Star

994
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:55,420
Wars fan but that would be one of the most fucking badass things ever to play

995
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:58,820
would be like a lightsaber game first-person fighter with the Wii

996
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:03,100
controller that is so freaking hardcore they need a blip man in chronic game

997
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:09,620
will you fight Mark Hamill as the cock knocker you're so lame but funny but

998
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:13,420
lame I would also like to see point-blank please thank you yes excuse

999
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:24,000
Speaking of Point Blank, actually, one of our other listeners, Robert M., says if you're

1000
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,840
still having trouble finding Point Blank DS, try Game Crazy. He says that apparently they've

1001
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,960
been pretty good to find him there. He found his copy and trauma center.

1002
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,280
How about it, Loki? You gonna go? There's a Game Crazy nearby here.

1003
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,920
You know, I thought the one that was in the Hollywood video by me closed down, but I think

1004
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
it's...

1005
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,920
No, I think it's...

1006
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
Go buy Kmart on Sunrise.

1007
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,920
I don't really care to play that game.

1008
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,920
I mean, I'll go get it eventually.

1009
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,200
You bitched about it for two weeks straight on this show that you couldn't find it, and

1010
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,320
now we're telling you, here it is, go get it.

1011
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
You're like, I don't want to go get it.

1012
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,320
Well, I don't know if I want to go get it.

1013
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, I want to go to GameStop because I have credit there, and so I don't want to have

1014
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
to actually pay money.

1015
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
There you go.

1016
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,840
Also, um, wants to know, uh, regarding the upcoming Transformers movie, uh, what if the

OSHA says happy birthday sky oh thanks this is my first email to orange

1038
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,740
lounge but I've been listening since the episode of someone I think it was a

1039
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:41,260
guest someone like DJ Ron Mez or someone who called in frequently swore off

1040
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:50,420
boners oh no that was explicit yeah yeah that was before the podcast and live

1041
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:55,140
show merged because we didn't school yeah I mean our old live shows used to

1042
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,380
be nuts we talked about really crazy stuff if you think we're off topic on

1043
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:03,360
this show. Geez, you should have heard our old live show. Uh, yeah, okay. It was probably

1044
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,740
last year's Lent, I think, was when you did that.

1045
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,380
And you said that your gift is something found on Google looking for World of Warcraft AMVs.

1046
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:15,620
Hope you find it as funny as I did, but there's not a link to it. You're all doing a great

1047
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:20,220
job, even with an anti-Mac co-host, and before I forget, he actually gave me what I'm using

1048
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,580
as my side of the week.

1049
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,580
Oh, awesome.

1050
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,580
Yeah.

1051
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,540
Well, thank you for the birthday wishes, and I haven't gotten a chance to watch the video

1052
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:31,840
yet because I think my outlook didn't like the attachment but maybe send it to

1053
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,320
me a web link or something and I'll try to get it you send it to me on the you

1054
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,880
send it or one of those sites that's usually the best way I didn't see because

1055
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,300
outlook doesn't like attachments from people for some reason it's this way I

1056
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,660
don't use outlook to check our meal you know I use the webmail because I can

1057
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:57,660
check it from work. Oh stop it. Next up is Carlos emailing us and we get says

1058
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:01,600
hey guys congrats on four years yay thank you I've been enjoying this

1059
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,940
podcast since August something and it's still made of win and awesome oh that's

1060
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:10,060
sweet thank you that's just that's what our cake was made of to win and awesome

1061
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:15,100
anyways I went to my local GameStop to pick up Mega Man EXE 6 poster they kept

1062
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:19,300
for me because I'm a family, and while I was talking to the manager, we're friends, out

1063
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,480
of the corner of my eye I noticed a Nintendo DS package with something in it. It looked

1064
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,820
like a GBA cartridge. I inquired about this and found out it was a rumble pack for Super

1065
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:32,000
Princess Peach, Metroid Pinball, and two other games. Now this didn't surprise me, and I

1066
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,920
thought gimmicks gimmicks until I saw the price tag, $99.99. In closing, I'd just like

1067
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,540
to say, what the fuck, Nintendo?

1068
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:46,100
I don't think the rumble fax 9999 I think it's 999 or something like that or

1069
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,380
isn't she? Maybe it was just a mistype or something? I think it was a mistype. There's no way that's a hundred bucks.

1070
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,460
Yeah I think maybe it was just a little oopsie. Well

1071
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,700
speaking of oopsies there's still more email. Alrighty.

1072
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,500
I'm actually really going through the email because I got quite a bit in just a few days.

1073
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,260
Yeah I know we're taping early this week too. Good job listeners!

1074
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:07,460
Drown her in that email. Hey!

1075
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:10,980
Oh dude sorry if I blew out somebody's speakers. Another one

1076
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,780
There's not a name. It's actually a trace said, uh, hey guys, it's nice

1077
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,620
I was wondering if any of you have played the game bumpies

1078
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:23,840
It's a DOS game and I think there would be a remake for the PSP like they did with lemmings

1079
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,940
I've never heard of that never heard of it. Sorry. Send us more info or a link or something. We'll check it out

1080
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,800
Why not? Um, especially if it's free free rocks

1081
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,980
Now I did get an email that at first sort of pissed me off

1082
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:39,500
Mm-hmm, and this is gonna be I'm not trying to be TMI about anything

1083
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:44,360
but you know what I said made the comment that yeah if I ever saw any of

1084
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,520
my kids reenacting something from a you know violent video game I pop one right

1085
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,080
well it wasn't necessarily that I would treat violence with violence because we

1086
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,960
got an email from one of our listeners you didn't mean you were gonna pop the

1087
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:01,120
kid with a baseball bat right no no I use my hand well okay this is how this

1088
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,360
is what I think about and you hit like a girl so when I'm just teasing I'm gonna

1089
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:12,300
get hit you're gonna get hit like a girl no but seriously um and I'm not gonna go

1090
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:16,220
into any detail because it's nobody's business but I do firsthand know the

1091
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:22,340
difference between abuse and punishment and so I think that I very well know

1092
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:29,340
where the limits the line would be drawn I think that the video game shouldn't be

1093
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:33,380
as much as the concern as the home environment that one is raised in as far

1094
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:38,580
as what determines if someone's going to turn out a violent person or not.

1095
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:43,680
I think that if me just going, oh well don't do that, oh well don't do that, oh well don't

1096
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:49,480
do that, stand in the corner, if that's not going to do the job, I'm not beyond, you know,

1097
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:57,080
doing a little physical discipline, you know, I was spanked as a kid, I've had much worse,

1098
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,160
you know, when you learn the difference.

1099
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,160
Was this an email?

1100
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,160
Yeah, it was an email.

1101
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,160
Okay.

1102
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:08,360
why I'm not going into any detail on the email, but I'd just like to clarify that, that's

1103
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,200
my feelings toward it.

1104
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:21,500
If it's going to save my child growing up to be some sort of serial killer or knowing

1105
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:26,920
that it's not right to go and kick somebody because they pissed you off, then I'm not

1106
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,360
beyond it.

1107
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,080
Let me try to spin it this way because I like to be the one that likes to make the happy

1108
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:39,440
politically correct, make everybody happy statement, so try to humor me on this one.

1109
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,960
There are certain choices that you get to make as a parent in the way you want to raise

1110
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,960
your kid.

1111
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,920
Actually, there are many choices that you get to make as long as, obviously, you don't

1112
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,140
break the law, but there are choices that you get to make and one of those choices is

1113
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,360
what we're talking about here, but another one that relates to the bigger topic at hand

1114
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:01,060
is you know do you want your child exposed to violent video games what do

1115
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:04,940
you believe is right for your child and so on that does exactly you know my

1116
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:08,780
point you know I think that if they're four years old yeah and sitting them

1117
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:14,580
down with you know dead to rights isn't necessarily a good idea maybe if they're

1118
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:20,940
like 13 that's not so much of a deal but you know it's not just the games you

1119
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:24,100
have to look at it environmentally how many children are raised with violence

1120
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,300
in their homes every day and don't own a video game system.

1121
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,300
That's my point on that.

1122
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,460
And you know, I think it starts with how parents choose to discipline their children and what

1123
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,460
they allow them to be exposed to.

1124
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,260
That was my point.

1125
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,260
Is that it?

1126
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:39,260
No.

1127
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,260
Alright.

1128
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,260
There's more.

1129
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,260
Two more.

1130
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,020
Like I said, I've got a lot of email.

1131
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,020
Alright.

1132
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,260
Oh, we may have to have a two part show tonight.

1133
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,260
I don't know.

1134
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:51,480
Krispy Kreme wants to know if you have to have an Xbox 360 to be part of the OLR army.

1135
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,480
Basically what are the requirements?

1136
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:58,240
you know I said starting up the whole one minor bitch correction the when it

1137
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,700
was coined the phrase it's actually o-l-r uppercase m-y lowercase o-l-r-me

1138
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:09,860
get it get it you can thank me for that I don't I don't think we ever

1139
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:15,200
specifically said how we wanted to do the o-l-r-me so the jury's out on that

1140
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,920
do you have to I think we want to have gaming clicks all over not just 360 but

1141
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,600
other games too. If you have a Super Nintendo, we want our Street Fighter 2 Championship edition.

1142
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,280
Or Killer Instinct. Killer Instinct. That should be one branch of the

1143
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,680
O.L. Army, absolutely. More to come on the O.L. Army when we have some ideas.

1144
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:38,880
But for any folks that are on MMOs, plug plug plug, I have a site roleplay.dartsakurai.com

1145
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:44,720
where I'm hosting MMO chats. In fact, Death Cakes still hosted there to this day.

1146
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,720
Oh, my old Final Fantasy XI link show, yeah.

1147
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,720
Even though none of us are there.

1148
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,720
You know, they've been going pretty strong on there.

1149
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,720
You know, if we get a big enough group, you know, I pick the people who are the most responsible to make moderators on the board.

1150
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:03,720
So, you know, temporary hosting, at least for the MMOs, and even tabletop gamers will be up on roleplay.dart.com.

1151
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,720
In other words, the hardcore nerds.

1152
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,720
The hardcore nerds. Hey, I do tabletop gaming.

1153
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,720
Well, you're also a hardcore nerd.

1154
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,720
Hell yeah. Nerd pride, yo.

1155
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,520
The last one is the biggest email ever!

1156
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:16,720
Really?

1157
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,720
It's a multi-paragraph email.

1158
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,220
Okay.

1159
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,720
And this was sent by, um...

1160
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:23,720
Joey.

1161
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:24,520
Okay.

1162
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,020
Hello Orange Lounge royalty!

1163
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:29,520
Ooh, I like this guy already, okay.

1164
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,720
Second time writing. First time was on Myspace asking for Genesis titles.

1165
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,020
I'd first like to thank you in the chatroom for giving some great recommendations to pimp out my Genesis 3.

1166
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,020
I-

1167
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,020
Our chairman's getting love!

1168
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:42,520
Wow!

1169
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,020
Yeah!

1170
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:48,020
I would love to join an Orange Lounge clan, I just don't call it the OC or something stupid.

1171
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,020
Orange Lounge Army sounds good.

1172
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,020
We would never relate this program to that.

1173
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,020
Come on, give us a little credit, dude.

1174
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:58,020
Orange Lounge Army sounds good, it's actually OL Army, but we just said that.

1175
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:01,020
Though I'm getting rid of a couple of my Xbox 360 games.

1176
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,020
Uh...

1177
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:03,020
What's...

1178
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:06,020
Uh, GR, AW, and Burnout Revenge.

1179
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:12,260
Okay, the only reason I am getting rid of, uh, okay, I'm trying to think of what GR,

1180
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,260
because of my brain.

1181
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,260
Ghost Recon.

1182
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,260
Ghost Recon, okay.

1183
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,260
See, I don't play that.

1184
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,260
That's right.

1185
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,260
It's because of Chapter 2.

1186
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,380
Basically, the way I feel about the upgrade packs is that they are a buy them or have

1187
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,820
fun finding a game online anymore.

1188
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:27,160
I have no problem with paying for more stuff, but not $15.

1189
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:32,060
If I thought, if I bought Chapter 2, I would have spent a total of approximately $80 considering

1190
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,060
taxes.

1191
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:38,420
So Gross Recon was fun, but hardly worth $65 taxes again, and not worth $80 to me, so I'm

1192
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:42,000
going to get $35 available towards something else.

1193
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,340
With Burnout, I'm simply just burned out from playing an HD Xbox clone.

1194
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,380
I looked up all the prices for stuff, and I should have around $120.

1195
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,960
I'm having a little battle of conscience of whether or not to put it to my inevitable

1196
01:15:53,960 --> 01:16:00,540
purchase of a Nintendo Wii, bless you, or spend the money on some of the, I guess, delish-looking

1197
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,740
Xbox 360 titles and accessories.

1198
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:06,540
I would like input, but I don't expect it because people are really cautious of saying

1199
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,860
anything these days.

1200
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:15,020
Going forward, leaning towards the Wii because I already have Zelda Twilight Princess for

1201
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,440
GameCube reserved, I will switch it to Wii most likely.

1202
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,100
In my opinion, either way you're going to be saving that money because if you were listening

1203
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,180
to the release date segment, there's really not a lot out there right now and honestly

1204
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,980
it sounds like you've kind of torn through a lot of the big Xbox 360 titles, like you

1205
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:34,720
know I like burnout it's fun for a while it's still fun for me right now so it

1206
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,860
sounds like you've got most of the good stuff already taken care of so right now

1207
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:43,620
there's really not a lot out but if you want good Xbox 360 titles one I'm pretty

1208
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:47,100
excited about looks pretty hot to me is a 99 nights but that's not coming out

1209
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,900
till August so you'd have to be saving your money for that so I think either

1210
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,580
way you're gonna end up saving your money so whether you decide to put it

1211
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:58,260
towards a Wii or whatever you know maybe wait and see when we get a little more

1212
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,980
information on the Wii or what have you. You'll notice that my gaming week

1213
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,740
personally has slowed down a little bit and I've been talking about the same games

1214
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,060
each week because there hasn't been a lot of new stuff that's been that

1215
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,380
exciting. I think most of us are kind of like we're catching up on old stuff or

1216
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,540
something. So it's kind of a slow period for games right now and I think

1217
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:17,100
you'll end up just saving your money for the fall. Smart idea.

1218
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,060
Play Animal Crossing with us. But no, there's actually one other paragraph on here that I

1219
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,020
think makes a really good point.

1220
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:26,700
Okay. Without the boycott for Fragdolls and PMS Clan. Oh yeah, I want to hear some

1221
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,120
feedback on that story that boycott the frag dolls and PMS planner pulling is

1222
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:34,320
just hypocritical I mean how do they think Microsoft and Ubisoft choose the

1223
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,000
women to join these clans it's obviously not gamerscore they choose the women

1224
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,120
that even out the best on looks and then they look at the talent that's why they

1225
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,600
had them running around the e3 doing interviews I'm in no way saying that

1226
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,760
there isn't talent in this clans they're really decent clans I'm just saying that

1227
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,440
because you have to have both looks and talents to be in them so saying that the

1228
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,040
beauty contest and whatnot is unfair because you don't actually have to be a

1229
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,640
hardcore gamer is kind of stupid. That just makes it like every other modeling

1230
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,760
show that has ever existed that they have never boycotted. I hope they

1231
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:11,040
actually do have the Mr. Video Game Beauty Contest. Average men would take

1232
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,600
competitions like these a lot more light-hearted than the ladies and it

1233
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,840
would actually be fun and maybe even funny in a light-hearted sense. This just

1234
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,560
applies to this type of contest though. Sports for Men is a different story.

1235
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:26,320
And he also wants to know what the song we use for my Website of the Week segment.

1236
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,480
It's Candy from DDR Ohasta, which is a Japanese import only game.

1237
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,480
Yep.

1238
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,480
Good luck finding that.

1239
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Alright.

1240
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,160
There are nefarious ways.

1241
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,560
Well done emails this week.

1242
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,560
I applaud lots of them.

1243
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,840
I applaud the listeners.

1244
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,280
Let's keep it moving.

1245
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,280
Yes.

1246
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:50,120
Speaking of fun stuff, Take Two has been subpoenaed over the hot coffee, yay, just when you think

1247
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:54,220
your tax dollars are going to something good, they're not.

1248
01:18:54,220 --> 01:19:03,220
So yes, basically Take-Two has received grand jury subpoenas and this is being issued by

1249
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:08,980
the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting the production of documents

1250
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:17,300
covering various periods beginning on October 1, 2001, including those relating to the hot

1251
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:24,060
coffee issue, and the creation, inclusion, and programming of hidden scenes.

1252
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:30,480
And also it should be noted that some people might be able to face jail time, which I think

1253
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,740
is funny because the whole system is a voluntary system, so how the hell are they going to

1254
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:39,240
go to jail over that?

1255
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,020
I think it's time for everybody to get past it already, I'm just so sick of hearing about

1256
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,020
it.

1257
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,020
I'm all about the new...

1258
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:50,220
Hey, listen, you know, Grand Theft Auto Liber- or, Gran- uh, San Andreas, that's so a couple

1259
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,220
years ago.

1260
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,220
You know what?

1261
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,100
I'm all about the Reservoir Dogs game.

1262
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,660
I'm very interested to see what happens with Grand Theft Auto IV.

1263
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,340
Do you think they're going to dumb it down a little bit in spite of all this when it

1264
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,340
comes to violence?

1265
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,340
I think they will.

1266
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,340
But here's the thing, sirs, I'm hoping.

1267
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,260
I'm hoping adult only and- GO CRAZY!

1268
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,260
That's what I want.

1269
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,940
You can't just get the adults only rating and go for it.

1270
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:10,940
Go for it.

1271
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:14,380
You cannot let Reservoir Dogs beat you at your own game.

1272
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:25,060
The Nintendo DS is looking to one-up the competition even though they don't exactly need it.

1273
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:28,220
They're doing pretty well on the market right now, however, you may have heard that there

1274
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:35,380
is a new Opera browser coming out for the DS in Japan, but it's coming out just in less

1275
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,900
than a month.

1276
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:43,380
There is a Japanese website, Nintendo Japan has a website that talks all about the new

1277
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:53,380
The browser will support stylus-based controls for scrolling, going between pages, inputting characters with handwriting or a keyboard on there.

1278
01:20:53,380 --> 01:21:01,380
However, the bad news is the browser won't be able to display Flash, won't be able to do PDFs, and it's not going to do video or sound.

1279
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:05,380
So, no YouTubing on your Nintendo DS. Sorry, kids.

1280
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:10,380
Well, hopefully it's still a start. I hope it supports, like, good JavaScript, because

1281
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:14,700
then you can still do, like, you know... I know they already have homebrew for it, but...

1282
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,380
The first PSP browser didn't support a lot of that either, so...

1283
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:20,100
Well, the PDFs still aren't supported on there.

1284
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,740
Yeah. In, I don't know, whatever, but still though,

1285
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,940
I mean... It's better than nothing.

1286
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:32,020
You might be able to program a chatroom out of that, or an MIRAC client.

1287
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,820
we're gonna have to do olrds.com sound like a project you want to do Loki we

1288
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:41,860
can just do a portable yeah sure why not all right that's the spirit I wonder if

1289
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,180
like when screen works I know everyone's gonna say what are you gonna add more

1290
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:50,020
stuff to olrps.com soon I didn't know people were still visiting that no I'm

1291
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,780
kidding I actually actually it does still get quite a bit of traffic we have

1292
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:57,860
fans that download the show on PSP you know what and you know I bless them for

1293
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:00,940
sticking with us when we've been pretty harsh on Sony we've been giving them a

1294
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:04,820
good lashing on this show and you know bless you guys for sticking with us and

1295
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:08,820
realizing that we're just trying to see the big picture here. I've got Sony stuff, I've got two

1296
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:13,060
PSPs myself. And then PlayStation and PlayStation 2. I actually have like three

1297
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:20,140
PlayStations. I like my PlayStation 2. PlayStation 2. And my PlayStation 1. I have a stack of three old school

1298
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:25,860
PlayStations. Dan and I tore up a KB Toys trying to find one of the last ones

1299
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,980
that had the IO port in the back before they put out the new deal shocks. Alright

1300
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:36,220
Enough Sony penis talk, let's talk about what other sites you can browse on your Nintendo

1301
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,220
DS.

1302
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:41,260
Of course, you will want to visit first Dark Sakura's website of the week.

1303
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,860
So Dark Sakura, what website should the kids be looking at this week?

1304
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:50,780
Well, this site was sent to me by one of the lovely listeners whose email I read.

1305
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:59,980
kawainot.com k-a-w-a-i-i-n-o-t dot com kawaii for those who don't know any

1306
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:06,380
Japanese at all means cute so it's cuteknot.com this site is messed up basically it's

1307
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:11,500
called the comic for cute gone bad and just to describe some of this it's all

1308
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:17,200
really adorable really cutesy stuff like the one the page someone right now has

1309
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:23,320
necktie and smiling it's a four panel you know vertical comic it keeps going

1310
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:27,600
down and then the very last thing has the caption I'm slowly strangling you

1311
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,920
but my favorite one on here is actually the very very first one it has two

1312
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:37,800
little puff balls meeting up the person goes I'm a cloud and then nothing in the

1313
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:43,640
second panel and then their panel it says I'm a fart and the last panel is

1314
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:49,880
the cloud one goes at this site it really follows some of the potty humor

1315
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:56,400
but it's just so huh that yeah it earns website of the week great suggestion I

1316
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:00,160
I love potty humor so good I'm going to leave this particular one in the chat

1317
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:07,760
room good job good job all righty go potty humor where you won't find potty

1318
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:14,240
humor 99 nights and speaking of 99 nights you don't need a hard drive to

1319
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:21,000
play the game that was a boo-boo on the website staff at xbox.com fired

1320
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,660
somebody's getting fired actually it's just saying that they support a hard

1321
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:32,160
drive for game saves or a memory you know unit either way as long as you have

1322
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:36,760
that good but it is optimized for the hard drive so that's good to know but

1323
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:42,640
you don't need it so go out and buy the game when it comes out in August all

1324
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:47,440
right well this may be a little bit of potty humor I don't know but everybody's

1325
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,340
been wanting to check out what's under the Wii's flap you know there's that

1326
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,040
little flap on the Wii and everybody wants to peek under the flap and see

1327
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:59,560
what's there that's so hot all right well here's what's the latest internet

1328
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:02,200
rumor actually not so much a rumor I think this has been confirmed now what

1329
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,980
What is underneath that damn Wii flap?

1330
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:08,680
There was a tip on Go Nintendo.

1331
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,960
Working at the Nintendo booth this year at E3 after close on the last day, everyone was

1332
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,640
involved in the tearing down and boxing up of everything that was to be sent back to

1333
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,640
corporate.

1334
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,120
Once the systems were removed from their plexiglass houses, they were all laying there awaiting

1335
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,160
the box and proper packing materials.

1336
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:27,520
I flipped a lid down to see the SD card slot and sync button.

1337
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,920
When all the guessing as to what was under the flap was going on, I kept quiet because

1338
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,960
I didn't want to spoil the fun. So, I guess that's what it is. It's the memory card slot

1339
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,280
is there, as well as the, I thought I read somewhere that Reggie had confirmed that the

1340
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:47,320
GameCube stuff was there too. No, the GameCube is on top. Or, side, however you have that.

1341
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:51,140
It would be in, I guess, the picture where you're looking at the front, it would be on

1342
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:59,640
top. And, the memory card slot, he said that was under there as well. And people were suspecting

1343
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:04,600
there's another button under there, and the sync... OMG, another button! Oh no, sync button,

1344
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:10,000
which, you know, no it's not the sync up to your Nintendo DS, it's to, you know, sync

1345
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,560
up to your wireless controllers, just like the Xbox 360 has, so. I didn't even know there

1346
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,840
was a sync button on the Xbox 360. How'd you set up, oh yeah, you have wired controllers.

1347
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,320
Oh yeah, I have wired controllers, that's right, never mind. Yeah, you don't need to

1348
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:25,720
sync up. Well, when you get wireless controllers one of these days... I don't want wireless

1349
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:30,200
wireless controllers will get lost the couch will eat them I don't mind wired

1350
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,200
controllers I really don't USB I can use them on the computer I'm just saying

1351
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:42,600
that's what it is or so alright fine yeah but um you know I'm sure that

1352
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,040
there's got some more secrets you know but uh you know we'll just have to wait

1353
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:53,520
and see but speaking of stuff though that has been out before

1354
01:26:53,520 --> 01:27:00,520
Castlevania, apparently it's getting made into a movie by Paul W.S. Anderson.

1355
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,520
He did Mortal Kombat, didn't he?

1356
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,520
He did Resident Evil.

1357
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,520
Didn't he also do Mortal Kombat? I'm almost positive he did.

1358
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:12,520
Now, Castlevania, he's not gonna shoot until he's done with the Death Race 3000 Remake.

1359
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:19,520
Or, Death Race 3000 Remake, which is actually Death Race 2000, but I guess it'll be called Death Race 3000.

1360
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,440
Which I am so stoked to see that movie, because if you've ever watched Death Race 2000, it's

1361
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,440
completely cheesy.

1362
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:33,840
It has Sylvester Stallone in it, and it has David Carradine, who has a hand grenade.

1363
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,640
That's his hand.

1364
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:39,920
And there's lots of unnecessary nudity and violence.

1365
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,320
It's basically a movie that would have inspired Carmageddon.

1366
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,680
So just take it as that.

1367
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:51,480
roll out old grannies into the street and they run through them with you, and kill people.

1368
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:56,400
So that's why it's Death Race. Must watch the DVD. It's on PSP too. Anyways, um...

1369
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,520
And it just has what to do with Castlevania? Oh, I just like Death Race. But he's gonna

1370
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:06,940
make the game, and he says it's gonna basically be a, kind of a, I don't know if you'd say

1371
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:13,120
a reinterpretation, but it's basically gonna cover the origins of the Belmont family and

1372
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:17,400
Dracula and all that fun stuff and he's also going to do DOA

1373
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,720
the

1374
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,960
Horrible horrible movie. He didn't do that movie. Did he?

1375
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,920
Yes, Anderson did apparently no

1376
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,240
No, somebody else did that movie didn't he? I'm looking on

1377
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,720
IMDB right now. You do you tell us the updates all tell Jeremy Bolt. I'm sorry. Thank you

1378
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,760
okay, but uh

1379
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,980
Yeah, I don't know it's it's

1380
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:44,420
interest help I don't know

1381
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,660
are the updates what's new and alive now it's coming out

1382
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:52,940
well what incredible to make a sequel to it also

1383
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:57,260
but the movie has even come out yet what if it flops

1384
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:01,220
who cares I'm most happy about Resident Evil movie because I actually do like

1385
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:02,380
Resident Evil Apocalypse

1386
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:05,580
night and see it yeah they're this is basically

1387
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:09,180
I'm bolt confirms that I'm

1388
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:15,580
Or Bolt's head. I guess Bolt might be the company. I don't know. I'm stupid. Jeremy

1389
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:20,340
Bolt. Anyways. Where's the lion? Who cares? It's coming out with a sequel to this movie

1390
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:25,760
that's crap. Well, wait a minute. It's like Charlie's Angels 2. Look, you haven't seen

1391
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,140
the movie yet. Crap. I saw it at the trailer. But the trailer did suck. I'll give you that.

1392
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:36,660
I'm gonna answer this question because Loki can't frickin' do his research. Hey. Directed

1393
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:43,660
by Corey Ewan. Does that say Anderson to you? No, it's Corey Ewan. Good job, Loki. So what?

1394
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:49,420
Hooked on phonics, works for Loki. Doesn't matter. It's gonna suck anyways. Okay, I've

1395
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:53,260
been directed by me and it still sucks. Actually, no, my movie has been awesome. It would have

1396
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:57,620
been triple X and they're all being naked. Alright, I need some callers to call in and

or daddy's permission if you're not the one paying the phone bill. While we

1402
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:27,240
wait for a phone call, I'd like to ask if there's any last-minute stories.

1403
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:31,200
There's a story on the internet about how awesome I am.

1404
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,200
Sure there is. Also how modest and... Oh look we have a call!

1405
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:40,160
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this? This is DMN and Loki, I think the

1406
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,120
idea of putting

1407
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:45,240
porn stars in a Dead or Alive movie has to have been the worst idea I've ever

1408
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,760
heard come out of your mouth.

1409
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,800
Wait a minute, why? I wouldn't... I don't want porn stars

1410
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:56,180
fucking up my fighting game. Your fighting game's already fucked up, have you seen

1411
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:56,880
the trailer?

1412
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,120
I'd stop playing after three

1413
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:05,420
Because I don't want to get a 360. Oh, that's right. Okay, you're in you're like

1414
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,460
You're the ultra ist of Nintendo fanboys though

1415
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:15,420
This this is not true. Just because I work at Nintendo does not mean I'm a Nintendo fanboy

1416
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:19,960
So you you in the next-gen Wars, which console are you gonna buy?

1417
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:24,280
First, I'm buying a Wii just because I conveniently work at Nintendo.

1418
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,800
Okay, but is there going to be a second?

1419
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:31,120
If somebody puts a gun to my head, I will probably crack, excuse me, I will probably

1420
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,120
break down and buy a 360.

1421
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,160
No love for PS3?

1422
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:42,280
No because I had a little light for him, but after what I was reading about Kazurai calling,

1423
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,400
being the pot calling the kettle black, that's not happening anymore.

1424
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,400
Okay.

1425
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:51,940
What did you want to call in about tonight, besides berating Loki, which I appreciate?

1426
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:55,460
I've seen the Wii.

1427
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:57,000
You have seen Wii?

1428
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,400
I have seen Wii and I have not seen it in my department, so I can talk about it.

1429
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,040
They were doing a little retail tech demo of it at corporate.

1430
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,480
It looked pretty cool.

1431
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,760
I want to test it.

1432
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,120
I'm really excited.

1433
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,780
Let me ask you a vague question, if you don't want to answer that's fine.

1434
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:22,340
Did you see anything that we didn't see at E3?

1435
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:27,880
I only saw people playing it, I didn't get a chance to see any screens, but they looked

1436
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:32,400
like they were genuinely enjoying using that software and the hardware.

1437
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,840
Oh, these are real people, not actors, because you know...

1438
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,840
These are real people.

1439
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,840
Oh wow, okay.

1440
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,840
Okay.

1441
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,120
Well, you know, but a lot of people at E3 had a lot of fun with it.

1442
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,440
I did, I had fun with Wii at E3.

1443
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,480
I'm definitely buying one hell yeah oh yeah I am too

1444
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,080
just for the price alone because I know it's gonna be under 250

1445
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,920
there's no question alright anything else on your mind tonight

1446
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,560
Mr. Diamin? happy birthday you suck for not staying in Seattle longer than two

1447
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,320
hours

1448
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:02,760
it's a layover give me a break

1449
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,920
alright well thank you for the birthday wishes I appreciate it too bad I went

1450
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,560
and got sunburned all over my scalp

1451
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:14,080
on my birthday and now it's all gross and peeling and nasty so

1452
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,000
I'll leave you with those happy thoughts, alright?

1453
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,200
Alright, take care guys. Have a good one buddy. Bye.

1454
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:24,520
Later. Any other last minute stories anyone would like to share?

1455
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:29,640
Oh wait, never mind, we got another call. Wow, that was quick. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1456
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:33,880
Hi. Hi. It's Ravenstaufen. Wow, you call every week and you manage to get through.

1457
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:36,200
You've got the luck. Well, what's on your mind, Ravenstaufen?

1458
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,200
I can't believe I missed this!

1459
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,200
You missed what?

1460
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,200
Orange Lounge Radio.

1461
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,200
Oh, well, we didn't really play up the fact that we were taping on Thursday this week.

1462
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,200
You know, life goes on.

1463
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,200
What did you think of the show you heard so far?

1464
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,200
You can download the rest on Sunday like everyone else.

1465
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,200
I guess I have two things a lot, Sky...

1466
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,200
Oh, it's tough about that.

1467
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,200
I just called in to say...

1468
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,200
What was I supposed to call in to say?

1469
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,200
Uh, Phoenix Wright Rules.

1470
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,200
Okay.

1471
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,480
What else?

1472
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:11,140
The Xbox. Oh, do you have any problems with the Xbox hooking up to your PC?

1473
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:14,220
Nope. No, mine worked fine.

1474
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:18,520
What kind of problems are you having with the Xbox and the PC? Well, I just don't want to

1475
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,120
do it.

1476
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,240
Do you have Service Pack 2 installed

1477
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,800
on your PC? Yeah, I got everything. I just don't want to do it.

1478
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:32,760
It's been so long since I did it. I don't even remember what the process was.

1479
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,240
what point in the process like are you trying to sink it on you like you

1480
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,440
downloaded the program

1481
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,720
on the PC right yeah just doesn't see your xbox at all

1482
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,320
done see it was like hey nothing go to hell

1483
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,600
weird are you guys on wireless network yeah wireless wired

1484
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,800
do you have your xbox 360 hooked to a wireless

1485
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:55,040
router of its own because it's not gonna pick up just

1486
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,440
like it doesn't have Wi-Fi built inside it you have to have a separate

1487
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:01,840
yeah yeah okay I have to figure that out okay maybe that's what's wrong

1488
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,680
Oh, uh, I have one last thing to say.

1489
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,160
Okay. I'm trying to buy a PS3, can't

1490
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:13,920
can't say anything. Okay, well then why, what

1491
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,640
what is making you deciding to buy a PS3? Because of the blu-ray, I want to see

1492
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,680
how it works

1493
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:25,120
because they're having problems. You're gonna spend $500, $600 on a console to see how it works.

1494
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:30,480
Hey, I got, I got things, I have no time. Can't you just look at a demo or retail

1495
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,880
Make a decision there. No, I must take this home and destroy it

1496
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:37,920
See then you you don't sound like you just want you sound like a collector

1497
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:44,960
You sound like one of the hardcore dorks that has to have it all like dark Sakura myself. Yeah, that's kind of it

1498
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:50,400
That's why I still have my original gameboy in my gameboy color in my pocket. I have mostly there you go

1499
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,280
I knew you were a nerd only nerds listen to this show, right?

1500
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,400
Yeah, I guess all right any other thoughts Ravenstaufen only nerds who host the show

1501
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:06,200
Oh, not much. I just wanted to say that I can't believe I missed it. That's all right

1502
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:12,600
It's we'll be back. We're gonna pre tape next week's show on Saturday night because I have another I'm going back to LA

1503
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,560
It's crazy. Just I have a crazy schedule and I

1504
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:21,400
Appreciate dark soccer and Loki putting up with my crap schedule, but we'll be painting on Saturday next. All right

1505
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,300
All right, so be here if they buy. All right. Bye. Bye

1506
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:25,140
Bye.

1507
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:27,900
I'll see if anyone else wants to get through.

1508
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,020
We'll go for one more call.

1509
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,860
Does anyone have a last minute story they want to do?

1510
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,180
I have a couple last minute stories.

1511
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,820
Okay, what?

1512
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:36,420
Codemasters is working on trying to get a sensible,

1513
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,900
the original Sensible Soccer that was on Amigo,

1514
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,700
or Sensible World of Soccer, I'm sorry.

1515
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:43,060
It was actually supposed to be an unlockable

1516
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,780
in Sensible Soccer 2006.

1517
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,100
They couldn't do it, so they're actually trying to,

1518
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,720
there's talk about them putting a Sensible World of Soccer

1519
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,740
on Xbox Live Arcade.

1520
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:55,460
For our UK friends, by the way, hooray for new arcade games

1521
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:00,380
We had a call coming in so I'm gonna interrupt you before the second story. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1522
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:02,620
It's Ron. No, who else would it be?

1523
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:09,180
Now are you the one are you the one that gave up boners for Lant? No, that wasn't me. I was lucky. I know

1524
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:12,820
That would never be Loki. No, it was explicit

1525
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:19,620
All right, what's on your mind Rama do you wait a movie will rock because of one reason one reason only

1526
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:25,500
I don't know it is it because that chick from Sin City's in it. Yes. I knew it. I knew it

1527
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,900
I can read a straight guy's mind. I know exactly

1528
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:34,860
What's your face? She doesn't get naked too fast too furious isn't it to his costume II is this isn't that the same chick?

1529
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:36,860
I don't know. It's the same chick

1530
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,980
But you did you say City? No, okay. I saw it awesome

1531
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:46,140
I know Sin City was okay a little overrated by the dork culture. I think a little overrated

1532
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:51,140
I don't think it was all that but if Angelina Jolie truly isn't the second one. That's pretty hot because I actually

1533
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:56,100
Even though I hate tabloid news, and I have don't know what the fuck this has to do with gaming

1534
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:00,780
As much as I hate tabloid news all that stuff. I actually really like Angelina Jolie

1535
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:06,540
So well, she's supposed to be doing a pool made of three right now. So hey, okay

1536
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,540
Well, I guess that is game related then. Thank you

1537
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:12,220
Mm-hmm. So what else is on your mind besides making love to?

1538
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:19,660
uh whatever her name is Devon Devon Aoki what else is on your mind to say

1539
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:25,540
besides making sweet love to her the circuit city $8.96 massive fire sale oh

1540

1542
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:36,300

1543
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:42,660
Walmart for 18 that wasn't me that was uh several 1215 SSJ 100 Matt I can't do

1545
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:49,100
don't know if I'd read it on the forums or where the hell I'd read that but I

1546
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:53,500
was like that's dirty that's dirty well what did you go to the sale did you pick

1550
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:15,420
So I'm going to get that price match. Wow, they have Dig Dug Strike. I kind of want that.

1551
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:23,740
I still have it sealed if you want it. Really? I don't want it. Send me an email. I do. I love Dig Dug.

1552
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:28,640
I I really been curious to check out the DS one. Why there's nothing else coming out this week

1553
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,500
Maybe maybe when my trips die down though

1554
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:34,080
I'm gonna check our local Circuit City and if they don't have it then I'll shoot you an email

1555
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,080
Yeah, and I also picked up Dr. Mario Puzzle League.

1556
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,080
Oh, how's that? Have you played any of those yet?

1557
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:43,080
It's not that. I'm a puzzle fanatic, so I'm enjoying it. It's helped me kill time on the subway.

1558
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:46,080
Is that the one that's combined with the Pokemon Puzzle League game?

1559
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:50,080
Yeah, but it's Puzzle League since the Pokemon franchise is not on the game.

1560
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:56,080
Oh. Well, you know, I like that. It was really Tetris Attack years ago. You remember that? The Yoshi Tetris Attack game?

1561
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,080
Oh, yeah.

1562
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:00,080
That's one of my favorite puzzlers, actually. I really like that game. Simple concept.

1563
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:07,040
That reminds me, Tetris DS should have been called Tetris Classic NES Edition.

1564
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:12,800
You know, Tetris DS, yeah, I mean, sure they hoard the NES stuff, but what's also interesting

1565
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,640
about it is that there was so much more there than just Tetris.

1566
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:19,640
I mean, that mode, I can't remember what it's called, but the Metroid one, with Metroid

1567
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:20,640
in the background?

1568
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:21,640
That was awesome!

1569
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,640
That's like a different game altogether.

1570
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:27,040
I'm playing through the game, I hear the remix from Gyro, I almost fell out of my seat, flipping

1571
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,840
out how awesome that was, and I realize, damn, I'm old.

1572
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:35,600
Nintendo knows how to milk their retro factor believe that right believe it anything else on your mind Rama

1573
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:42,360
Next Sunday when the sales official I'm gonna hit those circuit city stores again for two more games if they don't have it

1574
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,660
I'm bringing my papers. I'm going to Best Buy

1575
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:50,840
Target all in just a price match and track the games down all right keep us posted on your bargain hunting process

1576
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:56,240
Okay, all I will be all right. Have a good one Rama. Take care. I will stay away from those bonus on

1577
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,760

01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:05,000
Sweet room party, you know it. Yep. All right crazy kids. Have a good one. You too. Bye

1579
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,520

1580
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:13,900
Alright, that's all the calls for tonight kids. We're gonna start to wrap things up here with one more story

1581
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:19,440
Oh, I'm sorry. That's right. You had your last minute thing. I'm sorry. Yeah, and you completely cut me off. My bad

1582
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:23,760
Ron-chan is very well worth it. I have some news for our World of Warcraft players. Oh

1583
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,620
Then this is something I might want to know. Uh-huh. The realm transfer went live

1584
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:34,300
Five servers are supporting it right now is Altar of Storms, Argent Dawn, Demon's

1585
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:39,940
Soul, Alidian, and Warsong. Others are going to be following soon. European

1586
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:47,020
players should see it coming up not too far afterwards and again it is $25 to

1587
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:51,260
move between servers. Just check out Blizzard's site on worldofwarcraft.com

1588
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:59,800
Also, um, World of Warcraft Burning Crusade, the trailer is out, there is, uh, showing

1589
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:02,840
off what the new accessory in the game is.

1590
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:03,840
Flying mounts.

1591
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,880
Ooh, there's going to be a lot of people excited about that.

1592
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:15,760
The, uh, trailer is actually available on Eurogamer TV, if you go to, uh, Eurogamer.com,

1593
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:21,080
I'm sorry, Eurogamer.net slash TV video, there should be a link up there to it, and I'm going

1594
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:27,680
to be watching that shortly. Last up is Dance Factory. Basically it's trying to

1595
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,640
I guess dethrone dancing stage in the UK with dancing stage being DDR.

1596
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:37,000
It's this really crappy game that you can put it's made by Comaster. Yeah that's what I

1597
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,040
put in a CD and it generates steps for you. It's a neat concept it really is a

1598
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:48,760
neat concept however part of the part of the fun of DDR is you know the

1599
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:56,380
interesting things that Konami likes to pass us into music so that's my last

1600
01:42:56,380 --> 01:43:00,040
minute news all right unless you're interested in playing diner dash on your

1601
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:05,280
PSP actually I've played diner dash 2 on the computer don't ask me why I think

1602
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:10,160
because Loki was playing it at e3 yeah I want to play that and I actually I

1603
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,560
actually downloaded it how sad am I I actually have one more bit of news also

1604
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:17,560
So for our YouTube listeners, Disgaea 2 is coming out in the UK.

1605
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,560
Well I damn well hope so.

1606
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:24,560
That has a huge cult following to it, so good to hear.

1607
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,560
It looks pretty interesting at E3.

1608
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,560
Alright.

1609
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:28,560
So that's it, I promise.

1610
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,560
Okay.

1611
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,560
Dot com.

1612
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,560
Excellent.

1613
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:37,560
Anyways, we've got a last minute story here.

1614
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:38,560
Silent Hill.

1615
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:44,280
Of course, we know that the Japanese are really trying to promote the movie over there.

1616
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:56,380
And what's kind of interesting is they're doing this brand new kind of like cafe, Akihabara's,

1617
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:57,920
Made in Japan.

1618
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,760
That's pretty much the whole electronic district.

1619
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:08,200
Yeah, Made in Japan, and it's basically a cafe that's covered with Silent Hill posters,

1620
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:13,380
which are just everywhere and like all sorts of memorabilia including white

1621
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:19,680
nurse zombies in super short skirts serving red pyramid curry and tomato

1622
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:24,600
juice that's awesome I look in one of the pictures on that site they had the

1623
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:28,160
little pyramid head guy in the back did you post that in your life journal no

1624
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,960

01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:42,160
nurses are pretty hot they don't look like zombies all right well if you're in

1627
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:47,040
Japan check it out take pictures send them to us we can't go we're too poor

1630
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:08,400
the tomato juice and it has a picture of the pyramid head curry which looks very tasty

1631
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,400
actually.

1632
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:13,320
I don't know if you saw the movie it might not be so tasty.

1633
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:18,320
And a huge ass picture of red pyramids sitting in the background that's pretty hot.

1634
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:23,240

1643
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,360
I know. I'm getting to that.

1644
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,360
Well, fine.

1645
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,360
Well, fine then, DarkSakura. What's your final thought?

1646
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,360
Bite my butt, Rob.

1647
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:11,360
No. Reject false icons. Eat your red pyramid curry.

1648
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:14,360
My final thought is, I hope you washed it.

1649
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,360
Oh, baby, just for you.

1650
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:18,360
Loki, your final thought?

1651
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:21,360
I can't find this trademark and it's driving me nuts.

1652
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,360
I know it's here.

1653
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:28,360
The problem is it's really hard to search this stupid Japanese trademark database.

1654
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:52,240
Alright, have a great week kids, we'll see you next week for more Orange Lounge Radio.
