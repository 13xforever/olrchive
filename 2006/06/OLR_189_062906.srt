00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:21,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, the PlayStation 3 gets a website, Prey gets a release date, and what is the Wii hiding under that little flap?

2
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gamer news.

4
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,176
[SPEAKER_06]: and Gamer Culture as well.

5
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:08,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, there you go.

6
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:09,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, now we can hear you.

7
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:11,356
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you looking at over there on the laptop?

8
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:17,500
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been staring intently there for like... I'm trying to confirm something.

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one of the stories we're doing tonight?

10
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:20,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's quite important.

11
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:21,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sounds good.

12
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:25,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, we are a bit of a special episode this week.

13
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,828
[SPEAKER_06]: There is only going to be one part of this week's episode.

14
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:33,732
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not going to be a part A and part B. The reason for that is that we're taping far in advance this week.

15
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually Thursday evening when we're taping this week's show.

16
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Partially because I'm fleeing the country tomorrow.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be gone for just under a week.

18
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're pre-taping our live show on Thursday night.

19
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:46,902
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live.

20
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:49,522
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody is listening to our regular live stream, we are here.

21
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:52,843
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in our chat room, which is on a brand new server, might I add.

22
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on a brand new chat server.

23
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,524
[SPEAKER_06]: All the details are over at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.

24
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We've moved from Other Side IRC to Game Surge.

25
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:00,121
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

26
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,740
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week was a lot of Dead or Alive 4.

27
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,541
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it, as in that's all everybody played when I got home from work yesterday.

28
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:46,884
[SPEAKER_08]: My husband's cousin and his girlfriend were over, and then other people showed up, and so it was pinball slash Dead or Alive Fest all in our house.

29
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:53,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tried to play a little Warcraft, and I'm going to probably start on whatever server that is that you're on.

30
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:56,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say it.

31
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:57,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my airy peak.

32
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Animal Crossing during a meeting at work

33
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Must not have been a very important meeting.

34
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:32,431
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was basically, just to give a little overview, the company I work for was purchased by another company.

35
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:33,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, fun.

36
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:40,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And they want to keep us, they want to keep everybody, it was good, but they're all like, they just announced it like the day before, and we're having this big HR meeting and crap.

37
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:45,419
[SPEAKER_06]: So me and Julie... Where was everybody doing the panicky, oh my god, Zoraga and Pink Slips?

38
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:51,162
[SPEAKER_08]: They're asking stupid questions that we all knew, they were reading off of the same stuff that was on the website at work.

39
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:54,070
[SPEAKER_08]: and then, oh, we can't answer that at this time.

40
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we don't know the answer to this at this time.

41
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sure information will be available as, you know, that type of crap.

42
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:09,734
[SPEAKER_08]: So me and customme19 and another one of our co-worker friends were sitting in the back and our friend was reading a book and we were playing Animal Crossing.

43
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:12,775
[SPEAKER_08]: We were sitting on the floor behind people.

44
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:13,775
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are going to get fired.

45
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:14,595
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

46
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:17,116
[SPEAKER_08]: She's been there longer than I have.

47
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:17,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

48
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:19,797
[SPEAKER_08]: She actually trained me at my job.

49
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:26,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to ask why all the dead are alive for?

50
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was on when I came home.

51
00:04:29,383 --> 00:04:30,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on!

52
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:30,764
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on!

53
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Bouncy boobs, it's what's on the tube.

54
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:38,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff's girlfriend though, she's really good at the game.

55
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:42,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's best friend Eric, she was completely kicking his ass and he's such a masher.

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,142
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,821
[SPEAKER_06]: You could totally get away with button mashing on him.

58
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:10,702
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you knew his moves without mashing, then it was even better.

59
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,343
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, he's the mashers character.

60
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:15,183
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it in Tekken 4?

61
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:15,783
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a girl?

62
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Christy.

63
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,165
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like his student or some crap.

64
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I play with Huarong anyway.

65
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:25,686
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also mash with him too.

66
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,306
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

67
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,167
[SPEAKER_08]: But mine was always Jin and Julia.

68
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never forget old school button mashing.

69
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:36,293
[SPEAKER_06]: When I used to play Street Fighter 2 back in the day.

70
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:36,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing Honda?

71
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:38,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, eHonda, exactly.

72
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's crazy, yes.

73
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Because all you had to do was hit the buttons a bunch.

74
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,955
[SPEAKER_06]: You did that hand thing.

75
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,055
[SPEAKER_08]: How would she move?

76
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:48,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Though he also had the charging stuff too.

77
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:48,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

78
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:51,637
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same deal with Blanka, just electrocute, electrocute, electrocute.

79
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:54,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Chun-Li did the feet thing too.

80
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:54,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

81
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:57,419
[SPEAKER_06]: The old days of cheese.

82
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I ever tell you about the time...

83
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:00,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Storytime with Rob

84
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:31,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that game, and I wasn't a huge Street Fighter player, but I was on that game, and I was kicking all these guys' asses with Chun-Li for like an hour straight.

85
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, some girl came up and also used Chun-Li and worked me.

86
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, she owned me.

87
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:43,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never forget her, although, well, I don't remember her name, but, you know.

88
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:50,242
[SPEAKER_08]: My days of massive pwnage on fighting games, I have three major milestones.

89
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:50,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

90
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,443
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was me and my friend Marcy.

92
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:14,890
[SPEAKER_08]: We were like the killer instinct people.

93
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We would trade off and just like own guys all day.

94
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:19,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I've told the story many times.

95
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:24,697
[SPEAKER_08]: My Tekken 3 escapade at Cyber Station in Mobile, Alabama at Bel Air Mall.

96
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:25,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

97
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:27,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I got in there.

98
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you've told this on the show before, I think.

99
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, these guys have been in there playing from like 10 a.m.

100
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:35,378
[SPEAKER_08]: to 2 in the afternoon, doing nothing but King, playing his throws over and over.

101
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, I want to play.

102
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So I shoved one of them off the machine and played Julia and kept beating them because she has the combo block, the throw blocks.

103
00:07:44,520 --> 00:08:01,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Killer Instinct, my god, I haven't played that game in forever I really want to play that game, like right now And then Killer Instinct 2 came out when I lived in the dorms So we would go over to the bar, it was like a bar deli arcade And we'd just play Killer Instinct 2 all night What was the name of the skeleton guy?

104
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:13,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was the guy I always used I know, sad I don't remember the name I know who you mean, Spinal Yes, Spinal I'll never forget that Combo Breaker

105
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:16,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

106
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,149
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

107
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

108
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:21,571
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

109
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a little bit more of Blazing Angels.

110
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:26,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost finished with that game now, finally.

111
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, though, because all the achievements kind of get unlocked at the same time.

112
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you get an achievement for if you ace all the missions, you get something.

113
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:39,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Then as you finish the game, I think your rank ends up being, like,

114
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Corporal, or whatever it needs to be.

115
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all the medals.

116
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:51,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ace all the missions, you unlock like four achievements at the same time, which is most of the achievements in the game anyways.

117
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm trying to beat this game for achievements.

118
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,761
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

119
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:57,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Points, whore!

120
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:04,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've been playing the Chromehounds demo, and that was pretty fun.

121
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:06,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that wasn't released in the US.

122
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you have an account somewhere else, don't you?

123
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

124
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

125
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

126
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everybody knows you can get an account in another country.

127
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:15,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I just set up an account for Japan.

128
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:18,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you download, you can play it with any account.

129
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:19,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

130
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all in English anyways.

131
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't there a 99 Nights demo in Japan?

132
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:24,870
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

133
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was.

134
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Love Football.

135
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:28,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.

136
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only other demo that we don't have.

137
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:34,104
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, though, I mean, it's all in English.

138
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:35,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, completely.

139
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:41,647
[SPEAKER_04]: You can select different languages, I guess, initially or whatever, but it's all in English.

140
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:45,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't understand why they didn't release it over here.

141
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid, but whatever.

142
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:48,149
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still get it.

143
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:55,472
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, on Major Nelson's blog earlier this week, he talked about why, or there's like an FAQ, why don't things come to certain regions?

144
00:09:55,552 --> 00:10:00,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's always like licensing, permission, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.

145
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:02,315
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the internet.

146
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,535
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

147
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:05,256
[SPEAKER_04]: They're downloading it now for your servers.

148
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, people are getting it anyway, so it doesn't matter.

149
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:07,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

150
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:08,137
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it matter?

151
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:11,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a lot of the feedback I read on the demo was really negative, but you enjoyed it?

152
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,360
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because they're stupid and they don't understand.

153
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,541
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that these mechs represent all the mechs in the game.

154
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:17,522
[SPEAKER_04]: They're slow.

155
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,903
[SPEAKER_04]: The mechs are heavy mechs that move slow.

156
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:22,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not like Speed Racer mechs.

157
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:23,885
[SPEAKER_04]: The mechs are slow by...

158
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:47,653
[SPEAKER_04]: you can make lighter mechs that are faster or you have these heavier mechs which are damn slow and that's the two missions there's a sniping mission and like a soldier mission and they're both with heavy mechs and they're like these mechs move so slow it's gonna be 15 seconds to turn around yeah it's a heavy mech it's supposed to move slow because it's armored as hell you can get a light mech or a mech with like you know hovercraft bottom or wheels or whatever and it moves fast

159
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:50,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's story time on Orange Launch Radio, but I don't give a shit.

160
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:53,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever play at Dave & Buster's, the mech game they have there?

161
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it back when it was at BattleTech in Virtual World.

162
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it when it was over at American Life.

163
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things were really slow, but it was fun.

164
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:05,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

165
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because, you know... I beg to differ.

166
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:09,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I got motion sick.

167
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you get motion sick, and that's a whole other Oprah.

168
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:12,621
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know...

169
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:18,147
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't have that, wouldn't you agree that the game is somewhat fun, at least?

170
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:19,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhat.

171
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:19,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there you go.

172
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:21,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

173
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:24,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's a fun game.

174
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:24,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

175
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And the multiplayer is going to be awesome.

176
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:28,399
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got the online...

177
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:31,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

178
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:07,748
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing a lot of things with this, and this is kind of positioning itself to be like the next, you know, Mecha Assault, you know, game, and that's what kind of people are looking for.

179
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:08,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

180
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:10,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

181
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Grand Theft Auto.

182
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,032
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been playing more of that still.

183
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:24,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, was it Vice City Stories has a date now, October 18th, which is about when the last one came out, so it's not...

184
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:34,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they're not because they're fucking lazy but they better fix the multiplayer because it's really messed up.

185
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So playable but really messed up.

186
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,426
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week was actually not that exciting.

187
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:47,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I did mention during Jamie's gaming week I played World of Warcraft and I did do an instance this week.

188
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:54,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Horde's first instance is always the Ragefire Chasm and so I did that instance this week and that's fun.

189
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,513
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

190
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:14,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Burnout

191
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:33,692
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm finding it's kind of hard to get the achievements in Burnout.

192
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:44,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I am having a hard time getting perfects on a lot of those early races, but I find that what you can do is you play a ways and you get the really nice cars and then you go back to the first levels and use the nice cars to beat them.

193
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:45,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

194
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:47,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot one more part of my week, actually.

195
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it, because I don't have anything else.

196
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,061
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

197
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:49,441
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

198
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to actually bring it and play it on my laptop.

199
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:57,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a game, an advanced copy to review.

200
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:57,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

201
00:13:57,978 --> 00:14:00,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be doing a review on Dragon's Lair HD.

202
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:06,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be on the stuff.orangenounsradio.com blog.

203
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody should keep their eyes on our board for when I post.

204
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:14,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

205
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: You were talking about that on last week's show, I know.

206
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it arrived.

207
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:19,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to checking that out.

208
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:20,980
[SPEAKER_08]: The box is very nice.

209
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to let me play with your copy?

210
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:23,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course!

211
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:24,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

212
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:29,946
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was planning on trying to hook up my laptop to our widescreen TV and see how it looked on that.

213
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:31,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

214
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:33,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon's Lair.

215
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:36,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's get into the news.

216
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wants to start us off tonight with some news?

217
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,514
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think that I could do that.

218
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:42,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

219
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:43,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to try really hard, though.

220
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:52,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what has officially launched other than a few ships going out to sea?

221
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:53,312
[SPEAKER_06]: No idea.

222
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:55,253
[SPEAKER_08]: The official PS3 site.

223
00:14:56,408 --> 00:15:22,926
[SPEAKER_08]: actually both US and UK I haven't bothered checking every other country I assume that it's come out for the US though it is www.us.playstation.com.ps3 for UK it's actually I guess it's eu.playstation.com.ps3 and it's got all the beginning stuff on it any new information at all?

224
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:25,526
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

225
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks just really cool.

226
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Ours is sort of, look, it's a PlayStation 3.

227
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:04,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Theirs is like sleek black stuff with flash animation and reflection.

228
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:05,828
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so awesome.

229
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:07,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, I can't stand it.

230
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:07,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a hot dog.

231
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:09,609
What?

232
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:12,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie is a joke.

233
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was like, PlayStation 3, can't stand it.

234
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:16,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a hot dog.

235
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,570
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.

236
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm still looking at stuff.

237
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:21,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways.

238
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to mess everything up.

239
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the PlayStation, this is more kind of on the PSP, though.

240
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:37,457
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that they're going to be able to support up to 7,000 PlayStation 1 games with the new emulator, which pretty much is every game out there.

241
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:39,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, there were 7,000 PlayStation games?

242
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,420
[SPEAKER_04]: There were not 7,000 games.

243
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,702
[SPEAKER_04]: There were 7,000 different versions of games, so...

244
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:47,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, that's their way of saying they're going to be able to support every single game.

245
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:50,392
[SPEAKER_04]: A few holes in that whole statement there.

246
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that sounds like?

247
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:59,897
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember those old 64-in-1 cartridges that were on the NES, and like 20 of them were just Contra with different color players?

248
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:01,098
[SPEAKER_08]: All kinds of different hacks.

249
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:02,999
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what this sounds like to me when they say 7,000.

250
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I personally own a few hundred myself.

251
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but still, 7,000?

252
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:07,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's...

253
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:13,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what the UK PSP magazine is reporting.

254
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:17,892
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say more around all the games that were on the system.

255
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:19,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my only thing about that though.

256
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:24,981
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP does not have a second analog stick and the PSP only has one L and one R button.

257
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:28,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the very first PS1 controller didn't have an analog stick at all.

258
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:29,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

259
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:37,970
[SPEAKER_04]: True, but if it's going to be supporting all the games, there are games that require the analog stick, and a lot of those games do use the L1 and L2 buttons.

260
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:42,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that eliminates a lot of that 7,000 there.

261
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:46,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Dumbasses freaking promising the world.

262
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:49,934
[SPEAKER_04]: But, they do have a good selection of stuff that they are promising.

263
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:52,254
[SPEAKER_04]: These are going to be available when they launch.

264
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:58,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, Silent Hill, and Tomb Raider.

265
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:03,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to see another Tomb Raider since they were doing the remake anyways, and Tomb Raider sucks.

266
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it was a groundbreaking PlayStation game.

267
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomb Raider Legends is actually fairly decent.

268
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:09,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the new one, right?

269
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it at all.

270
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like Tomb Raider.

271
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:16,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I did like breaking her, you know, by throwing her off the cliff.

272
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:24,270
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that was all about Tomb Raider 2, where you can make her explode, lock the butler in the walk-in freezer, and then make her jump off the balcony where she breaks her neck.

273
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,651
[SPEAKER_08]: The sound was fantastic.

274
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best.

275
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:32,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best.

276
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:59,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they like pushing the digital distribution thing, so why not?

277
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,050
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

278
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for Castlevania Symphony of the Night being on that list.

279
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably the best PlayStation game, in my opinion, period.

280
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:07,391
[SPEAKER_06]: The best PlayStation game.

281
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:09,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo for no Intelligent Cube.

282
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:11,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these are only five.

283
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:12,132
[SPEAKER_04]: They can go to hell.

284
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:15,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, maybe one of the 7,000.

285
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:19,854
[SPEAKER_08]: What we need is freaking Einhound.

286
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,215
[SPEAKER_06]: How come Ridge Racer wasn't on that list?

287
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:27,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was the big thing that they were touting at E3 was Ridge Racer.

288
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's just a given.

289
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:38,305
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, anyway, I have to mention, speaking of Ridge Racer, there is a brand new Ridge Racer title coming to the PSP.

290
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Rid Racer 2.

291
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:39,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Rid Racer.

292
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:40,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Racer 2.

293
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I edit that out?

294
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridge Racer 2 in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.

295
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:01,786
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to start off with the last game left off.

296
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:09,129
[SPEAKER_06]: It will have a return of the Nitro system as well as all the drift-based racing that makes Ridge Racer what it is.

297
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:14,869
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what it is?

298
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:17,650
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't say it, Ridge Racer, then I can't say it at all.

299
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,490
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem now.

300
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,051
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing about Ridge Racer, each game's been exactly the same as the last one.

301
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,772
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, it has not.

302
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so it's R4.

303
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:28,993
[SPEAKER_08]: R4 was the best of them.

304
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:29,813
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't let me finish.

305
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,614
[SPEAKER_06]: There are new modes.

306
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,656
[SPEAKER_06]: as opposed to Ridge Racer 1 on the PSP.

307
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:44,598
[SPEAKER_06]: There is, of course, the returning World Tours, Time Attack, Wireless, but now there is Arcade, Duel, and Survival Mode.

308
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:52,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And Arcade Mode is kind of like an arcade racing game where you try to get to a goal in a certain amount of time and then you get more time as you get to each checkpoint.

309
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:53,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Survival is where you play chicken.

310
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:56,582
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fun.

311
00:20:56,862 --> 00:21:00,403
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be like Twisted Metal Ridge Racer.

312
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:09,790
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so anyway, rumor is the game is 70% complete, and the Japanese release should be September 14th.

313
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

314
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:24,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Ridge Racer and Sony, Sony is actually claiming that Microsoft is copying them, that they are completely cloning the PlayStation 3 with the Xbox 360.

315
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:29,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm not sure where in that argument that makes sense.

316
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:36,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing as the PlayStation 3 is not even out yet, I'm not sure what this is all... I mean, is it the camera and the eye toy thing?

317
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,109
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this was an interview that was done in the official PlayStation magazine.

318
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:40,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

319
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That won't be biased at all, I'm sure.

320
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, yeah, okay.

321
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says, brings up how everyone is comparing Microsoft to Sony.

322
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:56,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Sony rep claims as soon as they do something, they see Microsoft trailing behind them, following their strategies.

323
00:21:58,097 --> 00:21:59,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh, that's kind of funny.

324
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:02,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give them credit on one thing.

325
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,560
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing only.

326
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,002
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that they have dual analog sticks on the controller.

327
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:09,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about it.

328
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:14,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, that's, you know, I think that was the first system, the PlayStation, to do that.

329
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:16,773
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's about it.

330
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:17,973
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm giving them.

331
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:22,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the DualShock controller is easily one of the top three controllers of all time, you know.

332
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:30,961
[SPEAKER_06]: But in turn, wasn't the DualShock controller just a grown-up version of the Super Nintendo controller in a way?

333
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,883
[SPEAKER_04]: This was Kaz Hirai's...

334
00:22:36,345 --> 00:23:04,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess and another quote that was taken from the interview here and the other thing is you look you take a look at for example the fact that we incorporate the blu-ray drive from day one you're not going to be asking me so talk to me about this blu-ray add-on that you have does it work for games is it just for movies that's exactly the kind of pitfall you fall into if you launch something that's too early to premature no

335
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,581
[SPEAKER_04]: You're launching a year late.

336
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:08,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Gag order, Sony.

337
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I've said it before on this program.

338
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody needs to stop talking right now.

339
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:16,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's working for Nintendo.

340
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them talk, but they don't talk as much as you do.

341
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

342
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:23,453
[SPEAKER_04]: They're copying a lot of people.

343
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:28,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to admit, the whole live thing... Granted, it's a great business model.

344
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,778
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't say they're completely original.

345
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: They're copying the business model, basically.

346
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to make it their own...

347
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:36,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's fine, okay?

348
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:42,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's something that needs to be done, just like the controllers look kind of the same, they're pretty much the same nowadays.

349
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:47,997
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine, but don't go and claim that you're the one that created it when your system's not even out there yet.

350
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:58,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, we don't even know what their online marketplace is like, and to say that, oh, well, Microsoft ripped us off, well, that's kind of impossible to do if you don't, you know, you can't rip off the future.

351
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:02,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there some rumor going around this week, and I apologize if I'm

352
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiling somebody else's story for later in the show, but I don't remember this coming up.

353
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:13,451
[SPEAKER_06]: But I seem to recall something about the Xbox 360 had hinted that they wanted to add something to their controller.

354
00:24:14,232 --> 00:24:20,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's some type of... It was kind of pointing like they might do motion sensing in their controller.

355
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:21,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't see that happening.

356
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:22,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I heard that.

357
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:25,676
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I think I heard it on another show or something.

358
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:29,518
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some other stories that we'll have that kind of hints that they're copying...

359
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: and more.

360
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:47,739
[SPEAKER_06]: from Kaz Harai.

361
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:57,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally speaking, over the past 12 years or so, there has been a consumer expectation that disc-based games are maybe $59 on the high end to $39 on the low end.

362
00:24:58,068 --> 00:25:04,654
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I can say now is, I think it would be a bit of a stretch to think that we could suddenly turn around and say, PlayStation 3 games now $99.99.

363
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:09,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think consumers expect software pricing to suddenly double.

364
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:18,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So the quick answer is that we want to make it as affordable as possible knowing that there is a set consumer expectation for what software has cost the past 12 years.

365
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,511
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of the best answer I can give you.

366
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:24,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it becomes a bit higher than $59, don't ding me.

367
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:25,833
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I don't expect it to be $100.

368
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:26,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So you mean...

369
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:33,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, and I don't want to sound like a broken record.

370
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:37,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, I am trying to find the good side of the whole Sony argument here.

371
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,488
[SPEAKER_06]: There's what?

372
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:00,803
[SPEAKER_04]: No, come on.

373
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible.

374
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:05,725
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why people say we're anti-Sony, Jamie.

375
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, I owned a Sony PlayStation.

376
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:09,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I owned a PlayStation 2.

377
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, fuck Xbox.

378
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:11,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying an Xbox.

379
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:12,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I did too.

380
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I was right there with you.

381
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, fuck Xbox when it first came out.

382
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:28,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And even still, when the PlayStation 3, when they were talking about it originally, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to own a PlayStation 3 and an Xbox 360 because I love the PlayStation 3 games and stuff, and it sounds cool.

383
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:29,251
[SPEAKER_04]: But

384
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the E3, it was like, you lost me.

385
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:34,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Crazy World over there.

386
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:38,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is... I think the expectations were met perfectly.

387
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to basically say, our games, you have to understand, you're paying for HD games, you're paying for...

388
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Games that have higher development costs.

389
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:50,983
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying for media that's $20 for blanks or whatever.

390
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,445
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why the games are more expensive.

391
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:54,926
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to pay for this.

392
00:26:54,966 --> 00:27:01,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, when people are developing games on both platforms, and it's even been said before, you can't tell the difference between them.

393
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:01,850
[SPEAKER_04]: So why the hell?

394
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:10,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is also, Microsoft is doing the same thing with the Xbox and Xbox 360 games, especially at launch, that were only slightly different, OK?

395
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I pay more money for a game that looks exactly the same and probably plays exactly the same on a system that's even more expensive?

396
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:21,614
[SPEAKER_04]: People aren't, and you know what?

397
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a problem for them.

398
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:27,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that argument seems a little Nintendo fanboy-ish to me for some reason.

399
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:31,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, the way you phrase that makes it sound like you're all about the Wii in that way.

400
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:34,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is okay, I mean, you're into whatever you're into.

401
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:43,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying if they are going to be pushing a system that this is, you know, the games are $79, I better see a vast improvement between that and the 360 version.

402
00:27:43,102 --> 00:27:45,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Those games better do my fucking dishes if they're going to be $80.

403
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:45,603
[SPEAKER_06]: That's insane.

404
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:54,702
[SPEAKER_06]: At least 360 has $5 games on their marketplace that kick butt.

405
00:27:55,443 --> 00:28:00,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see stuff that they were showing in those E3 videos or whatever.

406
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:03,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Game Developer Conference videos.

407
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:10,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my next Jak and Daxter game or Ratchet and Clank to look like a goddamn movie.

408
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:13,918
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to see if it's going to be this expensive.

409
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:16,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

410
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:18,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

411
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:19,575
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

412
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:20,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

413
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:26,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we don't know until about a month before or maybe two months before when the actual pricing is announced.

414
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,359
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you what.

415
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:34,642
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if that's their argument is that, oh, well, we have to price it this way because we're taking full advantage of the HD, da-da-da-da-da.

416
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you're taking full advantage of the HD, but how much of the marketplace is ready to take full advantage of the HD?

417
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:43,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot this year.

418
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:50,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this time next year even, or the year after, because with each Christmas, the price of the HDTVs are going to get lower and lower.

419
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:52,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll be ready to talk.

420
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:57,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, it's not like HD... I mean, I am an HDTV owner.

421
00:28:57,397 --> 00:28:59,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it, and I would highly recommend it to everybody.

422
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:05,702
[SPEAKER_06]: But looking at even just regular television, there's not a lot of embracing of HDTV yet.

423
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:09,144
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a whole lot of incentive to go to HDTV right now.

424
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're going with the Sony concept here...

425
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:16,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Your HDTV would not be good enough because it does not display 1080p.

426
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:19,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

427
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:20,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It might.

428
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It has HDMI.

429
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

430
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Not every TV is going to be able to.

431
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:27,092
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll actually say, usually in your manual that comes with your TV.

432
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:28,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then Sony can suck it.

433
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:29,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

434
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:31,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray for that.

435
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:34,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'll buy one anyway.

436
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:35,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to have one.

437
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:37,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to play Final Fantasy XIII.

438
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:38,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm that sad.

439
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:39,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I will buy the damn machine.

440
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:43,678
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll probably bitch about it if I'm not satisfied, you know?

441
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:45,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you're going to buy one too.

442
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,184
[SPEAKER_06]: You're sitting here all anti-Sony, I hate Sony, but you're going to buy one too.

443
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,527
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I was anti-Xbox and I bought one.

444
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:53,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, listen.

445
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I buy everything new that comes out.

446
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:57,654
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably buy a fucking 3D.

447
00:29:57,674 --> 00:29:58,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a GameCom.

448
00:29:58,996 --> 00:29:59,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I understand.

449
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:01,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a virtual employee.

450
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:02,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the same thing.

451
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to own it all.

452
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:05,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like Veruca Salt.

453
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:06,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine, mine, mine.

454
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, me, me.

455
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it all.

456
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

457
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing though.

458
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:10,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting it at launch.

459
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not getting it at launch.

460
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get 360 at launch and I turned out okay.

461
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:15,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

462
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:19,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just saying just based on what games are coming out right now.

463
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:20,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

464
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:25,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hate to bring this story to light because it's just...

465
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, you gotta wonder what crazy ass people they got working at Sony.

466
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:37,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, this news came from a website called Gamefront.de.

467
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:45,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a German site that has a lot of information on Sony PlayStation and the Wii and all that stuff.

468
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:54,724
[SPEAKER_04]: They noticed, and I was looking for it right before the show, that Sony has registered a patent in the Japanese patent office

469
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:55,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Poo's

470
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:27,419
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that the circles might actually represent the analog 6.

471
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:36,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you have here is them copying the Wii in the name of, but the controller is called... It's a PlayStation.

472
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:37,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I get PS.

473
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:38,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.

474
00:31:39,185 --> 00:31:43,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand, you know, with the little circles, I guess that could be kind of... The Poos?

475
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:45,788
[SPEAKER_06]: The Poos?

476
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:46,408
[SPEAKER_06]: The Poocon!

477
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:47,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Wii?

478
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Poocon!

479
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:48,869
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pooh and the Wii?

480
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:51,531
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the Xbox 360 going to come out with?

481
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:52,151
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sphincter!

482
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:52,531
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sphincter!

483
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:55,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's?

484
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:57,793
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell are they thinking?

485
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, show me the logo.

486
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

487
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:01,615
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you had a picture of it, right?

488
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:09,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a picture of the logo, and I will show it to you, and I will actually probably post this in our forum just so everyone can look at it.

489
00:32:09,818 --> 00:32:10,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

490
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:13,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Convince me this isn't fake.

491
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:21,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, because I look at this and I go, this is some anti-Sony person's idea of a really bad joke.

492
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:23,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at the website.

493
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:24,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't see.

494
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:30,621
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I couldn't look up the patent, or not the patent, the trademark on there, because I have no idea how to look up those trademarks on that website.

495
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:32,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't search by company or anything like that.

496
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:34,043
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to know the trademark number.

497
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:38,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I looked at their screenshot, and it looks like off that website.

498
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:41,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So granted, it could be an elaborate hoax or something like that.

499
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:42,867
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

500
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:10,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the morning that the Wii was announced?

501
00:33:10,565 --> 00:33:13,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Nintendo fanboys were like, oh, that's not right.

502
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:14,606
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lie.

503
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:15,627
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not called the Wii.

504
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop fucking with us, Sony fanboys.

505
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:18,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like having one of those moments.

506
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:22,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, seriously, you can't be calling this the poos.

507
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,350
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to realize what you're doing here.

508
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,771
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, that logo is too...

509
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:33,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's too simplistic to me.

510
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:34,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It screams fake.

511
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'd buy it.

512
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:36,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't.

513
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just going by what it looks like here.

514
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:41,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look so much like an Infinity, but it looks like an 8.

515
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:46,008
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously, because the left side is smaller than the right.

516
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:53,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what that might mean or whatever is, I don't know, have something to do with the tilting of it or something.

517
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

518
00:33:55,582 --> 00:34:22,235
[SPEAKER_04]: if they were showing it tilted it would have been at a completely different ratio I don't know what they're thinking but anyways I still call bullshit I don't think they're dumb enough to name their console the poos I'm looking and you know what I'll try to find this and I seriously think just looking at the screenshot that is a shot straight off that website I know just from browsing the website it looks exactly like it so you know what it could be a hoax but if

519
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

520
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be in there somewhere, and we should be able to find it.

521
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:32,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So, either way, you're going to find out pretty soon, and if it is, that's really weird.

522
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:34,328
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really weird.

523
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:35,048
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

524
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:35,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

525
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking that with a huge grain of salt.

526
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:46,075
[SPEAKER_06]: But if that turns out to be the real name, if we're back here next week with some type of confirmation stuff, I'm just going to shed more tears for Sony, because the poos.

527
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:48,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I realize, okay, it's an infinity sign.

528
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:51,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not OO, but you're saying that's how they've trademarked it, right?

529
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:51,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

530
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That's P space O-O space S is what it's on.

531
00:34:57,254 --> 00:35:00,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And that doesn't sound a little anti-Sony fanboy to you?

532
00:35:01,937 --> 00:35:03,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't sound... I don't know.

533
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:03,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it didn't.

534
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:15,248
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole story from them, and I don't have it translated, unfortunately, it was just saying that they had registered a patent for the controller, or a trademark for the controller, and...

535
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:21,209
[SPEAKER_04]: It says that they speculate, okay, the PNNS, of course, is PlayStation.

536
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:24,192
[SPEAKER_04]: The two circles are the analog sticks.

537
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:28,395
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't draw the distinction that it's naughty, you know, poo, you know.

538
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:29,556
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't laugh about it.

539
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:31,998
[SPEAKER_04]: They just, like, basically reported it as a story.

540
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:32,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

541
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:34,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had a picture of the logo on there.

542
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:38,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Our few chatters that are here today want to see the article for themselves.

543
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So link it in the chat room so you can see it.

544
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:50,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamefront.de And if you scroll down quite a bit, there's a story about the Eye of Judgment right below it.

545
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of poo.

546
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:57,334
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not just poo.

547
00:35:57,374 --> 00:35:59,475
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the poo of poo.

548
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:03,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Silly console names make us crazy and cause us to get a little angsty.

549
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: and that makes us want to get really, really angsty and do our FUs of the week.

550
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,727
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that sound, DarkSakura?

551
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:25,557
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week is actually not what it was going to originally be.

552
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:32,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually toward my work for having these stupid, retarded meetings for two hours about crap they don't know.

553
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what about our pension?

554
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,621
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know that yet.

555
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:39,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what about our thing?

556
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,102
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know that either.

557
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:42,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, but what about this?

558
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:46,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me read directly off of our website that's been posted for the last three days.

559
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:48,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh, people.

560
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:51,824
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two words for that meaning.

561
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:54,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Premature and pathetic.

562
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:55,925
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no call for it.

563
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:58,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's basically, I think, just to smooth things over.

564
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,187
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, all it did was, like, just piss people off.

565
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:02,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So, a big...

566
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:05,729
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to that stupid meeting, how pointless it was.

567
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,530
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, give us a meeting when we actually have some information on it.

568
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, the end.

569
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:24,633
[SPEAKER_04]: My F you is going to Sony because every day I read something crazy and crazier from them and it's such a disappointment.

570
00:37:27,674 --> 00:37:28,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was quick.

571
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,920
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to myself because I'm leaving the country tomorrow and I haven't even started packing.

572
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Go me!

573
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:35,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I rock.

574
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:39,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get a lot of laundry done though, so I'll at least smell clean when I go to Canada.

575
00:37:41,146 --> 00:37:42,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I hear they check for that at the border.

576
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Skye smell laundry fresh?

577
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,192
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

578
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:50,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on... Oh, that was you?

579
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:51,095
Um...

580
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:58,570
[SPEAKER_08]: There actually is a little bit of release news for our dear friends in the UK.

581
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:07,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Take-Two's game Prey has been announced to be released on July 14th, which is actually three days after we're going to get it here.

582
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:20,881
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also going to be a limited edition version for the PC, and there's a thing likely that there's going to be a demo for the Xbox 360 showing up on live pretty quick.

583
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:26,074
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another one of those things everybody's on Major Nelson's blog going, where's our Prey demo?

584
00:38:26,114 --> 00:38:26,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the demo?

585
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:28,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Street Fighter?

586
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:39,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, for anyone who doesn't know, Prey is, you're playing as a garage mechanic who gets kidnapped by aliens and has to save the world with his dead grandfather to guide him.

587
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, isn't that fantastic?

588
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,401
[SPEAKER_08]: That really makes me want to play Prey.

589
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to check it out.

590
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play that game so that I can throw up.

591
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because of motion sickness and all that?

592
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really care for first-person shooters.

593
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:55,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't liked a first-person shooter since Hexen, really.

594
00:38:56,484 --> 00:39:00,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played one a lot since Halo 2, probably, but I'll give it a shot.

595
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:02,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'll watch it.

596
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:03,928
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a lot of hype.

597
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,108
[SPEAKER_06]: There's got to be something about it.

598
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:12,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually could sit through Perfect Dark Zero without getting sick for a little while.

599
00:39:12,712 --> 00:39:14,673
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I tried to get into that and I just couldn't.

600
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:19,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm personally not too excited about Prey, however, I know some of our listeners are.

601
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hey, guess what?

602
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:20,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Prey's coming out.

603
00:39:21,553 --> 00:39:21,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

604
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that game looks actually pretty cool.

605
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:29,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have really awesome multiplayer, apparently.

606
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:37,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of multiplayer, actually, Oblivion's got another mod for the PC, and that's a multiplayer mod.

607
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:45,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of in alpha right now, but it allows you right now to basically exist in the same world with somebody else.

608
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:52,941
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're hoping that later on they're going to be able to add support up to eight players along with deathmatch and capture the flag.

609
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:55,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's kind of nifty.

610
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:56,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, Oblivion?

611
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:59,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Multiplayer Capture the Flag.

612
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:01,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird.

613
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:03,087
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy though.

614
00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:05,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody built multiplayer into Oblivion?

615
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:05,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

616
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:16,612
[SPEAKER_06]: You would think that they would want to put that in the game themselves and charge five bucks for it on Xbox 360 next to the horsey armor and all that stuff.

617
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:17,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

618
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:19,193
[SPEAKER_06]: If they were even to do that.

619
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:20,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't...

620
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:22,254
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a weird add-on.

621
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:26,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it sounds great, but that seems like it would change the game significantly.

622
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:31,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be pretty cool to go, not even if you can't do Deathmatch, but do co-op.

623
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:33,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Co-op would be pretty cool.

624
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:38,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's like a whole other idea for an Oblivion game, honestly.

625
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:46,599
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy that somebody built that into... That takes some real talent and skill and sleepless nights and coffee to be able to do.

626
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

627
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

628
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:48,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

629
00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:57,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Oblivion, kind of an exclusive here, another wonderful item appeared in my system at work.

630
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:59,275
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be Oblivion on the PS3.

631
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:02,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out currently at launch.

632
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:07,801
[SPEAKER_04]: My guess is probably after launch sometime, but it is coming.

633
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so why haven't we heard until today?

634
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything about that?

635
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I know.

636
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,811
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't watch the retails.

637
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:25,593
[SPEAKER_04]: They do watch GameSpot and EB, because I noticed my similar stories to the one we talked about on Sunday night have appeared on Monday Tuesday.

638
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:32,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they saw the box art from GameStop, apparently, which pulled it off their website, too.

639
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:36,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And funny enough, all those titles I said were correct.

640
00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:38,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whoo, heard it here first.

641
00:41:39,056 --> 00:41:39,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Except they didn't get the 100...

642
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:42,048
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

643
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Oblivion, of course, is a really big game on Xbox 360, but the biggest game on the regular Xbox was no doubt Halo 2.

644
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:12,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And when Halo 2 was first released, there was a company, Plantronics, and they created a special edition Halo 2 headset.

645
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:26,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It cost about $49.95 to $59.95, but the cool thing was that they were donating $1 of the proceeds to the Plantronics Gamecom United Way Katrina Relief Fund.

646
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:41,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know that doesn't sound like a whole lot of the cost, but something to note is that the price of those headsets has now dropped to $14.95 to $19.95 for your Xbox Communicator Special Halo 2 Edition.

647
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:42,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.

648
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:47,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of it goes to charity so you can feel good about yourself as you go kill people on Halo.

649
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, killing people is not a good thing to do.

650
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:56,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless they're in your way.

651
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

652
00:42:58,696 --> 00:43:10,198
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there are prisoners who are at Wakefield Prison in the UK who have to get rid of their PlayStation 2s.

653
00:43:10,818 --> 00:43:11,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boo-hoo.

654
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:14,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, being in prison, wow.

655
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:20,500
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically, there were inmates at this prison who,

656
00:43:20,982 --> 00:43:26,526
[SPEAKER_08]: who were found that they were watching porn on their PlayStation 2s.

657
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:28,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

658
00:43:29,027 --> 00:43:37,873
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they received 200 pounds each for every confiscated machine.

659
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:38,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

660
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:40,774
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like... Oh, so wait, wait, wait.

661
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:41,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait.

662
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:44,256
[SPEAKER_06]: They took them, but then they paid them for it?

663
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:44,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

664
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:44,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

665
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:48,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that great?

666
00:43:48,612 --> 00:43:49,213
[SPEAKER_06]: 200 pounds?

667
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:50,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a lot of money.

668
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:52,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, that's a lot.

669
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:54,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that more than what one costs new?

670
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah.

671
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:59,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a pound's worth more than a dollar right now, right?

672
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:04,742
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, yeah, for the nine prisoners who had theirs taken away, that's 1,800 pounds, you know.

673
00:44:04,902 --> 00:44:06,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now, did they have all the porn taken away, too?

674
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:08,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Because maybe that justifies why they were paid so much.

675
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:11,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they probably had some really impressive collections of pornography, I mean.

676
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:15,189
[SPEAKER_08]: But even so, keep in mind that this is probably coming out of the...

677
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:16,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Pockets of People.

678
00:44:16,775 --> 00:44:26,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the prison service is saying that they're refunding the prisoners because they bought the PlayStation 2s with their own money.

679
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:32,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's also been a mention that not compensating them might have been a breach of human rights.

680
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:33,544
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

681
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:39,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they breached the rights of whoever they violated when needed whatever crime they did to put themselves in jail.

682
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:41,908
[SPEAKER_08]: You're in jail as punishment.

683
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:43,469
[SPEAKER_08]: It shouldn't be happy fun time.

684
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,144
[SPEAKER_08]: They should get a brick wall with a toilet attached to it and a piece of board to lay on.

685
00:44:53,285 --> 00:44:54,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, not that bad.

686
00:44:55,086 --> 00:44:58,008
[SPEAKER_08]: But seriously, if you've killed somebody, yeah, you get a cell.

687
00:44:58,568 --> 00:45:00,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who knows what these people were?

688
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:03,050
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a maximum security case.

689
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,931
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have been drug criminals.

690
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,234
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying that among those that it was taken from, they were sex offenders.

691
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're watching porn.

692
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:12,950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's lovely.

693
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:13,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I get it.

694
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I had absolutely no sympathy for a sex offender.

695
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:21,812
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, it was quoted by Norman Brennan, who's the chairman of the Victim of Crime Trust.

696
00:45:22,612 --> 00:45:27,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It was quoted in the Yorkshire Post that it made a mockery of the whole criminal justice system.

697
00:45:29,013 --> 00:45:35,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, I don't know what to think about that.

698
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's kind of sad that they had him to begin with.

699
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:42,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, better porn than shower rapes, I mean, honestly.

700
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:45,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you're in prison for something, it shouldn't be happy fun time.

701
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,691
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be pay your penalty time.

702
00:45:48,771 --> 00:45:56,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I'd rather, without getting into a political discussion, I'd rather they take out their sexual frustrations on porno than shower rape.

703
00:45:57,728 --> 00:46:00,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Beat the meat instead of beating each other

704
00:46:27,968 --> 00:46:35,756
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll take place during some show that's going on over there.

705
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:38,559
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ripspeed Donnie Carr Show.

706
00:46:40,123 --> 00:46:43,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's any big thing that's... Did you say car show?

707
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:44,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Car show.

708
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:47,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to get in... It's supposed to... It's Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

709
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on down to the car show and video game tournament.

710
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's going to be happening... Babes in Halo.

711
00:46:52,567 --> 00:47:08,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be happening on the 13th of August, and if you're curious, you can look it up at www.donnyshow.co.uk That's D-O-N-N-Y show.co.uk And they're expecting to get 20,000 visitors.

712
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:16,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's big for a car show or not, but it's going to take place at the North Weld Airfield in Essex.

713
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:31,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you can expect there, though, they're going to be having the Xbox Cup, which is a four-and-a-half-hour live broadcast of the Adidas World of Football in Berlin, which is going to be on Saturday, this Saturday, actually.

714
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:36,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, well, by the time you get this podcast, probably yesterday.

715
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:36,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

716
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:40,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you watched it, or else TiVo'd it.

717
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:47,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, for that one that's actually going on during the car show, they're going to be doing Project Gotham 3 tournament.

718
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they have TiVo in the UK?

719
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:50,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

720
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:52,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they have some type of DVR.

721
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:58,704
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be having a Project Gotham Racing 3 tournament at the car show, which is appropriate since it is a car show.

722
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:05,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And... Yeah, so basically the Extreme Sports Channel has...

723
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:18,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're bringing together hundreds of UK's very best gamers to compete in the UK's first live televised pro racing games tournament.

724
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:30,551
[SPEAKER_04]: After seven days of grueling heats on Xbox Live in the morning at Ripspeed Donny, the final 16 competitors will be pitting their racing skills against the very best the UK has to offer.

725
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:46,097
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be playing Project Gotham Racing 3 on an open-air 20-foot by 15-foot LED screen on live television, and the pressure will be on to give the best performance with a huge audience and a hot list of prizes up for grabs.

726
00:48:46,803 --> 00:48:47,203
[SPEAKER_06]: All three of them?

727
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:48,224
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I said, yeah.

728
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:48,425
[SPEAKER_06]: TV.

729
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:49,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, TiVo's only in the US!

730
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:49,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Not HD.

731
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I don't mean... Forget it.

732
00:49:10,165 --> 00:49:10,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

733
00:49:11,345 --> 00:49:12,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they have that pal thing.

734
00:49:12,886 --> 00:49:13,547
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

735
00:49:13,707 --> 00:49:14,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

736
00:49:14,207 --> 00:49:24,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also going to be rebroadcast, or the four 30-minute live broadcasts are going to be on Sunday, the 13th of August, with the programming repeated between 9 p.m.

737
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:25,653
[SPEAKER_04]: and 11 p.m.

738
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:29,795
[SPEAKER_04]: and midnight to 2 a.m., so... Fun, fun.

739
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:32,556
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, that's kind of neat, though, especially with the Gotham TV.

740
00:49:32,856 --> 00:49:36,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotham TV, if they actually do it right, they can make it look pretty cool, so... I don't know.

741
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:38,379
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

742
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:40,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Saint Seiya's Coming to Europe

743
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:04,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Saint Seiya is a freaking old-ass anime.

744
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why it's taking this long.

745
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:13,154
[SPEAKER_08]: But Atari and Namco Bandai are bringing out Saint Seiya the Hades to Europe later on in the year.

746
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:15,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It's based off the manga and anime.

747
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:20,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Over here it was called Night to the Zodiac or some stupid crap.

748
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:21,959
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they had Saint Seiya over here.

749
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:23,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm?

750
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:24,800
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Saint Seiya over here.

751
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it came out over here as Night to the Zodiac.

752
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,242
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they had it.

753
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:35,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, but basically it's supposed to be full-on anime style.

754
00:50:35,642 --> 00:50:37,382
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the Cosmo system pulled in.

755
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:40,243
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be out in autumn.

756
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:47,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's pretty spiffy there.

757
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:52,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the anime games don't seem to do too well, at least I know from a work standpoint.

758
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:53,345
[SPEAKER_08]: It isn't Dragon Ball anyway.

759
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:55,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always Dragon Ball.

760
00:50:56,006 --> 00:50:56,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Yu-Gi-Oh!

761
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:57,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Yu-Gi-Oh!

762
00:50:57,286 --> 00:50:57,926
[SPEAKER_06]: count as anime?

763
00:50:58,286 --> 00:50:58,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

764
00:50:58,865 --> 00:51:01,627
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a card game than anime, but... Well, Yu-Gi-Oh!

765
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:02,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh!

766
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:03,248
[SPEAKER_06]: What did it start as?

767
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it start as a card game or did it start as anime?

768
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It started as a card game, right?

769
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,652
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it started as the card game.

770
00:51:07,712 --> 00:51:13,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it was another thing before that, like Dual Monsters, and then it was Yu-Gi-Oh!

771
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:15,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually have Yu-Gi-Oh!

772
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:16,579
[SPEAKER_08]: manga from a Shonen Jump from 1991.

773
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:17,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

774
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the brakes on.

775
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:21,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I just realized we're wasting time on this show talking about Yu-Gi-Oh!

776
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:23,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a deck.

777
00:51:24,005 --> 00:51:27,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so as far as stuff coming out this week...

778
00:51:29,472 --> 00:51:29,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

779
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:33,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, absolutely almost nothing.

780
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:36,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Tuesdays are big release days, right?

781
00:51:36,317 --> 00:51:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tuesdays are 4th of July, which is a big holiday here.

782
00:51:38,898 --> 00:51:39,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, not Tuesdays.

783
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:42,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it's around Wednesdays or so, but whatever, it doesn't matter.

784
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:49,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, if you do have a 360, Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 is going to be coming out, so yippee.

785
00:51:51,803 --> 00:51:55,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about the only good game that's coming out this week, to be honest.

786
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:59,668
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like, literally on my pre-book sheet that I was ordering for people, four games.

787
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:00,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

788
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:00,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Four.

789
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:06,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of them were, like there was, was it Board Game Classics 20-1?

790
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:08,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hooray!

791
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:17,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Some soccer game that was on the, Sony's official soccer game on the PSP is coming out.

792
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is funny, because it's still 06, but whatever.

793
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,606
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's coming out, and that's about it.

794
00:52:24,946 --> 00:52:30,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And even the week after that's even... Actually, the week after that's going to be pretty good, because that's when you're going to get Parade and Chromehands and stuff like that.

795
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:37,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, well, we aren't getting crap in the U.S.

796
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:37,694
[SPEAKER_06]: this week.

797
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the U.K.

798
00:52:38,295 --> 00:52:38,935
[SPEAKER_06]: faring any better?

799
00:52:41,497 --> 00:52:48,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, it would be fantastic if that was actually the case, but not always.

800
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:48,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

801
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:55,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll tell you what, there actually are some interesting things going to be out coming up in the first week of July.

802
00:52:56,783 --> 00:53:02,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, honestly, I don't see what's too exciting about Alex Rider's Stormbreaker.

803
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:06,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounded pretty exciting.

804
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:09,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, my cell phone went off in studio.

805
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,652
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also Earache Extreme Metal Racing.

806
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:17,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I have to say, on the 7th, they do get Chromehounds.

807
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:19,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Rider's going to be pretty sweet, though.

808
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:20,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a DS in that.

809
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And they get Electroplankton.

810
00:53:24,821 --> 00:53:27,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow.

811
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:30,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And Super Dragon Ball Z. And that's about it.

812
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:33,166
[SPEAKER_08]: And Big Brain Academy.

813
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:43,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard Big Brain Academy is way better than brain training, but I've only played it myself for like five minutes, so I need more time with it.

814
00:53:43,312 --> 00:53:44,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But it looks like there's a lot more to it.

815
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:45,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Electroplankton.

816
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:52,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing that demo in line at E3 last year like the whole time.

817
00:53:53,312 --> 00:53:54,053
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

818
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:56,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it sounds like a lot of good stuff.

819
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:58,697
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually getting a lot of good games though in July.

820
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:11,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just later on, there's coming out with Civ IV, Civ City Rome, Shin Megami Tensei, which I saw some of at E3 Prey.

821
00:54:12,968 --> 00:54:15,430
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually some pretty decent stuff coming out in July.

822
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:16,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

823
00:54:19,492 --> 00:54:31,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking of stuff coming out, Eevee and GameStop are going to be getting a special edition of Final Fantasy XII, when that finally comes out around Halloween.

824
00:54:32,626 --> 00:54:40,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Included in that, of course, will be a steel bookcase, developers interviews, history of Final Fantasy featurettes,

825
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:49,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XII US trailers, Final Fantasy XII Japanese trailers, Final Fantasy XII art galleries as well.

826
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Cosplay footage, please.

827
00:54:54,045 --> 00:54:54,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.

828
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:59,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get that for $59.99 when that comes out.

829
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:00,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Halloween.

830
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:02,050
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

831
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:05,145
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

832
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:28,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we want to ask is our voicemail question of the week is, do you pre-order games?

833
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:32,066
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, what do you believe are the advantages of pre-ordering games?

834
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,307
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't pre-order games, why don't you do it?

835
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:35,668
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to hear your feedback.

836
00:55:35,688 --> 00:55:37,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll play some of your responses on the air.

837
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:39,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Give our voicemail a call any time during the week.

838
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 916-226-9067.

839
00:55:43,512 --> 00:55:48,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Please keep in mind, boys and girls, that that may be a toll call unless you happen to be local to where we are.

840
00:55:48,654 --> 00:55:52,675
[SPEAKER_06]: So please make sure you have the permission of whoever's paying the phone bill before you give that a call.

841
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:55,156
[SPEAKER_06]: But we want your opinion on pre-ordering games.

842
00:55:55,336 --> 00:56:00,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And are you going to pre-order Final Fantasy XII to get that super special limited edition?

843
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:01,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I might.

844
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:08,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually don't pre-order games, but I might because I'm that big of a XII whore that I might want to have all that special shit.

845
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:09,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

846
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:20,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I mentioned earlier in the program that Major Nelson's blog's been pretty active this week and he wrote a pretty lengthy blog earlier this week about...

847
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:25,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's been bitching and leaving comments in his blog Where's Street Fighter 2?

848
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the demo for Prey?

849
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:41,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see these maintenance shutdowns going on And they even really cock-teased us with Street Fighter 2 Because we have the theme and the gamer pictures But yet no games yet So Major Nelson's getting a lot of heat for this Being the community face there

850
00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:48,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, he's saying blah, blah, blah.

851
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:53,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes developers are not aware of the intense Microsoft certification process.

852
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah.

853
00:56:55,322 --> 00:56:58,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they promise dates and they don't know what the complexity is.

854
00:56:58,605 --> 00:56:59,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah.

855
00:57:00,366 --> 00:57:01,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, guys.

856
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:08,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I understand Major Nelson shouldn't be really taking the blame for this crap, so don't blame him.

857
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:09,615
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time,

858
00:57:10,242 --> 00:57:15,864
[SPEAKER_06]: How many different freaking release dates has Capcom announced for Street Fighter 2 in various ways?

859
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:18,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of their own damn faults.

860
00:57:18,585 --> 00:57:25,347
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't have announced the game was coming out if they weren't done with certification or didn't realize or I don't know what.

861
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:34,631
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't have announced the damn game coming out at all or should have been very vague in it and not get our hopes up time and time again because that's what causes people to get frustrated.

862
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:35,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

863
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:45,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish they'd just release more games, period, on live.

864
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:52,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand they have to go through quality controls and yada yada yada.

865
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:58,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why Street Fighter is being delayed because of the online lag that they have, and they need to really get that fixed, but

866
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:09,290
[SPEAKER_04]: In the same time, I don't understand why they just can't... Like, for example, the thing I'm pissed off and it doesn't really have to do with live too much is how, you know the official Xbox magazine?

867
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they have a disc with it that comes with demos that are on live.

868
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well, it comes with demos.

869
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:19,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of demos are already on live, have been on live for like months.

870
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:24,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So what the hell am I paying for this magazine for demos that I can already download, you know, now?

871
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,520
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

872
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I would say, actually, I'm going to make a bold statement here.

873
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:59,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's part of UNO's huge success right now.

874
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:11,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, it's a solid game and it's a fun thing to play online, but honestly, I think the reason people are still talking about it and people are so into it is that it's all they've really got that's new in the past many months.

875
00:59:11,643 --> 00:59:13,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Because before that, what was the newest game?

876
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:15,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Astro Pop or some crap.

877
00:59:16,307 --> 00:59:18,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really want to play hard with backgammon?

878
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

879
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone play Backgammon anymore?

880
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:23,811
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad might.

881
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:24,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

882
00:59:24,912 --> 00:59:27,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean... If I want to play Backgammon, I'll have a table.

883
00:59:28,453 --> 00:59:29,373
[SPEAKER_08]: An actual board game.

884
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:31,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't get it.

885
00:59:33,174 --> 00:59:37,016
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's their prerogative and how they want to do things.

886
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:44,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho... By the way, DMN in our chatroom would like to point out that he would like to play Hardwood Backgammon.

887
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And is offering to fight you, I believe.

888
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:47,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe he's calling you out.

889
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Backgammon sucks.

890
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:53,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always on the other side of the checkerboard, and I was like, what the hell is this?

891
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to play this.

892
00:59:55,157 --> 01:00:07,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking of stuff that isn't out there, or is not coming out, Australia, Reservoir Dogs the Game, not coming out, because they banned it.

893
01:00:08,603 --> 01:00:09,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they ban it?

894
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:14,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently it was awfully violent, and...

895
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:23,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Players, participants in a bank heist, can literally blow the heads off of hostages and police as well as execute hostages at point-blank range with the gun shot to the head.

896
01:00:36,123 --> 01:00:38,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Use a series of so-called signature torture moves.

897
01:00:38,804 --> 01:00:59,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Players can use different means to torture hostages and thereby cause the police to lay down their weapons, such as repeated pistol whippings to the side of the head with blood spray evident, burning the eyes of a hostage with a cigar until they scream and die, cutting the fingers off of a hostage with blood bursts as the victim screams in pain.

898
01:01:00,611 --> 01:01:07,835
[SPEAKER_04]: In lieu of taking hostages, the players can opt to a more violent scenario where a slow motion shootout occurs, accentuating the violence.

899
01:01:08,576 --> 01:01:09,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I am buying this game.

900
01:01:10,277 --> 01:01:15,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's like Australia just gave free advertising for the game for all the other countries.

901
01:01:15,353 --> 01:01:18,314
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is a little odd that they'd ban it before it's even released.

902
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:20,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't they going after this game?

903
01:01:20,454 --> 01:01:29,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Why isn't... Okay, when this game comes out, the MPA better get off of Hot Coffee's ass for a little bit of sex because this has slicing out fingers and burning out eyes.

904
01:01:29,737 --> 01:01:30,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a little worse.

905
01:01:31,257 --> 01:01:34,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there's no nudity, so... Out of curiosity... What about the movie?

906
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:39,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, out of curiosity, can I still walk into an Australian video store and pick up Reservoir Dogs, the movie?

907
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:40,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can.

908
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:40,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

909
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,720
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an interesting little...

910
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,460
[SPEAKER_08]: It's industry's double standard.

911
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,620
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a double standard.

912
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

913
01:01:49,481 --> 01:01:50,501
[SPEAKER_08]: How stupid.

914
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:53,322
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so stupid.

915
01:01:53,482 --> 01:02:01,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's the player that gets to do it, because the interactiveness makes it worse, I guess?

916
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:03,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the theory behind it?

917
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:04,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.

918
01:02:05,507 --> 01:02:06,267
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

919
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so buying it.

920
01:02:08,123 --> 01:02:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't realize the game was going to be that violent.

921
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:13,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be kind of stupid to not think a Reservoir Dogs game was going to be violent.

922
01:02:13,284 --> 01:02:17,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to be a cheap-ass port, and now I really want to play this game.

923
01:02:17,645 --> 01:02:18,225
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll see.

924
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:22,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, oh, good comment in chat room.

925
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:30,627
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, I can't wait to hear He Who Shall Remain Nameless's reaction to that game when it comes out here.

926
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:31,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Just call him You Know Who.

927
01:02:31,987 --> 01:02:32,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, You Know Who.

928
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:34,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackie Poo.

929
01:02:34,368 --> 01:02:36,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, You Know Who emails us every week.

930
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:39,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, but DarkSakura does because she's our mailbag mistress.

931
01:02:39,735 --> 01:02:57,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you email mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, she puts on her hazmat suit, dives into the email bag, and pulls out her favorite and most, mostly, I was about to say most least favorite, her least favorite emails, her mostest, leastest emails.

932
01:02:57,138 --> 01:02:57,958
[SPEAKER_08]: My mostestly.

933
01:02:59,679 --> 01:02:59,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

934
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:01,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Just read the damn emails, DarkSakura.

935
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, jeez.

936
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,325
[SPEAKER_08]: First email comes from JeremyTodd1.

937
01:03:09,845 --> 01:03:11,466
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, It's JeremyTodd1 again!

938
01:03:11,626 --> 01:03:13,427
[SPEAKER_08]: As if I didn't get that first email.

939
01:03:13,507 --> 01:03:16,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, haven't you read his emails like the past four weeks in a row?

940
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:17,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, fine.

941
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:18,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm skipping it.

942
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:18,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

943
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But he does say House of the Dead.

944
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:24,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And House of the Dead has zombie exploding action.

945
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure everybody gets heard.

946
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,634
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to know what we think about arcade type shooters going on the Wii.

947
01:03:30,194 --> 01:03:30,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Like House of the Dead.

948
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:36,657
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was listening to I want to say All Games.

949
01:03:37,779 --> 01:04:05,614
[SPEAKER_06]: they had some type of rumor about like a lightsaber game being on the Wii and I was thinking like you know the Star Wars trilogy game like in the last stage you could actually fight Darth Vader one on one with a lightsaber and I was thinking I'm not a huge Star Wars fan but that would be one of the most fucking badass things ever to play would be like a lightsaber game first person fighter with the Wii controller that is so freaking hardcore they need a Bluntman and Chronic game where you fight Mark Hamill as the cock knocker

950
01:04:06,946 --> 01:04:07,846
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be fantastic.

951
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:08,586
[SPEAKER_06]: You are so lame.

952
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:09,787
[SPEAKER_06]: But funny, but lame.

953
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:11,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to see Point Blank, please.

954
01:04:12,007 --> 01:04:12,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

955
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:13,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, excuse me.

956
01:04:14,528 --> 01:04:26,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Point Blank, actually, one of our other listeners, Robert M., says, if you're still having trouble finding Point Blank DS, try GameCrazy.

957
01:04:26,951 --> 01:04:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: He says that apparently they've been pretty good to find him there.

958
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:34,674
[SPEAKER_08]: He found his copy and Trauma Center.

959
01:04:34,994 --> 01:04:35,654
[SPEAKER_06]: How about it, Loki?

960
01:04:35,674 --> 01:04:36,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You gonna go?

961
01:04:36,937 --> 01:04:37,937
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a game craze nearby here.

962
01:04:40,198 --> 01:04:46,041
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I thought the one that was in the Hollywood video by me closed down, but I think it's... Go buy Kmart on Sunrise.

963
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care to play that game.

964
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:48,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'll go get it eventually.

965
01:04:49,002 --> 01:04:54,244
[SPEAKER_06]: You bitched about it for two weeks straight on this show that you couldn't find it, and now we're telling you, here it is, go get it.

966
01:04:54,264 --> 01:04:57,485
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, well, I don't know if I want to go get it.

967
01:04:58,006 --> 01:05:01,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I want to go to GameStop because I have credit there, and so I don't want to have to actually pay money.

968
01:05:02,868 --> 01:05:03,188
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

969
01:05:04,328 --> 01:05:05,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, wants to know...

970
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:12,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Regarding the upcoming Transformers movie, what if the official movie poster were one large web sign?

971
01:05:12,563 --> 01:05:18,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it really damn hard to see the... You know when you held your thumb over the Autobot symbol?

972
01:05:18,467 --> 01:05:20,709
[SPEAKER_04]: You heard that the teaser trailer came up today, right?

973
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:24,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I tried to watch it on YouTube and it says, this is unavailable.

974
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:29,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I did see, though, an image from what they thought was going to be Bumblebee.

975
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:33,626
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why he's not a VW Beetle?

976
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:34,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Couldn't get licensing?

977
01:05:35,407 --> 01:05:35,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

978
01:05:35,867 --> 01:05:38,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Jazz isn't going to be a Porsche.

979
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:40,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Blink, blink.

980
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:41,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to be honest.

981
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:45,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember what Transformers was all about, but you name characters and I go whoosh.

982
01:05:46,195 --> 01:05:49,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Jazz was the one whose voice was done by a dude who was Hong Kong phooey.

983
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:52,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Scatman Crothers.

984
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoosh.

985
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well you know Casey Kasem did voices in that too.

986
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:58,310
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do that on television.

987
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

988
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:00,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Gummy Bears.

989
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:01,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Move to Canada.

990
01:06:02,152 --> 01:06:03,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Casey Kasem is a transformer.

991
01:06:05,373 --> 01:06:06,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Casey Kasem?

992
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:08,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the old radio DJ?

993
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:10,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he transforms into stuff.

994
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:10,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's pretty cool.

995
01:06:11,116 --> 01:06:13,478
[SPEAKER_08]: He was Cliffjumper.

996
01:06:14,498 --> 01:06:15,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyway.

997
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:18,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And he also was Shaggy in Scooby-Doo.

998
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:19,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, anyway.

999
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:21,282
[SPEAKER_04]: He was also Casey Kasem.

1000
01:06:21,362 --> 01:06:22,522
[SPEAKER_08]: He was also Casey Kasem.

1001
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

1002
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:24,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Casey Kasem's top 40.

1003
01:06:25,244 --> 01:06:25,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

1004
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:32,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, one from, uh, H Master Osha, says, Happy Birthday, Sky!

1005
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:33,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, thanks.

1006
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:43,028
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my first email to Orange Lounge, but I've been listening since the episode of someone, I think it was a guest, someone like DJ Ranma S, or someone who called in frequently, swore off boners, oh, that was explicit.

1007
01:06:43,148 --> 01:06:45,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, that was explicit, yeah.

1008
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:47,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, swore off boners for Lent.

1009
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:51,992
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, uh, before the podcast and live show merged, cause we didn't, yeah.

1010
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:52,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Old school.

1011
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:55,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, our old live shows used to be nuts.

1012
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:57,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd talk about really crazy stuff.

1013
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,201
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think we're off topic on this show, geez, you should have heard our old live show.

1014
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:01,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

1015
01:07:02,742 --> 01:07:05,523
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably last year's Lent, I think, was when he did that.

1016
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:10,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said that your gift is something found on Google looking for World of Warcraft AMVs.

1017
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:14,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you find it as funny as I did, but there's not a link to it.

1018
01:07:14,908 --> 01:07:17,669
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all doing a great job, even with an anti-Mac co-host.

1019
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:21,050
[SPEAKER_08]: And before I forget, he actually gave me what I'm using as my side of the week.

1020
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:21,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, awesome.

1021
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:22,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1022
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:24,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for the birthday wishes.

1023
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:27,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't gotten a chance to watch the video yet because I think my Outlook didn't like the attachment.

1024
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:31,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe email it to me.

1025
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:33,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Send it to me as a web link or something and I'll try to get it.

1026
01:07:34,213 --> 01:07:37,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Send it to me on YouSendIt or one of those sites.

1027
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,675
[SPEAKER_06]: That's usually the best way.

1028
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:39,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see the attachment.

1029
01:07:39,816 --> 01:07:42,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Outlook doesn't like attachments from people for some reason.

1030
01:07:42,177 --> 01:07:44,658
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I don't use Outlook to check our mail.

1031
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:47,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I use the web mail because I can check it from work.

1032
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:47,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, stop it.

1033
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up is a

1034
01:07:52,864 --> 01:07:54,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Carlos, emailing us.

1035
01:07:56,065 --> 01:07:59,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And it says, hey guys, congrats on four years.

1036
01:07:59,546 --> 01:08:00,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1037
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:00,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1038
01:08:00,847 --> 01:08:05,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been enjoying this podcast since August something and it's still made of win and awesome.

1039
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:06,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, that's sweet.

1040
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:06,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1041
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:09,690
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where our cake was made of too, win and awesome.

1042
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:16,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, I went to my local GameStop to pick up Mega Man EX E6 poster they kept for me because I'm a family.

1043
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:22,738
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I was talking to the manager, we're friends, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Nintendo DS package with something in it.

1044
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,578
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like a GBA cartridge.

1045
01:08:24,678 --> 01:08:29,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I inquired about this and found out it was a rumble pack for Super Princess Peach, Metroid Pinball, and two other games.

1046
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this didn't surprise me, and I thought gimmicks gimmicks until I saw the price tag, $99.99.

1047
01:08:35,162 --> 01:08:38,603
[SPEAKER_08]: In closing, I'd just like to say, what the fuck, Nintendo?

1048
01:08:41,581 --> 01:08:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the Rumble fact's $99.99.

1049
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:45,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's $9.99 or something like that.

1050
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:49,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was just a mistype or something.

1051
01:08:49,026 --> 01:08:49,667
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way that's $100.

1052
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:52,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think maybe it was just a little oopsie.

1053
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of oopsies, there's still more email.

1054
01:08:57,272 --> 01:08:57,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

1055
01:08:57,892 --> 01:09:01,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually really going through the email because I got quite a bit in just a few days.

1056
01:09:01,575 --> 01:09:01,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1057
01:09:01,915 --> 01:09:02,956
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taping early this week, too.

1058
01:09:03,296 --> 01:09:04,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, listeners.

1059
01:09:05,384 --> 01:09:06,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Drown her in that email.

1060
01:09:06,865 --> 01:09:07,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1061
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:08,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dude.

1062
01:09:08,466 --> 01:09:09,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry if I blew out somebody's speakers.

1063
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:10,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one.

1064
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:12,209
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a name.

1065
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:15,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually Trace said, Hey, guys.

1066
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:15,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice.

1067
01:09:15,971 --> 01:09:18,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering if any of you have played the game Bumpies.

1068
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:23,917
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a DOS game, and I think there would be a remake for the PSP like they did with Lemmings.

1069
01:09:24,617 --> 01:09:25,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of that.

1070
01:09:25,498 --> 01:09:26,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Never heard of it.

1071
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:26,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1072
01:09:27,139 --> 01:09:28,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us more info or a link or something.

1073
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll check it out.

1074
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:29,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1075
01:09:30,421 --> 01:09:31,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if it's free.

1076
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:31,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Free rocks.

1077
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get an email that at first sort of pissed me off.

1078
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:39,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to be, I'm not trying to be TMI about anything.

1079
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:48,997
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know when I said, made the comment that, yeah, if I ever saw any of my kids reenacting something from a violent video game, I'd pop them one.

1080
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:49,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1081
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:54,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it wasn't necessarily that I would treat violence with violence because we got an email from one of our listeners.

1082
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,261
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't mean you were going to pop the kid with a baseball bat, right?

1083
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:57,581
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1084
01:09:58,162 --> 01:09:58,922
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I used my hand.

1085
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this is what I think about.

1086
01:10:02,037 --> 01:10:03,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And you hit like a girl.

1087
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:04,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just teasing.

1088
01:10:04,938 --> 01:10:05,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get hit.

1089
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,438
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get hit like a girl.

1090
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:08,599
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1091
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:19,102
[SPEAKER_08]: But seriously, and I'm not going to go into any detail because it's nobody's business, but I do firsthand know the difference between abuse and punishment.

1092
01:10:19,922 --> 01:10:25,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that I very well know where the limits, the line would be drawn.

1093
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:27,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that

1094
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:38,057
[SPEAKER_08]: The video game shouldn't be as much as the concern as the home environment that one is raised in as far as what determines if someone's going to turn out a violent person or not.

1095
01:10:38,677 --> 01:10:42,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that if me just going, oh, well, don't do that.

1096
01:10:42,358 --> 01:10:43,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, don't do that.

1097
01:10:43,299 --> 01:10:43,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, don't do that.

1098
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:44,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Stand in the corner.

1099
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:51,481
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's not going to do the job, I'm not beyond, you know, doing a little physical discipline.

1100
01:10:52,241 --> 01:10:54,462
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was spanked as a kid.

1101
01:10:54,582 --> 01:10:56,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had much worse.

1102
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,063
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when you...

1103
01:10:58,615 --> 01:10:59,495
[SPEAKER_08]: You've learned the difference.

1104
01:11:00,035 --> 01:11:00,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this an email?

1105
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was an email.

1106
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:05,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this why I'm not going into any detail on the email?

1107
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:10,099
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'd just like to clarify that, that that's my feelings toward it.

1108
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:19,942
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's going to save my child growing up to be some sort of serial killer,

1109
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:27,961
[SPEAKER_08]: or knowing that it's not right to go and kick somebody because they pissed you off, then I'm not beyond it.

1110
01:11:30,322 --> 01:11:38,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me try to spin it this way, because I like to be the one that likes to make the happy, politically correct, make everybody happy statement, so try to humor me on this one.

1111
01:11:39,352 --> 01:11:43,354
[SPEAKER_06]: There are certain choices that you get to make as a parent in the way you want to raise your kid.

1112
01:11:43,574 --> 01:11:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, there's many choices that you get to make, as long, you know, obviously you don't break the law, but, you know, there's choices that you get to make.

1113
01:11:50,497 --> 01:12:00,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of those choices is what we're talking about here, but another one that relates to the bigger topic at hand is, you know, do you want your child exposed to violent video games?

1114
01:12:00,882 --> 01:12:02,363
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you believe is right for your child?

1115
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:02,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And so on.

1116
01:12:03,413 --> 01:12:05,255
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly my point.

1117
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:13,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that if they're four years old, yeah, sitting them down with dead rights isn't necessarily a good idea.

1118
01:12:13,984 --> 01:12:17,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if they're like 13, that's not so much of a deal.

1119
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:20,830
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not just the games.

1120
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,672
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to look at it environmentally.

1121
01:12:22,692 --> 01:12:26,476
[SPEAKER_08]: How many children are raised with violence in their homes every day and don't own a video game system?

1122
01:12:27,437 --> 01:12:27,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1123
01:12:28,154 --> 01:12:29,015
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my point on that.

1124
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:34,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I think it starts with how parents choose to discipline their children and what they allow them to be exposed to.

1125
01:12:35,339 --> 01:12:36,119
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my point.

1126
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:37,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that it?

1127
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:38,101
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1128
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:38,921
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1129
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:40,682
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more.

1130
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:41,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more.

1131
01:12:41,603 --> 01:12:42,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wow.

1132
01:12:42,123 --> 01:12:43,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, got a lot of emails.

1133
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:44,085
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1134
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:46,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we may have to have a two-part show tonight.

1135
01:12:46,286 --> 01:12:46,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1136
01:12:46,846 --> 01:12:50,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Crispy Creamy wants to know if you have to have an Xbox 360 to be part of the OLR army.

1137
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:52,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, what are the requirements?

1138
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:55,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, I said starting up the whole...

1139
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:57,434
[SPEAKER_06]: One minor bitch correction.

1140
01:12:58,034 --> 01:13:04,680
[SPEAKER_06]: When it was coined, the phrase, it's actually O-L-R, uppercase, M-Y, lowercase, O-L-R-M-E.

1141
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

1142
01:13:06,461 --> 01:13:07,362
[SPEAKER_08]: You can thank me for that.

1143
01:13:07,662 --> 01:13:12,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we ever specifically said how we wanted to do the O-L-R-M-E.

1144
01:13:12,546 --> 01:13:15,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So the jury's out on that.

1145
01:13:16,049 --> 01:13:20,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we want to have gaming cliques all over, not just 360, but other games too.

1146
01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:22,114
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a Super Nintendo...

1147
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:25,869
[SPEAKER_08]: We want our Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition.

1148
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:26,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Killer Instinct.

1149
01:13:27,311 --> 01:13:28,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Killer Instinct.

1150
01:13:28,472 --> 01:13:30,494
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be one branch of the OL Army, absolutely.

1151
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:33,817
[SPEAKER_06]: More to come on the OL Army when we have some ideas.

1152
01:13:33,837 --> 01:13:42,485
[SPEAKER_08]: But for any folks that are on MMOs, plug, plug, plug, I have a site, roleplay.darksakura.com, where I'm hosting MMO chats.

1153
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:44,887
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, Death Cakes still hosted there to this day.

1154
01:13:45,027 --> 01:13:46,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my old Final Fantasy XI link show.

1155
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:47,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though none of us are there.

1156
01:13:48,183 --> 01:13:51,664
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they've been going pretty strong on there.

1157
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:56,945
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if we get a big enough group, you know, I pick the people who are the most responsible to make moderators on the board.

1158
01:13:57,005 --> 01:14:04,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, temporary hosting at least for the MMOs and even tabletop gamers will be up on roleplay.darksakura.com.

1159
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:05,387
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, the hardcore nerds.

1160
01:14:05,727 --> 01:14:06,327
[SPEAKER_08]: The hardcore nerds.

1161
01:14:06,367 --> 01:14:07,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I do tabletop gaming.

1162
01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:09,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're also a hardcore nerd.

1163
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:10,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.

1164
01:14:10,548 --> 01:14:11,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Nerd pride, yo.

1165
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:14,369
[SPEAKER_08]: The last one is the biggest email ever.

1166
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:16,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1167
01:14:16,429 --> 01:14:16,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Really.

1168
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:18,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a multi-paragraph email.

1169
01:14:18,862 --> 01:14:19,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1170
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:23,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was sent by Joey.

1171
01:14:24,185 --> 01:14:24,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1172
01:14:25,146 --> 01:14:26,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Orange Lounge Royalty.

1173
01:14:28,248 --> 01:14:29,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I like this guy already.

1174
01:14:29,288 --> 01:14:29,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1175
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:30,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Second time writing.

1176
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:33,591
[SPEAKER_08]: First time was on MySpace asking for Genesis titles.

1177
01:14:34,592 --> 01:14:38,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd first like to thank you in the chatroom for giving some great recommendations to pimp out my Genesis 3.

1178
01:14:40,235 --> 01:14:41,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Our chatroom's getting love.

1179
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:42,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1180
01:14:42,597 --> 01:14:42,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1181
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:43,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1182
01:14:43,866 --> 01:14:45,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to join an Orange Lounge clan.

1183
01:14:46,008 --> 01:14:48,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't call it the OC or something stupid.

1184
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:49,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Army sounds good.

1185
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:52,453
[SPEAKER_06]: We would never relate this program to that.

1186
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:53,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1187
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a little credit, dude.

1188
01:14:55,476 --> 01:14:56,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Army sounds good.

1189
01:14:56,537 --> 01:14:57,738
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually OL Army, but we just said that.

1190
01:14:57,758 --> 01:14:58,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's fine.

1191
01:14:58,519 --> 01:15:00,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Though I'm getting rid of a couple of my Xbox 360 games.

1192
01:15:02,322 --> 01:15:05,505
[SPEAKER_08]: What's... GR, AW, and Burnout Revenge.

1193
01:15:06,045 --> 01:15:06,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1194
01:15:06,786 --> 01:15:08,847
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason I am getting rid of...

1195
01:15:10,313 --> 01:15:13,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm trying to think of what GR, because my brain... Ghost Recon.

1196
01:15:13,154 --> 01:15:14,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghost Recon, okay.

1197
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:15,534
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I don't play that.

1198
01:15:15,694 --> 01:15:16,014
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1199
01:15:16,394 --> 01:15:22,916
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because of Chapter 2, basically the way I feel about the upgrade packs is that they are a buy them or have fun finding a game online anymore.

1200
01:15:23,896 --> 01:15:26,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no problem with paying for more stuff but not $15.

1201
01:15:27,117 --> 01:15:31,038
[SPEAKER_08]: If I bought Chapter 2, I would have spent a total of approximately $80 considering taxes.

1202
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:41,425
[SPEAKER_08]: The Gross Recon was fun, but hardly worth $65 taxes again, and not worth $80 to me, so I'm going to get $35 available towards something else.

1203
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:45,827
[SPEAKER_08]: With Burnout, I'm simply just burned out from playing an HD Xbox clone.

1204
01:15:47,324 --> 01:15:50,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked up all the prices for stuff and I should have around $120.

1205
01:15:50,348 --> 01:16:02,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a little battle of conscience of whether or not to put it to my inevitable purchase of a Nintendo Wii, bless you, or spend the money on some of the, I guess, delish looking Xbox 360 titles and accessories.

1206
01:16:02,902 --> 01:16:07,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like input, but I don't expect it because people are really cautious of saying anything these days.

1207
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:16,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Going forward, leaning towards the Wii because I already have Zelda Twilight Princess for GameCube reserved.

1208
01:16:16,559 --> 01:16:17,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I will switch it to Wii most likely.

1209
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:25,692
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, either way, you're going to be saving that money because if you were listening to the release date segment, there's really not a lot out there right now.

1210
01:16:25,732 --> 01:16:29,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, it sounds like you've kind of torn through a lot of the big Xbox 360 titles.

1211
01:16:29,814 --> 01:16:30,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I like Burnout.

1212
01:16:30,874 --> 01:16:31,695
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun for a while.

1213
01:16:31,715 --> 01:16:32,755
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still fun for me right now.

1214
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:37,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like you've got most of the good stuff already taken care of.

1215
01:16:37,697 --> 01:16:40,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, there's really not a lot out.

1216
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:45,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want good Xbox 360 titles, one I'm pretty excited about that looks pretty hot to me is 99 Nights.

1217
01:16:46,479 --> 01:17:15,682
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's not coming out until August so you'd have to be saving your money for that so I think either way you're going to end up saving your money so whether you decide to put it towards a Wii or whatever you know maybe wait and see when we get a little more information on the Wii or what have you you'll notice that my gaming week personally has slowed down a little bit and I've been talking about the same games each week because there hasn't been a lot of new stuff that's been that exciting I think most of us are kind of like we're catching up on old stuff or something so it's kind of a slow period for games right now and I think you'll end up just saving your money for the fall

1218
01:17:17,055 --> 01:17:18,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Play Animal Crossing with us.

1219
01:17:41,081 --> 01:17:42,782
[SPEAKER_08]: and then they look at the talent.

1220
01:17:43,563 --> 01:17:46,105
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they had them running around the E3 doing interviews.

1221
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:48,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in no way saying that there isn't talent in those clans.

1222
01:17:49,888 --> 01:17:51,009
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really decent clans.

1223
01:17:51,029 --> 01:17:54,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying that because you have to have both looks and talent to be in them.

1224
01:17:54,752 --> 01:18:00,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So saying that the beauty contest and whatnot is unfair because you don't actually have to be a hardcore gamer is kind of stupid.

1225
01:18:01,017 --> 01:18:05,340
[SPEAKER_08]: That just makes it like every other modeling show that has ever existed that they have never boycotted.

1226
01:18:06,124 --> 01:18:09,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they actually do have the Mr. Video Game Beauty contest.

1227
01:18:09,567 --> 01:18:16,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Average men would take competitions like these a lot more lighthearted than the ladies, and it would actually be fun and maybe even funny in a lighthearted sense.

1228
01:18:16,532 --> 01:18:18,574
[SPEAKER_08]: This just applies to this type of contest, though.

1229
01:18:18,654 --> 01:18:19,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Sports for men is a different story.

1230
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:24,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And he also wants to know what the song we used for my Website of the Week segment.

1231
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Candy from DDR Ohasta, which is a Japanese import-only game.

1232
01:18:30,463 --> 01:18:30,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1233
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:31,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck finding that.

1234
01:18:31,744 --> 01:18:32,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1235
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:34,869
[SPEAKER_08]: There are nefarious ways.

1236
01:18:35,029 --> 01:18:36,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Well done emails this week.

1237
01:18:36,829 --> 01:18:39,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I applaud the listeners.

1238
01:18:39,731 --> 01:18:40,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep it moving.

1239
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:44,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, speaking of fun stuff.

1240
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Take-Two has been subpoenaed over the hot coffee.

1241
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:49,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1242
01:18:49,554 --> 01:18:53,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Just when you think your tax dollars are going to something good, they're not.

1243
01:18:54,150 --> 01:19:22,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, basically, Take-Two has received grand jury subpoenas, and this is being issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York, requesting the production of documents covering various periods beginning on October 1st, 2001, including those relating to the hot coffee issue and the creation, inclusion, and programming of hidden scenes.

1244
01:19:23,856 --> 01:19:35,710
[SPEAKER_04]: and also it should be noted that some people might be able to face jail time which I think is funny because the whole system is a voluntary system so how the hell are they going to go to jail over that?

1245
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:41,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's time for everybody to get past it already.

1246
01:19:41,202 --> 01:19:43,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just so sick of hearing about it.

1247
01:19:43,104 --> 01:19:50,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about the new... Listen, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, that's a couple years ago.

1248
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:51,374
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1249
01:19:51,775 --> 01:19:54,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about the Reservoir Dogs game.

1250
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:56,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very interested to see what happens with Grand Theft Auto 4.

1251
01:19:57,614 --> 01:19:58,054
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1252
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,921
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nintendo DS is looking to one-up the competition, even though they don't exactly need it.

1253
01:20:24,941 --> 01:20:26,582
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing pretty well on the market right now.

1254
01:20:26,642 --> 01:20:31,203
[SPEAKER_06]: However, you may have heard that there is a new Opera browser coming out for the DS.

1255
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:32,143
[SPEAKER_06]: In Japan.

1256
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,443
[SPEAKER_06]: In Japan, yes.

1257
01:20:33,603 --> 01:20:35,844
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's coming out just in, like, what, less than a month?

1258
01:20:36,284 --> 01:20:36,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty nice.

1259
01:20:37,785 --> 01:20:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a Japanese website.

1260
01:20:40,017 --> 01:20:43,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo Japan has a website that talks all about the new browser.

1261
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:53,684
[SPEAKER_06]: The browser will support stylus-based controls for scrolling, going between pages, inputting characters with handwriting or a keyboard on there.

1262
01:20:54,164 --> 01:21:01,788
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the bad news is the browser won't be able to display Flash, won't be able to do PDFs, and it's not going to do video or sound.

1263
01:21:02,188 --> 01:21:04,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So no YouTubing on your Nintendo DS.

1264
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:05,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, kids.

1265
01:21:07,289 --> 01:21:07,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a start.

1266
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:14,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it supports good JavaScript, because then you can still do like, you know, I know they already have Homebrew for it.

1267
01:21:14,692 --> 01:21:16,973
[SPEAKER_06]: The first PSP browser didn't support a lot of that either.

1268
01:21:17,514 --> 01:21:19,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the PDFs still aren't supported on there.

1269
01:21:19,814 --> 01:21:20,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1270
01:21:20,975 --> 01:21:25,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, whatever, but still though, I mean... It's better than nothing.

1271
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:29,959
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be able to program a chatroom out of that, or an MRC client.

1272
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:34,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're going to have to do OLRDS.com.

1273
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound like a project you want to do, Loki?

1274
01:21:36,707 --> 01:21:41,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless them for sticking with us when we've been pretty harsh on Sony.

1275
01:21:41,489 --> 01:21:43,749
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been giving them a good lashing on this show.

1276
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:46,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless you guys for sticking with us and realizing that we're just trying to

1277
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:07,587
[SPEAKER_06]: See the big picture here.

1278
01:22:07,647 --> 01:22:08,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Sony stuff.

1279
01:22:08,447 --> 01:22:09,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two PSPs myself.

1280
01:22:10,128 --> 01:22:11,708
[SPEAKER_04]: And then PlayStation.

1281
01:22:11,788 --> 01:22:13,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have like three PlayStations.

1282
01:22:13,868 --> 01:22:15,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I like my PlayStation 2.

1283
01:22:15,109 --> 01:22:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2.

1284
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:16,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And my PlayStation 1.

1285
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,089
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got two PlayStation 2.

1286
01:22:18,169 --> 01:22:20,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a stack of three old school PlayStations.

1287
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:29,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan and I tore up a KB Toys trying to find one of the last ones that had the IO port in the back before they put out the New Deal shocks.

1288
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:32,172
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, enough Sony penis talk.

1289
01:22:32,232 --> 01:22:32,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's...

1290
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:36,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about what other sites you can browse on your Nintendo DS.

1291
01:22:37,013 --> 01:22:40,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you will want to visit first DarkSakura's website of the week.

1292
01:22:41,214 --> 01:22:43,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, what website should the kids be looking at this week?

1293
01:22:45,616 --> 01:22:50,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this site was sent to me by one of the lovely listeners whose email I read.

1294
01:22:50,677 --> 01:22:53,118
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kawainot.com.

1295
01:22:53,938 --> 01:22:57,439
[SPEAKER_08]: K-A-W-A-I-N-O-T dot com.

1296
01:22:58,288 --> 01:23:01,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Kawaii, for those who don't know any Japanese at all, means cute.

1297
01:23:02,171 --> 01:23:03,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's cutenot.com.

1298
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:05,453
[SPEAKER_08]: This site is messed up.

1299
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:08,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it's called The Comic for Cute Gone Bad.

1300
01:23:09,056 --> 01:23:15,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to describe some of this, it's all really adorable, really cutesy stuff.

1301
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:17,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the page I'm on right now has a necktie.

1302
01:23:18,263 --> 01:23:19,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's smiling.

1303
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:22,266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a four-panel, you know, vertical comic.

1304
01:23:22,866 --> 01:23:23,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And it keeps going down.

1305
01:23:23,787 --> 01:23:26,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the very last thing has the caption, I'm slowly strangling you.

1306
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:31,344
[SPEAKER_08]: But my favorite one on here is actually the very, very first one.

1307
01:23:31,944 --> 01:23:34,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It has two little puffballs meeting up.

1308
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,286
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one goes, I'm a cloud.

1309
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:38,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And then nothing in the second panel.

1310
01:23:39,268 --> 01:23:41,569
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the third panel, it says, I'm a fart.

1311
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last panel is the cloud one going, ah.

1312
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:47,312
[SPEAKER_08]: This sight.

1313
01:23:48,073 --> 01:23:51,274
[SPEAKER_08]: It really follows some of the potty humor, but it's just so, huh?

1314
01:23:51,755 --> 01:23:53,315
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it earns Website of the Week.

1315
01:23:55,517 --> 01:23:56,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Great suggestions.

1316
01:23:57,071 --> 01:23:58,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I love potty humor, so good choice.

1317
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:00,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to link this particular one in the chat room.

1318
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:00,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1319
01:24:01,874 --> 01:24:02,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

1320
01:24:03,995 --> 01:24:04,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1321
01:24:04,855 --> 01:24:05,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Go potty humor.

1322
01:24:06,756 --> 01:24:09,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you won't find potty humor, 99 Nights.

1323
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:14,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of 99 Nights, you don't need a hard drive to play the game.

1324
01:24:15,641 --> 01:24:20,023
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a boo-boo on the website staff at Xbox.com.

1325
01:24:20,483 --> 01:24:20,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Fired!

1326
01:24:21,284 --> 01:24:22,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody's getting fired!

1327
01:24:23,265 --> 01:24:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually...

1328
01:24:25,214 --> 01:24:27,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just saying that they support a hard drive for game saves.

1329
01:24:28,477 --> 01:24:30,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a memory unit.

1330
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:32,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, as long as you have that, good.

1331
01:24:33,042 --> 01:24:36,585
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is optimized for the hard drive, so that's good to know.

1332
01:24:36,665 --> 01:24:41,950
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't need it, so go out and buy the game when it comes out in August.

1333
01:24:42,591 --> 01:24:49,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, this may be a little bit of potty humor, I don't know, but everybody's been wanting to check out what's under the Wii's flap.

1334
01:24:50,896 --> 01:24:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: You know there's that little flap on the Wii and everybody wants to peek under the flap and see what's there?

1335
01:24:54,637 --> 01:24:55,537
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so hot!

1336
01:24:55,757 --> 01:25:00,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, here's what's the latest internet rumor.

1337
01:25:00,098 --> 01:25:01,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, not so much a rumor.

1338
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:02,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this has been confirmed now.

1339
01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:03,819
[SPEAKER_06]: What is underneath that damn Wii flap?

1340
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,061
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a tip on GoNintendo.

1341
01:25:08,381 --> 01:25:16,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Working at the Nintendo booth this year at E3 after close on the last day, everyone was involved in the tearing down and boxing up of everything that was to be sent back to corporate.

1342
01:25:17,299 --> 01:25:17,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1343
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's what it is.

1344
01:25:34,761 --> 01:25:42,966
[SPEAKER_06]: The memory card slot is there as well as the... I thought I read somewhere that Reggie had confirmed that the GameCube stuff was there too.

1345
01:25:43,246 --> 01:25:44,247
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the GameCube is on top.

1346
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:45,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1347
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Or side, however you have that.

1348
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:50,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be in, I guess, the picture where you're looking at the front.

1349
01:25:50,751 --> 01:25:51,411
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be on top.

1350
01:25:51,852 --> 01:25:52,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, gotcha.

1351
01:25:52,732 --> 01:25:53,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And this...

1352
01:25:54,053 --> 01:25:57,977
[SPEAKER_04]: The memory card slot, he said that was what, that was, you know, under there as well.

1353
01:25:58,317 --> 01:26:00,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were just, you know, expecting there was another button under there.

1354
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sync... OMG, another button!

1355
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:08,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, sync button, which, you know, no, it's not to sync up to your Nintendo DS.

1356
01:26:08,686 --> 01:26:13,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to, you know, sync up to your wireless controllers, just like the Xbox 360 has, so...

1357
01:26:14,983 --> 01:26:17,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know there was a sync button on the Xbox 360.

1358
01:26:17,424 --> 01:26:17,904
[SPEAKER_06]: How'd you set up?

1359
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:18,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, you have wired controllers.

1360
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:19,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, I have wired controllers.

1361
01:26:19,905 --> 01:26:20,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1362
01:26:20,246 --> 01:26:20,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

1363
01:26:20,626 --> 01:26:26,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you don't need a sync of... Well, when you get wireless controllers one of these days... I don't want wireless controllers.

1364
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Wireless controllers will get lost.

1365
01:26:27,569 --> 01:26:28,409
[SPEAKER_06]: The couch will eat them.

1366
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind wired controllers.

1367
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't.

1368
01:26:31,591 --> 01:26:32,191
[SPEAKER_06]: They're USB.

1369
01:26:32,231 --> 01:26:33,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I can use them on the computer.

1370
01:26:33,692 --> 01:26:37,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that's what it is for, so... All right, fine.

1371
01:26:37,374 --> 01:26:37,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1372
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:44,337
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um... You know, I'm sure that they've got some more secrets, you know...

1373
01:26:46,176 --> 01:26:48,717
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just have to wait and see.

1374
01:26:48,757 --> 01:26:54,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of stuff that has been out before, Castlevania.

1375
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:59,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's getting made into a movie by Paul W.S.

1376
01:26:59,562 --> 01:26:59,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Anderson.

1377
01:27:01,042 --> 01:27:02,043
[SPEAKER_04]: He did Mortal Kombat, didn't he?

1378
01:27:02,643 --> 01:27:03,603
[SPEAKER_04]: He did Resident Evil.

1379
01:27:04,524 --> 01:27:05,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't he also do Mortal Kombat?

1380
01:27:07,905 --> 01:27:11,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania, he's not going to shoot until he's done with the Death Race 3000 remix.

1381
01:27:13,759 --> 01:27:14,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Death Race 3000 Remake

1382
01:27:35,563 --> 01:27:39,384
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's lots of unnecessary nudity and violence.

1383
01:27:39,824 --> 01:27:43,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically a movie that would have inspired Carmageddon.

1384
01:27:44,245 --> 01:27:45,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So just take it as that.

1385
01:27:46,685 --> 01:27:51,026
[SPEAKER_04]: They roll out old grannies into the street and they run through them with you and kill people.

1386
01:27:51,626 --> 01:27:52,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's Death Race.

1387
01:27:53,766 --> 01:27:54,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Must watch the DVD.

1388
01:27:54,826 --> 01:27:55,547
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on PSP too.

1389
01:27:56,107 --> 01:27:57,887
[SPEAKER_04]: This has what to do with Castlevania?

1390
01:27:58,407 --> 01:27:59,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I just like Death Race.

1391
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's going to make the game and he says it's going to basically be a

1392
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:15,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you'd say a reinterpretation, but it's basically going to cover the origins of the Belmont family and Dracula and all that fun stuff.

1393
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:20,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's also going to do DOA, the horrible, horrible movie.

1394
01:28:21,012 --> 01:28:21,992
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't do that movie, did he?

1395
01:28:23,433 --> 01:28:23,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1396
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:24,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Anderson did?

1397
01:28:24,993 --> 01:28:25,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently.

1398
01:28:25,853 --> 01:28:26,133
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1399
01:28:26,153 --> 01:28:26,913
[SPEAKER_08]: That movie frightens me.

1400
01:28:26,993 --> 01:28:28,274
[SPEAKER_06]: No, somebody else did that movie, didn't he?

1401
01:28:28,494 --> 01:28:31,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking on IMDB right now.

1402
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:33,215
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell us the updates, I'll tell you.

1403
01:28:33,235 --> 01:28:34,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy Bolt, I'm sorry.

1404
01:28:34,335 --> 01:28:34,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1405
01:28:36,069 --> 01:28:36,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1406
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:40,051
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, yeah, I don't know.

1407
01:28:40,251 --> 01:28:42,232
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

1408
01:28:43,973 --> 01:28:44,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1409
01:28:45,014 --> 01:28:45,594
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the updates?

1410
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:46,655
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new on Dinner Live?

1411
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:47,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's coming out.

1412
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:52,838
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to make a sequel to it also.

1413
01:28:53,138 --> 01:28:54,219
Oh, God.

1414
01:28:55,299 --> 01:28:56,380
[SPEAKER_06]: But the movie hasn't even come out yet.

1415
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,100
[SPEAKER_06]: What if it flops?

1416
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:57,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

1417
01:28:58,661 --> 01:29:02,223
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm most happy about Resident Evil movie because I actually did like Resident Evil Apocalypse.

1418
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:03,257
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't see it.

1419
01:29:03,877 --> 01:29:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it says basically Bolt confirms that... Or Bolt's head.

1420
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Bolt might be the company.

1421
01:29:13,861 --> 01:29:14,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1422
01:29:14,381 --> 01:29:14,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stupid.

1423
01:29:15,341 --> 01:29:15,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy Bolt.

1424
01:29:16,221 --> 01:29:16,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1425
01:29:16,982 --> 01:29:17,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the lion?

1426
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:18,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

1427
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:21,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out with a sequel to this movie that's crap.

1428
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, wait a minute.

1429
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:24,404
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Charlie's Angels 2.

1430
01:29:24,504 --> 01:29:26,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, you haven't seen the movie yet.

1431
01:29:26,605 --> 01:29:27,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Crap.

1432
01:29:27,325 --> 01:29:27,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it.

1433
01:29:27,805 --> 01:29:28,886
[SPEAKER_06]: The trailer did suck.

1434
01:29:29,086 --> 01:29:29,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you that.

1435
01:29:32,142 --> 01:29:34,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to answer this question because Loki can't freaking do his research.

1436
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:35,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

1437
01:29:36,243 --> 01:29:37,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Directed by Corey Ewan.

1438
01:29:39,284 --> 01:29:40,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that say Anderson to you?

1439
01:29:40,825 --> 01:29:41,405
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Corey.

1440
01:29:41,425 --> 01:29:41,725
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1441
01:29:42,065 --> 01:29:42,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, Loki.

1442
01:29:43,606 --> 01:29:44,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

1443
01:29:44,066 --> 01:29:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooked on phonics.

1444
01:29:44,806 --> 01:29:45,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Worked for Loki.

1445
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

1446
01:29:48,114 --> 01:29:49,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead or Alive should star only porn stars.

1447
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:17,935
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also, you can call us, 916-226-9067.

1448
01:30:18,295 --> 01:30:22,199
[SPEAKER_06]: However, please have mommy or daddy's permission if you're not the one paying the phone bill.

1449
01:30:22,819 --> 01:30:26,563
[SPEAKER_06]: While we wait for a phone call, I'd like to ask if there's any last minute stories.

1450
01:30:28,124 --> 01:30:30,246
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a story on the internet about how awesome I am.

1451
01:30:32,047 --> 01:30:32,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure there is.

1452
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:34,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Also about how modest and... Oh, look, we have a call.

1453
01:30:35,723 --> 01:30:36,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1454
01:30:36,943 --> 01:30:37,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1455
01:30:38,104 --> 01:30:46,707
[SPEAKER_03]: This is DMN, and Loki, I think the idea of putting porn stars in a Dead or Alive movie has to have been the worst idea I've ever heard come out of your mouth.

1456
01:30:46,987 --> 01:30:47,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, why?

1457
01:30:48,807 --> 01:30:53,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want porn stars fucking up my fighting game.

1458
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Your fighting game's already fucked up.

1459
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:56,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the trailer?

1460
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:59,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I stopped playing after three.

1461
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:01,561
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't want to get a 360.

1462
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:03,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

1463
01:31:03,683 --> 01:31:09,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you're the ultra-est of Nintendo fanboys, though.

1464
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,831
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not true.

1465
01:31:11,891 --> 01:31:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I work at Nintendo does not mean I'm a Nintendo fanboy.

1466
01:31:15,734 --> 01:31:20,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the next Gen Wars, which console are you going to buy?

1467
01:31:21,019 --> 01:31:24,182
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'm buying a Wii just because I conveniently work at Nintendo.

1468
01:31:24,262 --> 01:31:25,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but is there going to be a second?

1469
01:31:26,764 --> 01:31:31,929
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody puts a gun to my head, I will probably break down and buy a 360.

1470
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,030
[SPEAKER_06]: No love for PS3?

1471
01:31:35,091 --> 01:31:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I had a little light for him, but after what I was reading about Kazurai being the pot calling the kettle black, that's not happening anymore.

1472
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:50,184
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you want to call in about tonight, besides berating Loki, which I appreciate?

1473
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:51,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen the week.

1474
01:31:55,419 --> 01:31:56,679
[SPEAKER_03]: You have seen Wii.

1475
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:00,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen Wii, and I have not seen it in my department, so I can talk about it.

1476
01:32:01,741 --> 01:32:03,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1477
01:32:03,361 --> 01:32:06,862
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing a little retail tech demo of it at corporate.

1478
01:32:07,002 --> 01:32:07,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked pretty cool.

1479
01:32:09,563 --> 01:32:10,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to test it.

1480
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:13,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited.

1481
01:32:15,044 --> 01:32:16,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you a vague question.

1482
01:32:16,505 --> 01:32:17,925
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't want to answer it, that's fine.

1483
01:32:18,705 --> 01:32:20,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see anything that we didn't see at E3?

1484
01:32:22,546 --> 01:32:24,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I only saw people playing it.

1485
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:31,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get a chance to see any screens, but they looked like they were genuinely enjoying using that software and the hardware.

1486
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:34,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, these are real people, not actors?

1487
01:32:35,767 --> 01:32:36,627
[SPEAKER_06]: These are real people.

1488
01:32:36,827 --> 01:32:37,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow, okay.

1489
01:32:38,448 --> 01:32:41,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, but a lot of people at E3 had a lot of fun with it.

1490
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:41,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1491
01:32:41,691 --> 01:32:42,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun with the Wii at E3.

1492
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:44,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely buying one.

1493
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:44,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.

1494
01:32:45,453 --> 01:32:46,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I am too.

1495
01:32:47,574 --> 01:32:49,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for the price alone, because I know it's going to be under $250.

1496
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:51,116
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no question.

1497
01:32:51,697 --> 01:32:51,917
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1498
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on your mind tonight, Mr. DMN?

1499
01:32:55,485 --> 01:32:56,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.

1500
01:32:56,465 --> 01:32:59,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck for not staying in Seattle longer than two hours.

1501
01:32:59,406 --> 01:33:00,386
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a layover.

1502
01:33:00,446 --> 01:33:01,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a break.

1503
01:33:04,307 --> 01:33:04,567
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1504
01:33:04,587 --> 01:33:05,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for the birthday wishes.

1505
01:33:05,728 --> 01:33:06,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1506
01:33:06,428 --> 01:33:10,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad I went and got sunburned all over my scalp on my birthday.

1507
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:13,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's all gross and peeling and nasty.

1508
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:16,831
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll leave you with those happy thoughts, all right?

1509
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:17,851
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1510
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:18,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, guys.

1511
01:33:18,651 --> 01:33:19,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, buddy.

1512
01:33:19,772 --> 01:33:19,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1513
01:33:20,312 --> 01:33:20,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1514
01:33:22,283 --> 01:33:24,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other last minute stories anyone would like to share?

1515
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, never mind, we got another call.

1516
01:33:27,487 --> 01:33:28,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that was quick.

1517
01:33:28,067 --> 01:33:29,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1518
01:33:29,108 --> 01:33:29,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1519
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:30,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1520
01:33:30,649 --> 01:33:30,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1521
01:33:30,949 --> 01:33:31,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven's Dolphin.

1522
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:33,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, you call every week and you manage to get through.

1523
01:33:34,211 --> 01:33:34,892
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got the luck.

1524
01:33:34,932 --> 01:33:36,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

1525
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:37,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe I missed this.

1526
01:33:38,454 --> 01:33:39,014
[SPEAKER_06]: You missed what?

1527
01:33:39,935 --> 01:33:40,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1528
01:33:41,096 --> 01:33:45,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, we didn't really play up the fact that we were taping on Thursday this week.

1529
01:33:45,158 --> 01:33:46,119
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, life goes on.

1530
01:33:46,339 --> 01:33:48,901
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of the show you heard so far?

1531
01:33:48,961 --> 01:33:50,842
[SPEAKER_06]: You can download the rest on Sunday like everyone else.

1532
01:33:51,365 --> 01:33:53,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I have two things a lot, Skype.

1533
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, stuff about that.

1534
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:57,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I just called in to say... What was I supposed to call in to say?

1535
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh... Phoenix Wright Rules.

1536
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:02,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1537
01:34:04,213 --> 01:34:06,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh... What else?

1538
01:34:06,594 --> 01:34:10,997
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox... Oh, do you have any problems with the Xbox hooking up to your PC?

1539
01:34:12,437 --> 01:34:12,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1540
01:34:13,098 --> 01:34:14,078
[SPEAKER_06]: No, mine works fine.

1541
01:34:14,339 --> 01:34:16,360
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of problems are you having with the Xbox and the PC?

1542
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just don't want to do it.

1543
01:34:19,342 --> 01:34:19,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

1544
01:34:20,549 --> 01:34:22,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have Service Pack 2 installed on your PC?

1545
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:23,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got everything.

1546
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:24,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't want to do it.

1547
01:34:29,191 --> 01:34:32,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been so long since I did it, I don't even remember what the process was.

1548
01:34:33,032 --> 01:34:38,454
[SPEAKER_06]: What point of the process, like are you trying to sync it on, like you downloaded the program on the PC, right?

1549
01:34:38,914 --> 01:34:39,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1550
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:40,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just doesn't see your Xbox at all?

1551
01:34:41,235 --> 01:34:41,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't see it.

1552
01:34:41,815 --> 01:34:43,115
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes like, hey, nothing.

1553
01:34:43,515 --> 01:34:44,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to hell.

1554
01:34:44,756 --> 01:34:45,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

1555
01:34:45,296 --> 01:34:46,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys on wireless networks?

1556
01:34:47,389 --> 01:34:48,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, wireless wired.

1557
01:34:48,669 --> 01:34:52,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have your Xbox 360 hooked to a wireless router of its own?

1558
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:57,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's not going to pick up just, like, it doesn't have Wi-Fi built inside it.

1559
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:59,172
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have a separate... Yeah, yeah.

1560
01:34:59,292 --> 01:35:00,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to figure that out.

1561
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:01,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, maybe that's what's wrong.

1562
01:35:03,633 --> 01:35:06,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I have one last thing to say.

1563
01:35:06,794 --> 01:35:07,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1564
01:35:08,054 --> 01:35:09,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to buy a PS3.

1565
01:35:10,315 --> 01:35:11,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't say anything.

1566
01:35:11,675 --> 01:35:11,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1567
01:35:12,455 --> 01:35:15,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then why, what is making you deciding to buy a PS3?

1568
01:35:16,912 --> 01:35:19,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the Blu-ray, I want to see how it works.

1569
01:35:19,773 --> 01:35:24,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to spend $500, $600 on a console to see how it works.

1570
01:35:26,194 --> 01:35:28,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I have no time.

1571
01:35:28,455 --> 01:35:31,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't you just look at a demo at retail and make a decision there?

1572
01:35:32,056 --> 01:35:33,896
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll take this home and destroy it.

1573
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:35,156
[SPEAKER_06]: See, then you sound like a collector.

1574
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:43,449
[SPEAKER_06]: You sound like one of the hardcore dorks that has to have it all, like DarkSakura and myself.

1575
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:45,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's kind of it.

1576
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:48,873
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I still have my original Game Boy and my Game Boy Color in my pocket.

1577
01:35:49,753 --> 01:35:50,474
[SPEAKER_06]: See, there you go.

1578
01:35:50,614 --> 01:35:51,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew you were a nerd.

1579
01:35:51,975 --> 01:35:53,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Only nerds listen to this show, right?

1580
01:35:54,456 --> 01:35:55,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess so.

1581
01:35:55,097 --> 01:35:56,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, any other thoughts, Raven Stolfen?

1582
01:35:57,198 --> 01:35:58,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Only nerds host this show.

1583
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

1584
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:04,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say that I can't believe I missed it.

1585
01:36:05,643 --> 01:36:06,724
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1586
01:36:07,084 --> 01:36:07,604
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back.

1587
01:36:07,825 --> 01:36:12,748
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to pre-tape next week's show on Saturday night because I'm going back to L.A.

1588
01:36:12,768 --> 01:36:13,609
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

1589
01:36:13,649 --> 01:36:18,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a crazy schedule, and I appreciate DarkSakura and Loki putting up with my crap schedule.

1590
01:36:19,132 --> 01:36:21,574
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll be taping on Saturday next week.

1591
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:21,974
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1592
01:36:22,515 --> 01:36:23,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday.

1593
01:36:23,435 --> 01:36:23,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1594
01:36:23,936 --> 01:36:24,136
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1595
01:36:24,156 --> 01:36:24,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1596
01:36:26,658 --> 01:36:27,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see if anyone else wants to get through.

1597
01:36:27,859 --> 01:36:28,919
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go for one more call.

1598
01:36:28,999 --> 01:36:30,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have a last-minute story they want to do?

1599
01:36:30,961 --> 01:36:32,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple last-minute stories.

1600
01:36:32,102 --> 01:36:32,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1601
01:36:32,522 --> 01:36:32,642
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1602
01:36:33,798 --> 01:36:40,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Code Masters is working on trying to get the original Sensible Soccer that was on Amigo, or Sensible World of Soccer, I'm sorry.

1603
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:44,661
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually supposed to be an unlockable in Sensible Soccer 2006.

1604
01:36:45,761 --> 01:36:51,822
[SPEAKER_08]: They couldn't do it, so they're actually trying to, there's talk about them putting a Sensible World of Soccer on Xbox Live Arcade.

1605
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:54,183
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for our UK friends, by the way.

1606
01:36:54,343 --> 01:36:55,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for new arcade games.

1607
01:36:55,763 --> 01:36:58,444
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a call coming in, so I'm going to interrupt you before the second story.

1608
01:36:59,127 --> 01:37:00,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1609
01:37:00,087 --> 01:37:00,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1610
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:01,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ranma.

1611
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:02,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else would it be?

1612
01:37:02,968 --> 01:37:04,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma!

1613
01:37:04,228 --> 01:37:06,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, are you the one that gave up boners for Lent?

1614
01:37:07,829 --> 01:37:08,389
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that wasn't me.

1615
01:37:08,409 --> 01:37:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Loki.

1616
01:37:09,149 --> 01:37:09,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1617
01:37:09,389 --> 01:37:10,730
[SPEAKER_06]: That was explicit.

1618
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:12,170
[SPEAKER_06]: That would never be Loki.

1619
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,030
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was explicit.

1620
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:14,411
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not passing the buck.

1621
01:37:14,651 --> 01:37:15,831
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, what's on your mind, Ranma?

1622
01:37:16,531 --> 01:37:19,792
[SPEAKER_02]: DOA the movie will rock because of one reason and one reason only.

1623
01:37:20,232 --> 01:37:21,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

1624
01:37:21,332 --> 01:37:23,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it because that chick from Sin City's in it?

1625
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:23,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1626
01:37:24,393 --> 01:37:24,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it.

1627
01:37:25,153 --> 01:37:25,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it.

1628
01:37:25,953 --> 01:37:27,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I can read a straight guy's mind.

1629
01:37:27,534 --> 01:37:28,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I know exactly...

1630
01:37:29,164 --> 01:37:30,826
[SPEAKER_08]: What's her face from... She doesn't get naked.

1631
01:37:31,106 --> 01:37:34,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Too Fast, Too Furious is in it, too, as Kasumi.

1632
01:37:34,129 --> 01:37:34,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that the same chick?

1633
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:35,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1634
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:36,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same chick.

1635
01:37:37,773 --> 01:37:38,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see Sin City?

1636
01:37:38,774 --> 01:37:39,014
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1637
01:37:39,435 --> 01:37:39,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1638
01:37:39,675 --> 01:37:40,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it.

1639
01:37:40,095 --> 01:37:41,036
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

1640
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:43,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Sin City was okay.

1641
01:37:43,339 --> 01:37:45,601
[SPEAKER_06]: A little overrated by the dork culture, I think.

1642
01:37:45,661 --> 01:37:46,362
[SPEAKER_06]: A little overrated.

1643
01:37:46,502 --> 01:37:47,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it was all that.

1644
01:37:47,783 --> 01:37:50,726
[SPEAKER_06]: But if Angelina Jolie truly isn't the second one, that's pretty hot.

1645
01:37:50,766 --> 01:37:51,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I actually...

1646
01:37:52,583 --> 01:38:03,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I hate tabloid news, and I don't know what the fuck this has to do with gaming, as much as I hate tabloid news and all that stuff, I actually really like Angelina Jolie.

1647
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:06,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she's supposed to be doing Tomb Raider 3 right now, so hey.

1648
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:08,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well I guess that is game related then, thank you.

1649
01:38:09,452 --> 01:38:15,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So what else is on your mind besides making love to whatever her name is, Devon is her name?

1650
01:38:15,975 --> 01:38:16,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Devon Aoki.

1651
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:17,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Devon Aoki.

1652
01:38:18,637 --> 01:38:20,958
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is on your mind besides making sweet love to her?

1653
01:38:21,698 --> 01:38:25,459
[SPEAKER_02]: The Circuit City $8.96 massive fire sale.

1654
01:38:25,719 --> 01:38:27,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I heard about this.

1655
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:30,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't they like selling Final Fantasy 4?

1656
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you bring this up on Sunday's show?

1657
01:38:32,461 --> 01:38:33,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's a blur now.

1658
01:38:33,141 --> 01:38:36,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't they selling like Final Fantasy 4 for like $9 and you could turn around and sell it at Walmart for $18?

1659
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:38,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't me.

1660
01:38:39,002 --> 01:38:41,323
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Set Rock 1215 and SSJ100.

1661
01:38:41,783 --> 01:38:45,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I can't do it because I'm not crossing the bridge to Jersey to pull it off.

1662
01:38:46,264 --> 01:38:50,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'd read it on the forums or where the hell I'd read that, but I was like, that's dirty.

1663
01:38:50,765 --> 01:38:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dirty.

1664
01:38:52,363 --> 01:38:53,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you go to the sale?

1665
01:38:53,224 --> 01:38:53,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you pick anything up?

1666
01:38:54,364 --> 01:38:55,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I went Saturday morning.

1667
01:38:56,025 --> 01:38:58,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit three different Circuit City.

1668
01:38:59,047 --> 01:39:02,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I got The Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, Pitfall Bundled.

1669
01:39:02,568 --> 01:39:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Dig Dug, Digging Strike.

1670
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:08,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I also picked up Final Fantasy IV, but it was $19.99.

1671
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:13,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be going down to $8.96 next week, so I'm going to get that price match.

1672
01:39:13,274 --> 01:39:14,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, they have Digging Strike?

1673
01:39:14,535 --> 01:39:15,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want that.

1674
01:39:16,756 --> 01:39:18,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have it sealed if you want it.

1675
01:39:19,097 --> 01:39:19,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1676
01:39:20,198 --> 01:39:20,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want it.

1677
01:39:21,973 --> 01:39:22,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me an email.

1678
01:39:22,894 --> 01:39:23,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

1679
01:39:23,194 --> 01:39:24,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Dig Dug.

1680
01:39:24,575 --> 01:39:26,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I've really been curious to check out the DS one.

1681
01:39:27,317 --> 01:39:29,259
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing else coming out this week.

1682
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:30,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe when my trips die down, though.

1683
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to check our local Circuit City.

1684
01:39:32,141 --> 01:39:34,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't have it, then I'll shoot you an email.

1685
01:39:34,943 --> 01:39:36,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also picked up Dr. Mario Puzzle League.

1686
01:39:37,486 --> 01:39:37,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that reminds me.

1687
01:39:37,946 --> 01:39:39,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris DS should have been called Tetris Classic NES Edition.

1688
01:40:07,003 --> 01:40:15,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Tetris D, yeah, I mean, sure, they hoard the NES stuff, but what's also interesting about it is that there was so much more there than just Tetris.

1689
01:40:15,665 --> 01:40:21,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that mode, I can't remember what it's called, but the Metroid one, with Metroid in the background, I think it's a different game altogether.

1690
01:40:22,566 --> 01:40:29,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing through the game, I hear the remix from Gyromite, I almost fell out of my seat, flipping out how awesome that was, and I realized, damn, I'm old.

1691
01:40:29,887 --> 01:40:32,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo knows how to milk their retro factor.

1692
01:40:33,068 --> 01:40:33,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe it.

1693
01:40:33,368 --> 01:40:33,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Got that right.

1694
01:40:34,148 --> 01:40:34,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe it.

1695
01:40:34,748 --> 01:40:35,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on your mind, Rama?

1696
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:41,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Next Sunday, when the sale is official, I'm going to hit those Circuit City stores again for two more games.

1697
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:43,549
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't have it, I'm bringing my papers.

1698
01:40:43,629 --> 01:40:48,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Best Buy, Target, all in just a price match and track the games down.

1699
01:40:48,272 --> 01:40:48,512
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1700
01:40:48,532 --> 01:40:51,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep us posted on your bargain hunting process, okay?

1701
01:40:51,534 --> 01:40:52,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I will be.

1702
01:40:52,675 --> 01:40:52,935
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1703
01:40:52,955 --> 01:40:53,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Ranma.

1704
01:40:53,695 --> 01:40:54,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1705
01:40:54,035 --> 01:40:54,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.

1706
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And stay away from those boners.

1707
01:40:55,957 --> 01:40:56,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Runtime.

1708
01:40:56,897 --> 01:40:57,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Final May 2007.

1709
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:00,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet brew party.

1710
01:41:00,699 --> 01:41:01,240
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it.

1711
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:01,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1712
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,161
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, crazy kids.

1713
01:41:03,401 --> 01:41:03,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1714
01:41:04,221 --> 01:41:04,502
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1715
01:41:04,842 --> 01:41:05,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1716
01:41:05,967 --> 01:41:07,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you just say holla at the end?

1717
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:10,691
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's all the calls for tonight, kids.

1718
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:14,115
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start to wrap things up here with one more story.

1719
01:41:14,955 --> 01:41:15,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

1720
01:41:15,556 --> 01:41:16,337
[SPEAKER_06]: You had your last minute thing.

1721
01:41:16,357 --> 01:41:16,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, DarkSakura.

1722
01:41:16,897 --> 01:41:18,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and you completely cut me off.

1723
01:41:18,819 --> 01:41:19,720
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

1724
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, then Von Chun is very well worth it.

1725
01:41:21,401 --> 01:41:23,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some news for our World of Warcraft players.

1726
01:41:24,544 --> 01:41:24,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1727
01:41:24,844 --> 01:41:25,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Then this is something I might want to know.

1728
01:41:26,146 --> 01:41:26,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

1729
01:41:26,606 --> 01:41:27,747
[SPEAKER_08]: The Realm Transfer went live.

1730
01:41:28,488 --> 01:41:30,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Five servers are supporting it right now.

1731
01:41:31,408 --> 01:41:36,853
[SPEAKER_08]: is Altar of Storms, Argent Dawn, Demon's Soul, Illidian, and Warsong.

1732
01:41:37,274 --> 01:41:39,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Others are going to be following soon.

1733
01:41:39,395 --> 01:41:44,981
[SPEAKER_08]: European players should see it coming up not too far afterwards.

1734
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, it is $25 to move between servers.

1735
01:41:48,023 --> 01:41:51,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Just check out Blizzard's site on worldofwarcraft.com.

1736
01:41:51,967 --> 01:41:55,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, World of Warcraft Burning Crusade.

1737
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:57,152
[SPEAKER_08]: The trailer is out now.

1738
01:41:57,859 --> 01:42:01,961
[SPEAKER_08]: There is showing off what the new accessory in the game is.

1739
01:42:02,701 --> 01:42:03,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Flying Mount.

1740
01:42:05,682 --> 01:42:07,423
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a lot of people excited about that.

1741
01:42:07,843 --> 01:42:12,145
[SPEAKER_08]: The trailer is actually available on Eurogamer TV.

1742
01:42:12,305 --> 01:42:20,168
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to Eurogamer.net slash TV video, there should be a link up there to it.

1743
01:42:20,848 --> 01:42:22,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be watching that shortly.

1744
01:42:23,029 --> 01:42:24,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Last up is Dance Factory.

1745
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:31,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, basically, it's, uh, trying to, I guess, dethrone Dancing Stage in the UK, with Dancing Stage being DDR.

1746
01:42:31,471 --> 01:42:35,732
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this really crappy, um, game that you can put, it's made by Comaster.

1747
01:42:35,832 --> 01:42:39,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I was... You put it in a CD and it generates steps for you.

1748
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:41,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a neat concept.

1749
01:42:41,653 --> 01:42:42,814
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is a neat concept.

1750
01:42:43,174 --> 01:42:52,075
[SPEAKER_08]: However, part of the fun of DDR is, you know, the interesting things that Konami likes to pass us in the music.

1751
01:42:54,056 --> 01:42:54,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh,

1752
01:42:55,011 --> 01:42:56,932
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my last minute news.

1753
01:42:57,872 --> 01:43:00,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're interested in playing Diner Dash on your PSP.

1754
01:43:00,973 --> 01:43:03,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I've played Diner Dash 2 on the computer.

1755
01:43:04,054 --> 01:43:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ask me why.

1756
01:43:05,214 --> 01:43:06,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I think because Loki was playing it at E3.

1757
01:43:06,935 --> 01:43:09,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I want to play that.

1758
01:43:09,476 --> 01:43:11,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually downloaded it.

1759
01:43:11,336 --> 01:43:12,136
[SPEAKER_06]: How sad am I?

1760
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:14,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have one more bit of news also for our UK listeners.

1761
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Disgaea 2 is coming out in the UK.

1762
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:20,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I damn well hope so.

1763
01:43:20,599 --> 01:43:23,100
[SPEAKER_06]: That has a huge cult following to it.

1764
01:43:24,025 --> 01:43:24,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to hear.

1765
01:43:24,646 --> 01:43:26,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks pretty interesting at E3.

1766
01:43:26,827 --> 01:43:27,068
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1767
01:43:27,308 --> 01:43:28,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's it, I promise.

1768
01:43:28,989 --> 01:43:29,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1769
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:29,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Dot com.

1770
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:31,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

1771
01:43:31,932 --> 01:43:36,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, we've got a last minute story here.

1772
01:43:38,237 --> 01:43:38,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill.

1773
01:43:39,278 --> 01:43:43,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we know that the Japanese are really trying to promote the movie over there.

1774
01:43:44,122 --> 01:43:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's kind of interesting is they're doing this brand new kind of like a cafe thing.

1775
01:43:52,448 --> 01:44:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Akihabara's Made in Japan That's pretty much the whole electronic district Made in Japan It's basically a cafe that's covered with Silent Hill posters which are just everywhere all sorts of memorabilia including white nurse zombies in super short skirts serving red pyramid curry and tomato juice That's awesome

1776
01:44:22,353 --> 01:44:26,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the pictures on that site, they had the little pyramid head guy in the back.

1777
01:44:26,456 --> 01:44:27,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you post that in your live journal?

1778
01:44:28,077 --> 01:44:29,177
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was something else.

1779
01:44:29,217 --> 01:44:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: That was from the haunted house.

1780
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:31,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

1781
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:32,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is different.

1782
01:44:32,559 --> 01:44:32,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1783
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:34,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is something different.

1784
01:44:35,241 --> 01:44:36,041
[SPEAKER_04]: They are pretty hot.

1785
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:37,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Nurses are pretty hot.

1786
01:44:37,482 --> 01:44:38,823
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't look like zombies.

1787
01:44:39,283 --> 01:44:39,644
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1788
01:44:41,305 --> 01:44:43,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you're in Japan, check it out.

1789
01:44:43,946 --> 01:44:44,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Take pictures.

01:44:44,567 --> 01:44:45,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Send them to us.

1791
01:44:45,914 --> 01:44:55,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at the Japanese website, it's maidin.jp slash silent.html.

1792
01:44:56,517 --> 01:44:57,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's some very interesting stuff.

1793
01:44:58,058 --> 01:45:08,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it has a picture of the tomato juice and it has a picture of the pyramid head curry, which looks very tasty, actually.

1794
01:45:09,001 --> 01:45:10,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1795
01:45:10,121 --> 01:45:12,022
[SPEAKER_06]: If you saw the movie, it might not be so tasty.

1796
01:45:13,306 --> 01:45:16,548
[SPEAKER_08]: and a huge-ass picture of Red Pyramid sitting in the background.

1797
01:45:16,568 --> 01:45:17,228
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty hot.

1798
01:45:18,329 --> 01:45:18,649
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1799
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:20,150

[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1818
01:46:02,442 --> 01:46:03,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting to that.

[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine.

1820
01:46:04,043 --> 01:46:05,184

[SPEAKER_06]: What's your final thought?

1822
01:46:06,744 --> 01:46:07,824

1825
01:46:10,386 --> 01:46:11,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Eat your red pyramid curry.

1826
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,267
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I hope you washed it.

1827
01:46:15,308 --> 01:46:16,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, baby, just for you.

1828
01:46:17,008 --> 01:46:18,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

1829
01:46:18,709 --> 01:46:21,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't find this trademark and it's driving me nuts.

1830
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:22,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's here.

1831
01:46:23,451 --> 01:46:28,653
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is it's really hard to search this stupid Japanese trademark database.

1832
01:46:29,193 --> 01:46:29,473
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1833
01:46:30,114 --> 01:46:31,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great week, kids.
