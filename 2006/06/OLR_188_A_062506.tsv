14287	16151	Tonight, June 25th, 2006.
16792	19396	Interesting developments with the Xbox Live Arcade.
19737	21580	TiVo is coming to your PSP.
22061	25167	And happy birthday to... Sonic the Hedgehog.
32165	36909	Good evening everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
37149	43674	It is June 25th, 2006 and you're listening to episode number 188 of our little program.
44114	46516	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
46616	50238	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50539	51039	Hi.
51299	51900	How you doing?
52920	53481	Sleepy.
53881	54361	Yeah, me too.
54381	55302	I'm a little exhausted.
55322	56703	I'll get into wine in a little while though.
57003	59225	But say hello also to Loki.
60166	60406	Hi.
60426	60466	Hi.
60851	61271	How you doing?
61732	62072	I'm okay.
62272	62512	Great.
63132	67735	Also joining us tonight, say hello to our special guest, the 23rd Magus.
68015	68515	Yo, what's up?
68916	69316	How you doing?
69636	70176	Caffeinated.
70557	71817	Now, you just had a birthday recently.
72018	72858	Oh yeah, 21st.
73098	74519	Yeah, I was going to say, it's a big one.
74579	74939	It's 21st.
75099	76700	So how did you celebrate the 21st birthday?
76720	78521	Did you go to a bar, get tossed?
78561	78761	What?
79342	80422	Had a Guinness, went to bed.
81403	81923	Not much.
82283	82944	All right, that's all right.
83804	87246	But I think my 21st birthday was probably about that exciting too, so it's all good.
87286	87767	No big deal.
88067	88327	All right.
89011	92552	Yeah, it's like you do everything bad and then when you're 21 it's like, eh, no big deal.
92572	93672	Yeah.
94012	95432	Now I'm actually old enough to be doing this.
95492	96773	Now I can do it legally.
97293	98193	Oh, what's the reason to?
99233	99493	All right.
100793	102914	Let's go ahead and start this show off.
102934	106495	We are here to talk about video games and gaming news and all that good stuff.
106515	108715	And we're going to get into how is your gaming week.

145802	147283	The First Episode of Orange Lounge Radio
177459	183382	Antidisestablishmentarianism Duck Hunt We just dated ourselves I'm the low B here You need to gain a few more levels
203755	204396	DarkSakura, start us off!
229036	233920	I played a little World of Warcraft pretty much long enough to make a character on a server with my coworkers.
234401	236282	Yeah, my coworkers play World of Warcraft.
237343	239024	Played some Animal Crossing.
240406	247591	Holding off getting my copy of Oendon for a little bit just because stupid stuff getting in the way of my fun.
247691	249433	And I did my tabletop gaming this week.
250273	251494	Yes, I do tabletop gaming.
253076	254597	That's really about it.
256819	257119	All right.
257930	259411	What kind of tabletop game are you guys playing?
259431	260291	We're playing Werewolf.
261211	263572	Our Buffy game is on hiatus for a season.
264933	268995	Not only have you dated yourself this evening, now you've made yourself an obvious nerd.
269015	270595	I don't care.
270755	272176	Who plays Buffy roleplay?
272196	274957	You've got to be a hardcore nerd to be doing Buffy roleplay.
277158	278919	You're the one that picked up the GURPS book today.
279399	280619	I didn't know what it was.
280799	281860	I was like, what's a GURP?
281920	282640	Is that like a LARP?
283000	284301	I didn't know.
284561	286982	Actually, my second roleplay ever was GURPS.
288075	290956	My third was Shadowrun.
290996	291976	My fourth was D&D.
292236	293657	Okay, you have dated yourself.
293837	298098	I have definitely not progressed past third edition D&D.
298938	300559	I refuse to play third edition.
301079	302360	I started on second edition.
303080	305641	I still had first edition books.
305881	308862	You're not the first person I've heard say something negative about third edition.
308902	309642	What's so bad about it?
310042	310462	Everything.
311202	314863	Except for constitution-based magic casting, I miss Thacko.
315524	316404	I mean, it's so easy.
317875	319076	Call of Duty 2 Call of Duty 2
338905	340166	Download for free to work.
340546	350411	And there was one of the maps that had this giant silo on it, and you basically climb up to the top and snipe people down from the top of the... So that's actually pretty fun, to play just that map.
351112	354493	Played a little bit more Blazing Angels, trying to beat the damn thing all the way.
355314	360156	I played a little bit of Mutant Storm Reloaded, because I'm on level 89, and I have to beat it.
360737	366460	But then again, all the effort I put into that, and I looked at the achievement that that unlocks, and that's like 15 points.
366520	366740	I'm like,
367298	368779	is it really worth the 15 points?
369639	373081	Well, if you're on level 89 at this point, you might as well finish it.
373501	374381	How many levels are there?
374541	376582	It's like 95 or something, right?
376762	377663	No, 89.
377903	380164	So you're on the very last level and you just can't beat it?
380924	381644	Well, here's the thing.
381765	384806	The difficulty, like, it ramps up very strange.
385486	389428	It gets really hard, then it kind of gets easier, then it's super duper hard.
389948	390929	So, I don't get it.
391429	391629	But...
392679	393919	I don't know, it's an okay game.
393959	396380	I just need to finish this and get the damn achievement.
398480	401981	I played Gauntlet for a little bit, and I don't know why.
403961	404682	But yeah, I tried that.
404862	405482	Achievement points?
405502	406462	You want more achievement points?
407382	411383	I think I was looking at your profile, and you don't have any achievement points for Gauntlet, and I have like 25.
411463	413343	Therefore, I am the better Gauntlet player than you.
413363	414924	It's because I haven't played Gauntlet.
415604	416004	Whatever.
416184	419205	Anyways, what else did I play?
420385	421205	I think I played...
422566	423066	Wack-a-mole
443004	443744	A whole lot of that.
443944	446306	We've been trying to see how we can exploit the demo.
446586	448086	I keep forgetting to download that.
448447	452348	It's fun because the cars, the police cars are stupid.
452468	456690	They downloaded that at Arena the week of E3 and I played it like once and it was kind of cool.
456770	463093	Like, I haven't been excited about a test drive game since like the days of Commodore 64 and this one looks pretty neat.
463453	464474	So I'm excited.
465074	471157	We managed to, I was playing it, the Lamborghini goes quite fast off-road, ironically enough, and
471601	473842	The police cannot get you if you're off-road.
474602	478723	Then we took an SUV, we slammed into it, and we knocked it into the ocean.
478743	479203	Well done.
479243	480163	You should get points for that.
480243	490926	We knocked it into the ocean, which is supposed to be just, like, you know, a few inches deep when it's washing ashore, but apparently the way the game's designed, it's just a cliff, and the car just disappeared.
491246	495467	And I jumped the fence, and I jumped into this yard that I couldn't get out of, which was fun.
496047	498608	And I also got my car smashed...
499412	503474	Stuck Between a Rock and a House, and what other fun stuff did we do?
503814	505134	Oh yeah, we jumped a mountain.
505595	506175	That was fun.
508376	513858	But the game is very flawed, but I guess it's just a demo right now.
513898	517740	It's obviously not even near finished, but there's a lot of things that got fixed on that.
518460	519681	A lot, a lot of things.
519881	521301	But I don't know, we'll see.
521982	524903	This is the game that my boss says we'll get him to buy in Xbox 360.
525203	527744	I'm like, you know, there's a lot of better games out there.
528448	529449	Why this one?
529929	530589	But whatever.
532030	533151	Alright.
533311	535452	My gaming week was also kind of unexciting.
535492	536793	I didn't really play a lot of new stuff.
536833	541435	I played Burnout, you know, because there's nothing more fun than doing the synth pop.
541895	543876	Burnout, running through the traffic attack.
544197	549539	And then once in a while I'll throw in Journey Greatest Hits or ABBA or something like really, you know, weird.
550500	551540	But it's fun to drive to.
552501	554302	And then I was playing World of Warcraft.
554910	557632	I was on LA for most of the week with a business trip.
557932	565938	Which reminds me, if you go to All Games Interactive's show, and I know a lot of you guys listen to them over at allgames.com, I'm on their Tuesday show this week.
566594	574737	because I dropped by Arena right after work on Tuesday, and I was in a really bad mood on Tuesday.
574757	575338	Well, I know I was wrong.
575618	583761	I woke up at 3.30 in the morning on Tuesday, so I really beat up on a couple of their regulars, and I almost felt bad when I listened to the playback of the show.
583801	585362	I was like, God, I was rude.
585742	590264	It's like going to someone's house and drinking all their soda and eating all their food.
590284	593145	That's kind of what I did on Tuesday, so
593632	595432	Check it out if you want to see me being a bitch.
596633	600993	Otherwise, as far as new games go, I did look at Big Brain Academy for like five seconds.
601673	604254	Fortunately, I'll have to wait and give a full review on that next week.
604794	606234	However, let me talk about a book.
607294	609975	And you might be thinking, wait, why would you talk about a book on a video game show?
609995	610995	Because it has to do with gaming.
612015	621597	My birthday happens to be tomorrow, and Dark Sakura treated me to a queen for a day, took me out to lunch, took me out to dessert, and then took me to a bookstore and said...
622168	622548	I Am 8-Bit
648519	653902	And Mario looks kind of, yeah, it's got a little titty in the book, which makes it even better, right?
653922	654402	Some porn.
654902	657564	No, no, no, you said it was erotica.
657704	658784	Yeah, I'm sorry, it was erotica.
658904	661426	Because Jamie was making fun of me, like, ah, you're buying porn.
661466	663046	I was like, no, it's erotica.
663807	666728	But Mario's all looking confused, like he doesn't know what to do.
667068	671271	But you see, you know how sometimes guys, when they don't know what to do, they'll write notes on their hand?
671611	674112	Like, you know, when they want to break up and don't know what to say, they'll write it on their hand?
674502	674942	I Am 8-Bit
703732	705856	WonderDog Harold says, I'm sorry Mario, but my dress is in another castle.
714364	716386	In reference to the photo I was describing there.
716747	717287	That was funny.
717307	717888	That was a good time.
735060	740370	and to the chatter that gets the most points or the average points, the best average points, wins a Wii.
740831	743435	So it just is incentive to participate live in our chat room.
743455	746481	So if you're not there, you should be asking yourself, why am I not there?
748820	750481	Anyway, getting into some gaming news tonight.
750541	752922	We are not the only ones celebrating a birthday today.
753463	757305	Actually, Sonic is also celebrating his 15th anniversary.
757685	759206	And GameTap's getting in on the fun.
759226	766050	They're offering subscribers a trio of titles, which are the lock-on versions of Sonic.
766090	772634	For instance, Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles, Knuckles and Sonic 2, and Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles.
772674	776836	Remember how you could use the cart and plug it into the old carts and you have a new game?
777016	777777	That was amazing.
777897	778097	Yeah.
779642	783746	What a cute technology that you never really saw outside of that.
783766	784567	At least I don't remember it.
784707	792315	I liked how you could plug in random Sega games on the cartridge, and then you could do the special stages in different ways with different games.
792615	792875	Really?
792915	794437	I didn't even know you could use it with other games.
794477	796199	You'd have to... Oh, I forgot what it was.
796219	801184	You had to hold down the buttons while you loaded the game, and it would load up all the special stages on different cartridges.
801864	802465	That's kind of cool.
803166	803586	I like that.
804195	806376	Well, anyway, you can download those on GameTap.
806436	809918	No plug-in, no cartridges needed, all that good stuff if you're a GameTap member.
811399	817263	Also, they added on to GameTap TV three behind-the-scenes looks at Sonic the Hedgehog.
817323	826288	So if you like to watch that stuff that GameTap TV produces, which is far better than anything GeForce is producing currently, check it out.
826789	827249	It's a good time.
828366	835048	Also, just to join in on the fun here, Sega has revealed that they're going to be doing two new portable Sonic games.
835648	838269	And there's a first look at those screens there.
838349	844890	What they're basically doing is that they're going to do Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis for the Game Boy Advance.
845310	847311	And it's going to have additions to...
849267	851108	I played the hell out of that at E3 Oh, what'd you think?
851148	855610	Oh, it's so good And I won all the time and they gave me a t-shirt But it really is, it's almost like playing, you know
877702	884326	Old School Sonic with updated graphics, but instead your goal is just to make it through the level as fast as humanly possible.
884346	887648	It's like doing the old Tails races in Sonic Adventure.
888228	888628	Very cool.
889009	889829	Just on 2D.
891450	891710	Alright.
895372	896473	Alright, sounds good.
896633	897374	Did you play it at all?
897814	898734	No, I didn't.
898975	901976	Oh, it's definitely one that I would suggest everyone to get out.
902076	902537	But you know...
903886	907447	We've had a lot of game purchases go on lately.
907907	914469	You know, Mario cut half a million copies in the US in over one month.
914709	915369	Just over a month.
916689	918970	They're saying basically 20 copies were sold every minute.
919930	922891	Which I think they did the math and that didn't end up being correct.
923011	925271	But, you know, it's a lot.
925651	927252	Well, in the first two days they sold 136,500 units.
927612	927712	Wow.
927732	928392	So, basically, that's just
935032	937934	Pretty hardcore for game sales.
938074	939015	Half a million, you said?
939536	940096	Half a million, 500,000.
941477	945221	That's pretty darn good for a game that really hasn't been out that long, all things considered.
945641	946542	It's at the top of the charts.
946722	947623	Yeah, absolutely.
947803	951786	So it's having the same... The rated E games are taking over.
952287	957892	It's having the same non-stop hysteria-ness here that it's been having in Japan, essentially.
958572	961615	This goes to show that old school will win you points for the masses.
962825	964527	Especially when it comes to Nintendo.
965167	965848	You know, I don't know.
966208	973135	If Sony were to release a new Crash Bandicoot for the PSP, I don't know if it would have the same... Yeah, I don't know.
973416	975698	Because Crash Bandicoot, they've really beaten into the ground.
975738	983265	But isn't that weird that we feel burnt out on Crash Bandicoot, yet Nintendo has way hord Mario more often.
983285	985628	They don't need to deviate from the formula, because it works.
987145	991207	The other thing too is Crash Bandicoot is in the first party character.
991748	994829	I don't know, I tried to think of a Sony mascot and that's the best thing I can come up with.
994869	999432	Well, that's because it was at one point their mascot because that's all they really had.
1000172	1002274	And now they don't really have a mascot.
1002294	1006356	They have giant crabs, I guess.
1007436	1008917	Giant crabs could be the mascot.
1011539	1011879	I don't know.
1017628	1020390	XBOX Live Arcade is coming to the retailers!
1048368	1064862	and Casual Games would extend the 360's appeal to non-hardcore audiences and also those people that and I don't know why people don't have broadband yet but the people that don't have broadband can't download them but ironically enough
1066747	1072070	Information arrived to me this week, saying that actually this is going to be happening sooner than later.
1072850	1078593	There is going to be a game coming out in September called the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged.
1079113	1093700	And what it's going to contain is a few games, including Geometry Wars, Texas Hold'em, which is supposed to be coming out in July, I think, Wick, Bejeweled 2, Outpost's Cloaky X, Hardwood Backgammon, which I don't believe is out yet, and
1094440	1098363	No, Badgammon is on the marketplace, I'm pretty sure.
1098583	1101285	Hearts and Badgammon, I'm pretty sure, like the hardwood games or whatever.
1102306	1109532	We'll also come with a free month of gold, which they include with almost every game nowadays, and 100 free Microsoft points.
1110432	1112894	So you can download some crappy icons.
1113515	1115036	Because that's about what 100 points will buy you.
1115176	1115957	Yeah, pretty much.
1117658	1120160	But that's coming, and it's supposed to retail for about $39.99 for the whole package.
1122182	1128504	So that's pretty sweet if you don't have access to broadband and live and stuff.
1129805	1130825	Other than that, I don't know.
1131205	1135767	I could see them doing this later on and stuff with maybe some more games and stuff.
1136007	1139008	Now, you said the information came to you.
1139188	1140568	How did you get this?
1140688	1144309	Anonymous tip or were you listening in a top secret board meeting?
1144409	1151252	Because I saw on Joystick when they ran the article, I saw that there was a little addendum and they said, thanks for the tip, Loki.
1151272	1151692	And I'm like...
1152321	1152901	What the hell?
1152961	1154142	What is Loki doing?
1179677	1184063	I look every day at least like four or five times a day for new information.
1185666	1190152	That surprises me that the mainstream gaming press doesn't have their nose in retail somehow.
1190653	1191053	Well, they do.
1191073	1195480	They watch their Best Buy release dates and how awfully long those are.
1196664	1197845	Interesting, that's so interesting.
1198365	1203109	Well, also, Xbox Live, one thing they're definitely looking forward to over on Xbox Live is Luminous.
1203889	1209794	What's interesting about this, though, you know, we've talked a little bit about Luminous and how it's supposed to be one of the more expensive Xbox Live arcade games.
1209854	1212736	It's going to go for 1,200 Microsoft points or $15.
1212816	1219681	Get this, supposedly, it's not going to have Xbox Live multiplayer on it by default.
1220620	1232398	What's going on is Tetsuya Mitsugushi, who created the game, he actually detailed some plans where he's saying that the multiplayer support is going to be an add-on that's separately buyable.
1233319	1236604	Now, they have not finalized the decision on that.
1237335	1244178	But, um, that's basically saying that, okay, even though you're spending $15 on the game, it's not gonna be multiplayer unless you spend a little more money.
1244518	1251281	By the way, also, you're gonna have to do licensed music, backgrounds, that's all gonna be premium downloads as well.
1252181	1252682	So, hmm.
1253242	1259125	Uh, now, an interesting comparison's been made where, if you think about it, Luminous, when it first came out on the PSP, was $40.
1260325	1264707	So this makes this whole Luminous Live thing look like a real deal, but, uh,
1265305	1265966	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1292987	1294348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1316463	1327647	I kind of think, you know, if the creators of this game wanted to they could probably get away with releasing this as an over-the-counter title in the nice little clamshell and everything for $39.99.
1329557	1338500	You know, they release these games all the time, especially early on in a console's life period, where the game takes up very little space on the disc.
1338560	1340120	Think about the first PlayStation 2 games.
1340140	1341041	They were all on CD.
1341441	1343001	They barely took up any space at all.
1343381	1346342	So if the creators of this game wanted to, they didn't have to sell it on arcade.
1346362	1350284	They probably could have done an in-store release for $40 and gotten away with it.
1350544	1358026	I'll bet you anything they do that too, just like because now we're seeing it with, you know, the thing you were talking about where they have the arcade titles coming out.
1358406	1360667	for retail for those folks who aren't plugged in.
1361027	1363349	I'll bet you anything, Luminous does come out that way as well.
1363789	1371053	But, and only kind of when I put it in that light where it's, well, at least you're not paying 40 bucks for the clamshell, am I not pissed off about this.
1371273	1380738	Then you also get the games like Call of Duty 2 that released, you know, the game of your edition, which just basically has the game and the downloadable content for it on there.
1381918	1383719	And then they re-skew it as something new.
1384920	1385180	Hmm.
1385700	1386661	So, I don't know.
1386841	1387281	It's kind of,
1388268	1390469	Interesting way of, you know, selling things.
1390749	1393230	Going to our chatroom at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
1393270	1395291	Funnydale says, So, what are you telling me?
1395351	1401433	Is that a game that costs $20 on the PSP is going to cost me $200 to play the full version on Xbox Live?
1401893	1403074	Well, I don't know about $200.
1403114	1404274	That might be a little extreme.
1404394	1415939	But by the time all these micropayments and, you know, multiplayer and extra skins and stuff add up, yeah, you're probably looking at about $40, which is what the original game would have cost you on the PSP.
1416839	1432044	But again, I kind of go back to that scenario, you know, they could get away with... If they had never said this was going to be on arcade, if they just said Luminous is coming out for the Xbox 360, I don't think people would have batted an eye at a $40 price tag for it, because that's what all the other games cost.
1432344	1437346	But the thing is, and I would still be kind of pissed off about it, is that they didn't really do anything with...
1438321	1440682	The graphics and stuff, it's not improved in any way.
1441183	1442043	It's just a port.
1442243	1446966	From what we saw of Luminous 2 at E3, not a damn thing's changed there either.
1447506	1447706	Yeah.
1448226	1451668	So I don't know if that was just an early announcement build or something.
1451688	1454990	I hope so, because that would be very disappointing.
1455370	1465375	Luminous is a fantastic game, and I hope they're not going to screw the series by milking it without giving us something new with it.
1465902	1466162	I don't know.
1466182	1467763	Because that's kind of what happened with Tetris.
1467784	1470666	That's why Tetris kind of went downhill for a long time.
1470946	1478612	I mean, granted, it's had a resurgence a couple times, Tetris DS being the latest one, but there was a while there where we were just all burned out on Tetris, right?
1478952	1483156	You kind of see Tetris on the shelf, you go, oh, goody, another Tetris clone, right?
1483196	1483396	Yeah.
1483976	1492223	Well, speaking of live games, the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged wasn't the only thing that I heard about that was coming out.
1492263	1495065	We actually got updates on all of the Xbox...
1496132	1519263	360 accessories so they're going to be coming out including Xbox Live Vision which we now have a date which is supposed to be September 20th around there you know it shouldn't change too much I can confirm though it is going to be coming with Uno bundled in there as well as yet again a one month trial to Xbox Live Gold and a headset is going to be packaged with that as well
1519770	1523913	So you will be getting the nice little camera and all that other fun stuff.
1524153	1527915	What's also cool is the camera can work with your PC, which I think is really neat also.
1529696	1531757	No price yet on that though.
1531857	1539122	Also going to be coming out in November on the 15th so far is the 256 megabyte memory unit.
1539962	1542424	No price on that yet either, but of course...
1543869	1544349	for the Xbox 360.
1544430	1544790	And I also know...
1569637	1573778	that the HD DVD player is supposed to be coming out around that same time too.
1574778	1578219	So, good stuff.
1578999	1581720	Go into our chat room, orangelunchradio.com, click on chat.
1582020	1584381	GK128 says, Bastards already bought Uno.
1584481	1585741	I'm sure that's the way most of us feel.
1585921	1587581	Yeah.
1587621	1590102	What do we get if we already have Uno?
1590122	1591322	Are they going to give us some points?
1591342	1593303	They should just give us Microsoft points.
1593743	1597444	I think it's just going to be a sucker type thing.
1597524	1597844	Sucker.
1598342	1601203	You got to play for all these months before the game came out on shelves.
1601243	1605484	I'm surprised they don't sell the live arcade games in stores.
1606244	1620108	For example, when I bought my live 12-month kit that came with the headset, because I bought a core system and I didn't have a headset, which I never really used a headset either, but it came with Bank Shop Billiards 2.
1620948	1625669	It was just one of those cards that you pull the tab off and it has a code on it and you redeem it for a game.
1626330	1627830	I'm surprised they don't sell those in the stores.
1629824	1638928	My all thought was that the reason why they did it that way is because they're bypassing retail when they sell it on Xbox Live Arcade and that's how they can get away with doing it so cheap.
1638968	1641969	I mean, $5 for Geometry Wars, that's a freaking steal.
1642569	1652553	If they had released that game through a retailer, you would have had so many people to go through that want a bite of the money coming from the consumer, they would not be able to sell that game for $5.
1652713	1655735	It would have been at least $20, if not more.
1656335	1658956	So that's kind of why I always felt that
1659589	1660470	XBOX Live Arcade
1681292	1698893	Various games, Half-Life 2, Sin episodes, Darwinia, things like that Downloadable content, they can offer it for cheaper And in some cases a lot easier than just going to the store Okay
1700685	1703026	Anyway, also something that could be coming out for the 360.
1703807	1706168	We don't know if this is going to be for sure yet.
1706228	1708789	However, this is kind of interesting.
1709049	1712331	Apparently, Peter Moore recently gave an interview on another podcast.
1712351	1713291	We've talked about these guys before.
1713311	1713752	They're pretty cool.
1713792	1714612	Gamertag Radio.
1715332	1716373	They snagged Peter Moore.
1716413	1716893	Lucky guys.
1718034	1727698	When Peter Moore was on that station, he was saying that shoulder buttons, triggers, analog sticks, D-pads, there's a lot going on when you compare it to an Atari 2600 button and stick.
1730173	1741239	So basically what he's saying is that he's imagining that he's kind of insinuating that they're going to be doing a simpler controller, basically with the Xbox Live Arcade downloads in mind.
1741259	1749203	Because if you think about a lot of those Xbox Live Arcade downloads, Uno, Geometry Wars, you don't really use a lot of the buttons on the Xbox 360 controller.
1749683	1754826	They could get away with releasing a controller with one or two buttons, and most of the games would support that there.
1755266	1758468	Now, nothing is being confirmed by Microsoft directly,
1758988	1763190	But they're basically saying that, yeah, we're going to continue to innovate wherever we can.
1763230	1765310	But still, it's kind of interesting when Peter Moore says this.
1765370	1768011	You know he's in the know of what's going on at Microsoft.
1768071	1768972	That's so stupid.
1769752	1770232	What do you think?
1770712	1770872	Why?
1771333	1774374	If you're buying a 360, you obviously know how to use a controller anyways.
1774994	1775454	What the hell?
1775494	1778095	I mean, all the other games you're playing use the entire controller.
1778115	1783737	I think you should be familiar enough with it to all of a sudden become retarded when you start playing an Xbox Live Arcade game.
1783957	1788339	And don't tell me you're just buying the system to play those Live Arcade games because that's even more retarded.
1788899	1794301	What about the whole trying to make the system accessible to people who aren't the hardcore gamers?
1794682	1798763	Because I know quite a few people would probably think the idea of playing UNO is kind of cool.
1798963	1800384	That aren't the hardcore gamers.
1800544	1803165	Are they going to be buying a 360 to play UNO?
1803625	1809148	Please don't tell me that they're actually going to go spend $400 on a system to play UNO.
1810208	1810708	UNO!
1810968	1816851	Also, if they need something so simple, they can just go to Walmart and buy a UNO deck.
1817608	1820549	And the other thing, too, is they don't have to use the analog sticks.
1820589	1824170	That's way too complex, you know, using an analog nub on there.
1824590	1827552	You know, and most of the games anyways are about one or two buttons.
1827892	1830232	It's not like they have to remember which button they have to push.
1830493	1833414	What about in trying to justify it as a family purchase?
1833514	1834354	You know, that, you know...
1834634	1836195	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1859562	1860502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1877014	1877694	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1899820	1904643	And I can tell you this much, buying accessories for a 360, it's expensive as it is.
1904703	1906804	Each one of those controllers is about 50 bucks.
1907144	1909645	You know what, I think you should be fine with just the one controller.
1910466	1914668	Okay, again, Devil's Advocate, why then do they sell DVD remotes separately?
1915488	1917289	For like PlayStation 2, you don't need it.
1918564	1925554	Okay, well the reason why they sell those separately is sometimes those DVD remotes have features that you can't normally do, like angle change and all that stuff.
1925854	1929519	Normally you can pull up all that on the PlayStation, you just have to know your way around the menus.
1929599	1934806	Yes, you can do it through menus, but why bother doing it through menus when you have dedicated buttons for that?
1935100	1937461	That's not to say, you know... That's for the convenience of the consumer.
1937902	1939162	Yes, it is for the convenience.
1939282	1940203	But here's the thing, though.
1941163	1943325	It's still convenient to use the same buttons on there.
1943545	1945086	They have triggers and analog sticks.
1945126	1946666	I mean, how hard is it?
1946726	1948888	It's not like I can't figure out the buttons.
1949408	1950488	It's pretty simplified.
1952730	1952970	All right.
1953010	1954851	Well, we welcome your feedback on this issue.
1955231	1956632	You can always send us an email.
1956772	1958673	It's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1959213	1962175	Or we'll open up the Skype line a little later on in the program.
1962748	1973070	Well, I suppose they can, you know, save some money, you know, especially since, you know, the 360 is supposedly going to, well, the rumor is going around that it's supposed to drop in price around Christmas.
1973210	1976071	And I think that's a big bunch of crap, if you ask me.
1977731	1984533	Basically, you know, this has been going back and forth, you know, people saying, oh, yeah, it's going to drop, you know, we heard it from such and such person.
1985953	1990614	That's going to drop $100 to make it look, you know, more enticing for people, you know, not to buy the Wii and stuff.
1991446	1996493	But then, again, at the same time, you know, why do they need to drop the price when the PS3 is, you know, $600?
1997214	2001859	I don't think it's going to drop, and if I remember correctly, I think Peter Moore actually said, no, they're not dropping the price of the system.
2002680	2004443	Who's saying that the price is going to drop?
2006205	2007747	Is it just internet rumor in general?
2007767	2009589	A source close to Microsoft.
2010603	2013908	Joe Nobody, basically saying that it's going to drop.
2014749	2018094	A friend of a friend's cousin's brother's uncle's.
2018194	2022120	Yeah, who probably works in the help center and is an expert on everything.
2025492	2026292	I don't think it's going to drop.
2026392	2029113	I actually see a small price cut reasonable.
2029233	2035016	I don't think like $100, but I could see like maybe they throw in a game, like a cheapy game.
2035056	2036016	A bundle.
2036316	2039918	Yeah, or they cut it by $20, $40, maybe $50.
2040838	2042739	That seems a lot more possible, especially around the holidays.
2042759	2046140	That seems feasible, like Forza 2 and the 360.
2046280	2047520	I could see that happening.
2047560	2051022	That makes more sense because you spend the money on the game system.
2051042	2053763	You want to have something to play on Christmas morning.
2054574	2058038	There, that makes more sense than dropping the price of the system $100.
2058419	2060261	Because I don't think that's going to happen.
2061623	2064887	Going over to our chat room, Jada2006 says, I laugh.
2065688	2068071	Someone actually named Joe Nobody is listening.
2069196	2072458	I guess maybe there's somebody he knows who's actually named Joe Nobody.
2072478	2072998	Good job, Loki.
2073679	2079682	Jeremy Todd 1 says, if the Wii launches at $250, then the 360 price will drop to $250 and $350.
2080362	2083784	He seems pretty convinced that that drop would happen to be competitive with the Wii.
2084925	2087166	And then, let's see, HitStun has a question.
2087246	2089467	By the way, how much is an original Xbox now?
2089507	2089908	Is it still $199?
2092332	2092873	I don't think so.
2093033	2094314	Aren't they $179?
2094855	2095935	They're cheaper than that.
2095955	2097777	I think it's around $150, if not $99.
2098157	2099178	I know it's supposed to drop to $99.
2099378	2103302	I could see them doing that to compete with the PlayStation 2.
2103602	2106664	I will research very quickly here while we move on to some other stories.
2107765	2112649	There is something you can do with the money that you're saving on an Xbox 360 if they do drop the price.
2113410	2113750	What's that?
2113790	2114271	Buy porn?
2115452	2116753	Yeah, that too.
2116793	2117814	You can spend $25,000 on a Game Boy.
2120260	2121021	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2151471	2153413	This sushi place was crazy.
2153593	2155935	They had a couple of them that were $100,000.
2155975	2156395	You know what?
2157036	2159878	Now I know which restaurant I'm going to knock off if I'm going to go.
2159898	2163021	Wow, this restaurant carries diamonds.
2163501	2164302	I'm going there.
2165623	2168165	I wonder if you complain if you get it for free.
2168785	2171287	So basically you have this equivalent of Game Boys.
2171548	2175691	Yeah, there's a $25,000 Game Boy put out by Swiss Supply Direct.
2176452	2179194	Figures a Swiss would come up with something crazy like this.
2179294	2180215	Hey, it's my turn.
2181630	2184172	You know, we might have listeners there, jackass.
2186034	2189217	Anyway, it has a diamond set on the display screen.
2189357	2192820	It has diamond off-on buttons.
2193040	2199726	It has the original cables, extra game cartridges, a blue leather display case.
2200106	2202188	It's made out of solid 18-karat gold.
2203589	2206752	The question is, does it have a knife and a corkscrew in it as well?
2207725	2208926	I think so, you know.
2209386	2218390	But it weighs 27 ounces, it's supposed to be, you know, the price is supposed to be just, like, right on, you know, cost of material and sale.
2219030	2223332	But, um, and the thing is, is that it's not even, like, a cool Game Boy, it's like an old Game Boy.
2223352	2226974	Wait, it's not even a fucking DS or a GBA or a Micro?
2227054	2228855	No, it's a freaking Game Boy.
2228995	2229735	It's a Game Brick.
2230596	2230756	Yeah.
2230776	2232517	Why didn't they just do, like, a Game Boy Micro?
2232557	2234578	They would have spent less money on it, and then...
2235970	2236471	Outro Music
2258288	2258889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2280731	2283592	Hey guys, you should play my new game, Diamond Quest.
2283672	2285393	It's going to be on my $25,000 Swiss game wine.
2285413	2292015	You saw that they renamed that game to Diamond Quest so that she didn't look like a complete idiot.
2292235	2294896	They should rename it to Stupid Spoiled Whores Game.
2295776	2297637	Stupid Spoiled Whore the Game.
2299938	2300818	God, I hate her.
2301716	2305077	Anyway, sorry, we do that once in a while.
2305137	2309238	The four years of Orange Lounge Radio, we've actually slipped into Paris Hilton's chat a couple times.
2309299	2309839	I don't know why.
2309899	2310859	It keeps coming back to her.
2311499	2312440	It's scary.
2313000	2314300	Go way off topic here again.
2315340	2320422	I can't help it, but I've actually caught some of the third season of The Simple Life.
2321322	2323103	And that show is basically like...
2327165	2336710	If I were the husband in any one of those situations, I would be getting my ass handed to me because they get them in so much trouble and then their wives basically just rip into them.
2336770	2339591	It's like, it's like basically... Excuse me, I have a question.
2339651	2340411	Is this a video game?
2341372	2341672	Yes.
2342292	2343273	I'm getting to that.
2343833	2344113	Fine.
2344213	2345614	No, actually I'm not.
2346254	2349316	But, um... Okay, completely off topic there.
2349476	2349536	Um...
2351158	2353279	I kind of talked about something that we talked about last week.
2353859	2355379	Louisiana and their game laws.
2355419	2361941	Basically the one where they were going to be fining the hell out of retailers for selling indecent stuff.
2362021	2363901	Well, a couple things have happened.
2364061	2368863	First off, Judge has actually gotten the law temporarily blocked.
2369563	2377585	And basically, of course, this is all the ESA is doing as far as being able to
2378610	2385135	The ESEA and EMA have filed suit last Friday to overturn the law.
2385516	2397245	According to the court filings later that day, a federal judge, James J. Brady, granted the trade group's request for a temporary restraining order preventing the law from being enforced.
2398626	2404811	Basically, the three reasons why they... It's very...
2405620	2412907	Controversial and goes against a lot of the First Amendment and I think goes the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.
2413308	2422497	And basically the ESA's comment on this was, not only does the act directly restrict the decimation and receipt of considerable amounts
2423123	2424884	A fully protected expression.
2426644	2445551	But because of its numerous vague terms, the act also creates a chilling effect on a great deal of speech as video game creators, publishers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers will respond to the act's uncertainty by self-censoring, depriving both adults and children access of undeniably protected expression.
2445811	2448392	Basically what they're saying is, you know,
2449122	2450623	What exactly is obscene?
2451123	2453524	There's nothing really defining it in this.
2453745	2460588	And also, because of this, game publishers and companies will have to start self-censoring the games.
2461369	2462249	And that's never good.
2463530	2474215	So on top of that, though, the Louisiana governor has a second bill that's gone in place, which I actually kind of like this one.
2476204	2499152	basically add games to lists of media that can be harmful to minors and the ESA is actually for this one and what it's supposed to do is basically just kind of give actual guidelines to what is obscene and basically not meant for kids.
2499212	2502013	It's kind of like the same loss that the normal
2502654	2505515	and other media like TV and movies go by.
2507757	2508397	That one's pretty good.
2508837	2510398	And that one actually got signed into law.
2511118	2511819	So that's always good.
2513179	2520103	I think they did the same thing in Maryland actually with that kind of law where basically falls under the obscenity laws.
2521263	2521544	I don't know.
2522584	2530368	So is this going off the ESRB or what's going to determine... It's basically they have the guidelines.
2531689	2532249	What it is is
2532924	2541609	If the material is designed to incite or appeal to the... I hate law terminology.
2541689	2543070	It's so stupid.
2543110	2546152	But anyways, it's basically if it's obscenely offensive.
2546212	2554457	If the game is Baby Raper 2000 or something like that, that's not going to be... They'll have the right to pull that off the shelves.
2554857	2558799	I would want to try out Baby Raper 2000 before I start knocking on it, though.
2558839	2559860	It could be interesting.
2561823	2563484	Just kidding, Jesus, God.
2564085	2564645	Alright, anyway.
2565486	2574453	So, basically, it's, you know, if it's harmful to minors, and I think that they're gonna go by the ESRB's, you know, rating system for this.
2575053	2582119	I'm not sure, you know, because, to be honest, they can take laws nowadays and just spin them any way they, you know, benefits them, and
2582674	2585035	Well, I guess if the ESA isn't arguing with it, then I guess I can go for that.
2585055	2585195	Yeah.
2585215	2591298	Well, you know what I think is also pretty ridiculous, though, is that actually the Parents Television Council is actually pretty upset about the...
2611437	2613478	ESRB's commitment to parent campaign.
2627419	2627960	What?
2628160	2630061	Who's got sand in their vagina about it?
2630902	2642650	Basically, Tim Winter, who is the executive director, basically said in his press release, to quote, yet another dodge by the video game industry to avoid accountability for the harm it inflicts on children.
2645832	2652497	What they don't seem to understand is that it isn't the industry's job to protect their children.
2653037	2655119	It's the parents' job to protect their children.
2655842	2670070	by limiting another facility's free speech, they're basically passing on the responsibility that they agreed to as parents to another facility.
2670110	2676313	Now, I do agree that at a certain age, there are certain things you should not be exposed to.
2677314	2685178	However, when you have a child, you accept the responsibility of guarding your children from those things that you don't want them to see.
2686460	2692845	and this is just them not wanting to take responsibility for what they need to be doing.
2692885	2696028	They want to put the blame on somebody else instead of their own failures.
2696849	2697489	That's how I see it.
2699170	2700732	I would love to get that guy on this program.
2701372	2702973	Oh, so would I. We should send an email.
2704334	2704855	I think we should.
2705395	2705916	I'm all for it.
2705936	2707437	Why don't you work on it?
2707797	2708918	I will work on trying to get him on.
2709679	2711040	Do you like how I passed the buck there?
2712079	2712920	I'll table it for future discussion.
2727839	2729520	And you know what happens when we get pissed off?
2729540	2729781	People die.
2756892	2760133	and the FUs of the week are brought upon us.
2760153	2761453	Because I must destroy them all.
2771376	2780218	So, my FU of the week goes toward the stupid drunk girl from last night.
2780298	2785679	Basically, I took my friend Julie to Berkeley yesterday for her birthday.
2786716	2790738	Um, you know, because I wasn't going to get to hang out with her tonight for her birthday party.
2791618	2792698	And we had a good time.
2792818	2800521	I was really, really worn out and tired, you know, on the way home, so I dropped Julie off and rested for a little bit at her house so that I'd have enough energy to get home.
2801201	2812725	And as I was approaching one of the major intersections, for anybody who's in the Sacramento area or who has been here, is when you're going down White Avenue toward the interstate on-ramp
2814454	2821877	Right before Marconi, basically this girl, I was in the far left lane, there was a lane between us, and there was a girl in the far right lane ahead of me.
2822637	2825619	And she suddenly spins out of control in her little Mini Cooper.
2826639	2831621	And spun right and then swerved around left and just went into a full 360 in the middle of the road.
2832462	2833962	And was heading directly for me.
2835203	2842906	And I threw on my brakes and swerved and she did the same and we actually avoided a head-on collision by less than four inches.
2844369	2846250	So, uh, yeah, it was pretty scary.
2846330	2850492	So, uh... Did your whole life flash before your eyes and all that stuff?
2851593	2852914	I think my brain shut down.
2853034	2857356	I was so... I was tired already, you know, but I was good to get home.
2857976	2868082	This just had my adrenaline going so bad, which actually I'm supposed to avoid, you know, by my doctor's orders, but... Anyway, I pulled up ahead, I watched from my rearview mirror to see what was going on.
2868806	2874530	She turned around and started heading out, so I just decided to go home because I was too shaken up by it.
2874550	2877853	Because, I mean, I had headlights flashed in my eyes.
2877893	2878794	It was pretty scary.
2879054	2881876	I can't let this comment in chat go by, Jamie.
2881896	2883097	You've got to hear this one.
2883137	2886840	Jeremy Todd 1 says, Jamie, you have a lot of close calls in traffic.
2886920	2888761	Maybe you're actually the one that's a bad driver.
2889041	2889282	No.
2890002	2890503	Trust me.
2890683	2894586	I'm not the one who drives drunk, who spins out in the middle of the road.
2895226	2897528	I'm not the one who bumped into a couple other cars.
2899255	2903440	No, it was actually my good driving that saved my life.
2904041	2906023	Only when she's playing Mario Kart is she a bad driver.
2906043	2906944	I don't play Mario Kart.
2907325	2907705	Well, whatever.
2907745	2908747	What driving games do you play?
2908767	2909628	Do you play any driving games?
2909908	2910569	Red Racer.
2910649	2911330	Oh, Red Racer, okay.
2911350	2912712	Why do you play Mario Kart?
2912732	2913693	I don't know.
2914685	2925588	Anyway, I got up to one of the lights a few blocks up, and a guy in a Camaro who I knew was a little bit behind me in the other lane pulled up and said, hey, what happened, what happened?
2926188	2928389	And then she pulled up next to him, so he just turned and talked to her.
2928409	2929550	He's like, what were you thinking?
2929590	2930330	What was going on?
2930370	2930930	What's wrong?
2931190	2934051	She's like, I just want to go home.
2935431	2937912	I'm sorry, I just want to go home.
2938032	2940733	That's, by the way, exactly what she sounded like, I'm not joking.
2941353	2942814	And he's like, are you drunk?
2942914	2944815	And she's like, no, yeah, a little.
2945495	2951797	Just so you know, DarkSakura, Fireboma and Chad is backing you up, saying it's because she lives in California, kids.
2952477	2953277	Seriously?
2953538	2955438	People here can't drive, they really can't.
2955638	2957399	Nor can they in certain parts of Georgia.
2958146	2958846	Isn't that right, Bobby?
2958866	2960587	If he's listening.
2960607	2962968	Bobby had to leave, but he was listening.
2963428	2973471	But no, I should have stopped and got her license plate number, but honestly, I was like, I'm getting away from her, and just shot up onto the freeway and went home.
2974151	2976772	But that was seriously really scary.
2976812	2981234	It's why, you know, you've got the, oh, don't drink and drive, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2981294	2982114	Like, don't do it.
2982394	2983995	If you do, you're a fucking retard.
2985695	2987456	If you have... It takes...
2988371	2997674	For, I think, a double shot of liquor, depending on your metabolism too, by the way, but for a double shot of liquor, it takes about three hours to get it fully out of your system.
2997734	2998995	For a beer, it's about the same.
3000135	3003557	She, her eyes were so dilated, it wasn't funny.
3003677	3006378	I could see from, you know, two lanes over.
3007378	3009779	Marin in chat says, she plays Derby Owners Club.
3009799	3011500	That's kind of like driving, right guys?
3011920	3012280	Guys?
3012360	3013340	I've beaten my horse.
3014141	3014421	Alright.
3014581	3015301	But, but,
3015834	3016214	Fuck her!
3016754	3022077	And everybody who drives drunk, a big, humongous, horkin' fuck you.
3022237	3023638	I hope that you get arrested.
3023658	3024538	Alright.
3024839	3025139	Loki.
3026319	3041467	Um, I kinda have, I just, you know, her whole story reminds me of the time that I was driving, don't ask me why, to play DDR at like midnight over at, you know, CCL, you know, Country Club Lanes, the ultra ghetto bowling alley that had DDR bits up in 24 hours a day.
3041826	3042927	Anyways, that was a long time ago.
3043087	3054775	But there's this guy who was in a van who, um, swerved across all the traffic and swerved back over and went on the off-ramp, but except for making the turn for the off-ramp, just kind of jumped over the lane and kind of drove off-road for a little bit.
3055315	3055856	That was funny.
3056376	3060339	Because I was like, I'm all, man, that guy's, like, not really, you know, paying attention to where he's going.
3060359	3062020	I'm like, whoa, oh, he just went over the edge.
3062681	3063181	But that was funny.
3063561	3064402	But, um, okay.
3065082	3065663	On to our views.
3065903	3068164	Um, fuck you, stupid 24-hour fitness...
3070839	3072300	Because I went and signed up.
3072340	3081205	I mean, granted, this is how every single place is, where they have your sign-up fee or whatever, and then they have a processing fee of like $70.
3082345	3085187	What exactly are they doing for that $70?
3085267	3092851	Because I saw her process the account and basically type it into a computer for about one minute.
3093191	3095592	So that was $77 worth of work right there?
3096593	3097253	I don't think so.
3097453	3099575	And by the way, for $77, she needs to learn how to type.
3102585	3106186	My FU goes to that great big ball of fire in the sky, the sun.
3106926	3113787	I went to a theme park in the Bay Area called Great America yesterday to kind of celebrate my birthday with some friends.
3114207	3115867	And believe me, I'm not stupid.
3115887	3119188	I put sunscreen like all over, all over, you know.
3119208	3122608	There's SPF 60 because I want to make sure I wasn't going to get burned up.
3123769	3127549	However, it didn't really occur to me that, oh, Rob, you have spiky hair now.
3127929	3131370	You should probably put some sunblock on your scalp.
3132060	3140504	because basically what I ended up with is a sunburned scalp and you can see a little bit of the redness there here in studio where basically the top of my head got sunburned.
3141265	3143286	So F you to the sun for burning people.
3143346	3146027	That's not a nice thing to do to the creatures of the earth.
3147188	3149089	Magus, we'll give you one quick F you if you got one.
3150390	3155793	Alright, this is not normally something I F you but first I'm going to hear this.
3156073	3160455	F you to Blizzard in the 1.11 patch which just came out
3161087	3172314	On Tuesday, they added new content, Nexramus, that kind of stuff, revamped a lot of things, Mage and Shaman talent reviews, but they made one crucial error.
3172574	3180119	They made the Looking for Group channel global across the entire population of the server.
3181220	3187424	Wild players, if you know Goldshire, if you know Baron's Chat, it's now across the entire server.
3187464	3190286	Don't even try to use the LFG channel to LFG.
3192425	3197609	See, they had failed to take into account how utterly stupid 95% of their player base is.
3199330	3204193	I wondered why that channel was freaking off the charts in chat.
3204233	3212999	I'm like, there cannot be this many people looking for, like, you know, Ragefire Chasm and Deadmines in Silver Pine Forest.
3213059	3214680	I'm like, what the hell is wrong?
3215121	3216061	Okay, that makes sense.
3216182	3217542	Wow, that was stupid of Blizzard.
3218623	3219564	Good job, guys.
3220384	3222366	All right, wow, that was like our longest FU segment ever.
3222386	3222906	I'm sorry, guys.
3224068	3228672	All right, I wanted to say real quick before we get back into the news.
3229253	3233076	To follow up to the chat question earlier, how much does an original Xbox cost?
3233457	3234217	Here's the weird thing.
3234257	3236059	I've gone to like five different sites.
3236660	3239002	I'm not able to find a new Xbox.
3239042	3241384	Did they stop making them and I just forgot they did?
3241645	3241785	Yep.
3242325	3243646	I just, wow.
3243967	3245368	Well, I guess then here's the deal.
3245428	3248550	You can get them on GameStop.com and I imagine EB as well.
3248891	3253335	A refurb system is $99 for most of the used ones.
3253375	3254976	You can get a factory refurb for $129.99.
3255216	3261061	But it looks like if you want a new one from Microsoft themselves, tough poop.
3262802	3263563	Tough poopy.
3266726	3267106	Oh, man.
3267386	3270549	Anyways, so yeah, that kind of sucks.
3271044	3272106	Need for Speed Carbon, which, um,
3284725	3287266	Need for Speed Carbon Copy Need for Speed Carbon Copy
3314329	3316631	You will fly over the edge and die!
3344540	3347081	I love the soundtrack to that game.
3367267	3370228	I love how the commercials for that totally spoiled the after credits ending thing.
3393787	3396350	I didn't even bother to... I could care less, Loki.
3396450	3397390	I could care less about that movie.
3397971	3398692	Alright, anyway, sorry.
3399152	3416267	Well, to cleanse the palate of drifting, we actually have some confirmation by Uchiyama Daisuke, who is Namco Bandai's chief producer, stating that there will be both Tekken and Soul Calibur games being worked on...
3417697	3426679	on the... Well, they're not saying specifically what system it's going to be on, but we are going to get a new Soul Calibur, a new Tekken, and the guess is that it will be PS3.
3427139	3434781	Especially since there was already some sort of tech demo for Tekken on PS3 already.
3435061	3435461	That's right.
3435501	3438202	I soon remember something at Sony's press conference, too, about that whole thing.
3439422	3445244	And Soul Calibur 3 was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so that would seem to indicate maybe it'll continue, but...
3447089	3448371	Pantsless Pope Pantsless Pope
3463712	3465073	Soul Calibur II Soul Calibur III
3483704	3488026	Soul Calibur 2 is just much more of a big release than Soul Calibur 3.
3488387	3494190	And I'm hoping that Soul Calibur 4 can maybe live up to that bar that Soul Calibur 2 set.
3494830	3499152	It's hard to say that Soul Calibur 3 didn't live up to the bar, but in some ways it didn't.
3499312	3506896	Even though it was a great game, it wasn't a... When I look back in 15 years, I'm going to remember this next to Soul Calibur 2 type game.
3507577	3507877	I don't know.
3507977	3508917	Maybe you guys feel differently.
3509298	3509858	Do you, chat room?
3509898	3510198	I don't know.
3511679	3512019	I don't know.
3512352	3516435	I think Soul Calibur, I don't know, I think Soul Calibur 3 didn't do as well as 2.
3517135	3524220	Especially the fact when you release something on one system as opposed to 3, you're obviously going to get less sales.
3525699	3529981	And now, of course, we have the chat room is lighting up with some feedback there, which is what I was hoping here.
3530562	3533703	Jeremy Todd 1 says, Link on Soul Calibur 2 rocked my socks.
3533863	3541827	That's one reason many people are going to remember Soul Calibur 2 was the addition of Link, which seemed so random at the time, but just was awesome for the GameCube owners.
3542687	3544008	Bandit says, you know what?
3544028	3545629	Tekken is so much better than Soul Calibur.
3545949	3548590	So he's more excited about the Tekken game that's coming out on PS3.
3549411	3552292	And Dark Knight says, hey, what about the original Soul Edge game?
3552677	3552917	Castelvania
3577295	3584340	I don't think any other Castlevania game they ever released will come close to the greatness of Symphony of the Night.
3584400	3586121	Even more so than the original, for me.
3586781	3592225	So, I don't know, that's kind of how I feel about Soul Calibur, but I'm sure you guys feel differently, but we've all got opinions.
3593346	3597969	Anyway, another game that had tons and tons and tons of sequels was King's Quest.
3598049	3599570	Remember this whole game, King's Quest?
3600871	3606873	on the PC years ago, Roberta Williams, King Quest, and they had 5 and 6 for some of the first games on CD-ROM.
3607194	3617938	Well, they went back, Sierra, and they remade 1 and 2 a while ago, and they gave them fancy VGA graphics, but one game they never really went back and upgraded that much was King's Quest 3.
3619038	3627001	So what's happened is that the fans, and you remember a while back when we even had some of the King's Quest fan community on here, and they were making like the
3627361	3628763	The Fan Game in the series.
3628783	3632048	I mean, King's Quest fans are passionate about these games.
3632068	3633050	And this just goes to prove it.
3633350	3637016	King's Quest 3, to air as human, has been remade.
3637788	3654419	And this has been remade by Infamous Adventures, and this remake features all new VGA backgrounds, enhanced close-up cutscenes, dialogue portraits for all the characters, original music by a professional composer, a full speech pack, and a new point-and-click interface.
3655320	3662865	Basically, Infamous Adventures believes this game is still relevant, and no profit is being made off the game.
3663105	3665147	You can download it free of charge for...
3666789	3668310	43.2 megabytes is how big the game is.
3668370	3678653	It's at infamous-adventures.com And honestly, guys, if you don't have GameTap, because GameTap has a lot of King's Quest games in there, I would highly recommend you guys check this out.
3679814	3681914	I'm just going to assume it's like the original.
3681934	3683295	I haven't had a chance to check it out myself yet.
3683335	3683755	I want to.
3684195	3689697	I would highly recommend you download it as quick as possible because it'll probably be pulled off by some copywriter.
3689737	3693418	Well, now that one person's downloaded it, it'll forever be floating in the internet somewhere.
3694331	3696252	So, you know, check this out.
3696332	3697873	King's Quest was a great series of games.
3698794	3699974	King's Quest was pretty cool.
3700014	3704597	I just, you know, I couldn't get into it too much, but I think I want to play Peasant's Quest.
3705557	3706317	Peasant's Quest?
3706337	3707578	What?
3707878	3709619	On the Homestar Runner site.
3709799	3709979	Oh.
3710980	3713421	You know, actually, I... Damn you, Chogdor!
3713681	3720425	I think the easiest one to get into out of the series, and I don't know, King's Quest hardcore fans may disagree with me, but I think King's Quest 4...
3721971	3725213	I actually tried to start with King's Quest 5 and I couldn't get into it.
3725433	3725753	Really?
3725853	3726653	And Magus, you're saying 5.
3727133	3727353	Why?
3728614	3734376	I'm saying 5 because I got started on the series on NES and it was the first King's Quest release that I got to play.
3735657	3741579	Unfortunately, I didn't really get into it past 5, but I did get to go into the previous games a little bit.
3743440	3746021	I got to start on 5, so I think it was the easiest for me.
3747648	3750149	All right, going to the chat room for some quick feedback before we move on here.
3750329	3756290	VidPower says, I'd like to point out that while Sierra did remake KQ1, it was a total market failure.
3756670	3759511	AGD took over the reins of remaking it, and for free.
3760151	3761571	I guess that's kind of an interesting point there.
3761591	3764452	I think Sierra had a couple of their old games remade back in the day.
3765492	3766252	And then let's see.
3767492	3770713	Some folks, SexyStalker is commenting, shameless game tap plug.
3771138	3772880	They don't pay us.
3772920	3776944	We just think they do have a pretty interesting service, but it's really up to you guys if you want it or not.
3777364	3781288	And then Gamerman55 in chat says, Sky, we want some real news, not old games.
3781768	3782469	You know what, though?
3782949	3789836	Even though, yes, this is an old game, I think this speaks more volumes about what fan communities in the gaming world are capable of doing.
3789876	3794640	I mean, it is not an easy task to remake a game with graphics.
3794700	3796382	I know I sure as hell couldn't program it.
3797392	3803454	I think it is kind of noteworthy when these gaming fan communities go above the Akala fandom.
3804194	3808696	Speaking of which, there has been another remake that's kind of been a little off the radar.
3809876	3812977	A lot of FPS fans know that
3813720	3814300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3843854	3846596	You know, there's loving a game, and then there's loving a game.
3846856	3849038	I mean, these guys love their game.
3849098	3849258	Anyway.
3849278	3849698	I have release dates.
3866428	3869810	All right, so some non-fan games.
3869910	3873111	Hey, some of these are fan-ish, I guess.
3873151	3874832	These games may have fans very soon.
3875652	3883376	Actually, one of the titles surprises me, because I thought you couldn't use Ninja in a title in the UK, but I guess you can.
3884176	3886337	Coming out on the 30th, a whole crap load of games.
3886397	3888318	We have Shinobi Doei of the Ninja.
3889068	3900274	We have Over G Fighters on Xbox 360, New Super Mario Bros., Micro Machines, Flat Out 2, Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, Def Jam Fight for New York, Brick'em All.
3902335	3914721	We've also got Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Swords of Destiny, Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror, Titan Quest, Untold Legends, The Warrior Code, and also before that on the 29th is Panzer Command Operation Winter Storm on PC.
3916822	3917182	Excellent.
3917642	3918643	How about in the U.S. ?
3919392	3930835	US, not a whole lot, but if you're a Pirates of the Caribbean fan and you happen to have a portable console, then you'll be happy to know that Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest has arrived.
3932495	3934075	Actually, I played a little bit of it at E3.
3934376	3935416	It is pretty good.
3936016	3938957	It's your typical action game.
3939357	3945638	Anyways, Micro Machines, though, is coming out on PlayStation 2, Micro Machines Volume 4, as well as the PSP.
3946078	3947539	Are Micro Machines still around?
3948539	3948919	I don't know.
3950222	3951403	Magus is shaking his head no.
3951623	3952444	But the game looks fun.
3952744	3953265	I don't know.
3953365	3954966	Okay, I guess if it's fun, who cares?
3955146	3958308	Number two, Ultimate Ninja for the anime fighting fans.
3959769	3969556	Also, let's see here, Rough Trigger the Vanacore Conspiracy, which is some weird budget game where you play a werewolf.
3970977	3971438	You know what?
3971618	3978683	I believe there was one 360 game which was Over G Fighters is coming out this week, which is supposed to be kind of like Ace Combat.
3979434	3981555	But, I don't know, not a whole lot.
3983376	3984076	Not a whole lot at all.
3984176	3985297	It's a slow period for games, though.
3985337	3986877	Sudoku Gridmaster, that was the other one.
3987438	3988298	Whoopee!
3989138	3992340	If it's by Nintendo... I don't know.
3992500	3993800	I'm burned out on Sudoku.
3993840	3997022	If you own a GameCube, though, nada anything for you.
3997602	3998642	You suck.
4000723	4001864	That's what your retail says.
4003304	4004325	But anyways, you know.
4005100	4005901	We can't be all buying this.
4005921	4011405	You know, that reminds me, I still gotta buy my copy of Crusty Demons so I can come over and play it.
4012506	4018510	But one of the games I will not be buying is the 10th Anniversary Edition of Tomb Raider because I honestly hate Tomb Raider.
4018590	4024394	But, you know what, it is confirmed though, Eidos has come out and said they are remaking the very first Tomb Raider.
4024695	4028998	It's supposed to be arriving on the PlayStation 2, PSP, and PC.
4030499	4033141	No word yet when, but it's coming soon.
4033541	4034462	So, you know,
4034978	4036960	for all you fans of Tomb Raider out there.
4037040	4041964	I don't know why, but it's coming out soon.
4043526	4047769	Well, you know, one way that Tomb Raider became ultra-famous was because it had a movie made out of it.
4049351	4051653	And usually movies are made out of famous games.
4052273	4055977	But this game was a little more B-list or C-list even.
4055997	4056977	It was more of a cult game.
4057038	4057678	Clock Tower.
4057698	4058579	You remember Clock Tower?
4059019	4060761	Now, Clock Tower was kind of cool because, you know,
4061704	4064506	Gory, gory murder and the scissors and all that scary stuff.
4064886	4067548	However, what's interesting about it is that it is being made into a movie.
4068389	4072571	Jorge Oguen is heading up the Clock Tower movie project.
4073432	4078876	Basically, what's happening is that the person who wrote When a Stranger Calls is writing a script for this movie.
4079696	4084820	I believe Jason Wade Wall is the name of this guy.
4085400	4088042	And production is going to start on the Clock Tower movie this fall.
4088322	4091384	Hopefully, the movie will be better than When a Stranger Calls.
4092064	4096347	Why do people have to pick all this really non-mainstream stuff to make movies out of?
4097708	4098169	You know what?
4098769	4101151	I think it's about the source material for some people.
4101491	4106995	If a good movie can be made out of this, and I think it can, I think a real scary movie could be made from this.
4107215	4108696	I mean, it's a pretty scary game.
4108736	4110697	I've only played a little bit of Clock Tower.
4111418	4112859	I had a bunch of sequels.
4112879	4113980	Wasn't there at least a Clock Tower 3?
4114020	4115521	You were playing Clock Tower 3, weren't you?
4116001	4119364	No, it was somebody else that I knew, but I've seen the whole first part of Clock Tower 3.
4119404	4121185	No, the last time I touched Clock Tower was...
4122449	4124290	I want a Contra movie.
4126190	4129191	I want a Silent Hill sequel.
4130512	4131432	Well, you may get it.
4131692	4132872	I think they broke box office.
4132892	4133193	I don't know.
4133253	4133513	Who knows?
4134033	4134493	Who knows?
4134613	4150438	But at the very least, for the July 8th opening in Japan, they actually have a Silent Hill haunted house called Shocking House that's up from July 2nd with hours 11am to 6pm for our listeners in Japan.
4151321	4154885	And the movie, like I said, opens on July 8th.
4154905	4165458	There was actually a big press conference out where they had someone dressed up as a Red Pyramid and a bunch of nurses sort of slumped over.
4166379	4171265	And there's also, though, a nice quote from Akira Yamaoka.
4172212	4178234	The aim was to make something enjoyable even if the viewer wasn't familiar with the game.
4180974	4183075	Which actually I think did a pretty admirable job.
4183115	4185875	I'm hoping that the movie does pretty well in Japan too.
4186235	4189296	I didn't realize that the movie hadn't come out in Japan yet.
4189836	4191257	That was kind of the most surprising thing to me.
4191337	4194377	I thought they got it the same time we did so I was kind of surprised they still hadn't seen it.
4194397	4196578	It'd have to have gone through.
4196618	4200699	Because usually I think that it's like a difference of I want to say 1 to 3
4202483	4207744	I was reading about this on some various gaming blogs and I noticed the Silent Hill movie was getting a lot of crap.
4230638	4236640	I don't know why there's this sudden backlash because it seems like when the movie first came out, these same sites were like, Pyramid Head is awesome.
4236680	4239601	You know, I was a little surprised by this sudden backlash where it's cool to hate on Silent Hill.
4257523	4266412	I don't understand what the whole trend is with these movie viewers who are looking for Oscar quality acting in these movies.
4266932	4269174	First off, where are you the judge?
4269414	4272277	What is Oscar quality acting in the first place?
4273278	4278523	Two, why the hell would you go to a movie like that anyways expecting that you know it's not going to be there?
4278936	4281998	You go there because you want to see Pyramid Head slice people in half.
4282098	4284340	That's basically why you would go.
4284460	4289203	Which didn't quite happen, but you still got cool Pyramid Head killing scenes.
4289823	4290644	It's a horror movie.
4290704	4292905	Horror movies are supposed to be campy and bloody.
4293025	4294286	That's what they are.
4294967	4297528	I mean, they're not like... I don't know.
4297589	4299810	It's not Casablanca with blood.
4299890	4302232	I mean, it's just a movie.
4302892	4305114	Lots of feedback in our chatroom, and then we'll get Magus.
4305354	4306474	Actually, Magus, you want to comment first?
4306775	4307115	It's just...
4308266	4313531	People who expect a lot out of video game movies, just be grateful that it's not like Wing Commander.
4315112	4317714	VXJSnakesV says, Silent Hill was an awesome movie.
4318555	4321277	JeremyTodd1 says, you know, it's because of the hype of the movie.
4321577	4325340	When they just got back from seeing it, they were all like, OMG, that was so awesome.
4325601	4327843	Then a month or two later, yeah, that movie sucked.
4328443	4330965	SSJ100Matt says, who are you to judge?
4331205	4332687	It's not Oscar quality.
4333527	4335249	Gamerman55 says, Oscars suck.
4337114	4339840	It's not what typically gets nominated for an Oscar.
4339860	4341884	You don't really see horror movies up there too often.
4342605	4343627	I think that it was really good.
4344148	4347935	I think that the acting in it was pretty darn good, especially since they had the Borg Queen.
4349058	4349138	Oh.
4350629	4351530	She was so cool.
4351570	4356354	I think some people were kind of pissed off by the second half of the movie, which involved the Borg Queen character.
4356714	4362038	But at the same time, you know, a movie is very hard to do with, you know, one person.
4362119	4365561	I don't know if the only movie I can think of that's really pulled it off is like some of the Alien movies.
4365661	4367583	But, you know, I don't know.
4368384	4369625	I wasn't mad by the movie.
4369645	4370245	I thought it was great.
4370405	4370626	Anyway.
4371746	4372047	I don't know.
4372067	4372667	Could have been worse.
4373368	4374028	Exactly.
4374048	4375930	You know, all these people being critical on stuff.
4376450	4379092	One person, though, that was critical on things would be...
4380214	4380894	Rich Kiyanka of
4409331	4411093	SomethingAwful.com and goes by Lotax.
4411653	4416797	He actually wrote Uebol to see if he could be able to fight him.
4417798	4427086	Now, interesting note, he has not, as of writing that letter, he had not written anything bad about Uebol's movies, but Uebol said, yeah, sure, go ahead.
4427526	4436013	So, he decided to go ahead and officially write a review for House of the Dead, which, or Alone in the Dark, I should say.
4436093	4438115	House of the Dead one's coming later, and
4440163	4443527	Yeah, it's just basically a really bad movie.
4443827	4449653	But it's interesting to see though that he kind of bent the rules to be able to fight this guy.
4450514	4452736	So that is one person that he will be fighting.
4453797	4455079	So maybe I can do it.
4455419	4461185	More people probably read somethingawful.com than actually went and saw Blood Rain, so you know...
4461878	4464843	Oyebol probably has something to win from this
4477558	4479319	I kind of want to see Postal now.
4479879	4483360	I kind of want to see it just because you can't really mess up Postal.
4483380	4484420	There's no plot to it.
4484520	4485841	It's just basically violence.
4486161	4489622	It's got Gary Coleman in it, which, that's awesome right there.
4489822	4493223	And it's going to have a boxing match with Uwe Boll and a bunch of movie critics at the end.
4493683	4495324	I mean, that sounds cool.
4495604	4496464	I think it could work.
4496964	4501345	You know, more people are probably interested in seeing Lotex get his ass beat.
4501445	4504786	And before I say that, I'm not slamming something awful.
4504906	4506427	I am not a goon yet.
4507082	4511725	But there are people out on the internet who would love to see Lotex get his ass beat, especially by Uwe Boll.
4512046	4513927	See, I think this is what Uwe Boll needs to do.
4514007	4520452	He needs to get out of the video game movie thing and just start making mindlessly violent or cheesy campy movies.
4520752	4525295	Because he's got the kind of thing down with, you know, Alone in the Dark and stuff.
4525616	4527397	Just make your own source material.
4527437	4532000	That way people can't say, oh, you know, he based it on... It's not even near the game or something like that.
4532341	4533141	That's what he needs to do.
4533161	4535463	Because he doesn't understand how to make...
4536429	4543274	Good movies, so make crappy movies that have a lot of B actors in it and just go crazy with that.
4543394	4549159	Snakes on a Plane is a perfect example of something you can do to that effect, but just go crazy with it.
4550059	4553762	Some of the best movies out there are movies that don't make sense, like Giant Crickets Attacking Earth.
4554002	4556584	That doesn't make any sense, but they're good to watch.
4559266	4561748	GK128 seems to back up what you're saying, Loki.
4561788	4564630	He says, Postal will be awful, but at least we'll expect it.
4565751	4566112	Exactly.
4568198	4569842	Guy gets angry, goes kill things.
4570022	4572649	I mean, that's pretty simple to me.
4572750	4573131	I don't know.
4573610	4576511	I don't know, it worked for, what was that movie?
4578491	4579492	Shoot, now I can't remember.
4579512	4580072	Falling Down?
4580112	4580652	Falling Down.
4582652	4583953	Falling Down was a good movie.
4584853	4587534	If he makes it like Falling Down, then I'll go see it.
4587834	4601197	Honestly though, if Uwe Boll's Postal was playing next door to another fucking Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock movie, I would rather, if forced to gunpoint, go see the Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock movie than that.
4602401	4609825	So how fast does the lake house have to be traveling before it explodes?
4611706	4612747	I think we need a break now.
4613747	4615148	Yes, please.
4615208	4616709	Let's cleanse the palate.
4616969	4622272	So we'll be back very shortly with more of episode 188 of Orange Lounge Radio.
4622392	4623392	Our fourth birthday.
