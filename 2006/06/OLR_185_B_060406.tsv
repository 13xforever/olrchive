71553	71913	DarkSakura
90337	90657	and so on.
112529	114510	Look at my ugly face while I play Uno.
114570	116331	I mean, what?
116351	116951	There's nothing to it.
116971	121373	You're talking about one of the people testing the camera right now, and what they did is they put it on their dog.
121673	129317	See their dog panting, just going, I think that's great, because, I mean, I don't know.
130478	131458	They had something like this.
131478	133979	They had the iToy chat, but it's a game.
134019	136000	You had to buy it, and that was lame.
136441	138762	I think they should have totally done this before a lot of stuff just...
140310	143971	What I want to know, how many games of Strip Uno are we going to see?
144011	151933	Because that's really the only practical use of this peripheral that I can think of is Strip Uno.
152153	152953	Voice chatting.
154673	155514	Does it do voice chatting?
155854	159314	Yeah, you can use voice chat and you can do video chat and stuff.
159435	165836	Well, that might be kind of cool because you might hear when a draw for a wild gets played on something, you'll hear, fuck you!
166116	169700	People can actually do, imagine if you will, over live.
171061	173444	You could have video phone sex.
174125	178149	And if you ever wanted to show your naughty bits to strangers, here you go.
178689	180191	But please, 18 and over only.
181292	185857	How are they going to stop slutty 17-year-olds from doing this?
186538	187258	I don't want to see that.
187338	188139	That's, you know...
189332	193815	I don't know how they're going to try to stop them, but that's still going to make for more interesting games.
193895	194055	I know!
194075	195156	It's like, ah, I'm quitting.
195336	196417	I guess they'll get warned.
196637	199218	I guess they figure the community will police itself.
199619	204282	It's like, you know, they're going to use the peripheral to be able to map your face on characters.
204622	208344	Like, say, for example, playing multiplayer Rainbow Six Vegas or whatever.
208704	210285	Oh, look, he has a penis for a head.
210325	211206	That's interesting.
211246	211846	Exactly.
213007	215569	How many boobs are you going to be playing against, literally?
216803	219805	Go into the chat room over at OrangeLinesRadio.com and click on chat.
220085	223347	Guinness Goblin says, we strip Uno, fat naked gamers.
228391	232033	Amplitude1 says, strip Monopoly, I think, over in the chat room there.
233234	236096	Well, they are coming out with poker later, so we'll see.
236816	237136	All right.
239654	243236	Also, that's not the only peripheral that's coming out for the Xbox 360.
243296	251180	There's apparently a mole within the Microsoft organization that has some news on other things that are coming out, and this all makes sense.
251880	256142	New faceplates with Halo, Forza 2, and Viva Pinata are going to be on their way out.
256582	259604	A wireless headset is coming out, but as far as I know...
260164	268151	I was listening to another podcast, I want to say it was All Games Interactive, where they bought Scott for his birthday a headset that was wireless.
268291	273496	So this must be the official Microsoft headset that's coming out, but you can already get a non-official one.
273536	278740	They have some pretty cool looking ones that are out right now, but the new wireless one is kind of nifty looking.
278800	279100	It's like...
279781	280702	I don't really know how to describe it.
298883	300964	A wireless gaming receiver is coming out too for $20.
301264	303184	Does that mean like a router?
303624	308325	No, that receiver is actually for your PC.
308386	309606	It's going to plug into the USB.
309626	312326	It's so you can use your wireless controllers and peripherals with your PC.
313107	314167	Oh, that's kind of neat.
314267	315627	I like that.
315667	319628	And a 256MB memory unit for those of you that are actually using memory units.
320148	320629	All three of you.
320729	322389	Just spend the extra money and buy a hard drive.
322489	322769	Seriously.
322789	322929	Loki!
326894	329361	Some controversy in the Xbox 360 community, yes?
329562	334756	Yes, Peter Moore said something retarded Basically, gamers don't care about backwards compatibility
336443	342266	and, you know, he says, nobody is concerned about backwards compatibility.
343007	347109	We under-promised and over-delivered on that, which, if I remember correctly, no they didn't.
348550	351311	And it's a very complicated thing, very complex work.
351371	354633	I'm just stunned that we have hundreds of games that are backwards compatible.
355293	360696	He also added, more are coming, but at some point you just go, there's enough, let's move on.
361383	365666	or people aren't as worried about game being backwards compatible.
366547	374093	And I like to think that we've upheld our end of the bargain in making at least two or maybe three hundred games backwards compatible.
374313	384321	No, actually, I believe you said you were going to make them all backwards compatible, so that would not be upholding your end of the bargain there at all.
385542	387423	And you know what?
387830	388951	That's your problem for doing that.
405303	414233	and I, you know what, PlayStation 3, here's one good thing at least I can say about PlayStation 3, if it truly is backwards compatible with all PlayStation 2 and 1 games, that's a huge bonus.
414634	420240	And now, what about the people now that say, why do you buy a new console to play all your old games on?
420300	422462	What would be a response to people that are saying that?
423323	449038	um well for example when you have one game coming out in the month and you may not want that game you know what it's nice to be able to buy some older games also drives more game sales because now there's more games you can play instead of you know maybe the 30 or 40 that are out right now you can go and play 300 and for those that may have limited shelf space too exactly and also you bought a new system you know maybe you sold your xbox maybe it took you know a
450249	460792	and just, like, basically, you know, failed on you and now you have a new system and you want to be able... Or, for example, you know, what they should have done since, you know, the PlayStation 2 is backwards compatible with all the PlayStation 1 titles.
461312	473535	Say, for example, you have an Xbox game that comes out and you want to play it, you know, and that might not be on the 360, like, say, for example, The Godfather because the 360 version hasn't come out yet and maybe you want to play that game.
473655	476455	Oh, well, you can't because it's not backwards compatible.
478056	478376	I don't know.
478716	478736	I...
480210	485814	Granted, there is a point where you just have to say forget it, but I don't know.
485854	492318	Unless they make a portable system that plays the old Xbox games or something like that, you never know.
492558	500163	Moving on, on a related note, there is a backwards compatibility update coming in the next couple weeks to Xbox Live.
501905	504686	This was announced on the Gamerscore blog.
504947	508629	Somebody from the Microsoft team said that there is a backwards compatibility update coming out
508976	510872	within the next few weeks, quote unquote.
510892	511819	But at the same time,
512236	518439	I seem to recall hearing that that download things in the background patch was coming out last week and that didn't happen.
518839	522901	So I would imagine it's possible that the backwards compatibility thing will be pushed back.
523601	525682	No word on what games are going to be backwards compatible.
526182	526822	So we don't know.
527763	528243	No, it's really sad.
528263	530204	Don't know if you're going to get your beach volleyball yet.
531064	534406	Well, that's the thing that's really sad is all these updates have come out.
534466	537247	We had one that added most of the Tom Clancy games.
537547	539268	We had another one that added three other games.
540424	541992	What happened to updates every month?
542716	543178	What the hell?
543339	543601	I mean...
544514	545134	That's pretty sad.
545234	554218	I feel sorry for the backwards compatibility team because it feels like we're picking on them a little bit, but probably they're just under, like, they probably got under-budgeted or whatever.
554258	557579	They're probably working their butts off, but they just don't have the resources to do it.
557599	558439	It's not their fault.
558499	563061	I'm just saying, you know, don't promise that you're going to have updates every month.
563121	566423	Don't promise that you're going to have all the games backwards compatible if you're not going to do it.
566443	570884	Say we're going to support the major titles, you know, and that's it.
570964	572365	More and more will be coming, you know,
573067	573908	as the year progresses.
574428	581533	That's what you need to do instead of saying, yeah, all the games are going to be backwards compatible because basically you're lying.
581853	588298	Say if I went out to buy a car right now and they promised me that that car is going to fly eventually.
589138	591540	Well, that's a blatant lie.
591980	602548	Granted, technology may come out that may allow my car to fly one of these days, but if that's not something that you're currently working on doing or have no plans on doing, then don't fucking promise it.
604557	605097	Simple as that.
605658	605958	All right.
609720	612981	Moving on, Loki has some further news from Microsoft.
613161	613742	Well, kind of.
613762	615062	This is more a rumor department.
615483	618184	But this is a rumor that keeps coming up in regards to Microsoft, isn't it?
618204	619305	Yeah, we talked about it a while back.
619825	623547	I don't remember what podcast it was on.
623607	633392	But anyways, basically there's a group, the Diffusion group, that's saying that Microsoft is planning on launching a portable game system
634048	635269	in the market in 2008.
637349	639831	And basically they're giving the 360s some time to pick up steam.
641711	643332	Possibly, I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.
643532	655217	I mean, because that's a market that, you know, granted Nintendo's doing pretty good in, Sony's doing okay in, but they're not really, I mean, it's not anything that's, you know, totally dominating the market.
655237	657999	They don't have any, you know, must-have games.
658039	663401	People aren't going out there and just dying to get a PSP because of X game on their
664897	666337	So, sure, why not?
667398	667678	I don't know.
668099	668679	Now, wait a minute.
669099	671120	I know what show it was on that you talked about this before.
671140	676103	It was right before E3 because you brought some story in from a business magazine saying X-Player or something.
676504	677144	What happened with that?
677384	678785	That's what I think they were talking about.
678805	679486	It's the same thing.
679526	685529	It's some team that they had working on that developed the 360 or something that was working on this.
686250	692894	And I wish I had that magazine, but I threw it out a while ago, so we'd have to dig through the podcast to find exactly what I said.
693034	693174	But
694485	695906	That's basically it, yeah.
695946	697007	They're working on something.
697027	701991	If anything, you'll probably see it at E3 either next year or the year after that.
702591	703111	Interesting.
703352	705013	Be a very interesting move by Microsoft.
705073	706854	All right, let's get away from Microsoft for a little bit.
706894	710637	Well, actually, this is a game that you can play on the 360, among other systems.
711037	714040	DarkSakura has a little bit of news on Final Fantasy XI.
714640	714860	Yes?
715140	715401	Yep.
715821	717442	We all like our chocobos, right?
718043	718303	Mm-hmm.
718443	719103	They're tasty.
719664	720004	Stop it.
720244	721545	They go good with honey sauce.
722146	723987	Oh, okay, okay, okay, fine.
724924	727767	Um, Squeenix is talking about raising your birds.
728187	728407	Yep.
729428	734312	Um, on the official site, um, they basically were comparing, uh, Chocobo raising to gardening.
734752	739476	Something that would require, uh, a little bit of your time for, uh, one to three months.
739936	741618	You begin by finding an egg.
742318	744100	Actually, that sort of makes me think of Ragnarok.
744120	751586	You know, you find your egg, and then you have to... But this, in this way, though, you care for your egg by spending, you know...
752113	754935	By helping it hatch, you use certain items to help it.
755876	763263	And then you feed it, and you spend time with it, and you raise your baby chocobo, and you name your chocobo.
764103	771530	And apparently you'll just be able to do all kinds of stuff with your chocobo that I'm not at liberty to discuss because it sounds kind of strange.
773071	775333	But you can apparently breed your chocobos with your friend's chocobos.
775353	776614	You don't sleep with it, do you?
776634	777635	Because that's really gross.
777655	777755	No.
778135	782642	Imagine, like, living in your mog house and you're talking about going, Mommy!
782682	783203	Work, work!
783283	783663	Work, work!
783804	784865	Yeah.
784925	787269	But it should be coming up on the next update.
788041	788341	Interesting.
788601	790281	Now, I believe I was reading something about it.
790321	791502	You have to check it every day.
791662	791902	Yeah.
792362	794122	So, this is just a way to suck you into the game.
794642	795002	Yep.
795042	796483	Play me every day.
796703	798343	Addict, addict, addict, addict.
798363	799083	Get something cute.
799343	805925	Although, I did also read something that there will be a way where you can get, like, if you're going on vacation or whatever, somebody can babysit your chugabow.
805945	806325	Chugabow sitter.
806525	807485	Yeah, like a chugabow sitter.
807545	808585	They should have the chugabow kennel.
808665	809646	But it costs money.
809906	811146	Like on, remember on...
812603	812943	Oh, Nintendogs.
812963	813304	What was it?
813344	813904	Neopets.
814505	814625	Oh.
815125	819069	How you could, you know, if your animals were all dying, you could just like, you know, put them in the kennel.
820730	821531	We're all fed.
821991	822872	You don't have to take care of them.
822952	824333	Well, I also think of Nintendogs.
824454	827256	You could put your dogs that you didn't want anymore, you could take them to the kennel.
827696	827957	Yeah.
828677	829638	Or they could be put down.
830159	830759	That's the pound.
830779	832761	They'll put them down if you leave them there for too long.
834763	836144	That's a scene in... Mine all ran away.
836304	838426	That's a scene in Nintendogs that we needed.
840453	843035	and Ten Dogs where your puppy gets rabies.
844075	845616	Gotta put him down, son.
847077	849019	Alright, Paul, let me do it!
850660	854162	Moving on, Loki, you have some news about another very popular RPG.
854422	859745	Yeah, Oblivion's getting yet another add-on, which is excellent.
860946	863488	The new add-on is basically...
864198	875406	A quest that revolves around finding a powerful mage who has set off in search of the Daedric artifact Mephroon's Razor.
875907	879349	And basically the Razor has the ability to instantly kill enemies.
880250	884413	And the mage intends to use it to overthrow the Empire.
884453	889337	And it's up to you to make sure that you find it first so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
890838	893580	Basically this download is going to be the most expensive download yet.
894313	897594	Coming in at $2.99 for the PC users.
898675	903257	And no price yet on the Xbox Live Marketplace, but it's assumed to be about the same.
904897	912420	And it's supposed to give you a massive, massive dungeon to be able to go through.
912800	916302	As well as adding 17 new magic items and a ton of new books.
918082	921964	And also, might add though, if you do happen to find the item, you get to keep it.
922284	922524	So...
923601	924662	It's a death to everybody!
926544	931829	Alright, going to another very popular, this one an MMO, World of Warcraft.
931889	937595	I don't actually have a lot of news about the actual game itself, but there is a trading card game that's coming out.
937635	940418	They're going to do a card game, it's actually Upper Deck that's doing it.
940438	942240	They're doing a game based on World of Warcraft.
942580	946404	Well, the cool thing about doing the card game is that now, since the video game's been out a little while...
946744	949146	The Gabe of Penny Arcade did the artwork
971755	980422	And actually, I know this doesn't make for very good radio, but I can show you guys here in studio, and I'll post this in chat, a picture of what the card looks like.
981263	989690	And if you look at the card, you can actually see it looks like the warrior, he's got the big sword, and he's foaming at the mouth, like ready to go into battle.
989710	993533	Because if you know the story of Leroy Jenkins, it kind of fits, so that's pretty funny.
994234	994354	Okay.
996581	997222	DarkSakura
1012367	1014929	in such an amazingly fantastic way.
1014990	1019894	Yes, we love being interactive, and one of the ways we get you guys to participate in our program is we welcome your emails.
1019954	1021696	And you can email us on just about anything.
1022176	1025579	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
1025960	1033026	And once a week, Jamie puts on her hazmat suit and dives in the mailbag and pulls out some of her favorites that hopefully do not have anthrax in them.
1034267	1035328	Let's hope not this time.
1035589	1036670	I don't need any more disease.
1041314	1042635	Alright, who emailed us this week?
1042735	1045836	First one is MacMan from DreamStationCC.
1046557	1047297	I know what's coming.
1047517	1048658	Yep, Loki!
1049558	1051379	Apple runs Microsoft on their computers.
1051459	1054461	We all have Microsoft programs on our Macs, even your goddamn games.
1055341	1062505	Oh, and for only print media thing, iLife, iMovie, iDVD, iTunes, GarageBand, and iPhoto, where is your god now?
1064238	1073861	Designed by Macman, I who have superb taste in computers, unlike Loki Okay, so they have programs to do the same things that PCs do, but they're not better than PCs Can't we all just get along?
1073881	1087505	I mean, seriously, this fucking debate's been going on for like six months It's done Hey, it's alright, it's okay, I understand that, okay, maybe Macs don't have as many games It doesn't matter, Mac users don't like games, so that's fine
1088658	1089898	I'm getting a Mac and I like games.
1089958	1091419	Look, I don't even want it.
1091439	1092719	But the magazine said.
1092999	1094759	The magazine is a lying.
1094799	1097380	Buy and use whatever makes you happy.
1097660	1098040	There you go.
1098080	1098660	It's your money.
1098680	1099020	Exactly.
1099040	1100061	Spend it on whatever you want.
1100101	1100561	Linux on a toaster.
1100581	1101661	Exactly, that is the point.
1101721	1104382	And I bought an iBook and I love it.
1104482	1106902	And Loki, you can just, if you don't like that, you can kiss my butt.
1106942	1110623	I want a MacBook with a docking station and a new monitor instead of an iMac.
1110923	1111663	I should have waited.
1111703	1112543	There's better ones coming out.
1112563	1112883	But anyway.
1112943	1113764	MacBook is hot.
1113964	1114284	I know.
1114344	1115464	Let's keep it moving.
1115704	1115944	Okay.
1116882	1118743	Guy message from David.
1119803	1121664	I found this thing on Google Video by accident.
1121684	1126785	It's a video of a group of people who put together a play of the first level of the original Mario Brothers.
1126825	1130326	The music was a little off-timing at some parts, but I thought it was pretty funny.
1130706	1133647	It'd also be pretty awesome if you guys could do a Flash website for the PSP.
1134608	1135248	I'm working on it.
1136448	1139309	I think the problem with Flash on the PSP right now is it's slow.
1139329	1140209	It's only Flash 2.0.
1140369	1143410	Yeah, it's slow, so... Which I don't really know.
1143970	1145031	I started working with Flash 8, so...
1146172	1149333	Urge Sony to get their Flash a little better and then we'll look into it.
1149353	1154935	I planned on playing with it, but honestly I don't know too much about the older versions of Flash to make it work right now.
1154955	1163197	We'll also do a Wii website when it comes out because they have Opera and it supports Opera 9, which is the newest Opera browser right now.
1163457	1166879	Make sure you'll get E3 on Wii!
1168239	1168639	We'll see.
1169219	1172840	Yeah, E3 and PSP, I don't know if I'll want to do that next year.
1173120	1173941	We'll see, we'll see.
1175699	1177460	We also got one from Robway.
1178140	1180241	This is Cue the 8-Bit Sound Effects.
1181102	1185084	He linked me a story that's talking about, and this is on Wired News.
1186235	1187696	Strap Up and Jump Like Mario.
1188936	1197801	The Nintendo Amusement Park is by the same group of New York University students who did the Pac-Manhattan.
1198582	1201363	Well, actually it was in the same big games class.
1201383	1207766	Yeah, Pac-Manhattan was a recreation of Pac-Man using the streets of New York with Central Park being the ghost area.
1209682	1219992	But now they're doing an amusement park where you strap yourselves in and basically you jump through a recreation of the first level of Super Mario Brothers with hooks and everything.
1220232	1222354	Because Mario can jump four times the normal...
1223311	1223651	DarkSakura.com
1250419	1251980	So it actually looks like it's pretty good.
1252040	1255943	They're talking about how to basically do video game physics in real life.
1256563	1258265	And I thought it was a pretty cool application.
1259826	1261647	It's a little silly, but whatever.
1261827	1264069	We can all get a little silly sometimes.
1264089	1270033	I think it's a pretty fun idea, unlike the thing that they said was going to be at E3 next year, which wasn't quite as cool.
1271574	1278259	So, to the next email, I got one, another one from, actually no, that's the same one.
1279798	1281459	Got one from Spoon.
1281479	1285622	As opposed to Fork.
1286482	1287643	It's three O's.
1287663	1288924	Okay, Spoon.
1289884	1292646	Hi, I've been listening to your podcast for about four months and it's good stuff.
1292706	1297749	Good to hear the different takes and the fact one of you, he shall remain unnamed, hates Max so much.
1298370	1298630	Loki.
1299851	1301072	He's supposed to be unnamed.
1301652	1302613	I named him, so ha.
1303641	1305442	Max and Nintendo go hand in hand.
1306342	1309084	Build a machine that can do what it's set out for correctly.
1309124	1310605	Nintendo equals gameplay.
1310705	1311545	Max equals work.
1313026	1316287	I wanted to share with you another... Loki, just bite your tongue.
1316748	1316968	Bite it.
1316988	1319889	He actually linked us to another podcast that talks about DDR.
1319909	1321170	It's called AskANinja.com.
1322236	1323357	Oh, I've heard of Ask a Ninja.
1323517	1324397	They're really popular.
1324937	1326358	I think they're a video cast, actually.
1326998	1328239	They are, and it's awesome.
1328739	1330040	I didn't see the DDR episode.
1330120	1332861	Oh, I haven't seen that either, but I don't know.
1333181	1341205	I always said that if there was ever a new video game channel, they would have to put them in as a segment.
1342826	1344467	How much does it cost to start a TV channel?
1344487	1345127	We should start one.
1346005	1346825	Hello there, Orange Launch Radio.
1346845	1349566	How are you doing on this fine Friday afternoon?
1349586	1350327	Hot two days late.
1368271	1369872	I'm doing just fine, thank you.
1370052	1374673	I sent you this message to ask if you three would honor me on your input on Luminous Mobile.
1375133	1377214	I have the game and I absolutely am in love with it.
1377654	1385716	Many fans out there do not even know of this game's existence, which makes me sad.
1385736	1390878	This is also a chance for many out there who do not own a PSP to finally experience the genius of this game.
1390898	1394479	Thank you for taking the time to read this and keep kicking ass.
1394719	1398961	Those of you that listen to the show know I am not a big fan of mobile gaming, but I am a huge fan of Luminous.
1399041	1399582	I'll check it out.
1399662	1401123	I don't know if my carrier offers it, though.
1401163	1407146	I have Sprint, who's kind of like the black sheep of the cell phone carrier, so I don't even know if they have Luminous, but I'll check it out if it's out there.
1407166	1410348	I didn't even know my game can play games.
1410508	1413149	Yeah, there's a little dyslexia there.
1413489	1414430	I don't know if my phone can...
1414770	1419815	I imagine it can, but I haven't tried because God knows how expensive that would be.
1419835	1421096	I'll check during our next break.
1421736	1424939	I saw a review on it, and the guy that reviewed it said he liked it.
1425500	1426921	I mean, it looked very similar.
1427141	1430804	The only thing they didn't like is that the music's not like MP3.
1430884	1434448	It can't be, yeah.
1434708	1438131	It's MIDI, and yeah, it's not very MIDI-tastic.
1439859	1440239	All righty.
1440339	1441400	I got one more email.
1441480	1444582	Actually, I got this to my own box, Jamie at OrangeDollsRadio.com.
1444762	1445222	Okay.
1445602	1456568	And I'm just going to paraphrase this a little bit, but it's from a guy named Chris, who is a contributor to WeebleStuff.com, who was our website of the week last week.
1456588	1457969	I was going to say, that was two weeks ago, right?
1457989	1458829	Two weeks ago, yeah.
1459009	1460090	That's your website of the week, yeah.
1460130	1460330	Yep.
1460630	1461591	Wow, so somebody heard it.
1462011	1465753	Apparently, he listens to our podcast, is a big fan.
1465793	1466754	In fact, he says on here...
1468087	1475048	that since it seems none of the other guys on the staff listens to OLR to their great detriment, of course, I felt I should say a big thanks for giving us a plug.
1475068	1480770	I've been a fan of OLR for a long time now, and I've got to say you guys are consistently among the best independent gaming podcasts.
1481210	1485031	I appreciate that you bothered to mention UK, European games news and release dates.
1485551	1490412	I sometimes suspect you guys are the only American games media outlet who are even aware of this little continent's existence.
1492552	1493073	Well, we tried.
1493373	1494533	I had replied back, though.
1495754	1496854	I'm actually not reading my own email.
1496894	1511781	But, I mean, basically, I don't think that it's... With a lot of the content now coming out of, you know, US and, you know, a bit out of Japan, you know, at least for the more niche market, you know, I really think that the rest of the world sort of gets overlooked.
1511821	1512921	I mean, gamers are everywhere.
1513481	1518744	We got our person from Serbia who emailed us.
1518784	1519664	I thought it was great.
1520983	1528605	I want to make sure that because we have listeners everywhere that it's not just United States.
1528785	1529486	It's everywhere.
1529526	1530446	We have listeners in Canada.
1530486	1531286	We have listeners in Japan.
1531326	1532426	We have listeners in China.
1532827	1533347	I found that out.
1534047	1537748	We have listeners all over Europe, UK.
1538188	1543069	We want to make sure that you're a gamer too.
1543389	1545650	We want your voice heard just as well.
1545970	1547050	We want to get you the news.
1547611	1549291	If it's happening in your area of the world,
1549921	1551381	If we don't know about it, let us know.
1551641	1552201	We'll mention it.
1554702	1557402	I know one of our listeners started a Frapper map a while back.
1557562	1560163	We want to see where you guys are, so please take a minute to stop by.
1560223	1568424	It's frappr.com and then just search for Orange Lounge and put a pin on the map so we can see where our listeners are because that's kind of cool.
1568544	1570885	It's just kind of neat knowing where all you guys are.
1570985	1572285	Even if you're in the U.S.
1572325	1573185	because it maps that too.
1573425	1576526	I would really like for our listeners...
1577762	1583346	I'd like to have a thread on our forums at orangeoddsradio.com Go to the forums link on the left side of the page.
1584027	1584847	Let us know where you're from.
1584887	1585908	Let us know where you're listening from.
1587029	1590671	It'd be really cool just to put names.
1591052	1593714	We don't want to think of just statistics.
1594674	1597796	Because all we see are numbers when we look at our stat pages.
1598137	1601879	We want to know who you are, why you listen to us.
1602660	1604441	I love hearing from our listeners everywhere.
1604601	1605562	I think it's fantastic.
1606823	1607123	All right.
1607544	1608484	Did you say that was the last one?
1608964	1609705	That was the last one.
1609765	1612387	I saved the last one for last.
1612547	1612827	All right.
1613608	1614368	That's the way to do it.
1614708	1615028	All right.
1615089	1616089	Send us emails.
1616149	1617690	Mailbag at OrangeLondrina.com.
1617730	1621473	You can ask us whatever, and as long as it's clean, we'll answer it during the show.
1621513	1622914	Thanks a lot, those of you guys that email us.
1622934	1624035	And if it's dirty, I'll save it.
1624495	1624795	All right.
1625295	1625916	She'll bookmark it.
1626596	1630279	Loki, back into some news, some more Sony antics.
1631039	1636703	I swear to God, in the last few days, if this guy David Reeves, you know,
1637727	1646531	I'm not hating on Sony, but he's the one that's saying it.
1647272	1649353	Basically, his quote is this.
1650693	1651173	Market share?
1651373	1652014	Not that important.
1652934	1653815	Who needs market share?
1654475	1654655	You know?
1657424	1659225	The name of the game is not market share.
1659305	1661127	It's how fast we can grow the industry.
1661367	1666031	Our ambition is to grow 15% a year on hardware and software.
1666071	1671355	If we can, we want to try and double digital entertainment in the next 5 to 6 years.
1671796	1676099	Whether we have 40, 50, or 60% of the market share, it's not that important.
1677640	1683665	Well, here's a little thing to kind of be scared about what he said here.
1683846	1684226	They want to
1684588	1686869	Double the digital entertainment world.
1712369	1712889	XBOX or NINTENDO
1742089	1744130	I don't know, I find the whole story just a little odd.
1745191	1746812	It's just an odd thing to say.
1747253	1758782	Well, this is the same guy, he was saying that, you know, who cares, gamers will just have to pay more for their system because you'll buy whatever it is, even if the system didn't come out with games, you'll buy it because it's Sony.
1759182	1761244	I mean, this is the same jackass that said that.
1761384	1765907	I mean, what they need to do is shut him up because he's saying really stupid stuff.
1765927	1766808	All right.
1768002	1770044	Moving on to more Sony-related news.
1770064	1772845	There's a new controller coming out for the PlayStation 2 and PC.
1773346	1774406	It's a tilt controller.
1774467	1778429	It's the E-Dimensional G-Pad Pro Gyroscopic Game Pad.
1778809	1782452	And it has tilt-sensing technology, and it's the same thing that the PlayStation 3 has.
1782492	1784333	It's coming out for the PC and the PlayStation 2.
1786014	1789436	And by the way, though, it also has rumble.
1790477	1796021	Now, Sony's not putting this out, but didn't Sony say that they can't do rumble in the tilt thing because it'll mess it up?
1797112	1797753	PC, PlayStation 2
1816485	1817826	I don't know so much about PS2.
1817846	1819106	That's kind of weird.
1838749	1841991	DarkSakura, we had a letter in the mailbag about a mobile game.
1842011	1844213	You have some news that kind of affects another one?
1844773	1845473	I sure do.
1846114	1859743	Dirge of Cerberus for mobile is actually called Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode, which is one of the Final Fantasy VII titles coming out, and it's going to be on Amped Mobile for three months starting in the summer.
1862025	1864686	Actually, there's no word on if it's going to be out for the UK,
1869169	1872571	You know I played through Final Fantasy 7 and I never even got Vincent?
1889577	1890258	What a loss.
1890338	1893400	I actually got him without using an FAQ or anything.
1893420	1904450	Well, you know, on Final Fantasy, because I played Final Fantasy VII when it first came out, you know, as you guys, I'm an older gamer, so there wasn't really the whole GameFAQs.com didn't really exist then.
1904470	1907833	I found him by accident and just randomly asked the right questions.
1908734	1910275	I also got Yuffie right the first time.
1910295	1910856	Wait, no, no, no.
1910896	1913478	Yuffie's the one he asked the questions to.
1913738	1914439	Vincent was the safe.
1914759	1917682	Vincent, you still had to do... Oh.
1917702	1918482	See, I never did the save.
1918703	1919944	You have to answer the right thing.
1920404	1921465	See, I never figured out the save.
1921945	1924368	But I got both Yuffie and Vincent.
1924648	1924968	That's funny.
1924988	1926690	Yuffie I figured out just through trial and error.
1926970	1927811	She showed up once in the forest.
1927831	1928851	And she keeps stealing your crap.
1929012	1933475	Yeah, and I kept running around that same forest until she finally joined my damn party.
1933495	1936999	But I somehow or the other managed to ask the right questions the first time.
1938760	1939441	All right, Loki.
1940638	1943620	Have some news about the way items are packaged.
1944461	1945682	I hate this.
1946542	1947022	Just read it.
1947303	1948664	Blister packaging.
1949104	1949844	You gotta love it.
1950345	1964334	Basically, if you don't know what that is, if you've ever seen anything, especially nowadays, any game peripheral or anything out there, it's that hard packaging that is goddamn impossible to open without killing yourself.
1964534	1969218	I mean, I know for a fact trying to open the Xbox 360 accessories and stuff, I...
1970218	1971339	That stuff's like glass.
1971540	1972981	It's really scary.
1973401	1980107	But actually, it's funny because Wired News did a little article here called Tales from Packaging Hell.
1980728	1989716	And basically, the whole thing behind the packaging is that it's meant to avoid, obviously, theft.
1990236	1993699	But a lot of people have really gotten hurt by this.
1993939	1996562	And they have some pictures, actually, of people with...
1997413	2001937	Major gashes on their hands and people being sent to the hospital.
2003819	2008423	This one guy, George from Atlanta, sliced his hand open and there was a
2013393	2014133	Thanks for watching!
2031512	2038035	And when it takes me like 10 minutes, just the... I nearly... I really... You can't use scissors, because scissors aren't sharp enough to get through this.
2038395	2039696	So you have to use a knife.
2039716	2040796	You have to stab it in there.
2040896	2050040	And the knife... The knife, most of the time, unless it's relatively dull, or if it's not as sharp as it can be, it'll slip, and it'll cut yourself the knife.
2050380	2057843	Then if you manage to do get it open, the edges are really sharp and jaggedy, and it's just... It's like cutting open glass.
2057923	2058604	And basically...
2060336	2060916	DarkSakura.com
2091786	2093006	The FUs of the Week time.
2093106	2094507	DarkSakura, start us off.
2095487	2107670	My FU of the Week goes toward... It's a number of people who have... It's actually a misconception I'm going to put my FU of the Week toward.
2108170	2121413	Like I've said at the beginning of the last segment, I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, which is why I was really sick with what I call the plague in November and December, and have been consistently not feeling well.
2122191	2127736	Um, there's people who say, oh, well, you'll be just fine when you get back from your medical leave.
2128236	2129477	Um, no.
2129877	2131098	That's not how it works.
2132079	2145390	Um, it's just, it's something that a lot of people think is either an all-in-your-head sort of thing, you know, or something that you can just fix with a drug, or something that if you just sleep a lot, you'll get over it.
2145450	2149493	But the whole thing about it is that no matter how much sleep you get, you still feel tired.
2149963	2151204	You feel like you haven't slept.
2152664	2159788	You go through phases of being really hungry and then not being hungry at all and nothing will ever make you feel satisfied if you're in one of those phases.
2160489	2163730	You feel like your muscles hurt all the time.
2164731	2168733	And for anyone who thinks that it's just an all-in-your-head type of thing, fuck you, okay?
2169433	2171854	You know, it's a fully diagnosed thing.
2171895	2175937	It's something that they have to rule out physical practice before they diagnose you with it.
2176357	2178298	But taking a nap doesn't help.
2179015	2187260	I've been sleeping for upwards of 10 hours a day while I've been on my medical leave, and it still hasn't helped hardly any.
2187760	2192042	I get to learn how to give myself shots on Wednesday, though, which is not fun.
2192863	2202588	But yeah, so for anyone who thinks that it's an all-in-your-head sort of thing and that a little rest or some vitamins will help you get over it, it may help, but it's not the cure.
2202848	2207611	So stop telling me that I'll feel better when my leave is up, because I don't think I will.
2208385	2209326	All right, Loki.
2209726	2210427	A couple things.
2211168	2221477	First off, fuck you to Christopher for the smell that's coming from his desk, and I'm going to guess it's from these three empty McFlurry containers, which are probably rotting right now.
2222158	2226522	That's a really nasty, like, rotten milk smell that's... Ugh.
2226922	2228444	Anyways, so fuck you to that.
2228464	2232988	Fuck you to the stupid people that are in my apartment complex who are parking their car in the middle of...
2233530	2236192	And then finally, um... I don't know, I'm just... Fuck you and me being hungry...
2261007	2267309	Oh, and, uh, fucking needles, because every time I get poked with a needle by a doctor, I almost pass out.
2268189	2272750	You know, it's not necessarily medication or something, but my body, like, goes into shock whenever I have a needle.
2274571	2275891	So, uh, yeah, that sucks.
2276892	2277212	Alright.
2277992	2278572	Uh, my F.U.
2278592	2282433	goes to this humongous zit that's on my face right now that won't go away, no matter what I put on it.
2283254	2285234	Because it makes me feel really ugly and sad.
2285274	2286154	No matter what I put on it part.
2286174	2286214	Uh...
2288598	2296481	because it makes me feel ugly and sad and makes me not want to be social because I feel ugly.
2297702	2299983	But it'll go away, and then I'll be pretty again.
2301203	2303764	All right, anyway, let's move on to another story.
2306865	2308346	Loki, it's all you.
2308966	2315489	Yes, I'm wondering if this shouldn't have been before the FU's, but anyways, higher prices for...
2317485	2320767	PlayStation 3 and Wii are confirmed by Atari.
2321287	2324990	And actually Atari is the distributor for Sega in some parts of Europe.
2325050	2327291	So it's basically some of the Sega games.
2327351	2334636	Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3 for example is going to cost 67.99 euros.
2335297	2340500	While some other games like World Snooker Championship 2007 will be 73.99 euros.
2345895	2355621	and basically on the Wii, Sonic, Wildfire and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz will both be available for 59.99 euros.
2356181	2359623	And it's a lot more than what we got to pay for them.
2359963	2360263	Sorry.
2362245	2362885	Damn, Texas.
2363265	2365206	All right.
2365286	2368468	Microsoft made a pretty interesting statement this week.
2368548	2369729	It was Chris Lewis.
2370433	2376534	Works for Microsoft was speaking about Sony's online service saying, I'm flattered that they followed our clear direction.
2377274	2378715	Plagiarism is a good thing.
2378795	2380495	That in itself isn't such a problem.
2380815	2381795	It's what the market wants.
2382015	2384356	But we've known that's what the market wanted all along.
2385796	2388337	So that, by the way, was in an interview with Eurogamer.
2388977	2393098	So Microsoft kind of taking a swing there that PlayStation 3 is just downright copying them.
2394198	2394618	Interesting.
2396218	2400059	But again, you kind of expect that you're going to get copied in some elements, but whatever.
2401166	2403892	Loki, you have some news about Wii web browsing.
2404252	2408922	Yes, Opera, of course, as everybody knows, is going to be the web browser on the Wii.
2409343	2410486	And they've actually...
2411671	2416153	Release some information of what this is going to support and some of the details on it.
2416474	2427419	First off, Opera will be embedded on the Wii's Flash ROM, unlike the DS version, which is actually a cart-based operating system.
2428079	2435403	The browser may take advantage of some of the gesture-based navigation and interaction that's available with the Wii controller.
2435882	2437743	That would be kind of interesting.
2438663	2440945	No advertisements will be included within the browser.
2440985	2446828	However, you shouldn't rule out that there won't be in-game advertising delivered via Opera.
2448148	2449229	But I think it's pretty interesting.
2449249	2461916	Another thing that someone was bringing up about the Dreamcast browser is that they had special features for when you're programming webpages, you can actually make the Dreamcast VMU rumble or display things.
2461996	2464097	I think that would be really cool if they added that kind of
2464642	2472728	to the Wii browser where you can make the controller rumble or special tags or something to use the Wii controller.
2472748	2474590	I don't know, something to think about.
2475350	2476191	That's a little weird.
2476251	2484297	And it's also basically going to be compatible with Opera 9, which is the one that's out currently right now.
2485398	2489582	So it is supposed to support most everything, including Java, so...
2490728	2492890	DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
2514534	2518519	Actually, yeah, there's going to be game rentals in Japan.
2519580	2520962	It actually started on the 3rd.
2522303	2531794	Basically, Koei will put out its first rent-a-net video store at the Taito Game Center in Kanagawa.
2532915	2534277	Basically, it's not
2535663	2540824	There's not any real rental franchises like we have here, not like Blockbuster or anything.
2540864	2542825	So this is a very, very new thing there.
2543785	2549006	New games will basically rent for 2,800 yen, which is 2,450 over here for five days.
2550666	2553127	And then you bring them back.
2553147	2555567	$24, that's expensive.
2556147	2557728	Everything is more expensive in Japan.
2559228	2559368	Right.
2560590	2563392	I just wanted to say real quick, I had to correct something I said earlier.
2563592	2568515	Funnydale actually in the chat room corrected me on something I said about GameFAQs wasn't around when Final Fantasy VII.
2568896	2570036	It actually started in 1995.
2571157	2573719	So they actually were around, it's just not a lot of people knew about them, including me.
2574559	2576981	But certainly they weren't the site they are now then.
2577181	2577922	It's been a long time.
2579184	2581525	I actually used them for Super Nintendo stuff back in the day.
2581545	2582186	That's crazy.
2582306	2589210	I used eBay when they first came out, but back when they were... Well, not back when they were Pez dispensers, but just after that, before they got all commercialized.
2589250	2591671	I bought Super Metroid on eBay, like, in 97.
2592992	2593993	So, anyway.
2594793	2597695	Websites were different back then, because browsers weren't the same.
2597775	2602478	Anyway, one more story here, guys, and we're going to go to our Skype line over at orangelaunchradio.com.
2602498	2603478	Click on Interact With Us.
2603598	2604599	Loki, what's up?
2604619	2607641	Yes, a British... What was it?
2607661	2607781	Yeah.
2608624	2620976	The SCI, some British publication, was saying that they're going to be extending Eidos' licenses for Hitman and Tomb Raider to the gambling franchises, including online.
2624579	2629604	You're basically going to see some video slot machines based on both Lara Croft and Agent 47.
2630044	2633788	I guess that's interesting.
2634926	2639627	You should know, though, that they're still going to steal your money just as well as all the other video slot machines out there.
2643088	2646408	Unfortunately, no boobies in the slot machines either.
2647689	2647869	Sorry.
2648609	2649029	Alright.
2650529	2650889	I don't know.
2651249	2655250	I can't get too excited about slot machines because I personally hate those video slot machines.
2655590	2658491	I think that they're a big waste of money, especially the nickel ones.
2659091	2661791	You have to put more nickels in.
2662432	2663332	That's all.
2663472	2664212	Instead of quarters.
2664915	2666655	You know, more of the same, whatever.
2694522	2695203	Hi, who's this?
2695803	2696764	This is Nintendo Maniac 64.
2697584	2698625	Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.
2699266	2700687	You're a little quiet, but what's on your mind?
2701588	2704029	Oh, well, it's probably because I'm actually using my regular phone.
2704049	2705971	I don't know, my mic jack died on my laptop.
2706451	2706912	That's weird.
2706952	2708473	Well, get out your thoughts anyway.
2709093	2711015	Okay, anyway, I have an announcement to make.
2711275	2714157	Let me see if I can load up my test.
2714197	2714838	Okay, here we go.
2715038	2718501	From June 7th to 10th, I'm going to be in New York City.
2718521	2723685	Since we're getting an art award for this art show season, um,
2724338	2730740	I'll be at the Nintendo World Store on Friday at 11 a.m.
2731260	2734741	So if you're not there, come visit me if you want.
2735362	2738043	I'll be wearing that pancake button.
2738723	2740083	I'll be wearing a shirt with that.
2741204	2742904	I have a topic here on the forum.
2743424	2748086	More details, I'll get you a small link for it.
2748106	2748766	xrl.us
2760300	2763701	I think I heard about half of that because of the connection we have here.
2764302	2765002	Let me get this right.
2765042	2769904	You said you're going to be at the Nintendo store on Friday and you want to meet other listeners of the show or something?
2770684	2772765	Sure, at like 11 a.m.
2772985	2773246	At 11 a.m.
2773306	2774646	And what are you going to be wearing?
2775427	2776407	I'm going to be wearing...
2777292	2779914	a shirt with the pancake bunny on it.
2779974	2780574	Oh, Oolong.
2780694	2782075	Oolong, the pancake bunny.
2782195	2782675	Okay, yeah.
2782695	2783015	Poor dead bunny.
2783055	2784136	Dude, that guy rocks.
2784236	2791820	And the URL, just in case if somebody missed it, it's xrl.us slash mz5k.
2792540	2792860	All right.
2793401	2797783	I'm glad you could use this program to help make yourself more friends in person.
2797823	2798623	Have fun at the store.
2799304	2799564	Okay.
2799804	2800084	All right.
2800104	2801325	Okay, I'll take you at the store.
2801485	2803286	All right, I'm letting you go now because your connection sucks.
2803786	2804086	All right.
2804126	2804906	All right, take care, buddy.
2805747	2805907	See ya.
2808024	2809266	Alright, so much for that.
2810107	2811369	I want to go meet listeners.
2812651	2813672	We did that last week.
2813792	2814593	Yeah, we did.
2814694	2815895	We did meet a few listeners last week.
2815915	2816336	That was cool.
2817117	2819400	If you want to call us, it's OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2819420	2821323	Click on Interact With Us over on Skype.
2821463	2824027	It's username OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
2824600	2830466	Or again on the telephone, it's 916-226-9067 Let's go to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
2831247	2833409	Good evening, it's DMN, how are you?
2833689	2836732	Good, oh, your connection's much better than the last guy What's on your mind, DMN?
2837433	2844540	Well, as you announced earlier, I had that little contest of exclusive Zelda questions That's right, did you get a winner?
2845362	2845642	I did.
2845962	2847082	T23M is the winner.
2848303	2850123	That's 23Megas.
2850583	2853123	He should be disqualified because he comes on the show once.
2853183	2853843	No, I'm kidding.
2853903	2854424	Let him have it.
2857224	2857784	He's a local.
2858824	2872407	But yeah, going back to jumping release dates, I've heard that Nintendo's practices generally they give those offending retailers shipments late or very low shipments later on.
2873387	2873867	So I don't...
2875758	2879140	Do you think Nintendo is going to give a company like Target a big spanking?
2880560	2890624	I think so because I remember Microsoft released Project Gotham 2, I believe it was, a couple of days early and they got beat down for it.
2890724	2896846	I recall that they got Halo 2, a very low shipment of Halo 2, I think a half shipment of Halo 2 in each store.
2899567	2899867	Wow.
2900427	2902028	So, I think
2902785	2906727	I think Target's going to be in big trouble for releasing the DS Lite early.
2908127	2922314	But on the other side, hey, you know, we can get some DS Lites that are already out there, and word of mouth I'm sure travels, and it kind of created a sudden surge of interest a little bit on the blogs while people frantically hunted these down, so I don't think the news is all bad for Nintendo here.
2922774	2923534	Oh no, not at all.
2924095	2926916	I can actually tell you firsthand, the DS Lite is awesome.
2928099	2935401	I want to say the guy that we invited who called in.
2935701	2938082	That was Silent Wind.
2938142	2938902	That's right.
2938922	2939562	He had one.
2939622	2942143	I think he brought it to show us.
2942183	2944723	I'm looking at mine right now.
2944743	2945544	It looks pretty nice.
2946244	2946944	Rub it in.
2949352	2950252	All right.
2950292	2955775	Now, did you go to a Target to get it, or do you get it from a special, like you work for Nintendo, your special thing?
2955855	2958396	I actually got mine from an import store.
2958656	2960457	Nintendo just got theirs in.
2960617	2961397	Gotcha.
2961477	2961817	Okay.
2963438	2963778	All right.
2963818	2965219	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
2966319	2966559	Nope.
2966599	2967340	Take care, guys.
2967380	2969380	Thanks, everybody, for participating in the contest.
2969400	2970541	Hopefully, there will be more in the future.
2970841	2971161	All right.
2971201	2971661	Sounds good.
2971701	2972862	Thanks for the fun, DMN.
2972882	2973362	Appreciate it.
2973842	2974423	Take care, guys.
2974463	2974703	Later.
2975223	2975443	Bye-bye.
2975956	2977437	See, chat's a whole experience.
2977497	2984403	Even if we sometimes, you know, get so caught up in our own conversation we forget to read chat room, there's all types of fun stuff they're doing in chat.
2984763	2988787	And it's been, you know, like over 50 people every show in chat room, so it's been very nice.
2988847	2992210	We really appreciate you guys heading on over to chat and checking us out there.
2992770	2995712	We have time to take a couple more calls if anyone else wants to call in.
2995893	3000857	OrangeLawnTrader.com, click on Interact With Us, or head on over to your telephone and dial 916-226-
3002711	3003492	Thank you for watching!
3024582	3026403	Just waiting to see here if we get any more phone calls.
3026743	3028844	If not, we'll just go ahead and wrap things up for tonight.
3029344	3031385	Does anybody have any last-minute stories they want to share?
3031545	3033846	Loki or DarkSakura, any last-minute stories for our listeners?
3034626	3044731	I was just going to talk really quickly about Forza 2 because there are some updates on IGN about it, including that it's going to be built using a completely new 360 engine.
3045191	3046912	This is a Forza 1 in HD.
3047332	3049113	Nice little slap at Sony there.
3049973	3054095	Forza 2 is going to run at 60 frames per second with reflection mapping on all the cars.
3054591	3056232	running at 60 frames per second as well.
3056672	3059173	It's going to support the new wireless racing wheel.
3059813	3077582	It'll feature 60 tracks, 18 environments, 13 real-world licensed circuits, and will feature over 300 cars from more than 50 of the world's leading manufacturers, including Ferrari, Porsche, Nissan, VW, GM, and Lamborghini, to name a few.
3078222	3080463	And Forza will allow people to
3081961	3099847	to a new degree of stylization, including alternative engines, suspension kits, bolt-on superchargers, brakes, rims, racing slicks, and work on advanced suspension settings, tire pressure, and gear ratios.
3100127	3102848	So it sounds like Gran Turismo to the extreme.
3103248	3103608	Seriously.
3103968	3104208	All right.
3104728	3106289	Anybody else have any other last-minute stories?
3107129	3107369	All right.
3107847	3108427	HappyHardcore.com
3131516	3153100	Featuring Lisa Abbott, Desire the Comet Remix And also on Universe, The Acolyte with Treble Basin Attitude Which is going to be a Eurotrans song And Treble Basin Attitude is actually the one that's on the official trailer for Universe So, kind of neat
3157877	3159438	Don't tell me you flew over there just to play Supernova.
3182771	3189513	Nah, I'd barely seen Supernova where I was at in Spain, and through parts of Paris and Milan and Rome.
3189973	3192113	That's right, wait, you're of Spanish descent, right?
3192834	3195914	I'm Peruvian, actually, but we do have family in Spain.
3196114	3196474	My bad.
3198575	3202736	I thought I remember on a previous episode you saying something about that, but whoa-ho, what is wrong with your connection?
3202776	3203016	Stop.
3204916	3206877	You got some weird thing going on there with your mic.
3207057	3207397	Fix it.
3208797	3209358	Oh, yeah.
3209538	3209918	Okay.
3210258	3210698	What's on your mic?
3211761	3220864	Now, for some reason, you said that Supernova was supposed to come out last mid-May, which was a couple of weeks before it actually made the trip out.
3221144	3221324	Yep.
3221844	3226885	Came back, it doesn't seem to me that nothing has appeared.
3227966	3231447	By now, if it did come out like Konami said they would...
3232708	3239933	I would see... I would see... about, you know, about all the songs from each part of the country.
3240313	3241254	Okay, here it is, here it is.
3241554	3242955	It probably got pushed back.
3243135	3244396	Is anyone really surprised?
3245657	3247038	Games get pushed back all the time.
3248079	3250661	So, wouldn't it be prudent to just make that correction?
3251693	3256498	To just say that, you know, it might have been released last May or because of what I'm hearing.
3256999	3262845	With arcade games, it's usually not the same thing as console because you are not the one that purchases an arcade game.
3262885	3263946	The arcade owners do.
3264347	3266269	So to come on the fan side, I don't know.
3266890	3271314	It's a little different when we're talking about console games, I think, versus arcade games.
3272255	3273537	Yeah, I guess, yeah.
3275097	3276318	Just to keep that in mind.
3277019	3278580	I understand where you're coming from.
3278600	3282223	Sephiroth1215 is yelling out it's mid-June now, so I guess we'll see.
3283044	3285846	Yeah, that's what it was saying.
3286667	3287307	Let me see.
3288268	3291470	So far, did I miss anything in the past two weeks?
3292131	3293212	Any gaming news?
3294362	3300407	We took some video of the Ultramix stuff and Universe stuff at E3, and it's on YouTube if you search for OLR.
3301168	3304710	And, I don't know, go listen to our old podcast.
3304850	3308173	Check it out at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, and you'll get caught up on all your gaming news.
3308773	3309034	Yeah.
3309054	3309754	Did you like that plug?
3310735	3311055	Yeah.
3311836	3320102	One more thing, stuff in Europe is... Even DDR games, you know, here is about above 30...
3322435	3323595	All right, Zach, I'm hanging up on you.
3323615	3324176	You're breaking up.
3324216	3325496	I'm sorry to hear it was so expensive.
3326516	3327997	Hope you had fun, though, you lucky bastard.
3328017	3328777	At least you get to travel.
3329617	3329917	Yeah.
3330358	3330758	All righty.
3332498	3335519	He said everything's more expensive over there is kind of what I picked up from that.
3335979	3338740	I forgot we have a voicemail I have to play, too, so we'll play that in a moment.
3338780	3340461	But let's do some more calls here real quick.
3340481	3341661	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3341681	3342101	Who's this?
3342922	3343502	Hey, what's up, man?
3343522	3344142	This is Bandit.
3344482	3345162	Hello, Bandit.
3345182	3345722	What's on your mind?
3346323	3349944	Hey, that last guy that was just talking about the supernova?
3350144	3350284	Yep.
3351421	3357625	Well, I called Betson Air Prizes last week, and they actually told me it's shipping the last two weeks of June.
3358085	3359326	You went right to the horse's mouth.
3360166	3371573	Yeah, I actually called the number that was on Konami's website, and they forwarded me to a guy who handles the machines in the Pittsburgh area.
3371893	3374935	Now, do you work for an arcade, or are you just a crazed fan?
3375915	3376856	No, I'm not a crazed fan.
3377662	3379643	Maybe a little bit, but you know what I used to?
3379663	3380623	Sorry, a hardcore fan.
3380643	3387707	I was the owner of the local arcade, and he went ahead and gave me that information.
3388887	3389528	Well, cool.
3389948	3391128	I guess it's good to know.
3391188	3392829	So, hey, it'll be out just in time for my birthday.
3393650	3394970	Oh, yeah, definitely.
3395250	3397351	Speaking of which, chat room, what are you getting me for my birthday?
3397411	3400093	It's June 26th, and I do accept cash.
3400133	3400873	I'll take chocolate, too.
3401833	3402594	Jamie's shaking my hand.
3402614	3403394	Give me your present now.
3403414	3403794	Oh, there you go.
3403814	3404035	Thanks.
3404155	3404735	I appreciate that.
3405255	3405555	All right.
3406055	3407036	Anything else on your mind, Bandit?
3408012	3408972	Uh, no, that's all for now, man.
3432541	3438716	No, but I think it's hot, but I don't like iPod White.
3440019	3440840	Oh, you don't like the color?
3441533	3442174	Yeah, I hate it
3468374	3471136	and then take it into EB Games and say it broke.
3471196	3471836	I want a new one.
3472336	3474457	And voila, you get your new one in a new color.
3474978	3478199	Hey, that's what I did with my PSP and that's what I'm probably going to do with this.
3479240	3479880	You guys.
3481821	3485823	I shouldn't be endorsing such scamming, but I don't know.
3486283	3493247	I kind of get irritated that I always get asked no matter what store I go into about those damn replacement plans, so maybe they'll get rid of them.
3494227	3494548	All right.
3494628	3496549	You remember you were talking about the Minnesota thing?
3496769	3496989	Uh-huh.
3497867	3499608	Alright, if you're 18, it's $50.
3500489	3501950	If you're 16, it's $75.
3503551	3506753	Wow, that's a really big slap on the wrist.
3507654	3511637	But then again, what 16-year-old has $75 that they didn't get from mom or dad?
3512037	3516240	And also, if you're 18 years old, there's no games you can't play.
3517080	3517601	That's true.
3518241	3519822	But you could be buying the games for somebody else.
3520863	3521383	I guess.
3521523	3522164	Yeah, that's weird.
3523565	3533007	As far as the 16-year-old goes, if it was my 16-year-old that did that and got the $75 fine and expecting me to pay it as the parent, I'd be all, you better start learning how to say you like fries with that.
3534008	3537328	That's how you're going to pay it off.
3537348	3538328	Anything else, Ravenstolphin?
3539169	3542129	Yeah, have you ever landed that plane in Top Gun?
3544230	3545710	Oh, God, back on the NES?
3546150	3548151	Refueling it was a pain in the ass enough.
3548211	3549891	I don't even remember trying to land it.
3552023	3552743	Internet Relay Service
3581530	3589752	CA 8617 with a message from Connie E. Chla, Orange Lounge Radio.
3589812	3592573	This is Nintendo Maniac 64.
3593573	3599834	I'm using an online program that allows you to call people using the Internet, no long-distance charge.
3600515	3607656	You type a message in and hit the GA button, and your message will be read by a randomly selected talker.
3608176	3610537	You can first test it out by calling yourself.
3611109	3614601	You can check this out at SprintIP.com.
3615102	3618253	Have fun and avoid any giant enemy crabs.
3621212	3622773	GA, that's like for a teletype writer.
3622933	3623754	Yeah, basically.
3624334	3630919	I just thought it was cool that he just got some random, you know, poor older lady there to have to tell us to avoid giant enemy crabs.
3630959	3631919	That was all kinds of cool.
3632480	3637583	Now, guys, don't start sending us a barrage of messages doing this, okay?
3637623	3638764	The first time is cool.
3639104	3641366	The second and third and fourth and fifth times will be annoying.
3641426	3644428	So don't get these poor people to say all these random things.
3644688	3650832	I do not want any voicemails left on the line with, you know, hi, we're calling from the teletype service, Ridge Racer.
3651572	3655215	Okay, I will come to your house and beat you up if you do that.
3656256	3659598	I'll have them call you back and yell obscenities at you.
3663981	3667243	WonderDog Harold in our chatroom says the internet relay lady was hot sounding.
3670866	3672347	DarkSakura just made a face.
3673888	3675009	That was wrong.
3676470	3677951	But funny, and that's the important part.
3678051	3678451	It's funny.
3678691	3679752	In a very wrong way.
3680763	3682925	It's only funny until someone gets hurt, then it's hilarious.
3684966	3688929	Speaking of hilarious... When you get it on tape, it's ludicrous.
3689069	3690230	I have one more story for you guys.
3691491	3695774	Do you remember back in the day... This actually has nothing to do with video games, but it does have to do with games.
3696694	3699156	And that does make it a very important story.
3699416	3703159	Do you guys remember those books when we were kids, the Choose Your Own Adventure books?
3703479	3704179	Oh, yeah!
3704379	3705580	You know those were first published in 1979?
3705620	3705700	Yeah.
3707978	3708539	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3725922	3727143	That's how you do the 50 books.
3727843	3728703	But anyway, get this.
3729984	3731184	Choose your own adventure.
3731584	3732385	They're coming back.
3732645	3740548	This summer, eight of the original titles will return to bookstores and they're going to be revamped with 21st century references like cell phones.
3741742	3742343	That's the news.
3742383	3743243	That's all there is to say.
3744044	3745084	You do this, you're dead.
3745424	3746305	You do this, you're dead.
3746425	3747966	It's a whole new generation to enjoy.
3748806	3751868	After reading the book 50 million times, you actually find the one that you live through.
3751908	3754970	You're driving down a street and your cell phone rings.
3755330	3756991	Answer it or not.
3757332	3757952	Answer it, you're dead.
3758032	3760133	Answer it, you crashed into a car.
3760554	3761074	You're dead.
3761977	3762537	Don't answer it.
3762577	3765218	Someone else on their cell phone crashed into you.
3765638	3766478	You're dead.
3766578	3768499	You are standing in front of a white house.
3768579	3769759	There is a mailbox here.
3770199	3770919	Turn to page seven.
3770939	3772160	You have been eaten by a grue.
3775060	3776601	If you get that reference, I love you.
3776621	3778521	We should do Orange Lounge, the Choose Your Own Adventure.
3778601	3778861	I know.
3779282	3782342	Well, we had Illusion wrote a game.
3782382	3784023	We have the game, but we need our own Choose Your Own Adventure book.
3784043	3785223	We need a Choose Your Own Adventure book.
3785883	3786924	We could do that on a webpage.
3787584	3788244	That's a good idea.
3788797	3790238	DarkSakura needs food badly.
3815503	3820146	we'll see you guys next week with more Orange Lounge Radio we appreciate you guys tuning in have a great week see you next time
