00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
George, lounge, radio.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Wonky.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, June 4th, 2006.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
DS lights hit the street a bit early.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Could gaming be shown at the next Olympics?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
And more add-ons are announced for RPGs like Final Fantasy XI and Oblivion.

00:26.000 --> 00:37.120
Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.200
This is episode number 185 for this June the 4th of 2006.

00:42.200 --> 00:47.280
We're here to talk about video games and gaming and the gaming culture and all the gaming

00:47.280 --> 00:49.320
news you guys really want to know about.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.320
And I'm here to help you do that.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.320
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.640
You might know me as Sky and she's here to help you too.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.180
Her name is Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie Sommers.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.140
I help those who help themselves.

01:00.140 --> 01:02.100
You help people who want to be helped.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.100
Yes.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.100
Alright.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.100
How are you recovering from Fonomé?

01:05.100 --> 01:06.660
We did a live show there last week.

01:06.660 --> 01:14.460
I've slept a lot, because I'm actually on medical leave for two weeks, so I've been

01:14.460 --> 01:16.280
doing a lot of sleeping.

01:16.280 --> 01:21.040
For those folks that have shown concern in the past through emails and stuff that you've

01:21.040 --> 01:25.500
You've kind of been getting a lot of sickness in the past six months on the show.

01:25.500 --> 01:30.540
To not go into it in too much detail, all of the random illnesses that I've had have

01:30.540 --> 01:36.820
all stemmed from one thing, which is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which for those who think

01:36.820 --> 01:42.020
that taking an app will help you get over it, screw you, because it doesn't.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.380
It's a cumulative issue.

01:44.380 --> 01:49.380
It's something that just takes nutrition, time, eventually it goes away.

01:49.380 --> 01:50.700
Some people have it their whole lives.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.980
Some people are bedridden for years with it.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.000
I'm just really tired.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.900
I was actually reading in Wikipedia about this because when you were talking to me about

01:57.900 --> 02:02.060
this on AOL, you actually linked me to something in Wikipedia on it and it turns out you have

02:02.060 --> 02:03.900
something in common with Cher.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.420
Oh, joy.

02:05.420 --> 02:09.000
If I could turn back time.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.900
You don't have an affinity towards hay or anything like that.

02:11.900 --> 02:12.900
I wouldn't be like a horse.

02:12.900 --> 02:17.260
Oh, that must be the one and only Loki because here come the jokes from Tech Master Loki.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.340
Cher is like, you know what?

02:20.340 --> 02:23.980
Everyone wondered what happened to Mr. Ed. Cher is what happened to Mr. Ed.

02:23.980 --> 02:28.540
They're the same person! Same person! My mother loves Cher.

02:28.540 --> 02:31.420
It's kind of scary. I actually went to a Cher concert and I know you want to make all

02:31.420 --> 02:33.740
those jokes about, you know, because I'm gay, I must love Cher.

02:33.740 --> 02:36.900
She's okay, but my mom loves her.

02:36.900 --> 02:42.220
Oh my gosh, loves her. But she's made out of porcelain and ceramic and acrylic.

02:42.220 --> 02:46.820
Now wait, we're not Cher talk, so back to games for a minute. In FonamiCon last

02:46.820 --> 02:47.100
week,

02:47.100 --> 02:50.060
you somebody actually brought you chocolate right yes one of

02:50.060 --> 02:53.740
one of our listeners brought me chocolate and i'm very very very grateful

02:53.740 --> 02:57.100
and it got all over the bottom of my purse so i had to uh

02:57.100 --> 03:02.540
wash my purse only a couple pieces got out all the rest of it were in my tummy

03:02.540 --> 03:06.300
i did share a couple of pieces because i'm nice there's no way

03:06.300 --> 03:10.540
you didn't share it with me i would have if you'd hung around maybe rob's gotta

03:10.540 --> 03:13.100
go boom i did yeah i did the total diva thing

03:13.100 --> 03:18.700
at Famicon. I flew it, I see ya! When I say fly in, I mean, you know, drove up and parked,

03:18.700 --> 03:23.500
I parked on the street next to the convention center just a little ways away, and uh, you know,

03:23.500 --> 03:27.420
just walked in, did the show, and kind of left. And that's, you know, I did kind of look around

03:27.420 --> 03:33.500
the first day, I saw what there was to do, but unfortunately I don't follow anime a whole lot,

03:33.500 --> 03:40.300
myself personally, so I didn't get it. I went nuts in the dealer's room Sunday. Yeah. I bought Dan

03:40.300 --> 03:47.780
a Famicom controller-looking pencil box, and I bought him an Ice Climber cell phone strap

03:47.780 --> 03:50.080
with the... it's all digitized.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.660
They do have some video game stuff around there.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.660
I noticed there's a lot of Kingdom Hearts.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.100
I bought myself a Slime plushie.

03:54.100 --> 03:58.260
A lot of Kingdom Hearts, a lot of Final Fantasy, a lot of Squeenix love.

03:58.260 --> 03:59.580
And I bought a doll.

03:59.580 --> 04:03.220
Red Octane had a booth that's about the size of this desk.

04:03.220 --> 04:04.220
Of a computer desk.

04:04.220 --> 04:05.220
A normal computer desk.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.740
Yeah, Red Octane wasn't really showing much, were they?

04:07.740 --> 04:11.740
They had Guitar Hero and they were selling controllers and that's it.

04:11.740 --> 04:15.740
But in the groove of Absint, which is kind of weird.

04:15.740 --> 04:19.740
They were selling the

04:19.740 --> 04:23.740
DDR pads, but that's about it. They were just selling stuff.

04:23.740 --> 04:27.740
They were a vendor. They weren't trying to show off new games or anything.

04:27.740 --> 04:31.740
Here's our crap buy it. You know, that type of thing.

04:31.740 --> 04:35.740
I'll tell you what was impressive though was Yes Japan, they have Japanese lessons, but they also

04:35.740 --> 04:40.300
a label that are bringing out a lot of Japanese artists in the United States, and one of them

04:40.300 --> 04:44.140
is Guitarvator, who did a lot of the music in Jessup Radio.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.140
Oh cool!

04:45.140 --> 04:49.900
Guitarvator wasn't there this year, although their guitarist made it out, or one of their

04:49.900 --> 04:54.540
people made it out, and was doing some stuff with a couple of the other bands there, but

04:54.540 --> 05:00.600
I didn't get to see it, I think it was actually, I think it was like near our panel or something

05:00.600 --> 05:07.960
around our panel, so I didn't actually get to see this, but I did get to talk with them

05:07.960 --> 05:14.240
and you know, who knows, you guys might hear something, some Guitar Vader on our station

05:14.240 --> 05:15.240
soon.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.240
Cool.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.240
Very cool.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.840
I just want to say real quick, as far as live appearances go, we are confirmed for Fauna

05:19.840 --> 05:25.100
May 2007, and next year maybe we're looking to broadcast from the center stage, which

05:25.100 --> 05:26.440
should be pretty awesome.

05:26.440 --> 05:31.520
We are, our friend there is working on getting us broadcasting ability.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.520
Very cool.

05:32.520 --> 05:36.240
And just other live appearances coming up, I know in July, and not even these guys know

05:36.240 --> 05:40.120
about this yet, but there's the Sacramento thing is confirmed for July.

05:40.120 --> 05:48.520
And how I knew about that, is I ordered a doll, I'm getting into the 60 centimeter volks

05:48.520 --> 05:49.520
of B2 dolls.

05:49.520 --> 05:54.000
I ordered from JunkieSpot and he called me today to make sure that my address was right.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.760
and just gave me all kinds of pointers and tips

05:55.760 --> 05:57.580
and said, and we're gonna be at this convention.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.000
I was like, oh, I might be there.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.260
That's funny.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.760
So I find that ironic.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.320
No, we're gonna do that in Sacramento in July

06:04.320 --> 06:08.120
and then they're trying to get us to Seattle next year

06:08.120 --> 06:09.000
if we can afford it.

06:09.000 --> 06:09.900
I know at least I'll go

06:09.900 --> 06:11.280
and I think Jamie was talking about going

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
so maybe if we can get Loki,

06:12.280 --> 06:14.400
we'll all go to the Sakura Con next year.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.240
And then I...

06:15.240 --> 06:16.080
It's me Con.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.720
I'm hoping to do one East Coast Con next year.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.600
I don't know what or when yet.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.840
That'll really be up to Ranma,

06:21.840 --> 06:24.320
who's my like East Coast buddy.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.920
He'll have to tell me which con I should go to, so we'll see.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.080
And maybe DarkSakura will come with me if she's got the dough.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.040
Someone's got money. We'll see. Alright, let's get into some gaming.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.220
We always like to start off the show with how is your gaming week?

06:37.220 --> 06:40.460
So let's talk about it. Oh, first though, a shout out to the invisible

06:40.460 --> 06:44.680
forecast, our chat room, www.orangelauncherater.com. Click on chat

06:44.680 --> 06:49.200
and a little bit of talk there in the chat room right now.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.680
I don't know why Snakes on a Plane jokes are coming up, but that's what Sakurina is doing

06:52.680 --> 06:53.680
right now.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.000
I haven't seen him in a while in chat room though.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.280
Blaze wants to know when we're all coming out to the East Coast.

06:59.280 --> 07:03.440
I at least will probably try to come to a con in the beginning of next year.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.360
We'll see.

07:06.360 --> 07:12.120
And then Spirit Snare is linking us to a topic regarding Fonami07 on the Fonami boards.

07:12.120 --> 07:16.840
I guess there's actually a discussion about us at Fonami07 there, so that's kind of cool.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.200
And then DJ Pooh Eater says, I thought it was the Cher show.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.160
Okay, let the joke die.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.920
It was actually Spirit Snare that bought me chocolate.

07:24.920 --> 07:25.920
Awesome.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.920
Sweet.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.120
Alright, anyway, let's do how your gaming week was.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.400
Dark Sakura, want to start us off?

07:30.400 --> 07:36.520
I played some Ragnarok, and I made Assassin, finally, I hit job level 50, and now I'm like

07:36.520 --> 07:41.480
Assassin job level 24, and that happened in like a day.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.600
And that's basically been it.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.700
There has been UNO going on in my house.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.640
And we were going to buy a whirlwind pinball machine, but that fell through.

07:51.640 --> 07:58.480
We got back our Judge Dredd machine, and as it's working out, we've got a line in on a

07:58.480 --> 07:59.480
jackpot.

07:59.480 --> 08:06.840
Well, a pinbot right now, but Dan's wanting to find a jackpot, which has the same...

08:06.840 --> 08:08.300
It's pinball games, people.

08:08.300 --> 08:12.900
Has the same play field as pinbot and has the same music as pinbot and the special music.

08:12.900 --> 08:19.460
It's like a combination of pinbot and bride of pinbot with a souped-up display and board

08:19.460 --> 08:20.460
and everything.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.260
Okay, if you get that, I'm going to be at your house every day.

08:23.260 --> 08:27.980
I told Dan that and he was like, well, half the reason we get the pins is for friends

08:27.980 --> 08:28.980
to play.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.780
You still have to come over and play our other pins too.

08:30.780 --> 08:34.540
I was going to say, what is with the sudden interest in pinball games?

08:34.540 --> 08:35.540
Sudden my butt?

08:35.540 --> 08:36.540
It feels...

08:36.540 --> 08:37.540
Dan's been...

08:37.540 --> 08:39.520
Yeah, but you guys haven't really bought machines before.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.520
It seems like...

08:40.520 --> 08:41.520
Well, we had an apartment before.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.620
All right, all right.

08:42.620 --> 08:47.820
We have a garage now, which we intend on filling with machines, but Dan's been downloading

08:47.820 --> 08:54.080
the pinball emulators like PinMame and some of those for like ages, and one of the machines

08:54.080 --> 08:58.200
that we're really, really looking for, although it's really expensive, we want to get a good

08:58.200 --> 09:00.600
deal on one, is a Black Knight 2000.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.040
I think I've asked this on a previous show, like a long time ago, before we were podcasting.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.160
Is PinMame based out of Sacramento, the people who do that?

09:08.160 --> 09:09.160
Nearby.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.660
seen a car around town that has like a pin maim license plate and I'm like, dude is that

09:13.660 --> 09:14.660
the guy?

09:14.660 --> 09:15.660
No dude, it's Carmichael.

09:15.660 --> 09:16.660
Really?

09:16.660 --> 09:17.660
I think he's out of Carmichael because Dan's been by there.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.480
We need to get that guy on the show.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.480
That's just a stone's throw away.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.720
We'll have to get ahold of him.

09:21.720 --> 09:25.440
Loki practically, no, I know you're in Orangevale, I'm not Carmichael.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.840
It's all a blur to me.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.840
Suburbs of Sacramento.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.840
Anyway.

09:28.840 --> 09:29.840
It's the various areas.

09:29.840 --> 09:30.840
Anyway.

09:30.840 --> 09:31.840
You have goldfish.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.840
They're gone, sorry.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.840
You bet.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.840
I no longer like you.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.840
They're actually pretzel goldfish.

09:35.840 --> 09:36.840
Anyway, your games.

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
Games, oh yeah.

09:37.840 --> 09:43.680
I've been playing goldfish the game. No, I actually have been doing not a whole

09:43.680 --> 09:47.760
much of gaming. I've been intending on sitting down with Kingdom Hearts but

09:47.760 --> 09:54.800
I've been like meh meh and it's just been pinball pinball pinball pinball and

09:54.800 --> 10:00.160
I played pack... I played Dig Dug on one of those little joystick looking video game

10:00.160 --> 10:04.640
machines. Oh machine in a joystick? Yeah the machine in a joystick thing. They had a

10:04.640 --> 10:07.760
Pac-man score tournament, and then I was like screw y'all. I'm playing Dig Dug

10:07.760 --> 10:14.020
And so I got like further in Dig Dug than anybody in the house could. Sweet. Yep. All right Dig Dug, man

10:14.300 --> 10:18.140
I'm going over to the chat room who's all lit up about pinball. I'm sure you'll love this Jamie

10:18.460 --> 10:21.300
Yuri, lover says South Park pinball equals the shiz

10:22.100 --> 10:27.300
Bandit says the Super Mario Brothers pinball ruled. They had one of those at that place that went to and it was already sold. Oh

10:27.820 --> 10:32.900
Because Super Mario World pinball. Now there's two types of Super Mario pinball because one was for kids. This was the kid size

10:32.900 --> 10:36.000
I don't like the kids size one, but they had an adult size one too. That was awesome

10:36.000 --> 10:39.380
They had the kid one at Stockton Golf the Lord of the Rings pinball is the win

10:39.380 --> 10:43.540
But it was the Lord of the Rings pinball and Star Wars pinball were of the pinball

10:43.540 --> 10:45.840
I think it's called pinball 2000 series

10:46.100 --> 10:51.300
Which actually did not appeal to a lot of pinball players because it was more of an old-school pinball thing

10:51.300 --> 10:55.820
So there's I think those are the only two pinball 2000 machines are and we're not seeing any more

10:55.820 --> 11:01.300
I think Williams stopped making pinball machines. Hmm. One of the last pinball machines that I would love to play is

11:01.300 --> 11:06.460
It was called Big Bang Bar, which was one that Capcom did.

11:06.460 --> 11:11.240
They made something like 16 of them, and I've actually seen video of someone playing one,

11:11.240 --> 11:16.100
and the guys who owned that machine were kind enough to lend the layout of the board and

11:16.100 --> 11:17.780
the ROM set to put on pinmame.

11:17.780 --> 11:18.780
Oh, that's cool.

11:18.780 --> 11:22.620
So, it's a very good table, but there's only 16 of them in existence.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.260
I'd love to see one.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.380
We need, yeah, we do need Orange Lounge Pinball.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.140
DJ Pooeater says, O-L-R Pinball would be fun.

11:29.140 --> 11:31.180
You get to bang around Lookie's balls.

11:31.180 --> 11:36.240
I don't know how lucky you would feel about that, but I do like DJ poo eaters other comment about I like the Elvira pinball

11:36.240 --> 11:37.240
Cuz Elvira is the shit

11:37.240 --> 11:42.480
I didn't I you know actually one of the old-school ones that they had there that they were repairing was an Elektra pinball

11:42.520 --> 11:47.820
They wouldn't had the three levels the inside level the medium and the outside level. It's actually pretty

11:48.400 --> 11:53.560
From what I understand pretty hard to get one of those, but we actually traded them our fathom pinball for Johnny mnemonic

11:54.200 --> 11:57.320
DMN has a great idea snakes on a plane pinball. I think

11:57.320 --> 12:02.760
As if. It was sad, though, is that, you know, I think that pinballs are like a dying breed.

12:02.760 --> 12:07.960
Let me just kind of say, what do you think about pinball games on a video?

12:07.960 --> 12:11.560
Well, they've actually, this is a good thing, the people who do

12:11.560 --> 12:15.200
UltraCade are doing UltraPin.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.360
And the way that that's going to work is that it's going to be

12:18.360 --> 12:22.600
a humongous widescreen LCD laid out like a pinball table.

12:22.600 --> 12:27.280
What? They've actually had some of these at trade shows. That's kind of neat.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.500
and I like that matrix displays up in the back is it really a replacement for

12:31.500 --> 12:32.680
an actual table though

12:32.680 --> 12:35.980
but I don't know the whole thing about this is that is actually going to

12:35.980 --> 12:39.740
emulate some like 30 to 60 I think something

12:39.740 --> 12:43.660
a classic tables including Black Knight

12:43.660 --> 12:48.420
pin by right up in by it I have to find some more information on it they've had

12:48.420 --> 12:49.540
and they've actually I think

12:49.540 --> 12:52.500
this is something test locations I guess that's cool but it's

12:52.500 --> 12:56.660
I just don't like that idea as much as actually watching the metal ball go up

12:56.660 --> 13:00.080
the ramp and around I'd have to see it but I'd say I'd say though that for the

13:00.080 --> 13:03.440
sake of you know since these tables are getting harder and harder to find I

13:03.440 --> 13:08.540
think that it's it's a good idea it's a good idea to bring it out there for

13:08.540 --> 13:12.560
people who who miss the old-school pinball action right all right well

13:12.560 --> 13:17.080
before we turn into the pinball show we better get back on video there's nothing

13:17.080 --> 13:20.800
wrong with there's a video screen in the background with the dot matrix but hey

13:20.800 --> 13:22.800
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.800
Um, it was okay.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.800
I tried to play more games,

13:26.800 --> 13:28.800
but unfortunately the wife has been

13:28.800 --> 13:30.800
hogging the 360 and played Bejeweled.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.800
This is so weird to hear

13:32.800 --> 13:34.800
because the wife hates video games.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.800
Yeah, yeah, so,

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
what'd I do yesterday? Yeah, I was playing

13:38.800 --> 13:40.800
more New Super Mario Brothers

13:40.800 --> 13:42.800
and I'm already getting tired of the game.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.800
I'm already at, like, level

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
on level 4, I've actually

13:46.800 --> 13:48.800
completely finished

13:48.800 --> 13:51.940
one through three and gotten all the secret stuff and all that

13:51.940 --> 13:53.460
uh...

13:53.460 --> 13:57.060
i'm just kinda getting bored with it already

13:57.060 --> 14:00.780
i don't know it's just not as good as some of the other games i guess

14:00.780 --> 14:06.420
uh... then i've been playing trying to get through ghost recon i'm almost done with that

14:06.420 --> 14:09.820
finally and then uh...

14:09.820 --> 14:14.340
i don't know i've been trying a few other games i tried that uh...

14:14.340 --> 14:16.480
what was it? jewel quest

14:16.480 --> 14:18.500
that was okay

14:18.500 --> 14:23.340
I don't know. I've already bought like almost every single live game or arcade game on there

14:23.340 --> 14:28.100
except for like the crappy card games. Who wants crappy card games? I mean seriously.

14:28.100 --> 14:35.640
Even if you don't like Uno. Uno's fun! I like Uno. Uno's fun, but like, you know, hard

14:35.640 --> 14:43.640
with hearts, hard with backgammon, I mean, no. Lame. Um, but um, I don't know. It's just,

14:43.640 --> 14:48.040
I haven't really gotten anything new. No new games coming out that I really want.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.120
Hitman maybe. I really don't know though. I'm thinking

14:52.120 --> 14:56.560
just waiting till July-August when some better games come out.

14:56.560 --> 15:01.360
But I am... I have been to

15:01.360 --> 15:04.520
get Jaws on my

15:04.520 --> 15:07.760
PlayStation 2 hard drive so I can bust that game out because

15:07.760 --> 15:11.840
I heard the game is so damn glitchy and stuff but it's worth trying because you can

15:11.840 --> 15:12.840
play as a shark.

15:12.840 --> 15:16.640
You know what though, with a concept like that, it might be cool to have a game as glitchy

15:16.640 --> 15:18.200
as Driver 3.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.200
It is.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.520
It is as glitchy as Driver 3.

15:20.520 --> 15:25.040
So that's kind of cool, you know, because Driver 3, that was what made it fun, is the

15:25.040 --> 15:27.080
fact that it was so crappy.

15:27.080 --> 15:38.320
It had the perfect balance of really shitty AI and gameplay with, you know, just an okay

15:38.320 --> 15:39.320
game.

15:39.320 --> 15:44.480
It wasn't so bad to where as you don't want to play it, but it wasn't, you know, so good

15:44.480 --> 15:46.160
as where as you need to pick it up.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.920
It's just equally awful, you know, across all levels.

15:50.920 --> 15:55.080
So that game's really fun, especially if you can get it cheap, because it's so glitchy

15:55.080 --> 15:57.580
you can literally play it for like an afternoon and just...

15:57.580 --> 15:58.580
So it's like one of those...

15:58.580 --> 15:59.580
It's like a B-movie.

15:59.580 --> 16:00.580
It is.

16:00.580 --> 16:01.580
It's like a bad B-movie.

16:01.580 --> 16:02.580
It's like a showgirl.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.580
It's so bad it's good.

16:03.580 --> 16:04.580
Exactly.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.580
Like Jaws 3D.

16:05.580 --> 16:14.580
Jaws on the console switch just came out. It's a cheap-ass game, it's like $29.99, but

16:14.580 --> 16:18.660
just wait a couple of weeks. Once people buy it and say, hey, this game sucks, and then

16:18.660 --> 16:25.140
they sell it back, get those copies for even cheaper. So that's what you need to do.

16:25.140 --> 16:29.900
Alright. Anything else? Just a grant of thought, I will liberate these city stories again.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.620
As usual. Yeah, we're going back to the team games,

16:32.620 --> 16:37.260
have been doing free-for-alls and it's still fun because we just find new ways to kill

16:37.260 --> 16:45.900
each other so it's it's still you know a highlight of the day all right um i should mention in

16:45.900 --> 16:49.620
our chat room right now over at orange launcher.com click on chat if you are listening live here

16:49.620 --> 16:55.260
on sunday night on our station uh it looks like dmn is in chat right now and he for whatever

16:55.260 --> 17:00.340
reason has an extra zelda gamecube collector's disc burning a hole in his pocket you know

17:00.340 --> 17:04.600
the one that had all the classic Zelda games on it, and he's just giving it away to a random

17:04.600 --> 17:08.320
chatter right now. He's asking trivia questions and making a game out of it, and you know,

17:08.320 --> 17:11.360
he's like, you guys cool with it? And I'm like, yeah, you know, I got ripped out of

17:11.360 --> 17:15.680
the one that actually had the Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on there as well, I only got the one

17:15.680 --> 17:21.920
with both of the Nintendo 64 ones. I might have an extra. You could enter DMN's contest

17:21.920 --> 17:27.260
right now. I don't care, but I never played that one anyway, so, you know what, we need

17:27.260 --> 17:30.220
to get we need to get one of those multiplayer pac-man games that was the

17:30.220 --> 17:36.580
one on the GameCube remember oh pac-man vs right yeah I never did play that look

17:36.580 --> 17:39.540
fun though all right um I want to go over to my gaming week because I

17:39.540 --> 17:42.980
actually have quite a bit that I was playing this week in my personal life I

17:42.980 --> 17:47.020
got jury duty this week and most people were telling me that jury duty you know

17:47.020 --> 17:50.460
bring a book it's gonna be boring you're gonna sit there all day long and

17:50.460 --> 17:54.820
nothing's gonna happen so I took my DS and yeah there was a lot of dead time

17:54.820 --> 17:58.900
there but the rest of it didn't go how they said it would they said I would get

17:58.900 --> 18:02.180
dismissed by the end of the day I actually got put on a jury for a trial

18:02.180 --> 18:07.060
that's gonna last two weeks so I guess I'll be playing a lot of DS while I'm at

18:07.060 --> 18:09.820
the gore house because there's a lot of down I mean we get like hour and a half

18:09.820 --> 18:13.840
lunches and all this crazy stuff so I have DS to keep me busy I've been

18:13.840 --> 18:19.580
playing Final Fantasy 1 which I realize is not a DS game but Extifer will like

18:19.580 --> 18:22.940
keeps forgetting to loan me the new Super Mario Brothers cartridge that I

18:22.940 --> 18:27.500
keep wanting to play and the only other game I had like ready available when I

18:27.500 --> 18:31.140
left for the courthouse was Super Princess Peach and that game kind of I

18:31.140 --> 18:36.580
don't know like I an action game isn't as easy to play at something like in

18:36.580 --> 18:40.460
that type of situation so Final Fantasy I can get a little more out of so I've

18:40.460 --> 18:45.380
been playing that again the dawn of souls it was on Game Boy Advance I'm

18:45.380 --> 18:48.500
just using that in the Game Boy Advance slot and I lost my stylus though which

18:48.500 --> 18:53.540
me off, not that I need it for Final Fantasy I, but I just thought I'd throw that in there.

18:53.540 --> 18:58.180
But Final Fantasy I, of course, if you haven't played it before, the one on the Game Boy

18:58.180 --> 19:02.340
Advance, they really souped it up from the NES, it's not as frustrating because they

19:02.340 --> 19:08.380
switched the battle system to more like Final Fantasy IV, where if your whole party attacks

19:08.380 --> 19:12.500
one monster and it dies, it doesn't end up being wasted attacks, it will attack a different

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
monster.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.540
I know that was one really frustrating thing about Final Fantasy I on the NES, but that

19:17.540 --> 19:21.780
That kind of adds to the strategy element, I suppose, but that is different.

19:21.780 --> 19:30.100
I also got a chance to play something new, 2DX Red, Beatmania 2DX RED, or 11, and this

19:30.100 --> 19:31.100
is the import game.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.100
It's not here in America.

19:32.100 --> 19:37.540
You do have to import it from Japan, and of course, if you know Beatmania in the US, then

19:37.540 --> 19:45.060
I'm sure you have heard of the Japanese series that spawned it, and now it's up to its 11th

19:45.060 --> 19:50.780
version game, thirteenth arcade game. The things I like about 2DX Red, the interface

19:50.780 --> 19:56.120
is great, it's slick, it's got an awesome interface, it's a customizable interface.

19:56.120 --> 20:01.480
One of the things you unlock, you don't really unlock songs in 2DX anymore, you unlock either

20:01.480 --> 20:06.900
gallery art or you unlock customization pieces. So you can actually change the picture that's

20:06.900 --> 20:11.700
on the turntable, the bar that is falling down during the parts of the song, what the

20:11.700 --> 20:15.120
notes look like when they explode when you hit the buttons or you can change

20:15.120 --> 20:16.400
the whole damn

20:16.400 --> 20:20.360
like skin around it now you'd you know there's only like ten or I don't know

20:20.360 --> 20:24.240
not even that many probably like seven or so preset ones so you don't have total

20:24.240 --> 20:27.120
freedom but it's still pretty cool because you can mix and match and kind of

20:27.120 --> 20:29.880
make the game your own a little bit so I thought that was kind of a neat addition

20:29.880 --> 20:31.960
uh... and something fun to unlock there

20:31.960 --> 20:36.640
uh... my other my only real problem with Beatmania 2DX Red is that I'm not

20:36.640 --> 20:39.800
a fan of the songs as much as previous styles

20:39.800 --> 20:44.480
there's some really good songs but like overall I think I prefer like 9th, 7th

20:44.480 --> 20:47.240
you know kinda going back to some of the older styles

20:47.240 --> 20:50.320
but they did bring back some good older songs

20:50.320 --> 20:52.240
except V isn't one of them

20:52.240 --> 20:55.600
V is this song that has been in like every Beatmania 2DX game in Japan

20:55.600 --> 20:57.480
since 5th Style, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th

20:57.480 --> 20:59.120
it is not in 11th

20:59.120 --> 21:00.920
they finally gave it a rest for a little while

21:00.920 --> 21:03.200
yeah until they come up with the next you know

21:03.200 --> 21:07.680
was it 2DX 14 or whatever and it's gonna be V2 or something like that

21:07.680 --> 21:11.140
or VV or something. It'll be H, it'll be Handel.

21:11.140 --> 21:14.820
We'll see. The other part that I

21:14.820 --> 21:19.220
I love about 2DX Red is rival data because Miklotov is the one that brought

21:19.220 --> 21:19.500
it

21:19.500 --> 21:22.780
to the house here so I had a chance to play it and I

21:22.780 --> 21:26.820
started playing on my memory card. Well I was able to put in his memory card and

21:26.820 --> 21:28.420
load his scores

21:28.420 --> 21:31.940
onto my card. So what that would do is it would show me, hey,

21:31.940 --> 21:35.340
these are the songs you're doing better than Miklotov at and these are the songs you

21:35.340 --> 21:37.660
need to improve on if you want to be better than Miklotov.

21:37.660 --> 21:41.240
and you can, I think, load up to five people. And the other cool thing is you

21:41.240 --> 21:43.300
can do rival data against yourself,

21:43.300 --> 21:46.660
essentially. If you go into the options and you go like all the way down to the

21:46.660 --> 21:49.220
bottom and you see this little turntable, you can change it so that

21:49.220 --> 21:53.500
if you're playing one player, you know how usually in Beatmania the right side of

21:53.500 --> 21:55.900
the screen, if you're playing left or vice versa, if you're a

21:55.900 --> 21:59.860
player two side person, the left side is just blank. Nothing happens there.

21:59.860 --> 22:03.420
What will happen instead is that that'll be replaced by a bar graph

22:03.420 --> 22:07.580
that goes up showing you how your combo compares to the last game that you

22:07.580 --> 22:08.020
played

22:08.020 --> 22:11.340
I'm sorry, not your combo, but your Beatmania points. You get plus two for a

22:11.340 --> 22:13.020
flashing grate, plus one for a grate

22:13.020 --> 22:16.220
it kinda shows that in bar graph. Very similar to keyboard mania. If you've ever played

22:16.220 --> 22:18.540
keyboard mania, it's almost like they stole it from keyboard mania.

22:18.540 --> 22:22.020
So, huh?

22:22.020 --> 22:27.540
Alright, so rival data is pretty cool and it kinda gives you

22:27.540 --> 22:30.980
incentive to keep playing because I have to be better than Miklotov, so that's 2DX Red.

22:30.980 --> 22:36.380
I definitely recommend it to music games fans that have a Japanese PlayStation 2.

22:36.380 --> 22:40.140
Those you guys that don't have a Japanese PlayStation 2, let's hope that

22:40.140 --> 22:43.700
Konami of America releases a Beatmania 2 here in the US

22:43.700 --> 22:46.700
and that they'll use this game's interface to model it off of,

22:46.700 --> 22:50.300
and I think that would happen and that would be pretty sweet.

22:50.300 --> 22:54.460
Another Japanese game I checked out this week is R2 Beat

22:54.460 --> 22:58.420
and this is a game that was at E3 and it was a racing game

22:58.420 --> 23:01.420
but it's a music game as well. It's a music racing game.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.940
So those you guys that say that the music game

23:04.940 --> 23:08.980
idea is dead and that all the music games are the same and the guitar heroes are the same

23:08.980 --> 23:10.580
game as Beatmania and da da da da da,

23:10.580 --> 23:15.940
you need to play R2B because R2B is a real creative idea for a music game.

23:15.940 --> 23:19.380
I really like it because it gets into the kind of competitive nature a little

23:19.380 --> 23:20.540
more, like some of the

23:20.540 --> 23:26.060
songs are very competitive. So if you want to check this out,

23:26.060 --> 23:31.060
One of our listeners has a website that's all about this game, and you're going to

23:31.060 --> 23:34.820
have to follow the directions on the forums of this website to be able to play the game

23:34.820 --> 23:37.500
because it's all in Japanese.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.480
So unless you read and understand Japanese fluently, you're not going to really be able

23:41.480 --> 23:45.340
to play the game unless you use some of the translation guides at this site mixed with

23:45.340 --> 23:46.340
Google translation.

23:46.340 --> 23:48.060
I'm going to give out the site address real fast.

23:48.060 --> 23:52.100
It's djmaxus.bamanistyle.com.

23:52.100 --> 23:56.620
And really the website is dedicated to DJ Maxx, which is another game, but R2Beat, go

23:56.620 --> 24:00.740
to the forums and there's more information on this R2Beat.

24:00.740 --> 24:05.040
It kind of makes me think of like a Mario Kart rhythm game, because in one of the modes

24:05.040 --> 24:09.020
you can use items on other players, and it's pretty creative, some of the items they come

24:09.020 --> 24:10.020
up with.

24:10.020 --> 24:13.500
Like one of them will send out this giant King Kong type thing onto the race track that

24:13.500 --> 24:17.940
will beat the race track so that your screen shakes, so it's really hard to see the notes

24:17.940 --> 24:19.660
as they're coming down.

24:19.660 --> 24:23.800
Another item will throw headphones onto your opponent's head that will change the song

24:23.800 --> 24:27.180
completely that they're hearing, so that the beats won't match up or anything, makes it

24:27.180 --> 24:28.960
very difficult for a couple measures.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.180
So it's kind of fun, so that's kind of where I get the Mario Kart thing, because the items

24:32.180 --> 24:35.240
really add a whole different flair to it.

24:35.240 --> 24:41.180
So the pros about this game, it's free, graphically it's pretty kick-butt, I was given a tip,

24:41.180 --> 24:43.960
you can actually use Alt-Enter to play the game in a window if you don't like it taking

24:43.960 --> 24:47.560
up your whole screen, and it's a real kind of clever music game.

24:47.560 --> 24:52.580
The only cons that I really saw is that it's got a really steep learning curve

24:52.580 --> 24:57.300
because of the fact that the game's not in English, so you really have to be

24:57.300 --> 24:59.380
patient if you want to learn this game.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.360
You'll get frustrated with it very easy if the language barrier is going to be a

25:03.360 --> 25:04.360
problem for you.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.680
But I force myself to kind of get through the tutorial and everything and

25:07.680 --> 25:10.760
it's not so bad. You can figure it out. Use common sense, you'll figure out how to

25:10.760 --> 25:11.320
play the game.

25:11.320 --> 25:16.040
So I like it. I think you guys should check it out if you get a chance if you

25:16.040 --> 25:18.040
like music games because it's free.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.740
I don't know if this is the type of game I would pay money for, just because it seems

25:21.740 --> 25:25.560
like the type of game I'll only play for a little while, even though it does offer some

25:25.560 --> 25:29.900
kind of customization, like you can change your hair, change your clothes.

25:29.900 --> 25:33.100
I don't really see myself playing this the long term, but I don't know.

25:33.100 --> 25:37.820
They do have the fact that they can expand with different songs, and they can expand

25:37.820 --> 25:38.820
the game later.

25:38.820 --> 25:42.900
I think what would be neat, and I think this is the way the company that hosts this game

25:42.900 --> 25:46.300
has it set up. I think

25:46.300 --> 25:50.260
it's part of a network of a bunch of other different kinds of games

25:50.260 --> 25:54.980
and I think in that way it'll be great. It's actually part of a network called

25:54.980 --> 25:56.100
gamechoo.jp

25:56.100 --> 25:59.660
that's their website gamechoo.jp

25:59.660 --> 26:03.180
and I think I would really enjoy this game like it's a part of

26:03.180 --> 26:06.740
a selection of games from a website so

26:06.740 --> 26:10.300
check it out if you guys wanna see a crazy looking

26:10.300 --> 26:15.340
game. Other than that, just a buffet of Xbox Live Arcade games and some Rockstar

26:15.340 --> 26:16.020
Table Tennis.

26:16.020 --> 26:20.040
That's all for me. Alright, let's get into some gaming news

26:20.040 --> 26:23.620
here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to start off tonight with

26:23.620 --> 26:27.300
Loki, I think. Yes, and basically

26:27.300 --> 26:30.380
the story to start things off is about

26:30.380 --> 26:35.420
the DS Lite and how some stores just don't get street dates.

26:35.420 --> 26:38.740
One of those store chains being Target,

26:38.740 --> 26:44.660
The other one being Walmart and basically, you know, the shipments of these new systems

26:44.660 --> 26:46.940
have already come in to pretty much everybody.

26:46.940 --> 26:50.700
In fact, I mean, my company that I work at, they actually have them right now.

26:50.700 --> 26:55.060
Of course, you know, like most things, you're not supposed to sell it until street date,

26:55.060 --> 27:00.620
you know, to basically either make it, you know, fair for everybody, you know, so that

27:00.620 --> 27:03.660
one person doesn't have it sooner than the other and that type of thing.

27:03.660 --> 27:07.460
But you know, companies don't realize this or either just ignore it.

27:07.460 --> 27:12.620
And so, you know, in the case of like certain Targets and Walmarts, just went ahead and

27:12.620 --> 27:14.100
sold it the day they got them.

27:14.100 --> 27:20.100
So people have already been picking them up, put them on eBay and whatnot.

27:20.100 --> 27:24.220
So basically if you're lucky enough to find one, more power to you.

27:24.220 --> 27:27.620
Which is ridiculous since you can just order them online from Japan.

27:27.620 --> 27:28.620
Exactly.

27:28.620 --> 27:29.620
It doesn't matter anyways.

27:29.620 --> 27:30.620
For almost the same price.

27:30.620 --> 27:31.620
I mean they're really coming out in about a week.

27:31.620 --> 27:32.620
Yeah.

27:32.620 --> 27:33.620
Just wait.

27:33.620 --> 27:34.700
And by the way, this is not the first time Targets broke a street date.

27:34.700 --> 27:35.700
Oh no.

27:35.700 --> 27:36.700
No.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.700
They've done like, you know, Katamari and stuff.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.700
Yeah, We Heart Katamari, I remember when it was called the Target.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.700
Yeah, and you know what?

27:42.700 --> 27:46.700
These companies, you know, they think that they're getting away with this shit.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.700
You know, Nintendo will know.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.700
I mean, it's just like, you know, Namco.

27:50.700 --> 27:53.700
Namco was aware of the problem with We Heart Katamari.

27:53.700 --> 27:56.700
Or not We Heart Katamari. Yeah, We Heart Katamari.

27:56.700 --> 28:00.700
And they basically, you know, those stores will not be getting their product on time.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.700
Or they'll be getting it at the day of, or whatever.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.700
They won't get it early anymore.

28:04.700 --> 28:08.380
that's not a good thing to do to piss off the Nintendo right before the Wii launch

28:08.380 --> 28:12.580
because uh you know if they don't have it people are going other places so

28:12.580 --> 28:15.980
it's not good for them yeah that's what they did with GameStop and stuff when

28:15.980 --> 28:18.760
GameStop didn't have the pre-orders people went to Best Buy who didn't do

28:18.760 --> 28:20.180
pre-orders and tried to

28:20.180 --> 28:23.820
you know get it that way so yeah so I mean

28:23.820 --> 28:27.900
if you can find them really great to be honest it's just a redesign of the damn console

28:27.900 --> 28:28.420
I mean

28:28.420 --> 28:31.380
do you really need one right away you don't

28:31.380 --> 28:36.380
I actually don't think they're any more comfortable to play than

28:36.380 --> 28:40.740
the US ones anyway because of that sharp edge.

28:40.740 --> 28:45.300
Um, DarkSakura, do you have any news about the colors

28:45.300 --> 28:48.700
of the systems that we're seeing? Well actually, in Europe

28:48.700 --> 28:51.700
they're getting two colors. They're getting black and

28:51.700 --> 28:54.740
white. Pretty

28:54.740 --> 28:58.180
monochrome there. Now that's interesting because we're only getting white.

28:58.180 --> 29:03.380
They get black because they're special I guess I guess getting screwed on the price finally

29:04.060 --> 29:07.460
Karma pays off for them because they always get screwed on prices their price actually

29:07.860 --> 29:12.680
It's gonna be out on June 23rd in Europe their prices 99.99

29:13.620 --> 29:16.020
Pounds or a 149.99 euro

29:17.700 --> 29:20.700
Also as far as some games that they're getting on June 30th

29:20.700 --> 29:25.420
the new Super Mario Brothers will be out, Brain Training is on June 9th,

29:25.420 --> 29:28.780
Nintendogs Dalmatian and Friends is on June 16th.

29:28.780 --> 29:32.300
I'm getting a Dalmatian one, which is,

29:32.300 --> 29:36.340
actually I would be jealous if I even played my Nintendogs anymore, sorry.

29:36.340 --> 29:42.020
Alright, now VidPowah in our chat room reminds us that there actually is a

29:42.020 --> 29:43.180
Frapper map.

29:43.180 --> 29:47.700
Orange House Radio has a Frapper map too, so if you're on Frapper, F-R-A-P-P-R dot com,

29:47.700 --> 29:48.300
look us up.

29:48.300 --> 29:53.020
but you can also look up dslightavailability, just cram that all together into one word,

29:53.020 --> 29:56.300
and they're actually checking targets to see if any have the dslight.

29:56.300 --> 30:02.060
I already looked in this area and there are none, because I kind of want one, but I don't know,

30:02.060 --> 30:08.060
we'll see, we'll see. All right, moving on with more news.

30:10.140 --> 30:16.060
Yes, in other news, also Nintendo related, we've got information that the Wii is not going to have

30:16.060 --> 30:22.780
doubly digital out, at least no 5.1 surround sound. They will have Pro Logic, which is

30:22.780 --> 30:27.020
still good, but I mean, I don't know, I don't think you really need it since they're not

30:27.020 --> 30:32.580
going to be doing HD anyways, so, you know, big deal. I don't know a lot of people out

30:32.580 --> 30:35.880
there, especially if you just have a standard TV setup, you're not going to have a surround

30:35.880 --> 30:40.940
sound either, so, you know, the Pro Logic works just as well, so I don't think that's

30:40.940 --> 30:47.940
a big deal. Not really a huge surprise either, but still, interesting information.

30:49.920 --> 30:53.800
I guess, I don't know, I don't have Dolby Digital in my house anyway, so I don't care,

30:53.800 --> 30:56.600
but I'm sure there's some people that will be kind of, hmm, but...

30:56.600 --> 31:00.120
Well, I'm kind of, I have Dolby Digital in my house.

31:00.120 --> 31:05.120
Okay, well, literally, I mean, who, okay, so you have it in your house, okay, that's

31:05.120 --> 31:11.280
That's great, but you have a Prologic setup on yours, so it sounds great.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.280
It sounds fine.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.240
My receiver also has Prologic.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.560
It's not going to be the end of the world.

31:15.560 --> 31:21.940
They're not supporting HD, I should say true HD or whatever anyway, so as long as the games

31:21.940 --> 31:24.320
are fun, I'm not going to worry too much about the sound.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.660
Plus we already know there's a speaker in the controller, which is kind of, can't really

31:27.660 --> 31:31.800
get that, 5.1 or not, digital 5.1, whatever.

31:31.800 --> 31:36.300
You don't have the speaker and the controller, so I'm willing to forgive them as long as

31:36.300 --> 31:37.300
the games are still fun.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.140
I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.

31:39.140 --> 31:48.020
And to be honest, the Xbox 360 does not have optical digital audio out either.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.380
Is PlayStation 3 looking at it?

31:49.380 --> 31:50.380
Is that another thing?

31:50.380 --> 31:56.060
PlayStation 2 had optical digital audio out, so I wouldn't imagine that PlayStation 3 does

31:56.060 --> 31:57.060
as well.

31:57.060 --> 32:01.300
Then again, that could be on one of those lists of things that they've scrapped for

32:01.300 --> 32:04.580
price point I don't know I'm gonna be honest I don't know a lot about audio

32:04.580 --> 32:07.700
setups this whole you know the different types kind of go over my head a little

32:07.700 --> 32:13.740
bit so it's interesting all right moving on we're gonna go to a story now about

32:13.740 --> 32:16.980
Sony and it kind of has to do with Nintendo because you know when Sony

32:16.980 --> 32:21.940
announced that tilt thing at e3 everybody said they stole the concept of

32:21.940 --> 32:26.780
the Wii they just are stealing from Nintendo well Sony Computer

32:26.780 --> 32:30.880
Entertainment Europe's Phil Harrison is a little pissed off that people would

32:30.880 --> 32:32.320
jump and say this.

32:32.320 --> 32:36.760
He said, �In a way, I understand why people say that we stole Nintendo�s idea, but it

32:36.760 --> 32:38.760
is a little stupid if you forgive the remark.

32:38.760 --> 32:44.040
When we brought the PlayStation to the market in 1994, we introduced real-time 3D graphics

32:44.040 --> 32:45.460
for the first time.

32:45.460 --> 32:50.120
When Nintendo launched its Nintendo 64 in 1996, it also had 3D graphics.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.280
Did we say Nintendo stole our idea?

32:52.280 --> 32:53.280
Obviously not.�

32:53.280 --> 32:57.720
No, of course not, because that whole PlayStation is supposed to be a CD drive for the Super

32:57.720 --> 32:58.720
Nintendo.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.280
It was built for Nintendo in the first place.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.160
All you do is put an operating system on it.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.160
Way to go, jackass.

33:04.160 --> 33:10.480
And there was Star Fox, and as far as there were games on the PC Engine Duo that had 3D.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.480
Exactly.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.520
So they are pretty much full of crap.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.640
Well I'm surprised he's not actually researching it.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.960
I've got two questions.

33:16.960 --> 33:20.160
First, did Sony steal Nintendo's idea, why or why not?

33:20.160 --> 33:21.160
I say no.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.160
Okay.

33:22.160 --> 33:27.320
I think they did something to make themselves competitive in that aspect, but I don't think

33:27.320 --> 33:31.240
stole the idea. How easy would it have been to just come out with a controller? It was

33:31.240 --> 33:35.120
the same thing. They tried something a little bit different, and although I'm not the biggest

33:35.120 --> 33:38.840
fan of the idea, I wouldn't say they stole it. I think they just kind of tried to do

33:38.840 --> 33:45.840
something a little competitive. I don't know. You guys' thoughts. DarkSakura, any?

33:46.280 --> 33:52.320
I really, the whole debate I think is ridiculous. It's over and done with. The item is coming

33:52.320 --> 33:56.040
out. There's nothing that can be done about it. To say one stole from the other, I'm putting

33:56.040 --> 33:59.880
that in the frame of pointless argument, there's really no point.

33:59.880 --> 34:04.520
Did they steal the idea of putting out a console? I mean... I don't really care, honestly.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.240
I mean, because

34:05.240 --> 34:09.120
it's moot. The system's been out since, like, I was in high school.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.800
You know, who's gonna talk about who stole what from the Super...

34:12.800 --> 34:16.280
you know, from the Super Nintendo having been out? You know,

34:16.280 --> 34:19.640
company... it's business. Companies steal from each other

34:19.640 --> 34:23.960
all the time. I was gonna say, when... remember when Vanilla Coke came out? Because we all loved

34:23.960 --> 34:26.420
vanilla Coke at the time when it first came out.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.040
Then vanilla Pepsi was a better product.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.820
Vanilla Pepsi came out like two months later.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.060
Is Pepsi a bunch of thieves?

34:31.060 --> 34:32.060
No, that's what they do.

34:32.060 --> 34:34.740
They always copy each other, you know?

34:34.740 --> 34:38.260
It's the point of business to find out other businesses trade secrets and cash in on it.

34:38.260 --> 34:39.900
Loki, you have a thought?

34:39.900 --> 34:40.900
Yeah, okay.

34:40.900 --> 34:45.140
So they say, we didn't copy the way it's been in production for two years.

34:45.140 --> 34:50.200
Two years ago, there was a game put out on Game of Advance called WarioWare Twisted.

34:50.200 --> 34:56.060
had the same kind of technology in there that's in the controller. So, fuck you Sony, you're

34:56.060 --> 35:03.120
still copying somebody. First off, you got your facts wrong anyway, so it doesn't matter.

35:03.120 --> 35:08.660
So they copied it, great, whatever. They've copied controller designs with the analog

35:08.660 --> 35:18.080
sticks and stuff from Nintendo 64, rumble from Nintendo 64, big deal. Xbox Live, they're

35:18.080 --> 35:22.860
They're going to be copying that for the Playstation 3 online service or whatever.

35:22.860 --> 35:26.320
It's what people like and so obviously you have to put it in your console.

35:26.320 --> 35:31.740
But don't try to pass it off as this is an original idea that you came up with.

35:31.740 --> 35:36.300
Basically say, yeah our competitions do it, we need to do this in order to be competitive.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.100
That's all you got to say.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.100
That is it.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.100
Pretty simple.

35:40.100 --> 35:44.060
Instead of being a jackass going, we came up with it first, no I don't think so.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.780
So you know what, great.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.720
If it works for your console, awesome.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.980
I think it's going to be stupid and, you know, if they're going to be taking out the rumble

35:51.980 --> 35:54.540
feature for this, I think it's a really bad trade-off.

35:54.540 --> 35:58.460
Alright, I gotta go to our chat room with some comments because they're lit up right

35:58.460 --> 35:59.460
now a little bit.

35:59.460 --> 36:03.340
Umm, for, spiritsnarrow would like to point out, Pepsi Blue came out but Coke Blue never

36:03.340 --> 36:04.340
did.

36:04.340 --> 36:07.660
That's because Pepsi Blue was kinda crappy.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.060
It was like Windex.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.060
I didn't like it at all.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.740
Yeah, it tastes like Windex and it made your poo change colors.

36:12.740 --> 36:15.100
I thank you for sharing.

36:15.100 --> 36:17.980
What else is there here?

36:17.980 --> 36:23.980
O2G said, maybe if they didn't implement it at the last minute.

36:23.980 --> 36:27.420
Do you think maybe the whole last minute implementation of this is what makes them look like they're

36:27.420 --> 36:28.420
thieving here?

36:28.420 --> 36:29.420
Yeah, it does.

36:29.420 --> 36:32.660
And if they were saying that, oh yeah, this is something we're thinking about or something

36:32.660 --> 36:37.580
like that, that would be a little different, you know, that was something they were toying

36:37.580 --> 36:38.580
around with.

36:38.580 --> 36:42.060
But the fact that they brought it in, I mean, so what if they've been working on it for

36:42.060 --> 36:43.060
two years?

36:43.060 --> 36:44.060
We haven't heard anything about it.

36:44.060 --> 36:47.940
You haven't seen anything until two weeks before E3.

36:47.940 --> 36:48.940
That's a little fishy.

36:48.940 --> 36:54.460
Just so you know, according to an article that appeared in MCV, Sony Computer Entertainment

36:54.460 --> 36:59.380
Europe, President and CEO David Reeve said, the DualShock 3 pad was not a last minute

36:59.380 --> 37:02.820
thing, but it's been in development for over two years.

37:02.820 --> 37:09.340
That's what I said, two years, and WarioWare came out, what, two years ago with the same

37:09.340 --> 37:10.860
type of tilt feature.

37:10.860 --> 37:11.860
Great.

37:11.860 --> 37:15.820
didnít steal from the Wii, but you stole from something else. You know, when the hell

37:15.820 --> 37:19.460
are they going to come out with something original? I mean, really, when are they going

37:19.460 --> 37:21.940
to come out with something original? Theyíre like one step behind everybody.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.020
Okay, this takes me to my second question. Whatís with all the Sony hate on this show

37:25.020 --> 37:26.220
lately? I donít know.

37:26.220 --> 37:28.780
I donít know if they put out a good product, Fiddler on Our Love.

37:28.780 --> 37:34.300
Seriously, the Playstation 2, I was out there first day, I bought it at launch, regardless

37:34.300 --> 37:38.380
of what games came out, but there were games I liked that came out at launch. The Armored

37:38.380 --> 37:43.120
Core at the time was one of the ones that I bought and it was great. I loved the game

37:43.120 --> 37:48.840
and the fact that the backwards compatibility was good and the price point wasn't outrageous

37:48.840 --> 37:54.240
and that type of stuff. But their system right now, they don't have a great lineup of games

37:54.240 --> 37:58.760
coming out. Granted, okay, the system may be cool, but it's pumping out the same kind

37:58.760 --> 38:02.280
of graphics, same kind of game plays you're going to be getting on the Xbox 360, but it's

38:02.280 --> 38:05.800
more expensive. And because they think that they need a Blu-ray driving there because

38:05.800 --> 38:12.780
are really trying to push this whole HD movie format on me. I don't want to pay the extra

38:12.780 --> 38:19.240
$200 for this thing when I've just a few years ago replaced all my VHS with DVDs. Now they

38:19.240 --> 38:24.220
want me to do this again? Why? I don't own an HDTV that's going to benefit from this

38:24.220 --> 38:28.740
so why should I have to spend the extra $200 for it? Plus they came out a year later. Plus

38:28.740 --> 38:32.700
they're doing all these unoriginal ideas. You know what? If they do come out with some

38:32.700 --> 38:36.400
really good games, like maybe a new Twisted Metal or something like that, that'd be great.

38:36.400 --> 38:41.320
But the whole thing, I mean, Sony's a great company and all, but even after the PSP came

38:41.320 --> 38:46.140
out and the launch games for that, the launch games were pitiful for the PSP. They were

38:46.140 --> 38:50.780
all just rehashed, you know what, Twisted Metal head on, that's Twisted Metal 2, all

38:50.780 --> 38:54.900
over again. Luminous being a glaring exception though. Well yeah, but that's a third party

38:54.900 --> 38:58.560
company though, that's a third party, I mean that game could have been made on, you know,

38:58.560 --> 39:03.180
the original PlayStation 2. I mean, it's not something that really needed the PlayStation

39:03.180 --> 39:08.660
portable. And, you know, I'm not like picking on Sony just because, you know, oh, I'm pro

39:08.660 --> 39:11.780
Microsoft or something like that. Granted, Microsoft, I mean, they haven't, how many

39:11.780 --> 39:16.420
games has Microsoft come out with in the last, you know, few months? What, we had three,

39:16.420 --> 39:20.740
you know, in May, one in June. I mean, where the hell are all the games? That's, you know,

39:20.740 --> 39:22.420
something that we should be talking about also.

39:22.420 --> 39:26.340
All right. Let me interject here with some comments from chat, although some folks in

39:26.340 --> 39:29.820
are cheering you on there, Boy Wonder Zero and Hentairini.

39:29.820 --> 39:33.320
FunnyDale is mentioning, if anyone should sue anyone,

39:33.320 --> 39:37.020
it should be Ralph Baer. He was the guy who invented the idea for a home video

39:37.020 --> 39:41.020
game console and got almost nothing out of it himself.

39:41.020 --> 39:42.620
Interesting thought.

39:42.620 --> 39:45.580
I'll phrase a question towards DarkSakura, because I know you have not

39:45.580 --> 39:49.300
been a fan of Sony's PlayStation 3 stuff lately.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.740
What could Sony do

39:51.740 --> 39:53.200
to win you over

39:53.200 --> 39:55.980
and you would be rah rah rah about this console on launch day?

39:55.980 --> 39:58.940
What could they do between now and launch day to win you back?

39:58.940 --> 40:00.580
Do we have time for me to list it?

40:00.580 --> 40:03.700
Sure, take a couple if you've got it.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.640
Well, okay. First of all, drop the price.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.400
Take out all of the unnecessary shit.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.760
Take out the gyroscope. We don't fucking need it.

40:11.760 --> 40:16.300
You know, we don't need high def that not every system is going to be able to manage.

40:16.300 --> 40:20.900
We don't need two HDMI ports. Maybe one HDMI port.

40:20.900 --> 40:23.820
You know, enough to, you know, because how many people are going to hook up two HDMI ports?

40:23.820 --> 40:26.820
I think they only have one now. They did scale it back to one.

40:26.820 --> 40:31.860
Okay good. Leaving the HDMI. Allow me to point out that the low-end system will not even

40:31.860 --> 40:33.100
have the HDMI at all.

40:33.100 --> 40:36.140
I know this. I wouldn't waste my money on a

40:36.140 --> 40:40.460
low-end system. But they need to

40:40.460 --> 40:43.500
you know the memory stick thing? It's nice

40:43.500 --> 40:46.700
but they should have made them use the memory sticks from the beginning

40:46.700 --> 40:50.620
or a USB thing you know they should have had something

40:50.620 --> 40:54.020
more universal that would last if their vision was that big they should have had

40:54.020 --> 40:55.260
it last from system to system

40:55.260 --> 40:59.140
or they should at very least use the PS2 memory cards you know

40:59.140 --> 41:03.300
there's price reduction right there. They don't need

41:03.300 --> 41:06.280
to process the polys that they're saying that they can

41:06.280 --> 41:10.460
no one is really gonna care you know they need to make sure

41:10.460 --> 41:13.500
the games they put on there first of all take care of the whole

41:13.500 --> 41:16.620
anti-aliasing issue that you've had ever since the days of the PS1

41:16.620 --> 41:20.220
you know fix that you know

41:20.220 --> 41:22.220
Oh God, I've got such a list in my head right now.

41:22.220 --> 41:23.820
That's right, Loki wouldn't interject anyway.

41:23.820 --> 41:26.120
There is something else I like about the PlayStation 2.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.420
The old controllers worked on the system.

41:28.420 --> 41:31.220
I bought the system, I spent the $300 or whatever,

41:31.220 --> 41:33.920
and I did not have to go out and buy new hookups.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.220
It used the same hookups as the PlayStation 1.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.120
I didn't have to buy new controllers.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.520
You know, granted it came with one, but I didn't have to go out and buy a second one.

41:41.520 --> 41:42.920
You know, to play two-player games.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.420
I had that already because I already owned the system.

41:46.020 --> 41:49.120
Granted, Devil's Advocate, Xbox 360 didn't do that for you.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.120
No, it didn't.

41:50.120 --> 41:53.480
Yeah, you can use your Xbox controllers. No, you can't, no.

41:53.480 --> 41:57.440
Because it's USB. You have a 360 USB. That's right, that's right.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.560
Okay, that's great though. That's what I liked about it. I didn't say they'd have to do that

42:00.560 --> 42:03.560
for the PlayStation 3, but it just...

42:03.560 --> 42:06.860
First thing they need to do, stop doing gimmicky shit.

42:06.860 --> 42:10.920
I mean, granted I can say that about Nintendo too, but Nintendo at least is trying

42:10.920 --> 42:11.480
things that

42:11.480 --> 42:15.520
could possibly work. Whereas, like for example, F1 racing for

42:15.520 --> 42:20.000
the PS3 has used the wing mirror basically as the PSP.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.920
is a wing mirror you don't need that that is a stupid example of the

42:23.920 --> 42:24.800
technology

42:24.800 --> 42:28.720
stupid. I'm going to ask one more question then I want to get back to the news because we

42:28.720 --> 42:31.740
spent an awful lot of time on this unplanned Sony discussion but here's

42:31.740 --> 42:34.960
here's my last thought. Should

42:34.960 --> 42:39.120
Sony push back the release of this to save themselves yes or no?

42:39.120 --> 42:43.960
They're going to have to I think. Just right now given the level of technology

42:43.960 --> 42:45.220
they're trying to fit into that

42:45.220 --> 42:50.140
little box that they had as a demo. I mean, they were obviously running off of the right

42:50.140 --> 42:53.380
mounted servers. How are they going to fit that in there without having serious cooling

42:53.380 --> 42:53.880
issues?

42:53.880 --> 42:57.540
Are they done for if they push it back? Should they not even...

42:57.540 --> 43:03.840
They've already screwed themselves. Pushing them back. Honestly, I don't know if it will

43:03.840 --> 43:06.540
hurt or help them because they have already screwed themselves over.

43:06.540 --> 43:07.240
Alright, Loki?

43:07.240 --> 43:10.100
I think it's going to be a big mistake if they don't push it out by Christmas and the

43:10.100 --> 43:16.500
The reason why is because you've got the strong Xbox third quarter, or fourth quarter, basically

43:16.500 --> 43:23.900
all these big name games, the must have killer app games, Forza 2, Gears of War, and just

43:23.900 --> 43:27.260
a lot of really big stuff that's coming out for the 360.

43:27.260 --> 43:31.880
If you delay it any further, like into spring, people are already going to be snapping up

43:31.880 --> 43:36.620
the Xbox 360 and they'll say to hell with the PS3.

43:36.620 --> 43:40.500
Although, if they do launch PS3 now, you're going to get a lot of unfinished games, you're

43:40.500 --> 43:44.860
going to get a lot of things that may not work right, and it's going to be one big clusterfuck.

43:44.860 --> 43:49.940
It's going to be kind of like the Xbox 360 launch was, you know, to a greater extent

43:49.940 --> 43:50.940
though.

43:50.940 --> 43:55.060
And, I don't know, we'll have to see if maybe they've been, you know, playing it down that

43:55.060 --> 43:58.660
they really are, you know, ready to launch this thing, but I don't know.

43:58.660 --> 44:02.420
Alright, I'm going to run down some quick chat comments here in our chatroom, orangeonstrader.com,

44:02.420 --> 44:03.420
click on chat.

44:03.420 --> 44:09.660
28 says ps3 in 2006 I'll eat my hat if that happens let's see Legend of Zaku

44:09.660 --> 44:14.340
says they need it to live or Nintendo will eat them alive Boy Wonder Zero says

44:14.340 --> 44:20.020
they can't do it bandit says this the PlayStation 3 is to next gen for this

44:20.020 --> 44:28.220
gen hmm and Sakurina says recap fuck next generation consoles go retro okay

44:28.220 --> 44:31.500
well I guess that the Dreamcast is having a resurgence from what I

44:31.500 --> 44:36.260
But anyway, we need to get back into some more news here, so let's keep it on moving

44:36.260 --> 44:37.260
here.

44:37.260 --> 44:38.980
Loki, you have some news on the Wii.

44:38.980 --> 44:45.260
Yes, also basically one of the big things about the Wii was that this Wii Connect 24

44:45.260 --> 44:49.100
service that they're going to be having, they'll basically allow you to have updates.

44:49.100 --> 44:53.060
Some of the things that they're talking about is daily content, and this can be anything

44:53.060 --> 45:00.460
from DS demos to movies, etc.

45:00.460 --> 45:06.000
basically new content each day for you. I think that's great. I don't think that's going

45:06.000 --> 45:12.240
to happen. That's maybe a bit optimistic, but definitely I like the idea of having DS

45:12.240 --> 45:16.240
demos on there so you can actually play that. That's pretty cool. That's something that

45:16.240 --> 45:22.720
Sony should copy, to be honest. I mean, PS3 downloadable demos, that'd be a really good

45:22.720 --> 45:23.720
thing.

45:23.720 --> 45:28.360
So hopefully, the other thing though is, I mean, granted there's only limited storage

45:28.360 --> 45:32.600
on this thing, hopefully they'll have some way to turn this off in case you don't want

45:32.600 --> 45:37.700
it because it's going to fill up your hard drive or flash memory pretty quick.

45:37.700 --> 45:42.660
Alright, now there's another console to consider in the whole next generation wars that we've

45:42.660 --> 45:44.100
kind of forgot about it.

45:44.100 --> 45:46.600
It kind of hasn't been there, right DarkSakura?

45:46.600 --> 45:49.920
Forgetting about it, we should still forget about it, I'm surprised this is even still

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
being considered.

45:50.920 --> 45:55.920
Infinium is saying the Phantom is still going to launch.

45:55.920 --> 46:02.000
are still moving forward in development, that's a quote, and they are licensing to PC manufacturers

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
right now.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.480
And we set up our launch title as Duke Nukem Forever.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.480
Might sell some systems.

46:09.480 --> 46:15.120
But it's supposed to be actually an on-demand game service to deliver the games to the system

46:15.120 --> 46:18.960
in the living room through online means.

46:18.960 --> 46:24.280
So correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like GameTap on your TV, in a way, but not with

46:24.280 --> 46:26.080
classic titles, but with new games.

46:26.080 --> 46:27.280
That's what it's looking like.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.280
Huh.

46:28.280 --> 46:33.200
But they've changed their launch date now from mid-2006 to October.

46:33.200 --> 46:38.600
Their new CEO is basically going in saying that they're really pushing it.

46:38.600 --> 46:44.900
They're trying to get the Phantom lap board out, which is a combination keyboard and mouse.

46:44.900 --> 46:50.060
And they're saying it's on schedule for first arrivals in October for the U.S. market.

46:50.060 --> 46:55.020
right now they're running at uh... seventy million dollar loss

46:55.020 --> 46:58.380
you know maybe the product created maybe this is why nintendo's afraid to

46:58.380 --> 47:01.260
announce the launch date for the week as they're shaking in their boots over this

47:01.260 --> 47:04.460
phantom launch i mean this is that's a hell of a split

47:04.460 --> 47:05.560
no i know

47:05.560 --> 47:07.660
here's what they needed to do with the phantom

47:07.660 --> 47:11.420
if you really want to put this out and actually be successful with it and

47:11.420 --> 47:15.820
you're talking about on-demand service why don't you do like pitch it

47:15.820 --> 47:19.660
to cable companies cable companies now are starting to do this you know

47:19.660 --> 47:24.380
on-demand crap where you can download movies and karaoke and stuff like that

47:24.380 --> 47:25.460
why not games?

47:25.460 --> 47:29.460
Just, you know, soup up their hardware right now and offer games

47:29.460 --> 47:32.980
where you can download them on-demand play. Hey, you want to know something weird?

47:32.980 --> 47:35.860
Cable companies did this in the eighties and I don't know if it was something that was just

47:35.860 --> 47:39.580
being tested locally in this market but my cable box back in like

47:39.580 --> 47:43.280
back when the only system we had was like the Atari 2600 this is before the

47:43.280 --> 47:45.440
launch of the NES, we were talking about that long ago

47:45.440 --> 47:49.920
you could get games on demand like poker and stuff that had better graphics

47:49.920 --> 47:50.760
entire choice is hundred

47:50.760 --> 47:53.920
and use your remote and that never for some reason I never took off I don't

47:53.920 --> 47:54.160
know

47:54.160 --> 47:58.960
remember the Satellaview? No, I didn't have that. Well the Satellaview is what they had in

47:58.960 --> 48:03.720
Japan for the Super Nintendo. Oh, okay. The Zelda Satellaview which is actually

48:03.720 --> 48:07.240
in my opinion the best version of the first Zelda game ever.

48:07.240 --> 48:10.960
I remember back in the day when they had the Sega channel and that was okay

48:10.960 --> 48:14.760
but it was slow as hell. Nowadays though with everything being broadband I think they

48:14.760 --> 48:17.400
should do that. They do this in hotel rooms right now too.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.840
Oh yeah, I see chat rooms. They have Xbox Arcade.

48:19.840 --> 48:23.640
It's the same difference.

48:23.640 --> 48:26.840
But I think that's something that they should really do because in that way, you know,

48:26.840 --> 48:30.240
I don't want to buy a game console but you know maybe this game service where

48:30.240 --> 48:33.600
GameTap should fucking go in the business with these people and you know

48:33.600 --> 48:37.280
I think that'd be good too but I don't know.

48:37.280 --> 48:41.200
It's really where they need to be going because the Phantom console has like a PC

48:41.200 --> 48:42.320
on-demand thing

48:42.320 --> 48:46.440
people have done it for cheaper and better so

48:46.440 --> 48:51.640
yeah. Alright, well let's keep it moving here. I want to talk about the ESRB for a

48:51.640 --> 48:52.080
minute

48:52.080 --> 48:56.520
Penny Arcade is actually teaming up with ESRB. This is kind of interesting

48:56.520 --> 49:00.520
Gabe from Penny Arcade wrote that they have been signed by the ESRB to put

49:00.520 --> 49:02.880
together a new advertising campaign

49:02.880 --> 49:07.560
meant to educate gamers about the ESRB's rating systems. It's going to show up in

49:07.560 --> 49:09.840
magazines and websites and all that stuff

49:09.840 --> 49:12.920
Um, I think that's kind of interesting. I like...

49:12.920 --> 49:17.160
Penny Arcade has a very funny approach to social issues sometimes, so I'll be very

49:17.160 --> 49:20.400
curious to see what they come up with for this ESRB. I think it'll be very

49:20.400 --> 49:21.360
creative.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.560
There's some very creative guys over there. Well, you remember they actually had a kind of

49:24.560 --> 49:28.280
little thing teasing at it at E3. You probably saw those, um,

49:28.280 --> 49:32.240
pillars that they had with the characters. So, I think

49:32.240 --> 49:36.280
any way to get the message out there is great. I mean, especially if,

49:36.280 --> 49:39.960
you know it's something that you know parents can be able to use and so there's

49:39.960 --> 49:41.680
less confusion on

49:41.680 --> 49:45.080
the ratings. Because I remember they have that kind of like movie theaters, you know the little cartoon

49:45.080 --> 49:46.160
thing showing what each

49:46.160 --> 49:49.400
you know rating means and stuff. Right. I think that would be

49:49.400 --> 49:53.040
a pretty good thing. Or even like you know TV commercials, how they have like TV

49:53.040 --> 49:55.280
commercials talking about the TV ratings.

49:55.280 --> 49:59.520
Probably a good thing. Blaze would like to point out in her chat room the gamers understand

49:59.520 --> 50:02.200
how the ESRB works is the parents that need to be educated.

50:02.200 --> 50:05.400
Yeah. So let's hope whatever they're working on is you know kind of

50:05.400 --> 50:10.120
geared towards parents but I would say if it's educated if it's aimed at

50:10.120 --> 50:15.120
gamers talking to parents about what they're playing I think that's not a bad

50:15.120 --> 50:19.160
thing either but I don't know that would be kind of a hard thing to market but

50:19.160 --> 50:21.520
you know at Penny Arcade they're creative they can come up with something

50:21.520 --> 50:27.920
I'm sure moving on let's go on over to Loki who has news on another video game

50:27.920 --> 50:34.880
law yep and this one's in it's been passed in Minnesota their last latest

50:34.880 --> 50:41.640
state law is basically finding, and this is interesting, finding the people that buy the

50:41.640 --> 50:46.640
game and not the sellers of the games. So basically if you're a miner and you live in

50:46.640 --> 50:52.200
Minnesota and you happen to purchase an emirated game, well the blame is going to fall in your

50:52.200 --> 50:55.200
hands. You're going to be fined $25 for that.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.200
That's smart.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.200
I think it's a great idea.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.640
That's the right approach to take because really whose responsibility is it? It's the

51:01.640 --> 51:05.800
person who's paying out the money, they want the product, the game retailer, why should

51:05.800 --> 51:08.600
they parent other people's children for them?

51:08.600 --> 51:11.160
So I'm fully in support of that.

51:11.160 --> 51:16.680
Basically they're saying that they're not trying to punish gamers and basically if you

51:16.680 --> 51:22.200
do get caught doing this and get fined, it would not go on your record, it's just you'd

51:22.200 --> 51:24.120
be fined $25.

51:24.120 --> 51:26.880
The other thing though is they're saying that they don't know how they're going to enforce

51:26.880 --> 51:30.900
it, which is, I don't know, it's interesting, I think it's the right approach to punish

51:30.900 --> 51:36.660
the people buying the games, or maybe even the parents, you know, because, I don't know,

51:36.660 --> 51:39.980
maybe the fine should be, well, I don't know if it's a little bit too, you know, the right

51:39.980 --> 51:45.340
price point or not, maybe a little bit higher of a fine would be a bit better, but I guess

51:45.340 --> 51:50.100
it's sort of a step in the right direction, instead of, you know, just trying to say,

51:50.100 --> 51:53.220
oh, let's ban all bad video games type thing.

51:53.220 --> 51:59.820
Alright, speaking of bad things and games doing bad things to children, an affiliate

51:59.820 --> 52:07.100
of Fox, a Fox 9 TV station, further proving that the media does not get games sometimes.

52:07.100 --> 52:12.720
They ran a story recently that talked about how children are using a game device to access

52:12.720 --> 52:15.020
porn out of thin air.

52:15.020 --> 52:19.780
The gaming device in question, the PSP, and of course, if you consider that the PSP can

52:19.780 --> 52:24.940
access the internet and that if you listen to Avenue Q, the internet is for porn, this

52:24.940 --> 52:28.880
does not make any surprise at all that you can download porn on your PSP.

52:28.880 --> 52:32.100
This kind of reminds me of that other story that ran out that long ago about how you know

52:32.100 --> 52:38.420
predators can pick up children in PictoChat whereas I never find people chatting in PictoChat.

52:38.420 --> 52:41.460
This is just kind of one of those, is this really news?

52:41.460 --> 52:46.660
I mean if you really understand that the PSP gets on the internet and you can get anything

52:46.660 --> 52:50.760
on the internet, you probably can't just get porn pictures on the internet.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.300
You could get crazy stuff, pictures too.

52:53.300 --> 52:57.980
You could get Tub Girl on the PSP if you really wanted it, although I hope you don't want

52:57.980 --> 52:59.300
download that crap

52:59.300 --> 53:00.820
yeah right

53:00.820 --> 53:03.020
so whatever media

53:03.020 --> 53:04.460
stop trying to

53:04.460 --> 53:05.580
sell all that

53:05.580 --> 53:08.300
sensationalist stuff fair and balanced

53:08.300 --> 53:12.940
well you know what it's easy to blame fox and use that whole thing but really

53:12.940 --> 53:14.220
uh...

53:14.220 --> 53:18.780
i think there's a lot of uneducated media folks out there in general i think

53:18.780 --> 53:22.740
it's easy to pick on fox in this case but my favorite though was the uh...

53:22.740 --> 53:26.760
penny arcade response to the whole thing over there with a calculator the edge

53:26.760 --> 53:30.300
There's a sketch in the calculator.

53:30.300 --> 53:33.900
Your calculator can say boobs, which is something else.

53:33.900 --> 53:38.420
Speaking of porn, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down all day long for

53:38.420 --> 53:39.420
porn.

53:39.420 --> 53:40.420
Hey!

53:40.420 --> 53:45.500
But once in a while she stumbles upon a site she wants to share with you in a little segment

53:45.500 --> 53:48.180
we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

53:48.180 --> 53:51.100
DarkSakura, where should the kids be surfing to this week?

53:51.100 --> 53:56.220
Today's Website of the Week is, I actually had one and then there was another one that

53:56.220 --> 54:00.180
I have found earlier that I'm going to stick with because of the article I found on it.

54:00.180 --> 54:05.620
It's at Livescience.com. If you're going to this URL, it's Livescience.com slash technology

54:05.620 --> 54:13.100
slash 050201 underscore cell underscore danger dot HTML. Basically, it's talking about how

54:13.100 --> 54:17.700
drivers on cell phones kill thousands of people. Yeah, this is what I've been trying to point

54:17.700 --> 54:24.640
out to people forever. And when I found this article, I was like, finally statistics. Basically,

54:24.640 --> 54:28.600
If you are a 20-year-old driver behind the wheel of a cell phone, your reaction time

54:28.600 --> 54:32.240
is the same as a 70-year-old driver who is not using a cell phone.

54:32.240 --> 54:34.720
Basically, you drive like an old man if you're on your cell phone.

54:34.720 --> 54:37.240
All the more reason to take old people off the road.

54:37.240 --> 54:41.880
Cell phone distractions cause 2,600 deaths and 330,000 injuries in the United States

54:41.880 --> 54:46.800
every year, according to the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

54:46.800 --> 54:52.320
Drivers talking on cell phones are 18% slower to react to brake lights, and they're also

54:52.320 --> 54:57.080
12% greater following distance, at least that's one thing good, but they also took 17% longer

54:57.080 --> 55:01.520
to regain speed once they had braked.

55:01.520 --> 55:06.000
Basically it slows down your reaction time, it makes you a danger to yourself and everybody

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
else on the road.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.040
So I suggest that everybody read this article and hang up your god damn phone, so everyone

55:12.040 --> 55:14.920
should read this, this is my side of the week.

55:14.920 --> 55:19.080
Alright, and if you want to call me to talk about this, I'll be driving to the bay tonight,

55:19.080 --> 55:21.440
so I'll have plenty of time to talk.

55:21.440 --> 55:26.040
kidding I'm too serious about it I think it's it's actually having known someone

55:26.040 --> 55:29.440
who lost her child because the other driver was talking on her cell phone

55:29.440 --> 55:35.640
once you ran him over then yeah I definitely am very much against it all

55:35.640 --> 55:41.320
right going back to games now Loki and can the continuing saga of the Wii

55:41.320 --> 55:44.920
release date you know what I think is interesting if you check dig calm out

55:44.920 --> 55:48.360
this week some story that was speculating like a November 11th launch

55:48.360 --> 55:54.160
or something got like a thousand digs or something, and it kind of struck me as amazing, not to

55:54.160 --> 56:01.160
knock the story, but their source was kind of like some guy anonymously told us.

56:01.160 --> 56:05.680
I realize that our source to some people doesn't seem much better and that's fine, but I was

56:05.680 --> 56:12.280
just kind of surprised that everybody seemed to be jumping at that date based off of shaky

56:12.280 --> 56:13.280
evidence.

56:13.280 --> 56:17.440
Well, Loki has further evidence that seems to point towards October, take it with a grain

56:17.440 --> 56:18.720
assault if you want, but here it is.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.200
And I'd like to preface something real quick.

56:20.200 --> 56:25.440
I saw there was a little story on GameSpot this week talking about Activision's upcoming

56:25.440 --> 56:31.240
titles for the fourth quarter, including some titles like Pimp My Ride the Game, and some

56:31.240 --> 56:38.400
Cavalla's Alaskan Hunt game or something like that, and other stuff.

56:38.400 --> 56:42.440
You do remember way back when I talked about this months ago.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.440
I do.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.680
When was that one event?

56:45.680 --> 56:49.880
It was during Destination PlayStation in Florida. They announced all this stuff.

56:49.880 --> 56:55.360
Did anyone pay attention to that? No. When they showed the week of Destination PlayStation,

56:55.360 --> 56:57.200
we did. You'll hear a local saying this.

56:57.200 --> 57:02.080
And seriously, I get this information, you know, and nobody pays attention to it

57:02.080 --> 57:05.660
until like a big site comes and repeats the same thing and then everyone's like,

57:05.660 --> 57:08.980
oh, okay. So anyways, more we dates, of course,

57:08.980 --> 57:13.740
and guess what? They're all around the same time again. And this time we've got Activision

57:13.740 --> 57:17.420
and Ubisoft, and a little bit bigger companies out there should know when the Wii's coming

57:17.420 --> 57:25.060
out. Granted some of their games though, like for example, Call of Duty 3, that is on the

57:25.060 --> 57:30.500
launch date, which is great. I didn't even know Call of Duty was coming to the Wii. Oh,

57:30.500 --> 57:35.220
I mentioned that also on that same podcast about Destination PlayStation. Why didn't

57:35.220 --> 57:40.540
they show that at E3? They did. Sort of, in movie form. It was like, it was a pre-rendered

57:40.540 --> 57:46.080
movie it was like eh, but okay, not on the Wii, but they were showing it on other consoles.

57:46.080 --> 57:51.420
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, that one is coming out the week after launch on October 26th,

57:51.420 --> 57:54.980
of course, you know, not everything coming out on the launch date.

57:54.980 --> 58:01.940
And then Rayman 4 is coming out day and date with all the systems on the, what was it,

58:01.940 --> 58:03.740
November 1st.

58:03.740 --> 58:08.900
And then Marvel Ultimate Alliance also coming out actually to coincide with the Playstation

58:08.900 --> 58:15.700
free launch because that's being launched on every single system that day on November

58:15.700 --> 58:22.700
16th. So there's some more games for you. Granted not all of them are on October 18th

58:22.700 --> 58:27.000
but I think we still haven't gotten a lot of the company's stuff yet and obviously

58:27.000 --> 58:31.320
you know you're not going to be just announcing stuff for launch. You're going to be launching

58:31.320 --> 58:34.960
with more titles. It's still within the launch window and it's about a week away

58:34.960 --> 58:41.960
from the thing. I'm still sticking with October 18th and I will be laughing my ass off when

58:42.600 --> 58:45.700
this does come out on October 18th or when they come out with the news that we're launching

58:45.700 --> 58:48.980
on the anniversary of the original Nintendo. Okay, what if it doesn't turn out that way

58:48.980 --> 58:51.900
though? What if they do come out and say it's November 11th? What are you going to do? Well

58:51.900 --> 58:55.740
then good, it's coming out November 11th. But you know what? I think it's coming out

58:55.740 --> 59:02.740
this date and granted there's powers that may not be able to make it at this launch

59:02.740 --> 59:06.020
at this launch date you know things can delay stuff but

59:06.020 --> 59:07.380
it's too convenient

59:07.380 --> 59:10.580
not to happen i mean

59:10.580 --> 59:14.300
there's too many coincidences seriously and

59:14.300 --> 59:19.340
with you know more and more publishers every day every week you know agreeing

59:19.340 --> 59:22.540
that this is the time frame notice all these dates aren't all in november

59:22.540 --> 59:25.220
they're not all hovering around in november

59:25.220 --> 59:28.300
like it would be coming out in november so it's definitely okay

59:28.300 --> 59:30.460
definitely in october

59:30.460 --> 59:32.900
and most likely on the 18th

59:32.900 --> 59:34.140
alright

59:34.140 --> 59:35.300
we'll see

59:35.300 --> 59:39.580
uh... dark soccer now you have some definite for sure release dates to share

59:39.580 --> 59:43.940
with us correct? I sure do! But now this isn't for the U.S., these are for the U.K.

59:43.940 --> 59:46.920
Cause screw the U- I mean

59:46.920 --> 59:50.260
you do live here. I know, dammit. Alright, okay

59:50.260 --> 59:51.100
uh...

59:51.100 --> 59:55.220
this is uh... the release dates for our U.K. listeners um... coming up on the

59:55.220 --> 59:57.220
ninth of the following games

59:57.220 --> 01:00:01.900
we have Zoo Tycoon 2, oh sorry, that was the second

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.660
F11-7A Stealth Fighter on PC is coming out

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.900
Namco Museum 50th Anniversary on GameCube

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:12.940
Sensible Soccer 2006 on PC, Xbox, PlayStation 2

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.500
and Talkman on PSP

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:21.000
also on the 13th we have Kolpa Inata on PC

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.980
that's going to be the following Monday

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.020
Alright, Loki, do you have anything in the US?

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:30.900
Yeah, there's lots of fun stuff coming out this coming week here.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.900
Of course, actually, you know, it's kind of getting to a dead part of the month, Urban

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:41.540
Chaos Riot Response is supposed to be coming out, actually that will be the following week.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.780
This week, though, we have Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories on PlayStation 2, and

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.940
that should be good, unfortunately there isn't multiplayer on it, so that kind of sucks.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:56.780
But also we've got Ant-One Street Ball coming out on Playstation 2 and Xbox, I believe I

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:02.460
talked about this last week, Gradius Collection is going to be coming out on the PSP, which

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.460
is pretty awesome.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.220
And then of course like I said the following week, Urban Chaos Right Response on Playstation

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:15.740
2 and Xbox, and the Streetfire Alpha Anthology on the Playstation 2 as well.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.780
And unfortunately if you're waiting for 360 games, there's only going to be one this month

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:23.140
and that would be MotoGP 2006.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:28.580
Hopefully there'll be some more Xbox Live games, arcade games to go with that.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.980
Hopefully Luminous, I'm hoping.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.980
Hopefully anything.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.460
Live's been kind of dead since E3 with UNO.

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.700
All you need is UNO.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.660
Well, UNO's really the only game that's really come out in quite a while, and I realize UNO

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:44.900
is a pretty good release, but after hearing some of the stuff they teased at E3, I'm like,

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.220
come on, bring on the Contra, bring on the Luminous.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.100
Well I've got a few more things real quick because there's been some shuffling going

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.100
around obviously.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.100
DDR has been moving.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.100
Oh really?

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.100
DDR moved.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.100
What happened?

01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:04.100
Well the updates changed so let's get caught up here with what's been going on.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:12.960
DDR Supernova not coming out on the 13th but coming out on the 2nd now of September so

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
that's pretty good.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.960
Alright.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:24.160
up a bit, and of course Supernova, also I believe moved up, and it's now coming out,

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:32.920
let's see here, it was in October, actually also one game that did get delayed, Final

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.800
Fantasy XII, coming out on October 11th now, so that kind of sucks.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:46.400
Wait a minute, wait a minute, could that be something else to show that there's competition

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.760
with the Wii there?

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.440
Because didn't Dragon Quest VIII get shuffled to come out right on the same day as the Xbox

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440
360?

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.440
Maybe?

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440
I don't know.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.440
Interesting.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.400
It wasn't a very good, yeah, it wasn't very good to...

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.720
But Final Fantasy XII is a great counter title.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.720
That's okay.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.720
Interesting.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
I'm sorry.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720
Not Super...

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:13.020
Ultimax 4, October 2nd now, so that got pushed up a little bit, same day as Elibits, so that's

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.480
kind of cool.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:29.240
And then of course we have for the 360 universe, which is now November 2nd, and so yeah, they're

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.560
really aiming on the 2nd for a lot of these, but lots of good games coming out though in

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.400
the fall that's for sure.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.480
kind of weird. Why would they all get shifted to the second? Are those all even Tuesdays?

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.760
Why would they do that? They don't come out on Tuesdays. It's usually

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:47.800
Wednesdays and stuff. Are you sure it's not going to change again

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.160
next week? I'm never certain about dates until it actually

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:58.000
gets to the week of and even then I'm not certain sometimes.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.720
When it comes down to Konami, they tend to really keep about the same dates for stuff.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.680
if they announce a game that's coming out in September on a certain week, it usually

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.480
won't shift around too much. So I'm pretty confident those are going to be the dates.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:16.240
Alright, well we'll see. DarkSakura, going back to the UK for a little bit, do you have

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.160
some information about what's selling over there?

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.640
I've got the chart information. Apparently right up at the top of the list is Hitman

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:32.600
Blood Money and second place we have World Cup Germany 2006 put out by Eidos

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:38.520
there's actually a couple of the other games on here that they're working on

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.720
is actually the championship manager 2006 is actually at number nine fourth

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.640
place there's Rockstar Games table tennis that you were talking about

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:53.520
out playing last week yep and tomb raider legend is at number five six

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.700
place x-men the official game da vinci code is at eight animal crossing

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:02.320
wild world that at number seven that actually moved up from number nine and

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.520
Sims 2 is and number 10 some of the debuts that came out though was rise of

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:14.940
nations rise of legends at 37 super princess peach at 29 basically DS titles

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:21.300
though all over the place um they're speculating that uh the new super mario brothers is gonna

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:29.100
really show up high as well as uh brain training so that's how it's looking right now apparently

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.740
they love hitman all right oh it is new they mentioned in chat that september 2nd is saturday

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:39.160
i i i don't know about that loki i think some somebody made a booboo yeah maybe over there

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.780
so i take that with a huge grain of salt i think it's gonna go back to the way it was

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.660
next week. So just goes to show your database is not always foolproof.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:52.460
It's not, but they're pretty close. Top Xbox 360 and Xbox Live

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:56.420
games are out thanks to Major Nelson. You want to know what folks are playing on the 360?

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.100
The number one game, Call of Duty 2. Number two, Ghost Recon 3. Number three,

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.260
Oblivion.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:05.580
All the way on down to number ten, Hitman Blood Money demo, making a new entry

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.700
there on the chart. Rockstar Table Tennis coming in at number seven.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.900
uh... the top games on the original xbox number one halo 2 of course

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.860
number two battlefield 2 and number three counter strike

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.600
all the way on down to uh... ghost recon 2 at number 10

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.540
the rest the titles not a lot of new stuff there on the original xbox

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:30.380
alright uh... i want to share with you guys a story coming in from japan we're

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.280
talking about the ESRB earlier

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.920
well the CERO is japan's equivalent

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.420
and they have a new rating system that they're gonna use.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:43.560
They have two separate ratings for M-type games, okay?

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.520
A title gets what's called a D,

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.440
basically there's letters, A, B, C, D, and Z.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.240
A title gets a D rating if it's 17 years and older,

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:57.400
and the Z rating is for adults 18 and up,

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.500
so that's kind of interesting.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.800
If you wanna know the type of games

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.280
that are getting a Z rating right now,

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:10.920
You have Killer7, Max Payne, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, The Getaway, Berserk, D-rated games,

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:16.280
as in the 17 and older, you have things like Fable, Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive 4, God

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.120
of War, Rumble Roses, kind of interesting this system they have there.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.120
I like that.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:28.280
It's A, B, C, D, and Z, where I guess C is 15 and up and B is 12 and up and A is everybody.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:36.480
It's like the movie rating system because 15 is basically their equivalent of the PG-13.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:42.040
Like Battle Royale, for example, was a 15 and up movie.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:45.040
I always said for a long time we should just mirror the movie system here.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.480
I'm surprised that Berserk was mentioned being that that's an old Dreamcast title.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:54.200
And then again, though, it was a pretty violent anime and manga.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.600
Loki!

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.320
Are we going to be seeing gaming at the Olympics soon?

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.320
I hope not.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.700
But then again, I've seen weird stuff come to the Olympics, so who knows.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:09.000
But according to GameSpot actually, the founder of the Global Gaming League is trying to get

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.640
gaming as a demo sport in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:21.520
And basically has been discussing this with the Chinese government and the possibility

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.800
of having a gaming show at the Olympics.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:30.440
And if this happens, I guess, I don't know, they're trying to make gaming more viable.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.520
To be honest, I think they have a better chance of getting masturbation in the Olympics as

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:38.720
an event over gaming.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.680
Gaming is so sedentary, it's not even actually a sport.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.920
No.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.080
I don't want to see gaming as an Olympic event at all.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080
Really?

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.320
You don't think it would legitimize gaming or anything?

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.560
No, it's not a sport.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.360
Gaming doesn't need to be legitimized.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.080
okay it's not sport they don't have fucking poker

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.560
as an Olympic event okay can't play chess at the Olympics

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.600
okay so no

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.440
it's not event not at all unless they come out with a game

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.840
running your arm I'm track that is not

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.080
even close to being a sport okay if it was someone's athletic ability you've

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:17.480
got

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.040
the floor exercises for gymnastics DDR is nothing compared to that

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.040
Breakdancing would be a better sport than gaming.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:33.040
And of course we have the classic witty retort from the chatroom that DDR is a sport in the Netherlands, Norway.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040
Good for them.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040
Does that count?

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.040
Norway doesn't count.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040
Moving on.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.040
DarkSakura, you have some news on Half-Life.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.040
Do I? Well, you know what Half-Life is.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:10:01.160
that's what the notes say I know I know I Dark Sakura needs food badly don't

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:10.040
shoot food no um seriously half-life 2 episode 1 is out released in at 6 p.m.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:19.880
in the UK on a January sorry on a June 6th after June 1st sorry I'm all

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:28.840
backwards today basically it's uh it's out about people can play it and you

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:36.040
actually can they actually had it available for a pre-purchase as well too

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.560
but now you can pre-load it

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.760
for $19.95 or you can buy it

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.320
from scratch and download it. But right now though they're saying the servers

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.400
are pretty loaded on it.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.120
Okay. And for the record in the UK

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.920
EA is distributing the game for £15.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.200
Alrighty. Well if you don't want to have to pay anything

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.960
for your gaming fun. There's a simulation out that might be for you. It's called

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.600
Free Tar Hero. It's basically

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.120
to Guitar Hero what StepMania was to DDR.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.600
Free Tar Hero is released. It's available at a site.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.720
It's called, I'm going to have to spell this for you guys,

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:24.360
A-N-T-O-N-S-T-R-U-Y-K dot com

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.920
slash Free Tar, F-R-E-E-T-A-R.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:32.560
and basically what it is is a rhythm game of course based on Guitar Hero

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.360
and you can with according to the website create

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.960
edit and playback button timings for any song on your computer with any gamepad

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.900
like device

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.600
so essentially you can you know have a take an mp3

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.120
make your button pattern to it and you can play Guitar Hero to it and they

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.160
even posted some screenshots here on the site

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.560
however all you can really do right now is that

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.920
You can download, I think, the button editor, and then the game itself, I suppose, is going

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.240
to come out later.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240
So we'll see.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.100
But it's in the works.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.080
So if you've ever wanted to make your own Guitar Hero stuff, well, there's free

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.960
Guitar Hero.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.080
Loki, some things are being developed for an old platform.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.140
Yes, the Dreamcast, which is ironic because actually iGen's been doing this thing now

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:24.100
where they're re-revealing every single Dreamcast game that's ever been made and starting

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:31.100
off, you know, with a lot of games. But, according to Dreamcast Scene actually, Goat Store publishing

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:37.540
firm has announced that they have plans to release 10 more games for the Dreamcast over

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:43.280
the next year and a half. And that's great if, I mean, if you have a Dreamcast still.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.400
And there's actually, you know, a lot of stuff out there that you can download and burn that

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:54.400
that are homebrew, so definitely check it out, I mean, especially if you have a Dreamcast.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.400
You can get ROMs and all sorts of stuff. I think even when we talked about it a little

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:06.400
while back, they had, what was it, a marathon on the Dreamcast, which is pretty interesting.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.400
There's still a lot of love for the Dreamcast out there, so the fact that there's folks

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.400
out there, I mean, heck, if they could put out that game on the Genesis that Baker Prince

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.000
came out not that long ago. I'm sure the Dreamcast still has a lot of love for it too, so there's

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.960
always something going to be cooking for that system. Especially because it's so easy to

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.200
burn your own stuff and put it on there. I mean, Genesis takes a lot more work. That

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.440
Baker Prince probably had a lot of work that went into it, but Dreamcast is, you know,

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:35.200
it's kind of easy to bring on CD in comparison. In case you're wondering what games they will

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:42.200
be bringing, well here's some of the games right now and I don't know if these are going

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:49.160
to be too exciting, but Feet of Fury 2, remember that DDR clone that they had for the Dreamcast,

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:58.880
Donk, a Cryptic Illusions remake of the CDI game, Decastle, Age of the Beast Special Edition,

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:05.880
which is basically a clone of Altered, not Altered Beast, I can't remember, it's very

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.720
similar to that Beats of Rage that came out a while back, which is the Streets of Rage

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:20.020
An Amnesia adventure game, a new graphic adventure, a new adventure game from SF Software, a remake

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:28.040
of a Cancel Links game inspired by Tempest 2000, a new 3D fighter using the Quake engine,

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:37.920
Samurai Warrior using the enhanced Pizza Rage engine, and Project Firestorm Shmup, whatever

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920
the hell that's supposed to mean.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.380
best of luck to them

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.620
that's a pretty ambitious undertaking

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.620
alright we'll see how they turn out

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.900
uh... hopefully it won't get the cold reception that this is getting there was

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.180
a rom hack

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:52.980
i think that's what it is a rom hack i don't see what else this could be it's

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:56.180
super mario brothers 2.5D

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.400
and what they mean by that is that well it's not 3D but they kind of change the

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.800
graphics to give it a

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.720
kind of an ISO view a little bit like imagine you could turn the camera in the

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.040
original Super Mario Brothers

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.920
And they turned it to the side a little bit, giving everything a little bit of depth.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.240
Well that's what this whole release is all about.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.300
I didn't really have time to play it, so I checked out Kotaku's review, they have a review

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:20.480
on it there, one of their staffs reviewed it and said that they played it for about

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.480
30 seconds.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.080
Aside from being hideously ugly, the game is sort of floaty feeling, none of the snappiness

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.480
of the original, and the levels are not identical either, it's a cute idea but needs some serious

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480
work.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480
And so in case you're wondering where you...

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480
That's according to Kotaku.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:41.840
want to know where you can download this, right? www.plunder.com slash super dash mario

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:52.360
dash b r o s dash 2 dash 5 d dash d l 3 3 9 0 dot h t m. This doesn't sound like something

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.520
I'm exactly going to be running out and checking out. Yeah, so sorry to say, I'll have to try

01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:02.520
Alright, and I'll make a link in the chatroom, of course.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:08.080
Alrighty, let's go on now to, oh, I saved the best for the last for this break.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.520
Loki, you have a story about Mac fans.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.680
Yes, I do.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.680
I love this.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:24.080
No, but anyways, according to Business Week, don't hate me, but anyways, according to a

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:31.360
Business Week article, they say that there is a lack of games available for the Mac and

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:39.320
asked, why doesn't Apple try its hand at building good games for the Mac on its own? And well,

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:50.320
their answer, Mac users aren't really into games. And so, yeah, we're not quite sure,

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.320
I don't know if they entirely addresses the state of Mac gaming, but

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.820
Yeah, that's why Mac users don't really like games

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.160
And that's according to who again it's according to business week

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:08.680
I'm just making sure you get your source out there when all the hate mail starts coming in for business week says you don't like

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.680
games

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.800
All right, not surprising

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:18.600
Rini in our chat room who I know is a Mac fan says, whoever wrote that isn't trying.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.160
They're not trying.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.160
Fuck you, Businessweek.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:28.400
All right, we're going to go to a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
