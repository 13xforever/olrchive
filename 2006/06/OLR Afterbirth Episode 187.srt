1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Weíre going to start tonightís AfterbirthÖ Nellie, get back in here Nellie right now.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,720
Nellie walked in here because she heard the outro going and she wanted to show Loki what

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
she bought.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,840
What did you get here?

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,320
Welcome to the Afterbirth by the way boys and girls, this stuff is too hot to podcast.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,680
What did you get here?

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,080
I got a pink helmet.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
A pink?

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Itís a bike helmet?

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,080
Yes.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Why?

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,480
Because Iím a Jordan and if I fall I donít want to hurt myself.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,020
You bought a pink bike helmet for no reason?

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,020
Yes.

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,420
I know, I bought it for a reason.

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,420
Why?

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,420
Hold on, I'll be right back.

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,420
I guess they can't see on the radio.

19
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,420
No, they can't see on the radio.

20
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,420
Who cares?

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,420
It's the afterbirth.

22
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
It's not the real show.

23
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,420
Tell Miklotov he needs to get in here too.

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,860
Miklotov is going to make his way back in here too.

25
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,860
You bought roller skates?

26
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,860
Yes, I don't know how to.

27
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,220
Hold on, we need to get her on mic.

28
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,220
You bought roller skates?

29
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,340
Yeah, I don't know how to do it, so Christopher was going to teach me.

30
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,060
and he tried to teach me a target but I almost fell on him. Why did you buy rollerblades?

31
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,980
She bought rollerblades. Now we're playing rollerblading though, because I have rollerblades in my trunk.

32
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,140
Watch your ankles though, because that will be hard on your ankles.

33
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,060
It'll probably be hard on a lot of things, that's why I need the helmet.

34
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,020
Because I'll fall on my butt.

35
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,220
I bought knee pads

36
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,260
and elbow bobbers. Christopher made me, I didn't want to.

37
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,620
But if she falls, she's gonna hurt somebody.

38
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,620
Uh-huh.

39
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,620
That's the whole point.

40
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,100
I wanted pillows for my entire body.

41
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,820
I wanted pillows for my entire body.

42
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,380
Cause I feel that's the safest.

43
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,460
Anybody want to go rollerblading with me?

44
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,460
I can do that.

45
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,820
I have rollerblades in my car.

46
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,460
Everybody's invited.

47
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
The more people to hold me.

48
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,660
Orange Launch Radio goes to the roller ring.

49
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,860
Actually I want to get like regular streetskates again cause I used to have streetskates.

50
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,220
I can't use in-lines because of my ankle because of my

51
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,020
an old injury I had to my ankle. Now they say I can have roller skating sex.

52
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,860
That's uh... That's not easy.

53
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,300
That's nice! That's very nice. Where's Mikotov? Is he here?

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,020
Where the hell is he? I know he was in the living room.

55
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,300
Is he playing Silent Hill with Annie? It is. I'm gonna go get him. You guys feel time.

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,340
That's a natural. All of these are so photoshopped.

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,980
It's pointing the wrong way.

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,040
It is.

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,380
Yeah. Either that or he's got problems.

60
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,660
So Nellie got Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy, for those who are not

61
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
aware, those are porno books.

62
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,900
I bought them! Including Beauty's Release, Beauty's Punishment, and the

63
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Claiming of Sleeping Beauty.

64
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,540
I've read the first one.

65
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,060
I know it's porno because she has a nipple showing on the front cover.

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,180
She wrote it under a pseudonym. It's not porno, it's erotica.

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:58,180
Miklotov was supposed to come on and yell at people who didn't like Bahmani in the U.S., but he pussied out, so forget what I said in chat. Sorry guys.

68
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,180
Not my fault though.

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,180
My name's Miklotov and I'm a big chicken.

70
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
Alright, I want to do Ask Anelli.

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Alright, fine. And you field the questions while I set up Cage Match here.

72
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,180
Feel free to ask questions.

73
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
And...

74
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
Go.

75
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,180
Now ask questions. This is new something. Ask Nelly a question.

76
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,180
Let's ask Nelly questions.

77
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Nelly, do you like your books?

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Yes, I love books.

79
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,180
Other than what?

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,180
You didn't play any other video games?

81
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,180
No. I don't play video games.

82
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,940
yes I played Tetris a little bit okay

83
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,700
but you got the level 16 number dual I know and 17 is the achievement and I've

84
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,140
lost

85
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,220
yes why did you earn me my damn achievement that's why I need to work

86
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,180
what do I keep cuz he beats me seriously if

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,380
please help if you can

88
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,020
questions

89
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,660
what did you have for dinner Nellie I had

90
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,300
um one of those for scottish sandwiches from wendy's it was the turkey and swiss

91
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,260
and i got it with no mayo and i got a side salad

92
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,580
with low-fat honey mustard dressing and a diet

93
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,940
coke and then christopher just gave me an apple because he's awesome

94
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,420
and um question and doesn't that the other question was have you ever gone

95
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,580
skydiving which i know is no and there's no questions for me you don't

96
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,500
speak for me you should have a brownie bite where

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,500
did the bad man touch you? Everywhere. That's about right. I eat whatever the crap I want

98
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,600
diet now. Nellie, what is your opinion on boobs? I love boobs. You know whose boobs

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,740
I really like? Jessica Alba's. She has a no nudity clause and that really sucks. That's

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,740
cause she's a biznatch. But I don't like what's her face? The redhead with the freckles? Lindsay

101
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,020
Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan, yes, because her nipple is on top, and that's just not right.

102
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,180
It's like on the top of the boob. She was cuter when she,

103
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,940
you know, more chubby and with the red hair. When she was a child.

104
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,540
Because you're a molester. I'm not a child molester.

105
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,780
Lester the molester. She's now, like, anorexic.

106
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,540
And though we're, uh, you know, stupid... Please, please don't joke.

107
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,980
Please don't joke about child molesting, not after the trial I went through this week.

108
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:44,860
And especially, okay, especially about, what was it, uh, Wilmer Valderrama, whatever, he

109
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,700
has a show on MTV called Yo Mama, to which I said, God damn it, you rip that off of In

110
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Living Color.

111
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,860
And the fact that he's producing this show, he's like, this is my greatest idea ever,

112
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,560
you know, and it's a dumb show to begin with, yet for some reason I watched the final today,

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,360
the best trash talker in LA and some retarded, like, white guy who, you know, thinks he's,

114
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,120
you know, black or something, and it's retarded. The funniest part of that show was that the

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,280
white guy got $5,000 in cash and he was surrounded by a bunch of blacks and Mexicans. I'm like,

116
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,760
he's not gonna keep that. He's gonna get mugged. Cause they're all behind him, looking at him,

117
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,760
I smell date-crime!

118
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
We gotta do the cage match. You wanna sit in on the cage match tonight?

119
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
No, I'm gonna go play with my new toys. Alright, have fun with your new toys. Thanks for coming on the show, Nellie.

120
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,720
We appreciate it. Thanks for having me! You're welcome! Bye everybody!

121
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,880
Alright, here we go! Orange Launcher to do the cage match.

122
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,200
Wow, that's loud. The way the cage match works is we put in three songs, so we put in

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,920
last week's winner in two new songs, and they do battle!

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,960
And in order for them to do battle appropriately, you must be in our chat room, orangeloungeradio.com,

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,520
click on chat, and you're going to vote for a winner, and the winner goes into rotation

126
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,000
all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's video game music program, which airs 24 hours a

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,320
day on the station.

128
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,720
We are not here, and there's no other live programming going on, such as Jamie's lovely

129
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,520
Tuesday night program, or my own Wednesday night program, which will not be heard this

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,960
week because I will be in LA.

131
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
Listen to all games instead, because I might make a cameo over there on Wednesday.

132
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Who knows?

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Uh, just depends on what I can arrange with work.

134
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,040
Anyway, let's get into tonight's cage match.

135
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,440
Song number one was last week's winner, and it comes to us from a little band.

136
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,320
You might have heard of it before.

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,560
Not because Jamie doesn't talk about it every week on the show or anything like that.

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Hey!

139
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
I don't.

140
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Well, it's true.

141
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Every other show.

142
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Every other show.

143
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Alright, here it is.

144
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
You voted it, it won.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Here's a clip of last week's winner.

146
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Song number one, the Gorillas!

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Happy Landfill!

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,560
You will, well, you ain't from United, no

149
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
So follow the light, take care of your eyes

150
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,560
You won't be even seeing and doing your lies

151
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Stand in front of a ship that should never be so

152
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,560
They put a dollar for me and I won't be home

153
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Wait on the happy lapel

154
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Wait on the happy lapel

155
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Alright!

156
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:39,200
All righty, song number one, Gorillaz with Happy Landfill.

157
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,720
It must successfully beat two new songs to a bloody pulp, and that first song is gonna

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,040
come from Loki.

159
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,240
What is your pick tonight?

160
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,880
My song is from Junkie XL again, but this time it's a collaboration with somebody else.

161
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:03,880
It's actually, um, pretty cool. It's called Nightmare. Or Nightmares, I believe. And, um, well, yeah, it's short. So that's always good.

162
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:15,880
And I think it sounds like a good, like, DDR song. Maybe even kind of almost similar to, oh, I wanna say, like, maybe Echo Image a little bit.

163
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,880
So this is, uh, Nightmares featuring Infusion.

164
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,280
all right here it is enjoy

165
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Looking across the stars

166
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Feeling, reflecting down the hills

167
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Watching the skies tonight

168
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:19,880
We lay down, it's all down the stairs

169
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Stand aside, stand aside, stand aside

170
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Swinging in the night of time

171
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Looking past the dangerous signs

172
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Broken crystal realized

173
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Losing color, losing shine

174
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Beautiful destructive art

175
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Holding gracefully apart

176
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Three rises in my head

177
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,880
We'll see the natures from the stars in the air

178
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Looking across the stars

179
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Feeling, reflecting down the hills

180
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Watching the skies tonight

181
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:31,880
We lay down, it's all down to stars

182
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Storm this life, storm this life, storm this life

183
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Singing in a matter of time

184
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,380
Looking past the dangerous signs

185
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,880
Looking close to realize

186
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,380
Losing color, losing shine

187
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,380
A beautiful destructive heart

188
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,880
Holding gracefully apart

189
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,380
Nothing rises in my head

190
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,380
Wishing ages from the start

191
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,180
What do you see in the mirror?

192
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Down the stairs

193
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Down the stairs

194
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:58,780
That was song number two tonight, that was Junkie XL with Nightmares featuring Infusion.

195
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,420
go around and see if that song gave us nightmares or very sweet dreams dark

196
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:13,100
Sakura I'm gonna agree same argument nine Loki it's short it's like three

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,960
here it is Weird Al Yankovic with Your Pitiful. Enjoy!

206
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:35,700
My life is brilliant Your life's a joke

207
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:45,820
You're just pathetic, you're always broke Your homemade Star Trek uniform really ain't

208
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:52,580
impressin' me You're sufferin' from delusions of adequacy

209
00:15:52,580 --> 00:16:05,580
You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true

210
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Never had a date that you couldn't inflate And you smell repulsive too

211
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,580
What a bummer being you

212
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Well you just can't dance and forget romance

213
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Everybody you know still calls you

214
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:52,580
Farty pants, but you always have a job Well, I mean, as long as you still could

215
00:16:52,580 --> 00:17:04,580
work that Slurpee machine You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful

216
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:14,580
You have fun dressed, eating chips off your chest

217
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:20,580
While you're playing Halo 2

218
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:27,580
No one's classier than you

219
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:38,580
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, loser

220
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:49,580
You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true

221
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:56,580
Your dog would much rather play fetch by itself

222
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,580
You still live with your mom and you're forty-two

223
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Guess you'll never grow a clue

224
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,580
When it just sucks to be you

225
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,580
It's been far too long since we've heard him. He is the man, is he not?

226
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
He's another album. Weird Al is the man.

227
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Love him.

228
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Gets a 10.

229
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Alright, let's recap so you guys can place your votes.

230
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580

Gorillaz, Happy Landfill.

232
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
And song number two you can vote for tonight

233
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:17,300
Tonight is Junkie XL with Nightmares featuring Infusion.

234
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,620
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Weird Al Yankovic with Your Pitiful.

235
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:32,900
Alright, place vote now.

236
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,980
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

237
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,820
We'll tally him up, and we'll see who the wiener is.

238
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,300
And I think I just heard DarkSakura say,

239
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,580
I hope I lose.

240
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,660
That's amazing.

241
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,700
Yep, I hope I lose.

242
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,200
All right.

243
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,660
You want a new song to put in next week,

244
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,780
or you just love Weird Al that much?

245
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
I love Weird Al the way it is.

246
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,940
Are you pissed I beat you to it?

247
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,300
Well, no, because I never think to go to Weird Al's site,

248
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,900
except when I'm looking for concerts.

249
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,600
I don't either.

250
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,180
You know how I found out about it?

251
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,740
DDR Freak, of all places.

252
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,140
Random chat, yo.

253
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,860
I do lurk on DDR Freak.

254
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,340
Yes, I do. I very rarely post, ever, but I probably visit it, like, every day and just

255
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,480
kind of read what the kids are saying.

256
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,120
I basically just, uh, since you just put that up there, I've basically linked it to, like,

257
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
seven people just now.

258
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,780
Oh, the new song, really?

259
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Download this!

260
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,440
That's great! Well, we'll see, we'll see. There seems to be some anti-Weird Al people

261
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
in our chat room, so I don't know.

262
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Okay.

263
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,260
I forgot to mention that I just saw this thing on IGN.

264
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,580
All right, tell us about it. That's good, because I can tally votes when I do that.

265
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,420
Hurry up and get your votes in now, because we don't have time to do it.

266
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,900
I actually have in my possession, and this is such a nerd of me, and we talked about

267
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,940
this a while ago, that they were getting sent out.

268
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,300
I have my Xbox Live diamond card.

269
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Aren't you special?

270
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,020
Great, now what the fuck can you do with it?

271
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I don't know.

272
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
Impale people in the head!

273
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,060
I can show people that I'm a member of Xbox Live!

274
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:29,260
I would just like to point out there are more votes in cage match tonight than I have ever

275
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,260
ever seen in the four-year history of this show.

276
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
It's crazy.

277
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,900
I'm having a hard time tallying this up.

278
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,020
You guys need to fill more time.

279
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
Amy who?

280
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
You know what?

281
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,020
I have...

282
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,020
What?

283
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Air.

284
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,020
A whole lot of it.

285
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,120
Especially dead air, like we're having on the show just to write about, you know, before

286
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
I set something in.

287
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,000
Actually, I actually did some purchasing today.

288
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,140
My X-Men fandom has resurged, like, massively, so I picked up one of the new X-Men graphic

289
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,320
novels except I need to go back and pick up the astonishing x-men one because

290
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,360
they're written by Joss Whedon who we all know is the god of sci-fi for giving

291
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,540
us Firefly Joss Whedon is my master now but I think it's funny because he writes

292
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,120
like shadow cat perfectly and he based Buffy off of her I think that's

293
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,280
fantastic yeah I'm a big big nerd so what I love

294
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:27,000
x-men wow there's actually a lot of businesses that support the Xbox Live

295
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,400
5 diamond card, and they have a whole list of them, um, including, what is it, Hollywood

296
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:40,200
Video Ace Hardware? Um, there's actually some local businesses for at least me, like the,

297
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:47,680
um, El Dorado Hills Auto Care, Mind, Body, and Harmony? What the fuck? That's weird.

298
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,600
Alright, I got all the votes tallied up whenever you guys are ready. That was hard. Dave and

299
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,480
busters you can get a $10 free gameplay with uh... ooh now that's kinda cool

300
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't like that idea

301
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,380
alright you guys are ready to hear tonight's cage match winner

302
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,360
just to give you an example an idea of how many votes we got tonight

303
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,740
look how far the stars go out there look at that

304
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,100
one song just took the other two out in the field and beat them senseless

305
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,340
I mean seriously I am

306
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,380
sorry to say

307
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,540
that i want to vote for tonight

308
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,060
and that way i'm a little

309
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,820
uh... we're now just uh... swept the vote tonight uh... there were no not to

310
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,980
say so i wanted to didn't weren't completely unloved cuz they did get

311
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
quite a few votes

312
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,280
in probably a normal week

313
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,780
so i wanted to might have won it but uh... you guys were nuts tonight we love

314
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,240
the participation and i would be xbox live diamond card

315
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,980
the pes museum

316
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,800
by one admission get the second free

317
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,120
Pez, you're a fan of Pez. I used to be. I used to collect Pez dispensers a long, long

318
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,340
time ago. I bought you some, I got you a Wonder Woman one. I know, and they're all sitting

319
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,760
in a drawer. Aww. But that way the sunlight doesn't damage them, they don't get dust,

320
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,360
so someday I'll take them out and display them. Excuses, excuses. I know. When I have

321
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,280
a house, that's my alphabets. When I have a house. You know, ironically enough, all

322
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,840
this stuff that these services are, they're all like local to us. Like Dublin, they have

323
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,360
have one in Dublin, California that walks up. You receive 20% off your entire bill.

324
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,880
Is it because you put in your zip code before you went into that site?

325
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,040
No. Well, maybe under my membership information or something like that, but I'm just surprised

326
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,720
that they have these small ass companies that are on here. I mean, I would think they'd

327
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:47,520
just be big name companies and stuff, but there's like Omaha Steaks, they have 1-800-PetMeds.com,

328
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,360
PaintShop Pro 4 for life.

329
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,960
Dude, no way. You know how I was all,

330
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Photoshop sucks! Photoshop sucks! Photoshop sucks! And then I used Photoshop CS.

331
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,520
And I was like, PaintShop Pro sucks!

332
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,540
Especially since PaintShop Pro doesn't recognize the angle sensitivity on my tablet.

333
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,120
Yeah, but for people who can't draw like me, PaintShop Pro 4 is awesome.

334
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,280
Stick figures, yo!

335
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,140
Alright.

336
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,080
I could make a dancing graphic like Jeremy Todd did.

337
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,800
Probably.

338
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,320
Actually, sadly my artistic talent won't even do that.

339
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,120
Loki, you want to get one more thought out there before I...

340
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,280
Oh, I was just going to say, games.com, if you use online site,

341
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,760
$75, if you purchase something over $75, you get $10 off with the card,

342
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,840
or pretty much if you just enter in promotional code, diamonds.

343
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,520
So, there you go, big secret right there.

344
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,840
Uno!

345
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,600
Yeah.

346
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,400
Nintendo Maniac 64 is the first in chat room to say MS Paint,

347
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,920
for the win.

348
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,720
I've done touch-ups and paint.

349
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,760
I use MS Paint at work all the time.

350
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,880
It's great for screenshots.

351
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,600
I have begged and begged and begged.

352
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,760
Look, if I'm doing all this crap for you,

353
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,180
just give me Photoshop so I don't

354
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,320
have to bring my laptop up here to do our flyers.

355
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,040
And so I actually use Microsoft Photo Editor and Paint.

356
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,920
I will website edit in Notepad for life.

357
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Notepad is awesome.

358
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,360
Chat room FUs, boys and girls.

359
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,320
And we're going to start it off with Mac Man.

360
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,860
My FU is to Apple, my favorite goddamn company. They better not buy Nintendo. They will kill them.

361
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,600
The Bandai Pinpin 2 is not a good idea.

362
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,220
Don't worry, MacMan, it's just dirty rumors from fanboys.

363
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,460
NintendoManiac64 says, FU to the chat room for not answering my question after asking twice,

364
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,100
so I'm asking you people at OLR.

365
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,300
What is the fastest Wipeout and Extreme G game?

366
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,220
I have F-Zero GX and beat AllCups on Master and completed Story Mode,

367
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,640
and several chapters on Very Hard 2. Thank you.

368
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,400
I defer to Loki, because I don't play Wipeout.

369
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,920
I don't know, I haven't really...

370
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,960
I like Wipeout 3, and Wipeout Pure is pretty good.

371
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,680
But those are the latest ones.

372
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,400
Well, that explains why no one answered your question. Nobody played the damn game.

373
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,760
Well, if you're really into...

374
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,960
Well, I'm not sure if this was a very fast game. I remember that Fatal Inertia was supposed to be pretty good on the PS3.

375
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,060
But I heard that that game seemed kind of slow.

376
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,420
I would just wait for Wipeout on the PS3 to come out because it's probably gonna be the

377
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
fastest one.

378
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
Hey!

379
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
No, I just found your photo.

380
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
You found my porn?

381
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Did you really?

382
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
No, I found your photo.

383
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
Oh.

384
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
God.

385
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Well, they're probably in there somewhere.

386
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
Stop looking for my porn!

387
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
Ooh!

388
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
Ooh!

389
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
Stop it!

390
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
What?

391
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,220
You can buy a dozen of Krispy Kreme donuts.

392
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,740
Okay, I swear to God, we're gonna be here till midnight if I don't get moving, people.

393
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
Alright.

394
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
DarklionXVI wants to...

395
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
Now I found it.

396
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
Sorry.

397
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:13,620

404
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:52,140
next week anyway so we might have to reschedule. I just kind of came to my mind. DJ Tyrant

405
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,220
says F you to work and feeling sick. F you to having to sleep and getting a new job that

406
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,540
requires me to actually get up early. Bandit says I want to send a big F you to the Dallas

407
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,220
mavericks for thinking that they can actually beat the miami heat

408
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,620
hitstun would like to say fuck you to nintendo's wifi connection for not letting the

409
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,000
four of us mario kart ds players in chat connect and play a game

410
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,060
dropping players and shit

411
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,760
dmn would like to say f you to any person under sixteen who plays gunbound

412
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,620
half of you son of bitches act like you just discovered the internet and the other half

413
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,480
think you are so fucking cool for taking a god damn computer game like it's

414
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,540
serious business

415
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,360
i hope you all die in a fire

416
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,600
heart dmn

417
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,400
The Fireboma says F you to Belmont Park for taking $34 of my money.

418
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,360
Go horsies go!

419
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,400
The Ichiban Crush says F you to the bad rental skates I were given that utterly destroyed

420
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,080
my feet when I went ice skating yesterday.

421
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I want to go ice skating.

422
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,660
Funnydale says F you to old people winning the lottery.

423
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,840
There should be an age limit to how old you can be to win the damn lottery.

424
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,740
Winning the lottery when you are 90 is like a blind person buying a car.

425
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,360
Maybe they're going to give the money to their kids.

426
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
DJ Pooh Eater says,

427
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,360
F you to the electric company for not supplying us with individual generators

428
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,360
because we had a blackout and I missed the entire Orange Lawn Radio show.

429
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Now I must listen to a podcast and explain it to all the bastards who ask,

430
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,360
what are you listening to?

431
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
And they look at me like I'm stupid.

432
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,360
I hate the world, but I less than three O-L-R.

433
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
I think he means, he hates the world, but not us.

434
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Ravenstaufen says, F you Nintendo for making Apple-inspired Nintendo DS Lite.

435
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
Dark Knight says,

436
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,360
my F you goes to me ending up being broke from the anime convention this weekend,

437
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,100
but it was well worth it.

438
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,300
Anoush says,

439
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,740
F U how in the I 405 when you're traveling

440
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,900
at 75 already you get past like you're standing still

441
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,340
and once you're in the carpool lane you are forced to go 120 miles an hour.

442
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,380
That's what I'm wondering, hello!

443
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,900
Ahrimasen says, F U to the hot weather and making me unable to fast combo on

444
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,020
popin' music.

445
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,260
My sticky hand sticking to the buttons. I have a question for Ahrimasen.

446
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,220
Why does your name does not have?

447
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,700
23rd Magus says,

448
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,800
F you to Hoardside Altric Valley groups on Malstorm. Organizing forty people is

449
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,620
like herding cats, three-legged dyslexic cats.

450
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,980
F you to my computer locking up randomly whenever I play games. F you to whatever

451
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,400
fucknugget thought the second half of Tales of Legendia didn't need voice

452
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,340
acting.

453
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,940
SSJ100Matt says F you to high schoolers and middle schoolers invading all the

454
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,100
malls, movie theaters, and arcade because they're off for the summer. Get jobs, dammit!

455
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:27,100
And SSG100Matt continues, F you to A-Rod Slump and F you to Kudaragi for not shutting the fuck up.

456
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Blaze says, my F you is to my new boss. She is a bitch. You better hope she doesn't listen to this show.

457
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Xander K says, F you to Microsoft for not putting Conker in the latest release of Backward Compatibility.

458
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Legend of Zaku says, F you to my college for being the dicks that they are, billing me and everyone in my apartment complex almost $1.50 each for community damages that I didn't do.

459
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Dark Tetsuya says, F you to Sky who forgot he'll be a cage match pick.

460
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:56,780
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to poor designs and anime next to con with an extremely small

461
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,020
game room where the same people sit there and won't leave the games, especially the

462
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,940
DDR machine and 2DX.

463
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,780
Also there was no room for the video room so I couldn't see the movies.

464
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:12,140
Bandit says F you to the furry convention that was held in Pittsburgh this past weekend.

465
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,540
Another F you to Raven's Dolphin for hating the Miami heat says Bandit.

466
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,260
Ooh snap, we got a...

467
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Okay, we are not having freakin' sports chat.

468
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:26,020
Last F.U. Jeremy Todd1 says F.U. Ravenstaufen for making that F.U. because the DS Lite is

469
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,760
sexy.

470
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
That's it, kids.

471
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
We gotta go.

472
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
I love my DS Lite.

473
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,260
We gotta wrap it up and get out of here because we have business to tend to.

474
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,480
No, I'm just hungry.

475
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,340
There's stuff to be done.

476
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,100
Macman sent me a private message saying you have PC porn, you know you love it.

477
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,380
I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean, but okay.

478
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,940
he's Mac man and you you have this reputation on Orange Laundry for not

479
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,500
liking Mac so I am completely annoyed of the stupid Apple commercials where they

480
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:02,780
have Apple guy and PC guy. Hi I'm a Mac I'm a PC. Yeah no oh yeah PC's are constantly

481
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:08,100
yeah my PC must be constantly rebooting during the show because yeah I'm

482
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,140
never I can't get anything that's just okay I'll tell you this much you know I

483
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,180
love Apple I really do but I kind of agree with that because I've been using

484
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,200
this computer for I don't know how many years I've never got a virus ever ever

485
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,440
I I took down my firewall and I don't have you know a virus scanner or

486
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:33,120
anything running no viruses ever so blow me Macintosh alright anyway we got it

487

488
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,000

489
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,220
future of orange lounge radio I mean it's big stuff guys the world hangs

490
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,940
Because Secretly Dark Soccer and I are going to murder Loki tonight and then that will

491
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
change the future of ours on video.

492
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
It's not so much a secret if you tell him!

493
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
Sorry.

494
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Sorry, we're not going to kill you.

495
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,060
We're going to, um, feed you pie.

496
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,180
Actually, I don't like pie.

497
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,580
Or donuts with white frosting on them.

498
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,940
Perhaps this song will fit Loki after tonight's staff meeting and it's our fortune cookie

499
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,380
message of the day.

500
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Enjoy.

501
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:20,380
Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave because I go berserk?

502
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind.

503
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:36,380
And they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha

504
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,380
To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time

505
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,380
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats

506
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,380
And they're coming to take me away, ha ha

507
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,380
You thought it was a joke and so you laughed, you laughed

508
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,380
When I had said that losing you would make me flip my lip

509
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:04,380
Right? You know you laughed, I heard you laugh, you laughed, you laughed and laughed, and then you left, but now you know I'm utterly mad.

510
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:11,380
And, they're coming to take me away, haha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, haha!

511
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:22,380
To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes and they're coming to take me away, haha!

512
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:31,380
I cooked your food, I cleaned your house, and this is how you pay me back for all my kind, unselfish, loving deeds.

513
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:40,380
Well, you just wait, they'll find you yet, and when they do, they'll put you in the ASPCA, you mangy mutt.

514
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:47,380
And, they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha,

515
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,440
To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time

516
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,760
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their green white coats

517
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,420
And they're coming to take me away to the happy home

518
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,540
With trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket-weavers

519
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,100
Who spit and smile and twiddle with bums and foes

520
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,820
And they're coming to take me away to the funny farm

521
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,040
Where life is beautiful all the time

522
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,000
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their green white coats

523
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:31,280
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.

524
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
You know we love you.

525
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,680
Stayin' up late, especially you crazy kids in the UK.

526
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,840
Actually, I think you finally went to bed.

527
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,280
But thank you guys still so much for listening.

528
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,160
We appreciate you and we'll see you next week, alright?

529
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,860
Our next live program is Tuesday night.

530
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,260
Dark Soccer's Pump Up The Volume. Wednesday night there will be no live program because

531
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:53,500
I will be in LA on a business trip. So you can try allgames.com instead because if I

532
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,900
can I'm going to make a cameo over there. Otherwise you'll just have to listen to Jamie's

533
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:04,140
show on Tuesday and our next live show on Sunday. Sound good? Alrighty. Have a great

534
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,540
