1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,063
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to start tonight's afterbirth.

2
00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:07,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Nellie, get back in here, Nellie, right now.

3
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:13,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Nellie walked in here because she heard the outro going, and she wanted to show Loki what she bought.

4
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:14,707
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you get here?

5
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:16,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the afterbirth, by the way, boys and girls.

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:17,848
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Stuff That's Too Hot to Podcast.

7
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:19,309
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you get here?

8
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:20,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a pink helmet.

9
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:21,490
[SPEAKER_00]: A pink?

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bike helmet.

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:22,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

13
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm retarded.

14
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I fall, I don't want to hurt myself.

15
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:31,774
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought a pink bike helmet for no reason?

16
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:32,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

17
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:35,417
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I bought it for a reason.

18
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:36,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

19
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:38,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I'll be right back.

20
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:40,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they can't see on the radio.

21
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:41,178
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they can't see on the radio.

22
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:41,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?

23
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:42,499
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the afterbirth.

24
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,279
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the real show.

25
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:45,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell Miklatov he needs to get in here too.

26
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Miklatov is going to make his way back in here too.

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,120
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought roller skates?

28
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I don't know how to... Hold on, we need to get her on mic.

29
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:56,021
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought roller skates?

30
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:59,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know how to do it, so Christopher was going to teach me.

31
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:01,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And he tried to teach me at Target, but I almost fell on him.

32
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:05,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought knee pads and elbow bobbers.

33
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:06,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Christopher made me, I didn't want to.

34
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:34,992
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole point.

35
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted pillows for my entire body.

36
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:38,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted pillows for my entire body.

37
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:41,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I feel that's the safest.

38
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody want to go rollerblading with me?

39
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:44,956
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do that.

40
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:45,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I have rollerblades in my car.

41
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:47,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's invited.

42
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:49,497
[SPEAKER_08]: The more people to hold me.

43
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:54,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I want to get regular street skates again because I used to have street skates.

44
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't use inlines because of my ankle.

45
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of an old injury I had to my ankle.

46
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they say I can have roller skating sex.

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,743
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, uh... That's not easy.

48
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:06,724
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.

49
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:07,725
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very nice.

50
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:08,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Mikotov?

51
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:09,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he here?

52
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the hell is he?

53
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he was in the living room.

54
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he playing Silent Hill with Annie?

55
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:15,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

56
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:16,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go get him.

57
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:17,235
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys fill time.

58
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:18,376
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a natural.

59
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:20,278
[SPEAKER_09]: All of these are so photoshopped.

60
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:23,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought them!

61
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I've read the first one.

62
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,244
[SPEAKER_09]: She wrote it under a pseudonym.

63
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:46,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not porno.

64
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:47,484
[SPEAKER_09]: It's art.

65
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:48,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Erotica.

66
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:49,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Miklatov was supposed to come on.

67
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It's erotica.

68
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:50,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

69
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:55,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Miklatov was supposed to come on and yell at people who didn't like Bomani in the U.S., but he pussied out.

70
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget what I said in chat.

71
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.

72
00:02:59,031 --> 00:02:59,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my fault, though.

73
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:03,154
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Miklatov, and I'm a big chicken.

74
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:04,514
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

75
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:06,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do Ask Nelly?

76
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:07,496
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, fine.

77
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:09,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And you field the questions while I set up Cage Match here.

78
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to ask questions.

79
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Go.

80
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:16,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.

81
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:17,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask questions.

82
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:19,184
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a new segment.

83
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask Nellie a question.

84
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:20,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's ask Nellie questions.

85
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,928
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys ask me questions.

86
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:25,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Nellie, do you like your books?

87
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:26,989
Yes.

88
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:27,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, here.

89
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,151
[SPEAKER_00]: You can borrow my mic while I set up the kitchen.

90
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I love books.

91
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:33,699
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

92
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:34,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than what?

93
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't, didn't, here, just take my mic.

94
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:37,542
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

95
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:39,703
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't play any other video games?

96
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:40,164
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

97
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:42,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't play video games.

98
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you played Tetris a little bit.

99
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I played Tetris a little bit.

100
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:47,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

101
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,050
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to level 16 on Bejeweled?

102
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, and 17 is the achievement, and I lost.

103
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, why didn't you earn me my damn achievement?

104
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:56,775
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I need the helmet.

105
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:57,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Work!

106
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,217
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I... Because he beats me.

107
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:02,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, if... Please help if he can't.

108
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:04,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:07,902
[SPEAKER_08]: There were no questions.

110
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,130
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you have for dinner, Nellie?

111
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:14,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I had one of those Frascata sandwiches from Wendy's.

112
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:23,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the turkey and Swiss, and I got it with no mayo, and I got a side salad with low-fat honey mustard dressing and a Diet Coke.

113
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:28,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Christopher just gave me an apple, because he's awesome.

114
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever asked the question, says Nat.

115
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,156
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question was, have you ever gone skydiving, which I know is no.

116
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask that question for me.

117
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,258
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't speak for me.

118
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,034
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have a brownie bite.

119
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the bad man touch you?

120
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:45,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Everywhere.

121
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:47,016
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about right.

122
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:50,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I eat whatever the crap I want diet now.

123
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Nellie, what is your opinion on boobs?

124
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:53,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I love boobs.

125
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You know whose boobs I really like?

126
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:56,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Jessica Alba's.

127
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:00,578
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a no nudity clause and that really sucks.

128
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:01,819
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because she's a biznatch.

129
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,540
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't like, what's her face?

130
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,300
[SPEAKER_08]: The redhead with the freckles.

131
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:13,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay Lohan, yes, because her nipple is on top, and that's just not right.

132
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,925
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like on the top of the boob.

133
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,806
[SPEAKER_00]: She was cuter when she, you know, more chubby and with the red hair.

134
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:22,647
[SPEAKER_08]: When she was a child, because you're a molester.

135
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a child molester.

136
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:25,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Lester the molester.

137
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:27,728
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now like anorexic.

138
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And Vilmar, you know, stupid.

139
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:31,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't joke.

140
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't joke about child molesting, not after the trial I went through this week.

141
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:43,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially about Wilmer Valderrama.

142
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:52,540
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a show on MTV called Yo Mama, to which I said, God damn it, you ripped that off of In Living Color.

143
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,262
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that he's producing this show, he's like, this is my greatest idea ever.

144
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:01,985
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dumb show to begin with, yet for some reason I watched the final today.

145
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:10,430
[SPEAKER_00]: The best trash talker in LA and some retarded white guy who thinks he's black or something.

146
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:19,056
[SPEAKER_08]: The funniest part of that show was that the white guy got $5,000 in cash and he was surrounded by a bunch of blacks and Mexicans.

147
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:20,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, he's not going to keep that.

148
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:21,298
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to get mugged.

149
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:24,263
[SPEAKER_08]: because they're all behind him looking at him hatefully.

150
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:28,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I smell hate crime.

151
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:33,965
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do the cage match.

152
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:35,265
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sit in on the cage match tonight?

153
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,266
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm going to go play with my new toys.

154
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:38,406
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, have fun with your new toys.

155
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show, Nellie.

156
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:39,967
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it.

157
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:40,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having me.

158
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:41,387
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

159
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, everybody.

160
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,208
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.

161
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:45,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange launch into the cage match.

162
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

163
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:08,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

164
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get into tonight's cage match.

165
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Song number one was last week's winner, and it comes to us from a little band.

166
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,680
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have heard of it before.

167
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Not because Jamie doesn't talk about it every week on the show or anything like that.

168
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:41,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I don't.

169
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:41,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's true.

170
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:42,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Every other show.

171
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:43,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other show.

172
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:44,122
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here it is.

173
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:45,202
[SPEAKER_00]: You voted it.

174
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:45,662
[SPEAKER_00]: It won.

175
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:47,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a clip of last week's winner.

176
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:50,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Song number one, The Gorillas, Happy Landfill.

177
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:39,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, so song number one, Gorillas with Happy Landfill.

178
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:44,800
[SPEAKER_00]: It must successfully beat two new songs to a bloody pulp, and that first song is going to come from Loki.

179
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,000
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your pick tonight?

180
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,842
[SPEAKER_00]: My song is from Junkie XL again, but this time it's a collaboration with somebody else.

181
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:56,224
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually pretty cool.

182
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,964
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Nightmare, or Nightmares, I believe.

183
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, yeah, it's short, so that's always good.

184
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:04,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Nightmares Featuring Infusion

185
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,454
Thank you for watching!

186
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:20,716
From the start it's easy to get lost in the darkness Darkness Darkness Darkness Darkness

187
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:55,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I kinda dig that one.

188
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:00,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a little repetitive, I think, to get a full ten from, but it gets loose to nine.

189
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:00,985
[SPEAKER_00]: It's short.

190
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,387
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like three minutes, which is awesome.

191
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,447
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very good for you, Loki.

192
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:38,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I tried, um, it's, I don't know, this was like one of the only songs I liked on this album, and this album actually, it was like, um, Junkie XL, or JXL Radio from, um, the Computer Hell Cabin or something like that, which is a weird name, but, uh, it was one of the tracks on there, and, I don't know, it was the only one I liked, so, I give it a 9.

193
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

194
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:41,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, time for my song.

195
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,772
[SPEAKER_00]: and what nerd doesn't love our next artist?

196
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:49,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been far too long since this person has released a song.

197
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:54,620
[SPEAKER_00]: But this guy put up this song on his website this last week saying, hey, I'm not dead.

198
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a brand new song.

199
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's great.

200
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it in the cage match.

201
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:04,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is, Weird Al Yankovic with You're Pitiful.

202
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:05,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:46,752
[SPEAKER_04]: My life is brilliant My life is brilliant Your life's a joke You're just pathetic You're always broke Your homemade Star Trek uniform Really ain't impressing me

204
00:15:48,140 --> 00:16:15,927
[SPEAKER_05]: You're suffering from delusions of adequacy You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true Never had a date that you couldn't inflate And you smell repulsive too

205
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:41,708
[SPEAKER_05]: What a bummer being you Well you just can't dance And forget romance Everybody you know still calls you

206
00:16:42,836 --> 00:17:05,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Farty Pants, but you'll always have a job Well, I mean, as long as you still can work that slurpy machine You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true

207
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:36,580
[SPEAKER_05]: You're half undressed Eating chips off your chest While you're playing Halo 2 No one's classier than you La la la la La la la la La la la la Loser

208
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:58,647
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pitiful, you're pitiful, you're pitiful, it's true Your dog would much rather play fetch by itself You still live with your mom when you're 42

209
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:29,182
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, song number three in tonight's cage match, Weird Al Yankovic with Your Pitiful.

210
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:31,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that song pitiful or magnificent, DarkSakura?

211
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:32,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Eleventy million.

212
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleventy million from DarkSakura.

213
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:36,853

217
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,759
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, place vote now.

218
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

219
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:38,989
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll tally them up, and we'll see who the wiener is.

220
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,037
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I just heard DarkSakura say, I hope I lose.

221
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:45,119
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.

222
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,138
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

223
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:16,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I've basically just, since you just put that up there, I've basically linked it to like seven people just now.

224
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,853
[SPEAKER_00]: A new song, really?

225
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:18,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Download this!

226
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:19,854
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great!

227
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:21,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll see.

228
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:22,024
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

229
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:25,526
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be some anti-Weird Al people in our chat room, so I don't know.

230
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:29,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention, and I just saw this thing on IGN.

231
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about it.

232
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,749
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, because I can tally votes when I do that.

233
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:35,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurry up and get your votes in now, because we don't have time.

234
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:44,693
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have in my possession, and this is such a nerd of me, and we talked about this a while ago, that they were getting sent out.

235
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my Xbox Live Diamond card.

236
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't you special?

237
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, now what the fuck can you do with it?

238
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:54,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

239
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:56,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Impale people in the head!

240
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show people that I'm a member of Xbox Live!

241
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:00,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Mwah!

242
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Expires May 2007.

243
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:03,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

244
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:06,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

245
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I'd show that.

246
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:10,782
[SPEAKER_09]: You can stab people in the head with it.

247
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Or give them evil paper cuts with your plastic card.

248
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't really give paper cuts with this, it's not sharp.

249
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, you catch them just the right way on the edge, then you know, hey.

250
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,340
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is my nerd certification card.

251
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:25,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

252
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:30,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like to point out, there are more votes in cage match tonight than I have ever seen in the four year history of this show.

253
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,205
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.

254
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:33,846
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a hard time tallying this up.

255
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:34,987
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need to fill more time.

256
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:38,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywho.

257
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,810
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I have?

258
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:42,471
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

259
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:48,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Air, a whole lot of it, especially dead air like we're having on the show just to write about, you know, before I said something.

260
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I actually did some purchasing today.

261
00:21:52,990 --> 00:22:03,339
[SPEAKER_09]: My X-Men fandom has resurged like massively, so I picked up one of the new X-Men graphic novels, except I need to go back and pick up the Astonishing X-Men one because they're written by Joss Whedon.

262
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:08,161
[SPEAKER_09]: who we all know is the god of sci-fi for giving us Firefly.

263
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Joss Whedon is my master now.

264
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:15,785
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's funny because he writes like Shadowcat perfectly and he based Buffy off of her.

265
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:16,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's fantastic.

266
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:18,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm a big, big nerd.

267
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:19,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So what?

268
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:20,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I love X-Men.

269
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:23,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

270
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:30,852
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a lot of businesses that support the Xbox Live Diamond Card and they have a whole list of them including...

271
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,968
[SPEAKER_00]: was a Hollywood Video Ace Hardware.

272
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:41,974
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some local businesses for at least me, like the El Dorado Hills Auto Care.

273
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:44,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind, Body, and Harmony.

274
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:45,957
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?

275
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,679
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.

276
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:51,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I got all the votes tallied up whenever you guys are ready.

277
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:53,223
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard.

278
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:58,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave and Busters, you can get $10 free gameplay with live.

279
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, now that's kind of cool.

280
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:01,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that idea.

281
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:02,618
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

282
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,261
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys ready to hear tonight's cage match winner?

283
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:05,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo.

284
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:09,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of how many votes we got tonight.

285
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:10,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet crap.

286
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how far the stars go out there.

287
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:13,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.

288
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:18,111
[SPEAKER_00]: One song just took the other two out in the field and beat them senseless.

289
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:19,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seriously.

290
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sorry to say.

291
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,775
[SPEAKER_00]: that I whooped you both tonight.

292
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:26,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care, I wanted you to.

293
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:28,477
[SPEAKER_09]: In that way, I'm a winner too.

294
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:31,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird Al just swept the vote tonight.

295
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:36,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not to say song one and two weren't completely unloved, because they did get quite a few votes.

296
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:42,481
[SPEAKER_00]: In probably a normal week, song one or two might have won it, but you guys were nuts tonight.

297
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,721
[SPEAKER_00]: We loved the participation tonight.

298
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:47,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, Xbox Live Diamond Card, the Pez Museum.

299
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:50,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy one in Mission, get the second free.

300
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:51,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Eh?

301
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:52,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Pez?

302
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,090
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fan of Pez.

303
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be.

304
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:56,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to collect Pez dispensers a long, long time ago.

305
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:56,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought you some.

306
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:57,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you a Wonder Woman one.

307
00:23:58,053 --> 00:23:58,693
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

308
00:23:58,733 --> 00:23:59,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all sitting in a drawer.

309
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:01,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw.

310
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,120
[SPEAKER_00]: But, hey, that way the sunlight doesn't damage them and they don't get dust.

311
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,381
[SPEAKER_00]: So someday I'll take them out and display them.

312
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:06,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

313
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,782
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have a house, that's my, that's my old fallback.

314
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:10,543
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have a house.

315
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:17,525
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ironically enough, all this stuff that's, you know, that these services are, they're all, like, local to us.

316
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:21,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Dublin, they have one in Dublin, California that's, uh, walks up.

317
00:24:22,347 --> 00:24:24,268
[SPEAKER_00]: You receive 20% off your entire bill.

318
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:26,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because you put in your zip code before you went into that site?

319
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:36,474
[SPEAKER_00]: No, well maybe under my membership information or something like that, but I'm just surprised that they have these small ass companies that are on here.

320
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:51,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would think they'd just be big name companies and stuff, but there's like Omaha Steaks, they have 1-800-PetMeds.com, Doggy Daycare, there's some weird stuff on here, but I don't know, it's kind of neat.

321
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:59,347
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta get to chatroom FUs tonight, kids, because I know a lot of you guys have chatroom FUs.

322
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get to those.

323
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:03,248
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

324
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:04,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I share what?

325
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going through the shared folders.

326
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:09,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you... She's looking for the porn is what she's doing.

327
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, why did you share PaintShop Pro?

328
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:16,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably so I could do it on... Probably if I shared something really random, it was probably so I could get it up on Christopher's computer.

329
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:19,754
[SPEAKER_00]: GameStop.com PaintShop Pro 4 for life.

330
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:21,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, no way.

331
00:25:21,617 --> 00:25:25,359
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how I was all, Photoshop sucks, Photoshop sucks, Photoshop sucks.

332
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,780
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I used Photoshop CS.

333
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:28,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, PaintShop Pro sucks.

334
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:34,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially since PaintShop Pro doesn't recognize the angle sensitivity on my tablet.

335
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:37,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but for people who can't draw like me, PaintShop Pro 4 is awesome.

336
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:38,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Stick figures, yo.

337
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:44,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I could make a dancing graphic like Jeremy Todd did, probably.

338
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:47,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, sadly, my artistic talent won't even do that.

339
00:25:47,355 --> 00:26:01,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, you want to get one more thought out there before I... Oh, I was just going to say, GameStop.com, if you use online site, if you purchase something over $75, you get $10 off with the card, or pretty much if you just enter in promotional code DIAMONDS.

340
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,528
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there you go, big secret right there.

341
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:06,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, whoo!

342
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:12,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo Maniac 64 is the first in chatroom to say MS Paint for the win.

343
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done touch-ups in Paint.

344
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:16,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I use MS Paint at work all the time.

345
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:17,855
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for screenshots.

346
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:19,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I have begged and begged and begged.

347
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:23,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, if I'm doing all this crap for you, just give me Photoshop so I don't have to bring my laptop up here to do our flyers.

348
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:29,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I actually use Microsoft Photo Editor and Paint.

349
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I will website edit in Notepad for life.

350
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:34,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Notepad is awesome.

351
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:36,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Chatroom FUs, boys and girls.

352
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:41,701
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna start it off with MacMan!

353
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:45,026
[SPEAKER_00]: My FU is to Apple, my favorite goddamn company.

354
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,548
[SPEAKER_00]: They better not buy Nintendo.

355
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:47,470
[SPEAKER_00]: They will kill them.

356
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,334
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bandai Pin Pin 2 is not a good idea.

357
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:52,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, Macman.

358
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,700
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just dirty rumors from fanboys.

359
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:58,526
[SPEAKER_00]: NintendoManiac64 says, F you to the chatroom for not answering my question after asking twice.

360
00:26:58,586 --> 00:27:00,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm asking you people at OLR.

361
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:04,032
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the fastest Wipeout and Extreme G game?

362
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:09,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I have F-Zero GX and beat all cups on Master and completed Story Mode and several chapters on Very Hard 2.

363
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

364
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I defer to Loki because I don't play Wipeout.

365
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:20,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Wipeout 3 and Wipeout Pure is pretty good, but those are the latest ones.

366
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that explains why no one answered your question.

367
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:26,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody played the damn game.

368
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:29,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not sure if this was a very fast game.

369
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:34,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that Fatal Inertia was supposed to be pretty good on the PS3, but I heard that that game seemed kind of slow.

370
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:40,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just wait for Wipeout on the PS3 to come out, because that's probably going to be the fastest one.

371
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:42,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey!

372
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:45,039
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just found your photo.

373
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,660
[SPEAKER_00]: You found my porn?

374
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you really?

375
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,901
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I found your photo.

376
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:48,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

377
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:49,542
[SPEAKER_00]: God.

378
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:51,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're probably in there somewhere.

379
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:52,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop looking for my porn!

380
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:53,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it!

381
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:57,167
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy a dozen of Krispy Kreme donuts.

382
00:27:57,247 --> 00:28:00,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I swear to God we're going to be here until midnight if I don't get moving, people.

383
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:00,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

384
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,331
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkLionXVI wants to... Now I found it.

385
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:03,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

386
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:08,135
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkLion wants to say, hey, I play Wipeout, so enjoy.

387
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:08,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

388
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:11,657
[SPEAKER_00]: You found Loki's porn or my porn?

389
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have porn.

390
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:14,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not shared.

391
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,379
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know who that is?

392
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:15,879
[SPEAKER_00]: X-Verse.

393
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:22,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I found X-Verse porn.

394
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:23,344
[SPEAKER_00]: He shares it?

395
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:24,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess so.

396
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, come on, I gotta get through this.

397
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:30,924
[SPEAKER_00]: BlackWolf says F you to Jesper.

398
00:28:31,524 --> 00:28:31,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.

399
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:34,847
[SPEAKER_00]: JeremyTodd1 says F you to Loki for no apparent reason.

400
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,829
[SPEAKER_00]: F you my car for having shitty brakes right now so I have to go get them fixed.

401
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,631
[SPEAKER_00]: F you to myself for not having a podcast again this week.

402
00:28:41,711 --> 00:28:43,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn work is making me too busy.

403
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:45,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to be on his podcast, but...

404
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:48,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm traveling next week anyway, so we might have to reschedule.

405
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,260
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of came to my mind.

406
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,902
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Tyrant says, F you to work and feeling sick.

407
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:58,245
[SPEAKER_00]: F you to having to sleep and getting a new job that requires me to actually get up early.

408
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:05,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Bandit says, I want to send a big F you to the Dallas Mavericks for thinking that they can actually beat the Miami Heat.

409
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:12,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitstun would like to say, fuck you to Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection for not letting the four of us Mario Kart DS players in chat connect and play a game.

410
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Dropping players and shit.

411
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:18,428
[SPEAKER_00]: DMN would like to say F you to any person under 16 who plays Gunbound.

412
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:25,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of you son of bitches act like you just discovered the internet and the other half think you are so fucking cool for taking a goddamn computer game like it's serious business.

413
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you all die in a fire.

414
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:28,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart, DMN.

415
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:34,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Fireboma says, F you to Belmont Park for taking $34 of my money.

416
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:35,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Go, horsies, go.

417
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:43,230
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ichiban Crush says, F you to the bad rental skates I were given that utterly destroyed my feet when I went ice skating yesterday.

418
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go ice skating.

419
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:47,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Funnydale says, F you to old people winning the lottery.

420
00:29:47,592 --> 00:29:50,354
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be an age limit to how old you can be to win the damn lottery.

421
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:53,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Winning the lottery when you are 90 is like a blind person buying a car.

422
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:57,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're going to give the money to their kids.

423
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:04,079
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ PooEater says, F you to the electric company for not supplying us with individual generators because we had a blackout and I missed the entire Orange Launch Radio show.

424
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:08,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I must listen to podcasts and explain it to all the bastards who ask, what are you listening to?

425
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look at me like I'm stupid.

426
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate the world, but I less than three OLR.

427
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:16,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he means he hates the world, but not us.

428
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:21,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Raven Stolpen says, F you Nintendo for making Apple-inspired Nintendo DS Lite.

429
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:27,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Knight says, my FU goes to me ending up being broke from the anime convention this weekend, but it was well worth it.

430
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:39,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Anush says, FU, how in the I-405 when you're traveling at 75 already, you get past like you're standing still, and once you're in the carpool lane, you're forced to go 120 miles an hour.

431
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:41,032
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm wondering, hello.

432
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:49,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Arimasen says, FU to the hot weather and making me unable to fast combo on poppin' music, my sticky hands sticking to the buttons.

433
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:51,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question for RMSN.

434
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:51,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

435
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does your name does not have?

436
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:56,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

437
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:01,231
[SPEAKER_00]: 23rdMagazine says, F you to Hordeside Altric Valley groups on Malstorm.

438
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Organizing 40 people is like herding cats.

439
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:05,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Three-legged dyslexic cats.

440
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:08,334
[SPEAKER_00]: F you to my computer locking up randomly whenever I play games.

441
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:12,817
[SPEAKER_00]: F you to whatever fucknugget thought the second half of Tales of Legendia didn't need voice acting.

442
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:20,369
[SPEAKER_00]: SSJ100 Matt says F you to high schoolers and middle schoolers invading all the malls, movie theaters, and arcade because they're off for the summer.

443
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:21,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Get jobs, dammit!

444
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,013
[SPEAKER_00]: And SSJ100 Matt continues F you to A-Rod Slump and F you to Kutaragi for not shutting the fuck up.

445
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:29,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Blaze says my F you is to my new boss.

446
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:30,595
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a bitch.

447
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:31,876
[SPEAKER_00]: You better hope she doesn't listen to this show.

448
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:50,761

449
00:31:51,121 --> 00:32:01,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Sephiroth 1215 says, F you to Poor Designs and Anime Next, a con, with an extremely small game room where the same people sit there and won't leave the games, especially the DDR machine and 2DX.

450
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was no room for the video room, so I couldn't see the movies.

451
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:11,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Bandit says, F you to the furry convention that was held in Pittsburgh this past weekend.

452

[SPEAKER_00]: Another F you to Raven's Dolphin for hating the Miami Heat, says Bandit.

453
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:16,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, snap, we got a...

454
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:20,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we are not having freaking sports chat.

455
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:21,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Last FU.

456
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:26,634
[SPEAKER_00]: JeremyTodd1 says FU Raven's Dolphin for making that FU because the DS Lite is sexy.

457
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:30,206
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, kids.

458
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:30,846
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta go.

459
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:31,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my DSR.

460
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:34,609
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta wrap it up and get out of here because... We're hungry.

461
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:35,930
[SPEAKER_00]: We have business to tend to.

462
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:37,191
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not hungry.

463
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:38,632
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff to be done.

464
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:42,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Macman sent me a private message saying, you have PC porn, you know you love it.

465
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean, but okay.

466
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:54,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's Macman, and you have this reputation on Orange Launch Radio for not liking Mac, so... Okay, I am completely annoyed of those stupid Apple commercials where they have...

467
00:32:55,146 --> 00:32:57,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple Guy and PC Guy.

468
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:58,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm a Mac, I'm a PC.

469
00:32:58,849 --> 00:32:59,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.

470
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:09,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, PCs are constantly... Yeah, my PC must be constantly rebooting during this show because, yeah, I'm never... I can't get anything done.

471
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:11,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll tell you this much.

472
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,780
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I love Apple.

473
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

474
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:17,684
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of agree with that because I've been using this computer for I don't know how many years.

475
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:18,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never gotten a virus, ever.

476
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:19,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever.

477
00:33:20,286 --> 00:33:20,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I...

478
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:22,500
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

479
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,716
[SPEAKER_00]: The world hangs on the bones.

480
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:48,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Because secretly DarkSakura and I are going to murder Loki tonight.

481
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:49,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that will change the future of our video.

482
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:52,040
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not so much of a secret if you tell him.

483
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

484
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, we're not going to kill you.

485
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,143
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to feed you pie.

486
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:57,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like pie.

487
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Or donuts with white frosting on them.

488
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:04,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps this song will fit Loki after tonight's staff meeting.

489
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:06,789
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's our fortune cookie message of the day.

490
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.

491
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:20,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave because I go berserk?

492
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind.

493
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:45,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And, they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha, to the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time, and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha ha!

494
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:57,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was a joke and so you laughed, you laughed when I had said that losing you would make me flip my lid, right?

495
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:11,865
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you laughed, I heard you laugh, you laughed, you laughed and laughed and then you left, but now you know I'm utterly mad And they're coming to take me away, ha ha, they're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha

496
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:31,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I cooked your food, I cleaned your house, and this is how you pay me back for all my kind, unselfish, loving deeds.

497
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:32,719
Huh?

498
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:34,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you just wait.

499
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,685
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll find you yet, and when they do, they'll put you in the ASPCA, you mangy mutt.

500
00:35:42,526 --> 00:36:06,865
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming to take me away, ha-ha They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats And they're coming to take me away, ha-ha To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds And basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes And they're coming to take me away

501
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:11,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

502
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:21,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi!

503
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:22,779
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not dead.

504
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:25,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was just having printer drama.

505
00:36:26,661 --> 00:36:27,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Printer drama!

506
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:28,782
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, guys.

507
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:31,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting Independent Radio.

508
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:34,786
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we love you, staying up late, especially you crazy kids in the UK.

509
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:35,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think he finally went to bed.

510
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:38,468
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys still so much for listening.

511
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:42,110
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you, and we'll see you next week, alright?

512
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next live program is Tuesday night.

513
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:45,412
[SPEAKER_00]: It's DarkSakura's Pump Up the Volume.

514
00:36:46,192 --> 00:36:50,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday night, there will be no live program because I will be in LA on a business trip.

515
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:55,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can try allgames.com instead because if I can, I'm going to make a cameo over there.

516
00:36:56,237 --> 00:37:01,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you'll just have to listen to Jamie's show on Tuesday and our next live show on Sunday.

517
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound good?

518
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.

519
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great week.

520
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:08,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, reconnect to the station in 15 seconds for more video game music.
