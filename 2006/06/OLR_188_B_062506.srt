[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 188 for this June the 25th of 2006.

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:28,514
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here.

4
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,476
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get back into the news very shortly here.

5
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:38,060
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I wanted to grill our special guest in studio, 23rd Magus, here for just a minute here about something he had told me about on break.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,482
[SPEAKER_11]: You were talking about World of Warcraft, right?

7
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:41,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

8
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:44,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And you were talking about the add-ons for World of Warcraft.

9
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:44,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

10
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:50,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, there was one that I thought was very interesting that you said you had installed that messes with the chat somehow.

11
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:51,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard of this.

12
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:52,268
[SPEAKER_08]: This sounds great.

13
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:54,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's an add-on called Eloquence.

14
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:55,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a chat filter.

15
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:06,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I refer to it as a sanity filter for the grammar freaks out there who are tired of the noob speak, the dude speak, the lead speak, or just plain dumb speak.

16
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:12,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it filters through whatever comes through your chat and

17
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:13,364
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

18
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:54,324
[SPEAKER_08]: and most of the add-ons for the WoW players you can go to ui.worldofwar.net or curse-gaming.com and pick up some add-ons to kind of enhance your play experience.

19
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So this filter basically...

20
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,307
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

21
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:22,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the times where you do it as a joke when it's funny.

22
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:30,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, I love good grammar, and I like to see good grammar when I'm about in my MMOs.

23
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you send me that for Ragnarok.

24
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful thought.

25
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:43,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted you to be able to share that with our listeners, because I didn't know about that, but I'm only a casual World of Warcraft player.

26
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:44,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not hardcore.

27
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:46,689
[SPEAKER_08]: You are a casual's casual, Robyn.

28
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:49,263
[SPEAKER_11]: A casual casual who has never even hit 60.

29
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,424
[SPEAKER_11]: But you'll have more fun when you hit 60.

30
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:50,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

31
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:51,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

32
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:51,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

33
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Some news out of Nintendo this week.

34
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:20,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Some power players over at Nintendo, namely Iwata and Miyamoto, have been discussing the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and more.

35
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:23,768
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a full in-depth article over on Gamasutra.com.

36
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:26,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought maybe I'd pull some choice quotes out of here.

37
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Iwata talked about the GameCube launch.

38
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:35,291
[SPEAKER_11]: When we launched GameCube, the initial sales were good, and all the hardware was manufactured at the time we were sold through.

39
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:46,739
[SPEAKER_11]: However, at this period, we could not provide the market with strong software titles in a timely fashion.

40
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:52,563
[SPEAKER_11]: As a result, we could not leverage the initial launch time momentum, and sales of GameCube slowed down.

41
00:03:52,963 --> 00:04:04,731
[SPEAKER_11]: To avoid repeating this with Wii, we have been intensifying the software development, both internally at Nintendo and at developers outside the company, in order to prepare an aggressive software lineup for Wii and after the launch.

42
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:12,754
[SPEAKER_11]: So it kind of sounds like they're learning from some of the mistakes they made with GameCube, which was namely, you know, kind of a dead period, which kind of happened with the DS, too, didn't it?

43
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:24,660
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I remember for a couple months after the DS came out, even on this show, because we were up and running by the time the DS was out, and I remember earlier episodes of this program, during that lull, we were kind of like, come on, Nintendo, where's our games?

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Ping Pals ain't gonna cut it!

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on!

46
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And suddenly, boom!

47
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:29,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Hit games.

48
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then, like, just one hit game after another.

49
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Miyamoto, I'm sure you guys want to know what he said.

50
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:34,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a quote from Miyamoto.

51
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:41,736
[SPEAKER_11]: While I feel that we need more internal software development resources at Nintendo, we have not increased the number greatly.

52
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:51,703
[SPEAKER_11]: When we combine the total number of people working for Nintendo's first party and second party titles, however, there are far more than 1,500 people working on the titles today.

53
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:53,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

54
00:04:53,965 --> 00:05:01,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Some quotes there from the main men themselves that they're trying to learn from their mistakes with the GameCube and go forth with that.

55
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,551
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I applaud Nintendo.

56
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's good business sense.

57
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:11,265
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what any business needs to progress is learn from their mistakes.

58
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:16,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and you can't just assume that the business is going to be there no matter what, and I will not...

59
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Name any companies here who seem to be guilty of making that mistake recently, but it's four letters, starts with an S, ends with Oni.

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:48,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of progressive thinking, the brand new MacBook, basically running off of some really crappy integrated graphics chip that

61
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,456
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unable to run most games.

62
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:52,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, fear not.

63
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:56,741
[SPEAKER_09]: At least you can use it sort of like the Wii.

64
00:05:56,841 --> 00:06:02,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Using the accelerometer that's built into it, it's basically designed to detect if the computer is falling.

65
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:30,254
[SPEAKER_09]: you know stop the hard drive so that doesn't you know ruin any of your data well a clever gamer has actually used this program called the AMS 2 HID which is used with this program Neverball to basically make the modern-day equivalent of a wooden labyrinth so by tilting your computer you can use it to control games

66
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Crappy games, yes, but you can control games.

67
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew you would not be able to get through that story without taking a swing.

68
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, it can't run anything.

69
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,273
[SPEAKER_09]: It says right in the article here.

70
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:53,578
[SPEAKER_09]: It's using basically this integrated graphics chip that's designed by Apple, and it doesn't run anything because it's not ATI or NVIDIA compliant.

71
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:55,779
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm sorry, StarCraft.

72
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,119
[SPEAKER_09]: A.T.I.

73
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Chip in this one.

74
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:29,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think it's a silly idea, but, you know, whatever, some guy's bored and wants to do, you know, Labyrinth, whatever, but I don't really see it being the next trend in gaming.

75
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:35,666
[SPEAKER_11]: This is more one of those, you know, isn't that funny stories to me.

76
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:44,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I mean, if you, it's just like, was it, like that stupid game that they had with, um,

77
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:52,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Windows 98, that bumper car game thing that came with.

78
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that sucked too.

79
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:59,989
[SPEAKER_09]: None of the games made by Microsoft or Apple that come with their systems.

80
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:02,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, they're not supposed to be that great.

81
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, they all suck.

82
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:07,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can't really innovate on Solitaire.

83
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:08,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

84
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:11,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Kiss my ass.

85
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:12,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Chip's challenged with the shit.

86
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:15,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't come with it.

87
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:16,975
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to buy it separately.

88
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:18,376
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

89
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we were talking about Wii-type technology there a little bit.

90
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,901
[SPEAKER_11]: But what is really coming to the Wii?

91
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:28,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps some new trademarks registered by Nintendo of Japan give some hints.

92
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:32,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Wii Culture was something that was recently trademarked by them.

93
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:38,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Wii Pointer, which kind of sounds like it might be the name of what we've been calling the Wii Mode or the Rev Mode.

94
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,034
[SPEAKER_11]: What were you calling it, DarkSakura?

95
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always been calling it the Wii Mode.

96
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:43,216
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii Con.

97
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:43,656
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii Con.

98
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:44,437
[SPEAKER_11]: You were calling it the Wii Con.

99
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:49,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it sounds like the official name is probably going to be the Wii Pointer because I don't know what else that could be.

100
00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:02,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, they've registered Exclamation Point, Exclamation Point M. And you can actually look that up online if you want to see that trademark for yourself.

101
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:03,600
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like...

102
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:12,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Exclamation, exclamation, M could be some type of instant messaging because that kind of looks like I am when you look at it.

103
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:17,091
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we don't know anything 100% for sure until the system actually comes out.

104
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,413
[SPEAKER_11]: So we shall see.

105
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,456
[SPEAKER_11]: But we like to speculate based on what's going on behind the scenes.

106
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:23,657
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the instant messenger.

107
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that announced for sure?

108
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,380
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm making that up.

109
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:33,213
[SPEAKER_01]: and Nintendo Maniac 64 is pointing out that it's way upside down.

110
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:34,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.

111
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we figured that one out.

112
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:42,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and that's a cutesy thing to do, which would make sense for Nintendo, but we'll find out.

113
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:43,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

115
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:50,483
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be, I guess, instant messaging, but who knows.

116
00:09:51,351 --> 00:10:00,756
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing, though, that Nintendo does have in store, at least, is the fact that their controller actually vibrates, and it is wireless, so that's one step ahead of Sony.

117
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:11,963
[SPEAKER_09]: But, of course, Immersion says that they're wondering now if Nintendo copied them, and that there could possibly be a lawsuit against Nintendo.

118
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:19,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We know for a fact, of course, Microsoft actually licenses the Immersion technology or whatever.

119
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

120
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:25,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe that they're the first company to think of rumbling controllers.

121
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:28,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I don't know.

122
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:35,384
[SPEAKER_09]: They're basically going to keep a close eye on the Wii to see if the technology is the same and if they can make some money off of it.

123
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:36,284
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is it?

124
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:38,045
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got our eye on you.

125
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,007
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got our eye on you.

126
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:44,730
[SPEAKER_09]: We're the only one who can get to work, so obviously you copied us.

127
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's basically what it's, you know, backwards thinking.

128
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:50,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm starting to wonder about these guys.

129
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:51,245
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of interesting.

130
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like them.

131
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:53,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

132
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:54,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because of this?

133
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:56,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't like immersion.

134
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

135
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,071
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to tell me why.

136
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:00,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't I like them?

137
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:03,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're basically trying to profit off of all this stuff.

138
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:10,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, they're trying to sue for... Why didn't they sue them back in the day when they had the Rumble Pack or something like that?

139
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't they sue back when the original PlayStation came out?

140
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:17,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

141
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullymania has an interesting perspective on this in our chatroom.

142
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,471
[SPEAKER_09]: When capitalism no longer works, you sue.

143
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:52,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting perspective.

144
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:17,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

145
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:27,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I had a, uh, something caught in my throat.

146
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:27,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Hairball?

147
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hairball.

148
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,683
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with as much hair as I managed to brush off the cat last night, I wouldn't be surprised.

149
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:43,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, um, well, you know how Sony was saying, you know, the, uh,

150
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,393
[SPEAKER_01]: PS3 as a computer, the PS3 as a computer, blah blah blah.

151
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:48,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a story about this.

152
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you brought this up a couple weeks ago, yeah, about the computer thing with the PS3.

153
00:12:52,417 --> 00:13:02,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, basically there was a, the UK Court of Appeals has said that the PlayStation 2 is not a computer.

154
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,324
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically pretty much laughed at Sony.

155
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:18,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord Justice C. Chadwick said that Sony's skeleton argument was, to quote, beyond what can be regarded as acceptable written advocacy.

156
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:23,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Sony got pwned.

157
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,479
[SPEAKER_11]: They got served.

158
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

159
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,881
[SPEAKER_11]: So what does this mean?

160
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Those tax breaks they were looking forward to may not happen.

161
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:31,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

162
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:37,034
[SPEAKER_01]: The UK Court of Appeals also denied Sony any right to bring the case to the European Court of Justice.

163
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:49,120
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing they should note is it doesn't matter anyways if the PS3 is considered a computer or not because those taxes on electronics are gone now.

164
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:53,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So it wouldn't matter if it's categorized as a

165
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:59,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Game console, has a PC, has a vibrator, it doesn't matter.

166
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:02,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still going to be taxed for it.

167
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:04,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

168
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:10,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I think any way to make more money, it seems like nowadays, it's just... I don't know.

169
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:12,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Very desperate.

170
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:14,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Very crazy.

171
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:19,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Crazy like Kojima and his comparisons to steak.

172
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:22,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, what may I be talking about?

173
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:24,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually...

174
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:26,045
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3, PS4, PS5

175
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:58,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, for the 360, if they want a great steak dinner, a great steak with their family, a little bit more casual during the weekends, they might select the 360.

176
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:03,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand how these comparisons of steak work, but whatever.

177
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:09,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, then to the Wii, why not have a great steak at your house every day, and then you might choose the Wii.

178
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:13,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make any sense to you?

179
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it doesn't make any sense to me.

180
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:25,062
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, usually it's the eccentric people that are making these comparisons to food and other things that, I don't know, it's a very strange comparison to be making.

181
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:26,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Then he was talking about movies.

182
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:36,748
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 3 is like a movie theater for people who want to see this movie on a big screen with THX and 5.1 audio, even if they have to pay a high price.

183
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:37,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the 360...

184
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,272
[SPEAKER_09]: The 360 is like a DVD.

185
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:46,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you don't know what movie you want to see, so you go to the store and see if you can pick up a good one.

186
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I don't understand.

187
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:53,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the Wii is like a TV for when you're at home.

188
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,421
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know what you want to watch, but you want to have that variety.

189
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:07,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the best people I got to meet at E3, Igarashi Koji, is actually...

190
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:21,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some comments about the Playstation 3 at E3 and he's quoted as saying maybe it's too expensive but he did actually have an interview with Game Informer

191
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:31,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about Microsoft, he said he wasn't really negative about Microsoft, but to quote, for some reason they tend to back off a little when it comes to something really foreign.

192
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:40,549
[SPEAKER_01]: But if Japanese developers would say they're working on Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest or Metal Gear maybe, then I guess Japanese consumers would take it seriously and consider purchasing it.

193
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:59,322
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also stated that as far as the New Castlevania game is going for Portrait of Ruin, the next installment after Dawn of Sorrow, it might feature unlockable co-op missions to be played over Wi-Fi, but that's not confirmed.

194
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:02,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, he's quoted as saying it's not confirmed because he hasn't started working on it.

195
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:06,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's thinking that it would be something unlockable.

196
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:30,342
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also mentioned that basically there's going to be the two-screen display for Portrait of Ruin, again for the DS, different collectible items in there, but it's not stated whether or not it's going to be skills and items rather than souls.

197
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:36,726
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I had to say, but there was the potential about...

198
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,814
[SPEAKER_01]: and possibly working on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

199
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:41,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll still come up in that interview.

200
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:46,159
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure many folks would be very much looking forward to a Castlevania on the PlayStation 3.

201
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I just loved his reaction.

202
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:48,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

203
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:51,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps it's a bit too expensive.

204
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:56,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, another game that people are really looking forward to is Super Smash Bros.

205
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:57,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl.

206
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:59,109
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a new rumor floating around.

207
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:00,851
[SPEAKER_11]: It started at GoNintendo.com.

208
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:06,104
[SPEAKER_11]: The Ubisoft is going to be getting into the game there with some of their characters.

209
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:23,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you think about what that would bring to the table, that could be Jade from Beyond Good and Evil, Rayman, Sam Fisher, which would be an interesting counterpart to Solid Snake if you think about it, and the Prince from Prince of Persia, which I think probably from that list, Rayman and the Prince would seem most likely, especially Rayman.

210
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:24,759
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be an interesting addition.

211
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:25,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I could see that.

212
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

213
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:34,873
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was developer Mashihiro Sakurai saying that other third-party characters would be a definite possibility.

214
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:40,634
[SPEAKER_11]: And GoNintendo.com, I suppose, is speculating that Ubisoft is possibly the other third party being involved there.

215
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,815
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what would be cool, though, if they did it?

216
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:47,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Since they're releasing Rayman's Raving Rabbits, have the rabbits as one of the characters.

217
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:48,696
[SPEAKER_09]: You just want to kill bunnies.

218
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:50,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think they're funny.

219
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:52,516
[SPEAKER_11]: You just want to murder bunnies.

220
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how you are.

221
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Cute animals need to die.

222
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:55,617
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

223
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, every time we bring up Super Smash Bros.

224
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:04,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl, folks in the chatroom start talking about what characters they want to see in it.

225
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Yuri Lever talking about Katamari.

226
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,658
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be an interesting third-party thing.

227
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:14,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the only thing about that is they've said that it hasn't been on the system already, so probably not.

228
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:21,665
[SPEAKER_11]: PooEater says the Jet Set guy, he could spray your face, but again, also not on any Nintendo system.

229
00:19:22,105 --> 00:19:23,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I still say Sonica.

230
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:26,844
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Sonic and Bonk are actually the ones I'm thinking.

231
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:33,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's a good point, especially with the recent Genesis and TurboGrafx love, thanks to the virtual console.

232
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,467
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a brilliant idea.

233
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:35,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope it happens.

234
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:39,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway, DarkSakura.

235
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:40,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah!

236
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,030
[SPEAKER_11]: We get letters once in a while, right?

237
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?

238
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they send them to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

239
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Real quick last thought, sorry.

240
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:48,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Nestor and Howard.

241
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:49,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

242
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:52,599
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little too old school for most people, I think.

243
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:56,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember Nestor and Howard.

244
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the Mega Man one that went on for like three issues.

245
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:01,062
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was great.

246
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we ever get emails about Nestor and Howard?

247
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:03,744
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

248
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:04,364
[SPEAKER_11]: We should.

249
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:06,465
[SPEAKER_11]: People should email us their favorite memories.

250
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:11,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, DarkSakura, tell us about what they're emailing us about at MailbagAtOrangeLawnTrader.com this week.

251
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Our listeners are very emo.

252
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to start from the beginning.

253
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:27,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one from DJ Ratchet, who's been on our boards for quite a while.

254
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to go ahead and read this.

255
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:32,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been behind on your podcast and I've been listening to a few of the slightly older episodes.

256
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few responses to some of the things said.

257
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:39,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, congrats on Loki for getting married, even though everyone said it a hundred times.

258
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,580
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just OLR with the Sony hate.

259
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much every other podcast I've listened to has nothing but bad things to say about Sony.

260
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:48,323
[SPEAKER_01]: At least you guys are trying to be fair.

261
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are being real fanboyish about the whole thing.

262
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the suckers who are going to get a PS3 though.

263
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,632
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying, guys.

264
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:58,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really trying to be devil's advocate when it comes to Sony, but...

265
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:00,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, it's tough.

266
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:04,144
[SPEAKER_11]: And even the Sony fanboys have to recognize right now the odds are not in your favor.

267
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:04,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

268
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:07,525
[SPEAKER_01]: The system is only as good as the games on it.

269
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:10,087
[SPEAKER_11]: E3 was not a good setup for Sony fanboys.

270
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:10,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

271
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,347
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do what we can the rest of the year.

272
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:16,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Sony will throw us a few frickin' bones before Christmas, or the launch of the system, really.

273
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,770
[SPEAKER_01]: They had cool commercials, though.

274
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess there's something.

275
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,012
[SPEAKER_11]: If they get Castlevania, that's a huge plus.

276
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:25,073
[SPEAKER_01]: To return to the email.

277
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:28,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Harmonix does need to make another Amplitude frequency game.

278
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:30,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still hooked to those games.

279
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:32,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero looks like Amplitude with a guitar peripheral and nothing else.

280
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,932
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason I have not bought Guitar Hero.

281
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:36,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick question.

282
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:39,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Space Channel 5 Special Edition for the PS2 a straight port of the Dreamcast version?

283
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:41,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm considering buying it.

284
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:45,538
[SPEAKER_01]: To answer the question, actually it's both.

285
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,880
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Space Channel 5 2 and the Dreamcast 1.

286
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I own it.

287
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not played it yet because I have the Japanese Space Channel 5 2.

288
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,302
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

289
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:24,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, another thing that he wanted to add is that his mother, who knows nothing about video games, thinks that the Blu-ray is the biggest ripoff in the world.

290
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the players are like, I don't know, $700 or something, right?

291
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:30,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that was something I saw this week.

292
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:35,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw an HD DVD player in action at Best Buy or something.

293
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:37,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

294
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:40,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Not ready to drop $1,000 on it, that's for sure.

295
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:40,265
$600?

296
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:41,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

297
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:53,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, $360 if they're going to release that, they're going to have to do it like $200 at most for that player for me to be interested in it because the picture quality is not that much better.

298
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:01,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And if Blu-ray is only supposed to look that good, I am not impressed with the technology at this time.

299
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,011
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think there's going to be... It's not that huge of an improvement over...

300
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:12,663
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another email from Mark from Australia.

301
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:17,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting email.

302
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and read this out loud.

303
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:26,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just finished listening to episode 187 and once again I hear you guys defending violent content in video games.

304
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:32,190
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be a topic that is forever raising its ugly head in almost every single show.

305
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, although I'm a gamer and particularly love violent content in the games I play, I find your arguments always seem to be one-sided.

306
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:45,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard anyone from Orange Lounge Radio seriously and intelligently consider whether it's bad for kids, or more so, if it's bad for adults.

307
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, can simulated killing really be good for your head?

308
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki asks the question, what's worse, simulated killing or killing a deer?

309
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:58,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Loki has no idea about the answer to this question, but proceeds to speak in a high-pitched voice mimicking the mothers of the affected kids.

310
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,496
[SPEAKER_01]: His only objective is to try to offend them.

311
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:04,499
[SPEAKER_01]: If he calmed down and put some thought into his answers, he might seem credible.

312
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:19,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually responded to him and in my email I said that the viewpoint we've been coming from is more on the rebuttal standpoint where we're given a limited scope of what to defend.

313
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:26,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we have all these people and I honestly think that the ones that are saying, you know, ban it, ban it, ban it, are...

314
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:31,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Very one-sided, very, you know, not willing to put a lot of thought into it.

315
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:32,632
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I fully agree.

316
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:34,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually said this in the past.

317
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:35,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it today.

318
00:24:35,894 --> 00:24:42,018
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is a certain age where you have to be careful with what you expose your children to.

319
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:54,626
[SPEAKER_01]: But any, I should say, mature adult, any person who's above a certain age and has a certain ability to tell reality from...

320
00:24:56,225 --> 00:25:12,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantasy would be able to intelligently know the difference between picking up your controller and killing a bunch of pixels or 3D rendered models than taking an Uzi and blowing away your school.

321
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that an intelligent, sane human being would be able to tell the difference.

322
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:21,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I absolutely agree with that.

323
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:24,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the listener who wrote us an email said,

324
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

325
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:50,484
[SPEAKER_11]: To play this game that I'm going to buy for them with my money.

326
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,786
[SPEAKER_11]: And certainly there are some games that some children should not be playing.

327
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,747
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's really up to the parent to make the decision there.

328
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:58,908
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of just my thoughts on it.

329
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have anything you want to say about the mom impressions or whatever?

330
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:03,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

331
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,214
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty, any idiot can tell you that.

332
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:34,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if I kill, you know, a virtual hooker, I guess, it's not a real person.

333
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,176
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have feelings.

334
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:41,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Their family's not going to worry about, you know, they're not going to be all upset if I kill her.

335
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,579
[SPEAKER_09]: She just respawns later and I go kill her again.

336
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:44,400
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

337
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas, you know, if I go kill, you know, my next door neighbor, that's a little different.

338
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:51,002
[SPEAKER_09]: More people are impacted by that.

339
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:55,924
[SPEAKER_09]: So how can you say that I'm wrong in saying that killing a virtual person is

340
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:00,336
[SPEAKER_09]: No where near to the effect of killing something real.

341
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it's not a human person, say you kill

342
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:05,162
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, an animal or something.

343
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:09,504
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, kids are brought up knowing that animals are cute and stuff.

344
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:23,169
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you take them out into the wilderness without obviously educating them and stuff, and you go and blow away Bambi, I mean, that's going to be a little, you know, that's going to probably shock them more than saying, killing virtual, you know, prostitute Betty.

345
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:23,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

346
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:33,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, speaking of that, you know, what's worse, going out and killing a deer for the sport of it or killing a deer because you're hungry and you need food?

347
00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:38,725
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that there's, I think everything is situational, okay?

348
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:45,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what about, say someone has broken into your house and has a gun at your head, I'm going to shoot them, okay?

349
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:49,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care, I will do what it takes to defend my house.

350
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:54,829
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are in my property, and they're threatening to kill me, hell yeah, I would strike out at them.

351
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:58,030
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to be going a little into the what ifs.

352
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Firebomber was pointing out that I'm at Ted Nugent's level.

353
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I killed deers in Deer Hunter 3

354
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:07,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the email.

355
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:11,162
[SPEAKER_11]: We like thought-provoking, intelligently written emails.

356
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:17,184
[SPEAKER_01]: In a year, I'm planning on having a sproutlet.

357
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:19,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm planning on breeding.

358
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:19,504
[SPEAKER_11]: A spawn.

359
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:20,425
[SPEAKER_01]: A spawn of Jamie.

360
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:30,865
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'm not going to have my little kid going out and playing Halo when he's three or four.

361
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:45,935
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when I'm sure that my kid understands the difference between reality and fantasy, then I wouldn't mind if they're in there watching me play Halo as long as they understand the difference.

362
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:49,238
[SPEAKER_01]: If they start reenacting it, they get their butt popped and I tell them no.

363
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:50,604
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

364
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:19,747
[SPEAKER_01]: It is your responsibility to make sure that they learn how to be a proper adult.

365
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Childhood is what prepares you for being a grown-up.

366
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:24,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

367
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you might get more letters from this one.

368
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I want more letters!

369
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,452
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as they're intelligently written, that's all we ask.

370
00:30:29,512 --> 00:30:30,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and have good grammar.

371
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:35,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an email from Cameron.

372
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,663
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, hey, I was wondering your thoughts on Banjo-Kazooie for DS.

373
00:30:40,143 --> 00:30:47,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare is already porting Diddy Kong Racing from the 64 DS and EGM rumored that a Banjo-Kazooie game was also coming to DS as a port or new.

374
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if you think it will happen.

375
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:53,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, do you think any Banjo-Kazooie games will make it to live arcade?

376
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:54,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you for the show.

377
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:56,717
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I won't make it to live arcade because...

378
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:01,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, does Nintendo still have part of the rights on that?

379
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, when it comes to Banjo-Kazooie, who technically owns that?

380
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:05,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Rare or Nintendo?

381
00:31:06,056 --> 00:31:15,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Rare has it, then definitely, I don't think you'd see it on DS at all for that reason, but Xbox Live Arcade, definite possibility, but not for a long time.

382
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:21,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly didn't like the Banjo-Kazooie series, so I haven't... Yeah, I gotta be honest, it wasn't really a series of games I played a whole lot of.

383
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Magus, you seem to be a little more up on the know on that, do you have any thoughts?

384
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no, I haven't played Banjo-Kazooie since it came out.

385
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this listener's going to be very disappointed in our feedback on that one.

386
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:34,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

387
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:40,468
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if it's rare, though, I think rare Microsoft's really where they're headed.

388
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:40,808
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't...

389
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:42,362
[SPEAKER_11]: D.S.

390
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:42,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Diddy Kong

391
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:18,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, I need more time to think about that.

392
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Worst experience at a video game store?

393
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say it was EB before the games got merged.

394
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:29,476
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some really not knowledgeable people at a couple of the EVs I've been to.

395
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:32,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had a problem at a GameStop, but then again, they all know me.

396
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:35,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you're kind of lucky in that regard.

397
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:41,661
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I would say, more recently, this is kind of a weak answer, but I didn't have a lot of time to think about this one.

398
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:50,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Walking into a gaming store time and time again, not being able to locate an Xbox 360 for many months, and kind of being laughed at when asking about it.

399
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:53,165
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know, come on, guys.

400
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:54,396
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

401
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:20,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the... No, Julie was with me.

402
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:21,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't recall it.

403
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:28,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Julie was with me because we were picking up one before some convention and no one was coming.

404
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,316
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked people, oh, I don't know, I don't have a key, and they weren't finding anyone, but that was Walmart.

405
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:33,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have any stories?

406
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:34,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Magus, anybody?

407
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:42,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say... There was one time I was buying that memory card thing, kind of like a...

408
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:49,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you can rip memory card saves off of like a Playstation card

409
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:52,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like a dextro, but not as a third-party thing.

410
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And... The guy was acting stupid.

411
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:58,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what he was doing.

412
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,790
[SPEAKER_09]: He was acting really retarded.

413
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,791
[SPEAKER_09]: But then there was another time I was trying to buy a PSP at launch.

414
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:04,972
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, good luck finding one!

415
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:05,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha ha!

416
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:07,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It went to Best Buy, and there was like a ton of them sitting there.

417
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:10,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

418
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:15,516
[SPEAKER_09]: But I remember, like I said last week, I overheard in one of the GameStops that they don't even...

419
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:21,494
[SPEAKER_09]: inform their employees on what games are coming out and what the games are.

420
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:24,517
[SPEAKER_09]: They basically are told to read the Game Informer magazine.

421
00:34:25,618 --> 00:34:27,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, that's stupid.

422
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:29,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Eh, whatever.

423
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:32,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Magus?

424
00:34:32,644 --> 00:34:33,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine's more of a general thing.

425
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:39,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, okay, tip to GameStop, EB Games, whatever.

426
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:41,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Your employees...

427
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:43,721
[SPEAKER_08]: are selling games.

428
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:47,386
[SPEAKER_08]: They should know something about the games they're selling.

429
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:53,836
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a person that's completely clueless, you don't employ them or you have them learn first, right?

430
00:34:54,646 --> 00:35:04,632
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I understand from GameStop employees I've talked to, at least that chain, GameStop, has a policy where they can get magazines for free to read up on what's going on.

431
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:07,834
[SPEAKER_11]: How many employees take advantage of that or whether they're encouraged to, I don't know.

432
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:08,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't worked there.

433
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:11,416
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do know at least they have that policy, which is interesting.

434
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:23,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm probably going to have to second the issue with employees mocking customers who didn't pre-order their product and then are surprised that it's not in stock.

435
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:29,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we know we can't always pre-order things, but you don't have to get in our face for it.

436
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:31,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I think that

437
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:37,911
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know something's going to be hard to get and you want to make sure you have your copy, freaking pre-order it.

438
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:44,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $5 out of your pocket, and if it turns out it's something that you don't want, you can move it to something else.

439
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard.

440
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:47,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't agree.

441
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:53,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't pre-order games, and I don't like that kind of commitment, and I feel like it's almost like I don't want to commit that I'm going to buy.

442
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:54,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

443
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:55,417
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not committing that you're buying it.

444
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:55,957
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $60.

445
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,018
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not committing... $60, that's a hell of a commitment.

446
00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:58,278
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not...

447
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:00,638
[SPEAKER_01]: For a game, it's $5.

448
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:01,739
[SPEAKER_09]: For a game, it's $5.

449
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,679
[SPEAKER_09]: What about a game system?

450
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Games are easy to come by.

451
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want it, you can get your money back.

452
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that hard.

453
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:15,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like those stores try to force me into it.

454
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:16,482
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the whole thing.

455
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:19,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like being told I have to do something.

456
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:19,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody does.

457
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:23,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I pre-ordered my Xbox 360 system about...

458
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:29,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that they're responsible for Microsoft's error?

459
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:35,496
[SPEAKER_09]: They did take the number of pre-orders that they thought they were getting systems and then Microsoft screwed them over.

460
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:39,763
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

461
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, that's called stupid customer That's called the customer is a lazy ass

462
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:23,063
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's up to the retailer to inform their customers.

463
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:25,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Inform them exactly the source.

464
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, they had shortages before with the PlayStation 2.

465
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,316
[SPEAKER_09]: If they knew that this was going to be a typical problem, they could say, you know what...

466
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:39,813
[SPEAKER_01]: How is what one company do illustrate what another company is going to do?

467
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:41,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Please answer that.

468
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:48,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me exactly how is the behavior of a completely different entity going to explain how another completely different entity is going to perform.

469
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,601
[SPEAKER_09]: The companies operate in a similar fashion as far as hardware launches.

470
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:52,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

471
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:57,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Microsoft doesn't have to deal with having their orders come from basically a foreign source.

472
00:37:58,085 --> 00:38:01,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft is all located this side of the country.

473
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:04,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that Sony does has to have approval from Sony of Japan.

474
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:09,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Microsoft Systems, I believe, were being manufactured in foreign countries.

475
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:11,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter where it's manufactured.

476
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,257
[SPEAKER_01]: It matters where the business decisions are being made.

477
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:16,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, to go on to the next email.

478
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:20,119
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have one from Ricky.

479
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, one of our 15-year-old listeners...

480
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:29,929
[SPEAKER_01]: says he's been listening to our show for the past two years and he's quite impressed.

481
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to the point is what it says.

482
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:41,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was browsing around on the net and I stumbled across a gif which happened to be someone's avatar for a certain forum from the image of this year's E3.

483
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:42,638
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Ken Kutaragi.

484
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, he did spell it right.

485
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Kudos to you.

486
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:50,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Mouthing his mouth to the phrase Ridge Racer and it kept playing the words back and forth.

487
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:53,946
[SPEAKER_01]: He recognized a face in this

488
00:38:58,231 --> 00:39:02,513
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that none other... It actually said it was Rob in this GIF.

489
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:04,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've actually... You know what?

490
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:10,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody posted something similar in our forums that supposedly there's some reaction shot of me at some press conference.

491
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:11,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, guys.

492
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:12,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not me.

493
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:13,918
[SPEAKER_11]: At least the picture I saw wasn't me.

494
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:16,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess... I didn't even think the guy looked like me, but...

495
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:33,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried going into the mailbag and looking at it and there was no GIF image attached so I would ask that listener to try resending it but just so you know when the Sony press conference was going on we were not there we were not at any of the big three press conferences I wish we were that popular amongst them

496
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:39,489
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately, not all those companies have embraced podcasting yet, with the exception of Microsoft.

497
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:51,319
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, you know, Major Nelson works for them, so that's the podcast that's definitely going to be... Actually, I would say Microsoft a little more than the others, you know, even because I know some other friendly podcasts we know of went to that conference, so that's cool.

498
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,044
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, regardless, during the Sony Prep Conference, we were actually at the...

499
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:06,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Arena Lounge in Santa Monica watching it on the big screen TV on a live feed and nobody was taking pictures of our reaction shots.

500
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:13,447
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, I didn't have a problem with Sony's conference until the very end, to be honest.

501
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:16,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And then kind of sitting back and reflecting on it, it just kind of got worse.

502
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:20,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really don't think that picture's me because I don't know where it came from.

503
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:22,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like eating bad McDonald's.

504
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:25,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It was bad to begin with and then it just kind of festers in your stomach.

505
00:40:25,938 --> 00:40:32,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I spent most of E3 hanging out with either Loki, DarkSakura, or Bobby from All Games.

506
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you don't see them in the picture either, it's probably not me.

507
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:37,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

508
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:40,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we got an email and I'm using this as an example.

509
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:44,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone sent us an email that consists of only, Hi.

510
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:48,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't send me emails that just say, Hi.

511
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:55,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I'm going to do in the future when I see emails like this is I'm going to delete it and keep a list of your name.

512
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:59,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hi back, I guess.

513
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:03,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you taking the time to send such a thoughtful and well-written email.

514
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not mentioning the person's name on.

515
00:41:06,336 --> 00:41:07,877
[SPEAKER_01]: They also didn't put a subject in there.

516
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:08,878
[SPEAKER_01]: All they wrote was, Hi.

517
00:41:11,826 --> 00:41:13,990
[SPEAKER_11]: You know now we're going to get like 30 emails this week.

518
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Just say hi, hi, hi.

519
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I will do is on our form, I will post their email address.

520
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,082
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

521
00:41:20,503 --> 00:41:23,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we can sign them up for some porn filters.

522
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:30,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you really need it by posting them to the forum and probably just do that automatically with all those bots out there.

523
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is that.

524
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:34,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other emails besides the hi mail?

525
00:41:34,714 --> 00:41:37,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the ones that worship me as their goddess.

526
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:39,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Those I usually just send to my personal email.

527
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:41,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, all one of those emails.

528
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

529
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:47,166
[SPEAKER_01]: You can shut the hell up right now.

530
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:48,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Meg has got a total zing there.

531
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:50,382
[SPEAKER_11]: You sent yourself.

532
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:51,303
[SPEAKER_01]: That is bull.

533
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:52,443
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband sent them.

534
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:55,264
[SPEAKER_11]: DMM, I need some ATH points for Magus.

535
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,484
[SPEAKER_11]: A good five points for him, please.

536
00:41:56,624 --> 00:41:57,084
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

537
00:41:57,124 --> 00:42:03,326
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to... I think he's upgraded from toilet paper to a cardboard box for his joke book.

538
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:04,406
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

539
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:05,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we've got to keep it moving here.

540
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:09,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, if you have emails, mail back at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

541
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:15,669
[SPEAKER_11]: During the break here, live only, we were talking about some gaming pieces that were in the media recently.

542
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:18,390
[SPEAKER_11]: One piece we were saving here for Part B was

543
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:19,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Nightline.

544
00:42:22,314 --> 00:42:28,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically what happened is that Nightline recently did this story here talking about

545
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:37,367
[SPEAKER_11]: The Pentagon, and how kind of dumb they looked when they mistook a bit of Mashima for a terrorist training tool and showed it to the House Intelligence Committee.

546
00:42:38,628 --> 00:42:52,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Tapper basically said this, terrorists twisting an American video game into a jihadist training tool, and then proceeds to lay out how the whole thing happened, including getting an anonymous interview with a European gamer who created the now infamous terrorist battlefield clip.

547
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:57,490
[SPEAKER_11]: The Pentagon is still claiming that the Moshima is being used by terrorists.

548
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:03,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Tapper is calling bullshit on this excuse and tells the Pentagon so, basically.

549
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:10,498
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a quote here, We should really be questioning the kind of advice that Congress is getting.

550
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:16,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And that comes from Georgia Tech Ian Boggist, who's in the piece.

551
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:21,526
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a parody of Team America World Police.

552
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:24,135
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the Machimo is.

553
00:43:25,256 --> 00:43:26,317
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very interesting.

554
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:28,358
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

555
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,079
[SPEAKER_09]: That was interesting, you know.

556
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid intelligence.

557
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:47,852
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, kind of unrelated to that whole thing, the Frag Dolls and the PMS Clan, they're boycotting the World Series of Video Gaming Girl Love, I guess, contest or whatever.

558
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:51,474
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing some pageant contest that has to do with the World Series of Video Games.

559
00:43:51,815 --> 00:43:52,135
[SPEAKER_09]: The Miss...

560
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:54,874
[SPEAKER_09]: WSVG Contest

561
00:44:11,503 --> 00:44:13,245
[SPEAKER_09]: PMS Amber Dalton Courier Journal

562
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:44,202
[SPEAKER_09]: and basically, I don't know, one of the funny things I keep seeing back is the, like for example, the World Series of Video Gaming they shot back with.

563
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:52,988
[SPEAKER_09]: The Frag Dolls and PMS Clan have stated that they plan to run the Mr. WSVG competition in the Taurus Next Stop in Dallas.

564
00:44:53,568 --> 00:45:02,414
[SPEAKER_09]: If this happens, in order to be fair, the World Series of Video Gaming may feel compelled to run another beauty contest as well.

565
00:45:02,754 --> 00:45:08,980
[SPEAKER_09]: and then of course other gamers who have been reading this are saying, well, those two clans suck anyways as far as gaming goes.

566
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,322
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't even compete on a professional level.

567
00:45:12,924 --> 00:45:14,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought that was funny.

568
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:24,795
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really know enough about those clans to pass judgment on it, so I'm just going to refrain from commenting, although I would love to have a representative on the program at some point to kind of give their perspective.

569
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:39,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that they've been giving a lot of shit online about how many I think the PMS clan specifically they have their gamer cards linked on Xbox.com and I think like most of them have under 1k points except one girl's got a ton

570
00:45:39,687 --> 00:45:42,589
[SPEAKER_11]: But then they say, well that's because we're playing Halo 2 and you don't get points for that.

571
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:57,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they have Halo 2, but the other thing I thought was funny was... And with all respect to them, because again, I don't know them, it does seem interesting though, they are linked from Xbox.com, wouldn't you, knowing that, want to buff up the 360 games?

572
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:58,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

573
00:45:58,697 --> 00:46:06,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they play Halo 2 a lot, granted, and one of the funny things I was reading is that they're actually coming out with...

574
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:11,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Their casual gaming portion of the clan.

575
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's going to be some experts at Uno or something.

576
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:14,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

577
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:18,038
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm all for a casual game.

578
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:18,939
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to be hardcore all the time.

579
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:19,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought that was funny though.

580
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to be entering the Hotman competition, Loki?

581
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:23,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you should be in it.

582
00:46:24,986 --> 00:46:25,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be funny.

583
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:27,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know they're going to get all these male models.

584
00:46:27,948 --> 00:46:28,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the problem, though.

585
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:30,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Loki should be up there.

586
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:30,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the problem, though.

587
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:31,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in Dallas.

588
00:46:32,312 --> 00:46:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's also... They're a ways away.

589
00:46:35,855 --> 00:46:36,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat room?

590
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:39,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should have someone go in there in an asbestos suit and set themselves on fire.

591
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Chat room?

592
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Who would like to contribute to a Send Loki to Dallas fund?

593
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:48,225
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd win, Loki.

594
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:53,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Our other sales branch is in Dallas.

595
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:54,670
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

596
00:46:55,727 --> 00:46:56,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

597
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:57,068
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to take a work trip.

598
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:03,392
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the whole argument with the fact that they don't have a lot of game points doesn't really count with me.

599
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:09,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I mean, if you're playing a lot of multiplayer games and stuff, not a lot of points may be coming from that.

600
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:24,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if you're not playing, like, you know, which, although, although, the PMS clan, I think it was the PMS clan, I can't remember which one's sponsored by Ubisoft, they have, they better be, you know, have a high achievement.

601
00:47:25,203 --> 00:47:27,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I have nothing against female clans.

602
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if they're competing out there, great.

603
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:29,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Just

604
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:52,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

605
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:56,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just don't, you know, make it sound like you're the best people in the world.

606
00:47:57,282 --> 00:47:59,464
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have, like, the O.L.

607
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:00,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Army as a gaming clan.

608
00:48:01,186 --> 00:48:01,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought about that.

609
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:03,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Except they suck.

610
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:05,810
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of girls that listen to this show.

611
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,171
[SPEAKER_01]: For just various games.

612
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:14,718
[SPEAKER_11]: That aren't your supermodel girl types that Microsoft would want to flaunt about at their booth or whatever.

613
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:15,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just fine by me.

614
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:16,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I like my girls normal.

615
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that I date girls, but I like socializing with normal girls.

616
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I say we form a clan and all that stuff.

617
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:26,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.

618
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:27,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Send some emails.

619
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:32,292
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested, send emails to mailbag at orangezonesradio.com It's not just women.

620
00:48:32,332 --> 00:48:34,592
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have a clan on Chromehounds.

621
00:48:34,672 --> 00:48:37,853
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be the multi-game clan.

622
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:39,093
[SPEAKER_01]: The OL Army.

623
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:41,753
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have actual clans in Chromehounds.

624
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:44,414
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have the OL Army.

625
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:46,696
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyway, let's move on here.

626
00:48:46,736 --> 00:48:48,737
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to get to the story about the PSP.

627
00:49:06,304 --> 00:49:08,566
[SPEAKER_11]: into PSP friendly formats.

628
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:12,129
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, you can also convert it for iPod or Trio.

629
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:21,397
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only going to cost $25 for that functionality, which, by the way, you can find utilities on the internet to do it for free, but okay, whatever.

630
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:27,403
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a legal and blessed thing from TiVo, so it's kind of interesting because now the PSP can kind of have that

631
00:49:27,984 --> 00:49:30,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, put your TiVo programs here on your PSP.

632
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:38,668
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be something to sell the PSP and certainly make it more competitive with the iPod, even though, I don't know, iPod and PSP are so different anyway.

633
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:44,750
[SPEAKER_11]: But for some people, when it's one or the other, that might be something that kind of, you know, makes the PSP look a little more alluring too.

634
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:57,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just that they're going to be planning on doing this anyways with the whole PS3 and their, you know, was it their wireless streaming system that they've got there?

635
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:01,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny Depp is doing his, uh, lending his voice talent to the game for Captain Jack Sparrow.

636
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:01,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

637
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:01,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

638
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that game I thought was pretty cool.

639
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,732
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it had all kinds of little hidden stuff thrown in it.

640
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:36,856
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what I did notice, you know, remember though that they didn't have a dude in it.

641
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is the name suddenly escaping me?

642
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:42,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

643
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:43,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny Depp, thank you.

644
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,020
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

645
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Orlando Bloom?

646
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:45,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Orlando Bloom, thank you.

647
00:50:47,282 --> 00:50:47,783
[SPEAKER_01]: He isn't.

648
00:50:47,823 --> 00:50:51,545
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually got a voice, a similar voice to it.

649
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:53,646
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a...

650
00:50:55,726 --> 00:51:05,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Quote on here from Johnny Depp said, Doing voiceovers is a great fun and a lot easier than stumbling about pretending to be Keith Richards or having scissors glued to your fingers all day.

651
00:51:07,015 --> 00:51:07,835
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not add.

652
00:51:09,256 --> 00:51:14,400
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, all things considered, the game looked decent.

653
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,521
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't a quote, by the way.

654
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:15,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

655
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:16,762
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked...

656
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:22,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Your typical movie to game translation, but they didn't fuck it up.

657
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,598
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory games, they didn't fuck it up.

658
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:26,879
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked pretty solid.

659
00:51:27,439 --> 00:51:30,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the Johnny Depp quotient is going to sell a lot more of this title.

660
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was a smart clinching there to get the game on board.

661
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:38,022
[SPEAKER_01]: This announcement here is from Eurogamer, so I love the jokes they're putting in here.

662
00:51:38,582 --> 00:51:41,143
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, they said, why are pirates called pirates?

663
00:51:41,243 --> 00:51:42,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are.

664
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:44,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

665
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:45,904
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so bad.

666
00:51:46,705 --> 00:51:47,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

667
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:49,212
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fantastic.

668
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,073
[SPEAKER_11]: That was bad.

669
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:13,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, as far as Xbox Live, there's going to be some demos coming soon.

670
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:22,802
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one, of course, which should have come out by now but hasn't, Prey, is supposed to be hitting Xbox Live Arcade, or Xbox Live's Marketplace, pretty soon.

671
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:31,146
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't wait, though, and you have a decent enough PC, you can actually download the PC demo for free on a lot of the major gaming sites, so definitely check that out.

672
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:33,947
[SPEAKER_09]: The other demo is also slated for August 1st,

673
00:52:34,747 --> 00:52:35,267
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

674
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:05,756
[SPEAKER_11]: All over and tries to find the website that you need to be looking at this week.

675
00:53:06,156 --> 00:53:08,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So DarkSakura, where should kids be pointing their browsers this week?

676
00:53:11,277 --> 00:53:18,278
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a site that I spend quite a bit of time on and it's not actually just because I also moderate there.

677
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:20,919
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Gorilla Zone Official.

678
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:28,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a big fan of this site before I was asked on as one of the moderators there.

679
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:30,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, this site

680
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:36,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, 2J, he's so amazing with how quickly he gets the updates up.

681
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:41,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Any new information that he has up on there, they're linked through LiveJournal.

682
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:48,032
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add Gorillas News to your LiveJournal feed, it goes directly off GorillasUnofficial.com.

683
00:53:48,072 --> 00:53:49,913
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually Gorillas-Unofficial.com.

684
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,613
[SPEAKER_01]: The forums there are great, well-maintained.

685
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:55,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not just because I'm also working there, too.

686
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:58,736
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody there is just really terrific.

687
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:09,665
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just that, but if you go into the site, actually on the splash page there's new art features by people in the fan art community.

688
00:54:12,944 --> 00:54:14,445
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see something different every time.

689
00:54:14,905 --> 00:54:22,371
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, this has probably, I'd say, one of the most complete lyrics, image, discography, everything.

690
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:33,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's even a translation on here by my friend Haruna, who translated what Noodle said on the Apex tapes back when she was only speaking Japanese.

691
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.

692
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:36,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool site.

693
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:38,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been impressed with them from day one.

694
00:54:39,284 --> 00:54:40,305
[SPEAKER_11]: But what if I don't like gorillas?

695
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:41,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Then screw you.

696
00:54:41,906 --> 00:54:42,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

697
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:42,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

698
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:44,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Then why don't you?

699
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:45,688
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with you?

700
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I like gorillas just fine.

701
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,331
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I love to be devil's advocate though.

702
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:49,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

703
00:55:17,202 --> 00:55:18,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really want to comment on that game.

704
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:26,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, what's kind of interesting is they described the brand new damage system in Forza 2.

705
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:34,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is all coming from the latest issue of the 360 Magazine, including that it took six months to create.

706
00:55:35,314 --> 00:55:41,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Three damage settings will be available in the game, low, normal, and simulation, for those who don't want to...

707
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:43,590
[SPEAKER_09]: They joke.

708
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Reenact the great Gizmondo Ferrari crash.

709
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:55,595
[SPEAKER_09]: For photo and TV modes, they're actually collaborating with the Project Gotham development team, Bizarre Creations.

710
00:55:55,995 --> 00:56:03,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're going to have something similar to Forza TV, very similar to Gotham TV that was in Project Gotham Racing 3.

711
00:56:04,238 --> 00:56:09,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, better AI, better graphics, downloadable content, yadda yadda yadda yadda.

712
00:56:11,055 --> 00:56:12,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard's got some new ideas for World of Warcraft

713
00:56:38,826 --> 00:56:39,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

714
00:56:40,327 --> 00:56:40,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.

715
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:55,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, they're preparing a new transfer system that will let World of Warcraft players move their characters to less polluted realms for a $25 fee.

716
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:07,564
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically wanting to offer these services for convenience as opposed to encouraging people to spread out through the realms.

717
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:09,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

718
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:10,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

719
00:57:35,373 --> 00:57:40,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the alternative is just to re-roll in completely new characters, so it's not much of a decision there.

720
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:45,316
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be restrictions on realm transfers.

721
00:57:45,977 --> 00:57:51,718
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only bring a character once every six months, and once you've transferred, you can't take them back.

722
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:53,619
[SPEAKER_01]: The character has to be at least level 10.

723
00:57:54,279 --> 00:57:59,861
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the amount of cash you can bring with you, 300 gold for levels 10 through 30, 1,000 for 31 through 50, and 5,000 through 51 and above.

724
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,309
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only transfer to realms of the same type.

725
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:10,753
[SPEAKER_01]: PvP, PvE, I guess roleplay ones too.

726
00:58:12,474 --> 00:58:16,778
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also talking about Cross Realm Battlegrounds feature that's coming in with Patch 1.12.

727
00:58:16,818 --> 00:58:18,920
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

728
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:26,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It will link Altric Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so you can fight with players from other realms.

729
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:30,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully they don't link the fucking Looking for Group channel across multiple servers.

730
00:58:30,629 --> 00:58:32,051
[SPEAKER_11]: LFG, WSG...

731
00:58:33,735 --> 00:58:36,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, okay, devil's advocate here.

732
00:58:37,258 --> 00:58:44,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, so we can have our blue bee groups trashed by tier three, no matter where they are.

733
00:58:45,425 --> 00:59:02,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what are the odds, you figure, of Cross Realm Battlegrounds having, okay, you have this basic pickup group, unskilled players facing completely organized over voice chat people are just going to roll straight over them.

734
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:10,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Same rule on Ragnarok, you know, if you don't wanna, you know, you don't do War of Imperium if you're level 10.

735
00:59:10,574 --> 00:59:13,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Step up or ship out, bitch!

736
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:16,996
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a big gap between raiders and non-raiders, and you see that a lot on the forums.

737
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:21,557
[SPEAKER_08]: The people who do the big raid instances do better in PvP.

738
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:23,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not much a matter of skill.

739
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:27,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they should call it World of Warcraft Hardcore Edition.

740
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:28,619
[SPEAKER_11]: This is for the hardcore.

741
00:59:29,341 --> 00:59:36,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Patch 1.12 is going to bring in a new type of world PvP.

742
00:59:36,683 --> 00:59:42,424
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see Horde and Alliance players trying to gain control of strategic positions.

743
00:59:43,024 --> 00:59:45,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rogues will get a talent review.

744
00:59:45,785 --> 00:59:49,946
[SPEAKER_08]: To this I say it's about damn time on both counts.

745
00:59:50,426 --> 00:59:52,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Rogues have needed a talent change for a while.

746
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:53,847
[SPEAKER_08]: They just need some tweaks.

747
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:56,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And world PvP, because of Battlegrounds, because...

748
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:01,933
[SPEAKER_08]: are actually objectives in Battlegrounds has effectively killed off world PvP.

749
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:04,614
[SPEAKER_08]: So both of those need a revamp.

750
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:05,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad they're getting them.

751
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:11,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Going back to the price for a minute for character transfer, I think $25 is fair, actually.

752
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:12,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I do agree.

753
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it makes sure that people really want to do it and it's not just people taking advantage of it.

754
01:00:16,642 --> 01:00:24,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Because even if it was $5, I think $25 means that it's only people who really want to be with their friends and really want to do it.

755
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Because otherwise...

756
01:00:25,606 --> 01:00:26,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

757
01:00:26,226 --> 01:00:27,307
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you doing over there, Loki?

758
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:27,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not.

759
01:00:53,965 --> 01:00:55,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Searching for Porn.

760
01:00:55,046 --> 01:00:55,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

761
01:00:55,687 --> 01:00:59,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to get my program newsletcher to work because it's not.

762
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:00,212
[SPEAKER_09]: It wants me to buy it.

763
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:00,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

764
01:01:00,812 --> 01:01:01,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to.

765
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:08,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, although if you don't want to buy stuff and you want to save some money, well, you're still going to have to buy stuff, but

766
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:08,919
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

767
01:01:37,711 --> 01:01:38,331
[SPEAKER_09]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

768
01:01:57,265 --> 01:01:59,388
[SPEAKER_11]: and just kind of our reasonings why we're doing it.

769
01:01:59,468 --> 01:02:03,594
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, we here at Orange Launch Radio do not like to edit the show unless we absolutely have to.

770
01:02:04,094 --> 01:02:07,338
[SPEAKER_11]: We would never edit out someone's opinion on anything.

771
01:02:07,378 --> 01:02:12,485
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing we edit out are complete fuck-ups like, you know, we forget to start the show right or whatever.

772
01:02:13,026 --> 01:02:15,329
[SPEAKER_11]: The story's not up that we need or what have you.

773
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:26,277
[SPEAKER_11]: and now though we're going to start editing out Skype calls that are not up to a certain quality standard and we don't want to scare you guys off from calling in.

774
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:27,337
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what we're trying to do.

775
01:02:27,698 --> 01:02:35,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We're never going to censor your opinions but the problem is just based on some feedback that we're getting from folks that are listening to the show and posting on the forums and talking to friends is that

776
01:02:36,138 --> 01:02:36,699
[SPEAKER_11]: www.DarkSakura.com

777
01:02:59,198 --> 01:02:59,719
[SPEAKER_11]: www.darksakura.com

778
01:03:16,078 --> 01:03:39,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can actually call in and leave us a voicemail And actually, what I'd like to know your opinions on this week for the voicemail We're going to start making this a regular segment I would really like to hear your voicemails later Actually, I'll give you the topic after the Skype calls Because then otherwise people want to call in and talk about it But we're going to have like a weekly topic to call in about So anyway, let's go to the phone's Skype line and see what you guys have to say

779
01:03:41,175 --> 01:03:42,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

780
01:03:42,376 --> 01:03:42,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

781
01:03:43,477 --> 01:03:44,057
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Ranma.

782
01:03:44,077 --> 01:03:44,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me now?

783
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:45,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course I can hear you.

784
01:03:45,998 --> 01:03:46,619
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Ranma?

785
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:47,099
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

786
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:48,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much.

787
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally recovered from Anime Next last weekend.

788
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:51,662
[SPEAKER_11]: From Anime Next?

789
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,182
[SPEAKER_11]: How was that?

790
01:03:52,883 --> 01:03:56,625
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun, but there was a lot of drama with the game room, but I'll save that for later.

791
01:03:56,785 --> 01:03:57,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, I want to hear it.

792
01:03:57,886 --> 01:03:59,187
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the drama in the game room?

793
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:01,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard of Desktop Arcade?

794
01:04:02,029 --> 01:04:02,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

795
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:04,484
[SPEAKER_11]: They were banned from Anime Next

796
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:19,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems that somebody stole their passes from last year, photocopied them, and went into the game room.

797
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:28,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems that the guy who runs the game room, Kevin, who's also known as Assembler, who owns Assembler.org, basically blacklisted them from the con.

798
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:35,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And whenever you mention it on the forums about why they weren't there, he will go in and edit your post and delete it as if it never existed.

799
01:04:37,137 --> 01:04:38,338
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little weird.

800
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:40,118
[SPEAKER_11]: That's almost a little too hardcore.

801
01:04:40,138 --> 01:04:43,179
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't post anything like why they're gone or whatever?

802
01:04:43,973 --> 01:04:44,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

803
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:47,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you ask them why or whatever, your post is deleted.

804
01:04:47,896 --> 01:04:48,576
[SPEAKER_07]: That's freaky.

805
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:49,997
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a KGB thing.

806
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:53,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I came very close to getting banned on the forums, but I stopped.

807
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:58,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if I got banned, I know senior staffs that would probably have his head on a fucking platter.

808
01:04:58,622 --> 01:05:02,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we make a call to Desktop Arcade, get one of them on the show, try to get their side of the story?

809
01:05:03,085 --> 01:05:03,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, why not?

810
01:05:03,826 --> 01:05:05,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I can arrange that.

811
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:05,847
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

812
01:05:05,927 --> 01:05:06,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Open invite.

813
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:07,348
[SPEAKER_11]: You tell them we want them.

814
01:05:07,448 --> 01:05:08,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to hear it.

815
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:09,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't you guys?

816
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:10,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I see heads.

817
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:11,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's hear it.

818
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, sorry buddy, what else is going on in Anime Next?

819
01:05:15,572 --> 01:05:16,492
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty fun.

820
01:05:17,673 --> 01:05:22,976
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hot as hell, but luckily my hotel was like 15 feet away from the expo center.

821
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:24,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It was huge, it was great.

822
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:27,218
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that really sucked was the acoustics.

823
01:05:28,479 --> 01:05:30,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm, what was wrong with the acoustics?

824
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, you know, hard to hear things and sound bouncing everywhere or what?

825
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:40,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, think of it as like a giant warehouse and they were dividing everything with these heavy curtains.

826
01:05:41,598 --> 01:05:43,680
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of cool video game related things did you see there?

827
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:47,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's a lot of anime, but since we're a gaming show, what kind of cool video game things did you see there?

828
01:05:48,564 --> 01:05:53,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too much, because I went into the game room, the funk just hit me and I passed out.

829
01:05:53,768 --> 01:06:03,517
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did go into the dealer's room and I did see some DS lights on imports, white PSPs, and I saw a lot of import games.

830
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:11,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronma, I was actually hanging out with my friend Julie yesterday and she's going to Anime Expo this year.

831
01:06:12,744 --> 01:06:15,086
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I see to go there this year is because Clamp's there.

832
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:18,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to go, but my wizard costume's not done.

833
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:24,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she's talking about buying some of those miniature bottles of Febreze to go around spraying the fanboy funk.

834
01:06:26,004 --> 01:06:26,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

835
01:06:43,306 --> 01:07:02,651
[SPEAKER_11]: It is important that you bathe on a regular basis, that you use soap to clean the germs off your body, and that you use something like deodorant, cologne, I don't know, something to make sure that you're going to smell unoffensive when you're in a room tightly packed, especially a hot room, as Ranma's telling us his con was pretty hot, around all these people.

836
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:08,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So please, don't give gamers a bad name, such as these folks at Anime Next, that were stinking up the room.

837
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:11,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Bathe regularly, and you know,

838
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:15,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring the smell of flowers into gaming rooms everywhere.

839
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:19,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on, go on.

840
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:28,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually met somebody at Anime Expo a few years ago who actually was one of those I'm going to sleep in the lobby of the hotel or in the movie room type people.

841
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:35,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Only he actually would go into the men's room and clean himself at the sink.

842
01:07:36,278 --> 01:07:37,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

843
01:07:37,506 --> 01:07:40,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Bandit in the chat room has the best idea ever for a cosplay.

844
01:07:41,048 --> 01:07:43,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone should dress up as a big bottle of Febreze.

845
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:45,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's one for you.

846
01:07:45,971 --> 01:07:51,635
[SPEAKER_07]: One anime con when they passed out their registration bags had little bars of soap in each of the bags.

847
01:07:51,895 --> 01:07:55,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't you know the people got pissed off and offended.

848
01:07:58,058 --> 01:08:00,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually like to quote my friend Megzi.

849
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:00,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

850
01:08:01,461 --> 01:08:01,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbo.

851
01:08:02,281 --> 01:08:03,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Horrible otaku body odor.

852
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:05,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would you be offended at that?

853
01:08:05,984 --> 01:08:07,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I look at it as a free gift.

854
01:08:07,285 --> 01:08:09,367
[SPEAKER_11]: People fucking steal hotel soap all the time.

855
01:08:09,947 --> 01:08:11,588
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I say the cons should do?

856
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:12,509
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

857
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:15,411
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have an anonymous shower room.

858
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:19,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Take one of the hotel rooms, someone just stands there with a sheet.

859
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:22,157
[SPEAKER_07]: You go in, sign it, take your shower, and leave.

860
01:08:22,177 --> 01:08:22,577
[SPEAKER_07]: 100% anonymous.

861
01:08:22,597 --> 01:08:22,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

862
01:08:25,714 --> 01:08:28,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway, we gotta wrap this up so we can get to another call.

863
01:08:28,616 --> 01:08:31,337
[SPEAKER_11]: But any other thoughts on the cons or gaming or what have you?

864
01:08:32,098 --> 01:08:33,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun overall.

865
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:35,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna post a couple of links and that's it.

866
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,560
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one's for Jamie.

867
01:08:37,181 --> 01:08:39,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma would have cosplay in full effect.

868
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:41,643
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a bunch of Ranma would have cosplays running around.

869
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:42,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

870
01:08:42,884 --> 01:08:44,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, thank you very much Ranma for the call.

871
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:45,466
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate it, okay?

872
01:08:45,626 --> 01:08:46,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, no problem.

873
01:08:46,866 --> 01:08:47,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Later, buddy.

874
01:08:47,827 --> 01:08:48,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

875
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:49,348
[SPEAKER_11]: We always like it when he calls in.

876
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,322
[SPEAKER_11]: DMN, I need some ATH points to Bandit.

877
01:08:53,402 --> 01:08:55,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's your contest, but Bandit, come on.

878
01:08:55,904 --> 01:08:56,944
[SPEAKER_11]: That was some points right there.

879
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:58,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to another phone call.

880
01:08:58,625 --> 01:08:59,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

881
01:08:59,906 --> 01:09:00,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

882
01:09:00,927 --> 01:09:02,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Sky.

883
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:02,748
[SPEAKER_11]: It's RavensDolphin.

884
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:03,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, RavensDolphin.

885
01:09:03,528 --> 01:09:04,209
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind, buddy?

886
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:05,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Phoenix Wright.

887
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Phoenix Wright.

888
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:09,452
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've kind of looked at this game a little bit.

889
01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:10,253
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of neat.

890
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you just recently started playing this game?

891
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:13,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of.

892
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:18,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought it for a week and I found it in EB for $30 and it rocks.

893
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:20,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucky you.

894
01:09:20,746 --> 01:09:22,127
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you like about Phoenix Wright?

895
01:09:22,987 --> 01:09:25,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just like that the music is great.

896
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:28,651
[SPEAKER_05]: When you nail someone, it goes like, Objection!

897
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:29,311
[SPEAKER_05]: You did this!

898
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, wait.

899
01:09:31,326 --> 01:09:34,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov just walked in the room, so I've got to put him on the spot here.

900
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:37,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov, you've been playing Phoenix Wright.

901
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:38,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished it.

902
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:41,130
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you love so much about the game?

903
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:43,151
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like playing Law and Order.

904
01:09:43,771 --> 01:09:45,031
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much what I like.

905
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:45,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny.

906
01:09:46,032 --> 01:09:47,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really funny.

907
01:09:47,372 --> 01:09:48,233
[SPEAKER_11]: What's so funny about it?

908
01:09:48,273 --> 01:09:49,553
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing funny about Law.

909
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:51,854
[SPEAKER_03]: The writing is really hilarious.

910
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:58,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And the names they come up with for the characters, like Law to Heart and Somebody Von Karma.

911
01:09:58,196 --> 01:09:58,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget his name.

912
01:10:00,257 --> 01:10:24,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Manfred Von Karma and it was seriously he's the one with the evil voice right objection it's i couldn't put it down until i finished it i have all these other games i was playing too i was like i'm not taking this out of my ds it just seems to me like that game is an awful lot of reading though so what keeps this game kind of guy interesting yes raven's dolphin uh because it has a lot of reading i i read pretty well i don't i can't read a

913
01:10:24,841 --> 01:10:26,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike Meekins You will find out once you play through it.

914
01:10:26,882 --> 01:10:27,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike Meekins

915
01:10:54,858 --> 01:10:56,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting that launch day for this game.

916
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:57,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta get it.

917
01:11:09,426 --> 01:11:10,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, Phoenix Wright 2, Justice for All.

918
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:13,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Megatop, tell us real quick, wait, before you go back, how does it work in Japan?

919
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:14,569
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the different games in Japan.

920
01:11:14,629 --> 01:11:16,771
[SPEAKER_11]: How many are out in Japan, and what's been translated over here?

921
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:25,015
[SPEAKER_03]: There's three on Game Boy Advance, and then they're making a new one on DS4, and it doesn't have Phoenix Wright in it anymore, at least that we know of so far.

922
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:27,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different attorney this time.

923
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:28,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

924
01:11:29,639 --> 01:11:36,965
[SPEAKER_03]: What's really cool is my coworker, she wasn't able to get the American one, but they just re-released the Japanese one in Japan.

925
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:40,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has a, well, of course they released it in Japan if it's Japanese.

926
01:11:40,848 --> 01:11:44,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can toggle between English or Japanese in the game.

927
01:11:44,571 --> 01:11:51,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can't find it in America right now, you can go on an import site and just get that re-release of the Japanese one.

928
01:11:51,937 --> 01:11:52,977
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still play it in English.

929
01:11:53,618 --> 01:11:53,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

930
01:11:54,318 --> 01:11:58,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Gravis Dolphin, any other thoughts there on Phoenix Riot or gaming in general?

931
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:03,216
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the worst game you ever played in your life?

932
01:12:03,896 --> 01:12:04,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you mine.

933
01:12:04,776 --> 01:12:06,516
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Deadly Towers for the Nest.

934
01:12:06,616 --> 01:12:07,817
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was horrible.

935
01:12:09,437 --> 01:12:12,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Worst game I've ever played in my life.

936
01:12:12,637 --> 01:12:13,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh.

937
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:26,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember Color Dreams, which was a company that played these games on the NES that were in those really colored cartridges?

938
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:26,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

939
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:32,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who The NES version of X-Men Oh my god!

940
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:32,905
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awful!

941
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:56,833
[SPEAKER_08]: or most people would say... The Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man.

942
01:12:57,293 --> 01:12:57,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

943
01:12:58,114 --> 01:12:58,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Or E.T.

944
01:12:59,775 --> 01:12:59,995
[SPEAKER_11]: E.T.

945
01:13:00,015 --> 01:13:00,675
[SPEAKER_08]: was worse.

946
01:13:00,735 --> 01:13:01,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Superman 64.

947
01:13:02,496 --> 01:13:09,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to be trendy here and kind of saying what everybody else says, but honestly, dude, Wand of Gamelon, Zelda...

948
01:13:11,045 --> 01:13:11,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

949
01:13:11,866 --> 01:13:12,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

950
01:13:31,952 --> 01:13:33,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Really that bad.

951
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:39,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure you can even download the movies on YouTube and that doesn't even begin just because the gameplay itself is horrible.

952
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:43,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what was Nintendo thinking letting these guys just poop on the Link franchise?

953
01:13:44,856 --> 01:13:46,316
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys literally shit on Link.

954
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:50,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now that you're our guinea pig, go play Big Rigs.

955
01:13:50,697 --> 01:13:51,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather not.

956
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:54,298
[SPEAKER_05]: They crapped on Mario 2?

957
01:13:55,118 --> 01:13:55,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario's Hotel?

958
01:13:55,878 --> 01:13:56,439
[SPEAKER_05]: That was horrible.

959
01:13:56,819 --> 01:13:57,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, yeah, yeah.

960
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:00,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ravenstaff and thanks for the question.

961
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:02,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's another game that I thought was pretty awful.

962
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:02,335
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

963
01:14:02,736 --> 01:14:03,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

964
01:14:05,215 --> 01:14:05,876
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate you.

965
01:14:06,336 --> 01:14:07,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't put it in worst game ever, though.

966
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:09,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worst game ever.

967
01:14:09,738 --> 01:14:13,160
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it shouldn't have carried the Final Fantasy name because it was way too much of a child's game.

968
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:13,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay.

969
01:14:14,461 --> 01:14:16,402
[SPEAKER_08]: It fit the niche that it was designed for, though.

970
01:14:16,422 --> 01:14:17,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It was an entry-level RPG.

971
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:18,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but you're right.

972
01:14:18,043 --> 01:14:18,903
[SPEAKER_11]: A, it shouldn't have been Final Fantasy.

973
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:20,384
[SPEAKER_11]: It shouldn't have been Final Fantasy.

974
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:23,186
[SPEAKER_11]: What I will give that game, though, is that it actually has a pretty kick-ass soundtrack.

975
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:23,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

976
01:14:23,866 --> 01:14:24,667
[SPEAKER_11]: All things considered.

977
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:31,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, whoever did it, I know it was a female that did the music there, and I think she came over to, I could be wrong, but I think she made some of the music in 11.

978
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:32,392
[SPEAKER_11]: I might be wrong.

979
01:14:32,432 --> 01:14:32,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't quote me on that.

980
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:35,420
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's got a great soundtrack, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

981
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:40,682
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, now that I think about it, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest would probably have fit in better had they called it a saga.

982
01:14:41,422 --> 01:14:43,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Romancing Saga, but Saga.

983
01:14:43,243 --> 01:14:44,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I think.

984
01:14:44,703 --> 01:14:46,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, honestly, it wasn't ever a Final Fantasy game.

985
01:14:46,764 --> 01:14:48,865
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great, because all the other Saga games are shit.

986
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:49,605
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not!

987
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:50,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate you, Ben!

988
01:14:50,985 --> 01:14:52,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like the Saga games at all.

989
01:14:52,486 --> 01:14:53,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Saga Frontier 2.

990
01:14:53,266 --> 01:14:53,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Saga 3.

991
01:14:53,506 --> 01:14:54,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like Saga at all.

992
01:14:54,727 --> 01:14:56,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Romancing Saga 2.

993
01:14:56,267 --> 01:14:57,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Romancing Saga 3, too.

994
01:14:57,068 --> 01:14:57,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

995
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:57,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

996
01:15:01,152 --> 01:15:01,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Raven's Dolphin, Ping Pals

997
01:15:21,921 --> 01:15:22,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was horrible.

998
01:15:22,722 --> 01:15:23,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought that.

999
01:15:23,703 --> 01:15:26,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought two copies.

1000
01:15:26,926 --> 01:15:30,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel sorry because I know somebody gave it to me as a gift, but it really is a bad game.

1001
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:33,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Play Burnout Legends on the DS.

1002
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:33,912
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll cry.

1003
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I've got to let you go, Ravensdoth.

1004
01:15:36,675 --> 01:15:37,676
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to keep moving on the show.

1005
01:15:37,836 --> 01:15:38,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1006
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: This is way too long.

1007
01:15:39,718 --> 01:15:40,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it, buddy.

1008
01:15:40,438 --> 01:15:40,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one.

1009
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:42,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he just hung up.

1010
01:15:43,281 --> 01:15:44,082
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate the call.

1011
01:15:45,369 --> 01:15:47,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?

1012
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:51,587
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the one and only Legend of Zaku Hi, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?

1013
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:59,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Coney Island just got Supernova last Friday, um, and it started to trickle, it started to trickle down on the east coast from what I'm hearing.

1014
01:15:59,991 --> 01:16:03,354
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are your impressions of DDR Supernova after playing it, which I imagine you have?

1015
01:16:03,374 --> 01:16:17,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, from one, from one, from one thing, I, we seem to, we seem to agree that it might be a beta cab because after comparing it to the one in Jersey Gardens, which I happened to play, which was a location test, it was a lot of differences in it.

1016
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:19,988
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, certain songs were coming in very early.

1017
01:16:21,031 --> 01:16:23,933
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in other words, there was early timing on songs such as You're Not Here.

1018
01:16:25,394 --> 01:16:28,276
[SPEAKER_06]: The pads, you know, were really stiff, obviously, because they're brand new.

1019
01:16:29,016 --> 01:16:37,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides that, you know, a lot of things that are just, you know, just the fact that, not really, I'm trying to think right now.

1020
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:40,223
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, we're not sure if this is it.

1021
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:45,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, it looks to me like it's the same build that I played before.

1022
01:16:46,046 --> 01:16:48,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Zaku, thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs middle?

1023
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:57,752
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so and so, I just hope Konami's playing the cards right, because if this is the final version, God help us all.

1024
01:16:58,212 --> 01:16:58,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1025
01:16:59,093 --> 01:17:00,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because of the early timings and stuff?

1026
01:17:01,175 --> 01:17:08,722
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just because of the fact that it's harder to get perfects now, it's harder to get double A's, because the timing window's really tight now.

1027
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:14,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought people were bitching that DDR was too easy, all the In The Groove fans were bitching it was too easy.

1028
01:17:15,026 --> 01:17:17,288
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I think they OD'd on the timing window.

1029
01:17:18,209 --> 01:17:21,412
[SPEAKER_06]: At first it started to be too loose, and now it's starting to be too tight.

1030
01:17:21,812 --> 01:17:23,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it should have been right there in the middle.

1031
01:17:25,255 --> 01:17:25,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

1032
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:33,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Besides that... What's been the general, because I imagine these arcades are packed, what's the general fan consensus that you're picking up?

1033
01:17:33,103 --> 01:17:35,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Are people happy to see a new DDR game back in arcades?

1034
01:17:36,504 --> 01:17:41,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are people bitching on these little... They're not bitching, so to say.

1035
01:17:41,746 --> 01:17:46,748
[SPEAKER_06]: They just really don't know what to believe, whether or not they are betas or real.

1036
01:17:47,428 --> 01:17:52,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way we're going to find that out is the second location in New York City when it's set up tomorrow, which is in Chinatown.

1037
01:17:53,157 --> 01:17:55,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll be eagerly awaiting a forum post letting us know.

1038
01:17:56,641 --> 01:17:58,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'm going to link you to one right now.

1039
01:17:59,584 --> 01:18:07,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to link you to a thread that actually shows the reaction from New Yorkers about the Supernova set up in Coney Island.

1040
01:18:07,973 --> 01:18:10,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's in our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1041
01:18:10,475 --> 01:18:11,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Click on chat.

1042
01:18:11,757 --> 01:18:14,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have time to read it right now because we're trying to do a show, but I'll check it out later.

1043
01:18:15,785 --> 01:18:23,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just keep in mind that Konami's just fooling around with the whole release date thing, so I really don't know what to believe right now.

1044
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:27,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know whether, as I said, I don't know whether these are betas, or is this the final thing.

1045
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up in the air right now.

1046
01:18:29,048 --> 01:18:31,228
[SPEAKER_11]: What else are people playing in New York City besides DDR?

1047
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:35,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stuff in the groove and stuff.

1048
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:38,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that all people do in New York, just dance?

1049
01:18:39,599 --> 01:18:41,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that all people do in New York is dance?

1050
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:49,062
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but they do other things like, you know, in Chinatown they play fighting games, but, you know, they have lives to live as well.

1051
01:18:49,382 --> 01:18:50,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something we do on the side.

1052
01:18:50,923 --> 01:18:52,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Zaka, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.

1053
01:18:52,943 --> 01:18:53,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much for the call.

1054
01:18:54,364 --> 01:18:54,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1055
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:55,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

1056
01:18:55,204 --> 01:18:55,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1057
01:18:55,704 --> 01:18:55,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1058
01:18:56,805 --> 01:18:58,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I gotta let this call through.

1059
01:18:58,485 --> 01:18:59,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1060
01:18:59,726 --> 01:19:00,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

1061
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:01,586
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Bandit.

1062
01:19:01,746 --> 01:19:02,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Bandit.

1063
01:19:02,547 --> 01:19:06,268
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you won points earlier, so I decided to take one more call because I saw it was you.

1064
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:06,888
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

1065
01:19:07,605 --> 01:19:08,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, yeah, I appreciate that.

1066
01:19:08,846 --> 01:19:10,106
[SPEAKER_04]: He wasn't giving me points anyways.

1067
01:19:10,707 --> 01:19:10,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerk.

1068
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:11,407
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1069
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:11,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take him.

1070
01:19:11,987 --> 01:19:12,768
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his we.

1071
01:19:13,288 --> 01:19:14,609
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1072
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:15,930
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1073
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:17,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just on the last call.

1074
01:19:18,191 --> 01:19:19,612
[SPEAKER_04]: He was complaining about the timing window.

1075
01:19:20,892 --> 01:19:26,175
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing they did differently is they just made the marvelous timing the perfect timing now.

1076
01:19:27,536 --> 01:19:29,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposedly from the post I've been reading.

1077
01:19:30,218 --> 01:19:30,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1078
01:19:30,538 --> 01:19:31,518
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all they did.

1079
01:19:31,838 --> 01:19:32,579
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean...

1080
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:35,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Bandit, I asked Zaku this, and I'll ask you this.

1081
01:19:35,977 --> 01:19:55,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Weren't most DDR players that went over to In The Groove or whatever claiming, and honestly, guys, just play both and enjoy both, but weren't people that went over to In The Groove kind of complaining that the difficulty was too easy on DDR, which is kind of why they wanted a harder game like In The Groove, and now that Konami's went and made the game harder, they're upset?

1082
01:19:56,035 --> 01:19:58,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've argued with so many people about this.

1083
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:03,778
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people went to ITG just because they thought there weren't going to be a new DDR coming out.

1084
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:08,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they complain about the difficulty in DDR, or not being hard enough.

1085
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:15,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not because of the grading, it's because of the actual step charts of the song that I keep getting people complaining to me about.

1086
01:20:15,263 --> 01:20:21,326
[SPEAKER_04]: They're always like, oh, this step chart's not hard enough, or this isn't like this and that, on in the groove, and they keep comparing it back and forth.

1087
01:20:22,286 --> 01:20:25,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they got to remember, there wouldn't be any ITG without DDR first.

1088
01:20:28,478 --> 01:20:28,938
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1089
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:33,381
[SPEAKER_04]: There are harder step charts in DDR now.

1090
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:36,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're AAAing everything, I don't want to hear any complaints.

1091
01:20:36,922 --> 01:20:38,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to hear any of this stuff again.

1092
01:20:42,185 --> 01:20:44,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you live in an area where Supernova is on its way, or what?

1093
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in Pittsburgh.

1094
01:20:47,508 --> 01:20:48,248
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get one yet.

1095
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:50,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on its way, though.

1096
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:51,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1097
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:56,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Bandit, thanks so much for calling in and giving your perspective on Supernova.

1098
01:20:56,252 --> 01:20:56,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

1099
01:20:57,338 --> 01:20:58,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright man, thanks for the points.

1100
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:00,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no problem.

1101
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:15,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting razzed for that in the chat room now because apparently I've ruffled the panties of DMN and he's a little upset now because I was arguing with him whether you should have points or not and I should just keep my big fat opinion out of it and let him run his contest.

1102
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Just keep on leeching points for me, you bastard.

1103
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:20,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Bandit, have a good one.

1104
01:21:20,788 --> 01:21:21,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you guys do the same.

1105
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:22,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, bye.

1106
01:21:23,499 --> 01:21:26,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I realize DMN does not have to be doing a contest.

1107
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I am very grateful.

1108
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:28,660
[SPEAKER_11]: He already knows that.

1109
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:32,902
[SPEAKER_11]: But I still have to give him shit because that's what I do on this program is I give our chatters shit.

1110
01:21:33,282 --> 01:21:35,662
[SPEAKER_11]: But know that I do that because I love you very much.

1111
01:21:36,943 --> 01:21:38,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Last minute stories, boys and girls.

1112
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:40,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything final you guys want to bring up?

1113
01:21:40,884 --> 01:21:41,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I do.

1114
01:21:42,744 --> 01:21:45,625
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends on LiveJournal linked this story on Kotaku.

1115
01:21:47,997 --> 01:22:05,830
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a contest going on through July where if you buy a copy of Tetris during that time period and register the serial at Club Nintendo, you can choose to battle Utada Hikaru or get concert tickets.

1116
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:12,715
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 people will be chosen to play against her and 504 pairs of tickets will be given out.

1117
01:22:13,992 --> 01:22:20,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now the thing is, though, is that there's a video of her playing, and it's actually up on YouTube.

1118
01:22:21,497 --> 01:22:22,978
[SPEAKER_01]: She completely owns this guy.

1119
01:22:23,799 --> 01:22:26,840
[SPEAKER_01]: She plays really, really well.

1120
01:22:28,121 --> 01:22:38,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can either see the movie file up on Kotaku, or you can check it out, do a search on YouTube, but, yeah, she's really good at Tetris.

1121
01:22:39,068 --> 01:22:41,190
[SPEAKER_11]: DMN is putting out a challenge right there.

1122
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,971
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, I'll fuck up Utada.

1123
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a Tetris DS challenge in the making right there.

1124
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:49,023
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on.

1125
01:22:49,103 --> 01:22:50,304
[SPEAKER_11]: The gauntlet's been thrown down.

1126
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:51,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Utada, if you're listening.

1127
01:22:51,965 --> 01:23:03,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to play her because actually the thing I noticed, she plays Tetris the same way I do, which is build up for the four line and it keeps hopping up.

1128
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:09,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Even them out to where you have the full four lines down the next one.

1129
01:23:09,638 --> 01:23:11,419
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly how I play Tetris.

1130
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:13,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be very fun, I think.

1131
01:23:14,758 --> 01:23:15,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that's a girl gamer.

1132
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:17,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Well done.

1133
01:23:18,481 --> 01:23:19,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything last minute?

1134
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:19,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else?

1135
01:23:20,142 --> 01:23:22,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was something interesting I should point out.

1136
01:23:23,505 --> 01:23:36,436
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pointed out that 99 Nights, one of the things that happens to be on Microsoft's site, I believe, is showing the product info for 99 Nights.

1137
01:23:37,357 --> 01:23:40,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's interesting because it says hard drive required.

1138
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,802
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that I thought Microsoft was not going to do

1139
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:46,478
[SPEAKER_09]: with their games is require you to have a hard drive.

1140
01:23:46,618 --> 01:23:49,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And such an anticipated game, too.

1141
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:49,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

1142
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:56,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of those out there that don't have a hard drive, you're kind of fucked.

1143
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:02,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless this pans out to be just a mistake or something, but that's pretty... Well, they had that one, was it Football Manager or something like that?

1144
01:24:02,822 --> 01:24:03,942
[SPEAKER_09]: They required the hard drive.

1145
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:05,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking this is the way they're going.

1146
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:09,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Why they're releasing the 256 megabyte card then is beyond me.

1147
01:24:09,283 --> 01:24:12,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Just lower the price of the hard drive or release a larger hard drive.

1148
01:24:13,191 --> 01:24:17,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but it has hard drive required and hard drive enhanced is two of the things on there.

1149
01:24:18,435 --> 01:24:20,176
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I thought that was interesting.

1150
01:24:22,678 --> 01:24:23,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1151
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1152
01:24:25,821 --> 01:24:27,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else last minute, you guys?

1153
01:24:30,424 --> 01:24:30,545
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1154
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:33,067
[SPEAKER_09]: There was another thing also I had.

1155
01:24:33,127 --> 01:24:36,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Genesis Collection is coming to PlayStation 2 and the PSP.

1156
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:40,672
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to have a collection of old Genesis games, 28 of them, and

1157
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:56,193
[SPEAKER_09]: with the additional three being unlocked, including Shinobi 2, Sonic the Hedgehog, Golden Axe 1, 2, and 3, Virtual Fighter 2, Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, and Phantasy Star.

1158
01:24:57,153 --> 01:24:58,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Rise from your grave.

1159
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:04,054
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, then I guess that's going to do it for tonight's show.

1160
01:25:04,614 --> 01:25:08,395
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just about wrapped up here, but we want to go around first and get everybody's final thought.

1161
01:25:08,435 --> 01:25:09,255
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a long time.

1162
01:25:09,531 --> 01:25:10,292
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1163
01:25:33,493 --> 01:25:38,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for your support of Orange Entree over the years and glad to see you're local and can drop by once in a while.

1164
01:25:39,856 --> 01:25:40,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Final thought?

1165
01:25:40,957 --> 01:25:42,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I got sex appeal because I dual wield.

1166
01:25:43,998 --> 01:25:44,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Nerd.

1167
01:25:44,499 --> 01:25:45,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought?

1168
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:49,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play this game Senko no Ronde for the 360.

1169
01:25:50,222 --> 01:25:51,122
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Einhander.

1170
01:25:52,123 --> 01:25:55,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And my final thought is Head Hurts must run Ice Cube.

1171
01:25:55,965 --> 01:25:58,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Ice Cube shampoo would be great right now for my sunburned head.

1172
01:25:59,006 --> 01:26:02,648
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you guys listening to my FU in Part A. Dark Sakura, your final thought?

1173
01:26:03,118 --> 01:26:05,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Reject false icons and give me a taco.

1174
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:06,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a great week.

1175
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,040
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next time.

1176
01:26:35,894 --> 01:26:38,336
