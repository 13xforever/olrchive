Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Anyway, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 188 for this June the 25th of 2006.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,440
We're here, we're going to get back into the news very shortly here, however, I wanted

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,080
to grill our special guest in studio, 23rd Magus, here for just a minute here about something

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,360
he had told me about on break.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,440
You were talking about World of Warcraft, right?

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Yes.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,560
And you were talking about the add-ons for World of Warcraft.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Yes.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,820
Now, there was one that I thought was very interesting that you said you had installed

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,800
that messes with the chat somehow?

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
I've never heard of this, this sounds great.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,840
Yes, it's an add-on called Eloquence.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,380
It's a chat filter, I refer to it as a sanity filter, for the grammar freaks out there who

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:07,380
are tired of the noob speak, the dude speak, the lead speak, or just plain dumb speak.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,140
Basically it filters through whatever comes through your chat and parses it so it's all

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,300
capitalized and punctuated and it translates the abbreviations for you. For the roleplay

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:29,920
it'll even apply basic roleplay things to it, or even apply a dialect, and there's similar

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,540
chat add-ons out there, I mentioned my FUs about the LFG channel, there's a filter out

22
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,700
there that will filter out anything that's not related to looking for group comments.

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:51,540
And most of the add-ons for the WoW players you can go to ui.worldofwar.net or curse-gaming.com

24
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,440
and pick up some add-ons to kind of enhance your play experience.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,260
So this filter basically forces noobs, in other words by the time it reaches your computer

26
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,340
screen, to be using correct spelling and punctuation.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,320
Yes, it makes people sound smarter than they are.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,540
Whoever wrote this should win a humanitarian award, seriously.

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,220
I should nominate him for one.

30
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,740
I think we should nominate this person for a Nobel Peace Prize.

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,340
Don't you think we ought to install something like this, DarkSakura?

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
God.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,340
That's great.

34
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,140
Except for the times where you do it as a joke when it's funny.

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Still, I love good grammar, and I like to see good grammar when I'm about in my MMOs.

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,500
Maybe something like that for Ragnarok.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Beautiful thought.

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Eel, please.

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,360
I just wanted you to be able to share that with our listeners because I bet I didn't know about that

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
But I'm only a casual World of Warcraft player. I'm not you know hardcore casuals casual Rob

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Yeah, yeah, or what are you trying to say? I'm just in other words. I casual casual who has never even hit 60

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,240
No, I haven't, but that's you know. I don't I don't play to hit 60. I play for fun

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,520
I had 60 someday, but you'll have more. I don't profess to be some World of Warcraft expert. Okay. I've got zillions of other games

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,120
I'm trying to play too all right anyway moving on

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,680
Some news out of Nintendo this week some power players over at Nintendo namely Iwata and Miyamoto have been discussing the Wii the

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,600
Nintendo DS and more and there's a full in-depth article over on gamasutra.com

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,480
I thought maybe I'd pull some choice quotes out of here

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,960
Iwata talked about the GameCube launch when we launched GameCube the initial sales were good and all the hardware was

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,640
manufactured at the time we were sold through.

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:45,800
However, at this period, we could not provide the market with strong software titles in

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
a timely fashion.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,840
As a result, we could not leverage the initial launch time momentum, and sales of GameCube

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
slowed down.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,200
To avoid repeating this with Wii, we have been intensifying the software development,

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,140
both internally at Nintendo and at developers outside the company, in order to prepare aggressive

56
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,260
software lineup for Wii and after the launch.

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,300
So it kind of sounds like they're learning from some of the mistakes they made with the

58
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,260
GameCube, which was namely kind of a dead period, which kind of happened with the DS

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
too, didn't it?

60
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,740
But I remember for a couple months after the DS came out, even on this show, because we

61
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,380
were up and running by the time the DS was out, and I remember earlier episodes of this

62
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,140
program during that lull, we were kind of like, come on Nintendo, where's our games?

63
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,420
Ping Pals ain't gonna cut it, come on!

64
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,700
And suddenly, boom!

65
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Hit games.

66
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,560
like just one hit game after another.

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,720
Miyamoto, I'm sure you guys want to know what he said.

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Here's a quote from Miyamoto.

69
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,160
While I feel that we need more internal software development resources at Nintendo, we have

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
not increased the number greatly.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,100
When we combine the total number of people working for Nintendo's first party and second

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,680
party titles, however, there are far more than 1,500 people working on the titles today.

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,720
Very interesting, some quotes there from the main men themselves that they're trying to

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,560
learn from their mistakes with the GameCube and go forth with that so

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,140
I applaud folks that can look at that in perspective and say okay what can we do

76
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,280
better next time

77
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,360
definitely and in fact things that

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,040
you know you can do better next time or actually

79
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Jamie you had something? I was just saying it's good business sense. That's what any business

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,600
needs to

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
to progress is learn from their mistakes. Yeah and you can't just assume that the

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
business is going to be there no matter what and I will

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,040
I will not name any companies here who seem to be guilty of making that mistake recently,

84
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,840
but it's four letters, starts with an S, ends with Oni.

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Speaking of progressive thinking, the brand new Macbook, basically running off of some

86
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,960
really crappy integrated graphics chip that is unable to run most games, well, fear not,

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,000
at least you can use it sort of like the Wii.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,280
the accelerometer that's built into it that's basically designed to detect that the computer's

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:10,500
falling and stop the hard drive so that it doesn't ruin any of your data. Well, a clever

90
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:19,520
gamer has actually used this program called the AMS2HID, which is used with this program

91
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,520
a Neverball, to basically make the modern day equivalent of a wooden labyrinth. So,

92
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,620
by tilting your computer you can use it to control games. Crappy games, yes, but you

93
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,240
can control games. I knew you would not be able to get through that story without taking

94
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,220
a swing. I'm sorry, it can't run anything! It says right in the article here, it's using

95
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,180
this basically this integrated you know graphics chip that's designed by Apple

96
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,740
and it doesn't run anything because it's not you know ATI or Nvidia compliance so

97
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,460
I'm sorry it's the way it is so you don't buy it for games big deal but if

98
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,620
you do you know you can play at least this game by tilting the computer which

99
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,620
I'm sure is gonna be oh so comfortable they are really light yeah at least it's

100
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,780
It's an Apple, those are light computers compared to some of these monsters, other ones I've

101
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,780
used.

102
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,780
ATI chip in this one.

103
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,580
Yeah, look, I do think it's a silly idea, but you know, whatever, some guy's bored and

104
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:30,800
wants to do Labyrinth, whatever, but I don't really see it being the next trend in gaming.

105
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,700
This is more one of those, you know, isn't that funny stories to me.

106
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,540
I don't know, I mean if you, it's just like was it like that stupid game that they had

107
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:53,540
with Windows 98, that like bumper car game thing that came with, yeah that sucked too.

108
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:01,020
None of the games made by like Microsoft or Apple that come with their systems, granted

109
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,140
they're not supposed to be that great, just they all suck.

110
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,300
I mean, you can't really innovate on solitaire.

111
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't know.

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,740
Kiss my ass, Chip's challenged with the shit.

113
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,860
Didn't come with it, you had to buy it separately.

114
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,120
Alright, anyway.

115
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,540
We were talking about Wii-type technology there a little bit.

116
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,620
But what is really coming to the Wii? Perhaps some new trademarks registered

117
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,940
by Nintendo of Japan give some hints.

118
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,360
Wii Culture was something that was recently trademarked by them.

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,320
Wii pointer which kinda sounds like it might be the name of the

120
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,720
what we've been calling the Wii mode or the rev mode or was that what you were calling it?

121
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,680
What were you calling it DarkSocker? I've always been calling it the Wii Mote.

122
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,600
The Wii Con. You were calling it the Wii Con.

123
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,480
Well it sounds like the official name is probably going to be the Wii Pointer because I don't know what else

124
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,360
that could be. Also they've registered

125
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,840
exclamation point exclamation point M

126
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,720
and you can actually look that up online if you want to see that trademark for

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,320
yourself it seems like exclamation exclamation M could be some type of

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,080
instant messaging because that kind of looks like I am when you look at it

129
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,280
however we don't know you know anything 100% for sure until the system actually

130
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,840
comes out so we shall see but we like to speculate based on what's going on

131
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,680
behind the instant messenger do you know is it was that announced for sure oh I'm

132
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,680
making that up. Nintendo Media 64 is pointing out that it's Wii upside down. Yeah, we figured

133
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,140
that one out. Yeah, and that's a cutesy thing to do, which would make sense for Nintendo,

134
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,140
but we'll find out. Yeah. Well, I don't know, it could be instant messaging, but who knows.

135
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,580
instant messaging, but who knows. One thing though that Nintendo does have in store at

136
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,320
least is the fact that their controller actually vibrates and it is wireless so that's one

137
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,320
step ahead of Sony, but of course immersion says that they're wondering now if Nintendo

138
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,680
copied them and that there could possibly be a lawsuit against Nintendo. We know for

139
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,040
For a fact, you know, of course Microsoft actually licenses the immersion technology

140
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,480
or whatever. I don't know, I can't believe that they're the first company to think of

141
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,140
rumbling controllers. But, I don't know, they're basically going to keep a close eye on the

142
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,400
Wii to see if the technology is the same and if they can make some money off of it.

143
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,200
So what is it? We've got our eye on you. We've got our eye on you! We're the only one that

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,180
could get to work so obviously you copied us I mean that's basically what

145
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,260
it's you know backwards thinking I'm starting to wonder about these guys it's

146
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,500
kind of interesting I don't like I don't like them and what was they have why

147
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,000
just because of this I just don't like immersion I don't know why you know you

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,300
got to tell me why why don't I like them because they're basically trying to

149
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,980
profit off of all this stuff granted you know they're trying to you know sue for

150
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,300
why didn't they sue them back in the day when they have the rumble pack or

151
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,280
or something like that. Why didn't they sue back when, you know, the original PlayStation

152
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,680
came out originally? Why sue now is my question.

153
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,200
Well, I don't know. It just seems kind of funny because it seems like when we talked

154
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
about this with Sony, it was funny. But now that's going on with Nintendo, it's like,

155
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
oh no, you didn't.

156
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,560
No, it's still funny. And I still think it's funny, you know, because, you know, I'm sure

157
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,400
that they're going to try to do a lawsuit for it. But here's my thing. It would be like

158
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,840
If I came up with the technology for LCD screens and now I go back and say, I'm gonna sue all

159
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
you people!

160
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,680
I mean that's basically what it is, isn't it a little late to be doing that?

161
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,720
I don't know, that's what it seems like to me.

162
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,520
It's like, well if you're so concerned about your technology and your patents, why weren't

163
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,720
you trying to protect them for the last few years?

164
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,760
What's wrong with that?

165
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,880
Don't tell me you didn't realize that Sony had controllers that rumbled because that's

166
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
ridiculous.

167
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,080
Holy Mania has an interesting perspective on this in our chat room.

168
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,040
When capitalism no longer works, you sue.

169
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Interesting perspective.

170
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
Yeah.

171
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:27,760
Excuse me, I had a something caught in my throat.

172
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Hairball?

173
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Yeah, hairball.

174
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,760
You know, with as much hair as I managed to brush off the cat last night, I wouldn't be surprised.

175
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Anyway, um, well, you know how Sony was saying, you know, the, uh, PS3 is a computer, the PS3 is a computer, blah blah blah, they were saying about the PS2?

176
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Yeah, you brought this up a couple weeks ago, yeah, about the computer thing with the PS3.

177
00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Well, basically, the UK Court of Appeals has said that the PlayStation 2 is not a computer.

178
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
They basically pretty much laughed at Sony.

179
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Lord Justice C. Chadwick said that Sony's skeleton argument was, to quote,

180
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:22,800
to quote beyond what can be regarded as acceptable written advocacy so Sony got

181
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,480
uh got pwned they got served interesting so what does this mean those tax breaks

182
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,560
that we're looking forward to may not happen yep pretty much the UK Court of

183
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,720
Appeals also denied Sony any right to bring the case to the European Court of

184
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,600
Justice the other thing that should note is it doesn't matter anyways if the ps3

185
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:51,160
3 is considered a computer and not because those taxes on electronics are gone now. So,

186
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:58,440
it wouldn't matter if it's, you know, categorized as a game console, as a PC, as a vibrator,

187
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,640
it doesn't matter. It's still going to be tax free. So, I don't know. I think any way

188
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,340
to make more money it seems like nowadays it's just I don't know very desperate very

189
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:23,460
crazy crazy like Kojima and his comparisons to steak yes what may I be talking about well

190
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:31,520
actually Kojima was comparing the consoles to a steak dinner and like DVDs so I don't

191
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,800
know that's kind of a strange comparison when you think about it but I thought it was funny

192
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
So I'm going to read them for you.

193
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
So for example, PlayStation 3.

194
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,800
If the game creators and users want to have a great steak for their anniversary,

195
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
they maybe go to the PS3.

196
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,800
And then of course for the 360, if they want a great steak dinner,

197
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,800
a great steak with their family, a little bit more casual during the weekends,

198
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
they might select the 360.

199
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I don't understand how these comparisons of steak work, but whatever.

200
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,640
whatever and then of course then to the we why not have a great stake at your

201
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,240
house every day and then

202
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,600
might shoes the we does that make any sense to you

203
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,480
because it is making sense to me I you know usually see a centric people that

204
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,680
are making these comparisons to a

205
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,960
the food and other things that I don't know it's a very strange to pay me make

206
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,520
yes when he was talking about movies

207
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,240
PlayStation 3 is like a movie theater for people who want to see this movie

208
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,540
on a big screen with THX and 5.1 audio

209
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,640
even if they have to pay a high price. Whereas the 360

210
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,860
the 360 is like a DVD. Basically you don't know

211
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,300
what movie you want to see so you go to the store and see if you can pick up a

212
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,060
good one.

213
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,500
Which I don't understand. And then the Wii

214
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,580
is like a TV for when you're home. You don't know

215
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,500
what you want to watch but you want to have that variety.

216
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:10,580
Well, one of the best people I got to meet at E3, Igarashi Koji, has actually made some

217
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:17,700
comments about the PlayStation 3 at E3, and he's quoted as saying, maybe it's too expensive.

218
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,360
But he did actually have an interview with Game Informer talking about Microsoft and

219
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,520
said he wasn't really negative about Microsoft, but to quote, for some reason they tend to

220
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,740
back off a little when it comes to something really foreign, but if Japanese developers

221
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,400
would say they're working on Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest or Metal Gear maybe, then

222
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,720
I guess Japanese consumers would take it seriously and consider purchasing it.

223
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:50,120
He's also stated that as far as the new Castlevania games going for Portrait of Ruin, the next

224
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,720
installment after Dawn of Sorrow would it might feature unlockable co-op

225
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,740
missions to be played over Wi-Fi but that's not confirmed actually he's

226
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,360
quoted as saying it's not confirmed because he hasn't started working on it

227
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,320
so he's thinking that it would be something unlockable it was also

228
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:18,640
mentioned that that basically there's going to be the two screen display for

229
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,800
portrait of ruin again for the for the DS different closeable items in there

230
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,960
but it's not stated whether or not it's going to be skills and items rather than

231
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:39,320
souls so sad to say but there was the potential about possibly working on the

232
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,000
PlayStation 3 in the Xbox 360 also come up in that interview I'm sure many

233
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,520
folks would be very much looking forward to a Castlevania on the PlayStation 3

234
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,480
I just love his reaction.

235
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,320
Yeah.

236
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,080
Perhaps it's a bit too expensive.

237
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,540
Anyway, another game that people are really looking forward to

238
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,360
is Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

239
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,160
And there's a new rumor floating around.

240
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,660
It started at gonintendo.com that Ubisoft

241
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,800
is going to be getting into the game there

242
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
with some of their characters.

243
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,620
And if you think about what that would bring to the table,

244
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,280
that could be Jade from Beyond Good and Evil, Rayman,

245
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,560
Sam Fisher, which would be an interesting counterpart

246
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,160
to Solid Snake if you think about it,

247
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:25,660
And the Prince, from Prince of Persia, which I think, probably from that list, Rayman and the Prince would seem most likely, especially Rayman, that would be an interesting addition, yeah, I could see that.

248
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:40,660
So that was developer Mashihiro Sakurai saying that other third-party characters would be a definite possibility, and GoNintendo.com, I suppose, is speculating that Ubisoft is possibly the other third-party being involved there.

249
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,860
You know what would be cool though if they did it, since they're releasing Rave Man's

250
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,860
Raving Rabbits, have the rabbits as one of the characters.

251
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,340
You just want to kill bunnies.

252
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,260
I just, I think they're funny.

253
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
That's what it is.

254
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,260
You just want to murder bunnies.

255
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
I know how you are.

256
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Cute animals need to die.

257
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Alright.

258
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,020
And of course, you know, every time we bring up Super Smash Bros. Brawl, folks in the chat

259
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,980
room start talking about what characters they want to see in it.

260
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,060
Yuri Lever talking about Katamari.

261
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,820
That would be an interesting third party thing.

262
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,020
Well, the only thing about that is they've said they haven't been on the system already,

263
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,220
so probably not.

264
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,260
Poo Eater says the Jet Set guy he could spray your face, but again, also not on any Nintendo

265
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
system.

266
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
I still say Sonic.

267
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,900
I think Sonic and Bonk are actually the ones I'm thinking.

268
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,540
Oh, that's a good point, especially with the recent Genesis and TurboGrafx love, thanks

269
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
to the Virtual Console.

270
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
That's a brilliant idea.

271
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
I hope it happens.

272
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,540
Anyway, DarkSakura.

273
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,540
We get letters once in a while, right?

274
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Oh, really?

275
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
Yes, they send them to mailbag at orangelandradio.com.

276
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
Real quick last thought, sorry.

277
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
Nestor and Howard.

278
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
Stop it.

279
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
That's a little too old school for most people, I think.

280
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,540
All right, anyway.

281
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Dude, I remember Nestor and Howard.

282
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
I do too.

283
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Especially the Mega Man one that went on for like three issues.

284
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,540
That one was great.

285
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Do we ever get emails about Nestor and Howard?

286
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
No.

287
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
We should.

288
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,500
us their favorite memories well dark soccer tell us about what they're

289
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:20,020
emailing us about at mailbag at orange launcher calm this week our listeners

290
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,980
are very emo okay I'm gonna start from the beginning I got one from DJ ratchet

291
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,540
who's been on our boards for quite a while just to go ahead and read this I've

292
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,140
been behind on your podcast I've been listening to a few of the slightly older

293
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,140
I have a few responses to some of the things said.

294
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,140
Number one, congrats on Loki for getting married even though everyone said it a hundred times.

295
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,140
It's not just OLR with the Sony hate, pretty much every other podcast I've listened to has nothing but bad things to say about Sony.

296
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,140
At least you guys are trying to be fair, others are being real fanboyish about the whole thing.

297
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,140
I'm one of the suckers who are going to get a PS3 though.

298
00:20:54,140 --> 00:21:00,140
I'm trying guys, I'm really trying to be devil's advocate when it comes to Sony, but guys it's tough.

299
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,620
And even the Sony fanboys have to recognize right now the odds are not in your favor. I'm sorry

300
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:10,520
The system is only as good as the games on it. E3 was not a good setup for Sony fanboys. I'm sorry

301
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,260
We'll do what we can the rest of the year

302
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,700
Maybe Sony will throw us a few frickin bones before Christmas, but or the launch of the system really, but they had cool commercials though

303
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:25,060
Yeah, I guess there's something today. They will if they get Castlevania. That's a huge plus to return to the email

304
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Harmonics does need to make another amplitude frequency game. I'm still hooked to those games.

305
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:35,060
Guitar Hero looks like amplitude with a guitar peripheral and nothing else. That's the reason I have not bought Guitar Hero.

306
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Quick question. Is Space Channel 5 Special Edition for the PS2 a straight port of the Dreamcast version? I'm considering buying it.

307
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:48,060
To answer the question, actually it's both. It's Space Channel 5 2 and the Dreamcast one.

308
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,060
I own it. I have not played it yet because I have the Japanese Space Channel 5 2.

309
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,500
but I do know that it's supposed to include both games. I've played it.

310
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,980
I've played the Japanese version actually, randomly enough, and

311
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,740
it is pretty much a direct port, but if you have not played Space Channel 5,

312
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,920
you must have this game. Especially if you're a music game fan, which I'm

313
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,360
guessing if you have DJ in your nickname, you probably are,

314
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,600
you really want to pick up this game. And also DJ Ratchet, thank you for the well

315
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,060
wish.

316
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,040
Actually, another thing that he wanted to add is that his mother, who knows

317
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,280
there's nothing about video games thinks that the Blu-ray is the biggest rip-off in the world.

318
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,920
Well the players are like, I don't know,

319
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,520
$700 or something right? Oh that was something I saw this week is I saw an HD DVD

320
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,400
player in action at like Best Buy or something and

321
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,200
you know what? Not ready to drop a thousand dollars on it that's for sure

322
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,760
or whatever they're trying to do. $600?

323
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,120
I don't know. Honestly, $360 if they're gonna release that they're gonna have to do it

324
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,840
like $200 at most for that player for me to be interested in it because the

325
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,560
picture quality is not that much better and if blu-ray is only supposed to look

326
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,880
that good I am not impressed with the technology you know at this time I just

327
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,080
don't think there's gonna be it's not that huge of improvement over existing

328
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,960
DVDs on on my HD I don't know it's just me we have another email from Mark from

329
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,520
Australia who is actually is one of the it's a very interesting email go ahead

330
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,980
and I read this out loud, I've just finished listening to episode 187 and once again I

331
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,400
hear you guys defending violent content in video games.

332
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,040
It seems to be a topic that is forever raising its ugly head in almost every single show.

333
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,720
Now although I'm a gamer and particularly love violent content in the games I play,

334
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,800
I find your arguments always seem to be one sided.

335
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,280
I've never heard anyone from Orange Lawns Radio seriously and intelligently consider

336
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,800
whether it's bad for kids or more so if it's bad for adults.

337
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,720
can simulated killing really be good for your head?

338
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,040
Loki asks the question, what's worse, simulated killing or killing a deer?

339
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,160
I'm sure Loki has no idea about the answer to this question but proceeds to speak in

340
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,480
a high pitched voice mimicking the mothers of the affected kids, his only objective is

341
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,860
to try to offend them.

342
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:07,240
If he calmed down and put some thought into his answers he might seem credible.

343
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,320
I actually responded to him and in my email I said that the viewpoint we've been coming

344
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,160
from is more on the rebuttal standpoint where we're given a limited scope of

345
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,920
what to defend basically we have all these people and I honestly think the

346
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,560
ones that are saying you know ban it ban it ban it are very one-sided very you

347
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,080
know not willing to put a lot of thought into it no I fully agree and I've

348
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,280
actually said this in the past I said it today you know there is a certain age

349
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,480
where you have to be careful with what you expose your children to, but any, I

350
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,680
should say, mature adult, any person who's above a certain age and has a certain

351
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,600
ability to tell reality from, you know, fantasy, would be able to intelligently

352
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,480
know the difference between picking up your controller and killing a bunch of

353
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
of pixels or 3D rendered models,

354
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,080
then taking an Uzi and blowing away your school.

355
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,120
I think that an intelligent, sane human being

356
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,080
would be able to tell the difference.

357
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,480
I, yeah, I absolutely agree with that,

358
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,280
and I think, you know, the listener who wrote us an email

359
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,920
said something about how we never say that kids,

360
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,820
or the games aren't harmful to kids.

361
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,040
Games, video games are harmful to some kids,

362
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,480
kids who don't know any better. And for me, though, that's really up to a parent to make

363
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,000
that determination. Is a game going to be harmful to the child or not? Is the child

364
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,400
going to be mature enough to play this game that I'm going to buy for them with my money?

365
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,120
And certainly there are some games that some children should not be playing, but that's

366
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,680
really up to the parent to make the decision there. And that's kind of just my thoughts

367
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,440
on it.

368
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,000
Loki, do you have anything you want to say about the mom impressions or whatever?

369
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,120
not knowing what I'm talking about or something?

370
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Yeah.

371
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:12,640
Well, okay, I may not have killed a deer or, you know, an animal of that sort or whatever,

372
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,560
but I mean you can definitely argue that killing something that doesn't exist except in a virtual

373
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,960
world is probably gonna be less violent than going out and actually killing something that's

374
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
alive.

375
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,280
I mean, that's pretty- any idiot can tell you that.

376
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,440
I mean, if I kill, you know, a virtual hooker I guess, it's not a real person, they don't

377
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,880
have feelings, their family's not going to worry about, you know, they're not going to

378
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,160
be all upset if I kill her, she just responds later and I go kill her again, it doesn't

379
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
matter.

380
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,600
Whereas, you know, if I go kill, you know, my next door neighbor, that's a little different.

381
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,540
More people are impacted by that.

382
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,800
So how can you say that I'm wrong in saying that killing a virtual person is nowhere near

383
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,600
to the effect of killing, you know, something real. Even if it's not a human person, say

384
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,920
you kill, you know, an animal or something, you know, kids are, you know, brought up knowing

385
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,360
that animals are cute and stuff, and if you take them out into the wilderness without

386
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,280
obviously educating them and stuff, and you go and blow away Bambi, I mean, that's going

387
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,960
to be a little, you know, that's going to probably shock them more than saying killing

388
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,200
virtual, you know, prostitute Betty, I don't know.

389
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,200
also you speaking of that you know what's worse going out and killing a

390
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,880
deer for the sport of it or killing a deer because you're hungry and you need

391
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,160
food you know that there's I think everything is situational okay or what

392
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,200
about see someone has broken into your house and has a gun at your head I'm

393
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,800
going to shoot them okay I don't care I will do what it takes to defend my house

394
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,960
if they are in my property and they're threatening to kill me hell yeah I would

395
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
strike out at them.

396
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,600
It seems to be going a little into the what-ifs.

397
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,080
When you're looking at these types of situations, when you're going out for the purpose of killing

398
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,640
somebody for sport, that's when you need to look at your level of sanity.

399
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,720
When you've got something for defense or you're hunting something for your survival, that's

400
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,560
not even something that should be comparable.

401
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:24,900
I think that even comparing, you know, virtual violence, you can't compare that to reality.

402
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,320
There's no basis.

403
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,640
And yeah, the games are not meant for kids, and to be honest, they shouldn't be playing

404
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
them.

405
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,640
That's why we have ratings on the back of them.

406
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,320
If you give it to your kid, then obviously you think that he is ready, or he or she is

407
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,200
ready to see what is in the game.

408
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,680
And the same goes with R-rated movies.

409
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,960
Firebomber was pointing out that I'm at Ted Nugent's level.

410
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,120
He's a survivalist though, Ted Nugent's cool.

411
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,080
I think it was interesting the deer hunting thing that got brought up, because then Pooeater

412
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,400
in our chat room says, I killed deers in Deer Hunter 3, which makes me think that's a game

413
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,720
that you see in the lobby of every Walmart across the nation, which is just kind of an

414
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
interesting observation.

415
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
I strangely found one in an Irish pub.

416
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,140
Anyway, thanks for the email, I mean, you know, we like thought-provoking, intelligently

417
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,240
written emails, so good job.

418
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,000
You know, because in a year I'm planning on having a sproutlet.

419
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm planning on breeding.

420
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
A spawn.

421
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm going to have Jamie spawn.

422
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,320
But, you know, I'm not going to have my little kid playing, you know, going out and playing

423
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,640
Halo when he's, you know, three or four.

424
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,700
But you know, when I'm sure that my kid, you know, has the ability, you know, understands

425
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,540
the difference between reality and fantasy then you know I wouldn't mind if

426
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,480
they're in there watching me play in Halo as long as they understand the

427
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,880
difference if they start reenacting it they get their butt popped and I tell

428
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,520
them no not enough parents spank their children either but that's another

429
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,760
story I was raised I was spanked when I was bad that's a whole nother cup of tea

430
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm not even gonna get into I'm not I'm not gonna but I'm gonna say that as a

431
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,160
parent yeah I would discipline my child if I saw them dangerously reenacting

432
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,940
something you teach them the difference between right and wrong when you just

433
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:17,300
when you when you conceive that child it is your responsibility to make sure that

434
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,380
they learn how to be a proper adult childhood is what prepares you for

435
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,180
being a grown-up all right okay I think you might get more letters on from this

436
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,420
I want more letters as long as they're intelligently written that's all yes

437
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:37,420
yeah and have good grammar. I got an email from Cameron saying hey I was

438
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,740
wondering your thoughts on Banjo-Kazooie for DS. Rare is already porting Diddy Kong

439
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,420
Racing from the 64 DS and EGM rumored that a Banjo-Kazooie game was also

440
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,360
coming to DS as a port or new. I want to know if you think it will happen also do

441
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,620
you think any Banjo-Kazooie games will make it to live arcade thank you thank

442
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,420
you for the show. First of all I won't make it a live arcade because I don't

443
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,420
Does Nintendo still have part of the rights on that?

444
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,420
I don't know. When it comes to Banjo-Kazooie, who technically owns that? Rare or Nintendo?

445
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Rare has it. I don't think you'd see it on DS at all for that reason.

446
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:14,420
But Xbox Live Arcade, definitely a possibility, but not for a long time.

447
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,420
I honestly didn't like the Banjo-Kazooie series, so I haven't...

448
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Yeah, I gotta be honest. It wasn't really a series of games I played a whole lot of.

449
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Magus, you seem to be a little more up on the know with that. Do you have any thoughts?

450
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,420
No, I haven't played Banjo-Kazooie since it came out.

451
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,420
Well, this listener is going to be very disappointed in our feedback on that one, sorry.

452
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,420
You know, if it's rare though, I think rare, Microsoft's really where they're headed,

453
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,420
I wouldn't be looking for them doing a lot on DS.

454
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,420
Diddy Kong's different, you know, because that was a Nintendo character,

455
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
and Nintendo still owns the rights, so...

456
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Yeah, they might do Banjo-Kazooie just once for old time's sake, but I doubt it.

457
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,540
But I doubt it. I don't see that happening even for old times sake just because of legal stuff

458
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,140
So well, we've got a couple more emails to go through here

459
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,920
To move forward we also have one from

460
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,160
Paul saying what was any of your worst experience with a video game store?

461
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:21,000
Wow, I need more time to think about that. Worst experience at a video game store?

462
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,400
I have to say it was EB before the GameStop merge, because there were some really not

463
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,520
knowledgeable people at a couple of the EB's I've been to. I've never had a problem at a GameStop,

464
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,080
but then again, they all know me. Yeah, you're kind of lucky in that regard. You know, I would

465
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,080
say more recently, this is kind of a weak answer, but I didn't have a lot of time to

466
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,320
think about this one, walking into a gaming store time and time again, not being able

467
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,880
to locate an Xbox 360 for many months, and kind of being laughed at when asking about

468
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
it.

469
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,360
That's, you know, it's like, you know, come on, guy, okay, I didn't pre-order it, get

470
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
over it.

471
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Just tell me if you have or not.

472
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,760
But also think about how many times they get asked that during the day.

473
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
I know, but you know what?

474
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
That's part of the job.

475
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,440
You should be used to it, you know.

476
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,320
People are going to come into the bank and ask many times a day, how do I withdraw money

477
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
for my account?

478
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,040
it's just part of the job get used to it but there's also that I actually had a

479
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,580
really awful experience at a Walmart and I think you were there with me when we

480
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:19,520
were waiting trying to get that a DS out of the not a DS an SP out of the this no

481
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,280
Julie was with me I don't recall it Julie was with me because we were

482
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,640
picking up one before before some convention and no one was coming we asked

483
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,640
people oh I don't know I don't have a key and they weren't finding anyone but

484
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
that was Walmart.

485
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,700
Logan, do you have any stories or magus, anybody?

486
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,320
I would say, there was that one time I was buying that memory card thing, kind of like

487
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,200
a, where you can rip memory card saves off of like a Playstation card.

488
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Dex Drive?

489
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,120
Yeah, like a Dex Drive, but not as a third party thing.

490
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:00,040
And the guy was acting stupid, I don't remember what he was doing, he was acting really retarded.

491
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,840
But then there was another time I was trying to buy a PSP at launch, he's all, good luck

492
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,100
finding one, hahaha, I went to Best Buy and there was like a ton of them sitting there,

493
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,540
so yeah.

494
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,020
But I remember like I said last week, I overheard in one of the Game Stops that they don't even

495
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,140
inform their employees on what games are coming out and what the games are, they basically

496
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:27,540
are told to read the Game Informer magazine, which, that's stupid.

497
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,540
Eh, whatever.

498
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
Megas?

499
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,540
Eh, mine's more of a general thing. Just, okay.

500
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,540
Tip to GameStop, EB Games, whatever.

501
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Uh, your employees are selling games.

502
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,540
They should know something about the games they're selling.

503
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,540
If you have a person that's completely clueless, you don't employ them.

504
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,540
Or you have them learn first, right?

505
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,240
From what I understand from Gametop employees I've talked to, at least that chain, Gamestop

506
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,060
has a policy where they can get magazines for free to read up on what's going on.

507
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,720
How many employees take advantage of that or whether they're encouraged to, I don't

508
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
know, I haven't worked there.

509
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,520
But I do know at least they have that policy, which is interesting.

510
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,720
I'm probably going to have to second the issue with employees mocking customers who

511
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,680
didn't pre-order their thing, didn't pre-order their product, and then are surprised that

512
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,040
it's not in stock.

513
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,960
Yeah, we know we can't always pre-order things, but you don't have to get in our face for

514
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
it.

515
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
No.

516
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,080
Honestly, I think that if you know something's going to be hard to get and you want to make

517
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,600
sure you have your copy, freakin' pre-order it.

518
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,080
It's $5 out of your pocket, and if it turns out it's something that you don't want, you

519
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,460
can move it to something else.

520
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
It's not hard.

521
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
I don't agree.

522
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,840
I don't pre-order games, and I don't like that kind of commitment, and I feel like it's

523
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,520
almost like I don't want to commit that I'm going to buy.

524
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,520
I don't care. You're not committing that you're buying it. 60 bucks. 60 bucks. That's a hell of a commitment.

525
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,520
For a game it's five dollars. For a game it's five dollars. What about a game system?

526
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Games are easy to come by. And if you don't want it, you can get your money back.

527
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,520
It's not that hard. It's in the store to credit. I feel like those stores try to force me into it.

528
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,520
It's the whole thing. I don't like being told I have to do something. Nobody does.

529
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Hey, I preordered my Xbox 360 system about when they were taking preorders.

530
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,520
And do you think that they are responsible for Microsoft's error?

531
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,520
No, I think they are responsible for taking the amount of preorders that they are going to get systems.

532
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,520
They did take the number of preorders that they thought they were getting systems and then Microsoft screwed them over.

533
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Well that's their problem. That's not my problem.

534
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
That's Microsoft's problem.

535
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
No, that is their problem.

536
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
They didn't they didn't create the shortage

537
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,080
Microsoft did if you have an issue with it you take it to Microsoft the one who created the problem if I have a customer

538
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,560
Doesn't get their movies on time because the said company or whatever doesn't ship them on time. It's our problem

539
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Not that I completely disagree

540
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,320
Well, you go and tell your customer. Oh, I'm sorry. You can't get your system because Microsoft didn't ship it call Microsoft

541
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,940
They're gonna say fuck you. Why did you say I can get one on launch date then? I'm sorry. That's called stupid customer

542
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,720
That's called a customer doesn't want to shop and pre-order any of their games that's called the customer is a lazy-ass

543
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,320
No, it's that's exactly how I feel to inform their customers if they inform them exactly the source

544
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,820
Hey, they had shortages before with the PlayStation 2 if they knew that this was gonna be a typical problem

545
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,440
They could say you know any Microsoft two completely different companies

546
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,440
companies. How is what one company do illustrate what another company is going to do? Please

547
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,480
answer that. Tell me exactly how is the behavior of a completely different entity going to

548
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,320
explain how another completely different entity is going to perform.

549
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,600
The companies operate in a similar fashion as far as hardware launches.

550
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,920
Microsoft doesn't have to deal with having their orders come from basically a foreign

551
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,740
source. Microsoft is all located this side of the country. Anything that Sony does has

552
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,060
to have approval from Sony of Japan.

553
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,160
Actually Microsoft systems, I believe, were being manufactured in foreign countries.

554
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,820
It doesn't matter where it's manufactured, it matters where the business decisions are

555
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,820
being made.

556
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:20,980
Anyway, to go on to the next email, we also have one from Ricky.

557
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:28,340
It says, one of our 15 year old listeners, says he's been listening to our show for the

558
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,220
past two years and he's quite impressed.

559
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,940
Let's get to the point, is what it says.

560
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,500
Anyway, I was browsing around on the net and I stumbled across a gif, which happened to

561
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,260
be someone's avatar for a certain forum, um, from the image of this year's E3.

562
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,140
It was Ken Kutaragi, um, actually you did spell it right, kudos to you, um, wording

563
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,740
his, uh, mouth to the phrase Ridge Racer and it kept playing the words back and forth.

564
00:38:50,740 --> 00:39:01,700
Um, he recognized a face in this, um, it says that none other, it actually said it was Rob

565
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
in this GIF?

566
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,520
Yeah, I've actually, you know what, somebody posted something similar in our forums that

567
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,400
supposedly there's some reaction shot of me at some press conference, but here's the thing

568
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
guys, it's not me.

569
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,400
At least the picture I saw wasn't me, I guess I didn't even think the guy looked like me,

570
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,120
but maybe there's something, I tried going into the mailbag and looking at it and there

571
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,800
was no GIF image attached, so I would ask that listener to try resending it, but just

572
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,140
so you know, when the Sony press conference was going on, we were not there.

573
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,260
We were not at any of the big three press conferences.

574
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,940
I wish we were that popular amongst them, but unfortunately not all those companies

575
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:40,840
have embraced podcasting yet, with the exception of Microsoft, but of course, you know, Major

576
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,860
Nelson works for them, so that's the podcast that's definitely going to be...

577
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,920
Actually, I would say Microsoft a little more than the others, you know, even, because I

578
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,560
know some other friendly podcasts we know of went to that conference, so that's cool.

579
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,740
But anyway, regardless, during the Sony Prep Conference, we were actually at the Arena

580
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:04,940
a lounge in Santa Monica watching it on the big screen TV on a live feed and nobody was

581
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,180
taking pictures of our reaction shots and really I didn't have a problem with Sony's

582
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,420
conference until the very end to be honest and then kind of sitting back and reflecting

583
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,820
on it, it just kind of got worse so I really don't think that pictures me because I don't

584
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
know where it came from.

585
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,700
It's like eating bad McDonald's, it was bad to begin with and then just kind of festers

586
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,060
in your stomach.

587
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:32,180
And also, I spend most of E3 hanging out with either Loki, Dark Sakura, or Bobby from All

588
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,260
Games, so if you don't see them in the picture either, it's probably not me.

589
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,260
Sorry.

590
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,900
Also, we got an email and I'm using this as an example.

591
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,660
Someone sent us an email that consists of only, hi.

592
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,020
Don't send me emails that just say hi, because what I'm going to do in the future when I

593
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:56,180
see emails like this is I'm going to delete it and keep a list of your name.

594
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:01,540
Well hi back I guess. I appreciate you taking the time to send such a

595
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,820
thoughtful and well-written email. I'm not mentioning the person's name on.

596
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,440
They also didn't put a subject in there all they wrote was hi. You know now we're

597
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,540
gonna get like 30 emails this week just say hi hi hi. And what I will do is on

598
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:23,220
on our forum I will post their email addresses so that we can sign them up for some porn

599
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,220
filters.

600
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,660
I think you really need it by posting them to the forum and probably just do that automatically

601
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,140
with all those bots out there.

602
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,700
Yeah, there is that.

603
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,860
Any other emails besides the high email?

604
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,500
Just the ones that worship me as their goddess and, you know, those I usually just send to

605
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
my personal email.

606
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,580
Oh yeah, all one of those emails.

607
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,580
Hey!

608
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
Alright.

609
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,220
You can shut the hell up right now.

610
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,460
Magus got a total zing there. You sent yourself.

611
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,580
That is bull. My husband sent him.

612
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,580
DM, I need some ATH points for Magus. A good five points for him please.

613
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:01,260
You know what? You need to... I think he's upgraded from toilet paper to

614
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,980
a cardboard box for his jokebook. Alright, anyway, we gotta keep it moving here.

615
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,940
Again, if you have emails, mail back at Orangelaunchradio.com

616
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,620
During the break here, live only, we were talking about some gaming pieces that were

617
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,380
in the media recently.

618
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,660
One piece we were saving here for part B was Nightline.

619
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:29,100
Basically what happened is that Nightline recently did this story here talking about

620
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,540
the Pentagon and how kind of dumb they looked when they mistook a bit of Mashima for a terrorist

621
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,700
training tool and showed it to the House Intelligence Committee.

622
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,580
Tapper basically said this, terrorists twisting an American video game into a jihadist training

623
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,080
tool and then proceeds to lay out how the whole thing happened, including getting an

624
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,740
anonymous interview with a European gamer who created the now infamous terrorist battlefield

625
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,220
clip.

626
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,500
The Pentagon is still claiming that the mashema is being used by terrorists.

627
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,320
Tapper is calling bullshit on this excuse and tells the Pentagon so, basically.

628
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,720
And there's a quote here, uh, we should really be questioning the kind of advice that Congress

629
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,780
is getting, and that comes from, uh, Georgia Tech Ian Boggess, who's in the piece.

630
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:23,260
It was a parody of, um, Team America World Police.

631
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,400
That's what the machimo was.

632
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
That's very interesting.

633
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,520
So, I don't know, that was interesting to you.

634
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,520
stupid intelligence, but kind of unrelated to that whole thing, the Fragdolls and the

635
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:47,520
PMS Clan, they're boycotting the World Series of Video Gaming, Grolov, I guess, contest

636
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,320
or whatever. They're doing some pageant contests that has to do with the World Series of Video

637
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:59,440
Games. The Miss WSVG contest, and the only game-related requirement for the contestants

638
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,640
are, you know, to list what their favorite game is. And of course that didn't sit too

639
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:17,160
well with either clan, which basically protesting the contest by holding their own guy talent

640
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,620
con- or beauty contest as well. It says it's not really a video gamer who will be crowned,

641
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:34,180
a model. And that was the PMS co-founder Amber Dalton who told the Courier Journal. And basically,

642
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:40,340
I don't know, one of the funny things that I keep seeing back is the, like for example,

643
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:46,020
the World Series of video games they shot back with. The Fragdolls in PMS Clan have

644
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:53,300
stated that they plan to run the Mr. WSVG competition in the Tourist Next Stop in Dallas.

645
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:59,060
If this happens, in order to be fair, the World Series of Video Gaming may feel compelled

646
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,820
to run another beauty contest as well.

647
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,540
And then of course, other gamers who have been reading this are saying, well, those

648
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,140
two clans suck anyways as far as gaming goes, they don't even compete on a professional

649
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,140
level.

650
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,940
So I thought that was funny.

651
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,180
I don't really know enough about those clans to pass judgment on it, so I'm just going

652
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,860
to refrain from commenting, although I would love to have a representative on the program

653
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,260
at some point to kind of give their perspective.

654
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,740
I know that they've been given a lot of shit online about how many...

655
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,900
I think the PMS Clan specifically, they have their gamer cards linked on Xbox.com, and

656
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,740
I think like most of them have under 1k points, except one girl's got a ton.

657
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,580
But then they say, well that's because we're playing Halo 2 and you don't get points for

658
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,580
that.

659
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,580
Yeah, they have Halo 2.

660
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,860
But the other thing that I thought was funny was...

661
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,000
It's just, you know, and with all respect to them, because again I don't know them,

662
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,580
It does seem interesting though, they are linked from xbox.com, wouldn't you knowing

663
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,920
that, wanna buff up the 360 games?

664
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
I don't know.

665
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,240
I know they play Halo 2 a lot, granted, and one of the funny things I was reading is that

666
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:12,160
they're actually coming out with their casual gaming portion of the clan.

667
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,520
So there's gonna be some experts at UNO or something, I don't know.

668
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,520
But I'm all for a casual game, you don't have to be hardcore all the time.

669
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,920
Are you going to be entering the Hot Man competition, Loki?

670
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
I think you should be in it.

671
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,080
I think it would be funny, because you know they're going to get all these, you know,

672
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,080
male models.

673
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,080
Well, here's the problem, though.

674
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,080
I think Loki should be up there.

675
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,080
Here's the problem, though.

676
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,800
It's in Dallas, and it's also, they're a ways away.

677
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Chat room?

678
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,680
I think we should have someone go on there in an asbestos suit and set themselves on

679
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
fire.

680
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:47,680
chat room, who would like to contribute to a Send Loki to Dallas fund?

681
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:56,240
Our other sales branches in Dallas. Well there you go, you need to take a work trip.

682
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,880
You know, the whole argument with the fact that they don't have a lot of gamer points

683
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,520
doesn't really count with me, because if you're playing a lot of multiplayer games and stuff,

684
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,200
not a lot of points may be coming from that, especially if you're not playing like, you

685
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,480
know, which, although, although the PMS clan, I think it was the PMS clan, I can't remember

686
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,480
which one's sponsored by Ubisoft, they have, they better be, you know, having high achievement

687
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,320
points because, you know, they gotta be playing the new Ghost Recon, and the only system you

688
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:33,200
gotta be playing now is the 360, so, well you should be playing on the 360 because that's

689
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,080
the best one all right well we'll see what happens with that and I do we just

690
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,840
want pictures of the winners on all ends just send us some sexy pictures of the

691
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,080
winners from all the contests that's all we asked for I have nothing nothing

692
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,920
against you know female clans I mean especially if they're competing out

693
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,160
there great you know just great I mean just don't you know make it sound like

694
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,920
you're the best people in the world we need to have like the oil army as a

695
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,880
gaming clan I thought about that except I suck we have a lot of girls that

696
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,440
listen to this show for just various games that aren't your supermodel girl

697
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,720
types that Microsoft's would want to flaunt about at their booth or whatever

698
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,960
that's just fine by me I like my girls normal you know not that I date girls

699
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,320
but you know I like socializing with normal girls you know I and I say we

700
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,240
form a clan and all that stuff let's do it send some emails if you're interested

701
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,940
It's not just women. We can have a clan on a chrome hounds. We are get that no

702
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,660
We're going to be the multi-game clan the old army. Well, they're gonna have actual clans and chrome hounds. So I

703
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:48,880
You have to go army. All right. Anyway, let's move on here. We got to get to this story about the PSP

704
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:54,940
And we haven't heard a lot of great, you know stuff system selling at things coming to the PSP

705
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,020
But this might be something that turns some heads

706
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:02,980
there's going to be a TiVo update and what the next TiVo update will do is

707
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,700
it's going to convert TiVo shows into PSP friendly formats by the way you can

708
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,660
also convert it for iPod or trio it's only going to cost $25 for that

709
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,500
functionality which by the way you can find utilities on the internet to do it

710
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,340
for free but okay whatever it's going to be a legal and blessed thing from TiVo

711
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:30,380
So it's kind of interesting because now the PSP can kind of you know have that hey put your TiVo programs here on your PSP

712
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,740
That might be something to sell the PSP and certainly I get more competitive with the iPod even though

713
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,600
I don't know iPod and PSP are so different anyway

714
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,660
But for some people when it's one or the other that might be something that kind of you know

715
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,700
Makes the PSP look a little more alluring too

716
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:51,020
I think it's just that they're gonna be planning on doing this anyways with the whole ps3 and the you know

717
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,460
was it a

718
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,400
their wireless some streaming system that they've got their

719
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,780
the location free players so they're probably going to be bringing something very similar

720
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:07,820
Alright. Guess what?

721
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:12,660
What? You remember when we played that Pirates of the Caribbean game?

722
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,660
Yes, at E3.

723
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:20,040
Well it's been officially stated Johnny Depp is doing his

724
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,520
lending his voice talent to the game for Captain Jack Sparrow

725
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,320
oh yeah that game I thought was pretty cool

726
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,480
you know had all kinds of little hidden stuff thrown in it you know what I did

727
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,120
notice

728
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,840
you know remember though that they didn't have a

729
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,160
dude in it

730
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,000
why is the name suddenly escaping me? I'm Johnny Depp

731
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,080
thank you no no Orlando Bloom thank you

732
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,680
he isn't they actually got a voice

733
00:50:49,680 --> 00:51:00,320
a similar voice to it. But there's a quote on here from Johnny Depp that doing voiceovers

734
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,560
is a great fun and a lot easier than stumbling about pretending to be Keith Richards or having

735
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,320
scissors glued to your fingers all day. He did not add.

736
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,520
You know, all things considered, the game looked decent.

737
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,520
That wasn't a quote, by the way.

738
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,040
I know, it looked like your typical movie to game translation, but on the, you know,

739
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,880
they didn't fuck it up, and like the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory games, you know,

740
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,020
they didn't fuck it up.

741
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,340
It looked pretty solid, I think, but the Johnny Depp quotient is going to sell a lot more

742
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,340
of this title.

743
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,200
I think it was a smart clinching there to get the game on board.

744
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,640
This announcement here, though, is from Eurogamer, so I love the jokes they're putting in here.

745
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,480
For example, they said, why are pirates called pirates?

746
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,040
Because they are.

747
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Oh my god. That's so bad. Wow. That's fantastic. That was bad. But yeah, we saw this when we

748
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,840
saw the demo at E3. It was pretty cool. It was a pretty neat little game. If you're a

749
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,280
fan of the movies, you'll get a kick out of it. It'll entertain you for a little while.

750
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:10,280
Really, really hokey. That joke there. Anyways, as far as Xbox Live, there's going to be some

751
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,640
is Xbox Live. There's going to be some demos coming soon. The first one of course, which

752
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:22,160
should have come out by now but hasn't, Prey is supposed to be hitting Xbox Live Marketplace

753
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,760
pretty soon. If you can't wait though and you have a decent enough PC, you can actually

754
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,820
download the PC demo for free on a lot of the major gaming sites, so definitely check

755
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:36,160
that out. The other demo that's also slated for August 1st, which would be Saints Row,

756
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,880
and that's going to be coming pretty soon. I think sometime in July, Texas Hold'em is

757
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,320
supposed to be coming out so lots of good stuff hopefully and no word on

758
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:52,360
streetfare yet so that kind of sucks all right um what we want to do now is allow

759
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:58,000
dark Sakura to tell us what website she's been looking at this week because

760
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,120
she serves the internet up and down left and right front and back all over and

761
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,480
tries to find the website that you need to be looking at this week so dark

762
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,900
Sakura where should kids be pointing their browsers this week this is a site

763
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,960
that I spend quite a bit of time on and you know it's not actually just because

764
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:23,700
I also moderate there is gorillas unofficial it I was a big fan of this

765
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,860
site before I was you know asked on as one of the moderators there and

766
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:35,640
basically this I have to say to Jay he's so amazing with how quickly he gets the

767
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,320
updates up any any new information that said he has it up on there they're linked

768
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,300
through live journal if you add a gorillas news to your live journal feed

769
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,820
it goes directly off gorillasunofficial.com it's actually gorillas-unofficial.com

770
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,100
the forms there are great well maintained again not just because I'm

771
00:53:54,100 --> 00:54:00,420
also working with you but everybody there is just really terrific they're

772
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,980
not just that but if you go into the site actually on the splash page there's

773
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:11,980
There's new art features by people in the fan art community, other fans, some official

774
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,980
photos.

775
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,900
You'll see something different every time.

776
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:21,940
On top of that, this has probably, I'd say, one of the most complete lyrics, image, discography,

777
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,940
everything.

778
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:31,320
And there's even a translation on here by my friend Haruna, who translated what Noodle

779
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,540
said on the Apex tapes back when she was only speaking Japanese.

780
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:38,540
So check it out. Very cool site. I've been impressed with them from day one.

781
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,540
But what if I don't like gorillas?

782
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,540
Then screw you.

783
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,540
Okay. Alright.

784
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,540
Then why don't you? What's wrong with you?

785
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,540
I like gorillas, just why. You know I love to be devil's advocate, though.

786
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,540
I know.

787
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:58,540
Exactly. But, I don't know. I'm not a huge fan of gorillas. Sorry. What can I say? I'm picky.

788
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,540
It's because you like listening to porno music. That's why.

789
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,540
Porno music. Hell yeah.

790
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:09,580
What I am a fan of is good racing games, and Forza Motorsport 2, they had some details

791
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,580
come out about that.

792
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:17,820
It's supposed to be the big competition against Gran Turismo HD, which I don't really want

793
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,500
to comment on that game.

794
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:26,140
Anyways, what's kind of interesting is they described the brand new damage system in Forza

795
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:32,860
2, and this is all coming from the latest issue of the 360 magazine, including that

796
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:37,580
it took six months to create. Three damage settings will be available in the game, low,

797
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:45,360
normal, and simulation for those who don't want to, they joke, reenact the great Gizmondo

798
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:53,640
Ferrari crash. For photo and TV modes, they're actually collaborating with the Project Gotham

799
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,660
development team, Bizarre Creations. So they're going to have something similar to Forza,

800
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,020
as far as the TV very similar to Gotham TV that was in

801
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,660
Project Gotham Racing 3 and of course better AI

802
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,540
better graphics, downloadable content, yada yada yada yada

803
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,180
Is that official to yada yada yada yada?

804
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,140
That's all for me, you hit her here first yada yada yada yada

805
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,460
Hooray!

806
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,180
Actually

807
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,260
as far as other stuff

808
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,020
Going on and actually I'm sure that

809
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,660
Megas here would appreciate this

810
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,620
Blizzard's got some new ideas for World of Warcraft. Oh

811
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,820
Really yeah, really

812
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,580
Basically

813
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,020
There's a new transfer assist

814
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:55,300
They're preparing a new transfer system that will let World of Warcraft players move their characters to less polluted realms for a $25 fee

815
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,780
They're basically wanting to

816
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:07,500
Offer these services for convenience as opposed to encouraging people to spread out through the realms

817
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,300
But it's been asked for before so they're deciding to make it a

818
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,620
a service that will be available.

819
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,500
I've been reading the forums about that seems to be a bit

820
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,600
seems to be a bit of a backlash uh... people think it's too expensive people

821
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,240
think it's not worth the effort

822
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,980
it's like come on either you pay for the transfer which is just expensive enough

823
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,820
to

824
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,860
keep players from say

825
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,340
invading a realm and crashing it

826
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,340
seriously

827
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,820
I mean the alternative is just to re-roll in completely new characters so

828
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,240
it's not much of a decision there

829
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,920
There will be restrictions on realm transfers, you can only bring a character once every

830
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,420
six months and once you've transferred you can't take them back.

831
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,440
The character has to be at least level 10, there's the amount of cash you can bring with

832
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:03,460
you 300 gold for levels 10-30, 1000 for 31-50 and 5000-51 and above.

833
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:12,540
You can only transfer to realms of the same type, PVP, PvE, I guess roleplay ones too.

834
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:18,540
They're also talking about cross realm battleground feature that's coming in with patch 1.12.

835
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,540
That's cool.

836
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:25,480
It will link Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so you can fight with players

837
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,480
from other realms.

838
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,700
Hopefully they don't link the fucking looking for group channel across multiple servers.

839
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:40,000
F, G, W, S, G. I mean, okay, devil's advocate here. Yay, so we can have our Bluebee groups

840
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,260
trashed by tier three, no matter where they are. I mean, what's, what are the odds, you

841
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:56,380
figure, of Cross Realm Battlegrounds having, okay, you have this basic pick-up group, unskilled

842
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:02,120
players facing completely organized, over voice chat people are just going to roll straight

843
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,120
over them.

844
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,120
Can't hold you on, don't go there.

845
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,220
Same rule on Ragnarok, you know, if you don't want to, you know, you don't do War of Imperium

846
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,640
if you're level 10.

847
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,560
Step up or ship out, bitch.

848
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:17,560
There's a big gap between raiders and non-raiders, and you see that a lot on the forums.

849
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:23,600
The people who do the big raid instances do better in PvP, it's not much a matter of skill.

850
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:29,560
I think they should call it World of Warcraft Hardcore Edition for the hardcore.

851
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:36,760
Also patch 1.12 is going to bring in a new type of Rogue PVP.

852
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:43,120
You will see Horde and Alliance players trying to gain control of strategic positions.

853
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,820
And Rogues will get a talent review.

854
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:50,600
To this I say it's about damn time on both counts.

855
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,360
have needed a talent change for a while they just need some tweaks and world PVP

856
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,700
because of battlegrounds because there are actually objectives in

857
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:04,120
battlegrounds has effectively killed off world PVP so both of those need a

858
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,480
revamp I'm glad they're getting them hmm I you know I'm going back to the price

859
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,400
for a minute for character transfer I think $25 is fair actually they agree

860
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,720
because it makes sure the people really want to do it and it's not just people

861
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,760
taking advantage of it because even if it was $5 I think $25 means that it's

862
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,400
only people who really want to be with their friends and really want to do it

863
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,280
you know because otherwise I think this would just be happening left and right

864
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,160
and it would just get too confusing and all this stuff so I'm kind I'm glad I

865
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,480
think it's a smart idea and I think I think Final Fantasy 11 badly needs to

866
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,000
implement something similar honestly but that's just my opinion what do I know

867
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:47,360
was that a dark soccer I'm sorry doesn't okay then I guess then we'll give the

868
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,020
microphone back to Loki so he can do his next story. Thank you very much. In between the

869
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,800
porn surfing, what are you doing over there, Loki? I'm not searching for porn. Sure. I'm

870
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,980
trying to get my program newsletter to work because it's not, it wants me to buy it. Alright.

871
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:05,040
Don't want to. Anyways, um, although if you don't want to buy stuff and you want to save

872
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,000
some money, well you're still going to have to buy stuff, but if you want to save some

873
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,960
money on some 360 games, try maybe buying region free games. Like for example, stuff

874
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:20,960
from PlayAsia. They're offering MotoGP 2006 which just came out in the 360 for $59.99

875
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:27,680
here in the States. You can buy it actually, the Asian version for $39.99. Guess what?

876
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:32,920
It's region free, you can play it on your system. So you actually save 20 bucks. So

877
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:38,840
that's kind of neat. And they actually have a few games that are like that. Not sure if

878
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,120
they're going to change that in the future, but something to look into if you're thinking

879
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,560
about buying games or buy yous like I do.

880
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:51,040
We're not going to open up our skype line over at www.orangelandsradio.com, click on

881
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,040
interact with us.

882
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,880
However, I wish to announce here for our fourth birthday some pretty major changes with the

883
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,720
skype line and just kind of our reasonings why we're doing it.

884
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,040
First off, we here at Orange Lawns Radio do not like to edit the show unless we absolutely

885
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,120
have to.

886
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,400
We would never edit out someone's opinion on anything.

887
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,960
The only thing we edit out are complete fuck-ups like when we forget to start the show right

888
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,400
or whatever, the story is not up that we need, or what have you.

889
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,200
And now though, we're going to start editing out Skype calls that are not up to a certain

890
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:26,240
quality standard, and we don't want to scare you guys off from calling in.

891
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,720
That's not what we're trying to do.

892
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,920
We're never going to censor your opinions, but the problem is just based on some feedback

893
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,680
that we're getting from folks that are listening to the show and posting on the forums and

894
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,580
talking to friends is that unfortunately some of the quality calls we just can't afford

895
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,880
to keep leaving in the show because it's kind of starting to bring the show down.

896
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:49,540
So please guys, before you call in using Skype, please use Echo 1-2-3 to call in first to

897
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:55,860
make sure your connection is okay or pick up the phone and call 916-226-9067 if you

898
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,260
are the person that pays the bill because that's probably a toll call.

899
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,580
Now that being said, the phone isn't always 100% efficient, especially if you're using

900
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,760
a cell phone.

901
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,180
Please don't be offended if we hang up on you due to quality control issues.

902
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,420
Just for the betterment of the show try again next week or leave us a voicemail

903
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:19,180
Orange launch radio is on all the time on Skype and you can actually call in leave us a voicemail and actually

904
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:24,980
What I'd like to know your opinions on this week for the voicemail. We're gonna start making this a regular segment

905
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,980
I would really like to hear your voicemails later

906
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:32,020
actually, I'll give you the topic after the Skype calls because then otherwise people want to call in and talk about it, but we're gonna

907
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,020
have like a

908
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,760
weekly topic to call in about. So anyway, let's go to the phone's Skype line and

909
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,160
see what you guys have to say.

910
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? It's Ranma. Can you hear me now?

911
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:50,760
Of course I can hear you. What's up, Ranma? What's on your mind? Not much. I've probably recovered from Anime Next last weekend.

912
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,960
From Anime Next? How was that? It was fun, but there was a lot of drama with the

913
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,760
game room, but I'll save that for later.

914
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,400
Well, no, I want to hear it. What was the drama in the game room? Have you heard of desktop arcade?

915
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,680
Yes. They were banned from AnimeNext.

916
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,200
Wow, what did they do? They were at Fonome. What did they do? A desktop arcade, they're the ones that make the

917
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,440
popping music controllers and the beat media controllers, right?

918
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:17,520
Ooh, what'd they do? I wanna know. It seems that somebody stole their passes from last year,

919
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,320
photocopied them, and went into the game room. And it seems that the guy who

920
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,720
runs the game room, Kevin, who's also known as Assembler,

921
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,040
who owns Assembler.org, basically blacklisted them from the con.

922
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,440
and whenever you mention it on the forums about why they weren't there

923
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,680
he will go in and edit your post and delete it as if it never existed

924
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,720
that's a little weird that's almost a little too hardcore they didn't post

925
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,400
anything like why they're gone or whatever

926
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,520
nope every time you ask them why or whatever

927
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,080
your post is deleted that's freaky that's like a KGB thing

928
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,800
I came very close to getting banned on the forums when I stopped because if I got banned

929
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,520
I know senior staffs that would probably have his head on a fucking platter

930
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,480
should we call make a call to desktop arcade get one of them on the show try

931
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,520
to get their side of the story

932
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,840
sure why not I can arrange that open it you know what open invite you tell him

933
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,160
we want him I'd love to hear it

934
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,000
wouldn't you guys? I am, I see you guys, alright let's hear it

935
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,560
anyway sorry buddy what what else is going on in anime next? it was pretty fun

936
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,600
um it was hot as hell but luckily my hotel was like

937
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,080
15 feet away from Expo Center it was huge it was great

938
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,400
The only thing that really sucked was the acoustics.

939
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,880
Hmm, what was wrong with the acoustics? Just, you know,

940
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,920
hard to hear things and sound bouncing everywhere or what?

941
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,160
Yes, think of it as a giant warehouse and they were dividing everything

942
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,720
with these heavy curtains.

943
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,040
What kind of cool video game related things did you see there? I know it's a

944
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,860
lot of anime, but since we're a gaming show, what kind of cool video game things did you see there?

945
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,040
Not too much, because I went into the game room,

946
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,640
the funk just hit me and I passed out. But I did!

947
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,360
I did go into the dealers room. I did see some DS lights on imports white

948
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,840
PSP's

949
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,840
Okay, so a lot of import games

950
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Ranma, yes, I was actually hanging out with my friend Julie yesterday and she's going to anime Expo this year

951
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,060
Yeah, I have no the only reason I see to go there this year's cuz clamps there

952
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,360
Yeah, I want to go but my wizard costume is not done

953
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:23,520
Well, she's talking about buying some of those miniature bottles of Febreze to go around

954
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,440
spraying the fanboy funk.

955
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,120
I will praise her if she does that.

956
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,560
Allow us to take this opportunity, boys and girls, to remind you, when you are of a certain

957
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:37,120
age, it is critically important, and actually you really should do this when you're a child,

958
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,000
and if you're old enough to figure out how to download the show and listen to it and

959
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,320
all that fun stuff, you are probably this age.

960
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:47,920
It is important that you bathe on a regular basis, that you use soap to clean the germs

961
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,040
off your body, and that you use something like deodorant, cologne, I don't know, something

962
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:57,520
to make sure that you're going to smell unoffensive when you're in a room tightly packed, especially

963
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:02,740
a hot room, as Rama's telling us, this con was pretty hot, around all these people.

964
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:08,140
So please, don't give gamers a bad name, such as these folks at Anime Next that were stinking

965
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:15,460
up the room, bathe regularly, and, you know, bring the smell of flowers into gaming rooms

966
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,460
everywhere.

967
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:23,600
And I knew a person, I actually met somebody at Anime Expo a few years ago who actually

968
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,200
was one of those, I'm going to sleep in the lobby of the hotel or in the movie room type

969
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:36,040
people, only he actually would go into the men's room and clean himself at the sink.

970
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:40,640
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, Bandit in the chat room has the best idea ever for a

971
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,640
cosplay.

972
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,880
Someone should dress up as a big bottle of Febreze.

973
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:51,880
There's one for you. One anime con when they passed out their registration bags had little bars of soap in each of the bags.

974
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,880
And don't you know the people got pissed off and offended.

975
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,880
I would actually like to quote my friend Megzi.

976
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,880
Okay.

977
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,880
Hobo. Horrible otaku body odor.

978
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:09,880
Why would you be offended at that? I look at it as a free gift. People fucking steal hotel soap all the time.

979
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,880
You know what I say the cons should do?

980
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,880
What?

981
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:23,880
They should have an anonymous shower room. Take one of the hotel rooms, someone just stands there with a sheet, you go in, sign in, take your shower, and leave. 100% anonymous.

982
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:31,880
Wow. Alright, anyway, we gotta wrap this up so we can get to another call, but any other thoughts on the cons or gaming or what have you?

983
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:36,880
It was fun, overall. I'm gonna post a couple of links and that's it. The first one's for Jamie.

984
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,880
Ron would have cosplay in full effect. There was a bunch of Ron would have cosplays running around.

985
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,560
Alright. Alright, thank you very much, Rama, for the call. I appreciate it, okay?

986
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,760
Sure. No problem.

987
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,640
Later, buddy.

988
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,120
Later.

989
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,320
We always like it when he calls in.

990
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:55,240
DMN, I need some ATH points to Bandit. I know it's your contest, but Bandit,

991
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,520
come on. That was some points right there. Let's go to another phone call.

992
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,360
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

993
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,600
Hi, Skye. It's Ravenstaufen.

994
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,200
Hey, Ravenstaufen. What's on your mind, buddy?

995
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,640
Phoenix Wright.

996
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,120
Phoenix Wright. You know, I've kind of looked at this game a little bit. It's kind of neat.

997
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,420
What what if you just recently started playing this game?

998
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:19,340
Sort of I bought it for a week and I found it in EB for 30 bucks and it it rocks really

999
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,960
What do you lucky you what do you like about Phoenix, right?

1000
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:29,220
Well, I just like that. The music is great when you have nailed someone it goes like objection you did this

1001
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,860
Okay, wait a meek Latov just walked in the room. So I've got to put him on the spot here meek Latov. You've been playing

1002
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,300
Phoenix right turn finished it. What did you think of that?

1003
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,820
What do you love so much about the game? It's like playing law and order

1004
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:48,220
That's pretty much what I like and it's funny. It's really really funny. Well, what's so funny about it?

1005
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,380
There's nothing funny about law

1006
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:55,980
The writing is really hilarious and the names they come up with for the characters like Lotta Hart and

1007
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,440
Somebody von Karma. I forget his yeah

1008
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:04,820
Manfred von Karma and it was seriously like the evil voice, right?

1009
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,820
Right?

1010
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,820
OBJECTION!

1011
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,220
It's, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.

1012
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,100
I have all these other games I was playing too, and I was like, I'm not taking this out

1013
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,100
of my DS.

1014
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,980
It just seems to me like that game has an awful lot of reading though, so what keeps

1015
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,380
this game kind of interesting?

1016
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,380
Skye.

1017
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,380
Yes, Raven's Dolphin.

1018
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:24,900
Uh, because it has a lot of reading, I read pretty well, I don't, I can't read a book,

1019
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,900
but I can read games.

1020
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,900
Well, it's not like I can't read, Raven's Dolphin, but if I want to read, I'll read

1021
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:29,900
a book.

1022
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,940
It's an engaging story, each chapter, so it's not like you want to put it down.

1023
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:37,040
I mean I've heard a lot of great things about the game, so it's just when I was kind of watching you play it

1024
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:41,060
I was kind of like this looks like a lot of reading for a video game. I can understand that but then again

1025
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:45,180
You know what so is final fan any of the Super Nintendo Final Fantasy so you had to read a lot in those games

1026
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:50,860
Too really, so I'm let's slide two words about Phoenix, right that will sell it to anyone Mike Meekins

1027
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:54,380
You will find out once you play through it Mike Meekins

1028
01:10:55,020 --> 01:11:02,020
Oh, it took him a minute ravens often Meekins is what they're making another one for the DS called justice for all

1029
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:07,060
That's all I wanted to call for I'm getting that launch day, and there's a Phoenix coming out, right?

1030
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:13,020
Okay, thank you, just tell us real quick wait before you go back. How does it work in Japan?

1031
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,860
There's the different games in Japan how many are out in Japan and what's been translated over here three on Gameboy Advance?

1032
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:23,500
And then they're making a new one on DS 4 and it doesn't have Phoenix right in it anymore

1033
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:28,260
At least that we know of so far. It's a different attorney this time. Hmm and

1034
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:37,260
And what's really cool is my coworker, she wasn't able to get the American one, but they just re-released the Japanese one in Japan.

1035
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,260
And it has a... of course they released it in Japan if it's Japanese.

1036
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:44,260
Yeah, you can toggle between English or Japanese in the game.

1037
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:51,260
So if you can't find it in America right now, you can go on an import site and just get that re-release of the Japanese one.

1038
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,260
You can still play it in English.

1039
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,260
Awesome.

1040
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:59,160
Ravis Dolphin, any other thoughts there on Phoenix Riot or gaming in general?

1041
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:03,840
What was the worst game you ever played in your life?

1042
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,260
I can tell you mine. It was Deadly Towers for the Nest. That game was horrible.

1043
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:16,920
Worst game I've ever played in my life. Oh my gosh.

1044
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,480
Do you remember

1045
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,760
Color Dreams?

1046
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:26,340
Which was a company that created these games on the NES that were in those like really colored cartridges.

1047
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,320
They made a game called Master Chew and the Drunk Nerd Who.

1048
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,320
Where you're basically ghost busting.

1049
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,320
It's fucking horrible. What?

1050
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,320
Where you're like basically ghost busting. I can't even remember.

1051
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,320
I don't even remember. I just remember.

1052
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:40,820
It was bad.

1053
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:43,820
Running this game and being like 10 years old and going like, what a crap.

1054
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,820
How about this one? The NES version of X-Men.

1055
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,820
Yeah, that was horrible.

1056
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:52,820
That was awful!

1057
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,820
Or most people would say...

1058
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,820
The Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man.

1059
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:57,820
Oh god.

1060
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,820
Or E.T.

1061
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:00,820
E.T. was worse.

1062
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:01,820
Superman 64.

1063
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:07,820
I hate to be trendy here and kind of saying what everybody else says, but honestly, dude,

1064
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,820
Wand of Gamelon, Zelda, fucking horrible.

1065
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,820
I'm sorry.

1066
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,820
I got to play it at Classic Gaming Expo.

1067
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,820
It really is that bad.

1068
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,820
I'm sorry for you, Sky.

1069
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:17,820
You had to play that.

1070
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,980
I had to because I feel like it's like my journalistic responsibility,

1071
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,720
you know, I know you're laughing at the term journalist, but I feel like it's my

1072
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,320
responsibility to listeners of the show to play that game at least once and see

1073
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,600
if it really is as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

1074
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:36,160
It is really that bad and I'm sure you can even download the movies on YouTube

1075
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,560
and that doesn't even begin

1076
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,160
just because the gameplay itself is horrible. I mean, what was Nintendo thinking

1077
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,280
letting these guys just

1078
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,480
poop on the Link franchise? These guys literally shit on Link.

1079
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,280
Okay, now that you're our guinea pig, go play Big Rigs.

1080
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,560
I would rather not. They crapped on Mario to

1081
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,760
Mario's Hotel? That was horrible. Oh god, yadda yadda yadda.

1082
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,560
Alright, Ravenstaufen, thanks for the question. Actually, there's another game that I thought was

1083
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,400
pretty awful. What's that?

1084
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,040
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. I would- I hate you.

1085
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:09,480
I wouldn't put it in worst game ever though, because- It's not worst game ever,

1086
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,560
however, it shouldn't have carried the Final Fantasy name because it was way too much of a

1087
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,000
child's game. Okay, okay.

1088
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,640
It fit the niche that it was designed for, though. It was an entry-level RPG.

1089
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:23,280
Right, but you're right. A, it shouldn't have been Final Fantasy. What I will give that game, though, is that it actually has a pretty kick-ass soundtrack.

1090
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:28,560
Yeah. All things considered. I mean, whoever did... I know it was a female that did the music there, and I think she

1091
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,840
came over to... I could be wrong, but I think she made some of the music in XI.

1092
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,960
I might be wrong. Don't quote me on that. But it's got a great soundtrack, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

1093
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:39,280
You know, now that I think about it, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest would probably have fit in better

1094
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,600
had they called it a saga. Not Romancing Saga, but

1095
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:48,780
Saga yeah, that's what I think I because honestly it wasn't ever a Final Fantasy. That's great because all the other saga games are shit

1096
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:53,440
No, they're not. Hey, I can't I don't like the saw games at all. I guess I got friends here, too

1097
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:58,700
Sorry, I got three. I don't yes. I got I'm sorry. We're missing saga too, but I think saga 3 2 yeah

1098
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,260
but I

1099
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:06,580
Agree, it was a good entry-level RPG, but honestly it doesn't need to have the Final Fantasy name on it in the u.s

1100
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:10,860
What was the most recent saga game they put out on ps2? Wasn't it like unlimited or something?

1101
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:16,440
Yeah, that game is one of the worst games I've ever played in my life. It's it's awful. No

1102
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,820
The remake of romance Raven's Dolphin ping pals

1103
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:26,860
Gee, oh that was horrible boss that I bought a new copy wrong or I mean

1104
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,420
I feel sorry cuz I know somebody gave it to me as a gift, but it really is a bad game

1105
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:36,620
Play burnout legends on the DS you'll cry. All right. Anyway, um, I gotta let you go rave this off

1106
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:40,340
We got to keep moving on the show. Thank you so much. This is way too long. All right. Appreciate it buddy

1107
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,340
Have a good one. No, he just hung up

1108
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,820
Appreciate the call

1109
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:49,700
Alright, let's do one more call. Hi. You're on Orange Lodge radio. Who's this? It's the one and only legend of Zaku

1110
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,220
Hi legend of Zaku. What's on your mind, buddy? Um

1111
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:59,820
Coney Island just got supernova last Friday. Um, and it started trickle. It started trickle down on the East Coast from what I'm hearing

1112
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,020
So what are your impressions of DDR Supernova after playing it, which I imagine you have?

1113
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:10,380
Um, for one thing, we seem to agree that it might be a beta cab,

1114
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:13,740
because after comparing it to the one in Jersey Gardens, which I happened to play,

1115
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:17,340
which was a location test, there was a lot of differences in it.

1116
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,980
First of all, certain songs were coming in very early.

1117
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:23,820
You know, in other words, there was early timing on songs such as You're Not Here.

1118
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,140
The pads, you know, were really stiff, obviously, because they're brand new.

1119
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:34,440
besides that you know a lot of things that are just you know just the fact

1120
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:39,560
that uh not really I'm trying to think right now it's just we're not sure if

1121
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,280
this is it because you know I this is saying it looks to me like it's the same

1122
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:49,400
build that I played before okay is that good thumbs up thumbs down thumbs middle

1123
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,680
it's all it's so and so I just hope Konami's playing that you know I hope

1124
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,480
Konami's playing the cards right because if this is the final version god help us

1125
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,280
all. Why? Just because of the early timings and stuff? No, it's just because of the fact

1126
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,120
that it's really, you know, it's harder to get perfects now, it's harder to get double

1127
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:10,360
A's, because the timing window is really tight now. Well, I thought people were bitching

1128
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:15,300
that DDR was too easy, all the In the Groove fans were bitching it was too easy. No, but

1129
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:20,120
I think they OD'd on the timing window. At first it started to be too loose, and now

1130
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,120
it's starting to be too tight. I guess it should have been right there in the middle.

1131
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,640
interesting but besides that

1132
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,200
well what's the bit what's been the general because I imagine these arcades

1133
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,160
are packed what's the general fan consensus that you're picking up are

1134
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:36,040
people happy to see a new DDR game back in arcades

1135
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,880
yeah or people bitching on these little nuts

1136
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:42,920
they're not bitching so or so to say they just so

1137
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,920
they really don't know what to believe whether or not they their betas are real

1138
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,600
and the only we're gonna find that out is the second location in New York City

1139
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,720
when it's set up tomorrow

1140
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,120
which is in Chinatown.

1141
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,480
Well, we'll be eagerly awaiting a forum post letting us know.

1142
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,240
Actually, I'm going to link you to one right now.

1143
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,320
I'm going to link you to a thread that actually showed

1144
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,520
the reaction from New Yorkers about the

1145
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,520
supernova setup in Toney Island. And that's in our chat room over at

1146
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,880
orangelaunchradio.com. Click on chat. I don't have time to read it right now

1147
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,120
because we're trying to do a show,

1148
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,700
but I'll check it out later.

1149
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,800
Alright, just keep in mind that Konami is just fooling around with the whole

1150
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,160
the whole release date thing, so I really don't know what to believe right now.

1151
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,880
I don't know whether, as I said, I don't know whether these are betas, or is this the final

1152
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:28,880
thing?

1153
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,880
It's up in the air right now.

1154
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,760
What else are people playing in New York City besides DDR?

1155
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,540
Just hacked in, just stuff like In The Groove and stuff.

1156
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,540
You know, regular...

1157
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:39,000
Is that all people do in New York is dance?

1158
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Huh?

1159
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,520
Is that all people do in New York is dance?

1160
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,900
Nah, but they do other things like, you know, in Chinatown they play fighting games, but

1161
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,160
you know, they have lives to live as well.

1162
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,840
It's something we do on the side.

1163
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,720
Zaco, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.

1164
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,720
Alright.

1165
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,720
Thanks so much for the call.

1166
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,720
Okay.

1167
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,720
Later.

1168
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,720
Bye.

1169
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,720
Bye.

1170
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,720
Oh, I gotta let this call through.

1171
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,720
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1172
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,720
Who's this?

1173
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,720
This is Bandit.

1174
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,720
Hi, Bandit.

1175
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,200
You know, you won points earlier, so I decided to take one more call, because I saw it was

1176
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,200
you.

1177
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,200
What's on your mind?

1178
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,200
Thanks, yeah.

1179
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,200
I appreciate that.

1180
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,200
I think he wasn't giving me points anyways.

1181
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,200
Jerk.

1182
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,200
Alright.

1183
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,200
I'll take him.

1184
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,200
That's his Wii.

1185
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,200
Yeah.

1186
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,200
Alright.

1187
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,200
What's on your mind, buddy?

1188
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,920
He was complaining about the timing window.

1189
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,640
The only thing they did differently is they just made the marvelous timing the perfect

1190
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,640
timing now.

1191
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:31,960
Supposedly from the post I've been reading, that's all they did.

1192
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:38,280
But I mean Bandit, I asked Zaku this and I'll ask you this, weren't most DDR players that

1193
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,840
went over to In the Groove or whatever claiming, and honestly guys just play both and enjoy

1194
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,480
both, but weren't people that went over to In the Groove kind of complaining that the

1195
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,960
The difficulty was too easy on DDR, which is kind of why they wanted a harder game like

1196
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,960
In the Groove.

1197
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,160
And now that Konami's went and made the game harder, they're upset.

1198
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,600
Well, I've argued with so many people about this.

1199
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:03,480
A lot of people went to ITG just because they thought there weren't going to be a new DDR

1200
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,620
coming out.

1201
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:09,040
Then they complained about the difficulty in DDR, or not being hard enough.

1202
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,360
It's not because of the grading, it's because of the actual step charts of the song that

1203
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,340
I keep getting people complaining to me about.

1204
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:18,500
They're always like, oh, this step chart's not hard enough, or this isn't like this and

1205
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,580
that on In the Groove, and they keep comparing it back and forth.

1206
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:28,700
Well, if they got to remember, there wouldn't be any ITG without DDR first.

1207
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,700
That's true.

1208
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,700
That's true.

1209
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:35,740
There are harder step charts in DDR now, so unless they're triple A-ing everything, I

1210
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,740
don't want to hear any complaints.

1211
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:42,220
I don't want to hear any of this stuff again.

1212
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:46,220
Do you live in an area where Supernova is on its way or what?

1213
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,540
I live in Pittsburgh.

1214
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,540
We didn't get one yet.

1215
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,540
It's on its way, though.

1216
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,540
Alright.

1217
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:56,220
Well, Bandit, thanks so much for calling in and giving your perspective on Supernova.

1218
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,220
I appreciate it.

1219
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,220
Alright, man.

1220
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,220
Thanks for the points.

1221
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,540
Well, no problem.

1222
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:05,420
I'm getting razzed for that in the chat room now because apparently I've ruffled the panties

1223
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:09,820
of DMN and he's a little upset now because I was arguing with him whether he should have

1224
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:13,860
points or not and I should I should just keep my big fat opinion out of it and

1225
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:17,380
let him run his contest. Just keep on leeching points for me ya

1226
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:22,660
bastard. Alright Bandit have a good one. Alright you guys do this then. Alright bye.

1227
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:27,740
Yes I realize DMN does not have to be doing a contest I am very grateful he

1228
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:31,060
already knows that but I still have to give him shit because that's what I do

1229
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:34,360
on this program is I give our chatters shit but know that I do that because I

1230
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:40,120
love you very much last minute stories boys and girls anything final you guys

1231
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:44,440
want to bring up actually I do mm-hmm one of my friends on live journal links

1232
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:52,440
this story on Kotaku it was there's a contest going on through July where if

1233
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:58,800
you buy a copy of Tetris during that a time period and register the cereal at

1234
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:05,800
Club Nintendo you can choose to battle Utada Hikaru or get concert tickets.

1235
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:11,800
There's 30 people will be chosen to play against her and 504 pairs of tickets

1236
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:18,440
will be given out. Now the thing is though is that they there's a video of

1237
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:23,960
her playing and it's actually up on YouTube. She completely owns this guy. She

1238
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,720
She plays really really well

1239
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:35,920
You can either see the movie file up on Kotaku or you can check it out do a search on YouTube, but

1240
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:43,180
Yeah, she's really good at Tetris. DMN is putting out a challenge right there. He says I'll fuck up Utada. I

1241
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:50,140
Think that's a Tetris DS challenge in the making right there. Oh sign up. It's on the gauntlet's been thrown down

1242
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:53,800
Utada if you're listening I would love to I would love to play her because

1243
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,280
actually the thing I noticed she plays Tetris the same way I do which is you

1244
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:04,120
know build up for the for the four line and it keeps hopping up you just you

1245
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:08,120
know even them out to where you have the full four lines down it down the next

1246
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:12,840
one that's exactly that's exactly how I play Tetris so that would be very fun I

1247
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:19,840
Now that's a girl gamer. Well done. Anything last minute? Anybody else?

1248
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:35,840
Yeah, there was something interesting I should point out. It was pointed out that 99 Nights, one of the things that happens to be on Microsoft's site, I believe, is showing the product info for 99 Nights.

1249
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,840
And it's interesting because it says hard drive required.

1250
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,840
One of the things that I thought Microsoft was not going to do

1251
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,840
with their games is require you to have a hard drive. And such an anticipated

1252
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,840
game too, ouch. So all of those

1253
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,840
out there that don't have a hard drive, you're kind of fucked.

1254
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,840
Unless this pans out to be just a mistake or something, but that's pretty...

1255
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,840
Well they had that one, was it Football Manager or something like that that required the hard drive.

1256
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,160
I'm thinking this is the way they're going why they're releasing the 256 megabyte card then is beyond me

1257
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,520
Just lower the price of the hard drive or release a larger hard drive

1258
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:17,600
I don't know, but it has hard drive required and hard drive enhanced as two of the things on there

1259
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
So I thought that was interesting

1260
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,240
Who knows

1261
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,000
Interesting anything else last minute you guys

1262
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,400
No

1263
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:36,640
There is another thing also I had Genesis collection is coming to PlayStation 2 and the PSP

1264
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:45,320
It's gonna have a collection of old Genesis games 28 of them and with the additional three being unlocked

1265
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:53,420
Including shinobi to Sonic the Hedgehog golden axe 1 2 & 3 virtual fighter 2 altered beast

1266
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:56,220
echo the dolphin and fancy star

1267
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
rise from your grave

1268
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,920
Alright, well

1269
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,980
then I guess that's gonna do it for tonight's show. We're just about wrapped up here, but

1270
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:09,300
we want to go around first and get everybody's final thought. It's been a long

1271
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,700
second half tonight, but that's alright. It's our birthday. We can go long if we want.

1272
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,760
Loki, I'm sorry, actually Magus, I'll start with you. Thank you very much for being

01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,180
here tonight and contributing.

1274
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:22,020
I know you've been a listener of the show since, when did you start listening?

1275
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:26,140
Almost episode 3. June 03, actually, yeah, episode 3.

1276
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:29,940
Wow, that's hardcore. So thank you. I wasn't even here for episode 3.

1277
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,100

01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,780
Final thought? I got sex appeal because I dual wield.

1281
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:48,620
Nerd. Loki, your final thought? I want to play this game Cinco no Ronde

1282
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:53,640
for the 360. It looks like Einhander. And my final thought is

1283
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,120
head hurts must run ice cube ice cube shampoo would be great right now for my

1284
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,000
