00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Tivo is coming to your PSP and happy birthday to Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.920
Good evening everybody and welcome to

00:34.920 --> 00:39.800
Orange Lounge Radio. It is June 25th, 2006

00:39.800 --> 00:43.760
and you're listening to episode number 188 of our little program.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.760
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye. Joining me as always, say

00:47.760 --> 00:50.440
hello to Dark Sakura. Jamie Summers.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.560
Hi. How you doing? Sleepy.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.800
Yeah, me too. I'm a little exhausted. I'll get into why in a little while though.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.800
But say hello also to LOKI!

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
Hi.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
How you doin'?

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
I'm okay.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
Great.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.800
Also joining us tonight, say hello to our special guest, the 23rd Magus!

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
Yo, what's up?

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
How you doin'?

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
Caffeinated.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
Now you just had a birthday recently.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
Oh yeah, 21st.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.800
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's a big one, it's 21st.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.800
So how did you celebrate the 21st birthday?

01:16.800 --> 01:18.800
Did you go to a bar, get tossed, what?

01:18.800 --> 01:20.800
I had a Guinness one to bed.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
Alright.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
Not much.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
Alright, that's alright.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.800
But I think my 21st birthday was probably about that exciting too, so...

01:26.800 --> 01:28.960
It's all good. No big deal. Alright.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.880
Yeah, it's like you do everything bad and then when you're 21 it's like,

01:31.880 --> 01:32.920
eh, no big deal.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.000
Now I'm actually old enough to be doing this. Now I can do it legally.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.080
Oh, what's the reason to?

01:40.080 --> 01:44.800
Let's go ahead and start this show off. We are here to talk about video games

01:44.800 --> 01:47.720
and gaming news and all that good stuff. And we're going to get into

01:47.720 --> 01:51.240
how is your gaming week. But first, just a couple announcements. First off,

01:51.240 --> 01:56.280
Join our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat if you are listening live here

01:56.280 --> 01:57.740
on this Sunday evening.

01:57.740 --> 01:59.660
You should head on over there and listen.

01:59.660 --> 02:03.380
You can always listen to our program live on orangeloungeradio.com every Sunday night

02:03.380 --> 02:08.960
at 6 o'clock Pacific, or you can listen to us live on All Games Radio, that's allgames.com

02:08.960 --> 02:15.000
every Monday night at 7 p.m. with a couple repeats Tuesday afternoon, but you can't do

02:15.000 --> 02:18.400
chat during then, sorry, because we can only be here live once.

02:18.400 --> 02:25.800
Also, the other announcement I wanted to say was it's our fourth birthday this week, officially.

02:25.800 --> 02:32.600
The first episode of Orange Launch Radio aired June 23rd, 2002, so this is our fourth birthday

02:32.600 --> 02:38.520
show, and so now we're old enough to be potty trained, certainly, and probably be going

02:38.520 --> 02:41.720
to preschool, our little program, so we're very happy.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.720
We're big kids now.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.720
Yes.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.800
Actually, we've probably graduated for the pull-ups.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.800
We've been out of diapers for a little while and probably can read short little books, maybe.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.800
We'll see.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.800
When I was three, I could say condensation.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.800
Oh yeah, well I could say anti-disestablishmentarianism.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.800
No, just kidding.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.800
I could spell it.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.800
Alright, anyway.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.800
We're smart kids.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
We're special.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.800
I was playing Atari 2600 at four, though.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
I remember that.

03:06.800 --> 03:11.800
I was playing the Odyssey 2 at two years old.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
Duck Hunt.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.800
Wow.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.800
Alright, yeah.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
It just goes to show.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
We just dated ourselves.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.800
ourselves how much older we are than him.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.800
I'm the LOBY here, I'm the LOBY.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.800
You need to gain a few more levels.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.800
We're gonna get around to

03:24.800 --> 03:26.800
How Was Your Gaming Week.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.800
We're not doing anything super fancy for our

03:28.800 --> 03:30.800
4th birthday, I mean hooray we're 4, but

03:30.800 --> 03:32.800
we think we're gonna save

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
the guests and

03:34.800 --> 03:36.800
the retrospective and all that

03:36.800 --> 03:38.800
stuff for episode 200, which is coming up

03:38.800 --> 03:40.800
this September, because that's a huge milestone.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.800
200.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.800
Let's go around and do How Was Your Gaming

03:44.800 --> 03:46.560
What kind of video games have you been playing?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.000
Dark Sakura, start us off.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.640
I played a little World of Warcraft pretty much long enough to make a character on a

03:52.640 --> 03:53.640
server with my co-workers.

03:53.640 --> 03:57.480
Yeah, my co-workers play World of Warcraft.

03:57.480 --> 04:04.960
Played some Animal Crossing, holding off getting my copy of Oendon for a little bit just because

04:04.960 --> 04:07.760
stupid stuff getting in the way of my fun.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.840
And I did my tabletop gaming this week.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.280
Yes, I do tabletop gaming.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.000
That's really about it.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Alright.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.840
What kind of tabletop game are you guys playing?

04:19.840 --> 04:20.840
Play werewolf.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.760
Our Buffy game is on hiatus for a season.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.760
Wow.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.520
Not only have you dated yourself this evening, now you've made yourself an obvious nerd.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.520
I don't care.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.520
I mean, come on.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.520
Who plays Buffy roleplay?

04:32.520 --> 04:35.080
You've got to be a hardcore nerd to be doing Buffy roleplay.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.080
Dude, I did...

04:36.080 --> 04:39.080
Okay, you're the one that picked up the GURPS book today.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.080
I was...

04:40.080 --> 04:41.080
I didn't know what it was.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
I was like, what's a GURP?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.080
Is that like a LARP?

04:43.080 --> 04:47.080
My first, actually my second roleplay ever was GURPS.

04:47.080 --> 04:52.080
My third was Shadowrun, my fourth was D&D.

04:52.080 --> 04:58.080
Okay, you have dated yourself. I have definitely not progressed past 3rd edition D&D.

04:58.080 --> 05:04.080
I refused to play 3rd edition. I started on 2nd edition. I still had 1st edition books.

05:04.080 --> 05:09.080
You're not the first person I've heard say something negative about 3rd edition. What's so bad about it?

05:09.080 --> 05:16.040
bad about it everything except for constitution based magic casting i missed stako it made it so

05:16.040 --> 05:24.280
easy all right uh we're gonna go ahead and head on over to loki how was your gaming week it was good

05:24.280 --> 05:31.400
um i don't know really didn't play a whole lot i played more call of duty 2 actually last night

05:31.400 --> 05:35.320
we were trying out the new maps and i finally got on the work i think that they had like another

05:35.320 --> 05:39.680
update or something that allowed those maps that you can purchase or download for free

05:39.680 --> 05:40.680
to work.

05:40.680 --> 05:45.220
And there was one of the maps that had this giant silo on it and you basically climb up

05:45.220 --> 05:47.880
to the top and snipe people down from the top of that.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.360
So that's actually pretty fun to play just that map.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.840
Played a little bit more Blazing Angels trying to beat the damn thing all the way.

05:54.840 --> 06:00.040
I played a little bit of Mutant Storm Reloaded because I'm on level 89 and I have to beat

06:00.040 --> 06:01.040
it.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.700
But then again, all the effort I put into that and I looked at the achievement that

06:04.700 --> 06:08.820
that unlocks and that's like 15 points, I'm like, is it really worth the 15 points?

06:08.820 --> 06:12.420
Well if you're on level 89 at this point you might as well finish it.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.420
It's just, it's, it's...

06:13.420 --> 06:14.420
How many levels are there?

06:14.420 --> 06:16.220
It's like 95 or something, right?

06:16.220 --> 06:17.220
No, 89.

06:17.220 --> 06:21.100
Oh great, so you're on the very last level and you just can't beat it?

06:21.100 --> 06:25.540
Well here's the thing, the difficulty like, it ramps up very strange.

06:25.540 --> 06:30.020
It gets really hard and it kind of gets easier, and it's super duper hard.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.640
So I don't get it.

06:31.640 --> 06:38.280
But I don't know, it's an okay game, I just need to finish it so I can get the damn achievement.

06:38.280 --> 06:44.040
I played Gauntlet for a little bit, and I don't know why.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.040
But yeah, I tried that.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.040
Achievement points!

06:46.040 --> 06:47.040
You want more achievement points?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.840
I think I was looking at your profile, and you don't have any achievement points for

06:49.840 --> 06:53.480
Gauntlet, and I have like 25, therefore I am the better Gauntlet player than you.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.480
Because I haven't played Gauntlet.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
Whatever.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.280
Anyways, what else did I play?

07:00.280 --> 07:06.480
I think it played whack-a-mole. No, it did not play whack-a-mole. I tell you what, it

07:06.480 --> 07:11.360
didn't play. It didn't play point blank DS because freaking GameStop doesn't have it

07:11.360 --> 07:17.760
because they suck. Anyways, I think that was all I played. I didn't really play too much

07:17.760 --> 07:23.400
this week. I've been trying to... Oh, a lot of Test Drive Unlimited demo. A whole lot

07:23.400 --> 07:28.080
of that. We've been trying to see how we can exploit the demo. I keep forgetting to download

07:28.080 --> 07:32.340
It's fun because the cars the police cars are stupid

07:32.340 --> 07:36.560
They downloaded that at arena the week of e3 and I played it like once and it was kind of cool

07:36.560 --> 07:43.000
Like I haven't been excited about a test drive game since like the days of Commodore 64 and this one looks pretty neat

07:43.120 --> 07:47.020
We excited we managed to I was playing it

07:47.020 --> 07:53.720
The Lamborghini goes quite fast off-road ironically enough and the police cannot get you if you're off-road

07:53.720 --> 07:58.720
Then, we took an SUV, we slammed into it, and we knocked it into the ocean.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.240
Well done, you should get points for that.

08:00.240 --> 08:05.120
We knocked it into the ocean, which is supposed to be just like, you know, a few inches deep

08:05.120 --> 08:09.220
when it's washing ashore, but apparently the way the game is designed, it's just a cliff

08:09.220 --> 08:10.800
and the car just disappeared.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.960
And I jumped the fence, and I jumped into this yard that I couldn't get out of, which

08:14.960 --> 08:23.080
was fun, and I also got my car stuck between a rock and a house, and what other fun stuff

08:23.080 --> 08:30.280
do we do oh yeah we jumped a mountain that was fun but the game is very flawed

08:30.280 --> 08:34.560
in but it's I guess it's just a demo right now you know it's obviously not

08:34.560 --> 08:39.080
even near finished but there's a lot of things that got fixed on that a lot a

08:39.080 --> 08:42.900
lot of things but um I don't know we'll see it's this is the game that my boss

08:42.900 --> 08:46.800
says we'll get him to buy an Xbox 360 I'm like you know there's like a lot of

08:46.800 --> 08:53.940
of better games out there why this one but whatever all right my gaming week

08:53.940 --> 08:57.300
was also kind of unexciting I didn't really play a lot of new stuff I played

08:57.300 --> 09:01.060
burnout you know because I there's nothing more fun than doing the synth

09:01.060 --> 09:05.020
pop burnout running through the traffic attack and then once in a while I'll

09:05.020 --> 09:09.580
throw in journey greatest hits or Abba or something like really you know weird

09:09.580 --> 09:15.460
but it's fun to drive to and then I was playing a World of Warcraft still I was

09:15.460 --> 09:20.340
I was on LA for most of the week with a business trip, which reminds me, if you go to All Games

09:20.340 --> 09:24.260
Interactive's show, and I know a lot of you guys listen to them over allgames.com, I'm

09:24.260 --> 09:30.220
on their Tuesday show this week, because I dropped by Arena right after work on Tuesday,

09:30.220 --> 09:34.740
and I was in a really bad mood on Tuesday.

09:34.740 --> 09:39.740
I know what was wrong, I woke up at 3.30 in the morning on Tuesday, so I really beat up

09:39.740 --> 09:43.340
on a couple of their regulars, and I almost felt bad when I listened to the playback of

09:43.340 --> 09:48.120
the show I was like God I was rude it's like going to someone's house and like

09:48.120 --> 09:52.220
drinking all their soda and eating all their food that's kind of what I did on

09:52.220 --> 09:56.160
Tuesday so check it out if you want to see me being a bitch

09:56.160 --> 10:00.500
otherwise as far as new games go I did look at big brain Academy for like five

10:00.500 --> 10:04.240
seconds unfortunately I'll have to wait and give a full review on that next week

10:04.240 --> 10:08.680
however let me talk about a book and you might be thinking wait why would you

10:08.680 --> 10:12.120
talk about a book on a video game show because it has to do with gaming my

10:12.120 --> 10:18.000
My birthday happens to be tomorrow, and Dark Sakura treated me to a Queen for a day, took

10:18.000 --> 10:23.320
me out to lunch, took me out to dessert, and then took me to a bookstore and said, essentially,

10:23.320 --> 10:27.040
in so many words, we're not leaving here until you pick out a book to buy.

10:27.040 --> 10:32.080
So I picked out a book called I Am 8-Bit, which has to do with the 8-bit exhibit that

10:32.080 --> 10:36.960
you see in L.A. every E3, and they have some great art exhibits, and I gotta tell you,

10:36.960 --> 10:43.440
My favorite picture in the I Am 8-Bit book is one where Mario is standing there and he's

10:43.440 --> 10:49.040
looking at the princess, who's lying there naked on the bed, buck-ass naked, and Mario

10:49.040 --> 10:53.440
looks kind of, yeah, it's got a little titty in the book, which makes it, you know, even

10:53.440 --> 10:54.440
better, right?

10:54.440 --> 10:55.440
Some porn?

10:55.440 --> 10:56.440
So, and Mario's...

10:56.440 --> 10:57.440
No, no, no, you said it was erotica.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.120
Yeah, I'm sorry, it was erotica, because Jamie was making fun of me, like, ah, you're buying

11:01.120 --> 11:02.120
porn.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.000
I was like, no, it's erotica.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.140
But Mario's all looking confused, like he doesn't know what to do.

11:07.140 --> 11:10.400
But you see, you know how like sometimes guys, when they don't know what to do, they'll write

11:10.400 --> 11:11.400
notes on their hand?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.680
Like, you know, when they want to break up and don't know what to say, they'll write

11:13.680 --> 11:14.680
it on their hand?

11:14.680 --> 11:18.700
Well, if you look at Mario's hand, what he's looking down at, it has a Konami code on it.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.980
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.260
So frickin' funny.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.420
I'm sorry, that was a great picture.

11:23.420 --> 11:26.020
I'll have to show that to you later, Loki, like during the break, you'd get a kick out

11:26.020 --> 11:27.020
of that.

11:27.020 --> 11:33.560
So I Am 8-Bit is the book, and two thumbs up, I'm sorry, eight thumbs up from me.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.840
a good book a good coffee table book for a gamer all right let's go ahead and get

11:38.840 --> 11:44.880
into some gaming news for this evening by the way if you want to join our chat

11:44.880 --> 11:48.080
room and give some feedback once again it's orange launch radio comm click on

11:48.080 --> 11:53.000
chat and see Wonder Dog Harold says I'm sorry Mario but my dress is in another

11:53.000 --> 11:57.560
castle in reference to the photo I was describing there I was funny that was a

11:57.560 --> 12:02.360
good time by the way one of our chatters DMN is having a little chat room contest

12:02.360 --> 12:07.200
and officially on the record we're not really able to sponsor it but we think

12:07.200 --> 12:08.120
it's cool

12:08.120 --> 12:11.800
DM is actually going to give away a Wii because he has ties to Nintendo so like

12:11.800 --> 12:16.000
to the chatter I think they're playing around the horn and to the chatter that

12:16.000 --> 12:20.280
gets the most points or the average points the best average points wins a Wii

12:20.280 --> 12:23.920
so it just is incentive to participate live in our chat room so if you're not

12:23.920 --> 12:24.680
there

12:24.680 --> 12:29.560
you should be asking yourself why am I not there and we're getting into some

12:29.560 --> 12:33.800
Some gaming news tonight, we are not the only one celebrating a birthday today, actually

12:33.800 --> 12:39.360
Sonic is also celebrating his 15th anniversary and GameTab's getting in on the fun, they're

12:39.360 --> 12:46.160
offering subscribers a trio of titles which are the lock-on versions of Sonic.

12:46.160 --> 12:52.320
For instance, Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles, Knuckles in Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 Sonic and

12:52.320 --> 12:53.320
Knuckles.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.100
Remember how like, you know, you could use the cart and plug it into the old carts and

12:56.100 --> 12:57.100
you have a new game?

12:57.100 --> 12:59.760
That was amazing.

12:59.760 --> 13:04.540
What a cute technology that you never really saw outside of that, at least I don't remember

13:04.540 --> 13:05.540
it.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.380
I liked how you could plug in random Sega games on the cartridge and then you could

13:08.380 --> 13:12.460
do the special stages in different ways with different games.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.460
Really?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.460
I didn't even know you could use it with other games.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.660
You'd have to, I forgot what it was, you had to hold down the buttons while you loaded

13:17.660 --> 13:21.940
the game and it would load up all the special stages on different cartridges.

13:21.940 --> 13:22.940
That's kind of cool.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.340
I like that.

13:24.340 --> 13:28.280
Well anyway, you can download those on GameTap, no plug-in, no cartridges needed, all that

13:28.280 --> 13:30.660
good stuff if you're a GameTap member.

13:30.660 --> 13:38.300
Also, they added on to GameTap TV three behind-the-scenes looks at Sonic the Hedgehog, so if you like

13:38.300 --> 13:43.860
to watch that stuff that GameTap TV produces, which is far better than anything G4 is producing

13:43.860 --> 13:46.820
currently, check it out.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.580
It's a good time.

13:48.580 --> 13:52.920
Also, just to join in on the fun here, Sega has revealed that they're going to be doing

13:52.920 --> 13:58.420
two new portable Sonic games, and there's a first look at those screens there.

13:58.420 --> 14:03.780
What they're basically doing is that they're going to do Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis for

14:03.780 --> 14:10.580
the Game Boy Advance, and it's going to have additions to Sonic the Hedgehog, but it will

14:10.580 --> 14:15.100
have Sonic Spin Dash, and it's also going to have a save ability.

14:15.100 --> 14:20.100
Also coming out on the PSP, Sonic Rivals, which is a one-on-one racing game that will

14:20.100 --> 14:24.900
have knuckles and it's gonna have like kind of like a 2d combined with a 3d

14:24.900 --> 14:28.980
world type thing I played the hell out of that at e3 oh what you think oh it's

14:28.980 --> 14:35.300
so good and I won all the time and they gave me a t-shirt but it really is it's

14:35.300 --> 14:40.900
almost like playing you know old-school Sonic with updated graphics but instead

14:40.900 --> 14:44.660
your goal is just to make it through the level as fast as humanly possible it's

14:44.660 --> 14:56.660
It's like doing the old Tails races in Sonic Adventure, just on 2D.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.660
Did you play it at all?

14:57.660 --> 14:58.660
You did?

14:58.660 --> 14:59.660
No, I didn't.

14:59.660 --> 15:03.900
Oh, it's definitely one that I would suggest to everyone to get out.

15:03.900 --> 15:08.940
We had a lot of game purchases go on lately.

15:08.940 --> 15:15.300
Mario cut a half a million copies in the u.s. And over one month just over a month

15:16.340 --> 15:18.980
They're saying basically 20 copies were sold every minute

15:19.560 --> 15:25.160
Which I think they did the math and that didn't end up being correct, but you know, it's a lot

15:25.300 --> 15:31.060
Well in the first two days they sold a hundred and thirty six thousand five hundred units. Wow, so

15:31.780 --> 15:33.780
basically, that's just

15:33.780 --> 15:37.780
pretty, pretty, you know, hardcore for game sales.

15:37.780 --> 15:41.280
Half a million, you said? Half a million, five hundred thousand.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.280
That's pretty darn good for a game that really hasn't been out that long, all things considered, yeah.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.780
It's at the top of the charts. Yeah, absolutely. So it's having the same...

15:48.780 --> 15:51.780
The rated E games are taking over.

15:51.780 --> 15:57.780
It's having the same non-stop hysteria-ness here that it's been having in Japan, essentially.

15:57.780 --> 16:01.780
This goes to show that old school will win you points for the masses.

16:01.780 --> 16:05.940
especially when it comes to Nintendo. You know, I don't know

16:05.940 --> 16:10.660
if Sony were to release a new Crash Bandicoot for the PSP

16:10.660 --> 16:13.740
I don't know if it would have the same...yeah I don't know...because

16:13.740 --> 16:16.980
Crash Bandicoot they've really beaten into the ground but isn't that weird that we

16:16.980 --> 16:18.860
feel burnt out on Crash Bandicoot

16:18.860 --> 16:24.420
yet Nintendo has way horrid Mario more often. They don't need to deviate from the

16:24.420 --> 16:25.860
formula because it works.

16:25.860 --> 16:30.100
The other thing too is Crash Bandicoot is in the first party

16:30.100 --> 16:34.620
Okay, I don't know. I tried to think of like a Sony mascot. That's the best thing I can come up with

16:34.620 --> 16:40.860
Well, that's because it was you know at one point, you know their mascot because that's all they really had and now it's not

16:40.860 --> 16:43.460
They don't really have a mascot they have you know

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
giant crabs, I guess

16:47.140 --> 16:49.140
giant crabs could be the mascot I

16:51.220 --> 16:53.220
Don't know

16:53.220 --> 16:54.420
Rhinos in Africa.

17:23.220 --> 17:31.060
saying that original hits like Geometry Wars and Smash TV and casual games would extend

17:31.060 --> 17:36.540
the 360's appeal to non-hardcore audiences and also those people that, and I don't know

17:36.540 --> 17:41.100
why people don't have broadband yet, but the people that don't have broadband can't download

17:41.100 --> 17:50.020
them. But, ironically enough, information arrived to me this week saying that actually

17:50.020 --> 17:52.900
Hopefully this is going to be happening sooner than later.

17:52.900 --> 17:59.120
There is going to be a game coming out in September called the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged.

17:59.120 --> 18:04.440
And what it's going to contain is a few games, including Geometry Wars, Texas Hold'em, which

18:04.440 --> 18:10.980
is supposed to be coming out in July I think, Wick, Bejeweled 2, Outpost's Cloaky X, Hardwood

18:10.980 --> 18:14.420
Backgammon, which I don't believe is out yet.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.740
No, Backgammon is on the marketplace, I'm pretty sure.

18:16.740 --> 18:17.740
Oh, it is?

18:17.740 --> 18:18.740
Yeah.

18:18.740 --> 18:19.740
No, I wouldn't play it anyway.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.900
are like the hardwood games or whatever.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.660
Free, which will also come with a free month of gold, which they include with like almost

18:26.660 --> 18:30.500
every game nowadays, and a hundred free Microsoft points.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
And that's...

18:31.500 --> 18:34.940
So you can download some crappy icons, because that's about what a hundred points will buy

18:34.940 --> 18:35.940
you, is crappy icons.

18:35.940 --> 18:36.940
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

18:36.940 --> 18:42.240
But that's coming, and it's supposed to retail for about $39.99 for the whole package.

18:42.240 --> 18:49.900
So that's pretty sweet if you don't have access to broadband and live and stuff and other

18:49.900 --> 18:51.080
than that, I don't know.

18:51.080 --> 18:56.040
I could see them doing this later on and stuff with maybe some more games and stuff.

18:56.040 --> 19:00.680
Now you said the information came to you, how did you get this?

19:00.680 --> 19:04.400
Anonymous tip or were you listening in a top secret board meeting?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.400
No.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.640
Because I saw on Joystiq when they ran the article, I saw that there was a little addendum

19:09.640 --> 19:11.240
and they said, thanks for the tip, Loki.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.920
And I'm like, what the hell?

19:12.920 --> 19:14.480
What is Loki doing?

19:14.480 --> 19:15.880
Because it was you.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.040
And I'm like, what the hell?

19:17.040 --> 19:19.400
So where did you get this information from?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.120
This was for my work.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.000
This is straight from Microsoft, by the way.

19:23.000 --> 19:23.500
Wow.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.600
Because they gave us information on a ton of things.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.280
We'll see if they give you any more information, loud mouth.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.880
They gave it to all the retailers.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.860
It's just that you don't have people

19:32.860 --> 19:35.720
that work in the press and retail at the same time.

19:35.720 --> 19:36.440
Except for you.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.000
Except for me.

19:37.000 --> 19:37.600
All right.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.240
Interesting.

19:39.240 --> 19:43.280
I look every day at least like four or five times a day for new

19:43.280 --> 19:44.400
information

19:44.400 --> 19:45.600
I am

19:45.600 --> 19:49.080
That surprises me that the mainstream gaming press doesn't have their nose in

19:49.080 --> 19:50.500
retail somehow

19:50.500 --> 19:51.840
Well they do, they watch their

19:51.840 --> 19:56.540
Best Buy release dates and how awful that crap

19:56.540 --> 19:58.200
Interesting, that's so interesting

19:58.200 --> 20:01.560
Well also Xbox Live, one thing they're definitely looking forward to over on

20:01.560 --> 20:03.400
Xbox Live is Luminous

20:03.400 --> 20:06.040
What's interesting about this though, you know we've talked a little bit about

20:06.040 --> 20:09.260
about luminous now it's supposed to be one of the more expensive Xbox Live

20:09.260 --> 20:13.300
arcade games is gonna go for 1200 Microsoft points or $15 get this

20:13.300 --> 20:20.840
supposedly it's not going to have Xbox Live multiplayer on it by default what's

20:20.840 --> 20:25.360
going on is Tetsuya Mitsugishi who you know created the game he actually

20:25.360 --> 20:29.920
detailed some plans where he's saying that the multiplayer support is going to

20:29.920 --> 20:36.200
be an add-on that's separately viable now they have not finalized the decision

20:36.200 --> 20:41.000
on that but that's basically saying that okay even though you spend $15 on the

20:41.000 --> 20:44.680
game it's not going to be multiplayer unless you spend a little more money by

20:44.680 --> 20:49.720
the way also you're gonna have to do license music backgrounds that's all

20:49.720 --> 20:55.640
gonna be premium downloads as well so interesting comparisons been made where

20:55.640 --> 21:00.360
If you think about it, Luminous, when it first came out on the PSP, was $40.

21:00.360 --> 21:05.800
So this makes this whole Luminous Live thing look like a real deal, but come to think of

21:05.800 --> 21:11.880
it, now you can get Luminous for $19.99 on the PSP, so is this going to end up really

21:11.880 --> 21:12.880
being a deal?

21:12.880 --> 21:13.880
I don't know.

21:13.880 --> 21:14.880
How bad do you want Luminous on your TV?

21:14.880 --> 21:17.080
I think it's just stupid.

21:17.080 --> 21:22.360
I can understand it because I don't know how many people played Luminous multiplayer, and

21:22.360 --> 21:27.520
I don't know if it's really going to add anything to it, but the fact that you're really trying

21:27.520 --> 21:31.840
to charge extra for it, I don't like it just because other companies are going to get the

21:31.840 --> 21:32.840
same idea.

21:32.840 --> 21:39.060
You know, oh we can cripple our games when we send them out and charge you extra to add

21:39.060 --> 21:40.440
the features that you want.

21:40.440 --> 21:45.420
You don't have to have two player, you know, but we're going to make you buy it.

21:45.420 --> 21:48.420
So I don't like that kind of thinking.

21:48.420 --> 21:51.780
The only reason why I'm not super pissed off about this, and I think a lot of people have

21:51.780 --> 21:53.660
and saying, oh, this is an outrage.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.420
This is too much to be charging for an arcade title.

21:56.420 --> 21:59.420
I kind of think, you know, if the creators of this game

21:59.420 --> 22:02.140
wanted to, they could probably get away

22:02.140 --> 22:05.420
with releasing this as an over-the-counter title

22:05.420 --> 22:09.500
in the nice little clamshell and everything for $39.99.

22:09.500 --> 22:13.240
You know, they release these games all the time,

22:13.240 --> 22:16.020
especially early on in a console's life period,

22:16.020 --> 22:18.540
where the game takes up very little space on the disk.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.180
Think about the first PlayStation 2 games.

22:20.180 --> 22:21.420
They were all on CD.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.320
They barely took up any space at all.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.880
So if the creators of this game wanted to,

22:24.880 --> 22:26.400
they didn't have to sell it on arcade.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.680
They probably could have done a in-store release

22:28.680 --> 22:30.480
for 40 bucks and gotten away with it.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.440
I'll bet you anything they do that, too.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.880
Just like, now we're seeing it with, you know,

22:34.880 --> 22:36.480
the thing you were talking about

22:36.480 --> 22:39.120
where they have the arcade titles coming out for retail

22:39.120 --> 22:41.000
for those folks who aren't plugged in.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.040
I'll bet you anything Luminous does come out that way

22:43.040 --> 22:46.960
as well, but, and only kinda when I put it in that light

22:46.960 --> 22:48.720
where it's, well, at least you're not paying 40 bucks

22:48.720 --> 22:51.240
for the clamshell, am I not pissed off about this.

22:51.240 --> 22:56.320
Then you also get the games like Call of Duty 2 that release the game of your edition which

22:56.320 --> 23:01.960
just basically has the game and the downloadable content for it on there.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.440
And then they re-skew it as something new.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.840
So, I don't know.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.840
It's kind of an interesting way of selling things.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.280
Going to our chat room at OrangeLionTrader.com, click on chat.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.320
FunnyDale says, so what are you telling me?

23:15.320 --> 23:20.000
Is that a game that costs 20 bucks on the PSP is going to cost me $200 to play the full

23:20.000 --> 23:25.040
version on Xbox Live, well I don't know about 200, that might be a little extreme, but by

23:25.040 --> 23:31.040
the time all these micropayments and multiplayer and extra skins and stuff add up, yeah, you're

23:31.040 --> 23:35.640
probably looking at about $40, which is what the original game would have cost you on the

23:35.640 --> 23:36.640
PSP.

23:36.640 --> 23:41.520
But again, I kind of go back to that scenario, you know, they could get away with...

23:41.520 --> 23:45.200
If they had never said this was going to be on arcade, if they just said Luminous is coming

23:45.200 --> 23:50.240
out for the Xbox 360. I don't think people would have batted an eye at a $40 price tag

23:50.240 --> 23:52.440
for it, because that's what all the other games cost.

23:52.440 --> 23:56.420
But the thing is, and I would still be kinda pissed off about it, is that they didn't really

23:56.420 --> 24:02.360
do anything with the graphics and stuff. It's not improved in any way. It's just a port.

24:02.360 --> 24:08.700
From what we saw of Luminous 2 at E3, not a damn thing's changed there either. So I

24:08.700 --> 24:13.280
don't know if that was just an early announcement build or something, I hope so, because that

24:13.280 --> 24:15.240
That would be very disappointing.

24:15.240 --> 24:21.920
Luminous is a fantastic game, and I hope they're not going to screw the series by milking it

24:21.920 --> 24:27.880
without giving us something new with it, because that's kind of what happened with Tetris.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.800
That's why Tetris kind of went downhill for a long time.

24:30.800 --> 24:35.920
I mean, granted, it's had a resurgence a couple times, Tetris DS being the latest one, but

24:35.920 --> 24:38.960
there was a while there where we were just all burned out on Tetris, right?

24:38.960 --> 24:43.240
You kind of see Tetris on the shelf, you go, oh goody, another Tetris clone, right?

24:43.240 --> 24:50.720
Yeah, well speaking of live games, the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged wasn't the only thing

24:50.720 --> 24:52.280
that I heard about that was coming out.

24:52.280 --> 24:57.560
We actually got updates on all of the Xbox 360 accessories that are going to be coming

24:57.560 --> 25:03.240
out including Xbox Live Vision, which we now have a date, which is supposed to be September

25:03.240 --> 25:06.640
20th around there, you know it shouldn't change too much.

25:06.640 --> 25:13.220
I can confirm though it is going to be coming with UNO bundled in there as well as yet again

25:13.220 --> 25:18.800
a one month trial to Xbox Live Gold and a headset is going to be packaged with that

25:18.800 --> 25:19.800
as well.

25:19.800 --> 25:24.220
So you will be getting the nice little camera and all that other fun stuff.

25:24.220 --> 25:29.680
What's also cool is the camera can work with your PC which I think is really neat also.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.040
No price yet on that though.

25:32.040 --> 25:38.740
Also going to be coming out in November on the 15th so far is the 256 megabyte memory

25:38.740 --> 25:45.180
unit. No price on that yet either but of course for the price of it you might as well just

25:45.180 --> 25:49.900
buy a hard drive to be honest. It's probably going to be about 50 bucks I'm thinking. And

25:49.900 --> 25:56.060
then of course also around the same time we have the wireless headset which is also coming

25:56.060 --> 26:02.300
out in November and that should be pretty cool as well. At least hopefully it will sound

26:02.300 --> 26:09.900
better than the current headset that they have for the Xbox 360. And I also know that

26:09.900 --> 26:19.140
the HD DVD player is supposed to be coming out around that same time too. So, good stuff.

26:19.140 --> 26:23.780
Going to our chat room, orangeonshooter.com, click on chat. GK128 says, Bastards already

26:23.780 --> 26:29.820
bought Uno. I'm sure that's the way most of us feel. What do we get if we already have

26:29.820 --> 26:31.820
Are they going to give us some points or is it just screw you?

26:31.820 --> 26:33.820
They should just give us Microsoft points.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.820
I think it's just going to be a sucker.

26:35.820 --> 26:40.820
You got to play for all these months before the game came out on shelves.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.820
I'm surprised they don't sell the live arcade games in stores.

26:43.820 --> 26:50.820
Because all they are, for example when I bought my live, the 12 month kit that came with the headset.

26:50.820 --> 26:53.820
Because I bought a core system and I didn't have a headset.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.820
Which I never really used the headset either.

26:56.820 --> 27:00.700
But it came with Bank Shot Billiards 2

27:00.700 --> 27:04.500
and it was just one of those cards that you pull the tab off and it has a code on it and you

27:04.500 --> 27:05.780
redeem it for a game.

27:05.780 --> 27:09.660
I'm surprised they don't sell those at the store.

27:09.660 --> 27:13.580
My all thought was that the reason why they did it that way is because they're

27:13.580 --> 27:17.700
bypassing retail when they sell it on Xbox Live Arcade and that's how they can

27:17.700 --> 27:20.780
get away with doing it so cheap. I mean five bucks for Geometry Wars.

27:20.780 --> 27:24.140
That's a freaking steal. You know if they had released that game through a

27:24.140 --> 27:25.420
retailer

27:25.420 --> 27:29.740
you would have had so many people to go through that want a bite of the money

27:29.740 --> 27:31.020
coming from the consumer

27:31.020 --> 27:34.340
they would not be able to sell that game for five dollars. It would have been at least

27:34.340 --> 27:39.100
twenty, if not more. So that's kind of why I always felt that

27:39.100 --> 27:43.200
Xbox Live Arcade kind of existed, was for them to sell the games

27:43.200 --> 27:46.460
directly. You know, I'm surprised that they are packaging with Uno, to be honest.

27:46.460 --> 27:50.020
I don't think that's really a game that would benefit from the camera.

27:50.020 --> 27:53.900
I think with cutting out the middleman, like you said,

27:53.900 --> 27:57.420
with Xbox Live downloadable games, I think they're

27:57.420 --> 28:00.660
kind of taking a hint from Valve and the releases

28:00.660 --> 28:04.100
of various games, Half-Life 2,

28:04.100 --> 28:08.900
Sin episodes, Darwinia, things like that. Downloadable content, they can offer it

28:08.900 --> 28:09.700
for cheaper,

28:09.700 --> 28:13.300
and in some cases a lot easier than just

28:13.300 --> 28:19.020
going to the store.

28:19.020 --> 28:24.620
Anyway, also something that could be coming out for the 360, we don't know if this is

28:24.620 --> 28:29.980
going to be for sure yet, however, this is kind of interesting, apparently Peter Moore

28:29.980 --> 28:33.380
recently gave an interview on another podcast, we've talked about these guys before, they're

28:33.380 --> 28:38.460
pretty cool, Gamertag Radio, they snagged Peter Moore, lucky guys, well Peter Moore

28:38.460 --> 28:44.780
was on that station, he was saying that shoulder buttons, triggers, analog sticks, D-pads,

28:44.780 --> 28:50.220
There's a lot going on when you compare it to an Atari 2600 button and stick.

28:50.220 --> 28:56.180
So basically what he's saying is that, you know, he's imagining that he's kind of insinuating

28:56.180 --> 29:00.840
that they're going to be doing a simpler controller, basically with the Xbox Live Arcade downloads

29:00.840 --> 29:04.780
in mind, because if you think about a lot of those Xbox Live Arcade downloads, UNO,

29:04.780 --> 29:09.700
Geometry Wars, you don't really use a lot of the buttons on the Xbox 360 controller.

29:09.700 --> 29:13.660
They could get away with releasing a controller with one or two buttons, and most of the games

29:13.660 --> 29:19.180
would support that there. So, now nothing is being confirmed by Microsoft directly,

29:19.180 --> 29:22.900
but they're basically saying that, yeah, we're going to continue to innovate wherever we

29:22.900 --> 29:26.040
can. But still, it's kind of interesting when Peter Moore says this, you know he's in the

29:26.040 --> 29:28.260
know of what's going on at Microsoft.

29:28.260 --> 29:29.260
That's so stupid.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.340
What do you think? Why?

29:31.340 --> 29:35.180
If you're buying a 360, you obviously know how to use a controller anyways. What the

29:35.180 --> 29:38.560
hell? I mean, all the other games you're playing use the entire controller. I think you should

29:38.560 --> 29:42.460
be familiar enough with it to all of a sudden become retarded when you start playing an

29:42.460 --> 29:48.340
Xbox live arcade game and don't tell me you're just buying the system to play those live arcade games because that's even more retarded

29:48.340 --> 29:52.000
Well, what about the whole trying to make the system accessible like, you know

29:52.000 --> 29:58.020
To people who aren't the hardcore gamers because I know quite a few people probably think the idea of playing Uno

29:58.020 --> 30:03.040
It's kind of cool that aren't the hardcore gamers. Are they going to be buying a 360 to play Uno?

30:03.320 --> 30:08.940
Please don't tell me that they're actually gonna go spend $400 on a system to play Uno

30:08.940 --> 30:09.940
Uno!

30:09.940 --> 30:16.180
Also, if they need something so simple, they can just go to, you know, Wal-Mart and buy

30:16.180 --> 30:17.720
a Uno deck.

30:17.720 --> 30:22.140
And the other thing, too, is they don't have to use the analog, since that's way too complex,

30:22.140 --> 30:24.680
you know, using an analog nub on there.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.980
You know, in most of the games, anyways, there are about one or two buttons.

30:27.980 --> 30:30.600
It's not like they have to remember which button they have to push.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.580
What about in trying to justify it as a family purchase?

30:33.580 --> 30:40.260
You know, the kid, let's say the 17-year-old male who really wants the system for the household

30:40.260 --> 30:44.200
is trying to tell mom and dad, you know, all the good reasons is like, hey, you guys could

30:44.200 --> 30:46.200
even play Uno on it if you wanted to.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.840
Even though, you know, that's not really what the system is going to be mainly for.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.280
It's going to be for the gamer.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.640
It's got that accessibility and again that whole, you know, because what are these next

30:55.640 --> 30:56.640
gen systems trying to be?

30:56.640 --> 30:59.720
They're trying to be the living room centerpiece, right?

30:59.720 --> 31:01.160
That has to be accessible to everybody.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.800
I still think it's unnecessary.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.360
I understand it with the Wii, being the way that the Wii controller is, it doesn't have

31:06.360 --> 31:08.260
that many buttons on it anyways.

31:08.260 --> 31:12.880
It's got like a directional pad and a couple, you know, buttons on it, so you can't really

31:12.880 --> 31:18.100
play any, you know, the games that are on there with that controller.

31:18.100 --> 31:21.500
So you do need something extra to, you know, be able to play those games.

31:21.500 --> 31:25.700
But the live games right now, and especially, what if the live games become more complex

31:25.700 --> 31:27.620
later on, and are gonna need more buttons?

31:27.620 --> 31:32.620
I still think it's ridiculous to expect someone to go out and buy another controller just

31:32.620 --> 31:36.860
do exactly what this normal controller can do it's like wow here i can go spend more money on a

31:36.860 --> 31:41.420
controller that can't do what the normal controller can do and i can tell you this much buying

31:41.420 --> 31:46.940
accessories for a 360 it's expensive as it is each one of those controllers is about 50 bucks

31:46.940 --> 31:52.060
you know what i think you should be fine with just the one controller okay again devil's advocate

31:52.060 --> 31:59.100
what why then do they sell dvd remotes separately for like playstation 2 you don't need it okay

31:59.100 --> 32:02.400
Well the reason why they sell those separately is sometimes those DVD remotes have

32:02.400 --> 32:05.640
features that you can't normally do like angle change and all that stuff.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.500
Normally you can pull it up all that on the PlayStation, you just have to know your way around the menus.

32:09.500 --> 32:14.900
Yes, you can do it through menus but why bother doing it through menus when you have dedicated buttons for that?

32:14.900 --> 32:17.700
That's not to say, you know, the convenience of the consumer.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.300
Yes, it is for the convenience but here's the thing though,

32:20.300 --> 32:23.400
is it's still convenient to use the same buttons on there.

32:23.400 --> 32:27.800
They have triggers and analog sticks. I mean, how hard is it? It's not like I can't

32:27.800 --> 32:30.600
figure out the buttons, it's pretty simplified.

32:30.600 --> 32:35.000
Alright, well we welcome your feedback on this issue.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.720
You can always send us an email. It's mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com

32:38.720 --> 32:42.320
or we'll open up the skype line a little later on in the program.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.080
Well I suppose they can, you know, save some money, you know,

32:46.080 --> 32:49.960
especially since, you know, the 360 is supposedly gonna, well the rumor is going

32:49.960 --> 32:51.240
around that it's supposed to drop

32:51.240 --> 32:54.280
in price around Christmas and I think that's a big

32:54.280 --> 33:00.680
a bunch of crap, if you ask me. Basically, you know, this has been going back and forth,

33:00.680 --> 33:04.440
you know, people saying, oh yeah, it's gonna drop, you know, we heard it from such and such person,

33:05.720 --> 33:09.320
that's gonna drop $100 to make it look, you know, more enticing for the people, you know,

33:09.320 --> 33:14.440
not to buy the Wii and stuff. But then again, at the same time, you know, why do they need to drop

33:14.440 --> 33:18.520
the price when the PS3 is, you know, $600? I don't think it's gonna drop, and if I remember

33:18.520 --> 33:21.720
correctly, I think Peter Moore actually said, no, they're not dropping the price of the system.

33:21.720 --> 33:28.600
them. Who's saying that the price is going to drop? Is it just internet rumor? A source

33:28.600 --> 33:34.600
close to Microsoft. So, Joe Nobody, you know, basically saying that it's going to drop.

33:34.600 --> 33:39.440
A friend of a friend's cousin's, you know, brother's, uncle's. Yeah, who probably works

33:39.440 --> 33:46.040
in the help center and is an expert on everything, you know, and so, I don't think it's going

33:46.040 --> 33:50.880
to drop. I actually see a small price cut reasonable. I don't think like a hundred bucks,

33:50.880 --> 33:55.360
but I could see like maybe they throw in a game like a cheapy game or they

33:55.360 --> 33:56.160
throw in

33:56.160 --> 34:00.520
yeah like a or they cut it by 20, 40 maybe 50 dollars

34:00.520 --> 34:04.120
that seems a lot more possible especially around the holidays. That seems feasible like Forza 2

34:04.120 --> 34:08.920
and the 360 I could see that happening that makes more sense because

34:08.920 --> 34:11.840
you know you spend the money on the game system you want to have something to

34:11.840 --> 34:12.400
play

34:12.400 --> 34:17.120
on Christmas morning there that that makes more sense than dropping the price

34:17.120 --> 34:20.320
of the system a hundred bucks cause I don't think that's gonna happen

34:20.320 --> 34:23.880
Going over to our chat room, jaded2006 says,

34:23.880 --> 34:28.220
I laugh, someone actually named Joe Nobody is listening.

34:28.220 --> 34:32.420
I guess maybe there's somebody he knows who's actually named Joe Nobody.

34:32.420 --> 34:33.100
Good job, Loki.

34:33.100 --> 34:36.900
JeremyTod1 says, if the Wii launches at $250,

34:36.900 --> 34:41.620
then the $360 price will drop to $250 and $350. He seems pretty convinced that

34:41.620 --> 34:44.820
that drop would happen to be competitive with the Wii.

34:44.820 --> 34:48.260
And then, let's see, Hitstun has a question. By the way, how much is an

34:48.260 --> 34:54.460
original Xbox now is it still $1.99 I don't think they aren't they $1.79

34:54.460 --> 34:58.460
they're cheaper than that I think it's like around $1.50 if not I know it's

34:58.460 --> 35:02.700
supposed to drop to $99 I could see them doing that to compete with like the

35:02.700 --> 35:06.140
PlayStation 2 I will research very quickly here while we move on to some

35:06.140 --> 35:09.140
other stories but yeah well there is something you can do with the money that

35:09.140 --> 35:14.220
you're saving on an Xbox 360 if they do drop the price hmm what's that buy porn

35:14.220 --> 35:20.540
well yeah that too but you know you can spend a $25,000 on a Gameboy oh yeah

35:20.540 --> 35:24.060
that's just chump change for me I just have that lying around you know we did

35:24.060 --> 35:28.740
see what the $10,000 sushi that's why when you and I went to sushi today they

35:28.740 --> 35:32.820
had the sushi roll for $10,000 and it had like real gold flakes on it and real

35:32.820 --> 35:37.860
gold flakes on it in a two carat diamond you can't eat it to get the menu I saw

35:37.860 --> 35:42.180
it was in the menu and all kinds of expensive caviar $10,000 sushi roll

35:42.180 --> 35:48.740
Listen to me. They had they had that next to the 99 cent air roll, which was has nothing in it. It was just rice

35:51.060 --> 35:53.180
The sushi place was crazy

35:55.380 --> 35:59.820
$100,000, you know what now I know it's restaurant. I'm gonna knock off if I'm gonna go

36:00.820 --> 36:04.500
Wow, this restaurant carries diamonds. I'm going there. I

36:05.460 --> 36:11.140
Think if you complain if you if you get it for free, all right, so basically you have this equivalent of Game Boys

36:11.140 --> 36:15.500
Yeah, there's a $25,000 Game Boy put out by Swiss Supply Direct

36:16.060 --> 36:20.140
That figures the Swiss would come on something crazy like this. Hey, it's my turn

36:21.180 --> 36:23.900
You know, we might have listeners there you jackass

36:25.740 --> 36:29.620
Anyway, it has a diamond set on the display screen it has

36:30.940 --> 36:33.300
diamond off on buttons it has

36:33.300 --> 36:40.580
has the original cables, extra game cartridges, a blue leather display case. It's made out

36:40.580 --> 36:45.380
of solid 18 karat gold. The question is, does it have a knife and a

36:45.380 --> 36:51.540
corkscrew in it as well? I think so, you know, but it weighs 27 ounces.

36:51.540 --> 36:56.980
It's supposed to be, you know, the price is supposed to be just like right on, you know,

36:56.980 --> 37:01.660
cost of material and sale. But the thing is, is that it's not even like

37:01.660 --> 37:06.380
a cool gameboy it's like an old gameboy it's not even a fucking DS or a GBA or a

37:06.380 --> 37:12.460
micro it's a gameboy it's a game brick yeah they just do like a gameboy micro

37:12.460 --> 37:17.380
they would have spent less money on it and then it sort of trendy it should

37:17.380 --> 37:20.980
have come with a knife and corkscrew for me to stab myself with when I realized

37:20.980 --> 37:26.860
I spent $25,000 on a piece of shit the way that this looks is that I could

37:26.860 --> 37:31.140
easily go to like the craft store and get contact paper and those little

37:31.140 --> 37:35.140
model jewels and bling went up myself if I felt so inclined but personally I

37:35.140 --> 37:38.640
think that blinged up equipment is really retarded looking. Didn't they have

37:38.640 --> 37:42.260
like something like that for like little girls to do the jeans and stuff where you

37:42.260 --> 37:48.700
like glue on like fake plastic gems and sparkles? As I said really retarded. Why

37:48.700 --> 37:52.220
why wouldn't I be surprised to see Paris Hilton toting around something like this

37:52.220 --> 37:58.260
though I mean. Because Paris Hilton has money to spend and no brain to make

37:58.260 --> 37:59.260
decisions with.

37:59.260 --> 38:06.280
Hey guys, you should play my new game Diamond Quest, it's going to be on my $25,000 Swiss

38:06.280 --> 38:07.280
Game Wine.

38:07.280 --> 38:11.500
You saw that they renamed that game to Diamond Quest so that she didn't look like a complete

38:11.500 --> 38:12.500
idiot.

38:12.500 --> 38:16.340
They should rename it to Stupid Spoiled Horror's Game.

38:16.340 --> 38:20.180
Stupid Spoiled Horror the Game.

38:20.180 --> 38:21.180
God I hate her.

38:21.180 --> 38:22.180
Anyway.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.180
Anyway.

38:23.180 --> 38:27.260
Sorry, we do that once in a while, the four years of Orange Lounge Radio, we've actually

38:27.260 --> 38:30.360
slipped into Paris Hilton's chat a couple of times. I don't know why it keeps coming

38:30.360 --> 38:37.100
back to her. Okay, I can't go way off topic here again. I can't help it, but I've actually

38:37.100 --> 38:44.700
caught some of the third season of The Simple Life, Yale to death doing part, and that show

38:44.700 --> 38:50.860
is basically like, if I were the husband in any one of those situations, I would be getting

38:50.860 --> 38:55.820
my ass handed to me because they get them in so much trouble and then their wives basically

38:55.820 --> 39:00.380
just rip into them. It's like basically... Excuse me, I have a question. Is this a video

39:00.380 --> 39:08.820
game? Yes. I'm getting to that. Fine. No, actually I'm not. But, okay, completely off

39:08.820 --> 39:14.440
topic there. They kind of talked about something that we talked about last week. Louisiana

39:14.440 --> 39:19.180
and their game laws. Basically the one where they were going to be, you know, finding the

39:19.180 --> 39:24.340
hell out of retailers for selling indecent stuff. Well, a couple things have happened.

39:24.340 --> 39:32.120
First off, judges actually gotten the law temporarily blocked and basically of course

39:32.120 --> 39:39.800
this is all the ESA is doing as far as being able to turn this over.

39:39.800 --> 39:46.640
The ESA and EMA have filed suit last Friday to overturn the law and according to the court

39:46.640 --> 39:54.160
filings later that day, a federal judge, James J. Brady, granted the trade group's request

39:54.160 --> 39:58.520
for a temporary restraining order preventing the law from being enforced.

39:58.520 --> 40:06.680
And basically the three reasons why they, you know, it's very controversial and goes

40:06.680 --> 40:12.060
against a lot of the First Amendment and I think it goes to the Fourteenth Amendment

40:12.060 --> 40:17.540
of the Constitution, and basically the ESA's comment on this was, not only does the Act

40:17.540 --> 40:24.060
directly restrict the decimation and receipt of considerable amount of fully protected

40:24.060 --> 40:31.620
expression, but because of its numerous vague terms, the Act also creates a chilling effect

40:31.620 --> 40:36.860
on a great deal of speech as video game creators, publishers, manufacturers, distributors and

40:36.860 --> 40:42.020
retailers will respond to the Act's uncertainty by self-censoring, depriving both adults and

40:42.020 --> 40:49.220
children access of undeniably protected expression. Basically what they're saying is, you know,

40:49.220 --> 40:54.460
what exactly is obscene, you know, there's nothing really defining it in this and also,

40:54.460 --> 40:59.380
you know, because of this, you know, game publishers and companies will have to start

40:59.380 --> 41:07.780
self-censoring the games and that's never good. So, on top of that though, they have

41:07.780 --> 41:13.840
Louisiana governor has a second bill that's gone in place, which I actually kind of like

41:13.840 --> 41:20.660
this one, it would basically add games to lists of media that can be harmful to minors

41:20.660 --> 41:28.020
and the ESA is actually for this one and what it's supposed to do is basically just kind

41:28.020 --> 41:38.020
of give actual, you know, guidelines to what is, you know, obscene and, you know, basically

41:38.020 --> 41:43.460
not meant for kids. It's kind of like the same law that the normal other media like

41:43.460 --> 41:50.060
TV and movies go by. So that one's pretty good. And that one actually got signed into

41:50.060 --> 41:55.260
law. So that's always good. And I think they did the same thing in Maryland actually with

41:55.260 --> 42:02.680
that kind of law where basically, you know, falls under the obscenity laws. I don't know.

42:02.680 --> 42:09.800
So is this going off the ESRB or what's going to determine? It's basically they have the

42:09.800 --> 42:18.240
guidelines. What it is is if the material incites or appeals or is designed to incite

42:18.240 --> 42:24.500
or appeal to the, I hate law terminology, it's so stupid. But anyways, it's basically

42:24.500 --> 42:29.140
if it's like obscenely offensive if like the game is you know baby raper 2000 or something

42:29.140 --> 42:33.640
like that you know that's not going to be they'll have the right to you know pull that

42:33.640 --> 42:38.340
off the shelves i i would want to try out baby raper 2000 before i start knocking on

42:38.340 --> 42:46.880
it though it could be interesting just kidding jesus god all right anyway so basically it's

42:46.880 --> 42:53.260
you know if it's harmful to minors and i think that they're gonna go by the esrbs you know

42:53.260 --> 42:57.880
reading system for this. I'm not sure, you know, because to be honest, they can take

42:57.880 --> 43:03.380
laws nowadays and just spin them any way that, you know, benefits them. And of course, Jackie

43:03.380 --> 43:07.100
Poo hasn't really said anything on this yet, because I remember that was his law that actually

43:07.100 --> 43:10.780
got, you know, temporarily restrained. So, it should be interesting.

43:10.780 --> 43:16.780
Well, I guess if the ESA isn't arguing with it, then I guess I can go for that.

43:16.780 --> 43:17.780
Yeah.

43:17.780 --> 43:24.100
Well, you know what I think is also pretty ridiculous though is that actually the parents

43:24.100 --> 43:34.100
television council is actually pretty upset about the ESRB's commitment to parents campaign.

43:34.100 --> 43:39.820
Oh, what was this, the ESRB, that's right, they started this campaign about how they're

43:39.820 --> 43:43.540
committed to, I seem to remember reading some stuff on this.

43:43.540 --> 43:46.180
Working with Penny Arcade and having them do the ads.

43:46.180 --> 43:51.320
So who's got sand in their vagina about it?

43:51.320 --> 43:57.340
Basically Tim Winter who is the executive director basically said in his press release

43:57.340 --> 44:01.620
to quote yet another dodge by the video game industry to avoid accountability for the harm

44:01.620 --> 44:05.980
it inflicts on children.

44:05.980 --> 44:12.020
What they don't seem to understand is that it isn't the industry's job to protect their

44:12.020 --> 44:13.020
children.

44:13.020 --> 44:20.020
It's the parent's job to protect their children by limiting, you know, another facility's

44:20.660 --> 44:27.340
free speech. They're, you know, they're basically passing on the responsibility that they agreed

44:27.340 --> 44:32.940
to as parents to another facility. Now, I do agree that, you know, at a certain age

44:32.940 --> 44:39.940
there are certain things you should not be exposed to. However, when you have a child,

44:39.940 --> 44:44.200
you accept the responsibility of guarding your children from those things

44:44.200 --> 44:50.980
that you don't want them to see and this is just them not wanting to take

44:50.980 --> 44:54.340
responsibility for what they need to be doing they want to put the blame on

44:54.340 --> 44:59.340
somebody else instead of their own failures that's how I see it I would

44:59.340 --> 45:02.640
love to get that guy on this program we should say that I we should send an

45:02.640 --> 45:06.620
email well you know I think we should I'm all for lately why don't you want

45:06.620 --> 45:07.620
you work on?

45:07.620 --> 45:08.620
Why don't you...

45:08.620 --> 45:09.620
I will work on trying to get him on.

45:09.620 --> 45:12.240
Did you like how I passed the buck there?

45:12.240 --> 45:13.240
Like I said, let's interview him.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.240
Jamie, you do it.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.580
I'll table it for future discussion.

45:16.580 --> 45:17.580
Alright, sounds good.

45:17.580 --> 45:19.580
We'll make an action item of it.

45:19.580 --> 45:24.040
Alright, you know this whole topic, these politics and the ignorant people when it comes

45:24.040 --> 45:25.340
to video games and all that stuff.

45:25.340 --> 45:28.740
By the way, for those of you guys listening live tonight, unfortunately it's not gonna

45:28.740 --> 45:33.100
make the podcast because we have to do a little bit of copyrighted material with it, but we

45:33.100 --> 45:37.520
We got a real treat for you in the bonus segment tonight, and this is just going to totally

45:37.520 --> 45:42.220
support this point for those of you guys listening live tonight, and unfortunately I wish I had

45:42.220 --> 45:45.180
something better to say for those of you guys on the podcast, I guess it's just an incentive

45:45.180 --> 45:47.180
to listen live once in a while.

45:47.180 --> 45:50.820
Anyway, this whole topic, I don't know about you guys, but it gets me a little pissed off,

45:50.820 --> 45:55.460
and you know what happens when we get pissed off?

45:55.460 --> 46:00.340
People die, and the FUs of the week are brought upon us.

46:00.340 --> 46:07.340
them must destroy them all.

46:13.060 --> 46:20.060
So, my F.U. of the week goes toward the stupid drunk girl from last night.

46:20.060 --> 46:25.220
I was, I basically, I took my friend Julie to Berkeley yesterday for her

46:25.220 --> 46:27.620
birthday.

46:27.620 --> 46:30.760
You know, because I wasn't going to get to hang out with her tonight for her birthday party.

46:31.340 --> 46:32.720
And we had a good time.

46:32.720 --> 46:37.680
I was really, really worn out and tired, you know, on the way home, so I dropped Julie off

46:37.680 --> 46:40.620
and rested for a little bit at her house so that I'd have enough energy to get home.

46:41.120 --> 46:45.960
And as I was approaching one of the major intersections for anybody who's

46:45.960 --> 46:49.460
in the Sacramento area or who has been here is when you're going

46:49.460 --> 46:55.420
down White Avenue toward the interstate on-ramp right before Marconi.

46:55.420 --> 47:02.420
Basically, this girl, I was in the far left lane, there was a lane between us, and there was a girl in the far right lane, ahead of me.

47:02.420 --> 47:14.420
And she suddenly spins out of control and heard little Mini Cooper, and spun right, and then swerved around left and just went into a full 360 in the middle of the road, and was heading directly for me.

47:14.420 --> 47:23.420
And I threw on my brakes and swerved, and she did the same, and we actually avoided a head-on collision by less than 4 inches.

47:23.420 --> 47:26.860
so uh yeah it was pretty scary so uh

47:26.860 --> 47:30.540
did your whole life flash before your eyes and all that stuff?

47:30.540 --> 47:33.700
I think my brain shut down I was so

47:33.700 --> 47:37.460
I was tired already you know but I I was good to get home

47:37.460 --> 47:41.980
this just had my adrenaline going so bad which actually I'm supposed to avoid

47:41.980 --> 47:47.380
you know by my doctor's orders but anyway I pulled up ahead I watched from my rear view mirror to see

47:47.380 --> 47:48.220
what was going on

47:48.220 --> 47:51.760
she she turned around and started heading up so I just decided just to go

47:51.760 --> 47:53.100
home because I was too

47:53.100 --> 47:58.060
shaken up by it cuz I mean I mean I had headlights flashed in my eyes it was

47:58.060 --> 48:02.620
pretty scary I can't let this comment in chat go by Jamie you got it you got to

48:02.620 --> 48:06.340
hear this one Jeremy Todd one says Jamie you have a lot of close calls and

48:06.340 --> 48:10.900
traffic maybe you're actually the one that's a bad driver no trust me I'm not

48:10.900 --> 48:15.580
the one who drives drunk who spins out in the middle of the road I'm not the

48:15.580 --> 48:22.260
one who bumped into a couple other cars no this I it was actually my good

48:22.260 --> 48:25.660
driving that saved my life only when she's playing Mario Kart is she a bad

48:25.660 --> 48:29.420
driver Mario Kart whatever what did what driving use do you play any driving

48:29.420 --> 48:40.260
games no anyway I got up to one of the lights a few blocks up and a guy in a

48:40.260 --> 48:44.160
Camaro who I knew was a little bit behind me in the other lane pulled up and

48:44.160 --> 48:47.620
said hey what happened what happened and then she pulled up next to him so he

48:47.620 --> 48:50.180
just turned and talked to her like what were you thinking what was going on

48:50.180 --> 48:52.180
What's wrong?

48:57.660 --> 49:03.140
That's by the way exactly what she sounded like I'm not joking and he's like are you drunk and she's

49:05.180 --> 49:11.700
Just you know dark Sakura fire boma and Chad is backing you up saying it's because she lives in California kids

49:12.700 --> 49:18.540
Seriously people here can't drive. They really can't know they can or they can they in a certain parts of Georgia. Isn't that right?

49:18.540 --> 49:29.460
I should have stopped and got her license plate number but honestly I was like I'm getting

49:29.460 --> 49:36.160
away from her and just shot up onto the freeway and went home but that was seriously really

49:36.160 --> 49:42.580
scary it's why you know you've got the oh don't drink and drive like don't do it if

49:42.580 --> 49:50.880
do you are fucking retard if you have it takes for I think a double shot of

49:50.880 --> 49:54.320
liquor depending on your metabolism to you by the way but for a double shot of

49:54.320 --> 49:58.120
liquor it takes about three hours to get it fully out of your system for a beer

49:58.120 --> 50:04.440
it's about the same she her eyes were so dilated it wasn't funny I could see from

50:04.440 --> 50:09.920
from you two lanes over Marin and chat says she plays Derby owners Club that's

50:09.920 --> 50:18.640
kind of like driving right guys guys beating my horse all right and everybody who drives drunk

50:18.640 --> 50:27.360
a big humongous porkin fuck you i hope that you get arrested all right loki um i kind of have

50:28.320 --> 50:31.280
just you know the whole story reminds me of the time that i was driving

50:32.000 --> 50:37.360
don't ask me why to play ddr like midnight over at you know ccl you know country club

50:37.360 --> 50:42.160
lanes the ultra ghetto bowling alley that had the DVR but it's open 24 hours a day anyways

50:42.160 --> 50:46.400
that was a long time ago but there's this guy who was in a van who um swerved across all the traffic

50:46.400 --> 50:50.960
and swerved back over and went on the off-ramp but except for making the turn for the off-ramp

50:50.960 --> 50:56.240
just kind of jumped over the lane and kind of drove off road for a little bit that was funny

50:56.240 --> 51:00.000
because i was like i'm all and that guy's like not really you know paying attention where he's

51:00.000 --> 51:05.920
going i'm like whoa oh he just went over the edge but that's funny but um okay yeah on tephews um

51:05.920 --> 51:13.260
Um, fuck you to stupid 24 hour fitness, because I went and signed up, I mean granted this

51:13.260 --> 51:19.340
is how every single place is, where they have your sign up fee or whatever, and then they

51:19.340 --> 51:22.420
have a processing fee of like $70.

51:22.420 --> 51:28.780
What exactly are they doing for that $70, because I saw her process the account and

51:28.780 --> 51:35.100
basically type it into a computer for about one minute, so that was $77 worth of work

51:35.100 --> 51:42.100
right there? I don't think so. And by the way, for $77 she needs to learn how to type.

51:42.620 --> 51:48.720
My F.U. goes to that great big ball of fire in the sky, the sun. I went to a theme park

51:48.720 --> 51:53.420
in the Bay Area called Great America yesterday to kind of celebrate my birthday with some

51:53.420 --> 51:59.020
friends. And I, believe me, I'm not stupid, I put sunscreen like all over, all over, you

51:59.020 --> 52:04.460
know, just SPF 60 because I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to get burned up. However,

52:04.460 --> 52:07.980
It didn't really occur to me that, oh Rob, you have spiky hair now?

52:07.980 --> 52:13.580
You should probably put some sunblock on your scalp, because basically what I ended up with

52:13.580 --> 52:18.660
is a sunburned scalp, and you can see a little bit of the redness there here in studio, where

52:18.660 --> 52:21.340
basically the top of my head got sunburned.

52:21.340 --> 52:25.700
So F you to the sun for burning people, that's not a nice thing to do to the creatures of

52:25.700 --> 52:26.700
the earth.

52:26.700 --> 52:30.420
Uh, Magus, we'll give you one quick F you if you got one.

52:30.420 --> 52:35.620
Alright and this is not normally something I F you, but this is the first time I'm going

52:35.620 --> 52:36.620
to hear this.

52:36.620 --> 52:43.620
F you to Blizzard in the 1.11 patch that just came out on Tuesday.

52:43.620 --> 52:49.100
They added new content, next ramus, that kind of stuff, revamped a lot of things, mage and

52:49.100 --> 52:55.100
shaman talent reviews, but they made one crucial error, they made the looking for group channel

52:55.100 --> 53:03.740
global across the entire population of the server uh while players if you know goldshire if you know

53:03.740 --> 53:10.300
baron's chat it's now across the entire server don't even try to use the lfg channel to lfg

53:12.300 --> 53:17.500
see they had failed to take into account how utterly stupid 95% of their player base is

53:17.500 --> 53:19.500
I

53:19.560 --> 53:21.560
Wondered why that channel was

53:21.880 --> 53:28.380
Frickin off the charts in chat. I'm like there cannot be this many people looking for like, you know

53:29.060 --> 53:35.820
Rage fire chasm and dead mines in silver pine forest. I'm like what the hell is wrong. Okay, that makes sense

53:35.820 --> 53:37.820
Wow, that was stupid of blizzard

53:38.260 --> 53:39.940
Good job guys

53:39.940 --> 53:42.900
All right. Wow, that was like our longest fu segment ever. I'm sorry you guys

53:43.620 --> 53:45.620
all right, I

53:45.620 --> 53:50.640
I wanted to say real quick before we get back into the news, to follow up to the chat question

53:50.640 --> 53:53.640
earlier, how much does an original Xbox cost?

53:53.640 --> 53:57.760
Here's the weird thing, I've gone to like five different sites, I'm not able to find

53:57.760 --> 54:02.280
a new Xbox, did they stop making them and I just forgot they did?

54:02.280 --> 54:08.760
I guess then here's the deal, you can get them on gamestop.com and I imagine EB as well,

54:08.760 --> 54:15.600
a refurb system is $99 for most of the used ones, you can get a factory refurb for $120

54:15.600 --> 54:22.600
$99.99, but it looks like if you want a new one from Microsoft themselves, Tough Poop.

54:22.600 --> 54:31.600
Tough Poopy. Oh man. Anyways, so yeah, that kind of sucks that you can't get those. I

54:31.600 --> 54:35.400
know that they stopped making them for a little bit, but one of the games that you will be

54:35.400 --> 54:39.920
able to play on the Xbox as well as the Xbox 360, or at least I think it's going to be

54:39.920 --> 54:46.440
on the Xbox, maybe not. Need for Speed Carbon, which should be just called Need for Speed

54:46.440 --> 54:51.480
Carbon Copy because it looks very similar to Most Wanted, although they're saying that

54:51.480 --> 54:55.260
it's going to be more like Underground 2. Whatever the case, one of the things that

54:55.260 --> 55:00.380
they did post on Game Informer's website was a sneak peek at the trailer for it, which

55:00.380 --> 55:06.000
basically shows canyon runs that are being done in the middle of the night. And apparently

55:06.000 --> 55:09.840
this is going to be part of the game where you can basically race on these really narrow

55:09.840 --> 55:15.520
circuits alongside deadly pitfalls and if you drift too far you will fly over the edge

55:15.520 --> 55:22.960
and die. But anyways, so they're trying to make it seems like more like maybe Initial

55:22.960 --> 55:28.280
D-ish if you know if racing along twisting highways and stuff. But I did see some other

55:28.280 --> 55:32.900
screenshots which looks like it's going to be also more city racing. Expect this to be

55:32.900 --> 55:35.940
be like any other Need for Speed game out there.

55:35.940 --> 55:40.580
I just have a real quick thing to interject before we move on. Why is it that Wang Gan

55:40.580 --> 55:45.780
has not come out for a console anywhere? Midnight Maximum Tune, you know the whole spiel there.

55:45.780 --> 55:50.500
Like, top ten soundtracks of all time, for me, honestly. I love the soundtrack to that game.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.820
And you know what I do, is I actually load it on, or I have some of the tracks loaded,

55:54.820 --> 55:59.060
I want to get the whole soundtrack loaded on my computer to use when I play Burnout.

55:59.060 --> 56:05.560
You know, screw EA tracks. I want my, you know, Yuzo Koshiro tracks playing when I play Burnout. It's awesome.

56:07.060 --> 56:11.060
I don't know why I decided to interject that there, but why won't that stinking game come out on console?

56:11.060 --> 56:13.060
I'm sick of all these other series. I want that game.

56:13.060 --> 56:15.060
They have Tokyo Extreme Racers supposed to be coming out.

56:15.060 --> 56:19.060
That's probably as close as you're gonna get it. I don't know why.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.560
It would make sense.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.060
Weird.

56:21.060 --> 56:24.060
Especially with all that drift culture stuff nowadays.

56:24.060 --> 56:27.560
I know with the Fast and the Furious Tokyo drifting or whatever that thing is.

56:27.560 --> 56:33.140
I love how the commercials for that totally spoiled the like after-credits ending thing I

56:33.780 --> 56:38.600
Didn't even bother I could care less Loki. I could care less by the movie. All right. Anyway, sorry

56:38.780 --> 56:45.700
Well to cleanse the palette of drifting. We actually have some confirmation by

56:46.460 --> 56:48.460
Uchiyama Daisuke who is

56:48.820 --> 56:50.820
Namco Bandai's chief producer

56:50.820 --> 56:56.100
stating that there will be both Tekken and Soul Calibur games being worked on

56:56.100 --> 57:01.620
on the... well they're not saying specifically what system it's going to be on, but we are

57:01.620 --> 57:06.660
going to get a new Soul Calibur, a new Tekken, and the guess is that it will be PS3.

57:06.660 --> 57:14.780
Especially since there was already some sort of tech demo for Tekken on PS3 already.

57:14.780 --> 57:17.980
That's right, I seem to remember something at Sony's press conference too about that whole

57:17.980 --> 57:24.980
And Soul Calibur 3 was a Playstation 2 exclusive, so that would seem to indicate maybe it will

57:24.980 --> 57:25.980
continue.

57:25.980 --> 57:31.980
I don't know, I like what they did with Soul Calibur 2, with the different special

57:31.980 --> 57:35.740
characters on different systems, because we actually own all of them.

57:35.740 --> 57:36.740
Pantsless Pope?

57:36.740 --> 57:42.140
That was pretty awesome, the Pope character that had no pants that I made.

57:42.140 --> 57:48.920
Here's the thing though, I think Soul Calibur 2 is more of a memorable game.

57:48.920 --> 57:54.120
When we look back on gaming history now, I think I will think of Soul Calibur 2 before

57:54.120 --> 57:56.040
I think of Soul Calibur 3.

57:56.040 --> 57:59.840
Don't get me wrong, Soul Calibur 3 is a solid game, but I think just because of all those

57:59.840 --> 58:06.240
mixed releases they did, the arcade release, Soul Calibur 2 is just much more of a big

58:06.240 --> 58:08.440
release than Soul Calibur 3.

58:08.440 --> 58:13.660
And I'm hoping that Soul Calibur IV can maybe, you know, live up to that bar that Soul Calibur

58:13.660 --> 58:14.660
II set.

58:14.660 --> 58:18.440
You know, it's hard to say that Soul Calibur III didn't live up to the bar, but in some

58:18.440 --> 58:19.440
ways it didn't.

58:19.440 --> 58:24.360
Even though it was like a great game, it wasn't a, when I look back in 15 years I'm gonna

58:24.360 --> 58:27.520
remember this next to Soul Calibur II type game.

58:27.520 --> 58:28.520
I don't know.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
Maybe you guys feel differently.

58:29.520 --> 58:30.520
Do you, Chatroom?

58:30.520 --> 58:31.520
I don't know.

58:31.520 --> 58:32.520
I don't know.

58:32.520 --> 58:37.080
I think Soul Calibur, I don't know, I think Soul Calibur III didn't do as well as II.

58:37.080 --> 58:42.920
Especially the fact when you release something on one system as opposed to three, you're

58:42.920 --> 58:45.760
obviously going to get less sales.

58:45.760 --> 58:49.040
And now of course we have the chat room is lighting up with some feedback there, which

58:49.040 --> 58:50.520
is what I was hoping here.

58:50.520 --> 58:54.000
Jeremy Todd 1 says, Link on Soul Calibur 2 rocked my socks.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.840
That's one reason many people are going to remember Soul Calibur 2 was the addition of

58:56.840 --> 59:02.680
Link, which seemed so random at the time, but just was awesome for the GameCube owners.

59:02.680 --> 59:06.620
Bandit says, you know what, Tekken is so much better than Soul Calibur, so he's more excited

59:06.620 --> 59:09.460
about the Tekken game that's coming out on PS3.

59:09.460 --> 59:12.780
And Dark Knight says, hey, what about the original, Soul Edge?

59:12.780 --> 59:17.380
You know, honestly, when you look at this, it's kind of like when you look at any series.

59:17.380 --> 59:22.780
Like for me anyway, like I remember, you know, Zelda on the Super Nintendo almost more than

59:22.780 --> 59:23.780
I do the original.

59:23.780 --> 59:24.780
Well, that's not true.

59:24.780 --> 59:28.660
I do have a lot of love for the original, so I'm trying to think of a series that's

59:28.660 --> 59:32.380
kind of like where one of the sequels stands out more than maybe the original does.

59:32.380 --> 59:34.360
How about Castlevania, okay?

59:34.360 --> 59:38.120
Like you think about, you know, when I look at the series, Symphony of the Night was like

59:38.120 --> 59:41.660
the game that will just, I don't think any other Castlevania game they ever released

59:41.660 --> 59:45.720
will come close to the greatness of Symphony of the Night, even more so than the original

59:45.720 --> 59:46.720
for me.

59:46.720 --> 59:50.600
So, I don't know, that's kind of how I feel about Soul Calibur, but I'm sure you guys

59:50.600 --> 59:53.680
feel differently, but we've all got opinions.

59:53.680 --> 59:58.240
Anyway, another game that had tons and tons and tons of sequels was King's Quest.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.360
Remember this whole game, King's Quest?

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.840
on the PC years ago Roberta Williams King Quest and they had you know five

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.240
and six for some of the first games on CD-ROM well they went back Sierra and

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:14.160
they remade one and two a while ago and they gave them fancy VGA graphics but

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.080
one game they never really went back and upgraded that much was King's Quest 3 so

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:23.760
what's happened is that the fans and I you remember a while back when we had we

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.200
even had some of the King's Quest fan community on here and they were they

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.960
were making like the the fan game in the series all that I mean King's Quest fans

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.880
are passionate about these games and this just goes to prove it King's Quest 3 to

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:40.040
air as human has been remade and this has been remade by Infamous Adventures

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:45.720
and this remake features all new VGA backgrounds, enhanced close-up cutscenes,

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.320
dialogue portraits for all the characters, original music by a

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.640
professional composer, a full speech pack, and a new point-and-click interface.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:02.020
Basically, Infamous Adventures believes this game is still relevant, and no profit is being

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.140
made off the game.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.460
You can download it free of charge, 43.2 megabytes is how big the game is.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:12.060
It's at Infamous-Adventures.com.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.740
And honestly guys, if you don't have GameTap, because GameTap has a lot of the King's Quest

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.580
games in there, I would highly recommend you guys check this out.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.900
I'm just going to assume it's like the original.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.060
I haven't had a chance to check it out myself yet, I want to.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.280
I would highly recommend you download it as quick as possible because it'll probably be

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.180
pulled off

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.620
by some copyright. Well now that one person's downloaded it, it'll forever be floating in the

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.600
internet somewhere

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.000
So, you know, check this out. King's Quest was a great series of games.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.020
King's Quest was pretty cool. I just, you know,

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.700
I couldn't get into it too much, but I think I want to play Peasant's Quest.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.680
Peasant's Quest? What?

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.100
On the Homestar Runner site. Oh, you know, actually I would...

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.540
I'm you, Trogdor!

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.500
I think the easiest one to get into out of the series, and I don't know, King's Quest

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.340
Hardcore fans may disagree with me, but I think King's Quest IV, the one with the...

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.540
I actually tried to start with King's Quest V and I couldn't get into it.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.540
Really?

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.500
And Magus, you're saying V, why?

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.660
I'm saying V because I got started on the series on NES and it was the first King's

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.660
Quest release that I got to play.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:20.700
Unfortunately I didn't really get into it past V, but I did get to go into the previous

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.440
games a little bit, so I got to start on 5, so I think it was the easiest for me.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.240
Alright, going to the chat room for some quick feedback before we move on here.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.360
VidPowah says, I'd like to point out that while Sierra did remake KQ1, it was a total

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.520
market failure.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.080
AGD took over the reins of remaking it, and for free.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.560
I guess that's kind of an interesting point there.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.560
I think Sierra had a couple of their old games remade back in the day.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.180
And then, let's see, some folks, Sexy Stalker is commenting, shameless game tap plug.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.320
They don't pay us, you know, we just think they do have a pretty interesting service,

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.420
but it's really up to you guys if you want it or not.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:01.820
And then, Gamerman55 in chat says, Sky, we want some real news, not old games.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.820
You know what, though?

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:07.920
Even though, yes, this is an old game, I think this speaks more volumes about what fan communities

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.860
in the gaming world are capable of doing.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:14.600
I mean, it is not an easy task to remake a game with graphics.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.880
I know I sure as hell couldn't program it, so I think it is kind of noteworthy when these

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:24.200
gaming fan communities go, you know, over and above the Call of Fandom.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.360
Speaking of which, there has been another remake that's kind of been a little off the

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.760
radar.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:39.200
A lot of FPS fans know that when Valve released Half-Life 2, they redid Half-Life 1 for the

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:45.480
source engine, and it had quite a few problems with the new source physics engine. There's

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.800
actually a fan group, I can't remember the site right now, but there's a fan group dedicated

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.940
to completely redoing, remaking the original Half-Life in the source engine, and they're

01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:00.320
calling Black Mesa Source. I believe they're still in the planning stages, but they're

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:05.680
working on getting all the voice actors, the texture maps, completely redoing the maps

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.400
making it uh... a better experience

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.280
so uh... if you have the time you might want to check that out as well

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.380
I'd like to see remade in the source engine

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.880
Duke Nukem 3D

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.000
you know there's loving a game and then there's

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.440
looooooving a game I mean these guys love their game

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.980
anyway

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.280
I have release dates

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.440
alright so speaking of games

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.740
some non-fan games and some of these are

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.260
Well, these games may have fans very soon.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:41.500
Actually, one of the titles surprises me because I thought you couldn't use Ninja in a title

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.580
in the UK, but I guess you can.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.420
It's coming out on the 30th, a whole crap load of games.

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.100
We have Shinobi Doule of the Ninja.

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:55.540
We have Over-G Fighters on Xbox 360, New Super Mario Bros., Micro Machines, Flatout 2, Devil

01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:03.720
May Cry 3 Special Edition, Def Jam Fight for New York, Brick Em All, we've also got Super

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.420
Monkey Ball Adventure, Swords of Destiny, Siphon Filter, Dark Mirror, Titan Quest, Untold

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.560
Legends, The Warrior Code, and also before that on the 29th is Panzer Command Operation

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.620
Winter Storm on PC.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.620
Excellent.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.380
How about in the U.S.?

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:24.780
U.S., not a whole lot, but if you're a Pirates of the Caribbean fan and you happen to have

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.100
a portable console, then you'll be happy to know that Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:35.380
Chest has arrived. Um, actually I played a little bit of it at E3. It is pretty good.

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:41.020
I don't know, it's your typical, you know, action game. Anyways, um, Micro Machines though

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:46.820
is coming out on PlayStation 2, Micro Machines Volume 4, as well as the PSP. Are Micro Machines

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:51.960
still around? I don't know. What the hell? Magus is shaking his head no. But the game

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.980
looks fun I don't know okay yeah it's fun who cares well no we're to ultimate

01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:02.760
ninja for the you enemy fighting fans also let's see here rough trigger the

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:07.500
Vanna core conspiracy which is some weird budget game where you play a

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:14.960
werewolf um you know what I believe there is one 360 game which was over G

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.960
fighters is coming out this week which is supposed to be kind of like ace

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:24.840
combat, but I don't know, not a whole lot. Not a whole lot at all. It's a slow period

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:30.840
for games though. Sudoku Gridmaster, that was the other one. Whoopee! But it's by Nintendo.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:36.280
I'm... I don't know. I'm burned out on Sudoku. If you own a GameCube though, nada anything

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:45.560
for you. You suck. That's what your retails says. But anyways, you know, we can't be all

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:52.560
I still gotta buy my copy of Crusty Demons so I can come over and play it.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.520
But one of the games I will not be buying is the 10th anniversary edition of Tomb Raider

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.720
because I honestly hate Tomb Raider.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.920
But you know what?

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.780
It is confirmed though, Eidos has come out and said they are remaking the very first

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.780
Tomb Raider.

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:10.520
It's supposed to be arriving on the Playstation 2, PSP, and PC.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.600
No word yet when, but it's coming soon.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:20.660
So for all you fans of Tomb Raider out there, and I don't know why, but it's coming out

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.660
soon.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:27.340
Well you know, one way that Tomb Raider became ultra-famous was because it had a movie made

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:33.060
out of it, and usually movies are made out of famous games, but this game was a little

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:39.060
more B-list or C-list even, it was more of a cult game, Clock Tower, remember Clock Tower?

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:43.460
Now Clock Tower is kind of cool because, you know, gory, gory murder and the scissors and

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.940
all that scary stuff.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:48.300
However what's interesting about it is that it is being made into a movie.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:53.700
Jorge Olguin is heading up the Clock Tower movie project.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.500
Basically what's happening is that the person who wrote When a Stranger Calls is writing

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.780
a script for this movie.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:06.460
It's I believe Jason Wade Wall is the name of this guy and production is going to start

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.420
on the Clock Tower movie this fall.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.620
Hopefully the movie will be better than when a stranger calls.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.420
Why do people have to pick all this really non-mainstream stuff to make movies out of?

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.420
You know what though? I think it's about the source material for some people, you know?

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.420
If a good movie can be made out of this, and I think it can,

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.420
I think a real scary movie could be made from this pre-

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:31.420
I mean, it's a pretty scary game. I've only played a little, little bit of Clock Tower.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.420
I had a bunch of sequels. Like, wasn't there at least a Clock Tower 3?

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.420
You were playing Clock Tower 3, weren't you?

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:40.100
else that I knew, but I've seen the whole first part of Clock Tower 3. No, last time

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.780
I touched Clock Tower was before we were even doing the show, probably. I want a Contra

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.940
movie. I want, I want, Gimme Gimme Gimme. I want a Silent Hill sequel. Well, you may

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:55.540
get it. I think they broke box office, I don't know, who knows. Who knows, but at the very

01:08:55.540 --> 01:09:01.560
least though, for the July 8th opening in Japan, they actually have a Silent Hill haunted

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:09.920
house called Shocking House that's up from July 2nd with hours 11am to 6pm for our listeners

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.480
in Japan.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.800
And the movie, like I said, opens on July 8th.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:20.960
There was actually a big press conference out where they had someone dressed up as a

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.520
red pyramid and a bunch of, you know, nurses sort of slumped over.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:35.740
And there's also a nice quote from Akira Yamaoka saying that the aim was to make something

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:41.760
enjoyable even if the viewer wasn't familiar with the game, which actually I think did

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.120
a pretty admirable job.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.120
I'm hoping that the movie does pretty well in Japan, too.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.900
I didn't realize that the movie hadn't come out in Japan yet.

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.280
That was kind of the most surprising thing to me.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.240
I thought they got it the same time we did, so I was kind of surprised they still hadn't

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.240
seen it.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:04.920
Usually, I think that it's a difference of, I want to say, one to three months, I think,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:12.280
for a movie that's released in the U.S. to go through, not just translation, localization,

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.960
but also for the recording of their dub script.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.880
Oh, I would have thought they would have taken care of all that in advance, but I guess that

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.880
kind of surprised me.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.120
You know what's interesting though, before we change topics, I thought it was interesting

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.320
because I've been kind of I was reading about this on some various gaming blogs

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.040
and I noticed the Silent Hill movie was getting a lot of crap like that it

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.280
wasn't a great movie and I understand where people didn't like it maybe the

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.400
ones who hadn't played the games but I actually thought as far as video game

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.240
movies go Silent Hill was actually probably one of the best if not the best

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.880
video game movie we've had so far so I don't know why there's this sudden

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.480
backlash because it seems like when the movie first came out these same sites

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.840
We're like pyramid head is awesome. You know, I I was a little surprised by the sudden backlash where it's cool to hate on Silent Hill

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.440
I think it's just I don't understand what the whole trend is with these

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.820
Movie viewers who are looking for like a Oscar

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.140
Quality acting in these movies. I mean first off where are you the judge?

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.400
you know, what is Oscar quality acting in the first place and

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.400
To why the hell would you go to a movie like that anyways expecting that you know

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.040
it's not going to be there you go there because you want to see pyramid head slice people in half

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:27.000
that's that's basically why you would go that didn't quite happen but you know you still got

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.800
cool pyramid head yeah you got you know it's a horror movie horror movies are supposed to be

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:39.080
campy and bloody that's what they are i mean they're not like i don't know it's not casablanca

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.680
with blood i mean it's just a movie uh lots of feedback in our chat room and then we'll get

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.520
Actually, Magus, do you want to comment first?

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.520
People who expect a lot out of video game movies, just be grateful that it's not like

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520
Wing Commander.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.520
VXJ6V says, Silent Hill was an awesome movie.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.640
Jeremy Todd 1 says, you know, it's because of the hype of the movie.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.680
When they just got back from seeing it, they were all like, OMG, that was so awesome.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.200
Then a month or two later, yeah, that movie sucked.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.260
SSJ100Matt says, who are you to judge?

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.600
It's not Oscar quality.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:21.600
It's not what typically gets nominated for an Oscar. You don't really see horror movies up there too often.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.600
I think that it was really good. I think that the acting in it was pretty darn good, especially since they had the Borg Queen.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.600
Oh, she was so cool.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.600
I think some people are kind of pissed off by the second half of the movie, which involved the Borg Queen character,

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:41.600
but at the same time, you know, a movie is very hard to do with, you know, one person.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.760
I don't know if the only movie I can think of that's really pulled it off is like some

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.620
of the Alien movies, but I don't know.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:49.620
I wasn't mad by the movie.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:50.620
I thought it was great.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:51.620
Anyway.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.620
I don't know.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.620
Could have been worse.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.620
Exactly.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.460
You know, all these people being critical on stuff.

01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:02.820
One person though that was critical on things would be, or I should say one site, somethingawful.com.

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.060
They are always ripping apart bad movies, which I might add, all those bad movies I

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.660
tend to buy because they read them bad.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.660
So you kind of go to something awful dot com and use that as your checklist of what to

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:12.660
buy?

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.660
Exactly.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:14.660
Because I have a My Bad Movie collection.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.660
That's interesting.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.660
That's interesting.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.660
But one person though, it goes back to last week, you know the whole Ooey Bowl challenging

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.060
critics of his movies.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:31.680
Well it was interesting to note, Rich Kianka of something awful dot com who goes by Lotax,

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:37.820
he actually wrote Ooey Bowl to see if he could be able to fight him.

01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:43.800
Now interesting note, he has not, as of writing that letter, he had not written anything bad

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.560
about, you know, Weeble's movies, but Weeble said, yeah, sure, go ahead.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:55.200
So he decided to go ahead and officially write a review for House of the Dead which, or Alone

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.200
in the Dark I should say.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:03.940
House of the Dead one's coming later and yeah, it's just basically a really bad movie.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:09.060
But um, it's interesting to see though that he kind of bent the rules to be able to fight

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.580
this guy.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.860
So that is one person that he will be fighting.

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.540
So maybe I can do it.

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:20.660
More people probably read somethingawful.com than actually went and saw Blood Rain.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:24.980
So you know, Uwe Boll probably has something to win from this.

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.540
You know, it's so interesting because I don't like Uwe Boll's movies.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:35.100
I mean I understand how bad they are and how they might be funny to watch just you know

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.420
pointing out all the flaws in them.

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.740
I kind of want to see Postal now.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:43.500
I kind of want to see it just because you can't really mess up Postal.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.600
There's no plot to it.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.220
It's just basically violence.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.900
It's got Gary Coleman in it which that's awesome right there and it's going to have a boxing

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.620
match with Uwe Boll and a bunch of movie critics at the end.

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.500
I mean that sounds cool.

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.020
I think it could work.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.780
You know, more people are probably interested in seeing Lotex get his ass beat, and before

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:08.220
I say that, I'm not slamming something awful, I'm not a goon yet, but there are people out

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:12.100
on the internet that would love to see Lotex get his ass beat, especially by Uwe Boll.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.020
See I think this is what Uwe Boll needs to do.

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:19.060
He needs to get out of the video game movie thing and just start making mindlessly violent

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.940
or cheesy campy movies.

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:25.840
Because he's got the kind of thing down with, you know, Alone in the Dark and stuff.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.980
Just make your own source material, that way people can't say, oh, it's not even near the

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:31.980
game or something like that.

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:37.460
That's what he needs to do, because he doesn't understand how to make good movies, so make

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:43.480
campy, crappy movies that have a lot of B actors in it, and just go crazy with that.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.800
Snakes on a Plane is a perfect example of something you can do to that effect, but just

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.120
go crazy with it.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.600
That's where some of the best movies out there are movies that don't make sense, like giant

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.280
crickets attacking the earth, that doesn't make any sense.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.960
they're they're good to watch

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.280
uh... g k one twenty eight seems to back up what you're saying loki says uh...

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.700
postal will be awful but at least we'll expect it

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:08.040
exactly if it's if there's

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.680
guy gets angry goes kill things i mean

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.500
pretty simple to me i don't know

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:18.240
i don't know it worked for what was that uh... movie

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.080
shoot now i can remember falling down falling down

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.080
I like that falling down was a good movie

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.980
If he makes it like falling down then I'll go see it. Honestly, though if we bowl if we bowls

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.940
Postal was playing next door to another fucking Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock movie

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:41.140
I would rather if forced to gunpoint go see the Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock movie than that

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.900
So I mean so how fast I don't want in other words

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.740
I really just don't want to see postal how fast does the lake house have to be traveling before it?

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.500
so doesn't explode I

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.840
I think we need a break now.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840
