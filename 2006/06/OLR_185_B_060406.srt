the day so check out the schedule over there on allgames.com for more

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,640
information on that. Meanwhile let's get back into the gaming news. We're going to

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,680
start off with news on a anticipated Xbox peripheral, right Loki? Yes, the Xbox

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,320
Live Vision camera. Major Nelson has announced that it's going to be coming to both the

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,720
European and North American markets on the 19th of September and of course this

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,960
also ties in with the upcoming update which will add more functionality to the

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,400
for the camera on live. Supposedly you're going to be able to actually use the pictures

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,280
that you take as gamer tags. So that's kind of neat. You can use the pictures on there

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,960
instead of what they have. Which also opens it up for a lot of really naughty things on

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,200
there. And of course if you have UNO right now you can also use it in that. And one of

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,760
the bundles that actually has been rumored out there is they're going to be bundling

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,060
UNO with the camera so it's kind of neat.

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,400
I like that some of the game blogs have been kind of bringing up the point

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,400
what the hell are you going to do with a camera in UNO? I mean

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,080
look at my ugly face while I play UNO. I mean what...

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,960
Well there's nothing to it. You're talking about one of the people testing the camera right now and what

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,240
they did is they put it on their dog. So you see their dog panting just going

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,920
heh, heh, heh, heh. I think that's great

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,400
because I mean I don't know

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,100
They had some like this, they had the itoy chat, but it's a game, you had to buy it,

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,340
and that was lame.

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,420
I think they should have totally done this before a lot of this stuff.

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,660
What I want to know, how many games of Strip Uno are we going to see, because that's really

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,100
the only practical use of this peripheral that I can think of is Strip Uno, you know,

34
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,100
and voice-chatting.

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Does it do voice-chatting?

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,220
Yeah, you can use voice-chat, and you can do video chat and stuff.

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,800
Well, that might be kind of cool, because you might hear when you get a draw for a while

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
to get some...

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
So people...

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Fuck you!

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,260
People can actually do, imagine if you will, over live, you could have video phone sex.

42
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,080
If you ever wanted to show your naughty bits to strangers, here you go, because you know

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
you can find...

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,780
But please, 18 and over only, how are they going to stop slutty 17 year olds from doing

45
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780
this?

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
I don't want to see that.

47
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,420
you know I don't really want to know how they're going to try to stop them but that's still

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,780
going to make for a more interesting game and it's like ah I'm quitting I guess they'll

49
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,460
get warned I guess they figure the community will police itself it's like you know they're

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,420
going to use the peripheral to be able to map your face on characters like say for example

51
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,140
playing multiplayer Rainbow Six Vegas or whatever oh look he has a penis for a head that's interesting

52
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,460
exactly how many boobs are you going to be playing against literally going to the chat

53
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,260
chat room over at orangelaunchvideo.com, click on chat, Guinness Goblin says we strip Uno,

54
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:53,300
fat naked gamers, Amplitude One says strip Monopoly, I think, over in the chat room there,

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,540
well they are coming out with poker later, so we'll see, alright, also that's not the

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,400
only peripheral that's coming out for the Xbox 360, there's apparently a mole within

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,640
the uh... microsoft organization that has some news on other things that are

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,440
coming out and this all makes sense

59
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,720
uh... new face plates with halo forza 2 and viva pinata are gonna be on their

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,440
way out

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,080
a wireless headset is coming out but as far as i know

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,320
i was listening to another podcast i want to say it was all games interactive

63
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,960
where they bought

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,440
scott for his birthday a headset that was wireless so this must be the

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,320
official

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,480
microsoft headsets coming out but you can already get a non-official one

67
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,260
They have some pretty cool looking ones that are out right now, but the new wireless one

68
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,700
is kinda nifty looking. It's like, I don't really know how to describe it.

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,560
Do you really need a wireless headset though? I mean, maybe for DDR.

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,420
Again, I don't talk to people when I play DDR. They'd hear me going,

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,300
heh, heh, heh, heh. I think it would be nice to have one, just

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,880
maybe just to see if, you know, the wireless headset is any better than the normal

73
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,640
headset, because

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,180
the normal headset kinda sucks. A wireless gaming receiver is coming out too for twenty

75
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,280
bucks. I wonder, does that mean like a router?

76
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:12,280
No, that receiver is actually for your PC, it's going to plug into the USB, it's so you can use your wireless controllers and peripherals with your PC.

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, okay. Oh, that's kind of neat. I like that.

78
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,280
And a 256 megabyte memory unit for those of you that are actually using memory units. All three of you.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Just spend the extra money and buy a hard drive. Seriously?

80
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Seriously.

81
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Loki, some controversy in the Xbox 360 community, yes?

82
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,920
Yes, yes, Peter Moore said something retarded, basically gamers don't care about backwards

83
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,560
compatibility.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,000
And he says nobody is concerned about backwards compatibility.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,640
We under promised and over delivered on that, which if I remember correctly, no they didn't.

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,740
And it's a very complicated thing, very complex work, I'm just stunned that we have hundreds

87
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,260
of games that are backwards compatible.

88
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,220
He also added, um, more are coming but at some point you just go, there's enough, let's

89
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,340
move on.

90
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,580
Or people aren't as worried about game being backwards compatible.

91
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,800
And I like to think that we've upheld our end of the bargain in making at least two

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,940
or maybe three hundred games backwards compatible.

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,980
No, I actually believe you said you were going to make them all backwards compatible, so

94
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,340
wouldn't that be

95
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,460
upholding your end of the

96
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,260
bargain there at all.

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,900
And

98
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,780
you know what?

99
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,660
That's pretty poor that they don't have all the games backwards compatible because

100
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,860
other systems can do it.

101
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,620
PlayStation 2 had no trouble doing it and

102
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,940
you know I understand that they are emulating,

103
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,780
you know, granted another

104
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,860
graphics card set or whatever but

105
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,140
who cares, that's your problem not mine. That's right, it's your problem for doing that.

106
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,760
and I you know what PlayStation 3 here's one good thing at least I can say about

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,340
PlayStation 3 if it truly is

108
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,580
backwards compatible with all PlayStation 2 and 1 games that's a huge

109
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,780
bonus and now what about the people now that say why do you buy a new console to

110
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,340
play all your old games on what would be a response

111
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,900
to people that are saying that? Well for example when you have one game coming

112
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,060
out in the month and you may not want that game

113
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,860
you know what it's nice to be able to buy some older games also drives more game

114
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,580
sales because now there's more games you can play instead of

115
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,660
you know, maybe the thirty or forty that are out right now, you can go and play

116
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,460
three hundred.

117
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,540
And for those that may have limited shelf space too. Exactly.

118
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,460
And also you bought a new system, you know, maybe you sold your Xbox, maybe it took

119
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,860
you know, a

120
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,780
dump and just like basically you know, failed on you.

121
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,620
And now you have a new system and you want to be able to, or for example, you know, what

122
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,780
they should have done since, you know, PlayStation 2 is backwards compatible with all the

123
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,240
PlayStation 1 titles.

124
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,380
Say, for example, you have an Xbox game that comes out and you want to play it, you know,

125
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,220
and that might not be on the 360, like, say, for example, The Godfather, because the 360

126
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,120
version hasn't come out yet, and maybe you want to play that game, oh, well, you can't,

127
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,980
because it's not backwards compatible.

128
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
I don't know.

129
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,420
Granted, there is a point, you know, where you just have to say, you know, forget it,

130
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,780
but I, I don't know, unless they make a portable system that plays the old Xbox games or something

131
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
like that, you know, you never know.

132
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:18,220
Moving on, on a related note, there is a backwards compatibility update coming in the next couple

133
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,460
weeks to Xbox Live.

134
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,280
It is actually coming out, this was announced on the Gamerscore blog, somebody from the

135
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,300
Microsoft team said that there is a backwards compatibility update coming out within the

136
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,460
next few weeks, quote unquote, but at the same time, I seem to recall hearing that that

137
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,880
download things in the background patch was coming out last week and that didn't happen,

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,840
So I would imagine it's possible that the backwards compatibility thing will be pushed

139
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
back.

140
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,240
No word on what games are going to be backwards compatible.

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
So we don't know.

142
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,120
I don't know if you're going to get your beach volleyball yet, or you need your guide.

143
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
Well that's the thing that's really sad is all these updates have come out.

144
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
We had one that added most of the Tom Clancy games.

145
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,520
We had another one that added three other games.

146
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,200
What happened to updates every month?

147
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
What the hell?

148
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
I mean, that's pretty sad.

149
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,720
I feel sorry for the backwards compatibility team, because it feels like we're picking

150
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,300
on them a little bit, but probably they're just under, like, uh, they probably got under

151
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,340
budgeted or whatever.

152
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,480
They're probably working their butts off, they just don't have the resources to do it.

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
It is not their fault.

154
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm just saying, you know, don't promise that you're going to have updates every month.

155
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,800
Don't promise that you're going to have all the games backwards compatible, if you're

156
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
not going to do it.

157
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,160
Say, we're going to support the major titles, and that's it.

158
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,680
More and more will be coming, you know, as the year progresses.

159
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,240
That's what you need to do instead of saying, yeah, all the games are going to be backwards

160
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,380
compatible and because basically you're lying you know it's like buying say if I

161
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,140
went out to buy a car right now and they promised me that that car is gonna fly

162
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:53,220
okay eventually well that's a blatant lie I mean granted technology may come

163
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,380
out that may allow my car to fly one of these days but uh if that's not

164
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,780
something that you're currently working on doing or you know have no plans on

165
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:07,780
doing, then don't fucking promise it. Simple as that.

166
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,580
Moving on, Loki has some further news from Microsoft. Well, kinda. This is more a rumor

167
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,180
department, but this is a rumor that keeps coming up in regards to Microsoft, isn't it?

168
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:25,380
Yeah, we talked about it a while back. I don't remember what podcast it was on, but anyways.

169
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,420
there's a group, the diffusion group, that's saying that Microsoft is planning on launching

170
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,420
a portable game system in the market in 2008. And basically they're giving the 360 some

171
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,260
time to pick up steam. Possibly, I wouldn't see why they wouldn't. I mean, cause that's

172
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,640
a market that, you know granted Nintendo's doing pretty good in, Sony's doing okay in,

173
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,200
they're not really I mean it's not anything that's you know totally

174
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,220
dominating the market they don't have any you know must-have games people

175
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,000
aren't going out there and just dying to get a PSP because of X game on there so

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,220
sure why not I don't know now wait a minute I said I know what show it was on

177
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,920
that you talked about this for was right before III because you brought some

178
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,900
story in from a business magazine saying X player or something what happened with

179
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,920
That's what I think that they were talking about.

180
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,760
It's the same thing.

181
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,420
It's some team that they had working on,

182
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,060
developed the 360 or something that was working on this.

183
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,440
And I wish I had that magazine,

184
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,700
but I threw it out a while ago,

185
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,420
so we'd have to dig through the podcast

186
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,020
to find exactly what I said.

187
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,980
But that's basically it, yeah.

188
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,180
They're working on something.

189
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,860
If anything, you'll probably see it at E3

190
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,540
or next year or the year after that.

191
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,380
Interesting.

192
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,100
Be a very interesting move by Microsoft.

193
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,220
Alright, let's get away from Microsoft for a little bit. Well, actually, this is a game

194
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,320
that you can play on the 360 among other systems. DarkSakura has a little bit of news on Final

195
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,040
Fantasy XI. Yes?

196
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,400
Yep. We all like our chocobos, right?

197
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,540
They're tasty.

199
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Stop it.

200
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,420
They go good with honey sauce. Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, fine.

201
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,740
Squeenix is talking about raising your birds. Yep. On the official site, they basically

202
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,260
we're comparing chocobo raising to gardening something that would require a

203
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,500
little bit of your time for one to three months you begin by finding an egg

204
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,620
actually that sort of makes me think of Ragnarok you know you find your egg and

205
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,940
then you have to but this in this way though you care for your egg by spending

206
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,700
you know by helping it hatch you use certain items to help it and then you

207
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,100
feed it and you spend time with it and you raise your baby chocobo and you name

208
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,100
your chocobo and apparently you'll just be able to do all kinds of stuff with

209
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,100
your chocobo that I'm not at liberty to discuss because it sounds kind of

210
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,900
strange but you can apparently breed your chocobos with your you don't sleep

211
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,100
with it do you because that's really gross imagine like living in your

212
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
going, Mommy!

213
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Work, work!

214
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,100
But it should be coming up on the next update.

215
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Interesting. Now I believe I was reading something about it, you have to check it every day.

216
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah.

217
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
So this is just a way to suck you into the game.

218
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,100
You know, play me every day and get something cute.

219
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Addict, addict, addict, addict.

220
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Although I did also read something that there will be a way where you can get, like if you're going on vacation or whatever,

221
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
somebody can babysit your chocobo.

222
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Yeah, like a chocobo sitter.

223
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:57,020
Sitter. They should have the Chocobo Kennel. But it costs money. Like on, remember, on um. Oh, Nintendogs. What was it? Neopets. Oh. How you could, you know, if your animals were all dying, you could just like, you know, put them in the kennel. Mmm. We're all fed! You don't have to take care of them. While also thinking of Nintendogs. You could put your, uh, dogs that you didn't want anymore. You could take them to the kennel. Yeah. Or they could be put down. That's the pound. They'll put them down if you leave them there for too long. That's a scene in Nintendogs. Mine all ran away. That's a scene in Nintendogs.

224
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:04,020
and ten dogs that we needed. And ten dogs where your puppy gets, you know, rabies. Gotta

225
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:11,260
put him down, son. Alright, Paul, let me do it! Moving on, Loki, you have some news about

226
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,620
another very popular RPG. Yeah, Oblivion's getting yet another add-on, which is excellent.

227
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:35,620
The new add-on is basically a quest that revolves around finding a powerful mage who has set off in search of the Daedric artifact, Mephruun's Razor.

228
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:44,620
And basically the razor has the ability to instantly kill enemies and the mage intends to use it to overthrow the empire.

229
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,260
It's up to you to make sure that you find it first so it doesn't fall into the wrong

230
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
hands.

231
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,740
Basically this download is going to be the most expensive download yet coming in at $2.99

232
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,340
for the PC users.

233
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:05,980
No price yet on the Xbox Live Marketplace but it's assumed to be about the same.

234
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,220
It's supposed to give you a massive, massive dungeon to be able to go through as well as

235
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,180
adding 17 new magic items and a ton of new books.

236
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,380
And also, might add though, if you do happen to find the item, you get to keep it.

237
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,340
So it's a death to everybody!

238
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,900
Alright, going to another very popular, this one an MMO, World of Warcraft.

239
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,340
I don't actually have a lot of news about the actual game itself, but there is a trading

240
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,900
card game that's coming out, they're going to do a card game, it's actually Upper Deck

241
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,700
that's doing it, they're doing a game based on World of Warcraft.

242
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,780
So the cool thing about doing the card game is that now since the video game has been

243
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,180
out a little while, they can make some references in the card game from the computer game phenomenon

244
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
in the community.

245
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,120
And of course one of those things is Leroy Jenkins, and Leroy Jenkins is getting his

246
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,580
own card.

247
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:09,160
And just to further cool this off, coolify, I don't know how to say it, the Gabe of Penny

248
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,840
Arcade did the artwork.

249
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,440
actually I can show I know this doesn't make for very good radio but I can show

250
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,240
you guys here in studio and I'll post this in chat a picture

251
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,080
what the card looks like and if you look at the card you can actually see it

252
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,000
looks like you know the warrior he's got the big sword and he's foaming at the

253
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,960
mouth like ready to go into battle because if you know the story of Leroy

254
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:38,240
Jenkins it kind of fits so that's pretty funny so that's just kind of neat to

255
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,140
show that the whole like cyber cult culture can kind of you know get into

256
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,240
the game there so breaking down that fourth wall all right anyway um speaking

257
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,360
of breaking down the fourth wall we let you do that here on our program don't we

258
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,640
dark Sakura in such an amazingly fantastic way yes we love being

259
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,600
interactive and one of the ways we get you guys to participate in our program

260
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,640
is we welcome your emails and you can email us on just about anything mailbag

261
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,520
at orange lounge radio comm is the place to send those emails and once a week

262
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,880
Jamie puts on her hazmat suit and dives in the mailbag and pulls out some of her favorites that hopefully do not have anthrax in

263
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
them

264
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,560
Let's hope not this time. I don't need any more disease

265
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,640
All right who emailed us this week first one is Mac man from DreamStation CC. I know what's coming. Yeah

266
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,640
Apple runs Microsoft on their computers. We all have Microsoft programs on our Macs even your goddamn games. Oh

267
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Oh, and for only print media thing, iLife, iMovie, iDVD, iTunes, GarageBand, and iPhoto,

268
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,200
where is your god now?

269
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,120
The sign by MacMan, I who have superb taste in computers, unlike Loki, he the one.

270
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,960
Okay, so they have programs to do the same things that PCs do, but they're not better

271
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
than PCs.

272
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Can't we all just get along?

273
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,360
I mean seriously, this fucking debate's been going on for like six months.

274
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
It's done.

275
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Hey!

276
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
It's alright.

277
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
It's okay.

278
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,400
I understand, okay, maybe Macs don't have as many games.

279
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,600
it doesn't matter Mac users don't like games so that's that's fine

280
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,720
I'm getting a Mac and I like games

281
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,160
but the magazine said

282
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,560
buy and use whatever makes you happy

283
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,240
there you go it's your money, spend it on whatever you want

284
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,640
and I bought an iBook and I love it and Loki you can just

285
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,200
if you don't like that you can kiss my butt

286
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,720
I want a Macbook with a docking station and a new monitor instead of an iMac

287
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
And there's better ones coming out.

288
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
But anyway, let's...

289
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Macbook is hot.

290
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
I know.

291
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Let's keep it moving.

292
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Okay.

293
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Um, got a message from David.

294
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,760
Um, I found this thing on Google Video by accident.

295
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,560
It's a video of a group of people who put together a play of the first level of the

296
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,680
original Mario Brothers.

297
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,780
The music was a little off-timing at some parts, but I thought it was pretty funny.

298
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,640
It'd also be pretty awesome if you guys could do a Flash website for the PSP.

299
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
I'm working on it.

300
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,320
I think the problem with Flash on the PSP right now is it's slow.

301
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
It's only Flash 2.0.

302
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,480
Yeah, it's slow.

303
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Which I don't really know... I started working with Flash 8, so...

304
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Urge Sony to get their Flash a little better, and then we'll look into it.

305
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,480
I planned on playing with it, but honestly I don't know too much about the older versions of Flash to make it work right now.

306
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
We'll have to do a Wii website when it comes out, because they have Opera in it.

307
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,480
It supports Opera 9, which is the newest Opera browser right now.

308
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Make sure you'll get E3 on Wii!

309
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,480
We'll see. Yeah, E3 and PSP, I don't know if I'll want to do that next year. We'll see, we'll see.

310
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Um, I also got one from Roble. It says, cue the 8-bit sound effects.

311
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,480
He linked me a story that's talking about, and this is on Wired News.

312
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Strap up and jump like Mario.

313
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,800
The Nintendo amusement park is by the same group of New York University students who did

314
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,160
The pack Manhattan they were well actually is in the the same big games class

315
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,720
The pack Manhattan was a recreation of pac-man using the streets of New York with like Central Park being in the ghost area

316
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:16,620
But now they're doing an amusement park where you strap yourselves in and basically you jump through a recreation of the first level Super Mario Brothers

317
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,780
brothers with hooks and everything is because Mario can jump four times the normal you know

318
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,280
height of a person you get to jump four times the normal height and you get to stomp on

319
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,080
things and run over them but the article is on wirednews.com I'll link it in the chat

320
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,120
room anyone else is going to have to hunt it down but it's pretty cool it looks like

321
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,200
it's fun actually the author here said that the game just a quote here the game is a lot

322
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,760
fun and a serious workout while I wasn't in physical pain it felt like I had run

323
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,480
a couple of miles so it actually looks like it's pretty good they're talking

324
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,080
about how to basically do video game physics in real life and I thought it

325
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,120
was a pretty cool application it's a little silly but whatever well no I

326
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,060
think we can all get a little silly some I think it's a pretty fun idea and like

327
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,680
the thing that they said was gonna be at e3 next year which wasn't quite as cool

328
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,900
so um to the next email I got one another one from actually no that's the

329
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:30,140
same one got one from spoon as opposed to fork it's three O's okay so hi I've

330
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,940
been listening to your podcast for about four months and it's good stuff good to

331
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,460
hear the different takes and the fact one of you he shall remain unnamed

332
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,460
hates Max so much.

333
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
He's supposed to be

334
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,460
unnamed. I named him.

335
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Max and Nintendo

336
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
go hand in hand, build

337
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
a machine that can do what it's set out

338
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
for correctly. Nintendo equals gameplay.

339
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Max equals work.

340
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,460
I wanted to share with you another

341
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
podcast. Loki just bites your tongue.

342
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
He actually just linked us to another

343
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
podcast that talks about DDR. It's called

344
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
AskANinja.com. Oh, I've

345
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
heard of Ask A Ninja. They're really popular.

346
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,980
It's actually I think they're a video cast actually so they are and it's awesome is that I didn't see the DDR episode

347
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:15,180
Oh, I haven't seen that either, but I I don't know. I always said that if we ever like, you know

348
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,180
There was ever a new video game channel that they would have to put them in as like a segment

349
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,860
How much does it cost to start a TV channel? We should start one. Somebody would give us a loan, right?

350
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
Um, no, all right

351
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,560
I'll be you can sell ads or something if you don't want to be on it

352
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
I'll be Ninja Sakura.

353
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Ask a Ninja, there you go. Ask a female Ninja.

354
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Ask a Kunoichi.

355
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Alright, anyway.

356
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
So we got one on our MySpace from Sergo.

357
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,560
I guess that's pronounced.

358
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Hello there OrangeLunchRadio, how are you doing on this fine Friday afternoon?

359
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Huh, two days late.

360
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

361
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,560
I sent you this message to ask if you three would honor me on your input on Luminesce Mobile.

362
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,560
I have the game and I absolutely am in love with it.

363
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,000
many fans out there do not even

364
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,240
i guess no of this game, he missed the word no

365
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,680
of this game's existence

366
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,680
which makes me sad this is also a chance for many out there who do not own a PSP

367
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,960
to finally experience the genius of this game

368
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,600
thank you for taking the time to read this and keep kicking ass

369
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
those of you that listen to the show know i am not a big fan of mobile gaming

370
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,440
but i am a huge fan of luminous i'll check it out i don't know if my carrier

371
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,160
offers it though i have sprint

372
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,260
who's kinda like the black sheep of the cell phone carrier so i don't even know if they

373
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,140
have luminous but I'll check it out if it's out there. I didn't even know my game can

374
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,460
play phones or play it and play games. Your phone can play games? Yeah there's a little

375
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,220
dyslexic there. I don't know if my phone can, I imagine it can but I haven't tried because

376
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,500
you know god knows how expensive that would be to download it. I'll check your ear and

377
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,740
x-ray cause I'm serious. I saw a review on it and the guy that reviewed it said he liked

378
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,660
it and that it, I mean it looked very similar. The only thing they didn't like is that the

379
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:55,040
music's not like mp3 it's no bleep bleep can't be yeah yeah it's also it's MIDI

380
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,720
and yeah it's not very midi-tastic alrighty I got one more email actually I

381
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,000
got this to my own box jamie at orange house radio calm okay I'm just gonna

382
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,560
paraphrase this a little bit but um it's a from a guy named Chris over who is a

383
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,760
contributor to weebl stuff calm who was our website of the week last week as I

384
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I was going to say, that was two weeks ago, right?

385
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Two weeks ago, yeah.

386
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
That's your website of the week, yeah.

387
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Yep.

388
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Wow, so somebody heard it.

389
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Apparently, he listens to our podcast, is a big fan.

390
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,920
In fact, he says on here that it seems none of the other guys on the staff listens to

391
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,480
OLR to their great detriment, of course, I thought I should say a big thanks for giving

392
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
us a plug.

393
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,840
I've been a fan of OLR for a long time now, and I've got to say you guys are consistently

394
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,880
among the best independent gaming podcasts.

395
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,320
I appreciate that you bothered to mention UK, European games news and release dates.

396
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,320
I sometimes suspect you guys are the only American games media outlet who are even aware

397
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,280
of this little continent's existence.

398
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,800
I had replied back though, I'm actually not reading my own email, but basically I don't

399
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:06,520
think that with a lot of the content now coming out of the US and a bit out of Japan, at least

400
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,280
for the more niche market, I really think that the rest of the world sort of gets overlooked.

401
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Gamers are everywhere.

402
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,840
We got our person from Serbia who e-mailed us. I thought it was great.

403
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,240
Right.

404
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,560
You know, I want to make sure that because we have listeners everywhere that, you know,

405
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,800
it's not just United States. It's everywhere. We have listeners in Canada. We have listeners

406
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,520
in Japan. We have listeners in China. I found that out.

407
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,920
Wow. Cool.

408
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:43,400
We have listeners all over Europe, UK, we want to make sure that you're a gamer too,

409
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,160
we want your voice heard just as well, we want to get you the news, if it's happening

410
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,600
in your area of the world, if we don't know about it, let us know, we'll mention it.

411
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,160
I know one of our listeners started a Frapper map a while back, we want to see where you

412
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,040
you guys are so please take a minute to stop by its frappr.com and then just search for

413
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,960
Orange Lounge and put a pin on the map so we can see where our listeners are cause that's

414
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,500
kind of cool like it's just kind of neat knowing where all you guys are.

415
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I would really like.

416
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,320
Even if you're in the US cause it maps that too.

417
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,800
I would really like though for our listeners to I'd like to have a thread on our forums

418
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,100
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com go to the forums link on the left side of the page.

419
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,140
Let us know where you're from let us know where you're listening from you know it'd

420
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,660
It'd be really cool just to put, you know, names.

421
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,740
You know, we don't want to think of, you know, just statistics, you know.

422
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,360
Because all we see are numbers when we look at our stat pages, we want to know who you

423
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,380
are, you know, why you listen to us, you know.

424
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,500
I love hearing from our listeners everywhere.

425
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,960
I think it's fantastic.

426
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,660
All right.

427
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
You say that was last one?

428
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,620
That was last one.

429
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,420
I saved the last one for last.

430
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
All right.

431
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,660
That's the way to do it.

432
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
All right.

433
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,500
You can ask us whatever, and as long as it's clean, we'll answer it during the show.

434
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,020
Thanks a lot, those of you who email us.

435
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
And if it's dirty, I'll save it.

436
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,100
Alright, she'll bookmark it.

437
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,460
Loki, back into some news, some more Sony antics.

438
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:18,260
I swear to God, in the last few days, if this guy David Reeves says anything, it's always

439
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,500
something retarded and crazy.

440
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,500
This one though, I'm not hating on Sony, but he's the one that's saying it. Basically,

441
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,480
his quote is this. Market share? Not that important. Who needs market share? Consoles

442
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,480
don't need market share. Anyways, the name of the game is not market share. It's how

443
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:46,000
fast we can grow the industry. Our ambition is to grow 15% a year on hardware and software

444
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
if we can, we want to try and double digital entertainment in the next 5-6 years whether

445
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:01,000
we have 40-50 or 60% of the market share that's not that important. Well, here's a little

446
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,720
thing to kind of be scared about, what he said here. They want to double the digital

447
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,040
entertainment world. They didn't say game world, they said digital entertainment. So

448
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,820
what do you think the focus of the PS3 is going to be? It's sure as hell not games,

449
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,100
It's that stupid Blu-ray drive.

450
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,580
They want to push the next gen thing because, you know what, imagine if you will, they're

451
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,660
the ones that come up with the technology for Blu-ray, they want, or like DVDs, if they

452
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,380
had been the pioneers of DVDs and stuff, they want to make all the money they can off their

453
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,780
stupid format.

454
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,360
So I don't know.

455
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,540
I think it's kind of scary that he's saying that, but in the same respect, I think that

456
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,620
40, 50, and 60 percent of the market share is a bit ambitious seeing as your console

457
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,820
costs $600.

458
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,700
Let's try to concentrate on getting some market share before you concentrate on getting more

459
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,860
than Xbox or Nintendo.

460
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,860
I don't know.

461
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,280
I find the whole story just a little odd.

462
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,060
It's just an odd thing to say.

463
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,500
Well, this is the same guy.

464
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,580
He was saying that, you know, who cares?

465
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,500
gamers will just have to pay more for their system because you'll buy whatever it is.

466
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,460
Even if the system didn't come out with games, you'll buy it because it's Sony.

467
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,260
This is the same jackass that said that.

468
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,340
What they need to do is shut him up because he's seeing really stupid stuff.

469
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,100
Moving on to more Sony related news, there's a new controller coming out for the PlayStation

470
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,420
2 and PC.

471
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,540
It's a tilt controller.

472
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:40,680
It's the E-Dimensional G-Pad Pro Gyroscopic Game Pad, and it has tilt-sensing technology,

473
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,520
and it's the same thing that the PlayStation 3 has.

474
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,840
It's coming out for the PC and the PlayStation 2.

475
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,180
By the way, though, it also has rumble, but didn't Sony say...

476
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,520
Now, Sony's not putting this out, but didn't Sony say that they can't do rumble in the

477
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,840
tilt thing because it'll mess it up?

478
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,480
Apparently not true, according to the folks behind the G-Pad Gyroscopic Game Pad, so obviously

479
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:12,260
this is just a lawsuit related issue here so very interesting. Of course I don't know

480
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,720
what the point is for this coming out. PC I could see but PlayStation 2 games don't

481
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,720
really support it so you'd have to kind of use the feature in other games. I don't know

482
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,960
you'd have to you know add the feature on to other games. It just doesn't make sense

483
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,640
really. I think it might have a use on the PC where it can be easily thrown into flight

484
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,040
simulators and types of genres that are more popular on the PC, but I don't know so much

485
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,840
about PS2, that's kind of weird.

486
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,040
DarkSakura, we had a letter in the mailbag about a mobile game, you have some news that

487
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,520
kind of affects another one?

488
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,040
I sure do.

489
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:52,900
Dirge of Cerberus for mobile is actually called Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode, which is one

490
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,280
of the Final Fantasy 7 titles coming out, and it's going to be on Amped Mobile for three

491
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,620
months starting in the summer actually there's no word on if it's going to be

492
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:11,500
out for the for the UK but it's at least we're gonna get it in the summer for a

493
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:17,720
little bit I'm probably not going to play it I mean it's a mobile game I'm

494
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,260
not really big on the mobile games the only reason I would even consider

495
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,500
getting it is because I was a major Vincent fan girl but other than that no

496
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,500
You know, I played through Final Fantasy 7 and I never even got Vincent.

497
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,500
What a loss. I actually got him without using an FAQ or anything.

498
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Well, you know, in Final Fantasy, because I played Final Fantasy 7 when it first came out, you know,

499
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:44,500
as you guys, I'm an older gamer, so there wasn't really the whole gamefaqs.com didn't really exist then.

500
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I found him by accident and just randomly asked the right questions.

501
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
I also got Yuffie right the first time.

502
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Wait, no, no, no. Yuffie's the one you asked the questions to. Vincent wasn't safe.

503
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,060
Vincent you still had to do well I never got see I never did the safe you have to

504
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,020
answer the right thing from see I never figured out the safe but so I got both

505
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,340
both Yuffie and Vincent that's funny Yuffie I figured out just through trial

506
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,660
and error she showed up once you keep stealing your crap yeah and I kept

507
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,460
running around that same forest like until she finally joined my damn party

508
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,660
but I asked I somehow or the other managed to ask the right questions the

509
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:23,500
first time hmm all right Loki has some news about the way items are packaged

510
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,820
Yeah, I hate this. I just read it blister packaging. You gotta love it

511
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,600
It basically if you don't know what that is, if you've ever seen anything, especially nowadays any game peripheral or anything out there

512
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,220
It's that hard packaging that is goddamn impossible to open without killing yourself

513
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:51,100
I mean, I know for a fact trying to open the Xbox 360 accessories and stuff. I that stuff's like glass

514
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,640
It's really scary, but I'm actually it's funny because wired news did a little

515
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,220
article here called tales from packaging hell and basically

516
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,120
The whole thing behind the packaging is that you know, it's meant to avoid

517
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:15,980
You know obviously theft but a lot of people have like really gotten hurt by this and they have some pictures actually of you know

518
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,060
people with

519
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,460
Major gashes on their hands and just you know people being sent to the hospital

520
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
You know this one guy

521
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,460
George from was it George looks like Monroe from Atlanta

522
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,780
Sliced his hand open and there's a that's about an inch long gash

523
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:41,020
I mean, that's some serious like cry I've damn near killed myself on that packaging. I mean, it's it's why

524
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,300
It doesn't pop open.

525
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,940
I mean, granted, people can't steal the stuff out of it.

526
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
Okay, that's great.

527
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,940
But you know what?

528
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,740
Normal packaging can do the same thing.

529
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,880
When it takes me like 10 minutes, I really, you can't use scissors, because scissors aren't

530
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,580
sharp enough to get through this, so you have to use a knife, and you have to stab it in

531
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:07,060
there, and the knife, most of the time, if it's relatively dull or if it's not as sharp

532
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,540
as it can be, it'll slip, and it'll cut yourself the knife.

533
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,580
Even if you manage to do get it open, the edges are really sharp and jaggedy, and it's

534
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,900
like cutting open glass, and basically, I don't know, a lot of people go to the hospital

535
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,380
because of this stuff, and I wouldn't doubt it, I mean, it's just, it's scary stuff.

536
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,620
Alright, that packaging makes me angry, I don't know about you, but it makes me angry

537
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,260
and it makes me want to rant, doesn't it make you want to rant, DarkSakura?

538
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,460
Can't you put stuff in boxes like they used to?

539
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,620
mean seriously cardboard boxes just as effective you know low-key get past it

540
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm trying to get to the next segment

541
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:56,900
the FUs of the week time dark Sakura start us off my FU of the week goes

542
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:04,780
toward it's a number of people who have it's actually a misconception I'm gonna

543
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,540
put my F.U. of the week toward you know like I've said at the beginning of the

544
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,620
last segment I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome which is why I

545
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,740
was really sick with what I call the plague in November and December and have

546
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,540
been you know consistently not feeling well there's people who say oh well

547
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:30,540
you'll be just fine when you get back from your medical need no that's not how

548
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:37,060
it works it's just it's something that a lot of people think is either an all in

549
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,100
your head sort of thing you know or something that you can just fix with a

550
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,860
drug or something that if you just sleep a lot you'll get over it but the whole

551
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,980
thing about is that no matter how much sleep you get you still feel tired you

552
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,660
feel like you haven't slept you go through phases of being really hungry

553
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,860
and then not being hungry at all and nothing you will ever make you feel

554
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,620
satisfied if you're in one of those phases you feel like your muscles hurt all the time

555
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,580
and for anyone who thinks that it's just an all in your head type of thing fuck you okay

556
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,540
you know it's it's a fully diagnosed thing it's something that they you know you have

557
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:18,900
to rule out physical factors before they diagnose you with it but taking a nap doesn't help you know

558
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,420
i've been sleeping for upwards of 10 hours a day you know while i've been on my medical leave and

559
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,300
it still hasn't helped hardly any I get to learn how to give myself shots on

560
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,880
Wednesday though which is not fun but yeah so for anyone who thinks that it's

561
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,380
you know an all in your head sort of thing and that you know a little rest

562
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,320
or some vitamins will you know help you get over it it may help but it's not the

563
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,000
cure so stop telling me that I'll feel better when my leave is up because I

564
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,920
don't think I will.

565
00:36:48,920 --> 00:37:01,920
Mokey. Couple things. First off, fuck you to Christopher for the smell that's coming from his desk, and I'm gonna guess it's from these three empty McFlurry containers which are probably rotting right now.

566
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,920
That's a really nasty, like, rotten milk smell that's... ugh. Anyways, so fuck you to that.

567
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,420
Fucking the stupid people that are in my apartment complex who are parking their car in the middle of the parking lot

568
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,720
Just basically just in the middle because they're talking to a friend or something like that

569
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,420
I fucking hate people that do that shit

570
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,420
Get out of your goddamn car or park it if you need to talk to somebody

571
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,420
Or you know what, do what everybody else does, talk on your damn cell phone

572
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,920
I'm sure whatever you're telling them is not that important and you do not need to be blocking my path

573
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,420
So, fuck you

574
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:47,420
And then finally, I don't know, I'm just talking to you and being hungry, oh, and fucking needles, because every time I get poked with a needle by a doctor, I almost pass out.

575
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,420
You know, it's not necessarily medication or something, but my body goes into shock whenever I have a needle.

576
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,420
No tattoos for loci.

577
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,420
So yeah, that sucks.

578
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,420
My F.U. goes to this humongous zit that's on my face right now that won't go away no matter what I put on it

579
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Because it makes me feel really ugly and sad

580
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
No matter what I put on it part

581
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,420
Because it makes me feel ugly and sad and makes me not want to be social

582
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Because I feel... I feel ugly

583
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,420
That it'll go away

584
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
And then I'll be pretty again

585
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Alright, anyway, let's move on to another story

586
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:30,420
Story, Loki, it's all you.

587
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,020
I'm wondering if this shouldn't have been before the FUs, but anyways, higher prices

588
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:41,340
for games for the Playstation 3 and the Wii are confirmed by Atari.

589
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,260
And actually Atari is the distributor for Sega in some parts of Europe, so it's basically

590
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
some of the Sega games.

591
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:57,180
Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3 for example is going to cost 67.99 euros while some of

592
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:05,940
the games like World Snooker Championship 2007 will be 73.99 euros.

593
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,300
And basically on the Wii, Sonic Wildfire and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz will both be

594
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:20,300
be available for 59.99 euros and it's a lot more than what we've got to pay for them.

595
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Sorry.

596
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Damn, Texas.

597
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,300
All right.

598
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,540
Microsoft made a pretty interesting statement this week.

599
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,920
It was Chris Lewis who works for Microsoft was speaking about Sony's online service

600
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,380
saying I'm flattered that they followed our clear direction.

601
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,940
Plagiarism is a good thing.

602
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,900
That in itself isn't such a problem.

603
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,860
That's what the market wants, but we've known that's what the market wanted all along.

604
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,040
So that, by the way, was in an interview with Eurogamer.

605
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,060
So Microsoft kind of taking a swing there that PlayStation 3 is just downright copying

606
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
them.

607
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
Interesting.

608
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,700
But again, you know, you kind of expect that you're going to get copied in some elements,

609
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
but whatever.

610
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,020
Loki, you have some news about Wii web browsing.

611
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Yes.

612
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,440
Opera, of course, as everybody knows, is going to be the web browser on the Wii.

613
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,400
And they've actually released some information of what this is going to support and some

614
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,680
of the details on it.

615
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:23,800
First off, Opera will be embedded on the Wii's Flash ROM, unlike the DS version which is

616
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,080
actually a cart based operating system.

617
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,800
The browser will or may take advantage of some of the gesture based navigation interaction

618
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,260
that's available with the Wii controller, so that would be kind of interesting.

619
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,300
And no advertisements will be included within the browser, however, you shouldn't rule out

620
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,220
that there won't be in-game advertising delivered via Opera.

621
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,500
But I think that's pretty interesting.

622
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,860
Another thing that someone's bringing up about the Dreamcast browser is that they had special

623
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,980
features for, like when you're programming web pages, you can actually make the Dreamcast

624
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,940
VMU rumble or display things.

625
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,380
I think that'd be really cool if they added that kind of to the Wii browser where you

626
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:13,380
can make the controller rumbler special tags or something to use the Wii controller. Something

627
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,780
to think about. That's a little weird. And it's also basically going to be compatible

628
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:27,780
with Opera 9 which is the one that's out currently right now. So it is supposed to support most

629
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:34,980
everything including Java so like they said in the interview here it looks like it's based

630
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:41,980
on Opera 9 for devices, and it will include the latest technology, including AJAX.

631
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:50,740
Hmm. Cool. Alrighty. Dark Sakura. Something we've had here for a long time, but it's coming

632
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,380
out to Japan. This is a little backwards from what it usually is.

633
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:02,580
Actually, yeah, there's going to be game rentals in Japan. It actually started on the third.

634
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:13,340
Basically Koei will put out its first rent-a-net video store at the Taito Game Center in Kanagawa.

635
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:20,180
Basically it's not, there's not any real rental franchises like we have here, not like Blockbuster

636
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,800
or anything, so this is a very, very new thing there.

637
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:30,760
New games will basically rent for 2,800 yen, which is 2,450 over here for five days.

638
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,380
then you bring them back $24 that's expensive everything is more expensive in

639
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,940
Japan all right I just want to say real quick I had to correct something I said

640
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,340
earlier funny Dale actually in chat room corrected me on something I said about

641
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,220
game facts wasn't around when Final Fantasy 7 it actually started in 1995 so

642
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,540
they actually were around it's just not a lot of people knew about them including

643
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,460
me but certainly they weren't you know the site they are now then it's been a

644
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,600
long time. I actually use them for Super Nintendo stuff back in the day. That's crazy. I used

645
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,600
eBay when they first came out, but back when they were, well not back when they were PEZ

646
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,100
dispensers, but just after that, before they got all commercialized, I bought Super Metroid

647
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:17,340
on eBay like in 97. So, anyway, websites were different back then, because browsers weren't

648
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,120
the same. Anyway, one more story here guys, and we're going to go to our Skype line over

649
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,680
at orangelaunchradio.com, click on and interact with us, Loki, what's up?

650
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:33,680
Yes, a British, what was it, the SCI, some British publication was saying that they're

651
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,920
going to be extending Eidos's licenses for Hitman and Tomb Raider to the gambling franchises,

652
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,600
including online and, I don't know, you're basically going to see some video slot machines

653
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:55,200
based on both Lara Croft and Agent 47 and yeah I guess that's interesting. You should

654
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,840
know though that they're still going to steal your money just as well as all the other video

655
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:08,640
slot machines out there so yeah. Unfortunately no boobies in the slot machines either. Sorry.

656
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,240
Alright. I don't know I can't get too excited about slot machines because I personally hate

657
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,360
those video slot machines, I think that they're a big waste of money, especially the nickel

658
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
ones.

659
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,000
It's just, you have to put more nickels in, that's all, you know, instead of quarters.

660
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,280
You know, more of the same, whatever.

661
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Alright.

662
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,040
We're going to go head on over to our Skype line if you guys want to call in and talk

663
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,040
about anything.

664
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,400
It's www.orangelogister.com, click on interact with us, or you can give us a call, 916-226-9067,

665
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,280
and that phone number is open during the entire week.

666
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,960
just so you know, that isn't a toll-free number. You may have to ask your parents'

667
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,400
permission or whoever owns the phone line before you call.

668
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,440
And we're getting a phone call right now, let's go to our first call tonight. Hello,

669
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,160
you're on Orange Launch Radio.

670
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,400
Hello. Hi, who's this? This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

671
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,760
Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64. You're a little quiet, but what's on your mind?

672
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh, well, it's probably because I'm actually using my regular phone. I don't know, my mic jack died on my laptop.

673
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,760
That's weird. Well, get out your thoughts anyway. Okay, anyway,

674
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,760
Okay, I have an announcement to make. Let me see if I can load up my test. Okay, here we go.

675
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:23,760
From Game 7 to 10, I'm going to be in New York City. Since we're getting an art award for this archery season,

676
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:33,760
I'll be at the Nintendo World Store on Friday at 11 AM. So, if you're looking for something out there,

677
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,360
me if you want. You know what's with me? I'll be wearing that pancake bling. I'll be wearing

678
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:47,480
a shirt with that. I have a topic here on the forum. More details. I'll get you a small

679
00:45:47,480 --> 00:46:00,160
link for it. xrl.us slash nz5. That's it. And I can also put it in chat if you want.

680
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,360
I think I heard about half of that because of the connection we have here.

681
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Let me get this right.

682
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,580
You said you're going to be at the Nintendo store on Friday and you want to meet other

683
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,280
listeners of the show or something?

684
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
Sure.

685
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
At like 11 a.m.

686
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
At 11 a.m.

687
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,380
And what are you going to be wearing?

688
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,960
I'm going to be wearing a shirt with the pancake bunny on.

689
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Oh, Oolong.

690
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,960
Oh, Oolong the pancake bunny.

691
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
Okay, yeah.

692
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Poor dead bunny.

693
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Dude, that guy rocks.

694
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,520
Then just in case if somebody missed it, it's xrl.us slash mz5k.

695
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,320
All right.

696
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,900
I'm glad you could use this program to help make yourself more friends in person.

697
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Have fun at the store.

698
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,900
Okay.

699
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,900
All right.

700
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,900
Thank you.

701
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
All right.

702
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,900
I'm letting you go now because your connection sucks.

703
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,900
All right.

704
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,900
All right.

705
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,900
Take care, buddy.

706
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,900
See you.

707
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,900
All right.

708
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,020
So much for that.

709
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,300
I want to go meet listeners.

710
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,300
Oh, well.

711
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,820
We did that last week.

712
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,820
Yeah, we did.

713
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,140

Let's go to another call.

720
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,300
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

721
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,660
Good evening, all arts, DMN, how are ya?

722
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,860
Good, oh, your connection's much better than the last guy.

723
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,420
What's on your mind, DMN?

724
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,320
Well, as you announced earlier,

725
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,900
I had that little contest of exclusive Zelda questions.

726
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,900
That's right! Did you get a winner?

727
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,900
I did. T23M is the winner.

728
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,900
Uh-huh. Oh!

729
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,900
That's 23 Vegas.

730
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,900
He should be disqualified, because he comes on the show once.

731
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
No, I'm kidding. Let him have it.

732
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,900
He's a local.

733
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,900
But yeah, going back to jumping release dates.

734
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:51,900
I've heard that Nintendo's practice is generally they give those offending retailers shipments late or very low shipments later on.

735
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,580
later on. So I don't... Beg your pardon? Do you think Nintendo is going to give a company

736
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:05,580
like Target a big spanking? I think so, because I remember Microsoft released Project Gotham

737
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:11,700
2, I believe it was, a couple of days early, and they got beat down for it. I recall that

738
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,460
they got Halo 2, a very low shipment of Halo 2, I think a half shipment of Halo 2 in each

739
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:26,460
store um wow so i think i think uh target's going to be in big trouble for uh releasing the ds light

740
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:32,540
early but on the other side hey you know we can get some ds lights they're already out there and

741
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,500
word of mouth i'm sure travels and it kind of created a sudden surge of interest a little bit

742
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,580
on the blogs while people frantically hunted these down so i don't think the news is all bad for

743
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,460
for Nintendo here. Oh no, not at all. I can actually tell you first hand, the DS Lite

744
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:52,540
is awesome. Somebody brought one to the E3 Outpost that they had imported. I want to

745
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:59,500
say the guy that we invited who called in. That was SilentWind. That's right, he had

746
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,900
one. I think he brought it to show us. Yeah. They also had them on the demo's E3. I'm looking

747
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:11,420
at mine right now, it looks pretty nice. Rub it in. Alright, now did you go to a target

748
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:14,240
to get it or do you get it from a special like you were for Nintendo your

749
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,280
special thing I actually got mine from an import store

750
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:24,620
Nintendo just got theirs in gotcha okay all right well anything else you want to

751
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,120

761
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,980
the one that's paying the bills and Nintendo maniac 64 is yelling at me in

762
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,620
chat because I was dissing his call a little bit there saying he was using the

763
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:15,820
phone so unfortunately if your phone is kind of quiet usually it's gonna come

764
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,740
across quiet here I know cell phones sometimes have a lot of problems but it

765
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,800
just all depends on the connection you know how it goes sometimes so just wait

766
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,700
and see here if we get any more phone calls if not we'll just go ahead and

767
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,000
wrap things up for tonight does anybody have any last-minute stories they want

768
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,780
to share Loki or dark soccer any last-minute stories for our listeners I

769
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,340
I was just going to talk really quickly about Forza 2, because there are some updates on

770
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:45,260
IGN about it, including that it's going to be built using a completely new 360 engine.

771
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:50,060
This isn't Forza 1 in HD, nice little slap at Sony there.

772
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,780
Forza 2 is going to run at 60 frames per second with reflection mapping on all the cars running

773
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,260
at 60 frames per second as well.

774
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:02,300
It's going to support the new wireless racing wheel, feature 60 tracks, 18 environments,

775
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:09,740
real-world license circuits and will feature over 300 cars and from more than

776
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:15,620
50 of the world's leading manufacturers including Ferrari, Porsche, Nissan, VW, GM

777
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:21,380
and Lamborghini to name a few. Forza will allow people to customize

778
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:27,860
their cars to a new degree of stylization including alternative

779
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:34,060
engines, suspension kits, bolt-on superchargers, brakes, rims, racing slicks,

780
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:40,320
and work on advanced suspension settings, tire pressure, and gear ratios. So it

781
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:45,500
sounds like Gran Turismo to the extreme, seriously. Anybody else have any other

782
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,220
last-minute stories? All right, well our chat room is feeling a little shy

783
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,940
tonight because we're not getting any of their calls and neither anybody else

784
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,800
listening out there, so. I was gonna mention one more thing here, so I'm

785
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,240
mention this in the chatroom and I apologize for not knowing who it was or not remembering.

786
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,760
HappyHardcore.com mentioned that they're going to have a couple songs in the upcoming DDR

787
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,440
Universe and UltraMix 4.

788
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:15,800
Including UltraMix 4 is going to be Fracas featuring Lisa Abbott, Desire the Comet remix,

789
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:24,520
and also on Universe, the Acolyte with Treble, Bass, and Attitude, which is going to be a

790
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,020
Eurotrance song and triple bass and attitude is actually the one that's on

791
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:38,940
the official trailer for universe so kind of neat that's yeah I think that's

792
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,180
all the news I had all right I'll actually we are getting a call so let's

793
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,420
go and take this hi you're on Orange Lounge radio oh you got you you probably

794
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:54,220
know who this is long time yes hello legend of Zaku what's on your mind

795
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,820
Nah, I just came back from Europe yesterday.

796
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,220
Ooh, how are things over in Europe?

797
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,920
Expensive.

798
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,220
Don't tell me you flew over there just to play Supernova.

799
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,620
Nah, I'd barely seen Supernova where I was at in Spain.

800
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,620
And through parts of Paris and Milan and Rome.

801
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,220
That's right, wait, you're of Spanish descent, right?

802
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:16,020
I'm a Peruvian, actually, but we do have family in Spain.

803
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,620
My bad.

804
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:21,020
I thought I remember in a previous episode you saying something about that, but

805
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,120
whoa, what is wrong with your connection? Stop.

806
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,000
You got some weird thing going on there with your mic

807
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,880
Fix it. What's on your mind?

808
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,520
Now for some reason you said that Supernova was supposed to come out

809
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,920
last mid-May which was a couple weeks before

810
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,840
you know before I actually made the trip out. Yep. Came back nothing

811
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,040
you know it doesn't seem to me that nothing has appeared

812
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,160
by now you know if it did come out like

813
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,160
like Konami said they would. I would see

814
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,640
about you know about all the songs

815
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,400
from each part of the country. Okay here it is here it is

816
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,520
it probably got pushed back is anyone really surprised?

817
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,360
Games get pushed back all the time. So

818
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:13,040
wouldn't it be prudent to just make that correction? To just say that you know it

819
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,040
might have been released last May or

820
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,360
because of what I'm hearing. With arcade games it's usually not the same thing as

821
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,320
console because you are not the one that purchases an arcade game the arcade

822
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,080
owners do

823
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,720
so to come on the fans I don't know I just it's a little different when we're

824
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,040
talking about console games I think versus

825
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,200
arcade games yeah I guess

826
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,440
yeah yeah just just to keep that in mind

827
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,360
I understand where you come from. Somebody in Sephiroth1215 is yelling out it's mid June now

828
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,840
so I guess we'll see yeah that's what it was saying

829
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:49,160
and let me see so far

830
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,520
Did I miss anything in the past two weeks? Any gaming news?

831
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,780
We took some video of the Ultramix stuff and universe stuff at E3 and it's on

832
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,560
YouTube if you search for OLR

833
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,760
and I don't know. Go listen to our old podcast!

834
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,280
Check it out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you'll get caught up on all your gaming news.

835
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,520
Yeah. Would you like that plug? Yeah. One more thing, stuff in Europe is

836
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,040
hella expensive. Even DDR games

837
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,600
But you know heroes about a buck third. Oh

838
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,320
All right, Zach. Oh, I'm hanging up on you. You're breaking up. I'm sorry to hear it was so expensive

839
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,640
All right, we had fun though. You lucky bastard least you get to travel

840
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,280
Yeah, all righty

841
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,960
He said everything's more expensive over there is kind of what I picked up from that. I forgot we have a voicemail

842
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,400
I have to play to us. We'll play that in a moment. But let's do some more calls here real quick

843
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,280
Micaiah, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

844
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,600
Hey, what's up, man?

845
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,600
This is Bandit.

846
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,600
Hello, Bandit.

847
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,600
What's on your mind?

848
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,800
Hey, that last guy that was just talking about the Supernova?

849
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Yep.

850
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,520
Well, I called Bets and Air Prizes last week, and they actually told me it's shipping the

851
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,160
last two weeks of June.

852
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,800
You went right to the horse's mouth.

853
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,760
Yeah, I actually called the number that was on Konami's website, and they forwarded me

854
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,800
to a guy who handles the machines in the Pittsburgh area.

855
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,400
Now do you work for an arcade or are you just a crazed fan?

856
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,720
No, maybe a little bit, but you know what I used to?

857
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,720
A hardcore fan.

858
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:29,040
I got rid of the local arcade and he went ahead and gave me that information.

859
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,240
Well cool, I guess it's good to know.

860
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,560
So hey, it'll be out just in time for my birthday.

861
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,560
Oh yeah, definitely.

862
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:42,560
Alright. Speaking of which chat room, what are you getting me for my birthday? It's June 26th, and I do accept cash. I'll take chocolate too. Jamie's shaking my hand.

863
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,560
Give me your present now.

864
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,560
Oh, there you go. Thanks. I appreciate that. Alright. Anything else on your mind, Bandit?

865
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,560
Uh, no. That's all for now, man.

866
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,560
Alright. I appreciate the small correction there. I like that you went to the horse's mouth.

867
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,560
Oh, yeah. Of course.

868
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,560
Alright. Have a good one, buddy.

869
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,560
Alright. You too.

870
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,560
Bye.

871
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:02,560
One more call, and then we'll do the voicemail, and then we'll wrap up the Skype line. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

872
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,720
Who's this ice guy? It's me Ravens dolphin. Hello. Hello Ravens dolphin. What's on your mind?

873
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,460
Well, the DS light breaking street date. Would you get one?

874
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:18,880
No, what do you think about it? Um, I think it's hot but I'm I don't like iPod white. Oh

875
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,040
You don't like the color. Yeah, I hate it

876
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,340
You know somebody was telling me today about a little trick or something and you know, this is a questionable

877
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:33,380
ethics, so do what you want with this advice, but as I understand, what you could do is

878
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:38,400
you go to a store, I think it was EB Games, and you buy your DS Lite and buy the replacement

879
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:45,180
plan with it, so it's only like 15 bucks or whatever, and then when a new color comes

880
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:50,460
out that you want, run over your DS Lite with your car and then take it into EB Games and

881
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,420
say it broke, I want a new one, and voila, you get your new one a new color.

882
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,340
Hey, that's what I did with my PSP and that's what I'm probably going to do with this.

883
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:07,940
You guys, I shouldn't be endorsing such scamming, but I don't know, I kind of get irritated

884
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,580
that I always get asked no matter what store I go into about those damn replacement plans,

885
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,580
so maybe they'll get rid of them.

886
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,580
One more thing.

887
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,580
What?

888
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,860
All right, you remember you were talking about the Minnesota thing?

889
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,860
Uh-huh.

890
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,500
All right, if you're 18, it's 50 bucks.

891
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,340
If you're 16, it's 75.

892
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,340
Wow. That's a really big slap on the wrist.

893
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,340
But then again, what 16-year-old has $75 that they didn't get from Mom or Dad?

894
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,340
And also, if you're 18 years old, there's no games you can't play.

895
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,340
That's true. But you could be buying the games for somebody else.

896
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,340
I guess.

897
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,340
That's weird.

898
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:48,340
As far as the 16-year-old goes, if it was my 16-year-old that did that and got the $75 fine,

899
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,860
expecting me to pay it as the parent I'd be all you better start learning how to

900
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:56,580
say you like fries with that that's how you're gonna pay it off all right

901
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:01,740
anything else ravens dolphin yeah have you ever landed that that plane and top

902
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:07,540
gun uh-oh God back on the NES a refueling it was a pain in the ass

903
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:13,260
enough I don't even remember trying to land it this is one random question of

904
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:17,380
the night all right well thanks for derailing our show we appreciate it all

905
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,740
All right, have a good one, buddy.

906
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,700
Bye-bye.

907
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,100
Ah, we've got crazy listeners.

908
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,380
Not as crazy as this, though.

909
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,740
This is another one from a Nintendo Maniac 64,

910
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,560
left us a voicemail.

911
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,440
It's kind of a plug for another website,

912
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,020
but I thought this was just too funny.

913
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:33,700
I had to play this.

914
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,380
So this is something that was left on our voicemail

915
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:35,880
this week.

916
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,860
Check this out.

917
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:44,020
This is the internet relay service, CA 8617,

918
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:49,820
with a message from Connie Echla, Orange Lounge Radio.

919
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,580
This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

920
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,820
I'm using an online program that allows

921
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,340
you to call people using the internet.

922
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,540
No long distance charge.

923
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,180
You type a message in and hit the GA button,

924
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,180
and your message will be read by a randomly selected talker.

925
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,140
You can first test it out by calling yourself.

926
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,100
you can check this out at sprintip.com.

927
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,440
Have fun and avoid any giant enemy crabs.

928
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,880
GA that's like for a teletypewriter

929
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,800
yeah basically I thought it was cool that he just got some random

930
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,900
you know poor older lady there to have to tell us to avoid giant enemy crabs

931
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,080
that was all kinds of cool

932
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:37,640
now guys don't start sending us a barrage of messages doing this okay the

933
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,960
first time is cool

934
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,920
the second and third and fourth and fifth times will be annoying so don't get

935
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,960
these poor people

936
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,660
to say all these random things I do not want any voicemails left on the line

937
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,120
with you

938
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,120
Hi, we're calling from the teletype service Ridge Racer.

939
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,360
Okay, I will come to your house and beat you up if you do that.

940
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,720
I'll have them call you back and yell obscenities at you.

941
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,320
Wonder Dog Harold in our chat room says the internet relay lady was hot sounding.

942
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:12,480
Dark Sakura just made a face.

943
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,120
That was wrong.

944
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,520
but funny and that's the important part it's funny in a very wrong way

945
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,900
uh... it's only funny until someone gets hurt and it's hilarious

946
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,280
speaking of hilarious

947
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,400
when you get it on tape it's ludicrous I have one more story for you guys

948
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,240
do you remember back in the day this actually has nothing to do with video

949
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,520
games but it does have to do with games

950
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,400
and uh... that does make it a very important story

951
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,800
do you guys remember those books when we were kids the choose your own adventure

952
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,300
books oh yeah

953
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,900
You know those were first published in 1979?

954
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,420
You want to know what? I actually have one from 1980.

955
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,020
It's actually one of my books that got damaged I think in the hurricane.

956
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,260
I remember going to the library and using to check out these books.

957
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,980
Because you know they would do the

958
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,940
book club over the summer where you have to read 50 books.

959
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,820
So you just read a bunch of Choose Your Own Adventure books.

960
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,580
That's how you do the 50 books.

961
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,180
But anyway, get this.

962
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:13,420
Choose Your Own Adventure, they're coming back. This summer

963
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:16,920
eight of the original titles will return to bookstores and they're going to be

964
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,780
revamped with 21st century references like cell phones

965
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:25,300
that's that's the news that's all there is to say. You do this you're dead

966
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,700
you do this you're dead it's a whole new generation to enjoy

967
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,940
after reading the book 50 million times you actually find the one that you live through

968
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,460
you're driving down a street

969
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:37,180
and your cell phone rings answer it or not

970
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,340

971
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,900

972
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:49,940
