9
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,220
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:11,913
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

11
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:30,657
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at my ugly face while I play Uno.

13
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what?

14
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:56,951
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing to it.

15
00:01:56,971 --> 00:02:01,373
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about one of the people testing the camera right now, and what they did is they put it on their dog.

16
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:09,317
[SPEAKER_07]: See their dog panting, just going, I think that's great, because, I mean, I don't know.

17
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,458
[SPEAKER_07]: They had something like this.

18
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:13,979
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the iToy chat, but it's a game.

19
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,000
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to buy it, and that was lame.

20
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they should have totally done this before a lot of stuff just...

21
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,971
[SPEAKER_08]: What I want to know, how many games of Strip Uno are we going to see?

22
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:31,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's really the only practical use of this peripheral that I can think of is Strip Uno.

23
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:32,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Voice chatting.

24
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:35,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it do voice chatting?

25
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:39,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you can use voice chat and you can do video chat and stuff.

26
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:45,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that might be kind of cool because you might hear when a draw for a wild gets played on something, you'll hear, fuck you!

27
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:49,700
[SPEAKER_07]: People can actually do, imagine if you will, over live.

28
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:53,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have video phone sex.

29
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:58,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you ever wanted to show your naughty bits to strangers, here you go.

30
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,191
[SPEAKER_08]: But please, 18 and over only.

31
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:05,857
[SPEAKER_08]: How are they going to stop slutty 17-year-olds from doing this?

32
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:07,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to see that.

33
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:08,139
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, you know...

34
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:13,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how they're going to try to stop them, but that's still going to make for more interesting games.

35
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:14,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I know!

36
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,156
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ah, I'm quitting.

37
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:16,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they'll get warned.

38
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:19,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they figure the community will police itself.

39
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:24,282
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, they're going to use the peripheral to be able to map your face on characters.

40
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:28,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, say, for example, playing multiplayer Rainbow Six Vegas or whatever.

41
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look, he has a penis for a head.

42
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,206
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.

43
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:31,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

44
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:35,569
[SPEAKER_08]: How many boobs are you going to be playing against, literally?

45
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Go into the chat room over at OrangeLinesRadio.com and click on chat.

46
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:43,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Guinness Goblin says, we strip Uno, fat naked gamers.

47
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:52,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Amplitude1 says, strip Monopoly, I think, over in the chat room there.

48
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they are coming out with poker later, so we'll see.

49
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:57,136
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

50
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:03,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, that's not the only peripheral that's coming out for the Xbox 360.

51
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:11,180
[SPEAKER_08]: There's apparently a mole within the Microsoft organization that has some news on other things that are coming out, and this all makes sense.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,142
[SPEAKER_08]: New faceplates with Halo, Forza 2, and Viva Pinata are going to be on their way out.

53
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:19,604
[SPEAKER_08]: A wireless headset is coming out, but as far as I know...

54
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:28,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I was listening to another podcast, I want to say it was All Games Interactive, where they bought Scott for his birthday a headset that was wireless.

55
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:33,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So this must be the official Microsoft headset that's coming out, but you can already get a non-official one.

56
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:38,740
[SPEAKER_07]: They have some pretty cool looking ones that are out right now, but the new wireless one is kind of nifty looking.

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,100
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like...

58
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know how to describe it.

59
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,964
[SPEAKER_08]: A wireless gaming receiver is coming out too for $20.

60
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that mean like a router?

61
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:08,325
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that receiver is actually for your PC.

62
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:09,606
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to plug into the USB.

63
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so you can use your wireless controllers and peripherals with your PC.

64
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:14,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's kind of neat.

65
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:15,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

66
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:19,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And a 256MB memory unit for those of you that are actually using memory units.

67
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:20,629
[SPEAKER_08]: All three of you.

68
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Just spend the extra money and buy a hard drive.

69
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:22,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

70
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:22,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

71
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Some controversy in the Xbox 360 community, yes?

72
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:34,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Peter Moore said something retarded Basically, gamers don't care about backwards compatibility

73
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:42,266
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, he says, nobody is concerned about backwards compatibility.

74
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:47,109
[SPEAKER_07]: We under-promised and over-delivered on that, which, if I remember correctly, no they didn't.

75
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,311
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a very complicated thing, very complex work.

76
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:54,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just stunned that we have hundreds of games that are backwards compatible.

77
00:05:55,293 --> 00:06:00,696
[SPEAKER_07]: He also added, more are coming, but at some point you just go, there's enough, let's move on.

78
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:05,666
[SPEAKER_07]: or people aren't as worried about game being backwards compatible.

79
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:14,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like to think that we've upheld our end of the bargain in making at least two or maybe three hundred games backwards compatible.

80
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:24,321
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, I believe you said you were going to make them all backwards compatible, so that would not be upholding your end of the bargain there at all.

81
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

82
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,951
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your problem for doing that.

83
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:54,233
[SPEAKER_08]: and I, you know what, PlayStation 3, here's one good thing at least I can say about PlayStation 3, if it truly is backwards compatible with all PlayStation 2 and 1 games, that's a huge bonus.

84
00:06:54,634 --> 00:07:00,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, what about the people now that say, why do you buy a new console to play all your old games on?

85
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,462
[SPEAKER_08]: What would be a response to people that are saying that?

86
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:29,038
[SPEAKER_07]: um well for example when you have one game coming out in the month and you may not want that game you know what it's nice to be able to buy some older games also drives more game sales because now there's more games you can play instead of you know maybe the 30 or 40 that are out right now you can go and play 300 and for those that may have limited shelf space too exactly and also you bought a new system you know maybe you sold your xbox maybe it took you know a

87
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:40,792
[SPEAKER_07]: and just, like, basically, you know, failed on you and now you have a new system and you want to be able... Or, for example, you know, what they should have done since, you know, the PlayStation 2 is backwards compatible with all the PlayStation 1 titles.

88
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:53,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Say, for example, you have an Xbox game that comes out and you want to play it, you know, and that might not be on the 360, like, say, for example, The Godfather because the 360 version hasn't come out yet and maybe you want to play that game.

89
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:56,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, you can't because it's not backwards compatible.

90
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:58,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

91
00:07:58,716 --> 00:07:58,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

92
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, there is a point where you just have to say forget it, but I don't know.

93
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:12,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they make a portable system that plays the old Xbox games or something like that, you never know.

94
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:20,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, on a related note, there is a backwards compatibility update coming in the next couple weeks to Xbox Live.

95
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:24,686
[SPEAKER_08]: This was announced on the Gamerscore blog.

96
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:28,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody from the Microsoft team said that there is a backwards compatibility update coming out

97
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,872
[SPEAKER_08]: within the next few weeks, quote unquote.

98
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:31,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time,

99
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:38,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to recall hearing that that download things in the background patch was coming out last week and that didn't happen.

100
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,901
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would imagine it's possible that the backwards compatibility thing will be pushed back.

101
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:45,682
[SPEAKER_08]: No word on what games are going to be backwards compatible.

102
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:46,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't know.

103
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:48,243
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's really sad.

104
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:50,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know if you're going to get your beach volleyball yet.

105
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's the thing that's really sad is all these updates have come out.

106
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,247
[SPEAKER_07]: We had one that added most of the Tom Clancy games.

107
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,268
[SPEAKER_07]: We had another one that added three other games.

108
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:01,992
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened to updates every month?

109
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:03,178
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

110
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:03,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

111
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:05,134
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty sad.

112
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:14,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel sorry for the backwards compatibility team because it feels like we're picking on them a little bit, but probably they're just under, like, they probably got under-budgeted or whatever.

113
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:17,579
[SPEAKER_08]: They're probably working their butts off, but they just don't have the resources to do it.

114
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,439
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not their fault.

115
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:23,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, you know, don't promise that you're going to have updates every month.

116
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:26,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't promise that you're going to have all the games backwards compatible if you're not going to do it.

117
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:30,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Say we're going to support the major titles, you know, and that's it.

118
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:32,365
[SPEAKER_07]: More and more will be coming, you know,

119
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:33,908
[SPEAKER_07]: as the year progresses.

120
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:41,533
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you need to do instead of saying, yeah, all the games are going to be backwards compatible because basically you're lying.

121
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:48,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Say if I went out to buy a car right now and they promised me that that car is going to fly eventually.

122
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's a blatant lie.

123
00:09:51,980 --> 00:10:02,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, technology may come out that may allow my car to fly one of these days, but if that's not something that you're currently working on doing or have no plans on doing, then don't fucking promise it.

124
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:05,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Simple as that.

125
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:05,958
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

126
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, Loki has some further news from Microsoft.

127
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:13,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, kind of.

128
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:15,062
[SPEAKER_08]: This is more a rumor department.

129
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:18,184
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a rumor that keeps coming up in regards to Microsoft, isn't it?

130
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we talked about it a while back.

131
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:23,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what podcast it was on.

132
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:33,392
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, basically there's a group, the Diffusion group, that's saying that Microsoft is planning on launching a portable game system

133
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,269
[SPEAKER_07]: in the market in 2008.

134
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:39,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically they're giving the 360s some time to pick up steam.

135
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly, I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.

136
00:10:43,532 --> 00:10:55,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because that's a market that, you know, granted Nintendo's doing pretty good in, Sony's doing okay in, but they're not really, I mean, it's not anything that's, you know, totally dominating the market.

137
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,999
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have any, you know, must-have games.

138
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,401
[SPEAKER_07]: People aren't going out there and just dying to get a PSP because of X game on their

139
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,337
[SPEAKER_07]: So, sure, why not?

140
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:07,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

141
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:08,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, wait a minute.

142
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:11,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what show it was on that you talked about this before.

143
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,103
[SPEAKER_08]: It was right before E3 because you brought some story in from a business magazine saying X-Player or something.

144
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:17,144
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened with that?

145
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,785
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I think they were talking about.

146
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:19,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing.

147
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:25,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It's some team that they had working on that developed the 360 or something that was working on this.

148
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:32,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wish I had that magazine, but I threw it out a while ago, so we'd have to dig through the podcast to find exactly what I said.

149
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:33,174
[SPEAKER_07]: But

150
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,906
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically it, yeah.

151
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,007
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working on something.

152
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:41,991
[SPEAKER_07]: If anything, you'll probably see it at E3 either next year or the year after that.

153
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:43,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

154
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Be a very interesting move by Microsoft.

155
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,854
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's get away from Microsoft for a little bit.

156
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:50,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, this is a game that you can play on the 360, among other systems.

157
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:54,040
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura has a little bit of news on Final Fantasy XI.

158
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:54,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

159
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

160
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,442
[SPEAKER_04]: We all like our chocobos, right?

161
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:58,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

162
00:11:58,443 --> 00:11:59,103
[SPEAKER_04]: They're tasty.

163
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:00,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it.

164
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:01,545
[SPEAKER_04]: They go good with honey sauce.

165
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, okay, okay, fine.

166
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Squeenix is talking about raising your birds.

167
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

168
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:14,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, on the official site, um, they basically were comparing, uh, Chocobo raising to gardening.

169
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:19,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that would require, uh, a little bit of your time for, uh, one to three months.

170
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,618
[SPEAKER_04]: You begin by finding an egg.

171
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that sort of makes me think of Ragnarok.

172
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you find your egg, and then you have to... But this, in this way, though, you care for your egg by spending, you know...

173
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: By helping it hatch, you use certain items to help it.

174
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:43,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you feed it, and you spend time with it, and you raise your baby chocobo, and you name your chocobo.

175
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:51,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently you'll just be able to do all kinds of stuff with your chocobo that I'm not at liberty to discuss because it sounds kind of strange.

176
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,333
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can apparently breed your chocobos with your friend's chocobos.

177
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,614
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't sleep with it, do you?

178
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's really gross.

179
00:12:57,655 --> 00:12:57,755
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

180
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:02,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine, like, living in your mog house and you're talking about going, Mommy!

181
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:03,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Work, work!

182
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:03,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Work, work!

183
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:04,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

184
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But it should be coming up on the next update.

185
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:08,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

186
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I believe I was reading something about it.

187
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,502
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to check it every day.

188
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:11,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

189
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,122
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this is just a way to suck you into the game.

190
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:15,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

191
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Play me every day.

192
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:18,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict, addict, addict, addict.

193
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Get something cute.

194
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:25,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I did also read something that there will be a way where you can get, like, if you're going on vacation or whatever, somebody can babysit your chugabow.

195
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:26,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Chugabow sitter.

196
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:27,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like a chugabow sitter.

197
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:28,585
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have the chugabow kennel.

198
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:29,646
[SPEAKER_08]: But it costs money.

199
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:31,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Like on, remember on...

200
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:32,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Nintendogs.

201
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:33,304
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

202
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:33,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Neopets.

203
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:34,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

204
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,069
[SPEAKER_04]: How you could, you know, if your animals were all dying, you could just like, you know, put them in the kennel.

205
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all fed.

206
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:42,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to take care of them.

207
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I also think of Nintendogs.

208
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:47,256
[SPEAKER_08]: You could put your dogs that you didn't want anymore, you could take them to the kennel.

209
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:47,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

210
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:49,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Or they could be put down.

211
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:50,759
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the pound.

212
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,761
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll put them down if you leave them there for too long.

213
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:56,144
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a scene in... Mine all ran away.

214
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:58,426
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a scene in Nintendogs that we needed.

215
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:03,035
[SPEAKER_07]: and Ten Dogs where your puppy gets rabies.

216
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta put him down, son.

217
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:09,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Paul, let me do it!

218
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, Loki, you have some news about another very popular RPG.

219
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:19,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Oblivion's getting yet another add-on, which is excellent.

220
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:23,488
[SPEAKER_07]: The new add-on is basically...

221
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:35,406
[SPEAKER_07]: A quest that revolves around finding a powerful mage who has set off in search of the Daedric artifact Mephroon's Razor.

222
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:39,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically the Razor has the ability to instantly kill enemies.

223
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And the mage intends to use it to overthrow the Empire.

224
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:49,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's up to you to make sure that you find it first so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

225
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:53,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically this download is going to be the most expensive download yet.

226
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:57,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming in at $2.99 for the PC users.

227
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:03,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And no price yet on the Xbox Live Marketplace, but it's assumed to be about the same.

228
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:12,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's supposed to give you a massive, massive dungeon to be able to go through.

229
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,302
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as adding 17 new magic items and a ton of new books.

230
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, might add though, if you do happen to find the item, you get to keep it.

231
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:22,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

232
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:24,662
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a death to everybody!

233
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:31,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, going to another very popular, this one an MMO, World of Warcraft.

234
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:37,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't actually have a lot of news about the actual game itself, but there is a trading card game that's coming out.

235
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,418
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to do a card game, it's actually Upper Deck that's doing it.

236
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:42,240
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing a game based on World of Warcraft.

237
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the cool thing about doing the card game is that now, since the video game's been out a little while...

238
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:49,146
[SPEAKER_08]: The Gabe of Penny Arcade did the artwork

239
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:20,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, I know this doesn't make for very good radio, but I can show you guys here in studio, and I'll post this in chat, a picture of what the card looks like.

240
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:29,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you look at the card, you can actually see it looks like the warrior, he's got the big sword, and he's foaming at the mouth, like ready to go into battle.

241
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you know the story of Leroy Jenkins, it kind of fits, so that's pretty funny.

242
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:34,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

243
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,222
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

244
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,929
[SPEAKER_04]: in such an amazingly fantastic way.

245
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we love being interactive, and one of the ways we get you guys to participate in our program is we welcome your emails.

246
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can email us on just about anything.

247
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:05,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

248
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:13,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And once a week, Jamie puts on her hazmat suit and dives in the mailbag and pulls out some of her favorites that hopefully do not have anthrax in them.

249
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope not this time.

250
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need any more disease.

251
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:22,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, who emailed us this week?

252
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:25,836
[SPEAKER_04]: First one is MacMan from DreamStationCC.

253
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:27,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what's coming.

254
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:28,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, Loki!

255
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:31,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple runs Microsoft on their computers.

256
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:34,461
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have Microsoft programs on our Macs, even your goddamn games.

257
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:42,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and for only print media thing, iLife, iMovie, iDVD, iTunes, GarageBand, and iPhoto, where is your god now?

258
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:53,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Designed by Macman, I who have superb taste in computers, unlike Loki Okay, so they have programs to do the same things that PCs do, but they're not better than PCs Can't we all just get along?

259
00:17:53,881 --> 00:18:07,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, this fucking debate's been going on for like six months It's done Hey, it's alright, it's okay, I understand that, okay, maybe Macs don't have as many games It doesn't matter, Mac users don't like games, so that's fine

260
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:09,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a Mac and I like games.

261
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I don't even want it.

262
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,719
[SPEAKER_08]: But the magazine said.

263
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,759
[SPEAKER_04]: The magazine is a lying.

264
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy and use whatever makes you happy.

265
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,040
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

266
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your money.

267
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

268
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Spend it on whatever you want.

269
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Linux on a toaster.

270
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:21,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, that is the point.

271
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:24,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And I bought an iBook and I love it.

272
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:26,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki, you can just, if you don't like that, you can kiss my butt.

273
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:30,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a MacBook with a docking station and a new monitor instead of an iMac.

274
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:31,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have waited.

275
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:32,543
[SPEAKER_08]: There's better ones coming out.

276
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:32,883
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

277
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:33,764
[SPEAKER_08]: MacBook is hot.

278
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:34,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

279
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's keep it moving.

280
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:35,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

281
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Guy message from David.

282
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:41,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I found this thing on Google Video by accident.

283
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:46,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a video of a group of people who put together a play of the first level of the original Mario Brothers.

284
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: The music was a little off-timing at some parts, but I thought it was pretty funny.

285
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:53,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd also be pretty awesome if you guys could do a Flash website for the PSP.

286
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:55,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on it.

287
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:59,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the problem with Flash on the PSP right now is it's slow.

288
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:00,209
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only Flash 2.0.

289
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:03,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's slow, so... Which I don't really know.

290
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I started working with Flash 8, so...

291
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:09,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Urge Sony to get their Flash a little better and then we'll look into it.

292
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:14,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I planned on playing with it, but honestly I don't know too much about the older versions of Flash to make it work right now.

293
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:23,197
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll also do a Wii website when it comes out because they have Opera and it supports Opera 9, which is the newest Opera browser right now.

294
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:26,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you'll get E3 on Wii!

295
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:28,639
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

296
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:32,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, E3 and PSP, I don't know if I'll want to do that next year.

297
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see, we'll see.

298
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,460
[SPEAKER_04]: We also got one from Robway.

299
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,241
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Cue the 8-Bit Sound Effects.

300
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:45,084
[SPEAKER_04]: He linked me a story that's talking about, and this is on Wired News.

301
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:47,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Strap Up and Jump Like Mario.

302
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:57,801
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo Amusement Park is by the same group of New York University students who did the Pac-Manhattan.

303
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:01,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually it was in the same big games class.

304
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:07,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Pac-Manhattan was a recreation of Pac-Man using the streets of New York with Central Park being the ghost area.

305
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:19,992
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they're doing an amusement park where you strap yourselves in and basically you jump through a recreation of the first level of Super Mario Brothers with hooks and everything.

306
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Mario can jump four times the normal...

307
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:23,651
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

308
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:51,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So it actually looks like it's pretty good.

309
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,943
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking about how to basically do video game physics in real life.

310
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought it was a pretty cool application.

311
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little silly, but whatever.

312
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,069
[SPEAKER_08]: We can all get a little silly sometimes.

313
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:10,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a pretty fun idea, unlike the thing that they said was going to be at E3 next year, which wasn't quite as cool.

314
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:18,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So, to the next email, I got one, another one from, actually no, that's the same one.

315
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:21,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Got one from Spoon.

316
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:25,622
[SPEAKER_04]: As opposed to Fork.

317
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:27,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It's three O's.

318
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:28,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Spoon.

319
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:32,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I've been listening to your podcast for about four months and it's good stuff.

320
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:37,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear the different takes and the fact one of you, he shall remain unnamed, hates Max so much.

321
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

322
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,072
[SPEAKER_04]: He's supposed to be unnamed.

323
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:42,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I named him, so ha.

324
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:45,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Max and Nintendo go hand in hand.

325
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:49,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Build a machine that can do what it's set out for correctly.

326
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo equals gameplay.

327
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:51,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Max equals work.

328
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:56,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to share with you another... Loki, just bite your tongue.

329
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:56,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite it.

330
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:59,889
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually linked us to another podcast that talks about DDR.

331
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called AskANinja.com.

332
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:03,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I've heard of Ask a Ninja.

333
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:04,397
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really popular.

334
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're a video cast, actually.

335
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:08,239
[SPEAKER_07]: They are, and it's awesome.

336
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see the DDR episode.

337
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I haven't seen that either, but I don't know.

338
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:21,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I always said that if there was ever a new video game channel, they would have to put them in as a segment.

339
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:24,467
[SPEAKER_08]: How much does it cost to start a TV channel?

340
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:25,127
[SPEAKER_08]: We should start one.

341
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:26,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello there, Orange Launch Radio.

342
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,566
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing on this fine Friday afternoon?

343
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:30,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Hot two days late.

344
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:49,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing just fine, thank you.

345
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:54,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent you this message to ask if you three would honor me on your input on Luminous Mobile.

346
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the game and I absolutely am in love with it.

347
00:22:57,654 --> 00:23:05,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Many fans out there do not even know of this game's existence, which makes me sad.

348
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:10,878
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also a chance for many out there who do not own a PSP to finally experience the genius of this game.

349
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:14,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for taking the time to read this and keep kicking ass.

350
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:18,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Those of you that listen to the show know I am not a big fan of mobile gaming, but I am a huge fan of Luminous.

351
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:19,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check it out.

352
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:21,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if my carrier offers it, though.

353
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:27,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Sprint, who's kind of like the black sheep of the cell phone carrier, so I don't even know if they have Luminous, but I'll check it out if it's out there.

354
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know my game can play games.

355
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a little dyslexia there.

356
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:34,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if my phone can...

357
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine it can, but I haven't tried because God knows how expensive that would be.

358
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check during our next break.

359
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:44,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a review on it, and the guy that reviewed it said he liked it.

360
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it looked very similar.

361
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:50,804
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing they didn't like is that the music's not like MP3.

362
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:54,448
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be, yeah.

363
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It's MIDI, and yeah, it's not very MIDI-tastic.

364
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:00,239
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

365
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one more email.

366
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I got this to my own box, Jamie at OrangeDollsRadio.com.

367
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:05,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

368
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:16,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just going to paraphrase this a little bit, but it's from a guy named Chris, who is a contributor to WeebleStuff.com, who was our website of the week last week.

369
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, that was two weeks ago, right?

370
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks ago, yeah.

371
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:20,090
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your website of the week, yeah.

372
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:20,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

373
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, so somebody heard it.

374
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:25,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, he listens to our podcast, is a big fan.

375
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:26,754
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, he says on here...

376
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:35,048
[SPEAKER_04]: that since it seems none of the other guys on the staff listens to OLR to their great detriment, of course, I felt I should say a big thanks for giving us a plug.

377
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:40,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a fan of OLR for a long time now, and I've got to say you guys are consistently among the best independent gaming podcasts.

378
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that you bothered to mention UK, European games news and release dates.

379
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:50,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I sometimes suspect you guys are the only American games media outlet who are even aware of this little continent's existence.

380
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:53,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we tried.

381
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:54,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I had replied back, though.

382
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:56,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually not reading my own email.

383
00:24:56,894 --> 00:25:11,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, basically, I don't think that it's... With a lot of the content now coming out of, you know, US and, you know, a bit out of Japan, you know, at least for the more niche market, you know, I really think that the rest of the world sort of gets overlooked.

384
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:12,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, gamers are everywhere.

385
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:18,744
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our person from Serbia who emailed us.

386
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:19,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was great.

387
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:28,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that because we have listeners everywhere that it's not just United States.

388
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:29,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everywhere.

389
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:30,446
[SPEAKER_04]: We have listeners in Canada.

390
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:31,286
[SPEAKER_04]: We have listeners in Japan.

391
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:32,426
[SPEAKER_04]: We have listeners in China.

392
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:33,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that out.

393
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:37,748
[SPEAKER_04]: We have listeners all over Europe, UK.

394
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:43,069
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that you're a gamer too.

395
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:45,650
[SPEAKER_04]: We want your voice heard just as well.

396
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,050
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get you the news.

397
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:49,291
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's happening in your area of the world,

398
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,381
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't know about it, let us know.

399
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:52,201
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll mention it.

400
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:57,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I know one of our listeners started a Frapper map a while back.

401
00:25:57,562 --> 00:26:00,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to see where you guys are, so please take a minute to stop by.

402
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:08,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It's frappr.com and then just search for Orange Lounge and put a pin on the map so we can see where our listeners are because that's kind of cool.

403
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:10,885
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just kind of neat knowing where all you guys are.

404
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you're in the U.S.

405
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:13,185
[SPEAKER_08]: because it maps that too.

406
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:16,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I would really like for our listeners...

407
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to have a thread on our forums at orangeoddsradio.com Go to the forums link on the left side of the page.

408
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:24,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know where you're from.

409
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:25,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know where you're listening from.

410
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:30,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be really cool just to put names.

411
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:33,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to think of just statistics.

412
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:37,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all we see are numbers when we look at our stat pages.

413
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:41,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to know who you are, why you listen to us.

414
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I love hearing from our listeners everywhere.

415
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:45,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fantastic.

416
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:47,123
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

417
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:48,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you say that was the last one?

418
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the last one.

419
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:52,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I saved the last one for last.

420
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:52,827
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

421
00:26:53,608 --> 00:26:54,368
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the way to do it.

422
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,028
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

423
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Send us emails.

424
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:57,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLondrina.com.

425
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,473
[SPEAKER_08]: You can ask us whatever, and as long as it's clean, we'll answer it during the show.

426
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:02,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks a lot, those of you guys that email us.

427
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's dirty, I'll save it.

428
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:04,795
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

429
00:27:05,295 --> 00:27:05,916
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll bookmark it.

430
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:10,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, back into some news, some more Sony antics.

431
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God, in the last few days, if this guy David Reeves, you know,

432
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:26,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not hating on Sony, but he's the one that's saying it.

433
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, his quote is this.

434
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:31,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Market share?

435
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:32,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that important.

436
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:33,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Who needs market share?

437
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:34,655
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

438
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:39,225
[SPEAKER_07]: The name of the game is not market share.

439
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It's how fast we can grow the industry.

440
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:46,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Our ambition is to grow 15% a year on hardware and software.

441
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:51,355
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can, we want to try and double digital entertainment in the next 5 to 6 years.

442
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:56,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether we have 40, 50, or 60% of the market share, it's not that important.

443
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's a little thing to kind of be scared about what he said here.

444
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:04,226
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to

445
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Double the digital entertainment world.

446
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:32,889
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX or NINTENDO

447
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:04,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I find the whole story just a little odd.

448
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:06,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an odd thing to say.

449
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:18,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is the same guy, he was saying that, you know, who cares, gamers will just have to pay more for their system because you'll buy whatever it is, even if the system didn't come out with games, you'll buy it because it's Sony.

450
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:21,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is the same jackass that said that.

451
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:25,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what they need to do is shut him up because he's saying really stupid stuff.

452
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:26,808
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

453
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:30,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to more Sony-related news.

454
00:29:30,064 --> 00:29:32,845
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new controller coming out for the PlayStation 2 and PC.

455
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,406
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a tilt controller.

456
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:38,429
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the E-Dimensional G-Pad Pro Gyroscopic Game Pad.

457
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:42,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has tilt-sensing technology, and it's the same thing that the PlayStation 3 has.

458
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:44,333
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out for the PC and the PlayStation 2.

459
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:49,436
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, though, it also has rumble.

460
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:56,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Sony's not putting this out, but didn't Sony say that they can't do rumble in the tilt thing because it'll mess it up?

461
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:57,753
[SPEAKER_08]: PC, PlayStation 2

462
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:17,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know so much about PS2.

463
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:19,106
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of weird.

464
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, we had a letter in the mailbag about a mobile game.

465
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:44,213
[SPEAKER_08]: You have some news that kind of affects another one?

466
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:45,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I sure do.

467
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:59,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirge of Cerberus for mobile is actually called Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode, which is one of the Final Fantasy VII titles coming out, and it's going to be on Amped Mobile for three months starting in the summer.

468
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:04,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, there's no word on if it's going to be out for the UK,

469
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,571
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I played through Final Fantasy 7 and I never even got Vincent?

470
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:30,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What a loss.

471
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:33,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got him without using an FAQ or anything.

472
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:44,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, on Final Fantasy, because I played Final Fantasy VII when it first came out, you know, as you guys, I'm an older gamer, so there wasn't really the whole GameFAQs.com didn't really exist then.

473
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I found him by accident and just randomly asked the right questions.

474
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:50,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I also got Yuffie right the first time.

475
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:50,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, no, no, no.

476
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:53,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Yuffie's the one he asked the questions to.

477
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:54,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Vincent was the safe.

478
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Vincent, you still had to do... Oh.

479
00:31:57,702 --> 00:31:58,482
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I never did the save.

480
00:31:58,703 --> 00:31:59,944
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to answer the right thing.

481
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:01,465
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I never figured out the save.

482
00:32:01,945 --> 00:32:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got both Yuffie and Vincent.

483
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:04,968
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

484
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:06,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Yuffie I figured out just through trial and error.

485
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,811
[SPEAKER_08]: She showed up once in the forest.

486
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:08,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And she keeps stealing your crap.

487
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:13,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I kept running around that same forest until she finally joined my damn party.

488
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:16,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But I somehow or the other managed to ask the right questions the first time.

489
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,441
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

490
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Have some news about the way items are packaged.

491
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate this.

492
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:27,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Just read it.

493
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:28,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Blister packaging.

494
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:29,844
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta love it.

495
00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:44,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, if you don't know what that is, if you've ever seen anything, especially nowadays, any game peripheral or anything out there, it's that hard packaging that is goddamn impossible to open without killing yourself.

496
00:32:44,534 --> 00:32:49,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know for a fact trying to open the Xbox 360 accessories and stuff, I...

497
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff's like glass.

498
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,981
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really scary.

499
00:32:53,401 --> 00:33:00,107
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually, it's funny because Wired News did a little article here called Tales from Packaging Hell.

500
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:09,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, the whole thing behind the packaging is that it's meant to avoid, obviously, theft.

501
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:13,699
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of people have really gotten hurt by this.

502
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:16,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have some pictures, actually, of people with...

503
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:21,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Major gashes on their hands and people being sent to the hospital.

504
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:28,423
[SPEAKER_07]: This one guy, George from Atlanta, sliced his hand open and there was a

505
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:34,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

506
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:58,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it takes me like 10 minutes, just the... I nearly... I really... You can't use scissors, because scissors aren't sharp enough to get through this.

507
00:33:58,395 --> 00:33:59,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to use a knife.

508
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:00,796
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to stab it in there.

509
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:10,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And the knife... The knife, most of the time, unless it's relatively dull, or if it's not as sharp as it can be, it'll slip, and it'll cut yourself the knife.

510
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:17,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Then if you manage to do get it open, the edges are really sharp and jaggedy, and it's just... It's like cutting open glass.

511
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:18,604
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically...

512
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:20,916
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

513
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:53,006
[SPEAKER_09]: The FUs of the Week time.

514
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:54,507
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, start us off.

515
00:34:55,487 --> 00:35:07,670
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the Week goes toward... It's a number of people who have... It's actually a misconception I'm going to put my FU of the Week toward.

516
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:21,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've said at the beginning of the last segment, I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, which is why I was really sick with what I call the plague in November and December, and have been consistently not feeling well.

517
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:27,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's people who say, oh, well, you'll be just fine when you get back from your medical leave.

518
00:35:28,236 --> 00:35:29,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

519
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,098
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not how it works.

520
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:45,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's just, it's something that a lot of people think is either an all-in-your-head sort of thing, you know, or something that you can just fix with a drug, or something that if you just sleep a lot, you'll get over it.

521
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But the whole thing about it is that no matter how much sleep you get, you still feel tired.

522
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:51,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel like you haven't slept.

523
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:59,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You go through phases of being really hungry and then not being hungry at all and nothing will ever make you feel satisfied if you're in one of those phases.

524
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:03,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel like your muscles hurt all the time.

525
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:08,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And for anyone who thinks that it's just an all-in-your-head type of thing, fuck you, okay?

526
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,854
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a fully diagnosed thing.

527
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:15,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that they have to rule out physical practice before they diagnose you with it.

528
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,298
[SPEAKER_04]: But taking a nap doesn't help.

529
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:27,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sleeping for upwards of 10 hours a day while I've been on my medical leave, and it still hasn't helped hardly any.

530
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to learn how to give myself shots on Wednesday, though, which is not fun.

531
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:42,588
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so for anyone who thinks that it's an all-in-your-head sort of thing and that a little rest or some vitamins will help you get over it, it may help, but it's not the cure.

532
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:47,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So stop telling me that I'll feel better when my leave is up, because I don't think I will.

533
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:49,326
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki.

534
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:50,427
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple things.

535
00:36:51,168 --> 00:37:01,477
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, fuck you to Christopher for the smell that's coming from his desk, and I'm going to guess it's from these three empty McFlurry containers, which are probably rotting right now.

536
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:06,522
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really nasty, like, rotten milk smell that's... Ugh.

537
00:37:06,922 --> 00:37:08,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so fuck you to that.

538
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:12,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to the stupid people that are in my apartment complex who are parking their car in the middle of...

539
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, um... I don't know, I'm just... Fuck you and me being hungry...

540
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:47,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and, uh, fucking needles, because every time I get poked with a needle by a doctor, I almost pass out.

541
00:37:48,189 --> 00:37:52,750
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's not necessarily medication or something, but my body, like, goes into shock whenever I have a needle.

542
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:55,891
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, yeah, that sucks.

543
00:37:56,892 --> 00:37:57,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

544
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:58,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, my F.U.

545
00:37:58,592 --> 00:38:02,433
[SPEAKER_08]: goes to this humongous zit that's on my face right now that won't go away, no matter what I put on it.

546
00:38:03,254 --> 00:38:05,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it makes me feel really ugly and sad.

547
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:06,154
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what I put on it part.

548
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:06,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh...

549
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:16,481
[SPEAKER_08]: because it makes me feel ugly and sad and makes me not want to be social because I feel ugly.

550
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:19,983
[SPEAKER_08]: But it'll go away, and then I'll be pretty again.

551
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:23,764
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyway, let's move on to another story.

552
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:28,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, it's all you.

553
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:35,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm wondering if this shouldn't have been before the FU's, but anyways, higher prices for...

554
00:38:37,485 --> 00:38:40,767
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3 and Wii are confirmed by Atari.

555
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:44,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually Atari is the distributor for Sega in some parts of Europe.

556
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,291
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's basically some of the Sega games.

557
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:54,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3 for example is going to cost 67.99 euros.

558
00:38:55,297 --> 00:39:00,500
[SPEAKER_07]: While some other games like World Snooker Championship 2007 will be 73.99 euros.

559
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:15,621
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically on the Wii, Sonic, Wildfire and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz will both be available for 59.99 euros.

560
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:19,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a lot more than what we got to pay for them.

561
00:39:19,963 --> 00:39:20,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

562
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:22,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, Texas.

563
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:25,206
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

564
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:28,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft made a pretty interesting statement this week.

565
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:29,729
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Chris Lewis.

566
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:36,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Works for Microsoft was speaking about Sony's online service saying, I'm flattered that they followed our clear direction.

567
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Plagiarism is a good thing.

568
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,495
[SPEAKER_08]: That in itself isn't such a problem.

569
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:41,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what the market wants.

570
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:44,356
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've known that's what the market wanted all along.

571
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:48,337
[SPEAKER_08]: So that, by the way, was in an interview with Eurogamer.

572
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:53,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So Microsoft kind of taking a swing there that PlayStation 3 is just downright copying them.

573
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:54,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

574
00:39:56,218 --> 00:40:00,059
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, you kind of expect that you're going to get copied in some elements, but whatever.

575
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you have some news about Wii web browsing.

576
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:08,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Opera, of course, as everybody knows, is going to be the web browser on the Wii.

577
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:10,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've actually...

578
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:16,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Release some information of what this is going to support and some of the details on it.

579
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:27,419
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, Opera will be embedded on the Wii's Flash ROM, unlike the DS version, which is actually a cart-based operating system.

580
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:35,403
[SPEAKER_07]: The browser may take advantage of some of the gesture-based navigation and interaction that's available with the Wii controller.

581
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:37,743
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be kind of interesting.

582
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,945
[SPEAKER_07]: No advertisements will be included within the browser.

583
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:46,828
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you shouldn't rule out that there won't be in-game advertising delivered via Opera.

584
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:49,229
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's pretty interesting.

585
00:40:49,249 --> 00:41:01,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing that someone was bringing up about the Dreamcast browser is that they had special features for when you're programming webpages, you can actually make the Dreamcast VMU rumble or display things.

586
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:04,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be really cool if they added that kind of

587
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:12,728
[SPEAKER_07]: to the Wii browser where you can make the controller rumble or special tags or something to use the Wii controller.

588
00:41:12,748 --> 00:41:14,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, something to think about.

589
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,191
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little weird.

590
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:24,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also basically going to be compatible with Opera 9, which is the one that's out currently right now.

591
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:29,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is supposed to support most everything, including Java, so...

592
00:41:30,728 --> 00:41:32,890
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura

593
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:58,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yeah, there's going to be game rentals in Japan.

594
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually started on the 3rd.

595
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:11,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, Koei will put out its first rent-a-net video store at the Taito Game Center in Kanagawa.

596
00:42:12,915 --> 00:42:14,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's not

597
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:20,824
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not any real rental franchises like we have here, not like Blockbuster or anything.

598
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:22,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a very, very new thing there.

599
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:29,006
[SPEAKER_04]: New games will basically rent for 2,800 yen, which is 2,450 over here for five days.

600
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:33,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you bring them back.

601
00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:35,567
[SPEAKER_07]: $24, that's expensive.

602
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:37,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is more expensive in Japan.

603
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:39,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

604
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to say real quick, I had to correct something I said earlier.

605
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:48,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Funnydale actually in the chat room corrected me on something I said about GameFAQs wasn't around when Final Fantasy VII.

606
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:50,036
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually started in 1995.

607
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,719
[SPEAKER_08]: So they actually were around, it's just not a lot of people knew about them, including me.

608
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,981
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly they weren't the site they are now then.

609
00:42:57,181 --> 00:42:57,922
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a long time.

610
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually used them for Super Nintendo stuff back in the day.

611
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,186
[SPEAKER_08]: That's crazy.

612
00:43:02,306 --> 00:43:09,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I used eBay when they first came out, but back when they were... Well, not back when they were Pez dispensers, but just after that, before they got all commercialized.

613
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought Super Metroid on eBay, like, in 97.

614
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:13,993
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyway.

615
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:17,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Websites were different back then, because browsers weren't the same.

616
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:22,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, one more story here, guys, and we're going to go to our Skype line over at orangelaunchradio.com.

617
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:23,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Click on Interact With Us.

618
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:24,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's up?

619
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, a British... What was it?

620
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:27,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

621
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:40,976
[SPEAKER_07]: The SCI, some British publication, was saying that they're going to be extending Eidos' licenses for Hitman and Tomb Raider to the gambling franchises, including online.

622
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,604
[SPEAKER_07]: You're basically going to see some video slot machines based on both Lara Croft and Agent 47.

623
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's interesting.

624
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:59,627
[SPEAKER_07]: You should know, though, that they're still going to steal your money just as well as all the other video slot machines out there.

625
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:06,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, no boobies in the slot machines either.

626
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:07,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

627
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:09,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

628
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:10,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

629
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:15,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't get too excited about slot machines because I personally hate those video slot machines.

630
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're a big waste of money, especially the nickel ones.

631
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:21,791
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to put more nickels in.

632
00:44:22,432 --> 00:44:23,332
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

633
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:24,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of quarters.

634
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:26,655
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, more of the same, whatever.

635
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:55,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, who's this?

636
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:56,764
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

637
00:44:57,584 --> 00:44:58,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.

638
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:00,687
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a little quiet, but what's on your mind?

639
00:45:01,588 --> 00:45:04,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, it's probably because I'm actually using my regular phone.

640
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:05,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, my mic jack died on my laptop.

641
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:06,912
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.

642
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:08,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, get out your thoughts anyway.

643
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:11,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, anyway, I have an announcement to make.

644
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:14,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see if I can load up my test.

645
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:14,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

646
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:18,501
[SPEAKER_11]: From June 7th to 10th, I'm going to be in New York City.

647
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:23,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we're getting an art award for this art show season, um,

648
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:30,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be at the Nintendo World Store on Friday at 11 a.m.

649
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,741
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're not there, come visit me if you want.

650
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:38,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be wearing that pancake button.

651
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:40,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be wearing a shirt with that.

652
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:42,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a topic here on the forum.

653
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:48,086
[SPEAKER_11]: More details, I'll get you a small link for it.

654
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:48,766
[SPEAKER_11]: xrl.us

655
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I heard about half of that because of the connection we have here.

656
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:05,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get this right.

657
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:09,904
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you're going to be at the Nintendo store on Friday and you want to meet other listeners of the show or something?

658
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, at like 11 a.m.

659
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:13,246
[SPEAKER_08]: At 11 a.m.

660
00:46:13,306 --> 00:46:14,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are you going to be wearing?

661
00:46:15,427 --> 00:46:16,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be wearing...

662
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,914
[SPEAKER_11]: a shirt with the pancake bunny on it.

663
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:20,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Oolong.

664
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Oolong, the pancake bunny.

665
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:22,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah.

666
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:23,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor dead bunny.

667
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:24,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that guy rocks.

668
00:46:24,236 --> 00:46:31,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And the URL, just in case if somebody missed it, it's xrl.us slash mz5k.

669
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:32,860
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

670
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:37,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you could use this program to help make yourself more friends in person.

671
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun at the store.

672
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:39,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

673
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:40,084
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

674
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:41,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'll take you at the store.

675
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:43,286
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm letting you go now because your connection sucks.

676
00:46:43,786 --> 00:46:44,086
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

677
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:44,906
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, take care, buddy.

678
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:45,907
[SPEAKER_08]: See ya.

679
00:46:48,024 --> 00:46:49,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so much for that.

680
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go meet listeners.

681
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:53,672
[SPEAKER_08]: We did that last week.

682
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:54,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we did.

683
00:46:54,694 --> 00:46:55,895
[SPEAKER_08]: We did meet a few listeners last week.

684
00:46:55,915 --> 00:46:56,336
[SPEAKER_08]: That was cool.

685
00:46:57,117 --> 00:46:59,400
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to call us, it's OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

686
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Click on Interact With Us over on Skype.

687
00:47:01,463 --> 00:47:04,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It's username OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

688
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:10,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Or again on the telephone, it's 916-226-9067 Let's go to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

689
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, it's DMN, how are you?

690
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:16,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, oh, your connection's much better than the last guy What's on your mind, DMN?

691
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:24,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, as you announced earlier, I had that little contest of exclusive Zelda questions That's right, did you get a winner?

692
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:25,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

693
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:27,082
[SPEAKER_10]: T23M is the winner.

694
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,123
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 23Megas.

695
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:33,123
[SPEAKER_08]: He should be disqualified because he comes on the show once.

696
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:33,843
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

697
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:34,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Let him have it.

698
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:37,784
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a local.

699
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:52,407
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, going back to jumping release dates, I've heard that Nintendo's practices generally they give those offending retailers shipments late or very low shipments later on.

700
00:47:53,387 --> 00:47:53,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't...

701
00:47:55,758 --> 00:47:59,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think Nintendo is going to give a company like Target a big spanking?

702
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:10,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so because I remember Microsoft released Project Gotham 2, I believe it was, a couple of days early and they got beat down for it.

703
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:16,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I recall that they got Halo 2, a very low shipment of Halo 2, I think a half shipment of Halo 2 in each store.

704
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:19,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

705
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:22,028
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think

706
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:26,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Target's going to be in big trouble for releasing the DS Lite early.

707
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:42,314
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the other side, hey, you know, we can get some DS Lites that are already out there, and word of mouth I'm sure travels, and it kind of created a sudden surge of interest a little bit on the blogs while people frantically hunted these down, so I don't think the news is all bad for Nintendo here.

708
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:43,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, not at all.

709
00:48:44,095 --> 00:48:46,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I can actually tell you firsthand, the DS Lite is awesome.

710
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:55,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say the guy that we invited who called in.

711
00:48:55,701 --> 00:48:58,082
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Silent Wind.

712
00:48:58,142 --> 00:48:58,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

713
00:48:58,922 --> 00:48:59,562
[SPEAKER_08]: He had one.

714
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:02,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he brought it to show us.

715
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:04,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at mine right now.

716
00:49:04,743 --> 00:49:05,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks pretty nice.

717
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:06,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Rub it in.

718
00:49:09,352 --> 00:49:10,252
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

719
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:15,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, did you go to a Target to get it, or do you get it from a special, like you work for Nintendo, your special thing?

720
00:49:15,855 --> 00:49:18,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually got mine from an import store.

721
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo just got theirs in.

722
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:21,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

723
00:49:21,477 --> 00:49:21,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

724
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:23,778
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

725
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:25,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

726
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:26,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

727
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:27,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, guys.

728
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, everybody, for participating in the contest.

729
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, there will be more in the future.

730
00:49:30,841 --> 00:49:31,161
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

731
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:31,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

732
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:32,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the fun, DMN.

733
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:33,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

734
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:34,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, guys.

735
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

736
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:35,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

737
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:37,437
[SPEAKER_08]: See, chat's a whole experience.

738
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:44,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if we sometimes, you know, get so caught up in our own conversation we forget to read chat room, there's all types of fun stuff they're doing in chat.

739
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:48,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been, you know, like over 50 people every show in chat room, so it's been very nice.

740
00:49:48,847 --> 00:49:52,210
[SPEAKER_08]: We really appreciate you guys heading on over to chat and checking us out there.

741
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,712
[SPEAKER_08]: We have time to take a couple more calls if anyone else wants to call in.

742
00:49:55,893 --> 00:50:00,857
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeLawnTrader.com, click on Interact With Us, or head on over to your telephone and dial 916-226-

743
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:03,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

744
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:26,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Just waiting to see here if we get any more phone calls.

745
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:28,844
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, we'll just go ahead and wrap things up for tonight.

746
00:50:29,344 --> 00:50:31,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody have any last-minute stories they want to share?

747
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:33,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki or DarkSakura, any last-minute stories for our listeners?

748
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:44,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to talk really quickly about Forza 2 because there are some updates on IGN about it, including that it's going to be built using a completely new 360 engine.

749
00:50:45,191 --> 00:50:46,912
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Forza 1 in HD.

750
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:49,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little slap at Sony there.

751
00:50:49,973 --> 00:50:54,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Forza 2 is going to run at 60 frames per second with reflection mapping on all the cars.

752
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,232
[SPEAKER_07]: running at 60 frames per second as well.

753
00:50:56,672 --> 00:50:59,173
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to support the new wireless racing wheel.

754
00:50:59,813 --> 00:51:17,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll feature 60 tracks, 18 environments, 13 real-world licensed circuits, and will feature over 300 cars from more than 50 of the world's leading manufacturers, including Ferrari, Porsche, Nissan, VW, GM, and Lamborghini, to name a few.

755
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:20,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And Forza will allow people to

756
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:39,847
[SPEAKER_07]: to a new degree of stylization, including alternative engines, suspension kits, bolt-on superchargers, brakes, rims, racing slicks, and work on advanced suspension settings, tire pressure, and gear ratios.

757
00:51:40,127 --> 00:51:42,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like Gran Turismo to the extreme.

758
00:51:43,248 --> 00:51:43,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

759
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:44,208
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

760
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else have any other last-minute stories?

761
00:51:47,129 --> 00:51:47,369
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

762
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:48,427
[SPEAKER_08]: HappyHardcore.com

763
00:52:11,516 --> 00:52:33,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Featuring Lisa Abbott, Desire the Comet Remix And also on Universe, The Acolyte with Treble Basin Attitude Which is going to be a Eurotrans song And Treble Basin Attitude is actually the one that's on the official trailer for Universe So, kind of neat

764
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:39,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell me you flew over there just to play Supernova.

765
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:09,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I'd barely seen Supernova where I was at in Spain, and through parts of Paris and Milan and Rome.

766
00:53:09,973 --> 00:53:12,113
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, wait, you're of Spanish descent, right?

767
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:15,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Peruvian, actually, but we do have family in Spain.

768
00:53:16,114 --> 00:53:16,474
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

769
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:22,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I remember on a previous episode you saying something about that, but whoa-ho, what is wrong with your connection?

770
00:53:22,776 --> 00:53:23,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

771
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,877
[SPEAKER_08]: You got some weird thing going on there with your mic.

772
00:53:27,057 --> 00:53:27,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Fix it.

773
00:53:28,797 --> 00:53:29,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

774
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:29,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

775
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:30,698
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mic?

776
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:40,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for some reason, you said that Supernova was supposed to come out last mid-May, which was a couple of weeks before it actually made the trip out.

777
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:41,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

778
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:46,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Came back, it doesn't seem to me that nothing has appeared.

779
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:51,447
[SPEAKER_03]: By now, if it did come out like Konami said they would...

780
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:59,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I would see... I would see... about, you know, about all the songs from each part of the country.

781
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:01,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here it is, here it is.

782
00:54:01,554 --> 00:54:02,955
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably got pushed back.

783
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:04,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Is anyone really surprised?

784
00:54:05,657 --> 00:54:07,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Games get pushed back all the time.

785
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wouldn't it be prudent to just make that correction?

786
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:16,498
[SPEAKER_03]: To just say that, you know, it might have been released last May or because of what I'm hearing.

787
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:22,845
[SPEAKER_08]: With arcade games, it's usually not the same thing as console because you are not the one that purchases an arcade game.

788
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:23,946
[SPEAKER_08]: The arcade owners do.

789
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,269
[SPEAKER_08]: So to come on the fan side, I don't know.

790
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:31,314
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little different when we're talking about console games, I think, versus arcade games.

791
00:54:32,255 --> 00:54:33,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess, yeah.

792
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:36,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to keep that in mind.

793
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:38,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand where you're coming from.

794
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Sephiroth1215 is yelling out it's mid-June now, so I guess we'll see.

795
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:45,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what it was saying.

796
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.

797
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:51,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, did I miss anything in the past two weeks?

798
00:54:52,131 --> 00:54:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Any gaming news?

799
00:54:54,362 --> 00:55:00,407
[SPEAKER_08]: We took some video of the Ultramix stuff and Universe stuff at E3, and it's on YouTube if you search for OLR.

800
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:04,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And, I don't know, go listen to our old podcast.

801
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:08,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, and you'll get caught up on all your gaming news.

802
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:09,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

803
00:55:09,054 --> 00:55:09,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you like that plug?

804
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:11,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

805
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:20,102
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thing, stuff in Europe is... Even DDR games, you know, here is about above 30...

806
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:23,595
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Zach, I'm hanging up on you.

807
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:24,176
[SPEAKER_08]: You're breaking up.

808
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:25,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to hear it was so expensive.

809
00:55:26,516 --> 00:55:27,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you had fun, though, you lucky bastard.

810
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:28,777
[SPEAKER_08]: At least you get to travel.

811
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:29,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

812
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:30,758
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

813
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:35,519
[SPEAKER_08]: He said everything's more expensive over there is kind of what I picked up from that.

814
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:38,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot we have a voicemail I have to play, too, so we'll play that in a moment.

815
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's do some more calls here real quick.

816
00:55:40,481 --> 00:55:41,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

817
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:42,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

818
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:43,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, man?

819
00:55:43,522 --> 00:55:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Bandit.

820
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:45,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Bandit.

821
00:55:45,182 --> 00:55:45,722
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

822
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:49,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that last guy that was just talking about the supernova?

823
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:50,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

824
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:57,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I called Betson Air Prizes last week, and they actually told me it's shipping the last two weeks of June.

825
00:55:58,085 --> 00:55:59,326
[SPEAKER_06]: You went right to the horse's mouth.

826
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:11,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I actually called the number that was on Konami's website, and they forwarded me to a guy who handles the machines in the Pittsburgh area.

827
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:14,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, do you work for an arcade, or are you just a crazed fan?

828
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:16,856
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not a crazed fan.

829
00:56:17,662 --> 00:56:19,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit, but you know what I used to?

830
00:56:19,663 --> 00:56:20,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, a hardcore fan.

831
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:27,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the owner of the local arcade, and he went ahead and gave me that information.

832
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:29,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, cool.

833
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:31,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's good to know.

834
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hey, it'll be out just in time for my birthday.

835
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

836
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of which, chat room, what are you getting me for my birthday?

837
00:56:37,411 --> 00:56:40,093
[SPEAKER_08]: It's June 26th, and I do accept cash.

838
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:40,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take chocolate, too.

839
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:42,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's shaking my hand.

840
00:56:42,614 --> 00:56:43,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me your present now.

841
00:56:43,414 --> 00:56:43,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you go.

842
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:44,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

843
00:56:44,155 --> 00:56:44,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

844
00:56:45,255 --> 00:56:45,555
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

845
00:56:46,055 --> 00:56:47,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else on your mind, Bandit?

846
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:48,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no, that's all for now, man.

847
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:18,716
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I think it's hot, but I don't like iPod White.

848
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:20,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you don't like the color?

849
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:22,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I hate it

850
00:57:48,374 --> 00:57:51,136
[SPEAKER_08]: and then take it into EB Games and say it broke.

851
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:51,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a new one.

852
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And voila, you get your new one in a new color.

853
00:57:54,978 --> 00:57:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's what I did with my PSP and that's what I'm probably going to do with this.

854
00:57:59,240 --> 00:57:59,880
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys.

855
00:58:01,821 --> 00:58:05,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I shouldn't be endorsing such scamming, but I don't know.

856
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:13,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of get irritated that I always get asked no matter what store I go into about those damn replacement plans, so maybe they'll get rid of them.

857
00:58:14,227 --> 00:58:14,548
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

858
00:58:14,628 --> 00:58:16,549
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember you were talking about the Minnesota thing?

859
00:58:16,769 --> 00:58:16,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

860
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:19,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, if you're 18, it's $50.

861
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're 16, it's $75.

862
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:26,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's a really big slap on the wrist.

863
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:31,637
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, what 16-year-old has $75 that they didn't get from mom or dad?

864
00:58:32,037 --> 00:58:36,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if you're 18 years old, there's no games you can't play.

865
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,601
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

866
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:39,822
[SPEAKER_08]: But you could be buying the games for somebody else.

867
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:41,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

868
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:42,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's weird.

869
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:53,007
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the 16-year-old goes, if it was my 16-year-old that did that and got the $75 fine and expecting me to pay it as the parent, I'd be all, you better start learning how to say you like fries with that.

870
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:57,328
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you're going to pay it off.

871
00:58:57,348 --> 00:58:58,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else, Ravenstolphin?

872
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:02,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, have you ever landed that plane in Top Gun?

873
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, back on the NES?

874
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Refueling it was a pain in the ass enough.

875
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even remember trying to land it.

876
00:59:12,023 --> 00:59:12,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Internet Relay Service

877
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:49,752
[SPEAKER_00]: CA 8617 with a message from Connie E. Chla, Orange Lounge Radio.

878
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:52,573
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

879
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:59,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using an online program that allows you to call people using the Internet, no long-distance charge.

880
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:07,656
[SPEAKER_00]: You type a message in and hit the GA button, and your message will be read by a randomly selected talker.

881
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:10,537
[SPEAKER_00]: You can first test it out by calling yourself.

882
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:14,601
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check this out at SprintIP.com.

883
01:00:15,102 --> 01:00:18,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun and avoid any giant enemy crabs.

884
01:00:21,212 --> 01:00:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: GA, that's like for a teletype writer.

885
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:23,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, basically.

886
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:30,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was cool that he just got some random, you know, poor older lady there to have to tell us to avoid giant enemy crabs.

887
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:31,919
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all kinds of cool.

888
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, guys, don't start sending us a barrage of messages doing this, okay?

889
01:00:37,623 --> 01:00:38,764
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time is cool.

890
01:00:39,104 --> 01:00:41,366
[SPEAKER_08]: The second and third and fourth and fifth times will be annoying.

891
01:00:41,426 --> 01:00:44,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't get these poor people to say all these random things.

892
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:50,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not want any voicemails left on the line with, you know, hi, we're calling from the teletype service, Ridge Racer.

893
01:00:51,572 --> 01:00:55,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I will come to your house and beat you up if you do that.

894
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:59,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have them call you back and yell obscenities at you.

895
01:01:03,981 --> 01:01:07,243
[SPEAKER_08]: WonderDog Harold in our chatroom says the internet relay lady was hot sounding.

896
01:01:10,866 --> 01:01:12,347
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura just made a face.

897
01:01:13,888 --> 01:01:15,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That was wrong.

898
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,951
[SPEAKER_08]: But funny, and that's the important part.

899
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:18,451
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.

900
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:19,752
[SPEAKER_04]: In a very wrong way.

901
01:01:20,763 --> 01:01:22,925
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only funny until someone gets hurt, then it's hilarious.

902
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:28,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of hilarious... When you get it on tape, it's ludicrous.

903
01:01:29,069 --> 01:01:30,230
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one more story for you guys.

904
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:35,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember back in the day... This actually has nothing to do with video games, but it does have to do with games.

905
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:39,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And that does make it a very important story.

906
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:43,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys remember those books when we were kids, the Choose Your Own Adventure books?

907
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:44,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah!

908
01:01:44,379 --> 01:01:45,580
[SPEAKER_08]: You know those were first published in 1979?

909
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:45,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

910
01:01:47,978 --> 01:01:48,539
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

911
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:07,143
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you do the 50 books.

912
01:02:07,843 --> 01:02:08,703
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, get this.

913
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:11,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Choose your own adventure.

914
01:02:11,584 --> 01:02:12,385
[SPEAKER_08]: They're coming back.

915
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:20,548
[SPEAKER_08]: This summer, eight of the original titles will return to bookstores and they're going to be revamped with 21st century references like cell phones.

916
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:22,343
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the news.

917
01:02:22,383 --> 01:02:23,243
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all there is to say.

918
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:25,084
[SPEAKER_04]: You do this, you're dead.

919
01:02:25,424 --> 01:02:26,305
[SPEAKER_04]: You do this, you're dead.

920
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:27,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole new generation to enjoy.

921
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:31,868
[SPEAKER_04]: After reading the book 50 million times, you actually find the one that you live through.

922
01:02:31,908 --> 01:02:34,970
[SPEAKER_07]: You're driving down a street and your cell phone rings.

923
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer it or not.

924
01:02:37,332 --> 01:02:37,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer it, you're dead.

925
01:02:38,032 --> 01:02:40,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer it, you crashed into a car.

926
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:41,074
[SPEAKER_07]: You're dead.

927
01:02:41,977 --> 01:02:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't answer it.

928
01:02:42,577 --> 01:02:45,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone else on their cell phone crashed into you.

929
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:46,478
You're dead.

930
01:02:46,578 --> 01:02:48,499
[SPEAKER_08]: You are standing in front of a white house.

931
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:49,759
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a mailbox here.

932
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:50,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn to page seven.

933
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:52,160
[SPEAKER_08]: You have been eaten by a grue.

934
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,601
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get that reference, I love you.

935
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:58,521
[SPEAKER_08]: We should do Orange Lounge, the Choose Your Own Adventure.

936
01:02:58,601 --> 01:02:58,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

937
01:02:59,282 --> 01:03:02,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we had Illusion wrote a game.

938
01:03:02,382 --> 01:03:04,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the game, but we need our own Choose Your Own Adventure book.

939
01:03:04,043 --> 01:03:05,223
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a Choose Your Own Adventure book.

940
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:06,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do that on a webpage.

941
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:08,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good idea.

942
01:03:08,797 --> 01:03:10,238
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura needs food badly.

943
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:40,146
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll see you guys next week with more Orange Lounge Radio we appreciate you guys tuning in have a great week see you next time
