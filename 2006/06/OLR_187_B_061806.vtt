[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:19.989 --> 00:25.432
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 187 for this June 18th, 2006.

00:27.113 --> 00:28.614
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's get right back into the news.

00:28.634 --> 00:31.756
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start it off with Loki has a story about the PlayStation 3.

00:32.337 --> 00:34.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, don't we always have a story about the PlayStation 3?

00:35.358 --> 00:36.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is newsworthy.

00:36.839 --> 00:37.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

00:38.680 --> 00:45.965
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, now the whole thing coming out with the PlayStation 3 is, what's it going to be like with retailers?

00:46.665 --> 00:47.706
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I going to be able to get one?

00:48.226 --> 00:49.607
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of quantities can we expect?

00:50.319 --> 01:06.971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to Games First, they had an internal GameStop email which expressed concern over how many PS3s their chain, which is the largest chain out there, including eBay games, would have available.

01:07.311 --> 01:16.978
[SPEAKER_02]: And a local store that would be receiving between 50 to 100 Xbox 360s at launch, and that wasn't very many, is expected to get no more than 20 PS3s.

01:16.998 --> 01:17.078
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:19.761 --> 01:22.463
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is true, that's going to suck.

01:23.864 --> 01:28.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, it's not going to matter because people won't be buying them.

01:28.407 --> 01:29.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be a jerk.

01:29.668 --> 01:36.013
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be the anti-Sony guy because I'm really trying to give everybody a fair shot here, even if I'm being constantly disappointed over there.

01:36.393 --> 01:41.257
[SPEAKER_03]: But, is it realistic that there's going to be as many people that want the PlayStation 3 as one at Xbox 360?

01:41.297 --> 01:41.657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:41.797 --> 01:42.298
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.

01:43.098 --> 01:45.320
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there will be a lot of people wanting it, but...

01:46.308 --> 01:46.768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

01:47.269 --> 01:52.633
[SPEAKER_02]: It will still be a clusterfuck like the 360 launch was, I think.

01:54.535 --> 01:59.239
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they're going to be having trouble selling those 20 units.

01:59.259 --> 02:00.860
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I think it's going to be a problem, though.

02:01.441 --> 02:05.184
[SPEAKER_02]: But are those 20 units just going to end up on Craigslist, eBay, etc.?

02:05.224 --> 02:06.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they will.

02:07.546 --> 02:07.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

02:07.986 --> 02:09.707
[SPEAKER_02]: People learned that they can do that.

02:09.767 --> 02:10.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad, sad, sad.

02:10.668 --> 02:10.848
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Any way that we can dodge this?

02:17.142 --> 02:24.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this just brace yourselves, get your pre-orders in ASAP as soon as they'll start taking them or have a game plan if you really want this?

02:24.607 --> 02:25.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much, yeah.

02:25.607 --> 02:26.468
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, heads up.

02:26.928 --> 02:28.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you learned from the Xbox 360 experience.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to a completely different topic.

02:32.372 --> 02:39.637
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it does have to do with the next generation of gaming, but it's an old game, very, very old game, making its way into the next generation of gaming.

02:39.657 --> 02:40.057
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Jamie?

02:40.277 --> 02:41.418
[SPEAKER_09]: This makes my heart happy.

02:42.149 --> 02:44.232
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon's Lair, Sega CD, Arcade Emulator

02:54.264 --> 02:57.005
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it on our two copies on DVD.

02:57.205 --> 02:59.586
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about the game that you love so much?

02:59.667 --> 03:04.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Because honestly, if you just memorize the... That doesn't matter.

03:04.329 --> 03:05.609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Don Bluth animation.

03:05.669 --> 03:06.510
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so cool.

03:06.950 --> 03:09.691
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's neat watching all the different ways he turns into a skeleton and dies.

03:10.371 --> 03:13.093
[SPEAKER_09]: And on top of that, it's just really fun.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.615
[SPEAKER_09]: So Digital Leisure is bringing it out in high definition for the PC.

03:18.750 --> 03:19.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for the PC.

03:20.291 --> 03:26.354
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, which means that I'm basically going to be hooking it up through my laptop to our 50-inch widescreen and playing the hell out of it.

03:26.835 --> 03:27.735
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be kind of cool.

03:28.015 --> 03:30.457
[SPEAKER_09]: So imagine how that's going to look on my TV.

03:30.657 --> 03:31.217
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait a minute.

03:31.237 --> 03:34.179
[SPEAKER_03]: These cartoons were made in 83 or something, right?

03:34.219 --> 03:35.479
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still awesome.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really going to look that much different in HD?

03:38.141 --> 03:38.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what are they going to do?

03:38.801 --> 03:40.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to redo it or anything?

03:40.442 --> 03:45.825
[SPEAKER_09]: They're basically taking the original footage from what I understand and redoing it for high definition.

03:45.845 --> 03:46.866
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be cool.

03:46.886 --> 03:46.926
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

03:47.706 --> 03:52.210
[SPEAKER_09]: But imagine, when it first came out, it was on Laserdisc.

03:52.751 --> 03:57.775
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was the cleanest thing out there in the 80s as far as its resolution.

03:58.035 --> 04:02.839
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cleaner than almost anything that you'd get at your house for any type of animation.

04:02.959 --> 04:07.924
[SPEAKER_09]: So by that respect, I'm actually pretty excited about this.

04:07.984 --> 04:11.887
[SPEAKER_09]: And also they're going to be following up with Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.

04:13.188 --> 04:13.969
[SPEAKER_09]: Time warp!

04:14.970 --> 04:15.310
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting thought there from Xander K in our chatroom.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon's Lair for Xbox Live Arcade, Xander says.

04:21.538 --> 04:21.798
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

04:21.838 --> 04:22.880
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a little big.

04:22.900 --> 04:23.361
[SPEAKER_03]: A little big.

04:24.102 --> 04:24.903
[SPEAKER_09]: XBOX ARCADE GAME

04:53.917 --> 04:55.558
[SPEAKER_02]: probably, what, 40, 50 megs?

04:55.958 --> 05:02.081
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 50 megs because they have to keep it under the size of the memory card.

05:02.941 --> 05:12.826
[SPEAKER_09]: So, a 700 meg game versus, and that's also not counting, we have to include audio with that.

05:13.106 --> 05:18.768
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure compression technology is a lot better now than it was then, but still, keep that in mind.

05:19.049 --> 05:21.009
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about full solid animation.

05:21.049 --> 05:22.070
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt that it's going to

05:22.924 --> 05:28.176
[SPEAKER_09]: really be able to pull out well, at least and maintain proper resolution.

05:28.636 --> 05:38.004
[SPEAKER_03]: GS191 in our chatroom, orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat, says Sky, they're going back to old 30s and 40s movies and remastering them in HD and they look damn good to boot.

05:38.464 --> 05:44.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have seen some of the old movies on the HD channels we have here and they look pretty good.

05:44.188 --> 05:47.411
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they still look dated, but okay, I'm willing to give it a fair shot.

05:47.451 --> 05:49.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Dragon's Lair.

05:49.353 --> 05:54.857
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a neat, I just love the concept and it's a very unique type of game.

05:55.077 --> 06:03.279
[SPEAKER_09]: Also in the next few weeks, keep your eye on our stuff at stuff.orangechallengeradio.com, our blog, for a review.

06:04.439 --> 06:06.040
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, someone's getting the hookup.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.080
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone is.

06:07.160 --> 06:07.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

06:07.900 --> 06:13.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, also our chat room brings up, I want to say it was VX, JasonXV, Dark Knight, somebody over there was talking about Space Ace.

06:13.782 --> 06:15.882
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we get success with Dragon's Lair.

06:15.902 --> 06:16.282
[SPEAKER_09]: They did Space Ace.

06:16.682 --> 06:18.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're going to do Space Ace HD and all that good stuff?

06:18.583 --> 06:19.703
[SPEAKER_09]: They said it.

06:19.743 --> 06:23.924
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the next one out should be Space Ace, and let me double check it once more.

06:25.887 --> 06:28.268
[SPEAKER_09]: Next Out Space, AceHD, and Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp

06:46.665 --> 06:56.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of taking old games and making them new all over again, the Xbox 360 got a backwards compatibility update this week, and 21 new games are playable.

06:58.055 --> 07:02.319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 7 more in Japan, so you get 28 if you're Japan.

07:02.559 --> 07:04.061
[SPEAKER_03]: But 21 new games are now playable.

07:04.521 --> 07:12.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Amp 2, Doom 3, Fatal Frame, Silent Hill 4, LEGO Star Wars, Minority Report...

07:13.269 --> 07:19.914
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider-Man, Spawn Armageddon, Star Wars Battlefront, The Punisher, just to name a few on the list there.

07:19.954 --> 07:22.276
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see the full list, head on over to Xbox.com.

07:22.296 --> 07:24.258
[SPEAKER_03]: They've updated their backwards compatibility list.

07:24.858 --> 07:28.882
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I did pop in my copy of Silent Hill 4 The Room just to kind of check out, see what it looked like.

07:29.242 --> 07:30.483
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked really clean.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it does look better than it does on the Xbox.

07:32.745 --> 07:34.126
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is about it.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.248
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the software is uprising it or something, but...

07:36.568 --> 07:37.509
[SPEAKER_03]: The game looked pretty nice.

07:38.350 --> 07:45.836
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look 360 game quality, but it's definitely a little bitty baby step up from the Xbox, so I was pretty impressed.

07:46.456 --> 07:53.482
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kind of sad, though, that still it's not... Most of my collection I still cannot play on the 360.

07:53.522 --> 07:55.804
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of it I still can't play.

07:56.545 --> 07:57.205
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hmm.

07:57.746 --> 07:58.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

07:59.144 --> 07:59.444
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

07:59.704 --> 08:01.926
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how long it'll take before we can play more of them.

08:01.946 --> 08:02.306
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

08:02.486 --> 08:03.747
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they're going to keep going?

08:03.787 --> 08:06.628
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Peter Moore took back what he had said last week and all that stuff.

08:06.948 --> 08:15.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they're going to go back and really take an effort to make all or at least all of the top 100 best-selling games playable?

08:15.573 --> 08:28.100
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think this is something that slowly is going to phase out and Microsoft's just going to try and give us new stuff to make us forget about this whole mistake of not having these

08:28.479 --> 08:29.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Backwards Compatibility Games Sooner

08:59.571 --> 09:00.591
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not, so I don't care.

09:00.852 --> 09:01.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but, I don't know.

09:02.052 --> 09:02.332
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

09:02.352 --> 09:03.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they have to patch them all at once.

09:03.573 --> 09:03.873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

09:04.833 --> 09:05.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

09:05.213 --> 09:08.875
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Microsoft's making a lot of interesting statements this week.

09:08.915 --> 09:09.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Loki?

09:10.015 --> 09:12.436
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorta, yeah.

09:12.496 --> 09:15.338
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's somebody on their development staff.

09:15.438 --> 09:27.943
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, Microsoft's Matt Lee, a developer in Microsoft's game technology group, said, and I quote, Japan's not necessarily the most important market for gaming these days.

09:29.023 --> 09:33.605
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also not quite as large as the US and European markets.

09:34.566 --> 09:35.586
[SPEAKER_09]: That's hilarious.

09:38.467 --> 09:43.610
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody out there... Well, Nintendo's doing a good job of not saying anything.

09:44.150 --> 09:51.373
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that unless you're the PR guy at Microsoft or you're the PR guy over at Sony...

09:52.332 --> 09:58.357
[SPEAKER_02]: You should probably shut the hell up about everything because you're just digging yourself into a hole.

10:21.690 --> 10:26.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Stock prices, not that important.

10:26.354 --> 10:28.476
[SPEAKER_02]: What's important is what color our consoles come in.

10:29.978 --> 10:30.838
[SPEAKER_02]: That's damn important.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.002
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, DarkSakura, what do you think about that statement?

10:35.222 --> 10:39.266
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole Japan is not that important.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.248
[SPEAKER_09]: That's utter crap.

10:41.548 --> 10:42.349
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, think about it.

10:43.783 --> 10:54.389
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just a big market for the fact that there are people who stand in line for new releases of games who basically are stalkerish over voice actors for games.

10:55.010 --> 10:57.791
[SPEAKER_09]: We're importing games from there because they're better than what we have here.

10:59.152 --> 11:05.696
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just complete and utter crap to say that the market is just not as important as the fact that they are not properly catering to that market.

11:06.383 --> 11:17.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that we might have a biased perspective being that the background on this program, we've always kind of been fans kind of geared towards that Japanese import audience or kind of more of the games we play.

11:18.094 --> 11:22.999
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the bigger picture... I'm referring over just to the social side that games have.

11:23.539 --> 11:30.446
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I look at our, you know, the fan base for a lot of these games is a lot bigger than...

11:31.420 --> 11:40.707
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, of course, it is here, because here, to us, it's niche, but to a lot of the fandom groups there, there's a lot bigger crowd, I think.

11:41.308 --> 11:45.851
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got those people that are going to stand in line for a new RPG.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Where we have the Madden crowds are just a few people at a time, pretty much.

11:51.460 --> 11:56.061
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be a busier sales day, but you don't have people just hanging out in lines outside of stores.

11:56.661 --> 12:00.522
[SPEAKER_09]: Or going to meet so-and-so voice actor who was in this game.

12:00.942 --> 12:01.862
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't happen here.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.482
[SPEAKER_09]: Games are a lot.

12:04.082 --> 12:07.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just the fact that there's a big market for it.

12:08.043 --> 12:09.563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big social thing, too.

12:10.284 --> 12:11.284
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot bigger than it is here.

12:11.304 --> 12:12.084
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just in general.

12:14.741 --> 12:16.927
[SPEAKER_09]: For us it's niche, over there it's a lot bigger.

12:17.563 --> 12:19.364
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP Unit, AC Adapter, Battery Pack, 32MB Card

12:44.120 --> 12:45.080
[SPEAKER_03]: and LocoRoco.

12:45.120 --> 12:51.782
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all packaged together in a special box and it comes out July 13th for 24,800 yen.

12:52.222 --> 12:54.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Also has a special LocoRoco case that goes with it.

12:55.463 --> 12:57.363
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the special Katamari case.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.484
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

12:59.784 --> 13:00.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool?

13:00.264 --> 13:00.964
[SPEAKER_03]: Worth importing?

13:01.164 --> 13:03.044
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess you already have a PSP so maybe not.

13:03.405 --> 13:07.826
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool, I mean, but honestly I've already got a PSP.

13:08.766 --> 13:09.726
[SPEAKER_09]: I just care about the game.

13:11.636 --> 13:12.376
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still kind of neat, though.

13:12.396 --> 13:15.237
[SPEAKER_09]: And I already have a cool case running, because Dan got me the one that came out with me and my Katamari.

13:16.957 --> 13:17.457
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I don't have.

13:18.457 --> 13:21.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for those of you guys that love to import things, maybe there'll be something there.

13:22.098 --> 13:23.398
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, DarkS... Oh, yeah?

13:23.418 --> 13:28.139
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like getting all the stuff that came with Poppin' Music 11, getting teacups and towels.

13:28.259 --> 13:30.180
[SPEAKER_03]: They got some crazy collector editions in Japan.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.220
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what I have.

13:31.240 --> 13:40.622
[SPEAKER_09]: I have, on Dreamcast, I have the Cardcaptor Sakura game that came with a pillowcase, a plate, a spoon, a fork, and a clock.

13:41.246 --> 13:41.806
[SPEAKER_09]: A wall clock.

13:44.729 --> 13:45.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

13:45.469 --> 13:47.071
[SPEAKER_03]: And would you actually use any of that stuff?

13:47.251 --> 13:48.372
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it just collector stuff?

13:48.772 --> 13:49.573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's collector stuff.

13:49.933 --> 13:52.875
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I might put the clock up when we make my art room.

13:53.316 --> 13:53.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

13:54.016 --> 13:55.517
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I love my Cardcaptor Sakura clock.

13:56.578 --> 13:58.080
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, take us to our next story.

13:59.140 --> 14:00.001
[SPEAKER_09]: A bunch of stuff happened.

14:01.002 --> 14:01.762
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, actually, yeah.

14:01.783 --> 14:02.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Very descriptive, thank you.

14:03.444 --> 14:09.369
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an article for the Question of the Week on Gamasutra about...

14:10.583 --> 14:17.928
[SPEAKER_09]: In an interview with Chris Crawford, basically, he was the creator of Balance of Power.

14:18.028 --> 14:22.351
[SPEAKER_09]: He was basically saying new ideas don't go anywhere, so the industry is just rehashing the same stuff over and over again.

14:22.771 --> 14:29.236
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing inherently wrong with recycling the same thing over and over and over, but how do you know what you're missing if you're not trying?

14:29.276 --> 14:31.437
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anyone noticed that we don't appeal to the general public?

14:31.597 --> 14:32.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a quote from him.

14:33.793 --> 14:40.296
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a new question now that's on their question of the week page, and I'll get a link to that momentarily.

14:41.037 --> 14:53.183
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's, what examples of innovation in design business or other areas do you think disprove the notion that the game industry is not evolving as quickly as it should be, or is Chris Crawford right?

14:53.743 --> 15:01.367
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's actually pretty interesting, I think, being that I've always thought that innovation needs to happen in games.

15:02.185 --> 15:04.887
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we need to be seeing more of that.

15:05.427 --> 15:16.013
[SPEAKER_09]: So the actual article, if you go onto Gamasutra's website, it's got a pretty big URL.

15:16.033 --> 15:17.333
[SPEAKER_09]: Just look for the June 14th story.

15:17.754 --> 15:18.554
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be a link to that.

15:18.594 --> 15:25.678
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would actually really like to see some of our people, some of our listeners, I should say, respond to that.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.419
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually curious myself.

15:27.539 --> 15:29.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, send us an email to

15:29.659 --> 15:35.141
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orangejonesradio.com because I'd actually like to air some of the same responses here on the show too.

15:36.362 --> 15:37.062
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.043
[SPEAKER_03]: More to come then on that.

15:38.363 --> 15:38.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

15:38.523 --> 15:39.323
[SPEAKER_03]: All the feedback thing.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.344
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's a pretty good question.

15:41.864 --> 15:44.526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see if there's any response there in our chat room.

15:44.806 --> 15:46.646
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still all over at orangejonesradio.com.

15:46.687 --> 15:47.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

15:47.187 --> 15:51.709
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still all consumed there with the Cardcaptor Sakura pack that you have there.

15:52.389 --> 15:54.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll put pictures of it up on our site.

15:54.590 --> 15:56.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, DarkTetsuya says, here's a comment relating to that.

15:56.911 --> 15:59.072
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, well, what's more innovative than the Wii?

16:02.000 --> 16:02.380
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

16:03.321 --> 16:06.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii is getting a lot of brownie points for being innovative.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.303
[SPEAKER_03]: A very innovative system.

16:09.423 --> 16:10.784
[SPEAKER_03]: I say you write that down.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Send that in, DarkTetsuya.

16:14.245 --> 16:14.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

16:15.005 --> 16:15.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

16:16.606 --> 16:17.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

16:17.346 --> 16:19.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the Wii, what's Nintendo up to?

16:19.787 --> 16:30.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Nintendo has a new Club Nintendo, which is, I guess, a brand new website that they're launching that you can get a ton of really exclusive...

16:31.425 --> 16:33.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo stuff.

16:33.529 --> 16:35.352
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything they've got.

16:35.432 --> 16:39.860
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, some different notebooks.

16:39.921 --> 16:40.642
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get tape

16:41.720 --> 16:43.461
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Animal Crossing characters on it.

16:44.362 --> 16:51.306
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got these folders that have Mario stuff on there.

16:52.026 --> 17:01.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my favorites, they have a DS case that holds nine different styluses, all different colors of the rainbow, and nine games that's available.

17:01.992 --> 17:05.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Also some multicolored DS Lite cases.

17:07.133 --> 17:12.475
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a Mario, kind of like a bookshelf for your Nintendo DS games.

17:13.255 --> 17:25.278
[SPEAKER_02]: And then probably the best thing out of all of them on there, an exclusive Nintendo DS game, the Game & Watch Collection, where you can play Game & Watch games on your DS.

17:25.765 --> 17:26.125
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy!

17:26.645 --> 17:29.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Allow me to be the first to say, Game & Watch games sucked.

17:29.226 --> 17:29.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I want this?

17:30.227 --> 17:31.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Game & Watch!

17:31.647 --> 17:34.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of nostalgia value.

17:34.408 --> 17:35.948
[SPEAKER_03]: They totally kicked the ass of Tiger Toys.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.089
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

17:39.170 --> 17:39.610
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

17:39.730 --> 17:41.150
[SPEAKER_02]: For Japan only, unfortunately.

17:41.630 --> 17:45.992
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're wanting to check it out, it's... Ah, you know that shit will show up on eBay.

17:46.112 --> 17:50.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Club.nintendo.jp slash new underscore present.

17:51.654 --> 17:52.394
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go.

17:55.194 --> 17:58.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on to another story.

17:58.496 --> 18:01.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the Wii as well, DarkSakura has a story relating to the Wii.

18:02.117 --> 18:02.958
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I sure do.

18:03.798 --> 18:05.279
[SPEAKER_09]: So, who's a fan of Call of Duty 3?

18:05.979 --> 18:06.980
[SPEAKER_09]: All five people?

18:07.100 --> 18:07.740
[SPEAKER_09]: No, kidding.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hugely successful game.

18:09.561 --> 18:10.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not in this room.

18:11.042 --> 18:12.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I love Call of Duty.

18:12.742 --> 18:14.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest, never played it.

18:14.383 --> 18:19.766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not my... One out of three Orangels most agree Call of Duty is top notch.

18:20.066 --> 18:20.446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

18:21.383 --> 18:23.866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so burned out on the War Sim.

18:24.006 --> 18:24.827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not my kind of thing.

18:24.847 --> 18:26.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you should borrow mine.

18:26.289 --> 18:27.390
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just not my kind of thing.

18:27.410 --> 18:30.494
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, I will borrow it and give it a chance, but it's just not really my kind of game.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.078
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I got plenty of other crap to play.

18:34.579 --> 18:36.962
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got details for Call of... I said Tooties.

18:37.386 --> 18:39.127
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got details for Call of Duty.

18:39.147 --> 18:39.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Call of Duty.

18:39.767 --> 18:40.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Call of Booty.

18:41.028 --> 18:42.849
[SPEAKER_09]: There should be a new name for Call of Duty.

18:42.869 --> 18:45.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, lots of Call of Duty fans everywhere.

18:45.170 --> 18:47.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got a fan about five times in the past 60 seconds.

18:47.791 --> 18:53.755
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, Call of Duty, you know, if you're going to be calling in, like, duty, that was last week's show, okay?

18:54.135 --> 18:54.715
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty.

18:54.895 --> 18:55.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

18:57.176 --> 18:57.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Call of Duty 3.

18:58.637 --> 19:05.901
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, there's details on the Wii version of Call of Duty 3, which, I don't know how that's going to work out, but, um,

19:06.661 --> 19:27.562
[SPEAKER_09]: at any rate they're basically working on having it they actually don't have a release date scheduled for the Wii release but they are going to say it's going to be released this year speculation is pointing out November around Thanksgiving there hasn't been any real

19:28.687 --> 19:30.048
[SPEAKER_09]: Gameplay, I think.

19:30.709 --> 19:38.834
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just saying, though, that what they're working on is actually using the Wii Remote for position pointing, for that type of thing.

19:40.255 --> 19:43.898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty... It doesn't sound like they're very far along, and they're going to have that thing out at the end of the year?

19:43.918 --> 19:44.819
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty aggressive.

19:45.499 --> 19:46.140
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say so.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.461
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be alarmed at that.

19:47.641 --> 19:53.185
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no matter what type of game it is, if they're still kind of early on here, and they're trying to get that out by the end of the year.

19:53.685 --> 19:56.847
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're basically saying that they're going to center the...

19:57.972 --> 20:00.132
[SPEAKER_09]: Redicule on the screen so that you use the controller.

20:02.033 --> 20:02.733
[SPEAKER_03]: Innovative idea.

20:03.513 --> 20:08.434
[SPEAKER_02]: Different, but... It sounds very similar to Red Steel.

20:09.854 --> 20:11.354
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they move from that.

20:14.015 --> 20:14.315
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

20:14.775 --> 20:15.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we shall move on, yes?

20:18.716 --> 20:19.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's!

20:19.156 --> 20:19.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

20:19.856 --> 20:27.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider was going to be remade for the PSP, but then there was an announcement on Core Design's website that said it was cancelled.

20:28.466 --> 20:38.478
[SPEAKER_03]: The video of Tomb Raider 10th Anniversary that appeared on certain sites was an unauthorized release of an internal presentation of a game that was being developed by Core Design until very recently.

20:38.918 --> 20:41.521
[SPEAKER_03]: It was running on PSP and used Core Developed Engine.

20:41.901 --> 20:45.946
[SPEAKER_03]: However, following a recent review, this project has been officially cancelled by SCI.

20:46.696 --> 20:48.717
[SPEAKER_03]: But is Tomb Raider really cancelled?

20:48.777 --> 20:52.819
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Eurogamer came out and said, no, the remake isn't cancelled.

20:53.299 --> 20:56.941
[SPEAKER_03]: SCI just issued a new statement saying that, hey, it's back on.

20:57.461 --> 21:07.265
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently not only are you going to be able to download Tomb Raider through this whole, you know, PSP, download the PlayStation 1 games thing, but now there's going to be an official remake on the PSP.

21:08.046 --> 21:10.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like there was for Twisted Metal 2.

21:10.527 --> 21:13.528
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Twisted Metal, whatever the hell it was called.

21:13.848 --> 21:14.849
[SPEAKER_02]: I had that game too, and

21:15.799 --> 21:16.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Very disappointing.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.382
[SPEAKER_02]: A launch game that's actually a rehash of an old game.

21:21.383 --> 21:21.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

21:22.484 --> 21:24.486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of burned out on Tomb Raider.

21:24.526 --> 21:29.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider was cool many years ago when it was on the PC and it was cutting edge at the time.

21:29.089 --> 21:31.651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how excited I would be about a remake.

21:31.971 --> 21:36.375
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not a fan of the Xbox 360 one, the recent one that just came out.

21:36.715 --> 21:37.376
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my hands on.

21:37.396 --> 21:38.697
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't for me.

21:40.238 --> 21:40.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

21:40.838 --> 21:42.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of upgrades of old games...

21:43.416 --> 21:45.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Final Fantasy VII.

21:46.459 --> 21:48.901
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen websites taking pre-orders for it.

21:49.762 --> 21:55.867
[SPEAKER_02]: And, well, Square's come out and, of course, said, Final Fantasy VII Remake on PlayStation 3.

21:57.488 --> 22:01.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, we haven't confirmed that's in development.

22:03.334 --> 22:06.596
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have confirmed that Final Fantasy XIII's in development.

22:07.457 --> 22:08.918
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, there's no...

22:10.660 --> 22:14.161
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not working on a Final Fantasy 7 remake Will it happen?

22:14.401 --> 22:34.169
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably So they didn't say no They didn't say no, they're just not working on it They just said, we haven't said it Yeah And fanboys everywhere still have hope And it's basically, we have not confirmed a Final Fantasy remake at any time So, we haven't confirmed it, but we didn't say no Maybe we're doing it, and maybe we're not

22:34.964 --> 22:36.005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to tell you.

22:36.405 --> 22:37.966
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing it, okay?

22:39.167 --> 22:41.448
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just... They're doing it.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.129
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my theory.

22:43.329 --> 22:43.910
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.671
[SPEAKER_03]: If they did it, would anyone care?

22:45.811 --> 22:47.552
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing Final Fantasy everything else.

22:47.612 --> 22:48.032
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

22:48.232 --> 22:52.055
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweak in our chatroom says Final Fantasy VII was good, but it's time to move on, people.

22:52.495 --> 22:53.676
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't mind it looking pretty.

22:54.656 --> 23:00.220
[SPEAKER_03]: Jada2006 seems to think they will move on after one more thing with the Final Fantasy VII franchise.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.041
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be cool to see them remake VI.

23:03.148 --> 23:03.769
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be cool.

23:04.149 --> 23:05.570
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see them go back and do 4 or 6.

23:05.610 --> 23:06.511
[SPEAKER_09]: I did find something cool.

23:07.331 --> 23:11.155
[SPEAKER_09]: On YouTube, I found the Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy 6 demo.

23:11.555 --> 23:13.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, you brought this up on a previous show before.

23:13.456 --> 23:17.119
[SPEAKER_09]: I had been looking and looking and looking, and finally I was like, let me look on YouTube, and the whole thing's there.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everything's on YouTube.

23:19.281 --> 23:22.103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a video on YouTube somewhere, randomly.

23:22.464 --> 23:25.486
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly, though, do wish that they would remake Final Fantasy 7.

23:25.967 --> 23:27.528
[SPEAKER_09]: Not for PlayStation 3, but you know...

23:28.769 --> 23:29.650
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:47.117 --> 23:48.578
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't really use her.

23:49.218 --> 23:50.399
[SPEAKER_03]: You just would be happy she's there.

23:51.140 --> 23:56.364
[SPEAKER_09]: There was basically a whole side quest where if you use a game, it basically is edited out code is what it is.

23:56.384 --> 23:58.486
[SPEAKER_09]: You can run through this quest where you pick up all the stuff.

23:58.846 --> 24:01.548
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you go back into the church and you see her there.

24:01.568 --> 24:04.791
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, on the American version, you see her there, but when you walk forward, she just disappears.

24:05.371 --> 24:06.372
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually bad coding.

24:07.353 --> 24:07.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

24:08.273 --> 24:08.654
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

24:08.834 --> 24:09.975
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole quest is on the Japanese one.

24:10.235 --> 24:10.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

24:11.107 --> 24:12.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VII Remakes

24:42.020 --> 24:45.162
[SPEAKER_09]: I can actually say this because I am female.

24:45.182 --> 24:45.643
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid women drivers!

24:45.663 --> 24:48.965
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm getting back on the freeway after stopping at a truck stop.

25:10.683 --> 25:32.263
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm changing lanes and I signal and get into my lane and start to accelerate and this other woman and her children some type of breeder cow lady was behind a semi and then cuts me off to get in front of me and then she's like finally I just got her out of my way shot past her couldn't deal with that but like she almost clipped the front of my car and then another stupid lady on the way home

25:33.015 --> 25:39.457
[SPEAKER_09]: In an SUV, ha ha ha, decides that she's going to tailgate me for 10 minutes.

25:39.917 --> 25:40.897
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean literally.

25:41.658 --> 25:42.598
[SPEAKER_09]: I even put on my brakes.

25:42.638 --> 25:44.558
[SPEAKER_09]: She almost bumped me.

25:44.598 --> 25:45.159
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crazy.

25:45.519 --> 25:46.699
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she just shoots past me.

25:46.739 --> 25:48.200
[SPEAKER_09]: So finally I said, screw it.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody else is on the road.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.601
[SPEAKER_09]: I got in front of her and speed matched a semi.

25:52.701 --> 25:53.661
[SPEAKER_09]: She turned on her brights.

25:53.981 --> 25:56.142
[SPEAKER_09]: Now keep in mind, she's in an SUV.

25:56.262 --> 25:57.042
[SPEAKER_09]: I drive a Lancer.

25:57.602 --> 25:59.663
[SPEAKER_09]: I am under her lights and I'm short.

26:00.837 --> 26:02.698
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't care, plus I have tinted windows.

26:03.518 --> 26:06.360
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that her bright lights are really gonna mean a damn thing to me?

26:06.460 --> 26:07.080
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a bitch.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.342
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I timed it for exactly 20 minutes.

26:10.462 --> 26:11.442
[SPEAKER_09]: I speed matched a semi.

26:12.983 --> 26:13.703
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I drove up.

26:13.763 --> 26:14.183
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

26:14.524 --> 26:15.444
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she tried to pass me.

26:17.065 --> 26:18.145
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I caught up with her again.

26:19.066 --> 26:20.226
[SPEAKER_09]: And speed matched another semi.

26:21.087 --> 26:21.587
[SPEAKER_09]: For 10 minutes.

26:23.228 --> 26:23.889
[SPEAKER_09]: and then kept going.

26:24.109 --> 26:26.510
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a special place in hell for people like you.

26:27.331 --> 26:27.892
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

26:28.192 --> 26:30.493
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't tailgate people on the freeway.

26:30.553 --> 26:31.694
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, it's dangerous.

26:31.975 --> 26:32.835
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and you know what?

26:32.855 --> 26:34.036
[SPEAKER_09]: She was also on her cell phone.

26:35.357 --> 26:36.858
[SPEAKER_09]: She was on her damn cell phone.

26:37.158 --> 26:43.503
[SPEAKER_09]: Three things I hate is stupid drivers, people driving SUVs and talking on your goddamn cell phone while you're driving.

26:44.164 --> 26:47.026
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there is a special place in hell for people like her.

26:49.127 --> 26:52.590
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where they have 20 cell phones around them and none of them work.

26:54.042 --> 26:54.963
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're all ringing.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.705
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're all ringing with a singular ringtone.

27:00.526 --> 27:00.886
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

27:01.887 --> 27:05.169
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I was, like, so mad.

27:05.229 --> 27:08.531
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep in mind, at this time, I had been on the road for ten hours.

27:09.091 --> 27:12.993
[SPEAKER_09]: To give you some background on this, a friend of mine who lives in San Diego for a convention got really sick.

27:13.393 --> 27:17.156
[SPEAKER_09]: So we drove down to meet her in Bakersfield.

27:17.976 --> 27:18.617
[SPEAKER_09]: And then drove back.

27:18.977 --> 27:20.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is, like, a five hour drive from here.

27:20.598 --> 27:21.418
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I had to drive back.

27:22.259 --> 27:22.459
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

27:23.442 --> 27:26.363
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just really... And I was driving back by myself by this point.

27:26.403 --> 27:30.044
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so worn out and pissed off at the world that I was like, you know what?

27:30.424 --> 27:32.384
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take out all of my road frustrations.

27:32.464 --> 27:34.445
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did it in a completely safe way.

27:34.965 --> 27:40.947
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not do it by speeding, tailgating, or in other ways driving unsafely.

27:41.087 --> 27:42.187
[SPEAKER_09]: I just drove slowly.

27:42.967 --> 27:43.948
[SPEAKER_09]: Speed matching a semi.

27:45.708 --> 27:46.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

27:47.549 --> 27:48.869
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my revenge.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Power to me.

27:50.569 --> 27:51.710
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta keep it moving.

27:52.150 --> 27:52.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki...

27:54.170 --> 27:56.011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I can really follow that.

27:56.071 --> 27:56.531
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

27:56.711 --> 27:59.052
[SPEAKER_02]: She touched all the key points about women drivers.

27:59.732 --> 28:01.733
[SPEAKER_09]: I, however, am an excellent driver.

28:02.833 --> 28:08.975
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because, you know, pacing cars and, you know, getting revenge against drivers is safe driving.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.016
[SPEAKER_09]: I was driving safely.

28:11.836 --> 28:12.617
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't speed.

28:13.477 --> 28:14.457
[SPEAKER_09]: She just couldn't get around me.

28:15.778 --> 28:16.498
[SPEAKER_09]: She was speeding.

28:16.558 --> 28:17.598
[SPEAKER_09]: She was doing 100.

28:18.819 --> 28:20.079
[SPEAKER_09]: I was saving everybody else.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, kids.

28:21.080 --> 28:21.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop fighting.

28:21.600 --> 28:21.800
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

28:22.290 --> 28:26.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I don't really have an FQ of the week, but I'd like to point out an observation.

28:26.412 --> 28:28.493
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to the drag races this weekend.

28:29.053 --> 28:31.634
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, a lot of rednecks like drag racing.

28:31.694 --> 28:37.796
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I swear to God, about half the people there didn't have shirts on, had tattoos, and drinking their beer with their kids.

28:38.056 --> 28:38.837
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what, though?

28:40.357 --> 28:41.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Jet cars are awesome.

28:42.018 --> 28:43.198
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes it worth it.

28:43.538 --> 28:45.079
[SPEAKER_02]: It appeals to the redneck in me.

28:45.379 --> 28:47.460
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching a car go 260 miles an hour down, you know, a quarter mile.

28:53.452 --> 28:57.434
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to Light Rail and some of the people that ride it.

28:57.954 --> 29:02.837
[SPEAKER_03]: I had jury duty this week, which I had for the past two and a half weeks, which finally ended this week.

29:02.897 --> 29:03.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

29:03.417 --> 29:03.897
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.

29:04.518 --> 29:06.018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an important civic duty, though.

29:06.619 --> 29:15.603
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in America, if it's not going to disrupt your schedule, you're not in school or whatever, and your work will compensate for you being there, I say go.

29:15.963 --> 29:21.566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really great educational experience, but don't ride the Light Rail to the courthouse because there are some

29:22.085 --> 29:23.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Just rude people that write it.

29:24.146 --> 29:24.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

29:25.366 --> 29:26.226
[SPEAKER_09]: And scully people.

29:26.486 --> 29:27.366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all of it.

29:27.906 --> 29:28.227
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.187
[SPEAKER_03]: So, F you to Light Rail.

29:29.347 --> 29:31.187
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, if I may, Rob, do you have an addendum?

29:31.687 --> 29:31.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

29:32.107 --> 29:34.688
[SPEAKER_09]: I did actually speed up when I saw somebody else's lights behind her.

29:35.048 --> 29:35.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

29:37.829 --> 29:38.149
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

29:39.349 --> 29:41.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Is chat room giving you a little crap for your story, DarkSakura?

29:41.750 --> 29:42.070
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

29:42.170 --> 29:43.350
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some folks cheering you on.

29:43.370 --> 29:44.391
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting kudos so far.

29:44.651 --> 29:46.031
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some folks cheering you on there.

29:46.631 --> 29:46.971
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

29:47.291 --> 29:50.352
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say I was only punishing her and nobody else.

29:51.188 --> 29:57.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we had a story on backwards compatibility earlier and you have somewhat of a footnote to that story.

29:58.053 --> 29:58.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

29:59.774 --> 30:05.837
[SPEAKER_02]: A certain someone named Tim Schafer is a little pissed off that his game Psychonauts isn't backwards compatible on the 360.

30:07.625 --> 30:20.509
[SPEAKER_02]: He's basically offered up to fly down his team to help make it happen, but Microsoft assured him, as well as everybody else, that they're on top of it.

30:20.549 --> 30:29.032
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got their top men on the job, so he's not too happy about that, as well as fans of Psychonauts.

30:29.072 --> 30:32.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you be seeing Psychonauts on 360 anytime soon?

30:33.474 --> 30:34.394
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, but probably not.

30:37.150 --> 30:39.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the next update, which at the going rate will be in about four months.

30:41.072 --> 30:41.812
[SPEAKER_03]: About, maybe.

30:43.833 --> 30:46.594
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they get Krusty Demons to work on there, because that looks funny.

30:47.294 --> 30:52.276
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, BMX XXX was censored on the Xbox.

30:52.396 --> 30:52.976
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

30:53.156 --> 30:54.497
[SPEAKER_02]: What system did we play it on?

30:54.517 --> 30:56.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you used to have it with GameCube.

30:56.617 --> 30:57.858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a weird system.

30:57.898 --> 31:01.519
[SPEAKER_02]: My sister and her boyfriend are borrowing it indefinitely.

31:01.539 --> 31:02.180
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fun, fun.

31:03.905 --> 31:09.947
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, there was a movie at the box office, or a movie that did pretty well at the box office this week, and maybe it'll be a game now?

31:10.748 --> 31:11.348
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

31:12.188 --> 31:20.091
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, I haven't been to see it, I really want to, but Nacho Libre has been licensed by Majesco.

31:21.732 --> 31:23.272
[SPEAKER_09]: What has Majesco done lately?

31:25.893 --> 31:28.134
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, to be honest.

31:28.214 --> 31:33.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe their Wikipedia would clue us into that, I'm assuming, because Wikipedia has all this useless stuff on it.

31:33.783 --> 31:37.944
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically the game's going to be done by Budcat Creations.

31:38.004 --> 31:41.866
[SPEAKER_09]: They brought out Psychonauts and Madden NFL 2006.

31:44.366 --> 31:48.728
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is going to be, from what I'm seeing, it's going to be on the Nintendo DS.

31:50.008 --> 31:53.929
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be the first Nintendo DS game on the US and European market.

31:54.970 --> 31:56.290
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will have Nacho Libre!

31:57.570 --> 31:58.731
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also a mention that...

32:00.134 --> 32:05.608
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to obtain the right to the Ghost Rider movie, but I think Take-Two got it instead.

32:07.337 --> 32:10.280
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that Ghost Rider game at E3 and it got awful.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.581
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have given it to somebody else.

32:11.661 --> 32:12.802
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it was awful.

32:13.122 --> 32:15.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of games and movies, I completely forgot.

32:16.184 --> 32:23.370
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill, the movie, is actually coming to DVD August 22nd in the United States, so look forward to that.

32:23.890 --> 32:31.476
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have some DVD commentaries on there, plus the origins of Silent Hill and some other stuff.

32:31.576 --> 32:32.637
[SPEAKER_02]: No UFO ending!

32:32.937 --> 32:35.439
[SPEAKER_07]: It better have a UFO ending as an Easter egg.

32:35.499 --> 32:36.060
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the dog.

32:37.324 --> 32:39.345
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:07.808 --> 33:09.569
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a big fan of Mexican wrestling.

33:26.984 --> 33:30.986
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of politically oriented stories in the first half of the show, and this kind of follows that.

33:31.026 --> 33:36.769
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESRB is now threatening $1 million game rating fines.

33:37.330 --> 33:38.010
[SPEAKER_11]: $1 million!

33:38.230 --> 33:39.291
[SPEAKER_03]: $1 million!

33:39.351 --> 33:46.795
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESRB is raising this maximum penalty for a publisher who fails to disclose objectionable content.

33:47.235 --> 33:50.337
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't leave your nudity on the disc.

33:51.041 --> 33:54.603
[SPEAKER_03]: because some hacker might find it and your company is going to get sued for one million.

33:54.683 --> 33:55.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my question though.

33:55.724 --> 33:58.145
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how they have their rating system and stuff.

33:58.605 --> 34:09.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I for a fact know that anime, like ADV for example, they do not have ratings that are done by the MPAA.

34:09.351 --> 34:17.435
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their own ratings that they put on there that are completely independent and yet they are sold in stores out there.

34:17.455 --> 34:18.416
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not betting them.

34:19.196 --> 34:21.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Who gives a crap if they get sued a million dollars?

34:21.617 --> 34:25.938
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't they self-rate their games and still be able to put them out in the store?

34:25.998 --> 34:30.859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to get to that, is that the ESRB, you know, you might be asking, well, what happens if they don't pay the one million dollars?

34:30.879 --> 34:41.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what the ESRB can do is revoke the rating services, and that will screw you when it comes to getting into Walmart and GameStop and all that stuff, which doesn't carry games that aren't branded.

34:43.242 --> 34:45.403
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have the AO rating, I should point out.

34:46.134 --> 34:57.016
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you raise a good point, but at the same time with the video games getting all this negative publicity in the sense of these laws, I don't know if a video game company would be able to get away with it the same way a movie company can.

34:58.156 --> 35:00.156
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, I mean, because they're rated.

35:00.256 --> 35:05.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Anime is kind of its own, in the sense of movies, it's kind of its own specialty world anyway.

35:05.477 --> 35:09.038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the ESRB is like kind of an independent company anyways.

35:09.458 --> 35:15.099
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they have to be, you know, the one out there that says what the game is rated?

35:15.526 --> 35:17.727
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't there be another rating system out there?

35:17.947 --> 35:20.109
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it really need to be this one company?

35:20.449 --> 35:24.311
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about it, they're putting these companies through a lot of stupid shit.

35:24.571 --> 35:27.333
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole hot coffee thing was ridiculous to begin with.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.095
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that they're threatening $1 million fines.

35:30.115 --> 35:31.275
[SPEAKER_02]: $1 million for what?

35:31.956 --> 35:34.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's going to teach them what?

35:34.377 --> 35:35.418
[SPEAKER_02]: To not go with you?

35:35.498 --> 35:35.958
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal.

35:36.078 --> 35:37.479
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's an independent company.

35:37.519 --> 35:38.900
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see what the big deal is.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.921
[SPEAKER_02]: Just self-rate your games.

35:41.551 --> 35:44.313
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we did before we even had these ESRB things.

35:44.574 --> 35:46.995
[SPEAKER_02]: It either didn't have a rating or they were self-rated.

35:47.075 --> 35:48.917
[SPEAKER_02]: So, big deal.

35:49.097 --> 35:49.517
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

35:52.460 --> 35:54.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, take us to our next story.

35:55.022 --> 35:58.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of craziness, I swear to God it should be a segment on this show.

35:58.825 --> 36:01.707
[SPEAKER_02]: What crazy thing did Sony say this week?

36:02.287 --> 36:07.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Kutaragi, he came out and said...

36:09.208 --> 36:17.112
[SPEAKER_02]: As the PlayStation 3 is a computer, we might even offer it on a build-to-order basis, customized to the needs of each and every user.

36:18.833 --> 36:19.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

36:19.953 --> 36:20.714
[SPEAKER_02]: You are retarded.

36:21.314 --> 36:23.475
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a gateway PlayStation 3?

36:23.515 --> 36:25.816
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a PC?

36:25.936 --> 36:26.897
[SPEAKER_09]: A gate station?

36:27.437 --> 36:28.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you're getting a PS3.

36:28.798 --> 36:29.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

36:30.859 --> 36:31.779
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a PC.

36:32.339 --> 36:32.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

36:34.841 --> 36:36.441
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony seems to really be working that.

36:36.521 --> 36:37.542
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a computer angle.

36:38.234 --> 36:40.075
[SPEAKER_09]: All that to avoid taxes in the UK.

36:40.095 --> 36:42.157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

36:42.697 --> 36:44.218
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get it.

36:44.459 --> 36:47.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of people in power at companies, did you hear this?

36:47.621 --> 36:51.263
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't maybe directly affect gaming, but it is important to note.

36:51.864 --> 36:58.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerds everywhere were noting that Bill Gates has announced that he's stepping down from his head position at Microsoft in 2008.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.381
[SPEAKER_03]: and what's going to happen after July of 2008.

37:02.161 --> 37:05.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Gates will kind of function only in like an advisory role.

37:05.762 --> 37:07.763
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not going to really be doing the day-to-day functions.

37:07.803 --> 37:09.024
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll just sit back and make money on it.

37:09.124 --> 37:14.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he wants to focus on the charity stuff, which is cool, and it's got him a lot of notoriety in recent years, right?

37:14.126 --> 37:15.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't he People of the Year?

37:16.407 --> 37:18.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it last year or the year before with his wife and Bono?

37:19.048 --> 37:19.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

37:19.188 --> 37:19.908
[SPEAKER_02]: For their charity work?

37:19.968 --> 37:22.569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised he's being able to retire in two years.

37:22.609 --> 37:24.470
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't he going to go broke like tomorrow?

37:25.718 --> 37:26.859
[SPEAKER_02]: I somehow doubt that.

37:27.260 --> 37:29.362
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the billions of dollars that he's making.

37:30.283 --> 37:31.745
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be really struggling.

37:31.785 --> 37:33.227
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have to cut back.

37:37.157 --> 37:42.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Expect to see Ray Ozzie, who is the Chief Technical Officer, start to kind of take on a bigger role there.

37:43.442 --> 37:54.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Not saying he's necessarily going to be a replacement, but he's going to assume the title of Chief Software Architect and work side-by-side with Gates on technical architecture and product oversight responsibilities.

37:54.991 --> 38:00.235
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might start seeing some of those other folks there at Microsoft starting to fill the shoes of Bill Gates.

38:01.836 --> 38:05.599
[SPEAKER_03]: One person whose shoes cannot be filled is the great and terrible Dark Sakura.

38:06.482 --> 38:08.884
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, who's emailing us this week?

38:34.850 --> 38:37.553
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, tonight I actually just have three emails.

38:38.153 --> 38:46.461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because I got one that wasn't really a particularly appropriate question, and then a few others that were just sight suggestions.

38:46.721 --> 38:50.084
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, thank you to our friend Rob with two Bs.

38:50.244 --> 38:54.148
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we have our first email comes from Matt in the UK.

38:55.809 --> 38:56.450
[SPEAKER_09]: He's really awesome.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.703
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that your show is awesome.

38:58.823 --> 39:02.684
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wish that I lived in a different time zone so I can listen to your shows live.

39:03.104 --> 39:04.445
[SPEAKER_09]: I listen to your podcasts all the time.

39:04.545 --> 39:07.666
[SPEAKER_09]: I always learn something new when I listen to OLR and you guys always make me laugh.

39:08.326 --> 39:08.706
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

39:09.627 --> 39:12.107
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if you've ever thought of coming down to the UK sometime.

39:12.668 --> 39:14.969
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the odd convention going on here and there.

39:15.069 --> 39:18.770
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do come down here sometime, it would make me the happiest pretty on the aisle.

39:19.468 --> 39:22.070
[SPEAKER_09]: Your show is amazing and I hope you carry on for many years to come.

39:34.941 --> 39:35.861
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:52.118 --> 39:58.763
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do SakuraCon next year, which I'm understanding we've already been approved guests or whatever, we're going to have to pay for that to go there.

39:58.783 --> 40:03.246
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be driving our way to Washington.

40:03.466 --> 40:07.089
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to help us out with plane money, sure we'll come.

40:07.563 --> 40:09.003
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to check out the UK.

40:09.043 --> 40:09.884
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always wanted to go there.

40:09.904 --> 40:11.764
[SPEAKER_08]: We should start to send Orange Lounge to Britain.

40:11.824 --> 40:13.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see.

40:13.385 --> 40:13.745
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

40:14.325 --> 40:15.926
[SPEAKER_03]: So someday.

40:16.026 --> 40:16.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't count it out.

40:17.226 --> 40:20.067
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I still want to go there to travel, so I will pay for it someday.

40:20.127 --> 40:24.188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just hopefully Orange Lounge Radio is still around next year and years.

40:24.228 --> 40:26.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know it will be, but, you know, when I can afford it.

40:27.890 --> 40:32.391
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I got actually a non-story email from Rob.

40:33.687 --> 40:43.194
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just an idea I have, but if Pin Mame and Wii use the Wii-type control scheme, realistic nudges could be modeled for the first time on a home game in those virtual tables that you talked about last week.

40:43.794 --> 40:46.916
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, nothing comes close to a full-thrust nudge on a table with no tilt.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think it's got to be Pin Mame.

40:49.678 --> 40:52.540
[SPEAKER_03]: I think any pinball simulator on the Wii could incorporate that idea.

40:52.560 --> 40:53.421
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a dang good idea.

40:55.082 --> 41:00.546
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also have one from, I think, another map.

41:01.813 --> 41:14.465
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to let you know that on www.abtelectronics.com they have the PS3 available for pre-order.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.567
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing is that you can't really pre-order it.

41:17.108 --> 41:21.572
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of the add to cart button it is replaced with an authorized button which takes you to nowhere.

41:21.792 --> 41:22.613
[SPEAKER_09]: You should check it out.

41:22.773 --> 41:25.816
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to the website and click on video game consoles under video games tab.

41:26.743 --> 41:30.546
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, buddy, but I've never heard of that site, and I would never buy a system from a site.

41:30.566 --> 41:32.887
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never dropped $600 on a site I've never heard of.

41:33.308 --> 41:43.114
[SPEAKER_03]: But you give a good chance for us to bring up this opportunity to say, don't buy from places that you don't have a trust in.

41:43.194 --> 41:48.378
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know this company, so I'm not trying to knock it, but I've never heard of it.

41:49.439 --> 41:54.202
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you get anything like that, your best friend for any internet ordering place is...

41:55.268 --> 41:57.489
[SPEAKER_09]: and the Better Business Bureau website.

41:58.010 --> 42:00.992
[SPEAKER_09]: Check anything out before you order online.

42:01.172 --> 42:03.393
[SPEAKER_09]: Read their feedback or you could really be burned.

42:04.834 --> 42:07.736
[SPEAKER_09]: And just make sure that you do your research before you go through any of those websites.

42:07.756 --> 42:09.377
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I wanted to bring that email up.

42:10.298 --> 42:12.659
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it is funny that they're taking pre-orders that go to nowhere.

42:14.360 --> 42:17.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just something they want to make and it's broken or I don't know.

42:17.522 --> 42:18.283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming soon.

42:18.323 --> 42:18.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

42:19.223 --> 42:19.503
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be.

42:19.743 --> 42:20.324
[SPEAKER_09]: Under construction.

42:20.764 --> 42:23.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody in chat room is saying anything about that site so I don't know.

42:23.446 --> 42:23.686
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

42:24.906 --> 42:25.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

42:26.228 --> 42:26.749
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be all.

42:26.889 --> 42:28.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, send us more email.

42:28.172 --> 42:34.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, meanwhile, you want to be a beta tester?

42:35.287 --> 42:41.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if you do, then you better head on over to Atari's website.

42:42.452 --> 42:48.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they're doing an online beta test for the PlayStation 2 version of their new Test Drive Unlimited.

42:49.698 --> 42:57.284
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can go and sign up right now at www.atari.com slash TDU beta test.

42:58.144 --> 42:58.305
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

42:59.235 --> 43:00.696
[SPEAKER_02]: You can basically sign up there.

43:00.756 --> 43:06.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're saying that you're going to be under a strict non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.

43:07.801 --> 43:08.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Standard.

43:08.422 --> 43:15.146
[SPEAKER_02]: You will need to have a PlayStation 2 console, including a broadband internet connection and network adapter.

43:17.168 --> 43:17.448
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

43:18.369 --> 43:20.310
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, be sure to check that out.

43:21.311 --> 43:22.692
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, though, if I am picked...

43:24.175 --> 43:25.516
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not bite by that indie.

43:49.378 --> 43:51.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Please give these guys a call first.

43:51.598 --> 43:52.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Echo 123.

43:53.799 --> 43:55.559
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to add them to their friends list.

43:55.599 --> 43:58.400
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have told me, well, I tried calling you, but they wouldn't accept my friend invite.

43:58.600 --> 43:59.160
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to.

43:59.200 --> 43:59.820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a computer.

44:00.060 --> 44:04.681
[SPEAKER_03]: You just put that in as your call, and it'll pick up right away, and you can hear what you sound like.

44:04.761 --> 44:06.441
[SPEAKER_03]: So please give them a call first.

44:06.822 --> 44:07.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you sound good.

44:07.922 --> 44:08.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Then give us a call.

44:08.922 --> 44:10.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, we get angry.

44:11.142 --> 44:14.003
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be right after this story about the DS Lights.

44:14.663 --> 44:17.064
[SPEAKER_03]: on Japanese airline JAL.

44:17.424 --> 44:24.328
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be offering their first class and executive class passengers DS Lights to play during the flight's duration.

44:25.028 --> 44:28.110
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a special promotion that's going on until August 31st.

44:28.650 --> 44:31.751
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think you have to be in Japan to use this, no.

44:32.131 --> 44:43.497
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, the routes would include Tokyo, New York City, Tokyo, Chicago, Tokyo, LA, Tokyo, San Francisco, Tokyo, London, Tokyo, Beijing, and one other one, Tokyo, Guangzhou.

44:44.722 --> 44:46.404
[SPEAKER_03]: If I horribly butchered that, I'm sorry.

44:47.344 --> 44:52.448
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have JAL going to Tokyo from where you are, chances are you'll have a chance to do this.

44:53.408 --> 45:01.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the DS Lite's Wi-Fi capabilities have been taken out because you're not supposed to have wireless and all that stuff interfering on the planes.

45:01.794 --> 45:11.260
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you will get a chance to do a Japanese brain training game, an English brain training game, Otona no DS Golf, and Mario Kart.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.762
[SPEAKER_09]: So no snaking on a plane?

45:18.921 --> 45:19.581
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

45:20.902 --> 45:23.083
[SPEAKER_03]: That's got to be one of the worst jokes ever told on this show.

45:23.123 --> 45:23.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

45:24.484 --> 45:25.165
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm full of them.

45:25.445 --> 45:26.105
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll keep them coming.

45:26.145 --> 45:28.126
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been borrowing from 23Megas.

45:28.566 --> 45:28.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

45:28.947 --> 45:32.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, our... The roll of toilet paper is right here.

45:33.229 --> 45:36.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Skype line is open over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

45:36.591 --> 45:38.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Interact With Us or you can pick up your phone and call 916-226-9067.

45:38.812 --> 45:38.893
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

45:41.914 --> 45:41.954
[SPEAKER_03]: D.S.

45:41.994 --> 45:42.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Light D.S.

45:42.595 --> 45:42.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Light

46:04.505 --> 46:07.406
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, a thousand of them got stolen in Hong Kong.

46:07.586 --> 46:08.406
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard about this.

46:08.486 --> 46:12.166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Luminous' fault because it taught us how to move crates, remember?

46:12.866 --> 46:13.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they sure did.

46:14.927 --> 46:16.047
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about that?

46:16.087 --> 46:19.268
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is that... I think it's crazy.

46:19.448 --> 46:20.388
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's crazy?

46:21.028 --> 46:21.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

46:21.228 --> 46:22.908
[SPEAKER_03]: Because somebody was able to get away with it?

46:23.028 --> 46:23.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Stealing all that?

46:23.728 --> 46:24.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

46:25.469 --> 46:27.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't you watch 24?

46:27.629 --> 46:29.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone like Jack Bauer can do anything.

46:30.210 --> 46:31.330
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you're right, but he's dead.

46:32.210 --> 46:32.810
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not dead.

46:33.499 --> 46:34.999
[SPEAKER_13]: If he died, the show wouldn't continue.

46:35.820 --> 46:36.860
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, one of the geeks died.

46:36.900 --> 46:37.600
[SPEAKER_13]: That made me sad.

46:37.640 --> 46:38.660
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, anyway, this is about games.

46:38.680 --> 46:39.461
[SPEAKER_13]: This is about games.

46:39.521 --> 46:40.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to say about DS Lite?

46:41.961 --> 46:43.322
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but I have a question for you.

46:44.042 --> 46:44.382
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

46:45.042 --> 46:45.902
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question for you.

46:46.142 --> 46:46.482
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what?

46:46.522 --> 46:46.722
[SPEAKER_13]: Me?

46:46.822 --> 46:47.223
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what?

46:48.663 --> 46:52.544
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the longest loading screen you ever encountered in a game?

46:54.343 --> 46:56.604
[SPEAKER_03]: of recent memory, Final Fantasy XI.

46:56.664 --> 46:57.284
[SPEAKER_03]: We timed it.

46:57.304 --> 47:01.185
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes 1 minute 59 seconds to get from boot up into the actual game.

47:01.625 --> 47:03.425
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may not sound like a long time, but it is.

47:04.186 --> 47:06.526
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultramix 3 also had a pretty horrible load time.

47:06.546 --> 47:08.907
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes like a minute to get in there after the title screen.

47:08.947 --> 47:09.587
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty bad.

47:09.807 --> 47:11.367
[SPEAKER_09]: Any of the KLF games on Saturn.

47:11.847 --> 47:12.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

47:12.948 --> 47:14.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto's got a pretty bad one.

47:14.448 --> 47:18.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Oblivion does too, but I can understand an Oblivion's case because once you get in there, it's pretty good.

47:18.649 --> 47:21.970
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Street Fighter Alpha on the Super Nintendo had loading time.

47:22.430 --> 47:22.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

47:23.257 --> 47:23.517
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

47:23.898 --> 47:24.478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it did.

47:24.538 --> 47:25.139
[SPEAKER_09]: It was horrible.

47:25.419 --> 47:34.926
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd go to the scene, and then a character would pop up after 30 seconds, and then another character would pop up, and then the voice would load in, and then it would start.

47:35.246 --> 47:36.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chat room's taking an opportunity.

47:36.788 --> 47:37.268
[SPEAKER_13]: One more thing.

47:37.368 --> 47:37.728
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sure.

47:38.749 --> 47:44.234
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a custom-built Super Nintendo controller that is custom-made for a computer.

47:45.114 --> 47:45.755
[SPEAKER_13]: Where'd you get this?

47:45.775 --> 47:46.956
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this something you did yourself?

47:47.776 --> 47:48.657
[SPEAKER_13]: I ordered it.

47:49.217 --> 47:49.458
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

47:50.058 --> 47:52.040
[SPEAKER_13]: I ordered it online on eBay.

47:52.280 --> 47:52.360
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

47:52.898 --> 47:53.378
[SPEAKER_13]: How's it work?

47:54.259 --> 47:54.659
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

47:54.839 --> 47:55.559
[SPEAKER_13]: Works perfectly.

47:56.339 --> 47:59.100
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just using a bunch of different converters?

47:59.121 --> 48:04.583
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's a Super Nintendo controller that is USB interface and it works great with all emulators.

48:04.703 --> 48:05.603
[SPEAKER_13]: And you got this on eBay?

48:06.363 --> 48:06.784
[SPEAKER_13]: On eBay.

48:06.924 --> 48:07.964
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you remember the seller's name?

48:08.204 --> 48:09.165
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can recommend it?

48:09.825 --> 48:12.086
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't know the website.

48:12.146 --> 48:13.366
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy makes all of them.

48:13.386 --> 48:15.067
[SPEAKER_13]: He even made a Power Glove.

48:16.192 --> 48:16.933
[SPEAKER_13]: ComputerOne.

48:17.153 --> 48:17.453
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

48:17.533 --> 48:24.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, do you remember, though, the people who made the PC out of the Nintendo?

48:26.299 --> 48:28.300
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember someone did an Atari one.

48:28.721 --> 48:40.329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the site's gone now, but he was actually building them for people and selling, and he was making the controller into a USB and also converting the Super Nintendo mouse into a PC mouse.

48:41.883 --> 48:43.123
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, they do have that on.

48:43.284 --> 48:44.104
[SPEAKER_13]: I did see that.

48:44.604 --> 48:45.224
[SPEAKER_13]: The mouse one.

48:45.244 --> 48:45.884
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to buy it.

48:46.705 --> 48:47.685
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like $24.

48:48.045 --> 48:49.866
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was building it basically out of laptop parts.

48:50.486 --> 48:54.787
[SPEAKER_09]: And just putting a USB connector instead of the regular plug-in.

48:55.388 --> 48:56.368
[SPEAKER_09]: And setting up drivers for it.

48:59.321 --> 49:03.982
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin, I want to point out as well, the chat room is giving quite a response to your question about load times.

49:04.022 --> 49:06.644
[SPEAKER_03]: HitStun saying, Half-Life 2 takes me forever to load.

49:07.004 --> 49:11.505
[SPEAKER_03]: YouWillBowToMe says, MidnightClubDub for PSP has hella load times.

49:12.206 --> 49:12.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.

49:13.026 --> 49:17.208
[SPEAKER_03]: XanderK says, The Sims 2 for PSP has the crappiest loads ever.

49:18.708 --> 49:21.129
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, I didn't expect such a response to this.

49:21.550 --> 49:22.690
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just a random question.

49:23.290 --> 49:25.331
[SPEAKER_03]: See how easy it is to get a response out of people?

49:25.391 --> 49:27.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get on a microphone and start yelling.

49:28.444 --> 49:30.646
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I know you got a bunch of calls, so I'm going to let it go.

49:30.686 --> 49:31.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got a couple.

49:31.607 --> 49:32.968
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, Ravenstolphin.

49:32.988 --> 49:33.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the call.

49:33.889 --> 49:34.149
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

49:36.070 --> 49:36.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

49:37.872 --> 49:39.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

49:39.353 --> 49:39.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

49:40.774 --> 49:41.515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Diginova.

49:41.955 --> 49:42.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Diginova.

49:43.477 --> 49:44.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?

49:44.197 --> 49:45.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let you know it's sunrise here at the moment.

49:45.979 --> 49:46.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

49:46.539 --> 49:47.720
[SPEAKER_03]: What time is it over there?

49:48.541 --> 49:49.882
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 4.30 in the morning.

49:50.002 --> 49:52.404
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell where you're from from the sound of your voice.

49:52.444 --> 49:53.965
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, wow, mightily.

49:53.985 --> 49:54.606
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound tired.

49:55.960 --> 50:02.763
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to go to bed at midnight, but I asked my fiancé, could I please just stay up and listen to you guys because I've got the time off because I've just changed jobs.

50:03.204 --> 50:04.404
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank your fiancé for us.

50:04.764 --> 50:06.805
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for being so dedicated.

50:06.845 --> 50:07.566
[SPEAKER_03]: You're crazy.

50:07.626 --> 50:08.066
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

50:08.486 --> 50:09.026
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

50:09.046 --> 50:10.087
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to share with listeners?

50:11.127 --> 50:12.228
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually two points.

50:12.248 --> 50:14.509
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'll make it quick because I know you guys got other people calling.

50:14.669 --> 50:19.531
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I was watching the TV show called Gamer TV.

50:19.571 --> 50:20.432
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here in Bravo.

50:20.452 --> 50:22.673
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Sky thing, Rupert Murdoch thing anyway.

50:23.115 --> 50:24.556
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say we get that over here.

50:24.576 --> 50:27.117
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they used to show that on a G4 at some point?

50:27.277 --> 50:28.038
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamer TV?

50:28.178 --> 50:28.478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

50:28.758 --> 50:31.160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different network though, but yeah.

50:31.540 --> 50:32.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

50:32.641 --> 50:32.921
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

50:34.342 --> 50:50.631
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, in backing up what you were saying about games and parents and the rest, but this one in particular was about a doctor in Chicago saying games are very good and how they influence the mind and how keyhole surgery it was, I've forgotten what his name was, it's on there, but it was

50:51.058 --> 50:54.199
[SPEAKER_01]: Really interesting to the point of you saying how games were influencing.

50:54.219 --> 50:55.540
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought I'd bring that up.

50:55.800 --> 50:59.842
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second point was, when the hell are they going to release OutRun for the backwards compatibility?

50:59.882 --> 51:02.162
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one reason why I kept my game.

51:02.182 --> 51:02.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

51:02.803 --> 51:04.423
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that guy.

51:06.801 --> 51:08.982
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:27.033 --> 51:32.055
[SPEAKER_03]: I read it in a psychological journal.

51:32.576 --> 51:43.301
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually read a test in a psychological journal that was talking about reaction times, especially when playing puzzle games, RPGs, versus non-gamers, and that the gamer group came out way ahead.

51:44.101 --> 51:46.582
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too bad our politicians don't seem to be counting any of that.

51:47.442 --> 51:51.844
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's nothing over here in the same sort of politics way going towards gaming.

51:52.505 --> 51:53.025
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

51:54.944 --> 51:56.345
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it over there?

51:56.405 --> 52:04.430
[SPEAKER_03]: While I've got a UK listener on the phone, I can kind of ask, what is the impression over there of what is going on over here with the gaming laws?

52:04.590 --> 52:10.334
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is it we're a bunch of crazies over here in America, or is it, well, the same thing's happening over here?

52:10.994 --> 52:11.435
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

52:31.533 --> 52:32.934
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's rude, but in a funny way.

52:53.870 --> 52:56.713
[SPEAKER_03]: I was laughing to him and saying, that's not good customer service.

52:56.753 --> 52:57.554
[SPEAKER_01]: You work in a bank.

52:57.914 --> 53:01.097
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rude, rude, and then there's rude funny.

53:01.337 --> 53:02.358
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan's rude funny.

53:02.979 --> 53:04.660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.182
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow or another, he gets away with it.

53:06.282 --> 53:12.247
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually, I work for a bank myself, and there's a big difference in the level of customer, though.

53:13.288 --> 53:15.911
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, over here, we've got, like, it's just a local bank.

53:16.011 --> 53:19.334
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's national, it's owned by RBS, World Bank of Scotland, but

53:20.131 --> 53:20.792
[SPEAKER_01]: Outrun Outrun Outrun Outrun

53:38.890 --> 54:07.687
[SPEAKER_03]: usually when they get one they get about like 20 because you know they weren't targeting that Barbie adventure game and I don't know how many times I've said this to people when they bitch about why is Barbie emulatable and you know Outrun isn't well because not that I'm saying this because Mattel paid for it well no because Barbie is probably very similar in it's design to I don't know Halo or one of the games that is already playable I'm not trying to say Barbie's like Halo but you know

54:08.511 --> 54:09.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to...

54:10.132 --> 54:11.893
[SPEAKER_03]: 8-bit and 16-bit emulation.

54:11.933 --> 54:12.933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost the same way.

54:12.993 --> 54:14.854
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, the NES games.

54:15.314 --> 54:18.135
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of NES games are assigned to certain mappers.

54:18.175 --> 54:22.096
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get into too much detail, but all the NES games are on certain mappers.

54:22.616 --> 54:34.159
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a lot of these obscure Japanese titles, the reason why those were the last ones to be emulated on NES emulators is because their mappers were not one of the standard... I think there's like five or six standard ones.

54:34.800 --> 54:36.140
[SPEAKER_03]: The crazy ones are outside of that.

54:36.180 --> 54:38.961
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have to basically write new code for each mapper.

54:39.681 --> 54:42.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that idea and apply it to Xbox and Xbox 360.

54:43.322 --> 54:45.283
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what's going on.

54:45.323 --> 54:50.664
[SPEAKER_03]: When you unlock one big game, you might unlock a bunch of little crappy ones that were similar in design.

54:51.125 --> 54:54.025
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not that Xbox is targeting those crap games.

54:54.105 --> 54:57.987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that it just happens that they work so it can just boost their numbers.

54:58.067 --> 54:58.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yippee!

55:00.847 --> 55:03.428
[SPEAKER_01]: It raises the whole situation you said about PlayStation 3.

55:03.468 --> 55:05.529
[SPEAKER_01]: They put simply just a PlayStation in there.

55:05.589 --> 55:06.029
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, with the

55:06.647 --> 55:07.268
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for calling in.

55:07.288 --> 55:08.028
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for calling in.

55:32.409 --> 55:32.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleep well!

55:34.390 --> 55:35.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever he finally goes to sleep there.

55:36.471 --> 55:41.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to point out here in the chatroom, BlackWolf, our buddy Bobby, over on... They're on Captain N again.

55:42.193 --> 55:42.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

55:42.633 --> 55:43.733
[SPEAKER_09]: They're on Captain N again.

55:43.753 --> 55:44.474
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, not Bobby.

55:44.514 --> 55:48.995
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's saying, well, he might be somewhere else, but Bobby is saying that they did target Big Mother Truckers.

55:51.456 --> 55:51.776
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

55:52.376 --> 55:54.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a certain demographic that goes for that, you know.

55:54.837 --> 55:57.138
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all... I know, I know.

55:57.698 --> 55:58.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do one more call here.

55:58.759 --> 55:59.759
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

55:59.779 --> 56:00.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

56:00.459 --> 56:01.640
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one and only man.

56:02.265 --> 56:08.589
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one and only choppy Legend of Zaku, who's choppy, choppy in and out, who needs to turn off the porn torrents.

56:08.629 --> 56:09.029
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

56:09.289 --> 56:09.649
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

56:10.610 --> 56:17.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I got word on the street that Supernova's coming out this Wednesday in Dave & Buster's in Times Square.

56:17.594 --> 56:22.137
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the three or four listeners we have in Times Square, they're going to be really happy.

56:22.797 --> 56:30.562
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, I mean, it's been confirmed by folks who have been, who are on the inside of the company and the people that work there, so...

56:31.511 --> 56:36.014
[SPEAKER_10]: And since I'm 21, that's a definite of me actually going there that Wednesday.

56:36.154 --> 56:39.075
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, hooray for you, but what about the rest of us?

56:39.716 --> 56:41.096
[SPEAKER_09]: We have listeners in New York.

56:41.216 --> 56:42.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that.

56:42.837 --> 56:47.120
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but we have lots of listeners, a fraction of which live in New York.

56:47.420 --> 56:49.361
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm trying to get at, here's what I'm trying to get at.

56:49.381 --> 56:54.964
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is, is this going to be a trend for Dave and Buster's?

56:55.609 --> 56:57.150
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's lots of Dave and Buster's everywhere.

56:57.170 --> 57:03.314
[SPEAKER_10]: I think from what I'm hearing is that they're going to phase out their pump-it-up machines and supernovas.

57:03.694 --> 57:05.595
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, Miklatov's going to be pissed.

57:06.116 --> 57:07.357
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm hearing right there.

57:07.417 --> 57:09.338
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to use that as a replacement.

57:09.458 --> 57:10.979
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the DDR's gone legit here.

57:11.859 --> 57:12.200
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

57:12.760 --> 57:14.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see what happens.

57:15.010 --> 57:16.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with your Supernova.

57:16.630 --> 57:17.531
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess take pictures.

57:17.571 --> 57:18.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us a review.

57:18.591 --> 57:22.452
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want any reviews or any info, I should be able to provide it by next Sunday.

57:22.672 --> 57:25.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't want to sound like a jerk, but we did kind of get to play it at E3.

57:25.912 --> 57:29.453
[SPEAKER_10]: This one will be the final one, though.

57:29.473 --> 57:30.053
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

57:30.133 --> 57:31.613
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let us know if there's anything different.

57:31.633 --> 57:32.213
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

57:32.233 --> 57:34.794
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anything different from what we saw at E3, then let us know.

57:35.454 --> 57:35.734
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

57:35.774 --> 57:36.794
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you back the skinny.

57:37.194 --> 57:37.514
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

57:37.574 --> 57:38.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Zach, we got to go.

57:38.255 --> 57:39.075
[SPEAKER_03]: We got more calls coming in.

57:39.455 --> 57:39.735
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

57:39.795 --> 57:40.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

57:41.415 --> 57:42.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun in your Times Square.

57:43.135 --> 57:44.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I do love Times Square, though.

57:44.476 --> 57:45.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I love New York City.

57:46.036 --> 57:48.856
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do live there and listen to this show, you're lucky, because I do love that place.

57:49.376 --> 57:50.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another phone call.

57:50.417 --> 57:51.597
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

57:51.617 --> 57:52.037
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

57:53.757 --> 57:56.218
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky, I was joking about Big Mother Truckers.

57:57.658 --> 57:58.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Bobby.

57:58.458 --> 57:59.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Kidding.

58:00.578 --> 58:00.878
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

58:00.898 --> 58:04.919
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't say things in chat like that without putting a JK or something.

58:05.019 --> 58:05.539
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

58:06.379 --> 58:07.079
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the JK.

58:07.139 --> 58:07.740
[SPEAKER_03]: It was silent.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.780
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on the internet, therefore it must be true.

58:09.800 --> 58:10.220
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

58:11.656 --> 58:12.256
[SPEAKER_03]: You got me.

58:16.177 --> 58:18.858
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that, since you got me, I will let you pimp your show.

58:18.938 --> 58:19.398
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.

58:20.078 --> 58:20.698
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my show?

58:20.858 --> 58:21.098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

58:21.318 --> 58:23.198
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my show is the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

58:23.238 --> 58:28.860
[SPEAKER_11]: We're on allgames.com, and we talked about how table tennis does actually have a whore in it.

58:29.660 --> 58:30.220
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesper.

58:30.980 --> 58:31.740
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Jesper.

58:32.500 --> 58:33.081
[SPEAKER_11]: He is a whore.

58:33.601 --> 58:36.041
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody who's played table tennis knows Jesper's a big whore.

58:36.701 --> 58:37.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he is.

58:37.862 --> 58:38.722
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to clear that up.

58:39.022 --> 58:39.562
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, no problem.

58:39.582 --> 58:40.062
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll say Bobby.

58:40.592 --> 58:43.294
[SPEAKER_09]: Allgames.com Allgames.com Allgames.com

59:08.840 --> 59:10.661
[SPEAKER_03]: Say it enough times and people will go there, Bobby.

59:11.902 --> 59:13.623
[SPEAKER_11]: Ballgames.com All right, have a good one.

59:14.163 --> 59:14.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

59:14.643 --> 59:14.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

59:16.825 --> 59:17.425
[SPEAKER_03]: We love Bobby.

59:17.465 --> 59:17.945
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so cool.

59:18.906 --> 59:19.446
[SPEAKER_03]: One more call.

59:19.486 --> 59:21.988
[SPEAKER_03]: I lied before when I said that Zaku would be last.

59:22.008 --> 59:22.768
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing one more.

59:22.808 --> 59:23.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

59:23.769 --> 59:24.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

59:24.709 --> 59:25.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Anoush.

59:25.890 --> 59:26.530
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Anoush.

59:26.590 --> 59:27.231
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

59:27.451 --> 59:29.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did butcher your name earlier, didn't I?

59:32.194 --> 59:33.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know, and knowing's half the battle.

59:33.774 --> 59:34.675
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Anoush?

59:35.515 --> 59:36.336
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick question.

59:37.329 --> 59:43.594
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys think that Sony is just going to surprise us all right at launch with all these games and things that no one was expecting?

59:46.417 --> 59:47.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, it's like the remix.

59:48.078 --> 59:48.859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's echoing there.

59:49.559 --> 59:50.200
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful, buddy.

59:50.220 --> 59:51.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn down your volume there.

59:51.340 --> 59:54.523
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so because Sony isn't very smart.

59:58.626 --> 59:59.307
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree.

59:59.327 --> 01:00:02.890
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sony has surprises left in store.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.191
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have to.

01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:05.712
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sony...

01:00:07.578 --> 01:00:10.799
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to have to do something to make up for E3.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what that is, but it will be a surprise when it's said.

01:00:16.181 --> 01:00:20.223
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that Sony is going to leave themselves in this hole that they've dug.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:33.528
[SPEAKER_03]: What they need to do is they need to gag everybody at that company, shut the F up, do not talk about PS3 anymore, stop talking to the gaming press, and then two months before the system comes out, we will have the bang-up press conference.

01:00:34.128 --> 01:00:35.149
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a do-over...

01:00:36.358 --> 01:00:37.859
[SPEAKER_03]: and do it right this time.

01:00:37.919 --> 01:00:44.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm using the internal mic for my MacBook Pro.

01:00:45.045 --> 01:00:45.605
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:48.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Anoush, any other thoughts on that that you want to share?

01:00:48.888 --> 01:00:49.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing really.

01:00:49.868 --> 01:00:50.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:54.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for the question, but I've got to hang up because the echo is driving me nuts.

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:58.035
[SPEAKER_08]: I love what Xander K. said in the chat.

01:00:58.435 --> 01:00:59.396
[SPEAKER_08]: What did Xander K. say?

01:00:59.416 --> 01:01:02.038
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of sounds like my wife's breast pump.

01:01:02.098 --> 01:01:02.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross.

01:01:03.959 --> 01:01:04.820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so nasty.

01:01:06.516 --> 01:01:07.556
[SPEAKER_03]: That was freaky.

01:01:09.057 --> 01:01:10.817
[SPEAKER_08]: Skye's voice second mix from Dark Tetsuya.

01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:12.377
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounded scary.

01:01:13.318 --> 01:01:16.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know, like I was in Poltergeist or something.

01:01:16.338 --> 01:01:17.939
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, any last minute stories?

01:01:17.959 --> 01:01:19.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Come into the light, Rob.

01:01:19.419 --> 01:01:21.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last minute stories here in studio?

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:35.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to mention, since we talked about Table Tennis, that Grand Theft Auto 4 is actually going to be using Table Tennis' graphic engine called Rage, Rockstar's advanced game engine, for Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:01:35.383 --> 01:01:36.263
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be pretty sweet.

01:01:37.529 --> 01:01:39.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, table tennis is a good-looking game.

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:41.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope it carries over into Grand Theft Auto.

01:01:41.851 --> 01:01:42.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it will.

01:01:42.572 --> 01:01:43.872
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no doubt it'll look sexy.

01:01:44.213 --> 01:01:44.573
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.

01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:46.374
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, did you have anything?

01:01:48.975 --> 01:01:53.137
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there is a list out, a very special list.

01:01:53.437 --> 01:01:53.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:01:54.638 --> 01:01:59.841
[SPEAKER_09]: This is basically the list of games that have been released since Duke Nukem Forever was announced.

01:02:01.462 --> 01:02:01.882
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

01:02:01.902 --> 01:02:01.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:02:02.656 --> 01:02:03.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Duke Nukem Forever

01:02:32.586 --> 01:03:01.612
[SPEAKER_09]: The Legend of Zelda series since Ocarina of Time a bunch of over 75 games in the Mega Man universe 12 games featuring Mega Man universe character cameos 50 games in the Star Wars universe Mario has been in 58 different games since it was announced every Thief game, every version of Counter Strike Half-Life every Tony Hawk game video game systems, the Xbox was released and all the systems since then it also lists some fun facts

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:09.080
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1997, the fastest consumer internet connection was a 33.6 KBPS modem.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.462
[SPEAKER_09]: On average, consumer internet connections were 300 times faster today.

01:03:15.722 --> 01:03:18.744
[SPEAKER_09]: When Duke Nukem Forever was announced, the fastest processor was a 233 MHz Pentium.

01:03:18.764 --> 01:03:23.525
[SPEAKER_09]: In April 1997, there was no Google and there was no eBay.

01:03:23.565 --> 01:03:24.605
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.120
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there was eBay.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:30.761
[SPEAKER_03]: There was eBay.

01:03:31.021 --> 01:03:32.822
[SPEAKER_03]: It just was not even what it was now.

01:03:33.322 --> 01:03:34.423
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was no weblog.

01:03:36.864 --> 01:03:46.408
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as disasters, it says there's been 125 hurricanes happened since then, 20 death toll-producing tornado outbreaks in the United States, and 50 major earthquakes in the world.

01:03:46.509 --> 01:03:50.370
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, it's been a long freaking time since they announced Duke Nukem.

01:03:50.531 --> 01:03:54.012
[SPEAKER_09]: Britney Spears' entire musical career as a pop star took place since the announcement.

01:03:54.553 --> 01:03:56.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody had a lot of free time on their hands.

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:57.054
[SPEAKER_09]: This is fabulous.

01:03:57.094 --> 01:03:57.494
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

01:03:59.594 --> 01:04:01.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is great.

01:04:02.196 --> 01:04:03.977
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 new members have been elected to the Senate.

01:04:05.498 --> 01:04:08.640
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill Clinton finished his presidential term and George Bush came on.

01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:12.643
[SPEAKER_09]: Four nations acquired nuclear weapons technology.

01:04:12.663 --> 01:04:14.665
[SPEAKER_09]: 19 wars have begun and five wars have ended.

01:04:16.566 --> 01:04:18.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze wants to know why this wasn't side of the week.

01:04:20.929 --> 01:04:24.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I didn't think about it, because we wanted to do Sexy Roth and we had already decided last week.

01:04:24.952 --> 01:04:25.352
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:04:26.232 --> 01:04:29.935
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm logging into eBay right now to see when I actually... It was worth a mention, most assuredly.

01:04:30.815 --> 01:04:32.096
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank whoever sent it to me.

01:04:33.377 --> 01:04:35.458
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm logging in to see when I bought something on eBay.

01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:37.360
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought something on eBay.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.421
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this, on my feedback.

01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:39.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Prompt, response, and payment.

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:40.862
[SPEAKER_03]: A pleasure to do business with.

01:04:41.403 --> 01:04:45.866
[SPEAKER_03]: April 26, 1997 was when that feedback was left on my account.

01:04:47.507 --> 01:04:48.267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old school.

01:04:49.508 --> 01:04:53.731
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feedback rating of 3, because the last time I bought something from eBay, you know when the last feedback was left? 99%.

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:57.289
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, though, I bought Super Metroid.

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, none of you care.

01:04:57.989 --> 01:04:58.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I talking about it?

01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:59.309
[SPEAKER_03]: None of you care.

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:03.631
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one more phone call because I forgot I promised this person they could be on tonight.

01:05:03.671 --> 01:05:04.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:05:04.771 --> 01:05:05.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:07.052
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know it was a promise.

01:05:07.092 --> 01:05:08.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's DMN.

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, DMN.

01:05:09.052 --> 01:05:10.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember saying something about it.

01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:10.893
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

01:05:11.973 --> 01:05:14.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I found out how to give away the Wii.

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:16.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's right.

01:05:16.835 --> 01:05:17.835
[SPEAKER_03]: You're giving away a Wii.

01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:18.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:05:18.896 --> 01:05:20.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how are you going to give away a Wii?

01:05:21.072 --> 01:05:24.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because I'm a huge fan of interactivity, just like you guys are.

01:05:24.535 --> 01:05:30.219
[SPEAKER_04]: People who come, listen live in the chatroom, and argue appropriately with your discussion get points.

01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:32.941
[SPEAKER_04]: The more points they get, the more stuff they get.

01:05:33.382 --> 01:05:38.205
[SPEAKER_04]: If they win during the week, right now, actually, Funnydale's kicking everyone's ass.

01:05:39.006 --> 01:05:40.447
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a t-shirt from Nintendo.

01:05:40.487 --> 01:05:42.168
[SPEAKER_03]: So Funnydale's not just a clever name.

01:05:42.769 --> 01:05:44.530
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:05:44.971 --> 01:05:49.314
[SPEAKER_04]: The highest average score, you gotta do at least six of these, you get a Wii.

01:05:50.712 --> 01:05:51.333
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:05:51.793 --> 01:06:01.662
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, you have this completely subjective system that you just are going to just kind of pretty much give the system to whoever you think is the funniest.

01:06:02.483 --> 01:06:03.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily the funniest.

01:06:03.764 --> 01:06:05.766
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever brings the better arguments.

01:06:05.806 --> 01:06:06.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever's the wittiest.

01:06:07.207 --> 01:06:07.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:06:07.407 --> 01:06:07.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, get it?

01:07:15.994 --> 01:07:17.715
