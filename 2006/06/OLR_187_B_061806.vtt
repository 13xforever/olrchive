Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.800 --> 00:26.800
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 187 for this June 18th, 2006.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.880
and let's get right back into the news we're going to start it off with the

00:29.880 --> 00:32.200
Loki has a story about PlayStation 3

00:32.200 --> 00:35.240
yes don't we always have a story about the PlayStation 3

00:35.240 --> 00:38.440
well it is newsworthy exactly

00:38.440 --> 00:42.720
basically now the whole thing coming out with the PlayStation 3 is

00:42.720 --> 00:46.160
what's it going to be like with retailers

00:46.160 --> 00:49.760
am I gonna be able to get one what kind of qualities can we expect

00:49.760 --> 00:53.640
well according to games first they had a

00:53.640 --> 01:02.080
internal GameStop email, which expressed concern over how many PS3s their chain, which is the

01:02.080 --> 01:07.420
largest chain out there, including eBay games, would have available.

01:07.420 --> 01:13.800
And a local store that would be receiving between 50 to 100 Xbox 360s at launch, and

01:13.800 --> 01:18.880
that wasn't very many, is expected to get no more than 20 PS3s.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.880
So if this is true, that's going to suck.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.200
Or it's not going to matter because people won't be buying them.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.000
But I know I was going to say, I don't want to be a jerk, I don't want to be the anti-Sony

01:31.000 --> 01:34.980
guy because I'm really trying to give everybody a fair shot here even if I'm being constantly

01:34.980 --> 01:39.840
disappointed over there, but is it realistic that there's going to be as many people that

01:39.840 --> 01:41.920
want the PlayStation 3 S1 and Xbox 360?

01:41.920 --> 01:47.260
That's the thing, I think there will be a lot of people wanting it, but I'm not sure.

01:47.260 --> 01:54.420
It will still be a clusterfuck like the 360 launch was, I think.

01:54.420 --> 01:59.380
I don't think that they're going to be having trouble selling those 20 units.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.660
That's why I think it's going to be a problem, though.

02:01.660 --> 02:05.300
But those 20 units are just going to end up on Craigslist, eBay, etcetera?

02:05.300 --> 02:07.300
Yeah, they will.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.780
Because people learned that they can do that.

02:10.780 --> 02:15.180
Sad, sad, sad.

02:15.180 --> 02:20.460
Any way that we can dodge this or is this just brace yourselves, get your pre-orders

02:20.460 --> 02:25.020
in ASAP as soon as they'll start taking them or have a game plan if you really want this?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.020
Pretty much, yeah.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.020
All right, heads up.

02:27.020 --> 02:30.300
Hope you learned from the Xbox 360 experience.

02:30.300 --> 02:34.220
Moving on to a completely different topic, well, it does have to do with the next generation

02:34.220 --> 02:39.260
of gaming, but it's an old game, very, very old game, making its way into the next generation

02:39.260 --> 02:40.260
of gaming.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.260
Yes, Jamie?

02:41.260 --> 02:42.940
This makes my heart happy.

02:42.940 --> 02:46.860
what one of the number one favorite games in my house is that would be

02:46.860 --> 02:53.140
Dragon's Lair okay which I have the Sega CD version I have it on an arcade

02:53.140 --> 02:58.660
emulator I have it on our two copies on DVD what is it about the game that you

02:58.660 --> 03:04.060
love so much because honestly if you just memorize the that doesn't matter

03:04.060 --> 03:07.860
it's Don Bluth animation it's just so cool and it's neat watching all the

03:07.860 --> 03:11.820
different ways he turns into a skeleton and dies and you know and on top of that

03:11.820 --> 03:14.020
It's just really fun.

03:14.020 --> 03:17.140
Digital Leisure is bringing it out in high definition

03:17.140 --> 03:18.580
for the PC.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.180
Oh, for the PC.

03:20.180 --> 03:21.720
Which means that I'm basically going

03:21.720 --> 03:25.420
to be hooking it up through my laptop to our 50-inch widescreen

03:25.420 --> 03:26.820
and playing the hell out of it.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.180
That's going to be kind of cool.

03:28.180 --> 03:30.580
So imagine how that's going to look on my TV.

03:30.580 --> 03:31.340
But wait a minute.

03:31.340 --> 03:34.220
These cartoons were made in 83 or something, right?

03:34.220 --> 03:35.820
It's still awesome.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.100
Is it really going to look that much different in HD?

03:38.100 --> 03:38.780
Or what are they going to do?

03:38.780 --> 03:40.440
Are they going to redo it or anything?

03:40.440 --> 03:43.260
they're basically taking the original

03:43.260 --> 03:46.100
footage from what I understand and redoing it for high definition.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.620
Well, that might be cool.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.300
But, imagine, you know, the first...

03:50.300 --> 03:52.660
when it first came out, it was on laserdisc.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.200
So, it was the cleanest thing out there,

03:55.200 --> 03:58.620
you know, in the eighties as far as its, you know, resolution. I mean, it was cleaner than

03:58.620 --> 04:01.300
almost anything that you'd get at your house,

04:01.300 --> 04:03.660
you know, for any type of animation. So,

04:03.660 --> 04:07.860
by that respect, you know, I'm actually pretty, pretty excited about this.

04:07.860 --> 04:11.860
and also they're going to be following up with Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.

04:11.860 --> 04:15.860
Time warp!

04:15.860 --> 04:19.860
Interesting thought there from Xander K. in our chatroom. Dragon's Lair for

04:19.860 --> 04:23.860
Xbox Live Arcade, Xander says. I don't know. It might be a little big.

04:23.860 --> 04:27.860
To do it justice, it would really be too big. You could port over the Commodore 64

04:27.860 --> 04:31.860
version, which I had. It wasn't that bad.

04:31.860 --> 04:35.860
For Commodore 64, it wasn't that bad a game. It had good music.

04:35.860 --> 04:41.540
music. They had to remove a ton of scenes out of the Sega CD version just to get it to fit.

04:41.540 --> 04:46.900
It's grainier than hell. I mean, now that's though, keep in mind, I think a CD is what,

04:46.900 --> 04:55.780
700 megabytes? How big is your average Xbox arcade game? Probably, what, 40, 50 megs?

04:55.780 --> 05:01.940
I think it's 50 megs because they have to keep it under the size of the memory card.

05:01.940 --> 05:09.300
So you've got it so a 700 meg game versus you know that's also not count

05:09.300 --> 05:13.840
you know we have to include audio with that you know I'm sure compressive

05:13.840 --> 05:17.780
compression technology is a lot better now than it was then but still think you

05:17.780 --> 05:21.540
know keep that in mind we're talking about full solid animation I doubt that

05:21.540 --> 05:27.740
it's gonna really be able to pull out well at least in and maintain proper

05:27.740 --> 05:31.880
resolution gs-191 in our chat room orange launch radio.com click on chat

05:31.880 --> 05:36.400
says sky they're going back to old 30s and 40s movies and remastering them in

05:36.400 --> 05:41.060
HD and they look damn good to boot okay I'm one of I have seen some of the old

05:41.060 --> 05:44.480
movies on the HD channels we have here and they look pretty good I mean they

05:44.480 --> 05:47.720
still look dated but I okay I'm willing to give it a fair shot don't get me

05:47.720 --> 05:53.080
wrong I do enjoy dragons lair it's it's it's a neat I just love the concept and

05:53.080 --> 05:57.240
you know it's a very unique type of game also in the next few weeks keep your eye

05:57.240 --> 06:03.240
on our stuff at stuff.orangelandradio.com, our blog, for a review.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.240
Oh, someone's getting the hookup.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.240
Someone is.

06:07.240 --> 06:13.240
Sweet. Now, also our chat room brings up, I want to say it was VX JasonXV, Dark Knight, somebody over there was talking about Space Ace.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.240
So if we get success with Dragon's Lair.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
They did Space Ace.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.240
Oh, they're going to do Space Ace HD and all that good stuff?

06:18.240 --> 06:24.240
They said it. It was actually the next one out should be Space Ace, and let me double check it once more.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.240
Yeah, that'd be kind of cool.

06:25.240 --> 06:28.440
Next out Space Ace HD and Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp.

06:28.440 --> 06:33.040
Wow. They actually had a Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp in a local arcade here

06:33.040 --> 06:37.360
not that long ago. And it was broken. Oh, that's sad. It worked at one point.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.440
I so would have bought that. Oh, you know we got another pinball.

06:40.440 --> 06:45.240
Again? We got a whodunnit. You guys are nuts.

06:45.240 --> 06:50.360
Yeah. Speaking of taking old games and making them new all over again,

06:50.360 --> 06:54.360
the Xbox 360 got a backwards compatibility update this week and

06:54.360 --> 07:00.560
I want to say 21 new games are playable, I think seven more in Japan, so you get 28 if you're Japan.

07:00.960 --> 07:07.600
But 21 new games are now playable, Amp 2, Doom 3, Fatal Frame,

07:08.140 --> 07:12.120
Silent Hill 4, Lego Star Wars, Minority Report,

07:13.480 --> 07:17.660
Spider-Man, Spawn Armageddon, Star Wars Battlefront, The Punisher,

07:18.160 --> 07:22.200
just to name a few on the list there. If you want to see the full list, head on over to Xbox.com.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.200
They've updated their backwards compatibility list

07:24.200 --> 07:28.840
I will say I did pop in my copy of Silent Hill for the room just to kind of check out see what it looked like

07:28.840 --> 07:34.120
It looked really clean like it does look better than it does on the Xbox. I don't I don't know what it is about it

07:34.120 --> 07:37.400
I don't know if the software is uprising it or something, but the game looked pretty nice

07:37.840 --> 07:44.360
It doesn't look 360 game quality, but it's definitely a little bitty baby step up from the Xbox

07:44.360 --> 07:49.640
So I was pretty impressed. I am kind of sad though that still it's not

07:49.640 --> 07:54.140
Most of my collection I still cannot play on the 360.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.140
The majority of it I still can't play.

07:56.140 --> 08:02.140
I don't know how long it'll take before we can play more of them.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.140
Do you think they're going to keep going?

08:04.140 --> 08:07.140
I heard Peter Moore took back what he had said last week and all that stuff.

08:07.140 --> 08:11.140
Do you think they're going to go back and really take an effort to make all

08:11.140 --> 08:15.140
or at least all of the top 100 best selling games playable?

08:15.140 --> 08:20.440
Or do you think this is something that slowly is going to phase out and xbox or Microsoft's just going to try and

08:20.860 --> 08:24.340
You know try to give us new stuff to make us forget about this whole

08:25.020 --> 08:26.660
kind of

08:26.660 --> 08:29.820
Mistake of not having these backwards compatibility games sooner

08:29.820 --> 08:33.660
I think it's gonna be probably just sticking with this kind of rate where there's like a

08:34.460 --> 08:36.460
few games every month I

08:37.100 --> 08:42.420
Wish I wish they would just kind of release the patch as they get new ones even if it's just four or five why not?

08:42.420 --> 08:46.420
put out the patch you know but maybe they just I don't know maybe it's too much for

08:46.420 --> 08:50.620
their servers or something something technical I'm not thinking of I don't know well I mean

08:50.620 --> 08:55.460
the update was automatic I remember that Chinese update that was the backwards compatibility

08:55.460 --> 09:01.100
as well well but that's important if you're in China but I'm not so I don't care well

09:01.100 --> 09:04.860
but I don't know I don't know maybe they have to patch them all at once I don't know who

09:04.860 --> 09:12.220
knows anyway Microsoft's making a lot of interesting statements this week yes Loki well sorta yeah

09:12.220 --> 09:15.420
Yeah, I mean, it's somebody on their development staff.

09:15.420 --> 09:22.420
But anyways, Microsoft's Matt Lee, a developer in Microsoft's Game Technology Group said,

09:22.420 --> 09:29.540
and I quote, Japan's not necessarily the most important market for gaming these days, adding,

09:29.540 --> 09:34.820
it's also not quite as large as the U.S. and European markets.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.740
That's hilarious.

09:36.740 --> 09:43.860
And I think everybody out there, well Nintendo's doing a good job of not saying anything.

09:43.860 --> 09:52.500
I think that unless you're the PR guy at Microsoft or you're the PR guy over at Sony, you should

09:52.500 --> 09:57.980
probably shut the hell up about everything because you're just digging yourself into

09:57.980 --> 09:58.980
a hole.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.840
That's a really weird thing to say.

10:00.840 --> 10:05.080
I understand that Microsoft is kind of struggling in Japan because I was looking at some sales

10:05.080 --> 10:09.600
numbers and you know even the ps2 is still well hell even here though the ps2

10:09.600 --> 10:13.560
what outsold earnings but of course the ps2 got a price cut last month to it

10:13.560 --> 10:18.640
outsold 360 earnings money it's not that important market share not that

10:18.640 --> 10:27.160
important you know stock prices not that important okay it's important is what

10:27.160 --> 10:33.940
color our consoles come in that's damn important I don't know dark soccer what

10:33.940 --> 10:40.140
What do you think about that statement, the whole Japan is not that important?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.140
That's utter crap.

10:41.140 --> 10:46.900
I mean, think about it, it's not just a big market for the fact that there are people

10:46.900 --> 10:52.780
who stand in line for new releases of games, who basically are stalkerish over voice actors

10:52.780 --> 10:57.180
for games, you know, we're importing games from there because they're better than what

10:57.180 --> 11:02.260
we have here, you know, that's just complete and utter crap to say that the market is just

11:02.260 --> 11:06.420
not as important is the fact that they are not properly catering to that market.

11:06.420 --> 11:11.080
Do you think that we might have a biased perspective being that the background on this program

11:11.080 --> 11:16.300
we've always kind of been fans kind of geared towards that Japanese import audience or kind

11:16.300 --> 11:19.500
of more of the games we play, but in the bigger picture...

11:19.500 --> 11:24.020
I'm referring over just to the social side that games have.

11:24.020 --> 11:31.980
I look at our, you know, the fanbase for a lot of these games is a lot bigger than, you

11:31.980 --> 11:36.240
know, of course it is here, because here to us it's niche, but to, you know, to a lot

11:36.240 --> 11:41.180
of the fandom groups there, I mean, there's a lot bigger crowd, I think.

11:41.180 --> 11:46.140
You know, you've got those people that are going to stand in line for, you know, a new

11:46.140 --> 11:51.500
RPG, you know, where we have the Madden crowds are just a few people at a time, pretty much.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.500
It may be a busier sales day, but you don't have people just hanging out in lines outside

11:55.500 --> 12:01.060
of stores or going to meet so-and-so voice actor who was in this game.

12:01.060 --> 12:02.980
That doesn't happen here.

12:02.980 --> 12:08.140
Games are not just the fact that there's a big market for it.

12:08.140 --> 12:14.780
It's a big social thing too, a lot bigger than it is here, and that's just in general.

12:14.780 --> 12:15.780
For us, it's niche.

12:15.780 --> 12:18.860
Over there, it's a lot bigger.

12:18.860 --> 12:21.880
Let's talk about something that's going on in Japan and other companies doing something

12:21.880 --> 12:22.880
special over there.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.920
It's Sony and Jamie you'll like this.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.100
There's a LocoRoco bundle coming out in Japan.

12:28.100 --> 12:33.240
Sony is basically going to be celebrating the release of LocoRoco by putting together

12:33.240 --> 12:39.000
a hardware bundle that will have the game and the PSP unit in either white or black.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.200
So all together that's PSP unit, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 meg card and LocoRoco.

12:45.200 --> 12:52.360
It's all packaged together in a special box and it comes out July 13th for 24,800 yen.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.920
Also has a special LocoRoco case that goes with it.

12:54.920 --> 12:55.920
Didn't I say that?

12:55.920 --> 12:57.560
I have the special Katamari case.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.560
Oh.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.920
What do you think?

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
Cool?

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
Worth importing?

13:01.920 --> 13:03.500
Well, I guess you already have a PSP so maybe not.

13:03.500 --> 13:08.560
It's cool, I mean, but honestly, I've already got a PSP.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.760
I just care about the game.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.760
That's still kind of neat though.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.720
And I already have a cool case running because Dan got me the one that came out with me and

13:14.720 --> 13:20.320
Katamari. Which I don't have. Well, for those of you guys that love to import things, maybe

13:20.320 --> 13:24.480
there will be something there. Uh, darks! Oh, yeah. Just like getting all the stuff

13:24.480 --> 13:29.660
that came with Poppin' Music 11 to get in teacups and towels. They get some crazy collector

13:29.660 --> 13:32.640
editions in Japan. Actually, what I have, I have on Dreamcast, I have the Cardcaptor

13:32.640 --> 13:39.640
Sakura game that came with a pillow case, a plate, a spoon, a fork, and um, a clock.

13:39.640 --> 13:47.600
a clock a wall clock Wow and would you actually use any of that stuff or is it

13:47.600 --> 13:51.040
just collector stuff it's collector stuff although I might put the clock up

13:51.040 --> 13:55.640
when we make my art room oh cool I love my card capture Sakura o'clock

13:55.640 --> 14:01.400
dark Sakura take us to our next story a bunch of stuff happened okay actually

14:01.400 --> 14:07.160
very descriptive thank you there was an article for the question of the week on

14:07.160 --> 14:16.100
a Gama Sutra about an interview with Chris Crawford. Basically there was he

14:16.100 --> 14:19.280
was the creator of Balance of Power. He was basically saying new ideas don't go

14:19.280 --> 14:22.040
anywhere so the industry is just rehashing the same stuff over and over

14:22.040 --> 14:25.380
again. There's nothing inherently wrong with recycling the same thing over and

14:25.380 --> 14:29.340
over and over but how do you know what you're missing if you're not trying? Has

14:29.340 --> 14:32.500
anyone noticed that we don't appeal to the general public? Well that's a quote

14:32.500 --> 14:37.240
from him so there's a new question now that's on their question of the week

14:37.240 --> 14:44.060
page and I'll get an article the link to that momentarily but it's what examples

14:44.060 --> 14:48.460
of innovation in design business or other areas do you think disprove the

14:48.460 --> 14:51.860
notion that the game industry is not evolving as quickly as it should be or

14:51.860 --> 14:56.180
is Chris Crawford right so that's actually pretty interesting I think you

14:56.180 --> 15:00.860
know being that I've always thought that innovation you know needs to happen in

15:00.860 --> 15:04.100
in games I think that we need to be seeing

15:04.100 --> 15:08.100
more that so I'm the actual article if you go on to you

15:08.100 --> 15:11.100
a gama sutures website I'm

15:11.100 --> 15:17.460
it's a well got a pretty big URL just look for the June 14 story

15:17.460 --> 15:20.780
they'll be a link to that I would actually like to see some of our people

15:20.780 --> 15:25.340
you know some of our listeners I should say you know respond to that cuz

15:25.340 --> 15:29.300
you know actually I'm actually curious myself actually you know since e-mail to

15:29.300 --> 15:35.280
Mailbag at orange on radio comm because I'd actually like to to air some of the same responses here on the show, too. I

15:36.060 --> 15:39.240
Guess we'll see two more to come then on that. Yeah all the feedback thing

15:39.240 --> 15:44.500
I think that that's a pretty good question. I'm trying to see if there's any response there in our chat room

15:44.500 --> 15:49.860
They're still all over at orange on twitter.com. Click on chat. They're still all consumed there with the card captor Sakura

15:50.420 --> 15:54.340
Pack that you have there dark. Okay, I'll put pictures of it up on our site

15:54.340 --> 15:59.020
Okay, dark Tetsuya says here's a comment relating to that dark Tetsuya says well, what's more innovative than the Wii?

16:01.860 --> 16:02.900
Interesting

16:02.900 --> 16:08.180
We just we just getting a lot of brownie points for being innovative a very innovative system

16:08.180 --> 16:12.540
I think I say you write that down send that in dark Tetsuya

16:14.020 --> 16:16.020
Moving on Loki

16:16.620 --> 16:21.260
Nintendo speaking of the Wii what's Nintendo up to well Nintendo has a new

16:21.260 --> 16:27.380
Club Nintendo, which is I guess a brand new website that they're launching that you can

16:27.380 --> 16:37.720
get a ton of really exclusive Nintendo stuff. I mean, everything they've got, for example,

16:37.720 --> 16:44.480
some different notebooks, you can get tape that have Animal Crossing characters on it.

16:44.480 --> 16:52.140
You've got these other folders that have Mario stuff on there.

16:52.140 --> 16:57.520
Some of my favorites, they have a DS case that holds 9 different styluses, all different

16:57.520 --> 17:02.180
colors of the rainbow, and 9 games that's available.

17:02.180 --> 17:07.240
Also some multicolored DS Lite cases.

17:07.240 --> 17:13.840
You've got a Mario kind of like a bookshelf for your Nintendo DS games, and then probably

17:13.840 --> 17:20.540
the best thing out of all of them on there, an exclusive Nintendo DS game, the Game & Watch

17:20.540 --> 17:25.660
Collection, where you can play Game & Watch games on your DS.

17:25.660 --> 17:26.660
Happy!

17:26.660 --> 17:30.020
Allow me to be the first to say, Game & Watch games sucked, why would I want this?

17:30.020 --> 17:31.020
Ah, Game & Watch!

17:31.020 --> 17:32.020
It's just...

17:32.020 --> 17:34.020
Outside of nostalgia value.

17:34.020 --> 17:38.300
They totally kicked the ass with Tiger Toys.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.820
I guess, I don't know.

17:39.820 --> 17:44.580
Japan only unfortunately but if you're wanting to check it out it's ah you know

17:44.580 --> 17:50.100
that shit will show up on eBay club that Nintendo jet JP slash new underscore

17:50.100 --> 17:58.860
present and there you go all right moving on to another story speaking of

17:58.860 --> 18:03.900
the Wii as well dark soccer has a story relating to the Wii yeah I sure do so

18:03.900 --> 18:08.580
who's a fan of Call of Duty 3 all five people I am it's a hugely successful

18:08.580 --> 18:14.220
game maybe not in this room yeah I love call D I'm gonna be honest never played

18:14.220 --> 18:18.940
it it's just not one out of three orange gel posts agree Call of Duty is top

18:18.940 --> 18:24.900
notch I mean it's just I'm so burned out on the war sim it's just not my enemy

18:24.900 --> 18:28.100
you should borrow mine it should but it's just not my cup fine I will borrow

18:28.100 --> 18:32.260
it and give it a champ but it's just not really my kind of game I just well we've

18:32.260 --> 18:36.560
got I got plenty other crap to play we've got details for call it I said

18:36.560 --> 18:41.560
We've got details for Call of Duty, Call of Booty, Call of Booty, there should be a new

18:41.560 --> 18:42.560
name called Call of Duty.

18:42.560 --> 18:47.280
Wow, lots of Call of Duty fans everywhere, just got offended about five times in the

18:47.280 --> 18:48.280
past 60 seconds.

18:48.280 --> 18:52.680
Listen, Call of Duty, you know if you're going to be calling in like, Duty, that was last

18:52.680 --> 18:53.680
week's show.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.680
Okay.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.680
Call of Duty.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.680
Anyway.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.680
Yes, Call of Duty 3.

18:58.680 --> 19:04.800
So there's details on the Wii version of Call of Duty 3, which I don't know how that's going

19:04.800 --> 19:12.680
work out but at any rate they're basically working on having it they

19:12.680 --> 19:17.180
actually don't have a release date scheduled for the we release but they

19:17.180 --> 19:20.520
are going to say it's going to be released this year speculation is

19:20.520 --> 19:28.240
pointing out November around Thanksgiving there hasn't been any real

19:28.240 --> 19:32.680
gameplay I think they're saying though that they're what they're working on is

19:32.680 --> 19:39.680
is actually using the Wii remote for position-pointing for that type of thing.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.680
That's pretty good. It doesn't sound like they're very far along and they're going to have that thing out at the end of the year?

19:43.680 --> 19:44.680
That's pretty aggressive.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.680
I'd say so.

19:45.680 --> 19:51.680
I'd be alarmed at that. I mean, no matter what type of game it is, if they're still kind of early on here

19:51.680 --> 19:53.680
and they're trying to get that out by the end of the year.

19:53.680 --> 20:00.680
But they're basically saying that they're going to center the reticule on the screen so that you use the controller.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.680
Huh. Innovative idea. Different, but...

20:04.680 --> 20:08.680
It sounds very similar to Red Steel.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.680
The way they move from that.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.680
Alright. Interesting.

20:16.680 --> 20:20.680
Then we shall move on, yes? Let's! Alright. Tomb Raider

20:20.680 --> 20:24.680
was going to be remade for the PSP, but then there was an announcement

20:24.680 --> 20:28.680
on Core Design's website that said it was cancelled.

20:28.680 --> 20:32.980
The video of Tomb Raider 10th Anniversary that appeared on certain sites was an unauthorized

20:32.980 --> 20:37.700
release of an internal presentation of a game that was being developed by Core Design until

20:37.700 --> 20:38.940
very recently.

20:38.940 --> 20:43.220
It was running on PSP and used Core Developed Engine, however following a recent review

20:43.220 --> 20:46.920
this project has been officially cancelled by SCI.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.020
But is Tomb Raider really cancelled?

20:49.020 --> 20:54.660
Because Eurogamer came out and said no, the remake isn't cancelled, SCI just issued a

20:54.660 --> 20:57.540
new statement saying that hey it's back on.

20:57.540 --> 21:01.140
So apparently not only are you going to be able to download Tomb Raider through this

21:01.140 --> 21:06.160
whole PSP download to Playstation 1 games thing, but now there's going to be an official

21:06.160 --> 21:08.220
remake on the PSP.

21:08.220 --> 21:13.420
Much like there was for Twisted Metal 2, I mean Twisted Metal, whatever the hell it's

21:13.420 --> 21:18.820
called, I had that game too, and very disappointing, a launch game that's actually a rehash of

21:18.820 --> 21:20.820
an old game.

21:20.820 --> 21:21.820
Hmm.

21:21.820 --> 21:22.820
Interesting.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.460
I'm kind of burned out on Tomb Raider.

21:24.460 --> 21:28.620
Tomb Raider was cool like many years ago when it was on the PC and it was like cutting edge

21:28.620 --> 21:29.620
at the time.

21:29.620 --> 21:32.380
I don't know how excited I would be about a remake.

21:32.380 --> 21:37.180
I was not a fan of the Xbox 360 one, the recent one that just came out and I got my hands

21:37.180 --> 21:39.500
on just wasn't for me.

21:39.500 --> 21:47.840
Loki, speaking of upgrades of old games, yeah, Final Fantasy VII, we've seen websites taking

21:47.840 --> 21:54.580
pre-orders for it and well Squares come out and of course said Final Fantasy 7 Remake

21:54.580 --> 22:03.920
on Playstation 3 basically that they we haven't confirmed that's in development but we have

22:03.920 --> 22:11.320
confirmed that Final Fantasy 13 is in development and so far there's no they are not working

22:11.320 --> 22:17.160
on any Final Fantasy 7 Remake will it happen probably so they didn't say no they didn't

22:17.160 --> 22:23.460
say no, they're just not working on it. They just said, we haven't said it. Yeah. And fanboys

22:23.460 --> 22:27.240
everywhere still have hope. And it's basically, we have not confirmed the Final Fantasy remake

22:27.240 --> 22:32.760
at any time. So, we haven't confirmed it, but we didn't say no. Maybe we're doing it,

22:32.760 --> 22:39.760
and maybe we're not. I'm not gonna tell you. They're doing it, okay? That's just, ugh,

22:40.940 --> 22:45.360
they're doing it. Well. That's my theory. They're doing it. If they did it, would anyone

22:45.360 --> 22:48.120
They're doing Final Fantasy everything else, why not?

22:48.120 --> 22:52.400
Tweak in our chatroom says Final Fantasy VII was good, but it's time to move on, people!

22:52.400 --> 22:54.600
I wouldn't mind it looking pretty.

22:54.600 --> 22:59.480
Jaded2006 seems to think they will move on after one more thing with the Final Fantasy

22:59.480 --> 23:00.480
VII franchise.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.200
I think it would be cool to see them remake VI.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.200
That would be cool.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.200
That would be cool.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.200
I'd like to see them go back and do IV, VI.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.320
I can find something cool.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.200
On YouTube, I found the Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy VI demo.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.280
Oh, yeah, you brought this up on a previous show before.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.280
I've been looking and looking and looking, and finally I was like, let me look on YouTube, and the whole thing's there.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.780
Because everything's on YouTube.

23:18.780 --> 23:19.780
But, um...

23:19.780 --> 23:22.280
So I'm in a video on YouTube somewhere, randomly.

23:22.280 --> 23:27.780
I honestly, though, do wish that they would remake Final Fantasy VII, not for PlayStation 3, but, you know...

23:28.780 --> 23:30.780
I mean, they're gonna if they do, but...

23:30.780 --> 23:38.280
I want them to leave it the same, except I want them to put back in the quest that was edited out on the Japanese version to bring back stupid Hobag.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.280
Even though you don't like her.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.280
Because she was freaking useful!

23:41.280 --> 23:45.280
her thing was useful the great gospel

23:45.280 --> 23:48.720
but she sucks so I wouldn't really have to use her

23:48.720 --> 23:52.240
but you just would be happy she's there yeah there was basically a whole side

23:52.240 --> 23:53.800
quest where if you use like

23:53.800 --> 23:57.600
a game basically this edited out code is what it is you can run through this quest where you

23:57.600 --> 23:58.560
pick up all the stuff

23:58.560 --> 24:02.260
then you go back into the church and you see her there and actually on the

24:02.260 --> 24:04.920
American version you see her there but when you walk forward she just disappears

24:04.920 --> 24:08.460
that's actually bad coding weird yeah

24:08.460 --> 24:10.500
The whole quest is on the Japanese one.

24:10.500 --> 24:15.340
Alright, well since we're talking about Final Fantasy VII and then we're talking about remakes

24:15.340 --> 24:19.620
that may or may not happen, that starts to make us a little angry, what better time for

24:19.620 --> 24:22.140
us to bring on the FUs of the week.

24:22.140 --> 24:25.700
It's the segment for us to get a load off our chest for a minute here about what's making

24:25.700 --> 24:27.100
us mad this week.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.540
Maybe it's the games, maybe it's not.

24:29.540 --> 24:30.540
Who cares?

24:30.540 --> 24:31.540
We're ranting.

24:31.540 --> 24:47.120
My FU of the week goes toward life forms on Interstate 5.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.100
As in all of the bug death that was all over my car that the car wash would not wash off

24:51.100 --> 24:52.980
and I had to do it by hand.

24:52.980 --> 24:58.700
And the stupid hoe bags that, I swear, and you know, and I can actually say this because

24:58.700 --> 25:06.140
I am female stupid women drivers okay this I'm getting back on the freeway

25:06.140 --> 25:12.300
after stopping at at a truck stop and I'm changing lanes that's going to get

25:12.300 --> 25:16.100
in my lane start to accelerate and this other woman and her children some type

25:16.100 --> 25:20.220
of breeder cow lady was behind a semi and it cuts me off to get in front of me

25:20.220 --> 25:25.780
and then she's like finally I just got her out of my way shot past her

25:25.780 --> 25:30.460
couldn't deal with that but like she almost clipped the front of my car and

25:30.460 --> 25:36.540
then another stupid lady on the way home in an SUV ha ha ha decides that she's

25:36.540 --> 25:41.060
gonna cut me no she's gonna tailgate me for 10 minutes and I mean literally I

25:41.060 --> 25:46.060
even put on my brakes you know almost bumped me it was crazy and then she just

25:46.060 --> 25:49.080
shoots past me so finally I said you know screw it nobody else is on the road

25:49.080 --> 25:54.060
I got in front of her and speed matched a semi she turned on her brights now

25:54.060 --> 25:59.300
keep in mind she's in an SUV I drive a Lancer I am under her lights and I'm

25:59.300 --> 26:04.320
short I didn't care plus I have tinted windows do you think that her bright

26:04.320 --> 26:09.160
lights are really gonna mean a damn thing to me you're a bitch I timed it

26:09.160 --> 26:14.680
for exactly 20 minutes I speed matched a semi and then I drove up Wow and then

26:14.680 --> 26:19.500
she tried to pass me and then I caught up with her again and speed matched

26:19.500 --> 26:25.200
another semi for 10 minutes and then kept going there's a special place in

26:25.200 --> 26:30.400
hell for people like you I'm sorry you don't tailgate people on the freeway

26:30.400 --> 26:34.480
first of all it's dangerous oh and you know what she was also in her cell phone

26:34.480 --> 26:40.080
she was on her damn cell phone three things I hate is stupid drivers people

26:40.080 --> 26:43.120
driving a TV stupidly and talking on your goddamn cell phone while you're

26:43.120 --> 26:48.660
driving no there is a special place in hell for people like her and you're

26:48.660 --> 26:53.180
right it's where they have these 20 cell phones around them and none of them work

26:53.180 --> 27:00.980
but they're all rings and they're all ringing with the singular ringtone yeah

27:00.980 --> 27:07.480
so I was like so mad and keep in mind I this is at this time I had been on the

27:07.480 --> 27:11.060
road for 10 hours to give this a background of this a friend of mine was

27:11.060 --> 27:15.860
in San Diego for convention got really sick so we drove down to meet her in

27:15.860 --> 27:20.660
Baker's field and then drove back which is like a five-hour drive from here and

27:20.660 --> 27:25.460
then I had to drive back so it was just really and I just was driving back by

27:25.460 --> 27:29.300
myself at this point I was so worn out and pissed off at the world that I was

27:29.300 --> 27:32.900
like you know what I'm going to take out all of my road frustrations and I did it

27:32.900 --> 27:39.700
in a completely safe way I did not do it by speeding tailgating or in other ways

27:39.700 --> 27:46.700
is driving unsafely, I just drove slowly, speed matching a semi. Alright, I got my revenge,

27:49.180 --> 27:56.020
power to me! We gotta keep it moving. Uh, Loki, I don't know how I can really follow

27:56.020 --> 28:01.340
that. I know. She touched all the key points about women drivers. I however am an excellent

28:01.340 --> 28:07.840
driver. Yes, because you know pacing cars and you know getting revenge against drivers

28:07.840 --> 28:14.840
I was driving safely. I didn't speed, she just couldn't get around me. She was speeding,

28:16.600 --> 28:23.040
she was doing 100. I was saving everybody else. Alright kids, stop fighting. Anyways,

28:23.040 --> 28:26.680
I don't really have an FQ of the week, but I'd like to point out an observation. I went

28:26.680 --> 28:31.980
to the drag races this weekend. My god, a lot of rednecks like drag racing. I mean I

28:31.980 --> 28:36.540
swear to god about half the people there didn't have shirts on, had tattoos, and drank in

28:36.540 --> 28:42.620
their beer with their kids, but you know what though? Jet cars are awesome, and that makes

28:42.620 --> 28:47.660
it worth it. It appeals to the redneck in me, just watching a car go 260 miles an hour

28:47.660 --> 28:56.940
down a quarter mile. My FU of the week goes to Light Rail and some of the people that

28:56.940 --> 29:01.460
ride it. I had jury duty this week, which I had for like the past two and a half weeks,

29:01.460 --> 29:06.100
which finally ended this week, thank you, it's over. It's an important civic duty though,

29:06.100 --> 29:11.180
You know, if you're in America, if it's not going to disrupt your schedule, you're not

29:11.180 --> 29:16.020
in school or whatever, and your work will compensate for you being there, I say go.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.060
It's a really great educational experience.

29:18.060 --> 29:23.260
But don't ride the light rail to the courthouse because there are some just rude people that

29:23.260 --> 29:24.260
ride it.

29:24.260 --> 29:25.260
Oh my gosh.

29:25.260 --> 29:26.260
And silly people.

29:26.260 --> 29:27.980
Yeah, all of it.

29:27.980 --> 29:28.980
All of it.

29:28.980 --> 29:29.980
So F you the light rail.

29:29.980 --> 29:31.380
Actually, if I may, Rob, do you have an addendum?

29:31.380 --> 29:32.380
Sure.

29:32.380 --> 29:35.340
I did actually speed up when I saw somebody else's lights behind her.

29:35.340 --> 29:39.340
Alright.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.340
Is chat room giving you a little crap for your story, DarkSakura?

29:41.340 --> 29:42.340
I don't know.

29:42.340 --> 29:43.340
I saw some folks cheering you on.

29:43.340 --> 29:44.340
No, I'm actually getting kudos so far.

29:44.340 --> 29:46.340
Yeah, I saw some folks cheering you on there.

29:46.340 --> 29:47.340
Alright, uh...

29:47.340 --> 29:50.340
I just want to say I was only punishing her and nobody else.

29:50.340 --> 29:51.340
Alright.

29:51.340 --> 29:57.340
Loki, we had a story on backwards compatibility earlier and you have somewhat of a footnote

29:57.340 --> 29:58.340
to that story.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.340
Yes.

29:59.340 --> 30:04.620
A certain someone named Tim Schafer is a little pissed off that his game Psychonauts isn't

30:04.620 --> 30:11.080
backwards compatible on the 360, and he's basically offered up the fly down his team

30:11.080 --> 30:19.680
to help it make it happen, but Microsoft assured him, as well as everybody else, that they're

30:19.680 --> 30:20.680
on top of it.

30:20.680 --> 30:27.440
They've got their top men on the job, so he's not too happy about that, as well as fans

30:27.440 --> 30:33.660
of Psychonauts, and will you be seeing Psychonauts on the 360 anytime soon?

30:33.660 --> 30:37.060
but probably not

30:37.060 --> 30:41.020
maybe in the next update which at the going rate will be in about four months

30:41.020 --> 30:43.140
about maybe

30:43.140 --> 30:47.060
uh... as long as they get crusty demons to work on there because that looks funny

30:47.060 --> 30:48.280
ooh that and be

30:48.280 --> 30:51.380
wait BMX triple x was censored on uh...

30:51.380 --> 30:55.220
the xbox I have no idea what system do we do we play it on because you used to have it

30:55.220 --> 30:56.540
I had it on the gamecube

30:56.540 --> 31:00.940
that's kind of a weird system to that my sister and her um... boyfriend are borrowing it

31:00.940 --> 31:02.940
Indefinite fun fun ah

31:03.580 --> 31:08.620
Dark Sakura there was a movie at the box office or a movie that did pretty well the box office this week

31:08.620 --> 31:14.660
And maybe it'll be a game now. You know what um and actually I haven't been to see it

31:14.660 --> 31:16.740
I really want to you, but nacho libre

31:17.580 --> 31:20.020
Has been licensed by Majesco

31:21.340 --> 31:23.340
What is Majesco done lately?

31:25.100 --> 31:27.060
I'm not sure

31:27.060 --> 31:31.100
To be honest, maybe their Wikipedia would clue us into that. I'm assuming

31:31.100 --> 31:38.540
It has all this useless stuff on it. Well, they're basically the game's gonna be done by bud cat creations. They brought out

31:39.660 --> 31:42.540
psychonauts and Madden NFL 2006

31:43.940 --> 31:48.580
But this is gonna be from what I'm saying, it's gonna be on the Nintendo DS

31:49.580 --> 31:53.900
It's going to be the first Nintendo DS games on the US and European market

31:53.900 --> 32:00.260
so we will have natural debris and there's also a mention that they're

32:00.260 --> 32:05.100
trying to obtain the right to the ghostwriter movie but I think take 2 got

32:05.100 --> 32:09.580
it instead you know speaking of I played that ghostwriter game at e3 and it's

32:09.580 --> 32:12.780
god-awful they should have given it to somebody else I'm sorry it was awful

32:12.780 --> 32:17.860
speaking of games and movies I completely forgot Silent Hill the movie

32:17.860 --> 32:23.020
is actually coming to DVD August 22nd in the United States so look forward to

32:23.020 --> 32:30.020
that. They're gonna have some DVD commentaries on there, plus the origins of Silent Hill

32:30.020 --> 32:35.660
and some other stuff. No UFO ending! It better have a UFO ending as an easter egg, or the

32:35.660 --> 32:41.700
dog. I want a UFO ending on it. Well, want all you want, it's not gonna happen. You don't

32:41.700 --> 32:46.420
know that. It's just like wanting the Battle Royale US movie to be good. It could be an

32:46.420 --> 32:52.540
easter egg. Oh, hello, how could we forget Majesco Guilty Gear. Yeah, that was it. I

32:52.540 --> 32:53.540
They did something I like.

32:53.540 --> 32:57.540
The Jaws game was recent too.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.540
I love Guilty Gear.

32:58.540 --> 33:03.540
Infected was also a big push from them not that long ago.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.540
I need to go see Nacho Libre though.

33:05.540 --> 33:07.540
I'll pass.

33:07.540 --> 33:10.540
I am a big fan of Mexican wrestling.

33:10.540 --> 33:13.540
Yes, but are you a big fan of Jack Black?

33:13.540 --> 33:16.540
Not too much, but I still think this is going to be hilarious.

33:16.540 --> 33:19.540
I was when he was in Tenacious D. Do they even still do stuff now?

33:19.540 --> 33:20.540
I don't know.

33:20.540 --> 33:21.540
They're making a Tenacious D movie.

33:21.540 --> 33:30.220
We've had a lot of politically oriented stories in the first half of the show and this kind

33:30.220 --> 33:39.380
of follows that the ESRB is now threatening $1 million game rating fines.

33:39.380 --> 33:46.040
The ESRB is raising this maximum penalty for a publisher who fails to disclose objectional

33:46.040 --> 33:52.520
content so don't leave your nudity on the disc because some hacker might find it and

33:52.520 --> 33:54.800
your company is going to get sued for one million.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.640
Here's my question though, I know how they have their rating system and stuff.

33:58.640 --> 34:08.160
Now I for fact know that anime, like ADV for example, they do not have ratings that are

34:08.160 --> 34:09.400
done by the MPAA.

34:09.400 --> 34:14.160
They have their own ratings that they put on there that are completely independent and

34:14.160 --> 34:19.240
And yet they are sold in stores out there that are not banning them.

34:19.240 --> 34:21.760
Who gives a crap if they get sued a million dollars?

34:21.760 --> 34:26.120
Couldn't they self-rate their games and still be able to put them out in the stores?

34:26.120 --> 34:29.480
Well, how I was going to get to that is that the ESRB, you might be asking, well what happens

34:29.480 --> 34:31.040
if they don't pay the one million dollars?

34:31.040 --> 34:36.120
What the ESRB can do is revoke the rating services and that will screw you when it comes

34:36.120 --> 34:40.160
to getting into Walmart and GameStop and all that stuff, which doesn't carry games and

34:40.160 --> 34:43.280
aren't branded.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.600
or have the AO rating, I should point out.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.920
I don't know, you raise a good point, but at the same time, with the video games getting

34:48.920 --> 34:54.680
all this negative publicity in the sense of these laws, I don't know if a video game company

34:54.680 --> 34:58.080
would be able to get away with it the same way a movie company can.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
I don't see...

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
I mean, because they're rated...

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
I don't...

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
Anime is kind of its own...

35:02.080 --> 35:05.160
I mean, in the sense that movies is kind of its own specialty world anyway.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.160
Yeah, but the ESRB...

35:06.160 --> 35:07.160
Maybe that's how they get away with it.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.520
The ESRB is like kind of an independent company anyways.

35:09.520 --> 35:15.660
Why do they have to be the one out there that says what the game is rated?

35:15.660 --> 35:18.100
Couldn't there be another rating system out there?

35:18.100 --> 35:20.700
Does it really need to be this one company?

35:20.700 --> 35:24.760
If you think about it, they're putting these companies through a lot of stupid shit.

35:24.760 --> 35:29.100
The whole hot coffee thing was ridiculous to begin with, and the fact that they're threatening

35:29.100 --> 35:31.740
$1,000,000 fines, $1,000,000 for what?

35:31.740 --> 35:35.560
Oh, that's going to teach them to not go with you?

35:35.560 --> 35:36.560
Big deal.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.560
It's an independent company.

35:37.560 --> 35:42.480
don't see what the big deal is, just self rate your games. That's what we did before

35:42.480 --> 35:47.140
we even had these ESRB things, is they either didn't have a rating or they were self rated,

35:47.140 --> 35:56.140
so big deal, I don't know. Alright, uh, Loki, take us to our next story. Speaking of craziness,

35:56.140 --> 36:02.480
I swear to god it should be a segment on this show, what crazy thing did Sony say this week?

36:02.480 --> 36:12.000
Well uh, Kutaragi, he came out and said, as the Playstation 3 is a computer we might even

36:12.000 --> 36:18.880
offer it on a build to order basis, customized to the needs of each and every user.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.360
Congratulations, you are retarded.

36:21.360 --> 36:27.120
So like a gateway Playstation 3 or a Dell PS3?

36:27.120 --> 36:28.120
So it's like a PC.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.120
So it's a PC.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.120
Dude, you're getting a PS3.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.440
Great, it's a PC.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.880
Wonderful.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.680
Sony seems to really be working that it's a computer angle.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.560
All that to avoid taxes in the UK.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.360
I don't know.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.520
They don't get it.

36:44.520 --> 36:47.680
Speaking of people in power at companies, did you hear this?

36:47.680 --> 36:52.520
This doesn't maybe directly affect gaming, but it is important to note, nerds everywhere

36:52.520 --> 36:57.400
were noting that Bill Gates has announced that he's stepping down from his head position

36:57.400 --> 36:59.800
at Microsoft in 2008.

36:59.800 --> 37:04.280
And what's going to happen after July of 2008, Gates will kind of function only in like an

37:04.280 --> 37:05.860
advisory role.

37:05.860 --> 37:07.800
He's not going to really be doing the day-to-day functions.

37:07.800 --> 37:12.880
He wants to focus on the charity stuff, which is cool, and it's got him a lot of notoriety

37:12.880 --> 37:13.880
in recent years.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.480
Wasn't he a papal of the year?

37:16.480 --> 37:19.920
Was it last year, the year before, with his wife and Bono for their charity work?

37:19.920 --> 37:23.000
I'm surprised he's being able to retire in two years.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.480
Isn't he going to go broke tomorrow?

37:25.480 --> 37:30.520
I somehow doubt that, with all the billions of dollars that he is making, he is going

37:30.520 --> 37:37.520
to be really struggling, he might have to cut back.

37:37.520 --> 37:42.080
Expect to see Ray Ozzie, who is the Chief Technical Officer, start to take on a bigger

37:42.080 --> 37:46.640
role there, not saying he is necessarily going to be a replacement, but he is going to assume

37:46.640 --> 37:51.480
the title of Chief Software Architect and work side by side with Gates on technical

37:51.480 --> 37:55.700
architecture and product oversight responsibilities.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.480
You might start seeing some of those other folks there at Microsoft starting to fill

37:58.480 --> 38:01.860
the shoes of Bill Gates.

38:01.860 --> 38:06.920
One person whose shoes cannot be filled is the great and terrible Dark Sakura.

38:06.920 --> 38:11.220
You can email her or you can email the show really, but she reads them.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.220
It's no secret.

38:12.220 --> 38:15.560
Dark Sakura is the one that's going through the mailbag there.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.520
It's mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.560
It's a way for you to interact with our program when you can't be here live on Sunday nights.

38:20.560 --> 38:25.620
when we tape, and DarkSakura reads the emails, she goes through them, puts on her hazmat

38:25.620 --> 38:30.900
suit and her rubber gloves, and pulls out some Anthrax free letters to read for you

38:30.900 --> 38:31.900
all.

38:31.900 --> 38:34.420
DarkSakura, who is emailing us this week?

38:34.420 --> 38:40.540
Well tonight I actually just have three emails.

38:40.540 --> 38:44.600
Yeah because I got one that wasn't really a particularly appropriate question and then

38:44.600 --> 38:46.760
a few others were just site suggestions.

38:46.760 --> 38:50.280
By the way, thank you to our friend Rob with Two Bees.

38:50.280 --> 38:57.040
So we have, our first email comes from Matt in the UK, he's really awesome.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.720
I just want to say that your show is awesome.

38:58.720 --> 39:02.760
I just wish that I lived in a different time zone so I can listen to your shows live.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.480
I listen to your podcasts all the time.

39:04.480 --> 39:08.520
I always learn something new when I listen to OLR and you guys always make me laugh.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.520
Thank you.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.860
I wonder if you've ever thought of coming down to the UK sometime.

39:12.860 --> 39:15.080
There's the odd convention going on here and there.

39:15.080 --> 39:19.520
If you do come down here sometime, it would make me the happiest pretty on the isle.

39:19.520 --> 39:22.880
Your show is amazing and I hope you carry on for many years to come.

39:22.880 --> 39:23.880
I would love to.

39:23.880 --> 39:28.360
In fact, I was planning on going next year.

39:28.360 --> 39:35.040
Finances are not what I thought they would be, but who knows, it could happen if we start

39:35.040 --> 39:36.040
saving our dog.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.200
Anyone buys a plane ticket, we'll go.

39:38.200 --> 39:41.600
No, I appreciate the ego inflation email.

39:41.600 --> 39:46.960
That's always nice to get, but the reality is hundreds of dollars to come over there

39:46.960 --> 39:51.040
Most of the time for it like when I did the East Coast con that came out of my own pocket

39:51.600 --> 39:55.160
If we do sakura con next year, which I'm understanding we've already been

39:55.720 --> 39:59.200
Approved guests or whatever. We're gonna have to pay for that to go there. So

40:00.080 --> 40:02.480
driving our way to if you want to

40:02.840 --> 40:08.920
If you want to help us out with play money sure will come I'd love to check out the UK

40:08.920 --> 40:11.720
I've always wanted to send orange lounge to Britain

40:12.600 --> 40:14.600
We'll see. We'll see so

40:14.600 --> 40:18.800
someday don't count it out I mean I still want to go there to travel so I

40:18.800 --> 40:22.660
will pay for it someday it's just hopefully Orange Launch Radio is still

40:22.660 --> 40:26.400
around next year and years well I know it will be but you know in when I can

40:26.400 --> 40:33.920
afford it well I got it actually an an non-story email from Rob says this is

40:33.920 --> 40:37.440
just an idea I had but if pin name and we use the we type control scheme

40:37.440 --> 40:41.320
realistic nudges could be modeled for the first time on a home game in those

40:41.320 --> 40:44.560
virtual tables that you talked about last week of course nothing comes

40:44.560 --> 40:47.040
close to a full thrust nudge on a table with no tilt.

40:47.040 --> 40:51.460
Well I don't think it's gotta be pin maim, I think any pinball simulator on the Wii could

40:51.460 --> 40:55.140
incorporate that idea, that's a dang good idea.

40:55.140 --> 41:03.140
And then we also have one from, I think in another map, said I just wanted to let you

41:03.140 --> 41:14.140
know, let you guys know that on www.ableelectronics.com they have the PS3 available for pre-order.

41:14.140 --> 41:17.600
order the only thing is that you can't really pre-order it instead of the add

41:17.600 --> 41:21.060
to cart button it is replaced with an authorized button which takes you to

41:21.060 --> 41:24.260
nowhere you should check it out go to the website and click on video game

41:24.260 --> 41:28.700
consoles under video games tab I'm sorry buddy but I've never heard of that site

41:28.700 --> 41:32.220
and I would never buy a system from a site I've never dropped $600 on the site

41:32.220 --> 41:36.900
I never heard of but you give a good chance for us to bring up this

41:36.900 --> 41:42.540
opportunity to say don't buy from places that don't know you don't have a trust

41:42.540 --> 41:47.620
Again, I don't know this company, so I'm not trying to knock it, but you know, I've never

41:47.620 --> 41:48.620
heard of it.

41:48.620 --> 41:49.620
Well, that's why I was thinking of this email.

41:49.620 --> 41:53.820
Whenever you get anything like that, your best friend for any internet ordering place

41:53.820 --> 41:58.200
is the Better Business Bureau website.

41:58.200 --> 42:02.980
Check anything out before you order online, read their feedback, or you could really be

42:02.980 --> 42:07.620
burned and just make sure that you do your research before you go through any of those

42:07.620 --> 42:08.620
websites.

42:08.620 --> 42:09.620
That's why I wanted to bring that email up.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.720
Although it is funny that they're taking pre-orders that go to nowhere.

42:12.720 --> 42:18.720
Maybe it's just something they want to make and it's broken, or I don't know, it's coming soon, who knows?

42:18.720 --> 42:23.820
Could be, under construction. Nobody in chat room is saying anything about that site, so I don't know, we'll see.

42:23.820 --> 42:26.820
Is that it? That'd be all.

42:26.820 --> 42:31.080
Alright, send us more email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

42:31.080 --> 42:34.820
Loki, meanwhile, you want to be a beta tester?

42:34.820 --> 42:39.420
Yes, if you do, then you better head on over to

42:39.420 --> 42:47.220
Atari's website, actually they're doing a online beta test for the Playstation 2 version

42:47.220 --> 42:49.780
of their new Test Drive Unlimited.

42:49.780 --> 42:58.300
And you can go and sign up right now at www.atari.com slash TDU beta test.

42:58.300 --> 43:02.260
And you can basically sign up there, of course they're saying that you're going to be under

43:02.260 --> 43:08.460
a strict non-disclosure agreement or NDA and standard.

43:08.460 --> 43:13.400
You will need to have a PlayStation 2 console, including a broadband internet connection

43:13.400 --> 43:16.060
and network adapter.

43:16.060 --> 43:21.180
Alright, so make sure to check that out.

43:21.180 --> 43:26.580
I will say though, if I am picked, I will not bite by that indie.

43:26.580 --> 43:31.140
They'll sue your ass, careful, I don't know if I'd be admitting to that.

43:31.140 --> 43:37.340
Moving on, our Skyplane is going to be opened up very soon over at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

43:37.340 --> 43:42.700
on interact with us, it's username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can call us on the telephone

43:42.700 --> 43:48.300
as well, 916-226-9067, please, please, pretty please though, if you're going to call us

43:48.300 --> 43:54.900
on Skype, please give these guys a call first, ECHO123, and you don't have to add them to

43:54.900 --> 43:57.480
their friends list, a lot of people told me, well I tried calling you but they wouldn't

43:57.480 --> 44:00.840
accept my friend invite, they're not going to, it's a computer, you just put that in

44:00.840 --> 44:05.160
as your call and it'll pick up right away and you can hear what you sound like, so please

44:05.160 --> 44:09.240
Please give them a call first, make sure you sound good, then give us a call, otherwise

44:09.240 --> 44:11.240
we get angry.

44:11.240 --> 44:17.560
That will be right after this story about the DS Lights on Japanese airline JAL.

44:17.560 --> 44:22.680
They're going to be offering their first class and executive class passengers DS Lights to

44:22.680 --> 44:25.100
play during the flight's duration.

44:25.100 --> 44:30.160
It's a special promotion that's going on until August 31st, and if you think you have to

44:30.160 --> 44:32.160
be in Japan to use this, no.

44:32.160 --> 44:36.980
But actually, the routes would include Tokyo, New York City, Tokyo, Chicago, Tokyo, LA,

44:36.980 --> 44:44.740
Tokyo, San Francisco, Tokyo, London, Tokyo, Beijing, and one other one, Tokyo, Guangzhou.

44:44.740 --> 44:47.200
If I horribly butchered that, I'm sorry.

44:47.200 --> 44:51.960
But so if you have JAL going to Tokyo from where you are, chances are you have a chance

44:51.960 --> 44:53.400
to do this.

44:53.400 --> 44:57.900
Of course, the DS Lite's Wi-Fi capabilities have been taken out because you're not supposed

44:57.900 --> 45:01.620
to have wireless and all that stuff interfering on the planes.

45:01.620 --> 45:06.900
However, you will get a chance to do a Japanese brain training game, an English brain training

45:06.900 --> 45:11.700
game, Otona no DS Golf, and Mario Kart.

45:11.700 --> 45:19.000
So no snaking on a plane?

45:19.000 --> 45:24.280
You know what, that's got to be one of the worst jokes ever told on this show, congratulations.

45:24.280 --> 45:28.660
I'm full of them, I'll keep them coming, I've been borrowing from 23 Megas.

45:28.660 --> 45:35.440

45:54.660 --> 45:56.660
Radio who's this?

45:57.260 --> 45:59.260
Hi Ravens dolphin, what's on your mind buddy?

45:59.860 --> 46:03.620
DS light again. Ah, what's up with the DS light? What are your thoughts on that?

46:04.140 --> 46:08.300
Well, a thousand of them got stolen in Hong Kong. I heard about this

46:08.300 --> 46:13.580
It's all luminous his fault because it told us how to taught us how to move crates. Remember? Yeah, they sure did

46:14.500 --> 46:16.820
What do you what do you think about that? I mean is that I

46:16.820 --> 46:20.580
I think it's crazy. You think it's crazy?

46:20.580 --> 46:24.380
Why? Because somebody was able to get away with it? Stealing all that? Yeah.

46:24.380 --> 46:29.540
Well don't you watch 24? Someone like Jack Bauer can do anything.

46:29.540 --> 46:32.980
Yeah you're right but he's dead. He's not dead.

46:32.980 --> 46:37.380
If he died the show wouldn't continue. Well one of the geeks died and that made me sad.

46:37.380 --> 46:41.000
Alright anyway this is about games. Anything else you want to say about DS Lite?

46:41.000 --> 46:44.500
No but I have a question for you. I'm sorry?

46:44.500 --> 46:50.180
I have a question for you. Oh, what? Me? Oh, what? What is the longest loading screen

46:50.180 --> 46:50.800
you ever

46:50.800 --> 46:54.140
encountered in a game?

46:54.140 --> 46:59.060
Of recent memory, Final Fantasy 11. We timed it. It takes one minute 59 seconds

46:59.060 --> 47:00.020
to get from boot up

47:00.020 --> 47:03.580
into the actual game. And that may not sound like a long time, but it is.

47:03.580 --> 47:07.420
UltraMix 3 also had a pretty horrible load time. It takes like a minute

47:07.420 --> 47:10.940
to get in there after the title screen. It's pretty bad. Any of the KOF games on

47:10.940 --> 47:11.500
Saturn?

47:11.500 --> 47:15.600
mm-hmm I Grand Theft Auto's got a pretty bad one oblivion does too but I can

47:15.600 --> 47:18.340
understand an oblivion's case because once you get in there it's pretty good

47:18.340 --> 47:22.800
actually Street Fighter alpha on the Super Nintendo had loading time mm-hmm

47:22.800 --> 47:27.000
really yes it did it was horrible you'd go to this it should like the scene and

47:27.000 --> 47:30.600
then character would pop up after like 30 minutes and then not 30 minutes 30

47:30.600 --> 47:34.240
seconds then another character would pop up and then the voice would load in and

47:34.240 --> 47:37.320
then it would start our chat rooms taking an opportunity one more thing oh

47:37.320 --> 47:42.140
Oh sure. I have a custom-built Super Nintendo controller

47:42.140 --> 47:46.400
that is custom made for a computer. Where'd you get this? Is this something you did

47:46.400 --> 47:48.760
yourself? I ordered it.

47:48.760 --> 47:52.120
Huh? I ordered it online on eBay.

47:52.120 --> 47:55.720
Oh. How's it work? Great. Works perfectly.

47:55.720 --> 48:00.880
Is it just using a bunch of different converters? No, it's a Super Nintendo controller

48:00.880 --> 48:04.680
that is USB interface and it works great with all emulators.

48:04.680 --> 48:06.280
and you got this on ebay

48:06.280 --> 48:08.180
on ebay do you remember the seller's name

48:08.180 --> 48:09.440
so you can recommend it

48:09.440 --> 48:11.040
no i don't know that

48:11.040 --> 48:16.160
the the website this guy makes all of them he even made a power glove

48:16.160 --> 48:19.280
computer one wow well do you remember though um...

48:19.280 --> 48:22.200
the people who made the uh...

48:22.200 --> 48:25.620
uh... pc out of the nintendo

48:25.620 --> 48:28.720
i remember someone did an atari one

48:28.720 --> 48:32.440
well they actually the site's gone now but he was actually building them

48:32.440 --> 48:38.360
for people in selling and he was making the controller into a USB and also converting

48:38.360 --> 48:41.800
the Super Nintendo mouse into a PC mouse.

48:41.800 --> 48:46.720
Oh yeah, they do have that on, I did see that, the mouse one, I want to buy it, it was like

48:46.720 --> 48:47.720
24 bucks.

48:47.720 --> 48:53.040
But he was building it basically out of laptop parts and just putting a USB connector instead

48:53.040 --> 48:57.320
of the regular plug-in and setting up drivers for it.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.320
Oh, sounds interesting.

48:59.320 --> 49:02.280
Ravenstaufen, I want to point out as well, the chat room is giving quite a response to

49:02.280 --> 49:05.840
your question about load times i hit stun saying half-life 2 takes me

49:05.840 --> 49:11.040
forever to load you will bow to me says midnight club dub for PSP has hella load

49:11.040 --> 49:11.900
times

49:11.900 --> 49:18.660
yeah i agree xander k says the sims 2 for PSP has the crappiest loads ever

49:18.660 --> 49:23.200
wow i didn't expect such a response to this well it was just a random question

49:23.200 --> 49:26.520
see how easy it is to get a response out of people just get on a microphone and

49:26.520 --> 49:28.360
start yelling

49:28.360 --> 49:31.400
alright i know you got a bunch of calls so i'm gonna let it go yeah we got a couple

49:31.400 --> 49:32.400
All right.

49:32.400 --> 49:33.400
Have a good one, Ravenstaufen.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.400
Thanks for the call.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.400
Bye.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.400
Later.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.400
Let's go to another call.

49:37.400 --> 49:38.400
Hi.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.400
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.400
Who's this?

49:40.400 --> 49:41.400
It's Diginova.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.400
Hi, Diginova.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.400
Hey.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.400
How you doing?

49:44.400 --> 49:45.840
Just letting you know it's sunrise here at the moment.

49:45.840 --> 49:46.840
Oh, my God.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.640
What time is it over there?

49:48.640 --> 49:49.840
It's 4.30 in the morning.

49:49.840 --> 49:52.680
I can tell where you're from from the sound of your voice.

49:52.680 --> 49:53.680
That's wow.

49:53.680 --> 49:54.680
He's so tired.

49:54.680 --> 49:59.440
Well, I was going to go to bed at midnight, but I asked my fiancé, could I please just

49:59.440 --> 50:02.960
stay up and listen to you guys because I've got the time off because I've just changed jobs.

50:02.960 --> 50:08.320
Oh, thank you fiance for us. And thank you for being so dedicated. You're crazy. I love it.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.080
What's on your mind? What do you want to share with listeners?

50:10.960 --> 50:12.480
It was actually two points. First of all,

50:12.480 --> 50:14.960
make it quick because I know you guys got other people calling. It was,

50:15.840 --> 50:21.200
I was watching the TV show called Gamer TV. It's here in Bravo. It's a Sky

50:21.200 --> 50:24.720
thing, Rupert Murdoch thing anyway. I want to say we get that over here. Don't,

50:24.720 --> 50:27.200
didn't they used to show that on a G4 at some point?

50:27.200 --> 50:30.400
gamer TV yeah I'm a different network though but

50:30.400 --> 50:34.000
yeah okay with one of the show anyway I'm sorry go ahead yeah

50:34.000 --> 50:37.280
what basically it's been backing up what you say about games and

50:37.280 --> 50:40.480
parents and the rest but this one in particular was about a doctor in

50:40.480 --> 50:44.320
Chicago saying games are very good and how they influence the

50:44.320 --> 50:48.240
mind and how the keyhole surgery it was I forgot

50:48.240 --> 50:51.520
what he said it was it's a on there but it was really

50:51.520 --> 50:54.480
interesting to the point of you saying like how games were influencing

50:54.480 --> 50:57.700
I just thought I would bring that up and the second point was when the hell are they going

50:57.700 --> 50:59.940
to release Outrun for the backwards compatibility?

50:59.940 --> 51:02.820
That was one reason why I kept my game.

51:02.820 --> 51:08.020
You know, it's why I hate that guy.

51:08.020 --> 51:11.700
First off, to address the first point about the Chicago guy, I want to say this sounds

51:11.700 --> 51:15.580
very similar to a story we had a while back.

51:15.580 --> 51:18.700
It was a little while ago and I don't know if it's the same one or different or what,

51:18.700 --> 51:23.060
but it seems like once in a while you do get these doctors who come out and say, you know

51:23.060 --> 51:32.620
know what, this really does help reaction times, hand eye coordination is the old fall

51:32.620 --> 51:33.620
back.

51:33.620 --> 51:37.020
I actually read a test in a psychological journal that was talking about reaction times

51:37.020 --> 51:42.180
especially when playing puzzle games, RPGs, versus non-gamers and that the gamer group

51:42.180 --> 51:44.140
came out way ahead.

51:44.140 --> 51:47.460
It's too bad our politicians don't seem to be counting any of that.

51:47.460 --> 51:54.980
There is nothing over here in the same politics way going towards gaming.

51:54.980 --> 51:56.500
How is it over there?

51:56.500 --> 52:01.380
While I've got a UK listener on the phone, I can kind of ask what is the impression over

52:01.380 --> 52:05.580
there of what is going on over here with the gaming laws?

52:05.580 --> 52:09.980
Is it we're a bunch of crazies over here in America or is it the same things happening

52:09.980 --> 52:10.980
over here?

52:10.980 --> 52:11.980
There is nothing going on.

52:11.980 --> 52:12.980
I've not seen it in the papers.

52:12.980 --> 52:13.980
It's just from you guys.

52:13.980 --> 52:14.980
I get all my gaming news.

52:14.980 --> 52:20.260
So when I'm in the store, you know you talk about a game, the store, a friend of the manager

52:20.260 --> 52:25.340
there and literally you see little kids coming up saying, can I buy this and he's blunt with

52:25.340 --> 52:30.340
them and says, do I look stupid, put it back, go away and he's so blunt with them and it

52:30.340 --> 52:31.340
just makes me laugh.

52:31.340 --> 52:32.340
That's great.

52:32.340 --> 52:35.580
That sounds like how my husband does.

52:35.580 --> 52:40.260
You don't get that level of rudeness here in America except in some certain cities.

52:40.260 --> 52:44.420
New York used to have that stigma but I don't know, in the recent years they're not so much

52:44.420 --> 52:46.420
the rude place anymore, and when I went there I had a great experience.

52:46.420 --> 52:51.420
I've been in a GameStop with Dan fully telling them to get out of the store and get their

52:51.420 --> 52:52.420
parents.

52:52.420 --> 52:53.420
Dan's rude, but in a funny way.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.420
That's why I married him.

52:54.420 --> 52:58.860
I was muffing to him and saying, that's not good customer service, but you work in a bank.

52:58.860 --> 53:02.780
There's rude, rude, and then there's rude funny, and Dan's rude funny.

53:02.780 --> 53:03.780
Yeah.

53:03.780 --> 53:04.780
All right.

53:04.780 --> 53:06.900
Somehow or another he gets away with it.

53:06.900 --> 53:12.660
I work for a bank myself, and there's a big difference in the level of customer, though.

53:12.660 --> 53:16.740
yeah well over here we've got like it's just local bank I mean it's national

53:16.740 --> 53:21.420
it's owned by RBS World Bank Scotland but not giving them advertising because

53:21.420 --> 53:25.720
I no longer work for them. I want to say real quick too on your second point about

53:25.720 --> 53:33.200
Outrun you know I I'm sure everybody has that one game they wish the damn 360

53:33.200 --> 53:36.520
would emulate already and the sad thing is we're gonna be waiting a long long

53:36.520 --> 53:40.480
time before they're all available. Usually when they get one they get about

53:40.480 --> 53:45.200
like 20, because you know they weren't targeting that Barbie adventure game.

53:45.200 --> 53:48.020
And I don't know how many times I've said this to people when they bitch about, why

53:48.020 --> 53:53.600
is Barbie emulatable and Outrun isn't?

53:53.600 --> 53:54.600
Well because...

53:54.600 --> 53:55.600
Not that I'm saying this.

53:55.600 --> 53:56.600
What did you say?

53:56.600 --> 53:57.600
Because Mattel paid for it?

53:57.600 --> 54:03.840
Well no, because Barbie is probably very similar in its design to, I don't know, Halo or one

54:03.840 --> 54:05.440
of the games that is already playable.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.240
I'm not trying to say Barbies like Halo.

54:07.240 --> 54:12.000
Go back to 8-bit and 16-bit emulation.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.040
It's almost the same way.

54:13.040 --> 54:15.240
For instance, the NES games.

54:15.240 --> 54:18.160
A lot of NES games are assigned to certain mappers.

54:18.160 --> 54:22.840
I don't want to get into too much detail, but all the NES games are on certain mappers.

54:22.840 --> 54:27.080
For a lot of these obscure Japanese titles, the reason why those were the last ones to

54:27.080 --> 54:32.120
be emulated on NES emulators is because their mappers were not one of the standard.

54:32.120 --> 54:34.800
I think there are five or six standard ones.

54:34.800 --> 54:36.200
The crazy ones are outside of that.

54:36.200 --> 54:39.800
You would have to basically write new code for each mapper.

54:39.800 --> 54:44.640
Take that idea and apply it to Xbox and Xbox 360, that's kind of what's going on.

54:44.640 --> 54:48.580
Is that, you know, when you unlock one big game, you might unlock a bunch of little crappy

54:48.580 --> 54:51.360
ones that were similar in design.

54:51.360 --> 54:55.960
But it's not that Xbox is targeting those crap games, it's that it just happens that

54:55.960 --> 55:00.840
they work so it can just boost their numbers, yippee.

55:00.840 --> 55:04.120
It brings, it raises the whole situation you said about PlayStation 3, they put simply

55:04.120 --> 55:08.160
just a Playstation in there but again with the Xbox because it was such a PC they've

55:08.160 --> 55:10.200
really hit a brick wall with it so.

55:10.200 --> 55:14.360
Well it was Microsoft's decision to go with the different graphics setup so you know it's

55:14.360 --> 55:18.180
it's uh they had to weigh that pro and con when they did it so they got to be responsible

55:18.180 --> 55:19.180
for that decision.

55:19.180 --> 55:23.000
Brilliant, alright well listen you set up that PayPal donation fund and I'll definitely

55:23.000 --> 55:24.320
do it for you guys coming over here.

55:24.320 --> 55:28.760
I appreciate it you're a you're a true trooper we appreciate you listening okay.

55:28.760 --> 55:29.760
Take care of yourselves.

55:29.760 --> 55:30.760
Thanks for calling in.

55:30.760 --> 55:31.760
Thanks for calling.

55:31.760 --> 55:32.760
Alright.

55:32.760 --> 55:33.760
Sleep well.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.060
Whenever he finally goes to sleep there.

55:36.060 --> 55:37.860
I wanted to point out here in the chatroom,

55:37.860 --> 55:40.560
Black Wolf, our buddy Bobby, over on...

55:40.560 --> 55:42.060
They're on Captain N again.

55:42.060 --> 55:42.560
Huh?

55:42.560 --> 55:43.560
They're on Captain N again.

55:43.560 --> 55:44.460
No, no, no, not Bobby.

55:44.460 --> 55:45.060
Bobby's saying...

55:45.060 --> 55:45.960
Well, he might be somewhere else,

55:45.960 --> 55:49.160
but Bobby is saying they did target Big Mother Truckers.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.360
Why?

55:52.360 --> 55:54.460
Because there's a certain demographic that goes for that,

55:54.460 --> 55:54.960
you know, and let's...

55:54.960 --> 55:56.260
And they're all in this...

55:56.260 --> 55:57.160
Yeah, I know, I know.

55:57.160 --> 55:58.660
Let's do one more call here.

55:58.660 --> 55:59.660
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

55:59.660 --> 56:00.260
Who's this?

56:00.260 --> 56:02.160
It's the one and only man.

56:02.160 --> 56:07.300
It's the one and only choppy legend of Zaku who is choppy, choppy in and out, who needs

56:07.300 --> 56:09.380
to turn off the porn torrents.

56:09.380 --> 56:10.380
What's up?

56:10.380 --> 56:16.380
All right, I got word on the street that Supernova is coming out this Wednesday in Dave & Buster's

56:16.380 --> 56:17.660
in Times Square.

56:17.660 --> 56:21.780
And for the three or four listeners we have in Times Square, they're going to be really

56:21.780 --> 56:22.780
happy.

56:22.780 --> 56:29.860
It's been confirmed by folks who are on the inside of the company and the people that

56:29.860 --> 56:30.860
work there.

56:30.860 --> 56:36.260
Since I'm 21, that's a definite of me actually going there that Wednesday.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.260
Okay.

56:37.260 --> 56:39.300
Hooray for you, but what about the rest of us?

56:39.300 --> 56:41.580
We have listeners in New York.

56:41.580 --> 56:47.860
I understand that, but we have lots of listeners, a fraction of which live in New York.

56:47.860 --> 56:55.460
What I'm trying to get at, the point is, is this going to be a trend for Dave & Busters

56:55.460 --> 56:58.300
because there are lots of Dave & Busters everywhere?

56:58.300 --> 57:03.300
What I'm hearing is that they're going to phase out their pump it up machines and supernovas.

57:03.300 --> 57:06.260
Ooh, Miglotov's going to be pissed.

57:06.260 --> 57:07.740
That's what I'm hearing right there.

57:07.740 --> 57:09.500
They're trying to use that as a replacement.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.740
Now the DDR's gone legit here.

57:11.740 --> 57:12.740
Interesting.

57:12.740 --> 57:15.180
Well, we'll see what happens.

57:15.180 --> 57:16.580
Have fun with your supernova.

57:16.580 --> 57:18.660
I guess take pictures, send us a review.

57:18.660 --> 57:22.620
If you want any reviews or any info, I should be able to provide it by next Sunday.

57:22.620 --> 57:24.740
Well, I don't want to sound like a jerk.

57:24.740 --> 57:27.900
We did kind of get to play it at E3.

57:27.900 --> 57:29.900
This one will be the final one, though.

57:29.900 --> 57:31.900
Alright, well let us know if there's anything different.

57:31.900 --> 57:34.900
That's what I want to know. If there's anything different from what we saw at E3, then let us know.

57:34.900 --> 57:36.900
Alright, I'll give you back the skinny.

57:36.900 --> 57:38.900
Alright, Zach, we gotta go. We got more calls coming in.

57:38.900 --> 57:39.900
Alright.

57:39.900 --> 57:40.900
Have a good one, buddy.

57:40.900 --> 57:41.900
Bye.

57:41.900 --> 57:44.900
Have fun in your Times Square. Actually, I do love Times Square, though.

57:44.900 --> 57:45.900
I love New York City.

57:45.900 --> 57:48.900
If you do live there and listen to this show, you're lucky, because I do love that place.

57:48.900 --> 57:52.900
Let's go to another phone call. Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

57:52.900 --> 57:56.900
Sky, I was joking about Big Mother Truckers.

57:56.900 --> 57:58.900
Hi Bobby!

57:58.900 --> 58:00.900
Are you kidding?

58:00.900 --> 58:02.900
You know what, you can't say things in chat like that

58:02.900 --> 58:04.900
without putting a JK or something

58:04.900 --> 58:06.900
I don't know

58:06.900 --> 58:08.900
I put the JK, it was silent

58:08.900 --> 58:10.900
It was on the internet, therefore it must be true

58:10.900 --> 58:12.900
Alright

58:12.900 --> 58:14.900
You got me

58:14.900 --> 58:16.900
And for that

58:16.900 --> 58:18.900
since you got me, I will let you pimp your show

58:18.900 --> 58:20.900
Go for it

58:20.900 --> 58:22.900
Oh, my show?

58:22.900 --> 58:24.900
My show is the Bobby Black Wolf Show

58:24.900 --> 58:29.700
about how table tennis does actually have a whore in it.

58:29.700 --> 58:31.020
Yesper!

58:31.020 --> 58:32.020
His name is Yesper.

58:32.020 --> 58:33.620
He is a whore.

58:33.620 --> 58:36.780
And anybody who's played table tennis knows Yesper's a big whore.

58:36.780 --> 58:37.900
Yes he is.

58:37.900 --> 58:38.900
So I just want to clear that up.

58:38.900 --> 58:39.900
Alright, no problem.

58:39.900 --> 58:40.900
Also, Bobby.

58:40.900 --> 58:41.900
Yes?

58:41.900 --> 58:42.900
You win a no-prize.

58:42.900 --> 58:43.900
Okay.

58:43.900 --> 58:44.900
What?

58:44.900 --> 58:48.740
I've been back in my X-Men fandoms to get the no-prize.

58:48.740 --> 58:50.460
Just smile and nod at Dark Sakura tonight.

58:50.460 --> 58:52.180
She's had one too many espresso brownies.

58:52.180 --> 58:53.180
I had one!

58:53.180 --> 58:54.180
I had one!

58:54.180 --> 58:59.400
one too many and a banana coconut frappuccino which is crack and captain

58:59.400 --> 59:05.500

59:18.940 --> 59:22.400
more call I lied before and I said that Zach would be the last we're doing one

59:22.400 --> 59:24.400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

59:24.400 --> 59:25.400
Hi, this is Anoush.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.400
Hi Anoush, what's on your mind?

59:27.400 --> 59:29.400
Oh, I did butcher your name earlier, didn't I?

59:29.400 --> 59:33.400
Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.400
What's on your mind Anoush?

59:34.400 --> 59:36.400
Just a quick question.

59:36.400 --> 59:43.400
Do you guys think that Sony is just going to surprise us all right at launch with all these games and things that no one was expecting?

59:43.400 --> 59:48.400
Whoa, it's like the remix, it's echoing there.

59:48.400 --> 59:51.400
Careful buddy, turn down your volume there, that was kind of weird.

59:51.400 --> 59:55.400
I don't think so because Sony isn't very smart.

59:55.400 --> 59:59.400
I disagree.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.400
I think Sony has surprises left in store. I think

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.400
they have to. I think Sony

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.400
is going to have to do something to make up for E3.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.400
And I don't know what that is, but it will be a surprise when it's said.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.400
I don't see that Sony is going to leave themselves in this hole that they've dug.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.400
Doug.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.460
What they need to do is they need to gag everybody at that company, shut the F up, do not talk

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:31.280
about PS3 anymore, stop talking to the gaming press, and then two months before the system

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:37.520
comes out we will have the bang up press conference, we'll have a do-over, and do it right this

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520
time.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.520
I hear that echo again, sorry.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.000
Sorry, I'm leaving a mic for my MacBook Pro.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
That's alright.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.080
Anoush, any other thoughts on that that you want to share?

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.000
really okay well thanks for the question but I've I got to hang up cuz the echo

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.660
is driving me nuts

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.660
I love what Zander K said in the chat

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.660
What did Zander K say?

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.660
It kinda sounds like my wife's breast pump

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.660
Gross!

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.660
That's so nasty

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.660
That was freaky

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.660
Sky's voice second mix from Dark Tetsuya

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.660
That sounded scary

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.220
like I don't know like I was in poltergeist or something all right any

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.220
Any last minute stories here in studio?

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:26.580
Well, I was going to mention since we talked about Table Tennis that Grand Theft Auto IV

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:32.580
is actually going to be using Table Tennis's graphic engine called Rage, Rockstar's advanced

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:37.460
game engine, for Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's going to be pretty sweet.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.400
Okay, yeah, Table Tennis is a good looking game, let's hope it carries over into Grand

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.540
Theft Auto, I'm sure it will, I have no doubt it will look sexy, I'm sure.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:53.780
Sakura do you have anything well there is a list out a very special list okay

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.860
this is basically the list of games that have been released since Duke Nukem

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:12.140

some fun facts it says in 1997 the fastest consumer internet connection was

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.480
There's a 33.6 kbps modem.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:15.820
On average, consumer internet connections were 300 times faster today.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:23.060
When Duke Nukem Forever was announced, the fastest processor was a 233 MHz Pentium.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:28.800
In April 1997, there was no Google and there was no eBay.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800
Wait a minute.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800
No, there was eBay.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800
There was eBay.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.440
It just was not even what it was now.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.040
There was no weblog.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.560
And as far as disasters, it says there's been 125 hurricanes happened since then, 20 death

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.520
toll-producing tornado outbreaks in the United States, and 50 major earthquakes in the world.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.520
In other words, it's been a long freaking time since I announced Duke Nukem.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.640
Britney Spears' entire musical career as a pop star took place since the announcement.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.520
Somebody had a lot of free time on their hands when they did this.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.520
This is fabulous.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.520
I love it.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.320
Yes, this is great.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:07.640
40 new members have been elected to the Senate, Bill Clinton finished his presidential term

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:13.400
and George Bush came on, 4 nations acquired nuclear weapons technology, 19 wars have begun

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.560
and 5 wars have ended.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.360
Blaze wants to know why this wasn't the side of the week.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.040
Because I didn't think about it because we wanted to do sexy Roth and we had already

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.160
decided last week.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.280
I'm logging into eBay right now to see when I actually...

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.180
worth a mention most assuredly and I think whoever sent it to me

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.580
I'm logging in to see when I bought something on eBay

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.780
I bought something on eBay look at this on my feedback prompt response and payment

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.940
a pleasure to do business with

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:45.940
April 26 1997 was when that feedback was left on my account

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:51.620
I'm old school I have a feedback rating of three because the last time I bought

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.480
something from eBay

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.220
you know when the last feedback was left 99 I remember though I bought Super Metro

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.300
Oh, none of you care. Why am I talking about none of you care?

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.700
We have one more phone call because I forgot I promised this person they could be on tonight higher on orange launch radio

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:10.840
Who's this? I didn't know as a promise. Hey, it's dmn. Hi dmn. Yeah, I remember saying something about it. What's on your mind?

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.640
Um, well, I found out how to give away the Wii

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.080
Okay, that's right. You're giving away a Wii. Yes. Okay. How you gonna give away a Wii?

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:26.760
Well because I'm a huge fan of interactivity just like you guys are people who come listen live in the chat room and

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.980
argue appropriately with your discussion get points the more points they get the

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:36.540
more stuff they get if they win during the week right now actually a funny

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:41.060
Dale's kicking everyone's ass they get a t-shirt from Nintendo so funny Dale's

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:47.340
not just a clever name no all right um the highest average score you got to do

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:54.220
at least six of these you get a we Wow so so in other words you have this

01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:00.320
completely subjective system that you just are going to pretty much give the system to

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.580
whoever you think is the funniest?

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.020
Not necessarily the funniest, whoever brings the better arguments.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.020
Whoever is the wittiest?

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.020
Yes.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.020
Oh, get it?

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.020
The wittiest!

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.020
Yeah.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.020
Do I get points for that?

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.020
Yeah, the joke's like that.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.020
I get points for that?

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.020
Ah, damn it.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.420
Well, everybody, good luck.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.980
I hope it brings a lot more people in the chat room.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.260
What do the hosts get out of this?

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.760
Because I noticed you've been rating the hosts, too.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.720
You guys just get points for the hell of it.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.700
You guys just need to ask me and I'll get you stuff.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.700
You know how that works.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.700
I want a Wii.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.700
I want a Wii.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.700
I want a Wii.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:39.300
No, if you send us the communal Wii, we'll fight to the death over it.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.420
That'll be Orange Lounge Battle Royale.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.780
We'll tape it and put it on YouTube.

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.780
It'll be on my MySpace profile.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:53.100
Speaking of Nintendo stuff, they've got some new videos of Super Paper Mario on YouTube.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.100
Sexy!

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.140
From the World Hobby Fair, and they look awesome.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.400
Show me, show me, show me!

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.400
I know it's radio, I don't care, show me.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.180
I haven't seen the game come through where I am yet, so, um.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.060
Have you seen the Wii yet?

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.060
Nope.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.620
Oh, damn.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.980
October dates looking bleaker and bleaker.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.940
From what I've heard, and don't quote me on this, it'll probably start in August.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:17.020
okay well what does that mean if it tests in August? Does that mean we might still

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.780
see October?

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.780
I don't know

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.300
I don't know how long the DS was in testing

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.580
uh...

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:29.660
and even if I don't think I'd be at liberty to say. Okay I don't want you to

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.820
lose your job I guess I better have you be quiet

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:37.780
uh... but other than that yeah that's pretty much all I got

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:41.140
yeah I'm gonna let you guys go and finish up your show. Alright

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.900
Well, thank you for the contest and encouraging folks to interact with us live on Sunday nights

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:52.260
at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on Orangelaunchradio.com because you might win DMN's Wii.

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.260
Whoa.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.380
Well, you said it.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:57.580
That is what they are going to win your Wii, right?

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.580
Sure.

01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.580
All right.

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.580
Have a good one, buddy.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.580
Take care, man.

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.580
Later.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.580
Thanks.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.580
Bye.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:05.580
He rocks.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:09.300
Not only does he give us insider scoop, but he gives stuff away just because he loves

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.060
you guys.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.960
We love you guys, too, but we gotta go.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.320
We're done for tonight.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.440
No more show for us.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.320
I need ice cream.

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.280
So thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight.

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.480
We really appreciate it.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:23.760
And thank you for supporting internet radio.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.560
Thank you for supporting independent internet radio.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.440
And thanks to you guys for listening to us every week.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.560
We appreciate it, and we'll see you back here next week.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.760
Next week is a big show.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:35.600
It's a big show.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.880
Do you know why next week is a big show?

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.080
Because...

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.740
Because we said so.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.500
because it's our birthday.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.700
Yeah, we're gonna be this many.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.300
We're gonna be four years old

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:49.340
and I'm hoping somebody brings cake next week.

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.620
A chocolate cake.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.860
We need a cake in the shape of a cock.

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:54.740
Okay.

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:58.120
Okay, well we'll go let Jamie take out

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.220
whatever aggression she needs to do right now.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.540
I want a cake in the shape of a mumbler.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.180
Fuck that, I just want an ice cream cake.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.220
Is that too much to ask?

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.240
Let's just go get ice cream.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.720
All right, that's it.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.520
We'll see you back here next week

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.380
for our fourth anniversary show.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.520
Hopefully some guests coming out of the woodwork here.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.960
Again, we're kinda trying to save all the fireworks

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.360
for episode 200, which is coming up,

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.200
because that's the bigger deal to me, I don't know.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.200
And because Fourth of July will have come around

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.560
and we can purchase fireworks.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.620
That's true, that's a good point.

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.880
So we'll see you back here.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.900
Regardless, we'll have something special,

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.140
I'm sure, next week for our fourth birthday.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.360
So tune in then, and thank you guys once again

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.320
for supporting us, we really appreciate it.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.400
Alright, one more thing we gotta do before we gotta go though, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.860
Loki, your final thought.

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:51.520
Super Paper Mario looks awesome, in fact you can switch dimensions in the game, that's pretty sweet.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.480
My final thought is, I have new t-shirts coming next week and I'm very excited

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.640
from the internet, because the internet sells funny t-shirts.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.860
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.200
Loco Roco!

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.200
And reject false icons. See you next time.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:20.560
Thank you.
