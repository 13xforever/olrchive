487	19091	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19989	25432	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 187 for this June 18th, 2006.
27113	28614	And let's get right back into the news.
28634	31756	We're going to start it off with Loki has a story about the PlayStation 3.
32337	34978	Yes, don't we always have a story about the PlayStation 3?
35358	36439	Well, it is newsworthy.
36839	37520	Exactly.
38680	45965	Basically, now the whole thing coming out with the PlayStation 3 is, what's it going to be like with retailers?
46665	47706	Am I going to be able to get one?
48226	49607	What kind of quantities can we expect?
50319	66971	Well, according to Games First, they had an internal GameStop email which expressed concern over how many PS3s their chain, which is the largest chain out there, including eBay games, would have available.
67311	76978	And a local store that would be receiving between 50 to 100 Xbox 360s at launch, and that wasn't very many, is expected to get no more than 20 PS3s.
76998	77078	So...
79761	82463	If this is true, that's going to suck.
83864	88107	Or, it's not going to matter because people won't be buying them.
88407	89548	I don't want to be a jerk.
89668	96013	I don't want to be the anti-Sony guy because I'm really trying to give everybody a fair shot here, even if I'm being constantly disappointed over there.
96393	101257	But, is it realistic that there's going to be as many people that want the PlayStation 3 as one at Xbox 360?
101297	101657	I don't know.
101797	102298	That's the thing.
103098	105320	I think there will be a lot of people wanting it, but...
106308	106768	I'm not sure.
107269	112633	It will still be a clusterfuck like the 360 launch was, I think.
114535	119239	I don't think that they're going to be having trouble selling those 20 units.
119259	120860	That's why I think it's going to be a problem, though.
121441	125184	But are those 20 units just going to end up on Craigslist, eBay, etc.?
125224	126365	Yeah, they will.
127546	127866	Sad.
127986	129707	People learned that they can do that.
129767	130648	Sad, sad, sad.
130668	130848	Okay.
135100	136861	Any way that we can dodge this?
137142	144587	Or is this just brace yourselves, get your pre-orders in ASAP as soon as they'll start taking them or have a game plan if you really want this?
144607	145007	Pretty much, yeah.
145607	146468	All right, heads up.
146928	148869	Hope you learned from the Xbox 360 experience.
150110	152232	Moving on to a completely different topic.
152372	159637	Well, it does have to do with the next generation of gaming, but it's an old game, very, very old game, making its way into the next generation of gaming.
159657	160057	Yes, Jamie?
160277	161418	This makes my heart happy.
162149	164232	Dragon's Lair, Sega CD, Arcade Emulator
174264	177005	I have it on our two copies on DVD.
177205	179586	What is it about the game that you love so much?
179667	184249	Because honestly, if you just memorize the... That doesn't matter.
184329	185609	It's Don Bluth animation.
185669	186510	It's just so cool.
186950	189691	And it's neat watching all the different ways he turns into a skeleton and dies.
190371	193093	And on top of that, it's just really fun.
193193	197615	So Digital Leisure is bringing it out in high definition for the PC.
198750	199751	Oh, for the PC.
200291	206354	Now, which means that I'm basically going to be hooking it up through my laptop to our 50-inch widescreen and playing the hell out of it.
206835	207735	That's going to be kind of cool.
208015	210457	So imagine how that's going to look on my TV.
210657	211217	But wait a minute.
211237	214179	These cartoons were made in 83 or something, right?
214219	215479	It's still awesome.
215960	218041	Is it really going to look that much different in HD?
218141	218761	Or what are they going to do?
218801	220422	Are they going to redo it or anything?
220442	225825	They're basically taking the original footage from what I understand and redoing it for high definition.
225845	226866	That might be cool.
226886	226926	So...
227706	232210	But imagine, when it first came out, it was on Laserdisc.
232751	237775	So it was the cleanest thing out there in the 80s as far as its resolution.
238035	242839	It was cleaner than almost anything that you'd get at your house for any type of animation.
242959	247924	So by that respect, I'm actually pretty excited about this.
247984	251887	And also they're going to be following up with Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.
253188	253969	Time warp!
254970	255310	All right.
256190	258774	Interesting thought there from Xander K in our chatroom.
258834	261518	Dragon's Lair for Xbox Live Arcade, Xander says.
261538	261798	I don't know.
261838	262880	It might be a little big.
262900	263361	A little big.
264102	264903	XBOX ARCADE GAME
293917	295558	probably, what, 40, 50 megs?
295958	302081	I think it's 50 megs because they have to keep it under the size of the memory card.
302941	312826	So, a 700 meg game versus, and that's also not counting, we have to include audio with that.
313106	318768	I'm sure compression technology is a lot better now than it was then, but still, keep that in mind.
319049	321009	We're talking about full solid animation.
321049	322070	I doubt that it's going to
322924	328176	really be able to pull out well, at least and maintain proper resolution.
328636	338004	GS191 in our chatroom, orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat, says Sky, they're going back to old 30s and 40s movies and remastering them in HD and they look damn good to boot.
338464	344148	Okay, I have seen some of the old movies on the HD channels we have here and they look pretty good.
344188	347411	I mean, they still look dated, but okay, I'm willing to give it a fair shot.
347451	349232	Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Dragon's Lair.
349353	354857	It's a neat, I just love the concept and it's a very unique type of game.
355077	363279	Also in the next few weeks, keep your eye on our stuff at stuff.orangechallengeradio.com, our blog, for a review.
364439	366040	Oh, someone's getting the hookup.
366600	367080	Someone is.
367160	367500	Sweet.
367900	373361	Now, also our chat room brings up, I want to say it was VX, JasonXV, Dark Knight, somebody over there was talking about Space Ace.
373782	375882	So if we get success with Dragon's Lair.
375902	376282	They did Space Ace.
376682	378563	Oh, they're going to do Space Ace HD and all that good stuff?
378583	379703	They said it.
379743	383924	Actually, the next one out should be Space Ace, and let me double check it once more.
385887	388268	Next Out Space, AceHD, and Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp
406665	416774	Speaking of taking old games and making them new all over again, the Xbox 360 got a backwards compatibility update this week, and 21 new games are playable.
418055	422319	I think 7 more in Japan, so you get 28 if you're Japan.
422559	424061	But 21 new games are now playable.
424521	432268	Amp 2, Doom 3, Fatal Frame, Silent Hill 4, LEGO Star Wars, Minority Report...
433269	439914	Spider-Man, Spawn Armageddon, Star Wars Battlefront, The Punisher, just to name a few on the list there.
439954	442276	If you want to see the full list, head on over to Xbox.com.
442296	444258	They've updated their backwards compatibility list.
444858	448882	I will say I did pop in my copy of Silent Hill 4 The Room just to kind of check out, see what it looked like.
449242	450483	It looked really clean.
450743	452705	Like, it does look better than it does on the Xbox.
452745	454126	I don't know what it is about it.
454166	456248	I don't know if the software is uprising it or something, but...
456568	457509	The game looked pretty nice.
458350	465836	It doesn't look 360 game quality, but it's definitely a little bitty baby step up from the Xbox, so I was pretty impressed.
466456	473482	I am kind of sad, though, that still it's not... Most of my collection I still cannot play on the 360.
473522	475804	The majority of it I still can't play.
476545	477205	So, hmm.
477746	478006	Kind of.
479144	479444	I don't know.
479704	481926	I don't know how long it'll take before we can play more of them.
481946	482306	We'll see.
482486	483747	Do you think they're going to keep going?
483787	486628	I heard Peter Moore took back what he had said last week and all that stuff.
486948	495393	Do you think they're going to go back and really take an effort to make all or at least all of the top 100 best-selling games playable?
495573	508100	Or do you think this is something that slowly is going to phase out and Microsoft's just going to try and give us new stuff to make us forget about this whole mistake of not having these
508479	509880	Backwards Compatibility Games Sooner
539571	540591	But I'm not, so I don't care.
540852	541932	Well, but, I don't know.
542052	542332	I don't know.
542352	543513	Maybe they have to patch them all at once.
543573	543873	I don't know.
544833	545173	Who knows?
545213	548875	Anyway, Microsoft's making a lot of interesting statements this week.
548915	549335	Yes, Loki?
550015	552436	Well, sorta, yeah.
552496	555338	I mean, it's somebody on their development staff.
555438	567943	But anyways, Microsoft's Matt Lee, a developer in Microsoft's game technology group, said, and I quote, Japan's not necessarily the most important market for gaming these days.
569023	573605	It's also not quite as large as the US and European markets.
574566	575586	That's hilarious.
578467	583610	I think everybody out there... Well, Nintendo's doing a good job of not saying anything.
584150	591373	I think that unless you're the PR guy at Microsoft or you're the PR guy over at Sony...
592332	598357	You should probably shut the hell up about everything because you're just digging yourself into a hole.
621690	626294	Stock prices, not that important.
626354	628476	What's important is what color our consoles come in.
629978	630838	That's damn important.
633100	635002	I don't know, DarkSakura, what do you think about that statement?
635222	639266	The whole Japan is not that important.
639907	641248	That's utter crap.
641548	642349	I mean, think about it.
643783	654389	It's not just a big market for the fact that there are people who stand in line for new releases of games who basically are stalkerish over voice actors for games.
655010	657791	We're importing games from there because they're better than what we have here.
659152	665696	That's just complete and utter crap to say that the market is just not as important as the fact that they are not properly catering to that market.
666383	677714	Do you think that we might have a biased perspective being that the background on this program, we've always kind of been fans kind of geared towards that Japanese import audience or kind of more of the games we play.
678094	682999	But in the bigger picture... I'm referring over just to the social side that games have.
683539	690446	You know, I look at our, you know, the fan base for a lot of these games is a lot bigger than...
691420	700707	Then, of course, it is here, because here, to us, it's niche, but to a lot of the fandom groups there, there's a lot bigger crowd, I think.
701308	705851	You've got those people that are going to stand in line for a new RPG.
707339	710980	Where we have the Madden crowds are just a few people at a time, pretty much.
711460	716061	It may be a busier sales day, but you don't have people just hanging out in lines outside of stores.
716661	720522	Or going to meet so-and-so voice actor who was in this game.
720942	721862	That doesn't happen here.
722722	723482	Games are a lot.
724082	727563	Not just the fact that there's a big market for it.
728043	729563	It's a big social thing, too.
730284	731284	A lot bigger than it is here.
731304	732084	And that's just in general.
734741	736927	For us it's niche, over there it's a lot bigger.
737563	739364	PSP Unit, AC Adapter, Battery Pack, 32MB Card
764120	765080	and LocoRoco.
765120	771782	It's all packaged together in a special box and it comes out July 13th for 24,800 yen.
772222	774843	Also has a special LocoRoco case that goes with it.
775463	777363	I have the special Katamari case.
778583	779484	What do you think?
779784	780064	Cool?
780264	780964	Worth importing?
781164	783044	Well, I guess you already have a PSP so maybe not.
783405	787826	It's cool, I mean, but honestly I've already got a PSP.
788766	789726	I just care about the game.
791636	792376	That's still kind of neat, though.
792396	795237	And I already have a cool case running, because Dan got me the one that came out with me and my Katamari.
796957	797457	Which I don't have.
798457	801458	Well, for those of you guys that love to import things, maybe there'll be something there.
802098	803398	Uh, DarkS... Oh, yeah?
803418	808139	Just like getting all the stuff that came with Poppin' Music 11, getting teacups and towels.
808259	810180	They got some crazy collector editions in Japan.
810200	811220	I'll tell you what I have.
811240	820622	I have, on Dreamcast, I have the Cardcaptor Sakura game that came with a pillowcase, a plate, a spoon, a fork, and a clock.
821246	821806	A wall clock.
824729	825009	Wow.
825469	827071	And would you actually use any of that stuff?
827251	828372	Or is it just collector stuff?
828772	829573	It's collector stuff.
829933	832875	Although I might put the clock up when we make my art room.
833316	833536	Oh, cool.
834016	835517	Because I love my Cardcaptor Sakura clock.
836578	838080	DarkSakura, take us to our next story.
839140	840001	A bunch of stuff happened.
841002	841762	Okay, actually, yeah.
841783	842803	Very descriptive, thank you.
843444	849369	There was an article for the Question of the Week on Gamasutra about...
850583	857928	In an interview with Chris Crawford, basically, he was the creator of Balance of Power.
858028	862351	He was basically saying new ideas don't go anywhere, so the industry is just rehashing the same stuff over and over again.
862771	869236	There's nothing inherently wrong with recycling the same thing over and over and over, but how do you know what you're missing if you're not trying?
869276	871437	Has anyone noticed that we don't appeal to the general public?
871597	872758	Well, that's a quote from him.
873793	880296	So there's a new question now that's on their question of the week page, and I'll get a link to that momentarily.
881037	893183	But it's, what examples of innovation in design business or other areas do you think disprove the notion that the game industry is not evolving as quickly as it should be, or is Chris Crawford right?
893743	901367	So that's actually pretty interesting, I think, being that I've always thought that innovation needs to happen in games.
902185	904887	I think that we need to be seeing more of that.
905427	916013	So the actual article, if you go onto Gamasutra's website, it's got a pretty big URL.
916033	917333	Just look for the June 14th story.
917754	918554	There'll be a link to that.
918594	925678	And I would actually really like to see some of our people, some of our listeners, I should say, respond to that.
926218	927419	I'm actually curious myself.
927539	929140	Actually, send us an email to
929659	935141	Mailbag at orangejonesradio.com because I'd actually like to air some of the same responses here on the show too.
936362	937062	I guess we'll see.
937102	938043	More to come then on that.
938363	938503	Yeah.
938523	939323	All the feedback thing.
939563	941344	I think that that's a pretty good question.
941864	944526	I'm trying to see if there's any response there in our chat room.
944806	946646	They're still all over at orangejonesradio.com.
946687	947167	Click on chat.
947187	951709	They're still all consumed there with the Cardcaptor Sakura pack that you have there.
952389	954450	Okay, I'll put pictures of it up on our site.
954590	956831	Okay, DarkTetsuya says, here's a comment relating to that.
956911	959072	DarkTetsuya says, well, what's more innovative than the Wii?
962000	962380	Interesting.
963321	966622	Wii is getting a lot of brownie points for being innovative.
966882	969303	A very innovative system.
969423	970784	I say you write that down.
971404	972584	Send that in, DarkTetsuya.
974245	974925	Moving on.
975005	975466	Loki.
976606	977246	Nintendo.
977346	979287	Speaking of the Wii, what's Nintendo up to?
979787	990752	Well, Nintendo has a new Club Nintendo, which is, I guess, a brand new website that they're launching that you can get a ton of really exclusive...
991425	993369	Nintendo stuff.
993529	995352	I mean, everything they've got.
995432	999860	For example, some different notebooks.
999921	1000642	You can get tape
1001720	1003461	I have Animal Crossing characters on it.
1004362	1011306	They've got these folders that have Mario stuff on there.
1012026	1021352	Some of my favorites, they have a DS case that holds nine different styluses, all different colors of the rainbow, and nine games that's available.
1021992	1025753	Also some multicolored DS Lite cases.
1027133	1032475	You've got a Mario, kind of like a bookshelf for your Nintendo DS games.
1033255	1045278	And then probably the best thing out of all of them on there, an exclusive Nintendo DS game, the Game & Watch Collection, where you can play Game & Watch games on your DS.
1045765	1046125	Happy!
1046645	1049186	Allow me to be the first to say, Game & Watch games sucked.
1049226	1049926	Why would I want this?
1050227	1051367	Ah, Game & Watch!
1051647	1054388	Outside of nostalgia value.
1054408	1055948	They totally kicked the ass of Tiger Toys.
1058349	1059089	I guess.
1059170	1059610	I don't know.
1059730	1061150	For Japan only, unfortunately.
1061630	1065992	But if you're wanting to check it out, it's... Ah, you know that shit will show up on eBay.
1066112	1070653	Club.nintendo.jp slash new underscore present.
1071654	1072394	And there you go.
1075194	1078396	Alright, moving on to another story.
1078496	1081537	Speaking of the Wii as well, DarkSakura has a story relating to the Wii.
1082117	1082958	Yeah, I sure do.
1083798	1085279	So, who's a fan of Call of Duty 3?
1085979	1086980	All five people?
1087100	1087740	No, kidding.
1087800	1089301	It's a hugely successful game.
1089561	1090621	Maybe not in this room.
1091042	1092182	Hey, I love Call of Duty.
1092742	1094363	I'm going to be honest, never played it.
1094383	1099766	It's just not my... One out of three Orangels most agree Call of Duty is top notch.
1100066	1100446	It's just...
1101383	1103866	I'm so burned out on the War Sim.
1104006	1104827	It's just not my kind of thing.
1104847	1106269	Maybe you should borrow mine.
1106289	1107390	But it's just not my kind of thing.
1107410	1110494	Fine, I will borrow it and give it a chance, but it's just not really my kind of game.
1110734	1114078	I just... I got plenty of other crap to play.
1114579	1116962	We've got details for Call of... I said Tooties.
1117386	1119127	We've got details for Call of Duty.
1119147	1119687	Call of Duty.
1119767	1120308	Call of Booty.
1121028	1122849	There should be a new name for Call of Duty.
1122869	1125130	Wow, lots of Call of Duty fans everywhere.
1125170	1127771	Just got a fan about five times in the past 60 seconds.
1127791	1133755	Listen, Call of Duty, you know, if you're going to be calling in, like, duty, that was last week's show, okay?
1134135	1134715	Call of Duty.
1134895	1135315	Anyway.
1137176	1137877	Yes, Call of Duty 3.
1138637	1145901	So, um, there's details on the Wii version of Call of Duty 3, which, I don't know how that's going to work out, but, um,
1146661	1167562	at any rate they're basically working on having it they actually don't have a release date scheduled for the Wii release but they are going to say it's going to be released this year speculation is pointing out November around Thanksgiving there hasn't been any real
1168687	1170048	Gameplay, I think.
1170709	1178834	They're just saying, though, that what they're working on is actually using the Wii Remote for position pointing, for that type of thing.
1180255	1183898	That's pretty... It doesn't sound like they're very far along, and they're going to have that thing out at the end of the year?
1183918	1184819	That's pretty aggressive.
1185499	1186140	I'd say so.
1186360	1187461	I'd be alarmed at that.
1187641	1193185	I mean, no matter what type of game it is, if they're still kind of early on here, and they're trying to get that out by the end of the year.
1193685	1196847	But they're basically saying that they're going to center the...
1197972	1200132	Redicule on the screen so that you use the controller.
1202033	1202733	Innovative idea.
1203513	1208434	Different, but... It sounds very similar to Red Steel.
1209854	1211354	The way they move from that.
1214015	1214315	Alright.
1214775	1215535	Interesting.
1216415	1218295	Then we shall move on, yes?
1218716	1219016	Let's!
1219156	1219456	Alright.
1219856	1227477	Tomb Raider was going to be remade for the PSP, but then there was an announcement on Core Design's website that said it was cancelled.
1228466	1238478	The video of Tomb Raider 10th Anniversary that appeared on certain sites was an unauthorized release of an internal presentation of a game that was being developed by Core Design until very recently.
1238918	1241521	It was running on PSP and used Core Developed Engine.
1241901	1245946	However, following a recent review, this project has been officially cancelled by SCI.
1246696	1248717	But is Tomb Raider really cancelled?
1248777	1252819	Because Eurogamer came out and said, no, the remake isn't cancelled.
1253299	1256941	SCI just issued a new statement saying that, hey, it's back on.
1257461	1267265	So apparently not only are you going to be able to download Tomb Raider through this whole, you know, PSP, download the PlayStation 1 games thing, but now there's going to be an official remake on the PSP.
1268046	1270007	Much like there was for Twisted Metal 2.
1270527	1273528	I mean, Twisted Metal, whatever the hell it was called.
1273848	1274849	I had that game too, and
1275799	1276620	Very disappointing.
1277000	1279382	A launch game that's actually a rehash of an old game.
1281383	1281824	Interesting.
1282484	1284486	I'm kind of burned out on Tomb Raider.
1284526	1289069	Tomb Raider was cool many years ago when it was on the PC and it was cutting edge at the time.
1289089	1291651	I don't know how excited I would be about a remake.
1291971	1296375	I was not a fan of the Xbox 360 one, the recent one that just came out.
1296715	1297376	I got my hands on.
1297396	1298697	It just wasn't for me.
1300238	1300678	Loki.
1300838	1302840	Speaking of upgrades of old games...
1303416	1305098	Yeah, Final Fantasy VII.
1306459	1308901	We've seen websites taking pre-orders for it.
1309762	1315867	And, well, Square's come out and, of course, said, Final Fantasy VII Remake on PlayStation 3.
1317488	1321472	Basically, we haven't confirmed that's in development.
1323334	1326596	But we have confirmed that Final Fantasy XIII's in development.
1327457	1328918	And so far, there's no...
1330660	1334161	They're not working on a Final Fantasy 7 remake Will it happen?
1334401	1354169	Probably So they didn't say no They didn't say no, they're just not working on it They just said, we haven't said it Yeah And fanboys everywhere still have hope And it's basically, we have not confirmed a Final Fantasy remake at any time So, we haven't confirmed it, but we didn't say no Maybe we're doing it, and maybe we're not
1354964	1356005	I'm not going to tell you.
1356405	1357966	They're doing it, okay?
1359167	1361448	That's just... They're doing it.
1362429	1363129	That's my theory.
1363329	1363910	They're doing it.
1364030	1365671	If they did it, would anyone care?
1365811	1367552	They're doing Final Fantasy everything else.
1367612	1368032	Why not?
1368232	1372055	Tweak in our chatroom says Final Fantasy VII was good, but it's time to move on, people.
1372495	1373676	I wouldn't mind it looking pretty.
1374656	1380220	Jada2006 seems to think they will move on after one more thing with the Final Fantasy VII franchise.
1380240	1382041	I think it would be cool to see them remake VI.
1383148	1383769	That would be cool.
1384149	1385570	I'd like to see them go back and do 4 or 6.
1385610	1386511	I did find something cool.
1387331	1391155	On YouTube, I found the Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy 6 demo.
1391555	1393436	Oh, yeah, you brought this up on a previous show before.
1393456	1397119	I had been looking and looking and looking, and finally I was like, let me look on YouTube, and the whole thing's there.
1397320	1399141	Because everything's on YouTube.
1399281	1402103	I'm in a video on YouTube somewhere, randomly.
1402464	1405486	I honestly, though, do wish that they would remake Final Fantasy 7.
1405967	1407528	Not for PlayStation 3, but you know...
1408769	1409650	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1427117	1428578	I wouldn't really use her.
1429218	1430399	You just would be happy she's there.
1431140	1436364	There was basically a whole side quest where if you use a game, it basically is edited out code is what it is.
1436384	1438486	You can run through this quest where you pick up all the stuff.
1438846	1441548	Then you go back into the church and you see her there.
1441568	1444791	Actually, on the American version, you see her there, but when you walk forward, she just disappears.
1445371	1446372	That's actually bad coding.
1447353	1447693	Weird.
1448273	1448654	Yeah.
1448834	1449975	The whole quest is on the Japanese one.
1450235	1450395	Weird.
1451107	1452228	Final Fantasy VII Remakes
1482020	1485162	I can actually say this because I am female.
1485182	1485643	Stupid women drivers!
1485663	1488965	Okay, I'm getting back on the freeway after stopping at a truck stop.
1510683	1532263	and I'm changing lanes and I signal and get into my lane and start to accelerate and this other woman and her children some type of breeder cow lady was behind a semi and then cuts me off to get in front of me and then she's like finally I just got her out of my way shot past her couldn't deal with that but like she almost clipped the front of my car and then another stupid lady on the way home
1533015	1539457	In an SUV, ha ha ha, decides that she's going to tailgate me for 10 minutes.
1539917	1540897	And I mean literally.
1541658	1542598	I even put on my brakes.
1542638	1544558	She almost bumped me.
1544598	1545159	It was crazy.
1545519	1546699	And then she just shoots past me.
1546739	1548200	So finally I said, screw it.
1548260	1549140	Nobody else is on the road.
1549500	1551601	I got in front of her and speed matched a semi.
1552701	1553661	She turned on her brights.
1553981	1556142	Now keep in mind, she's in an SUV.
1556262	1557042	I drive a Lancer.
1557602	1559663	I am under her lights and I'm short.
1560837	1562698	I didn't care, plus I have tinted windows.
1563518	1566360	Do you think that her bright lights are really gonna mean a damn thing to me?
1566460	1567080	You're a bitch.
1567440	1570342	So, I timed it for exactly 20 minutes.
1570462	1571442	I speed matched a semi.
1572983	1573703	And then I drove up.
1573763	1574183	Wow.
1574524	1575444	And then she tried to pass me.
1577065	1578145	And then I caught up with her again.
1579066	1580226	And speed matched another semi.
1581087	1581587	For 10 minutes.
1583228	1583889	and then kept going.
1584109	1586510	There's a special place in hell for people like you.
1587331	1587892	I'm sorry.
1588192	1590493	You don't tailgate people on the freeway.
1590553	1591694	First of all, it's dangerous.
1591975	1592835	Oh, and you know what?
1592855	1594036	She was also on her cell phone.
1595357	1596858	She was on her damn cell phone.
1597158	1603503	Three things I hate is stupid drivers, people driving SUVs and talking on your goddamn cell phone while you're driving.
1604164	1607026	No, there is a special place in hell for people like her.
1609127	1612590	It's where they have 20 cell phones around them and none of them work.
1614042	1614963	But they're all ringing.
1616083	1618705	And they're all ringing with a singular ringtone.
1620526	1620886	Yeah.
1621887	1625169	So, I was, like, so mad.
1625229	1628531	And keep in mind, at this time, I had been on the road for ten hours.
1629091	1632993	To give you some background on this, a friend of mine who lives in San Diego for a convention got really sick.
1633393	1637156	So we drove down to meet her in Bakersfield.
1637976	1638617	And then drove back.
1638977	1640578	Which is, like, a five hour drive from here.
1640598	1641418	And then I had to drive back.
1642259	1642459	So...
1643442	1646363	It was just really... And I was driving back by myself by this point.
1646403	1650044	I was so worn out and pissed off at the world that I was like, you know what?
1650424	1652384	I'm going to take out all of my road frustrations.
1652464	1654445	And I did it in a completely safe way.
1654965	1660947	I did not do it by speeding, tailgating, or in other ways driving unsafely.
1661087	1662187	I just drove slowly.
1662967	1663948	Speed matching a semi.
1665708	1666108	Alright.
1667549	1668869	I got my revenge.
1669209	1670109	Power to me.
1670569	1671710	We gotta keep it moving.
1672150	1672610	Loki...
1674170	1676011	I don't know how I can really follow that.
1676071	1676531	I know.
1676711	1679052	She touched all the key points about women drivers.
1679732	1681733	I, however, am an excellent driver.
1682833	1688975	Yes, because, you know, pacing cars and, you know, getting revenge against drivers is safe driving.
1689956	1691016	I was driving safely.
1691836	1692617	I didn't speed.
1693477	1694457	She just couldn't get around me.
1695778	1696498	She was speeding.
1696558	1697598	She was doing 100.
1698819	1700079	I was saving everybody else.
1700399	1701060	Alright, kids.
1701080	1701520	Stop fighting.
1701600	1701800	Anyways.
1702290	1706072	Anyways, I don't really have an FQ of the week, but I'd like to point out an observation.
1706412	1708493	So I went to the drag races this weekend.
1709053	1711634	My God, a lot of rednecks like drag racing.
1711694	1717796	I mean, I swear to God, about half the people there didn't have shirts on, had tattoos, and drinking their beer with their kids.
1718056	1718837	But you know what, though?
1720357	1721418	Jet cars are awesome.
1722018	1723198	And that makes it worth it.
1723538	1725079	It appeals to the redneck in me.
1725379	1727460	Watching a car go 260 miles an hour down, you know, a quarter mile.
1733452	1737434	My FU of the week goes to Light Rail and some of the people that ride it.
1737954	1742837	I had jury duty this week, which I had for the past two and a half weeks, which finally ended this week.
1742897	1743337	Thank you.
1743417	1743897	It's over.
1744518	1746018	It's an important civic duty, though.
1746619	1755603	If you're in America, if it's not going to disrupt your schedule, you're not in school or whatever, and your work will compensate for you being there, I say go.
1755963	1761566	It's a really great educational experience, but don't ride the Light Rail to the courthouse because there are some
1762085	1763785	Just rude people that write it.
1764146	1764906	Oh, my gosh.
1765366	1766226	And scully people.
1766486	1767366	Yeah, all of it.
1767906	1768227	All of it.
1768267	1769187	So, F you to Light Rail.
1769347	1771187	Actually, if I may, Rob, do you have an addendum?
1771687	1771907	Sure.
1772107	1774688	I did actually speed up when I saw somebody else's lights behind her.
1775048	1775468	Oh, okay.
1777829	1778149	All right.
1779349	1781730	Is chat room giving you a little crap for your story, DarkSakura?
1781750	1782070	I don't know.
1782170	1783350	I saw some folks cheering you on.
1783370	1784391	I'm getting kudos so far.
1784651	1786031	I saw some folks cheering you on there.
1786631	1786971	All right.
1787291	1790352	I just want to say I was only punishing her and nobody else.
1791188	1797812	Loki, we had a story on backwards compatibility earlier and you have somewhat of a footnote to that story.
1798053	1798313	Yes.
1799774	1805837	A certain someone named Tim Schafer is a little pissed off that his game Psychonauts isn't backwards compatible on the 360.
1807625	1820509	He's basically offered up to fly down his team to help make it happen, but Microsoft assured him, as well as everybody else, that they're on top of it.
1820549	1829032	They've got their top men on the job, so he's not too happy about that, as well as fans of Psychonauts.
1829072	1832293	Will you be seeing Psychonauts on 360 anytime soon?
1833474	1834394	Maybe, but probably not.
1837150	1839911	Maybe in the next update, which at the going rate will be in about four months.
1841072	1841812	About, maybe.
1843833	1846594	As long as they get Krusty Demons to work on there, because that looks funny.
1847294	1852276	Wait, BMX XXX was censored on the Xbox.
1852396	1852976	I have no idea.
1853156	1854497	What system did we play it on?
1854517	1856197	Because you used to have it with GameCube.
1856617	1857858	That's kind of a weird system.
1857898	1861519	My sister and her boyfriend are borrowing it indefinitely.
1861539	1862180	Oh, fun, fun.
1863905	1869947	DarkSakura, there was a movie at the box office, or a movie that did pretty well at the box office this week, and maybe it'll be a game now?
1870748	1871348	You know what?
1872188	1880091	And actually, I haven't been to see it, I really want to, but Nacho Libre has been licensed by Majesco.
1881732	1883272	What has Majesco done lately?
1885893	1888134	I'm not sure, to be honest.
1888214	1893276	Maybe their Wikipedia would clue us into that, I'm assuming, because Wikipedia has all this useless stuff on it.
1893783	1897944	Well, basically the game's going to be done by Budcat Creations.
1898004	1901866	They brought out Psychonauts and Madden NFL 2006.
1904366	1908728	But this is going to be, from what I'm seeing, it's going to be on the Nintendo DS.
1910008	1913929	It's going to be the first Nintendo DS game on the US and European market.
1914970	1916290	So we will have Nacho Libre!
1917570	1918731	And there's also a mention that...
1920134	1925608	They're trying to obtain the right to the Ghost Rider movie, but I think Take-Two got it instead.
1927337	1930280	I played that Ghost Rider game at E3 and it got awful.
1930300	1931581	They should have given it to somebody else.
1931661	1932802	I'm sorry, it was awful.
1933122	1935624	Speaking of games and movies, I completely forgot.
1936184	1943370	Silent Hill, the movie, is actually coming to DVD August 22nd in the United States, so look forward to that.
1943890	1951476	They're going to have some DVD commentaries on there, plus the origins of Silent Hill and some other stuff.
1951576	1952637	No UFO ending!
1952937	1955439	It better have a UFO ending as an Easter egg.
1955499	1956060	Or the dog.
1957324	1959345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1987808	1989569	I am a big fan of Mexican wrestling.
2006984	2010986	We've had a lot of politically oriented stories in the first half of the show, and this kind of follows that.
2011026	2016769	The ESRB is now threatening $1 million game rating fines.
2017330	2018010	$1 million!
2018230	2019291	$1 million!
2019351	2026795	The ESRB is raising this maximum penalty for a publisher who fails to disclose objectionable content.
2027235	2030337	So don't leave your nudity on the disc.
2031041	2034603	because some hacker might find it and your company is going to get sued for one million.
2034683	2035583	Here's my question though.
2035724	2038145	I know how they have their rating system and stuff.
2038605	2049211	Now, I for a fact know that anime, like ADV for example, they do not have ratings that are done by the MPAA.
2049351	2057435	They have their own ratings that they put on there that are completely independent and yet they are sold in stores out there.
2057455	2058416	They're not betting them.
2059196	2061557	Who gives a crap if they get sued a million dollars?
2061617	2065938	Couldn't they self-rate their games and still be able to put them out in the store?
2065998	2070859	Well, I was going to get to that, is that the ESRB, you know, you might be asking, well, what happens if they don't pay the one million dollars?
2070879	2081642	Well, what the ESRB can do is revoke the rating services, and that will screw you when it comes to getting into Walmart and GameStop and all that stuff, which doesn't carry games that aren't branded.
2083242	2085403	Or have the AO rating, I should point out.
2086134	2097016	I don't know, you raise a good point, but at the same time with the video games getting all this negative publicity in the sense of these laws, I don't know if a video game company would be able to get away with it the same way a movie company can.
2098156	2100156	I don't see, I mean, because they're rated.
2100256	2105357	Anime is kind of its own, in the sense of movies, it's kind of its own specialty world anyway.
2105477	2109038	Yeah, but the ESRB is like kind of an independent company anyways.
2109458	2115099	Why do they have to be, you know, the one out there that says what the game is rated?
2115526	2117727	Couldn't there be another rating system out there?
2117947	2120109	Does it really need to be this one company?
2120449	2124311	I mean, if you think about it, they're putting these companies through a lot of stupid shit.
2124571	2127333	I mean, the whole hot coffee thing was ridiculous to begin with.
2127693	2130095	And the fact that they're threatening $1 million fines.
2130115	2131275	$1 million for what?
2131956	2134037	Oh, that's going to teach them what?
2134377	2135418	To not go with you?
2135498	2135958	Big deal.
2136078	2137479	I mean, it's an independent company.
2137519	2138900	I don't see what the big deal is.
2139040	2140921	Just self-rate your games.
2141551	2144313	That's what we did before we even had these ESRB things.
2144574	2146995	It either didn't have a rating or they were self-rated.
2147075	2148917	So, big deal.
2149097	2149517	I don't know.
2152460	2154581	Loki, take us to our next story.
2155022	2158685	Speaking of craziness, I swear to God it should be a segment on this show.
2158825	2161707	What crazy thing did Sony say this week?
2162287	2167752	Well, Kutaragi, he came out and said...
2169208	2177112	As the PlayStation 3 is a computer, we might even offer it on a build-to-order basis, customized to the needs of each and every user.
2178833	2179753	Congratulations.
2179953	2180714	You are retarded.
2181314	2183475	So like a gateway PlayStation 3?
2183515	2185816	So it's like a PC?
2185936	2186897	A gate station?
2187437	2188758	Dude, you're getting a PS3.
2188798	2189098	Great.
2190859	2191779	It's a PC.
2192339	2192900	Wonderful.
2194841	2196441	Sony seems to really be working that.
2196521	2197542	It's a computer angle.
2198234	2200075	All that to avoid taxes in the UK.
2200095	2202157	I don't know.
2202697	2204218	They don't get it.
2204459	2207581	Speaking of people in power at companies, did you hear this?
2207621	2211263	This doesn't maybe directly affect gaming, but it is important to note.
2211864	2218208	Nerds everywhere were noting that Bill Gates has announced that he's stepping down from his head position at Microsoft in 2008.
2219700	2221381	and what's going to happen after July of 2008.
2222161	2225402	Gates will kind of function only in like an advisory role.
2225762	2227763	He's not going to really be doing the day-to-day functions.
2227803	2229024	He'll just sit back and make money on it.
2229124	2234086	Well, he wants to focus on the charity stuff, which is cool, and it's got him a lot of notoriety in recent years, right?
2234126	2235887	Wasn't he People of the Year?
2236407	2238588	Was it last year or the year before with his wife and Bono?
2239048	2239168	Yeah.
2239188	2239908	For their charity work?
2239968	2242569	I'm surprised he's being able to retire in two years.
2242609	2244470	I mean, isn't he going to go broke like tomorrow?
2245718	2246859	I somehow doubt that.
2247260	2249362	With all the billions of dollars that he's making.
2250283	2251745	He's going to be really struggling.
2251785	2253227	He might have to cut back.
2257157	2262701	Expect to see Ray Ozzie, who is the Chief Technical Officer, start to kind of take on a bigger role there.
2263442	2274591	Not saying he's necessarily going to be a replacement, but he's going to assume the title of Chief Software Architect and work side-by-side with Gates on technical architecture and product oversight responsibilities.
2274991	2280235	So you might start seeing some of those other folks there at Microsoft starting to fill the shoes of Bill Gates.
2281836	2285599	One person whose shoes cannot be filled is the great and terrible Dark Sakura.
2286482	2288884	DarkSakura, who's emailing us this week?
2314850	2317553	Well, tonight I actually just have three emails.
2318153	2326461	Yeah, because I got one that wasn't really a particularly appropriate question, and then a few others that were just sight suggestions.
2326721	2330084	By the way, thank you to our friend Rob with two Bs.
2330244	2334148	So, we have our first email comes from Matt in the UK.
2335809	2336450	He's really awesome.
2337102	2338703	I just want to say that your show is awesome.
2338823	2342684	I just wish that I lived in a different time zone so I can listen to your shows live.
2343104	2344445	I listen to your podcasts all the time.
2344545	2347666	I always learn something new when I listen to OLR and you guys always make me laugh.
2348326	2348706	Thank you.
2349627	2352107	I wonder if you've ever thought of coming down to the UK sometime.
2352668	2354969	There's the odd convention going on here and there.
2355069	2358770	If you do come down here sometime, it would make me the happiest pretty on the aisle.
2359468	2362070	Your show is amazing and I hope you carry on for many years to come.
2374941	2375861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2392118	2398763	If we do SakuraCon next year, which I'm understanding we've already been approved guests or whatever, we're going to have to pay for that to go there.
2398783	2403246	We'll be driving our way to Washington.
2403466	2407089	If you want to help us out with plane money, sure we'll come.
2407563	2409003	I'd love to check out the UK.
2409043	2409884	I've always wanted to go there.
2409904	2411764	We should start to send Orange Lounge to Britain.
2411824	2413325	Well, we'll see.
2413385	2413745	We'll see.
2414325	2415926	So someday.
2416026	2416906	Don't count it out.
2417226	2420067	I mean, I still want to go there to travel, so I will pay for it someday.
2420127	2424188	It's just hopefully Orange Lounge Radio is still around next year and years.
2424228	2426769	Well, I know it will be, but, you know, when I can afford it.
2427890	2432391	Well, I got actually a non-story email from Rob.
2433687	2443194	This is just an idea I have, but if Pin Mame and Wii use the Wii-type control scheme, realistic nudges could be modeled for the first time on a home game in those virtual tables that you talked about last week.
2443794	2446916	Of course, nothing comes close to a full-thrust nudge on a table with no tilt.
2448097	2449658	Well, I don't think it's got to be Pin Mame.
2449678	2452540	I think any pinball simulator on the Wii could incorporate that idea.
2452560	2453421	That's a dang good idea.
2455082	2460546	And then we also have one from, I think, another map.
2461813	2474465	I just wanted to let you know that on www.abtelectronics.com they have the PS3 available for pre-order.
2475006	2476567	The only thing is that you can't really pre-order it.
2477108	2481572	Instead of the add to cart button it is replaced with an authorized button which takes you to nowhere.
2481792	2482613	You should check it out.
2482773	2485816	Go to the website and click on video game consoles under video games tab.
2486743	2490546	I'm sorry, buddy, but I've never heard of that site, and I would never buy a system from a site.
2490566	2492887	I've never dropped $600 on a site I've never heard of.
2493308	2503114	But you give a good chance for us to bring up this opportunity to say, don't buy from places that you don't have a trust in.
2503194	2508378	I don't know this company, so I'm not trying to knock it, but I've never heard of it.
2509439	2514202	Whenever you get anything like that, your best friend for any internet ordering place is...
2515268	2517489	and the Better Business Bureau website.
2518010	2520992	Check anything out before you order online.
2521172	2523393	Read their feedback or you could really be burned.
2524834	2527736	And just make sure that you do your research before you go through any of those websites.
2527756	2529377	That's why I wanted to bring that email up.
2530298	2532659	Although it is funny that they're taking pre-orders that go to nowhere.
2534360	2537482	Maybe it's just something they want to make and it's broken or I don't know.
2537522	2538283	It's coming soon.
2538323	2538623	Who knows?
2539223	2539503	Could be.
2539743	2540324	Under construction.
2540764	2543406	Nobody in chat room is saying anything about that site so I don't know.
2543446	2543686	We'll see.
2544906	2545347	Is that it?
2546228	2546749	That'd be all.
2546889	2548131	Alright, send us more email.
2548172	2554703	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, meanwhile, you want to be a beta tester?
2555287	2561352	Yes, if you do, then you better head on over to Atari's website.
2562452	2568997	Actually, they're doing an online beta test for the PlayStation 2 version of their new Test Drive Unlimited.
2569698	2577284	And you can go and sign up right now at www.atari.com slash TDU beta test.
2578144	2578305	And...
2579235	2580696	You can basically sign up there.
2580756	2586941	Of course, they're saying that you're going to be under a strict non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.
2587801	2588282	Standard.
2588422	2595146	You will need to have a PlayStation 2 console, including a broadband internet connection and network adapter.
2597168	2597448	Alright.
2598369	2600310	So, yeah, be sure to check that out.
2601311	2602692	I will say, though, if I am picked...
2604175	2605516	I will not bite by that indie.
2629378	2631378	Please give these guys a call first.
2631598	2632399	Echo 123.
2633799	2635559	And you don't have to add them to their friends list.
2635599	2638400	A lot of people have told me, well, I tried calling you, but they wouldn't accept my friend invite.
2638600	2639160	They're not going to.
2639200	2639820	It's a computer.
2640060	2644681	You just put that in as your call, and it'll pick up right away, and you can hear what you sound like.
2644761	2646441	So please give them a call first.
2646822	2647842	Make sure you sound good.
2647922	2648842	Then give us a call.
2648922	2650702	Otherwise, we get angry.
2651142	2654003	That'll be right after this story about the DS Lights.
2654663	2657064	on Japanese airline JAL.
2657424	2664328	They're going to be offering their first class and executive class passengers DS Lights to play during the flight's duration.
2665028	2668110	It's a special promotion that's going on until August 31st.
2668650	2671751	And if you think you have to be in Japan to use this, no.
2672131	2683497	It actually, the routes would include Tokyo, New York City, Tokyo, Chicago, Tokyo, LA, Tokyo, San Francisco, Tokyo, London, Tokyo, Beijing, and one other one, Tokyo, Guangzhou.
2684722	2686404	If I horribly butchered that, I'm sorry.
2687344	2692448	So if you have JAL going to Tokyo from where you are, chances are you'll have a chance to do this.
2693408	2701374	Of course, the DS Lite's Wi-Fi capabilities have been taken out because you're not supposed to have wireless and all that stuff interfering on the planes.
2701794	2711260	However, you will get a chance to do a Japanese brain training game, an English brain training game, Otona no DS Golf, and Mario Kart.
2711640	2713762	So no snaking on a plane?
2718921	2719581	You know what?
2720902	2723083	That's got to be one of the worst jokes ever told on this show.
2723123	2723824	Congratulations.
2724484	2725165	I'm full of them.
2725445	2726105	I'll keep them coming.
2726145	2728126	I've been borrowing from 23Megas.
2728566	2728927	Good job.
2728947	2732949	Alright, our... The roll of toilet paper is right here.
2733229	2736571	Our Skype line is open over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2736591	2738792	Click on Interact With Us or you can pick up your phone and call 916-226-9067.
2738812	2738893	But...
2741914	2741954	D.S.
2741994	2742575	Light D.S.
2742595	2742735	Light
2764505	2767406	Well, a thousand of them got stolen in Hong Kong.
2767586	2768406	I heard about this.
2768486	2772166	It's all Luminous' fault because it taught us how to move crates, remember?
2772866	2773667	Yeah, they sure did.
2774927	2776047	What do you think about that?
2776087	2779268	I mean, is that... I think it's crazy.
2779448	2780388	You think it's crazy?
2781028	2781208	Why?
2781228	2782908	Because somebody was able to get away with it?
2783028	2783668	Stealing all that?
2783728	2784248	Yeah.
2785469	2787509	Well, don't you watch 24?
2787629	2789429	Someone like Jack Bauer can do anything.
2790210	2791330	Yeah, you're right, but he's dead.
2792210	2792810	He's not dead.
2793499	2794999	If he died, the show wouldn't continue.
2795820	2796860	Well, one of the geeks died.
2796900	2797600	That made me sad.
2797640	2798660	Anyway, anyway, this is about games.
2798680	2799461	This is about games.
2799521	2800901	Anything else you want to say about DS Lite?
2801961	2803322	No, but I have a question for you.
2804042	2804382	I'm sorry?
2805042	2805902	I have a question for you.
2806142	2806482	Oh, what?
2806522	2806722	Me?
2806822	2807223	Oh, what?
2808663	2812544	What is the longest loading screen you ever encountered in a game?
2814343	2816604	of recent memory, Final Fantasy XI.
2816664	2817284	We timed it.
2817304	2821185	It takes 1 minute 59 seconds to get from boot up into the actual game.
2821625	2823425	And that may not sound like a long time, but it is.
2824186	2826526	Ultramix 3 also had a pretty horrible load time.
2826546	2828907	It takes like a minute to get in there after the title screen.
2828947	2829587	It's pretty bad.
2829807	2831367	Any of the KLF games on Saturn.
2831847	2832888	Mm-hmm.
2832948	2834408	Grand Theft Auto's got a pretty bad one.
2834448	2838429	Oblivion does too, but I can understand an Oblivion's case because once you get in there, it's pretty good.
2838649	2841970	Actually, Street Fighter Alpha on the Super Nintendo had loading time.
2842430	2842690	Mm-hmm.
2843257	2843517	Really?
2843898	2844478	Yes, it did.
2844538	2845139	It was horrible.
2845419	2854926	You'd go to the scene, and then a character would pop up after 30 seconds, and then another character would pop up, and then the voice would load in, and then it would start.
2855246	2856728	Our chat room's taking an opportunity.
2856788	2857268	One more thing.
2857368	2857728	Oh, sure.
2858749	2864234	I have a custom-built Super Nintendo controller that is custom-made for a computer.
2865114	2865755	Where'd you get this?
2865775	2866956	Is this something you did yourself?
2867776	2868657	I ordered it.
2869217	2869458	Huh?
2870058	2872040	I ordered it online on eBay.
2872280	2872360	Oh.
2872898	2873378	How's it work?
2874259	2874659	Great.
2874839	2875559	Works perfectly.
2876339	2879100	Is it just using a bunch of different converters?
2879121	2884583	No, it's a Super Nintendo controller that is USB interface and it works great with all emulators.
2884703	2885603	And you got this on eBay?
2886363	2886784	On eBay.
2886924	2887964	Do you remember the seller's name?
2888204	2889165	So you can recommend it?
2889825	2892086	No, I don't know the website.
2892146	2893366	This guy makes all of them.
2893386	2895067	He even made a Power Glove.
2896192	2896933	ComputerOne.
2897153	2897453	Wow.
2897533	2904138	Well, do you remember, though, the people who made the PC out of the Nintendo?
2906299	2908300	I remember someone did an Atari one.
2908721	2920329	Well, the site's gone now, but he was actually building them for people and selling, and he was making the controller into a USB and also converting the Super Nintendo mouse into a PC mouse.
2921883	2923123	Oh yeah, they do have that on.
2923284	2924104	I did see that.
2924604	2925224	The mouse one.
2925244	2925884	I want to buy it.
2926705	2927685	It was like $24.
2928045	2929866	But he was building it basically out of laptop parts.
2930486	2934787	And just putting a USB connector instead of the regular plug-in.
2935388	2936368	And setting up drivers for it.
2939321	2943982	RavensDolphin, I want to point out as well, the chat room is giving quite a response to your question about load times.
2944022	2946644	HitStun saying, Half-Life 2 takes me forever to load.
2947004	2951505	YouWillBowToMe says, MidnightClubDub for PSP has hella load times.
2952206	2952866	Yeah, I agree.
2953026	2957208	XanderK says, The Sims 2 for PSP has the crappiest loads ever.
2958708	2961129	Wow, I didn't expect such a response to this.
2961550	2962690	It was just a random question.
2963290	2965331	See how easy it is to get a response out of people?
2965391	2967152	Just get on a microphone and start yelling.
2968444	2970646	All right, I know you got a bunch of calls, so I'm going to let it go.
2970686	2971547	Yeah, we got a couple.
2971607	2972968	All right, have a good one, Ravenstolphin.
2972988	2973588	Thanks for the call.
2973889	2974149	Later.
2976070	2976911	Let's go to another call.
2977872	2979313	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2979353	2979833	Who's this?
2980774	2981515	It's Diginova.
2981955	2982896	Hi, Diginova.
2983477	2984177	Hey, how you doing?
2984197	2985879	Just let you know it's sunrise here at the moment.
2985979	2986519	Oh, my God.
2986539	2987720	What time is it over there?
2988541	2989882	It's 4.30 in the morning.
2990002	2992404	I can tell where you're from from the sound of your voice.
2992444	2993965	That's, wow, mightily.
2993985	2994606	You sound tired.
2995960	3002763	Well, I was going to go to bed at midnight, but I asked my fiancé, could I please just stay up and listen to you guys because I've got the time off because I've just changed jobs.
3003204	3004404	Well, thank your fiancé for us.
3004764	3006805	And thank you for being so dedicated.
3006845	3007566	You're crazy.
3007626	3008066	I love it.
3008486	3009026	What's on your mind?
3009046	3010087	What do you want to share with listeners?
3011127	3012228	It was actually two points.
3012248	3014509	First of all, I'll make it quick because I know you guys got other people calling.
3014669	3019531	It was, I was watching the TV show called Gamer TV.
3019571	3020432	It's here in Bravo.
3020452	3022673	It's a Sky thing, Rupert Murdoch thing anyway.
3023115	3024556	I want to say we get that over here.
3024576	3027117	Didn't they used to show that on a G4 at some point?
3027277	3028038	Gamer TV?
3028178	3028478	Yeah.
3028758	3031160	It's a different network though, but yeah.
3031540	3032601	Anyway, I'm sorry.
3032641	3032921	Go ahead.
3034342	3050631	Basically, in backing up what you were saying about games and parents and the rest, but this one in particular was about a doctor in Chicago saying games are very good and how they influence the mind and how keyhole surgery it was, I've forgotten what his name was, it's on there, but it was
3051058	3054199	Really interesting to the point of you saying how games were influencing.
3054219	3055540	I just thought I'd bring that up.
3055800	3059842	And the second point was, when the hell are they going to release OutRun for the backwards compatibility?
3059882	3062162	That was one reason why I kept my game.
3062182	3062783	Why?
3062803	3064423	I hate that guy.
3066801	3068982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3087033	3092055	I read it in a psychological journal.
3092576	3103301	I actually read a test in a psychological journal that was talking about reaction times, especially when playing puzzle games, RPGs, versus non-gamers, and that the gamer group came out way ahead.
3104101	3106582	It's too bad our politicians don't seem to be counting any of that.
3107442	3111844	Yeah, there's nothing over here in the same sort of politics way going towards gaming.
3112505	3113025	But, um...
3114944	3116345	How is it over there?
3116405	3124430	While I've got a UK listener on the phone, I can kind of ask, what is the impression over there of what is going on over here with the gaming laws?
3124590	3130334	I mean, is it we're a bunch of crazies over here in America, or is it, well, the same thing's happening over here?
3130994	3131435	and so on.
3151533	3152934	Dan's rude, but in a funny way.
3173870	3176713	I was laughing to him and saying, that's not good customer service.
3176753	3177554	You work in a bank.
3177914	3181097	There's rude, rude, and then there's rude funny.
3181337	3182358	And Dan's rude funny.
3182979	3184660	Yeah.
3184720	3186182	Somehow or another, he gets away with it.
3186282	3192247	I actually, I work for a bank myself, and there's a big difference in the level of customer, though.
3193288	3195911	Yeah, well, over here, we've got, like, it's just a local bank.
3196011	3199334	I mean, it's national, it's owned by RBS, World Bank of Scotland, but
3200131	3200792	Outrun Outrun Outrun Outrun
3218890	3247687	usually when they get one they get about like 20 because you know they weren't targeting that Barbie adventure game and I don't know how many times I've said this to people when they bitch about why is Barbie emulatable and you know Outrun isn't well because not that I'm saying this because Mattel paid for it well no because Barbie is probably very similar in it's design to I don't know Halo or one of the games that is already playable I'm not trying to say Barbie's like Halo but you know
3248511	3249154	Go back to...
3250132	3251893	8-bit and 16-bit emulation.
3251933	3252933	It's almost the same way.
3252993	3254854	For instance, the NES games.
3255314	3258135	A lot of NES games are assigned to certain mappers.
3258175	3262096	I don't want to get into too much detail, but all the NES games are on certain mappers.
3262616	3274159	And for a lot of these obscure Japanese titles, the reason why those were the last ones to be emulated on NES emulators is because their mappers were not one of the standard... I think there's like five or six standard ones.
3274800	3276140	The crazy ones are outside of that.
3276180	3278961	You would have to basically write new code for each mapper.
3279681	3282982	Take that idea and apply it to Xbox and Xbox 360.
3283322	3285283	That's kind of what's going on.
3285323	3290664	When you unlock one big game, you might unlock a bunch of little crappy ones that were similar in design.
3291125	3294025	But it's not that Xbox is targeting those crap games.
3294105	3297987	It's that it just happens that they work so it can just boost their numbers.
3298067	3298487	Yippee!
3300847	3303428	It raises the whole situation you said about PlayStation 3.
3303468	3305529	They put simply just a PlayStation in there.
3305589	3306029	Again, with the
3306647	3307268	Thanks for calling in.
3307288	3308028	Thanks for calling in.
3332409	3332929	Sleep well!
3334390	3335870	Whenever he finally goes to sleep there.
3336471	3341853	I wanted to point out here in the chatroom, BlackWolf, our buddy Bobby, over on... They're on Captain N again.
3342193	3342373	Huh?
3342633	3343733	They're on Captain N again.
3343753	3344474	No, no, no, not Bobby.
3344514	3348995	Bobby's saying, well, he might be somewhere else, but Bobby is saying that they did target Big Mother Truckers.
3351456	3351776	Why?
3352376	3354777	Because there's a certain demographic that goes for that, you know.
3354837	3357138	And they're all... I know, I know.
3357698	3358719	Let's do one more call here.
3358759	3359759	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3359779	3360139	Who's this?
3360459	3361640	It's a one and only man.
3362265	3368589	It's the one and only choppy Legend of Zaku, who's choppy, choppy in and out, who needs to turn off the porn torrents.
3368629	3369029	No, I'm kidding.
3369289	3369649	What's up?
3370610	3377254	Alright, I got word on the street that Supernova's coming out this Wednesday in Dave & Buster's in Times Square.
3377594	3382137	And for the three or four listeners we have in Times Square, they're going to be really happy.
3382797	3390562	Nah, I mean, it's been confirmed by folks who have been, who are on the inside of the company and the people that work there, so...
3391511	3396014	And since I'm 21, that's a definite of me actually going there that Wednesday.
3396154	3399075	Okay, hooray for you, but what about the rest of us?
3399716	3401096	We have listeners in New York.
3401216	3402437	Yeah, I understand that.
3402837	3407120	I understand that, but we have lots of listeners, a fraction of which live in New York.
3407420	3409361	But what I'm trying to get at, here's what I'm trying to get at.
3409381	3414964	The point is, is this going to be a trend for Dave and Buster's?
3415609	3417150	because there's lots of Dave and Buster's everywhere.
3417170	3423314	I think from what I'm hearing is that they're going to phase out their pump-it-up machines and supernovas.
3423694	3425595	Ooh, Miklatov's going to be pissed.
3426116	3427357	That's what I'm hearing right there.
3427417	3429338	They're trying to use that as a replacement.
3429458	3430979	Now the DDR's gone legit here.
3431859	3432200	Interesting.
3432760	3434081	Well, we'll see what happens.
3435010	3436590	Have fun with your Supernova.
3436630	3437531	I guess take pictures.
3437571	3438511	Send us a review.
3438591	3442452	If you want any reviews or any info, I should be able to provide it by next Sunday.
3442672	3445892	Well, I don't want to sound like a jerk, but we did kind of get to play it at E3.
3445912	3449453	This one will be the final one, though.
3449473	3450053	All right.
3450133	3451613	Well, let us know if there's anything different.
3451633	3452213	That's what I want to know.
3452233	3454794	If there's anything different from what we saw at E3, then let us know.
3455454	3455734	All right.
3455774	3456794	I'll give you back the skinny.
3457194	3457514	All right.
3457574	3458235	Zach, we got to go.
3458255	3459075	We got more calls coming in.
3459455	3459735	All right.
3459795	3460355	Have a good one, buddy.
3461415	3462955	Have fun in your Times Square.
3463135	3464436	Actually, I do love Times Square, though.
3464476	3465776	I love New York City.
3466036	3468856	If you do live there and listen to this show, you're lucky, because I do love that place.
3469376	3470377	Let's go to another phone call.
3470417	3471597	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3471617	3472037	Who's this?
3473757	3476218	Sky, I was joking about Big Mother Truckers.
3477658	3478278	Hi, Bobby.
3478458	3479038	Kidding.
3480578	3480878	You know what?
3480898	3484919	You can't say things in chat like that without putting a JK or something.
3485019	3485539	I don't know.
3486379	3487079	I put the JK.
3487139	3487740	It was silent.
3487900	3489780	It was on the internet, therefore it must be true.
3489800	3490220	Exactly.
3491656	3492256	You got me.
3496177	3498858	And for that, since you got me, I will let you pimp your show.
3498938	3499398	Go for it.
3500078	3500698	Oh, my show?
3500858	3501098	Yes.
3501318	3503198	Yeah, my show is the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
3503238	3508860	We're on allgames.com, and we talked about how table tennis does actually have a whore in it.
3509660	3510220	Jesper.
3510980	3511740	His name is Jesper.
3512500	3513081	He is a whore.
3513601	3516041	And anybody who's played table tennis knows Jesper's a big whore.
3516701	3517181	Yes, he is.
3517862	3518722	So I just wanted to clear that up.
3519022	3519562	All right, no problem.
3519582	3520062	I'll say Bobby.
3520592	3523294	Allgames.com Allgames.com Allgames.com
3548840	3550661	Say it enough times and people will go there, Bobby.
3551902	3553623	Ballgames.com All right, have a good one.
3554163	3554543	Bye, guys.
3554643	3554884	Bye.
3556825	3557425	We love Bobby.
3557465	3557945	He's so cool.
3558906	3559446	One more call.
3559486	3561988	I lied before when I said that Zaku would be last.
3562008	3562768	We're doing one more.
3562808	3563749	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3563769	3564149	Who's this?
3564709	3565630	Hi, this is Anoush.
3565890	3566530	Hi, Anoush.
3566590	3567231	What's on your mind?
3567451	3569732	Oh, I did butcher your name earlier, didn't I?
3572194	3573734	Now I know, and knowing's half the battle.
3573774	3574675	What's on your mind, Anoush?
3575515	3576336	Just a quick question.
3577329	3583594	Do you guys think that Sony is just going to surprise us all right at launch with all these games and things that no one was expecting?
3586417	3587978	Whoa, it's like the remix.
3588078	3588859	It's echoing there.
3589559	3590200	Careful, buddy.
3590220	3591320	Turn down your volume there.
3591340	3594523	I don't think so because Sony isn't very smart.
3598626	3599307	I disagree.
3599327	3602890	I think Sony has surprises left in store.
3603030	3604191	I think they have to.
3604791	3605712	I think Sony...
3607578	3610799	is going to have to do something to make up for E3.
3612640	3615461	And I don't know what that is, but it will be a surprise when it's said.
3616181	3620223	I don't see that Sony is going to leave themselves in this hole that they've dug.
3620283	3633528	What they need to do is they need to gag everybody at that company, shut the F up, do not talk about PS3 anymore, stop talking to the gaming press, and then two months before the system comes out, we will have the bang-up press conference.
3634128	3635149	We'll have a do-over...
3636358	3637859	and do it right this time.
3637919	3644785	Sorry, I'm using the internal mic for my MacBook Pro.
3645045	3645605	That's alright.
3646166	3648067	Anoush, any other thoughts on that that you want to share?
3648888	3649448	Nothing really.
3649868	3650169	Okay.
3651069	3654792	Well, thanks for the question, but I've got to hang up because the echo is driving me nuts.
3655173	3658035	I love what Xander K. said in the chat.
3658435	3659396	What did Xander K. say?
3659416	3662038	It kind of sounds like my wife's breast pump.
3662098	3662678	Gross.
3663959	3664820	It's so nasty.
3666516	3667556	That was freaky.
3669057	3670817	Skye's voice second mix from Dark Tetsuya.
3670837	3672377	That sounded scary.
3673318	3676298	Like, I don't know, like I was in Poltergeist or something.
3676338	3677939	Alright, any last minute stories?
3677959	3679119	Come into the light, Rob.
3679419	3681339	Any last minute stories here in studio?
3681440	3695123	Well, I was going to mention, since we talked about Table Tennis, that Grand Theft Auto 4 is actually going to be using Table Tennis' graphic engine called Rage, Rockstar's advanced game engine, for Grand Theft Auto 4.
3695383	3696263	So that's going to be pretty sweet.
3697529	3699650	Okay, yeah, table tennis is a good-looking game.
3699710	3701831	Let's hope it carries over into Grand Theft Auto.
3701851	3702412	I'm sure it will.
3702572	3703872	I have no doubt it'll look sexy.
3704213	3704573	I'm sure.
3705433	3706374	DarkSakura, did you have anything?
3708975	3713137	Well, there is a list out, a very special list.
3713437	3713778	Okay.
3714638	3719841	This is basically the list of games that have been released since Duke Nukem Forever was announced.
3721462	3721882	Oh, boy.
3721902	3721982	Okay.
3722656	3723317	Duke Nukem Forever
3752586	3781612	The Legend of Zelda series since Ocarina of Time a bunch of over 75 games in the Mega Man universe 12 games featuring Mega Man universe character cameos 50 games in the Star Wars universe Mario has been in 58 different games since it was announced every Thief game, every version of Counter Strike Half-Life every Tony Hawk game video game systems, the Xbox was released and all the systems since then it also lists some fun facts
3783478	3789080	In 1997, the fastest consumer internet connection was a 33.6 KBPS modem.

3795722	3798744	When Duke Nukem Forever was announced, the fastest processor was a 233 MHz Pentium.
3798764	3803525	In April 1997, there was no Google and there was no eBay.
3803565	3804605	Wait a minute.
3809420	3810120	No, there was eBay.
3810140	3810761	There was eBay.
3811021	3812822	It just was not even what it was now.
3813322	3814423	But there was no weblog.
3816864	3826408	And as far as disasters, it says there's been 125 hurricanes happened since then, 20 death toll-producing tornado outbreaks in the United States, and 50 major earthquakes in the world.
3826509	3830370	In other words, it's been a long freaking time since they announced Duke Nukem.
3830531	3834012	Britney Spears' entire musical career as a pop star took place since the announcement.
3834553	3836213	Somebody had a lot of free time on their hands.
3836233	3837054	This is fabulous.
3837094	3837494	I love it.

3856566	3858407	Blaze wants to know why this wasn't side of the week.
3860929	3864852	Because, I didn't think about it, because we wanted to do Sexy Roth and we had already decided last week.
3864952	3865352	All right.
3866232	3869935	I'm logging into eBay right now to see when I actually... It was worth a mention, most assuredly.
3870815	3872096	And I thank whoever sent it to me.
3873377	3875458	I'm logging in to see when I bought something on eBay.
3876019	3877360	I bought something on eBay.
3877440	3878421	Look at this, on my feedback.
3878461	3879802	Prompt, response, and payment.
3879842	3880862	A pleasure to do business with.
3881403	3885866	April 26, 1997 was when that feedback was left on my account.
3887507	3888267	I'm old school.
3889508	3893731	I have a feedback rating of 3, because the last time I bought something from eBay, you know when the last feedback was left? 99%.
3895808	3897289	I remember, though, I bought Super Metroid.
3897349	3897949	Oh, none of you care.
3897989	3898809	Why am I talking about it?
3898829	3899309	None of you care.
3900690	3903631	We have one more phone call because I forgot I promised this person they could be on tonight.
3903671	3904731	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3904771	3905131	Who's this?
3905791	3907052	I didn't know it was a promise.
3907092	3908052	Hey, it's DMN.
3908172	3909012	Hi, DMN.
3909052	3910293	Yeah, I remember saying something about it.
3910333	3910893	What's on your mind?
3911973	3914734	Well, I found out how to give away the Wii.
3915875	3916815	Okay, that's right.
3916835	3917835	You're giving away a Wii.
3918455	3918675	Yes.
3918896	3920096	Okay, how are you going to give away a Wii?
3921072	3924475	Well, because I'm a huge fan of interactivity, just like you guys are.
3924535	3930219	People who come, listen live in the chatroom, and argue appropriately with your discussion get points.
3930479	3932941	The more points they get, the more stuff they get.
3933382	3938205	If they win during the week, right now, actually, Funnydale's kicking everyone's ass.
3939006	3940447	They get a t-shirt from Nintendo.
3940487	3942168	So Funnydale's not just a clever name.
3942769	3944530	No.
3944971	3949314	The highest average score, you gotta do at least six of these, you get a Wii.
3950712	3951333	Wow.
3951793	3961662	So in other words, you have this completely subjective system that you just are going to just kind of pretty much give the system to whoever you think is the funniest.
3962483	3963744	Not necessarily the funniest.
3963764	3965766	Whoever brings the better arguments.
3965806	3966727	Whoever's the wittiest.
3967207	3967367	Yes.
3967407	3967787	Oh, get it?
3967828	3968929	The wittiest.
3970130	3970550	Yeah.
3970570	3970790	Get it?
3971351	3972251	Did I get points for that?
3972332	3973092	You got points.
3973252	3973753	Aw, damn it.
3976628	3983133	everybody good luck I hope it brings a lot more people into the chat room what do the hosts get out of this?
3983153	4002531	because I notice you've been rating the hosts too you guys just get points for the hell of it you guys just need to ask me and I'll get you stuff you know how that works I want a Wii if you send us a communal Wii we'll fight to the death over it that'll be Orange Lounge Battle Royale we'll tape it and put it on YouTube
4004748	4005769	It'll be on my MySpace profile.
4005789	4012814	Speaking of Nintendo stuff, they've got some new videos of Super Paper Mario on YouTube.
4013074	4013575	Sexy.
4013675	4016096	From the World Hobby Fair, and they look awesome.
4016116	4016917	Show me, show me, show me.
4017477	4018498	I know it's radio, I don't care, show me.
4018518	4020840	I haven't seen the game come through where I am yet, so.
4022601	4023041	Alright.
4023101	4024362	Have you seen the Wii yet?
4025003	4025283	No.
4025783	4026564	Oh, damn.
4026584	4026664	Damn.
4027569	4029690	October dates looking bleaker and bleaker.
4029911	4032892	From what I've heard, and don't quote me on this, it'll probably start in August.
4034013	4035974	Okay, well what does that mean if it tests in August?
4035994	4037715	Does that mean we might still see October?
4038856	4039376	I don't know.
4040837	4042718	I don't know how long the DS was in testing.
4045600	4048342	But, and even if I did, I don't think I'd be at liberty to say.
4048702	4050343	Okay, I don't want you to lose your job.
4050383	4053385	I guess I better have you be quiet.
4053685	4055826	But other than that, yeah, that's pretty much all I got.
4056287	4056387	Um...
4057833	4060054	Yeah, I'm gonna let you guys go and finish up your show.
4060315	4060655	Alright.
