[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:25,432
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 187 for this June 18th, 2006.

3
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's get right back into the news.

4
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:31,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start it off with Loki has a story about the PlayStation 3.

5
00:00:32,337 --> 00:00:34,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, don't we always have a story about the PlayStation 3?

6
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:36,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is newsworthy.

7
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:37,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, now the whole thing coming out with the PlayStation 3 is, what's it going to be like with retailers?

9
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:47,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I going to be able to get one?

10
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:49,607
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of quantities can we expect?

11
00:00:50,319 --> 00:01:06,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to Games First, they had an internal GameStop email which expressed concern over how many PS3s their chain, which is the largest chain out there, including eBay games, would have available.

12
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:16,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And a local store that would be receiving between 50 to 100 Xbox 360s at launch, and that wasn't very many, is expected to get no more than 20 PS3s.

13
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:17,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

14
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:22,463
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is true, that's going to suck.

15
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:28,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, it's not going to matter because people won't be buying them.

16
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:29,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be a jerk.

17
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:36,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be the anti-Sony guy because I'm really trying to give everybody a fair shot here, even if I'm being constantly disappointed over there.

18
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:41,257
[SPEAKER_03]: But, is it realistic that there's going to be as many people that want the PlayStation 3 as one at Xbox 360?

19
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:41,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

20
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:42,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.

21
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:45,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there will be a lot of people wanting it, but...

22
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:46,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

23
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:52,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It will still be a clusterfuck like the 360 launch was, I think.

24
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:59,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they're going to be having trouble selling those 20 units.

25
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I think it's going to be a problem, though.

26
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:05,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But are those 20 units just going to end up on Craigslist, eBay, etc.?

27
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:06,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they will.

28
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:07,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

29
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:09,707
[SPEAKER_02]: People learned that they can do that.

30
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:10,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad, sad, sad.

31
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:10,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Any way that we can dodge this?

33
00:02:17,142 --> 00:02:24,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this just brace yourselves, get your pre-orders in ASAP as soon as they'll start taking them or have a game plan if you really want this?

34
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:25,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much, yeah.

35
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:26,468
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, heads up.

36
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:28,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you learned from the Xbox 360 experience.

37
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to a completely different topic.

38
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:39,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it does have to do with the next generation of gaming, but it's an old game, very, very old game, making its way into the next generation of gaming.

39
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:40,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Jamie?

40
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,418
[SPEAKER_09]: This makes my heart happy.

41
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:44,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon's Lair, Sega CD, Arcade Emulator

42
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:57,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it on our two copies on DVD.

43
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:59,586
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about the game that you love so much?

44
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:04,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Because honestly, if you just memorize the... That doesn't matter.

45
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:05,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Don Bluth animation.

46
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:06,510
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so cool.

47
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,691
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's neat watching all the different ways he turns into a skeleton and dies.

48
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:13,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And on top of that, it's just really fun.

49
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So Digital Leisure is bringing it out in high definition for the PC.

50
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for the PC.

51
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:26,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, which means that I'm basically going to be hooking it up through my laptop to our 50-inch widescreen and playing the hell out of it.

52
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:27,735
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be kind of cool.

53
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:30,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So imagine how that's going to look on my TV.

54
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:31,217
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait a minute.

55
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:34,179
[SPEAKER_03]: These cartoons were made in 83 or something, right?

56
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,479
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still awesome.

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really going to look that much different in HD?

58
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:38,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what are they going to do?

59
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to redo it or anything?

60
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:45,825
[SPEAKER_09]: They're basically taking the original footage from what I understand and redoing it for high definition.

61
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:46,866
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be cool.

62
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

63
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:52,210
[SPEAKER_09]: But imagine, when it first came out, it was on Laserdisc.

64
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:57,775
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was the cleanest thing out there in the 80s as far as its resolution.

65
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:02,839
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cleaner than almost anything that you'd get at your house for any type of animation.

66
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,924
[SPEAKER_09]: So by that respect, I'm actually pretty excited about this.

67
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:11,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And also they're going to be following up with Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.

68
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:13,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Time warp!

69
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,310
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

70
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting thought there from Xander K in our chatroom.

71
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon's Lair for Xbox Live Arcade, Xander says.

72
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:21,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

73
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:22,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a little big.

74
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,361
[SPEAKER_03]: A little big.

75
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:24,903
[SPEAKER_09]: XBOX ARCADE GAME

76
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,558
[SPEAKER_02]: probably, what, 40, 50 megs?

77
00:04:55,958 --> 00:05:02,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 50 megs because they have to keep it under the size of the memory card.

78
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:12,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So, a 700 meg game versus, and that's also not counting, we have to include audio with that.

79
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:18,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure compression technology is a lot better now than it was then, but still, keep that in mind.

80
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about full solid animation.

81
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt that it's going to

82
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:28,176
[SPEAKER_09]: really be able to pull out well, at least and maintain proper resolution.

83
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:38,004
[SPEAKER_03]: GS191 in our chatroom, orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat, says Sky, they're going back to old 30s and 40s movies and remastering them in HD and they look damn good to boot.

84
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:44,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have seen some of the old movies on the HD channels we have here and they look pretty good.

85
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:47,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they still look dated, but okay, I'm willing to give it a fair shot.

86
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Dragon's Lair.

87
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:54,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a neat, I just love the concept and it's a very unique type of game.

88
00:05:55,077 --> 00:06:03,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Also in the next few weeks, keep your eye on our stuff at stuff.orangechallengeradio.com, our blog, for a review.

89
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, someone's getting the hookup.

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone is.

91
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

92
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, also our chat room brings up, I want to say it was VX, JasonXV, Dark Knight, somebody over there was talking about Space Ace.

93
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we get success with Dragon's Lair.

94
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:16,282
[SPEAKER_09]: They did Space Ace.

95
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:18,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're going to do Space Ace HD and all that good stuff?

96
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,703
[SPEAKER_09]: They said it.

97
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:23,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the next one out should be Space Ace, and let me double check it once more.

98
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Next Out Space, AceHD, and Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp

99
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:56,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of taking old games and making them new all over again, the Xbox 360 got a backwards compatibility update this week, and 21 new games are playable.

100
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:02,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 7 more in Japan, so you get 28 if you're Japan.

101
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But 21 new games are now playable.

102
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Amp 2, Doom 3, Fatal Frame, Silent Hill 4, LEGO Star Wars, Minority Report...

103
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:19,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider-Man, Spawn Armageddon, Star Wars Battlefront, The Punisher, just to name a few on the list there.

104
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:22,276
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see the full list, head on over to Xbox.com.

105
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:24,258
[SPEAKER_03]: They've updated their backwards compatibility list.

106
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:28,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I did pop in my copy of Silent Hill 4 The Room just to kind of check out, see what it looked like.

107
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked really clean.

108
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it does look better than it does on the Xbox.

109
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is about it.

110
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the software is uprising it or something, but...

111
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:37,509
[SPEAKER_03]: The game looked pretty nice.

112
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:45,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look 360 game quality, but it's definitely a little bitty baby step up from the Xbox, so I was pretty impressed.

113
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:53,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kind of sad, though, that still it's not... Most of my collection I still cannot play on the 360.

114
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:55,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of it I still can't play.

115
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:57,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hmm.

116
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:58,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

117
00:07:59,144 --> 00:07:59,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

118
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:01,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how long it'll take before we can play more of them.

119
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:02,306
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

120
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:03,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they're going to keep going?

121
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:06,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Peter Moore took back what he had said last week and all that stuff.

122
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:15,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they're going to go back and really take an effort to make all or at least all of the top 100 best-selling games playable?

123
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:28,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think this is something that slowly is going to phase out and Microsoft's just going to try and give us new stuff to make us forget about this whole mistake of not having these

124
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Backwards Compatibility Games Sooner

125
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not, so I don't care.

126
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:01,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but, I don't know.

127
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:02,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

128
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:03,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they have to patch them all at once.

129
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:03,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

130
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

131
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:08,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Microsoft's making a lot of interesting statements this week.

132
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:09,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Loki?

133
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorta, yeah.

134
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:15,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's somebody on their development staff.

135
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:27,943
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, Microsoft's Matt Lee, a developer in Microsoft's game technology group, said, and I quote, Japan's not necessarily the most important market for gaming these days.

136
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:33,605
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also not quite as large as the US and European markets.

137
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:35,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That's hilarious.

138
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:43,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody out there... Well, Nintendo's doing a good job of not saying anything.

139
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:51,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that unless you're the PR guy at Microsoft or you're the PR guy over at Sony...

140
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:58,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You should probably shut the hell up about everything because you're just digging yourself into a hole.

141
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Stock prices, not that important.

142
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:28,476
[SPEAKER_02]: What's important is what color our consoles come in.

143
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:30,838
[SPEAKER_02]: That's damn important.

144
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, DarkSakura, what do you think about that statement?

145
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:39,266
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole Japan is not that important.

146
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,248
[SPEAKER_09]: That's utter crap.

147
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:42,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, think about it.

148
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:54,389
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just a big market for the fact that there are people who stand in line for new releases of games who basically are stalkerish over voice actors for games.

149
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,791
[SPEAKER_09]: We're importing games from there because they're better than what we have here.

150
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:05,696
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just complete and utter crap to say that the market is just not as important as the fact that they are not properly catering to that market.

151
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:17,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that we might have a biased perspective being that the background on this program, we've always kind of been fans kind of geared towards that Japanese import audience or kind of more of the games we play.

152
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:22,999
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the bigger picture... I'm referring over just to the social side that games have.

153
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:30,446
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I look at our, you know, the fan base for a lot of these games is a lot bigger than...

154
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:40,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, of course, it is here, because here, to us, it's niche, but to a lot of the fandom groups there, there's a lot bigger crowd, I think.

155
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:45,851
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got those people that are going to stand in line for a new RPG.

156
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Where we have the Madden crowds are just a few people at a time, pretty much.

157
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,061
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be a busier sales day, but you don't have people just hanging out in lines outside of stores.

158
00:11:56,661 --> 00:12:00,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Or going to meet so-and-so voice actor who was in this game.

159
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:01,862
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't happen here.

160
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Games are a lot.

161
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:07,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just the fact that there's a big market for it.

162
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big social thing, too.

163
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:11,284
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot bigger than it is here.

164
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:12,084
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just in general.

165
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:16,927
[SPEAKER_09]: For us it's niche, over there it's a lot bigger.

166
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:19,364
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP Unit, AC Adapter, Battery Pack, 32MB Card

167
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: and LocoRoco.

168
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all packaged together in a special box and it comes out July 13th for 24,800 yen.

169
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Also has a special LocoRoco case that goes with it.

170
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:57,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the special Katamari case.

171
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,484
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

172
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:00,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool?

173
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:00,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Worth importing?

174
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess you already have a PSP so maybe not.

175
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:07,826
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool, I mean, but honestly I've already got a PSP.

176
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:09,726
[SPEAKER_09]: I just care about the game.

177
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:12,376
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still kind of neat, though.

178
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:15,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And I already have a cool case running, because Dan got me the one that came out with me and my Katamari.

179
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:17,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I don't have.

180
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:21,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for those of you guys that love to import things, maybe there'll be something there.

181
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, DarkS... Oh, yeah?

182
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:28,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like getting all the stuff that came with Poppin' Music 11, getting teacups and towels.

183
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,180
[SPEAKER_03]: They got some crazy collector editions in Japan.

184
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what I have.

185
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:40,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I have, on Dreamcast, I have the Cardcaptor Sakura game that came with a pillowcase, a plate, a spoon, a fork, and a clock.

186
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:41,806
[SPEAKER_09]: A wall clock.

187
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:45,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

188
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:47,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And would you actually use any of that stuff?

189
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:48,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it just collector stuff?

190
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:49,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's collector stuff.

191
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I might put the clock up when we make my art room.

192
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:53,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

193
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:55,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I love my Cardcaptor Sakura clock.

194
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, take us to our next story.

195
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,001
[SPEAKER_09]: A bunch of stuff happened.

196
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:01,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, actually, yeah.

197
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:02,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Very descriptive, thank you.

198
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:09,369
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an article for the Question of the Week on Gamasutra about...

199
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:17,928
[SPEAKER_09]: In an interview with Chris Crawford, basically, he was the creator of Balance of Power.

200
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:22,351
[SPEAKER_09]: He was basically saying new ideas don't go anywhere, so the industry is just rehashing the same stuff over and over again.

201
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:29,236
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing inherently wrong with recycling the same thing over and over and over, but how do you know what you're missing if you're not trying?

202
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:31,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anyone noticed that we don't appeal to the general public?

203
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:32,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a quote from him.

204
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:40,296
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a new question now that's on their question of the week page, and I'll get a link to that momentarily.

205
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:53,183
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's, what examples of innovation in design business or other areas do you think disprove the notion that the game industry is not evolving as quickly as it should be, or is Chris Crawford right?

206
00:14:53,743 --> 00:15:01,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's actually pretty interesting, I think, being that I've always thought that innovation needs to happen in games.

207
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we need to be seeing more of that.

208
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:16,013
[SPEAKER_09]: So the actual article, if you go onto Gamasutra's website, it's got a pretty big URL.

209
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Just look for the June 14th story.

210
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:18,554
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be a link to that.

211
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:25,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would actually really like to see some of our people, some of our listeners, I should say, respond to that.

212
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually curious myself.

213
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, send us an email to

214
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:35,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orangejonesradio.com because I'd actually like to air some of the same responses here on the show too.

215
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see.

216
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,043
[SPEAKER_03]: More to come then on that.

217
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:38,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

218
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:39,323
[SPEAKER_03]: All the feedback thing.

219
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,344
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's a pretty good question.

220
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:44,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see if there's any response there in our chat room.

221
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:46,646
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still all over at orangejonesradio.com.

222
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

223
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:51,709
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still all consumed there with the Cardcaptor Sakura pack that you have there.

224
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:54,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll put pictures of it up on our site.

225
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, DarkTetsuya says, here's a comment relating to that.

226
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, well, what's more innovative than the Wii?

227
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

228
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:06,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii is getting a lot of brownie points for being innovative.

229
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,303
[SPEAKER_03]: A very innovative system.

230
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:10,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I say you write that down.

231
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Send that in, DarkTetsuya.

232
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:14,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

233
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:15,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

234
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:17,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

235
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:19,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the Wii, what's Nintendo up to?

236
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:30,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Nintendo has a new Club Nintendo, which is, I guess, a brand new website that they're launching that you can get a ton of really exclusive...

237
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo stuff.

238
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything they've got.

239
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:39,860
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, some different notebooks.

240
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:40,642
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get tape

241
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Animal Crossing characters on it.

242
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:51,306
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got these folders that have Mario stuff on there.

243
00:16:52,026 --> 00:17:01,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my favorites, they have a DS case that holds nine different styluses, all different colors of the rainbow, and nine games that's available.

244
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:05,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Also some multicolored DS Lite cases.

245
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:12,475
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a Mario, kind of like a bookshelf for your Nintendo DS games.

246
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:25,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And then probably the best thing out of all of them on there, an exclusive Nintendo DS game, the Game & Watch Collection, where you can play Game & Watch games on your DS.

247
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:26,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy!

248
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Allow me to be the first to say, Game & Watch games sucked.

249
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:29,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I want this?

250
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Game & Watch!

251
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of nostalgia value.

252
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:35,948
[SPEAKER_03]: They totally kicked the ass of Tiger Toys.

253
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

254
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

255
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,150
[SPEAKER_02]: For Japan only, unfortunately.

256
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,992
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're wanting to check it out, it's... Ah, you know that shit will show up on eBay.

257
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:50,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Club.nintendo.jp slash new underscore present.

258
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go.

259
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:58,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on to another story.

260
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:01,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the Wii as well, DarkSakura has a story relating to the Wii.

261
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:02,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I sure do.

262
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So, who's a fan of Call of Duty 3?

263
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:06,980
[SPEAKER_09]: All five people?

264
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,740
[SPEAKER_09]: No, kidding.

265
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hugely successful game.

266
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:10,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not in this room.

267
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I love Call of Duty.

268
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest, never played it.

269
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:19,766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not my... One out of three Orangels most agree Call of Duty is top notch.

270
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

271
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so burned out on the War Sim.

272
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:24,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not my kind of thing.

273
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:26,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you should borrow mine.

274
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:27,390
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just not my kind of thing.

275
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, I will borrow it and give it a chance, but it's just not really my kind of game.

276
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I got plenty of other crap to play.

277
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:36,962
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got details for Call of... I said Tooties.

278
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:39,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got details for Call of Duty.

279
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:39,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Call of Duty.

280
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:40,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Call of Booty.

281
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,849
[SPEAKER_09]: There should be a new name for Call of Duty.

282
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, lots of Call of Duty fans everywhere.

283
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got a fan about five times in the past 60 seconds.

284
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:53,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, Call of Duty, you know, if you're going to be calling in, like, duty, that was last week's show, okay?

285
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:54,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty.

286
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:55,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

287
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:57,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Call of Duty 3.

288
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:05,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, there's details on the Wii version of Call of Duty 3, which, I don't know how that's going to work out, but, um,

289
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:27,562
[SPEAKER_09]: at any rate they're basically working on having it they actually don't have a release date scheduled for the Wii release but they are going to say it's going to be released this year speculation is pointing out November around Thanksgiving there hasn't been any real

290
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Gameplay, I think.

291
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:38,834
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just saying, though, that what they're working on is actually using the Wii Remote for position pointing, for that type of thing.

292
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:43,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty... It doesn't sound like they're very far along, and they're going to have that thing out at the end of the year?

293
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:44,819
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty aggressive.

294
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:46,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say so.

295
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be alarmed at that.

296
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:53,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no matter what type of game it is, if they're still kind of early on here, and they're trying to get that out by the end of the year.

297
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:56,847
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're basically saying that they're going to center the...

298
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:00,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Redicule on the screen so that you use the controller.

299
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:02,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Innovative idea.

300
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:08,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Different, but... It sounds very similar to Red Steel.

301
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:11,354
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they move from that.

302
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:14,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

303
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:15,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

304
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we shall move on, yes?

305
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:19,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's!

306
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:19,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

307
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:27,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider was going to be remade for the PSP, but then there was an announcement on Core Design's website that said it was cancelled.

308
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:38,478
[SPEAKER_03]: The video of Tomb Raider 10th Anniversary that appeared on certain sites was an unauthorized release of an internal presentation of a game that was being developed by Core Design until very recently.

309
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:41,521
[SPEAKER_03]: It was running on PSP and used Core Developed Engine.

310
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:45,946
[SPEAKER_03]: However, following a recent review, this project has been officially cancelled by SCI.

311
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,717
[SPEAKER_03]: But is Tomb Raider really cancelled?

312
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:52,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Eurogamer came out and said, no, the remake isn't cancelled.

313
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,941
[SPEAKER_03]: SCI just issued a new statement saying that, hey, it's back on.

314
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:07,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently not only are you going to be able to download Tomb Raider through this whole, you know, PSP, download the PlayStation 1 games thing, but now there's going to be an official remake on the PSP.

315
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like there was for Twisted Metal 2.

316
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Twisted Metal, whatever the hell it was called.

317
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:14,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I had that game too, and

318
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Very disappointing.

319
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,382
[SPEAKER_02]: A launch game that's actually a rehash of an old game.

320
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:21,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

321
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:24,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of burned out on Tomb Raider.

322
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:29,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider was cool many years ago when it was on the PC and it was cutting edge at the time.

323
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how excited I would be about a remake.

324
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:36,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not a fan of the Xbox 360 one, the recent one that just came out.

325
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:37,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my hands on.

326
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,697
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't for me.

327
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:40,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

328
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:42,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of upgrades of old games...

329
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Final Fantasy VII.

330
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:48,901
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen websites taking pre-orders for it.

331
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:55,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And, well, Square's come out and, of course, said, Final Fantasy VII Remake on PlayStation 3.

332
00:21:57,488 --> 00:22:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, we haven't confirmed that's in development.

333
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:06,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have confirmed that Final Fantasy XIII's in development.

334
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:08,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, there's no...

335
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,161
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not working on a Final Fantasy 7 remake Will it happen?

336
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:34,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably So they didn't say no They didn't say no, they're just not working on it They just said, we haven't said it Yeah And fanboys everywhere still have hope And it's basically, we have not confirmed a Final Fantasy remake at any time So, we haven't confirmed it, but we didn't say no Maybe we're doing it, and maybe we're not

337
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:36,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to tell you.

338
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:37,966
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing it, okay?

339
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,448
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just... They're doing it.

340
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,129
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my theory.

341
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it.

342
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,671
[SPEAKER_03]: If they did it, would anyone care?

343
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:47,552
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing Final Fantasy everything else.

344
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:48,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

345
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:52,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweak in our chatroom says Final Fantasy VII was good, but it's time to move on, people.

346
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:53,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't mind it looking pretty.

347
00:22:54,656 --> 00:23:00,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Jada2006 seems to think they will move on after one more thing with the Final Fantasy VII franchise.

348
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be cool to see them remake VI.

349
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:03,769
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be cool.

350
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see them go back and do 4 or 6.

351
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I did find something cool.

352
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:11,155
[SPEAKER_09]: On YouTube, I found the Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy 6 demo.

353
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:13,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, you brought this up on a previous show before.

354
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:17,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I had been looking and looking and looking, and finally I was like, let me look on YouTube, and the whole thing's there.

355
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everything's on YouTube.

356
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:22,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a video on YouTube somewhere, randomly.

357
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:25,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly, though, do wish that they would remake Final Fantasy 7.

358
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Not for PlayStation 3, but you know...

359
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:29,650
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

360
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:48,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't really use her.

361
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,399
[SPEAKER_03]: You just would be happy she's there.

362
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,364
[SPEAKER_09]: There was basically a whole side quest where if you use a game, it basically is edited out code is what it is.

363
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:58,486
[SPEAKER_09]: You can run through this quest where you pick up all the stuff.

364
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:01,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you go back into the church and you see her there.

365
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:04,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, on the American version, you see her there, but when you walk forward, she just disappears.

366
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:06,372
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually bad coding.

367
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:07,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

368
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:08,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

369
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:09,975
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole quest is on the Japanese one.

370
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:10,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

371
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:12,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VII Remakes

372
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I can actually say this because I am female.

373
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:45,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid women drivers!

374
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:48,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm getting back on the freeway after stopping at a truck stop.

375
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:32,263
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm changing lanes and I signal and get into my lane and start to accelerate and this other woman and her children some type of breeder cow lady was behind a semi and then cuts me off to get in front of me and then she's like finally I just got her out of my way shot past her couldn't deal with that but like she almost clipped the front of my car and then another stupid lady on the way home

376
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:39,457
[SPEAKER_09]: In an SUV, ha ha ha, decides that she's going to tailgate me for 10 minutes.

377
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:40,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean literally.

378
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:42,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I even put on my brakes.

379
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:44,558
[SPEAKER_09]: She almost bumped me.

380
00:25:44,598 --> 00:25:45,159
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crazy.

381
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she just shoots past me.

382
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:48,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So finally I said, screw it.

383
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody else is on the road.

384
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I got in front of her and speed matched a semi.

385
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,661
[SPEAKER_09]: She turned on her brights.

386
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:56,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Now keep in mind, she's in an SUV.

387
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:57,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I drive a Lancer.

388
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:59,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I am under her lights and I'm short.

389
00:26:00,837 --> 00:26:02,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't care, plus I have tinted windows.

390
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that her bright lights are really gonna mean a damn thing to me?

391
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,080
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a bitch.

392
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I timed it for exactly 20 minutes.

393
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:11,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I speed matched a semi.

394
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:13,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I drove up.

395
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:14,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

396
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:15,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she tried to pass me.

397
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:18,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I caught up with her again.

398
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:20,226
[SPEAKER_09]: And speed matched another semi.

399
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:21,587
[SPEAKER_09]: For 10 minutes.

400
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:23,889
[SPEAKER_09]: and then kept going.

401
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:26,510
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a special place in hell for people like you.

402
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:27,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

403
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:30,493
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't tailgate people on the freeway.

404
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:31,694
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, it's dangerous.

405
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:32,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and you know what?

406
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,036
[SPEAKER_09]: She was also on her cell phone.

407
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:36,858
[SPEAKER_09]: She was on her damn cell phone.

408
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:43,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Three things I hate is stupid drivers, people driving SUVs and talking on your goddamn cell phone while you're driving.

409
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:47,026
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there is a special place in hell for people like her.

410
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:52,590
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where they have 20 cell phones around them and none of them work.

411
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:54,963
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're all ringing.

412
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're all ringing with a singular ringtone.

413
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:00,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

414
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:05,169
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I was, like, so mad.

415
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:08,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep in mind, at this time, I had been on the road for ten hours.

416
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:12,993
[SPEAKER_09]: To give you some background on this, a friend of mine who lives in San Diego for a convention got really sick.

417
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:17,156
[SPEAKER_09]: So we drove down to meet her in Bakersfield.

418
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:18,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And then drove back.

419
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:20,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is, like, a five hour drive from here.

420
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I had to drive back.

421
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:22,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

422
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,363
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just really... And I was driving back by myself by this point.

423
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:30,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so worn out and pissed off at the world that I was like, you know what?

424
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take out all of my road frustrations.

425
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did it in a completely safe way.

426
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:40,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not do it by speeding, tailgating, or in other ways driving unsafely.

427
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I just drove slowly.

428
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:43,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Speed matching a semi.

429
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

430
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:48,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my revenge.

431
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Power to me.

432
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta keep it moving.

433
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki...

434
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I can really follow that.

435
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:56,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

436
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: She touched all the key points about women drivers.

437
00:27:59,732 --> 00:28:01,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I, however, am an excellent driver.

438
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:08,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because, you know, pacing cars and, you know, getting revenge against drivers is safe driving.

439
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I was driving safely.

440
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:12,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't speed.

441
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:14,457
[SPEAKER_09]: She just couldn't get around me.

442
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:16,498
[SPEAKER_09]: She was speeding.

443
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:17,598
[SPEAKER_09]: She was doing 100.

444
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I was saving everybody else.

445
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, kids.

446
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop fighting.

447
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:21,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

448
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I don't really have an FQ of the week, but I'd like to point out an observation.

449
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:28,493
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to the drag races this weekend.

450
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:31,634
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, a lot of rednecks like drag racing.

451
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:37,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I swear to God, about half the people there didn't have shirts on, had tattoos, and drinking their beer with their kids.

452
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:38,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what, though?

453
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:41,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Jet cars are awesome.

454
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:43,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes it worth it.

455
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It appeals to the redneck in me.

456
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:47,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching a car go 260 miles an hour down, you know, a quarter mile.

457
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:57,434
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to Light Rail and some of the people that ride it.

458
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I had jury duty this week, which I had for the past two and a half weeks, which finally ended this week.

459
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

460
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:03,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.

461
00:29:04,518 --> 00:29:06,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an important civic duty, though.

462
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:15,603
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in America, if it's not going to disrupt your schedule, you're not in school or whatever, and your work will compensate for you being there, I say go.

463
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:21,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really great educational experience, but don't ride the Light Rail to the courthouse because there are some

464
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Just rude people that write it.

465
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:24,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

466
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:26,226
[SPEAKER_09]: And scully people.

467
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:27,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all of it.

468
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:28,227
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

469
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So, F you to Light Rail.

470
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, if I may, Rob, do you have an addendum?

471
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:31,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

472
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:34,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I did actually speed up when I saw somebody else's lights behind her.

473
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:35,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

474
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:38,149
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

475
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Is chat room giving you a little crap for your story, DarkSakura?

476
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

477
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some folks cheering you on.

478
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting kudos so far.

479
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some folks cheering you on there.

480
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:46,971
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

481
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:50,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say I was only punishing her and nobody else.

482
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:57,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we had a story on backwards compatibility earlier and you have somewhat of a footnote to that story.

483
00:29:58,053 --> 00:29:58,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

484
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:05,837
[SPEAKER_02]: A certain someone named Tim Schafer is a little pissed off that his game Psychonauts isn't backwards compatible on the 360.

485
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:20,509
[SPEAKER_02]: He's basically offered up to fly down his team to help make it happen, but Microsoft assured him, as well as everybody else, that they're on top of it.

486
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:29,032
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got their top men on the job, so he's not too happy about that, as well as fans of Psychonauts.

487
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:32,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you be seeing Psychonauts on 360 anytime soon?

488
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:34,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, but probably not.

489
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the next update, which at the going rate will be in about four months.

490
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:41,812
[SPEAKER_03]: About, maybe.

491
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,594
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they get Krusty Demons to work on there, because that looks funny.

492
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:52,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, BMX XXX was censored on the Xbox.

493
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:52,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

494
00:30:53,156 --> 00:30:54,497
[SPEAKER_02]: What system did we play it on?

495
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:56,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you used to have it with GameCube.

496
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:57,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a weird system.

497
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:01,519
[SPEAKER_02]: My sister and her boyfriend are borrowing it indefinitely.

498
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:02,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fun, fun.

499
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:09,947
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, there was a movie at the box office, or a movie that did pretty well at the box office this week, and maybe it'll be a game now?

500
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:11,348
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

501
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:20,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, I haven't been to see it, I really want to, but Nacho Libre has been licensed by Majesco.

502
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,272
[SPEAKER_09]: What has Majesco done lately?

503
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:28,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, to be honest.

504
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:33,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe their Wikipedia would clue us into that, I'm assuming, because Wikipedia has all this useless stuff on it.

505
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:37,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically the game's going to be done by Budcat Creations.

506
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:41,866
[SPEAKER_09]: They brought out Psychonauts and Madden NFL 2006.

507
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:48,728
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is going to be, from what I'm seeing, it's going to be on the Nintendo DS.

508
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,929
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be the first Nintendo DS game on the US and European market.

509
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will have Nacho Libre!

510
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also a mention that...

511
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:05,608
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to obtain the right to the Ghost Rider movie, but I think Take-Two got it instead.

512
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:10,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that Ghost Rider game at E3 and it got awful.

513
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,581
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have given it to somebody else.

514
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:12,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it was awful.

515
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:15,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of games and movies, I completely forgot.

516
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:23,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill, the movie, is actually coming to DVD August 22nd in the United States, so look forward to that.

517
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:31,476
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have some DVD commentaries on there, plus the origins of Silent Hill and some other stuff.

518
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:32,637
[SPEAKER_02]: No UFO ending!

519
00:32:32,937 --> 00:32:35,439
[SPEAKER_07]: It better have a UFO ending as an Easter egg.

520
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:36,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the dog.

521
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,345
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

522
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:09,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a big fan of Mexican wrestling.

523
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:30,986
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of politically oriented stories in the first half of the show, and this kind of follows that.

524
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:36,769
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESRB is now threatening $1 million game rating fines.

525
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,010
[SPEAKER_11]: $1 million!

526
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,291
[SPEAKER_03]: $1 million!

527
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:46,795
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESRB is raising this maximum penalty for a publisher who fails to disclose objectionable content.

528
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:50,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't leave your nudity on the disc.

529
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:54,603
[SPEAKER_03]: because some hacker might find it and your company is going to get sued for one million.

530
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:55,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my question though.

531
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:58,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how they have their rating system and stuff.

532
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:09,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I for a fact know that anime, like ADV for example, they do not have ratings that are done by the MPAA.

533
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:17,435
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their own ratings that they put on there that are completely independent and yet they are sold in stores out there.

534
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,416
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not betting them.

535
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:21,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Who gives a crap if they get sued a million dollars?

536
00:34:21,617 --> 00:34:25,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't they self-rate their games and still be able to put them out in the store?

537
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:30,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to get to that, is that the ESRB, you know, you might be asking, well, what happens if they don't pay the one million dollars?

538
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:41,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what the ESRB can do is revoke the rating services, and that will screw you when it comes to getting into Walmart and GameStop and all that stuff, which doesn't carry games that aren't branded.

539
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:45,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have the AO rating, I should point out.

540
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:57,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you raise a good point, but at the same time with the video games getting all this negative publicity in the sense of these laws, I don't know if a video game company would be able to get away with it the same way a movie company can.

541
00:34:58,156 --> 00:35:00,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, I mean, because they're rated.

542
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:05,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Anime is kind of its own, in the sense of movies, it's kind of its own specialty world anyway.

543
00:35:05,477 --> 00:35:09,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the ESRB is like kind of an independent company anyways.

544
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:15,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they have to be, you know, the one out there that says what the game is rated?

545
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't there be another rating system out there?

546
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:20,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it really need to be this one company?

547
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:24,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about it, they're putting these companies through a lot of stupid shit.

548
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:27,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole hot coffee thing was ridiculous to begin with.

549
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:30,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that they're threatening $1 million fines.

550
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:31,275
[SPEAKER_02]: $1 million for what?

551
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:34,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's going to teach them what?

552
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:35,418
[SPEAKER_02]: To not go with you?

553
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:35,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal.

554
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:37,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's an independent company.

555
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see what the big deal is.

556
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Just self-rate your games.

557
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:44,313
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we did before we even had these ESRB things.

558
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:46,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It either didn't have a rating or they were self-rated.

559
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:48,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So, big deal.

560
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:49,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

561
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, take us to our next story.

562
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:58,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of craziness, I swear to God it should be a segment on this show.

563
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,707
[SPEAKER_02]: What crazy thing did Sony say this week?

564
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:07,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Kutaragi, he came out and said...

565
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:17,112
[SPEAKER_02]: As the PlayStation 3 is a computer, we might even offer it on a build-to-order basis, customized to the needs of each and every user.

566
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:19,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

567
00:36:19,953 --> 00:36:20,714
[SPEAKER_02]: You are retarded.

568
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:23,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a gateway PlayStation 3?

569
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a PC?

570
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:26,897
[SPEAKER_09]: A gate station?

571
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:28,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you're getting a PS3.

572
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:29,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

573
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:31,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a PC.

574
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:32,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

575
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:36,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony seems to really be working that.

576
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:37,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a computer angle.

577
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:40,075
[SPEAKER_09]: All that to avoid taxes in the UK.

578
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:42,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

579
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:44,218
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get it.

580
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:47,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of people in power at companies, did you hear this?

581
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:51,263
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't maybe directly affect gaming, but it is important to note.

582
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:58,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerds everywhere were noting that Bill Gates has announced that he's stepping down from his head position at Microsoft in 2008.

583
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,381
[SPEAKER_03]: and what's going to happen after July of 2008.

584
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Gates will kind of function only in like an advisory role.

585
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:07,763
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not going to really be doing the day-to-day functions.

586
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:09,024
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll just sit back and make money on it.

587
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:14,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he wants to focus on the charity stuff, which is cool, and it's got him a lot of notoriety in recent years, right?

588
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:15,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't he People of the Year?

589
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:18,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it last year or the year before with his wife and Bono?

590
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:19,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

591
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:19,908
[SPEAKER_02]: For their charity work?

592
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:22,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised he's being able to retire in two years.

593
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't he going to go broke like tomorrow?

594
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:26,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I somehow doubt that.

595
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,362
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the billions of dollars that he's making.

596
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:31,745
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be really struggling.

597
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:33,227
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have to cut back.

598
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:42,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Expect to see Ray Ozzie, who is the Chief Technical Officer, start to kind of take on a bigger role there.

599
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:54,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Not saying he's necessarily going to be a replacement, but he's going to assume the title of Chief Software Architect and work side-by-side with Gates on technical architecture and product oversight responsibilities.

600
00:37:54,991 --> 00:38:00,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might start seeing some of those other folks there at Microsoft starting to fill the shoes of Bill Gates.

601
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:05,599
[SPEAKER_03]: One person whose shoes cannot be filled is the great and terrible Dark Sakura.

602
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:08,884
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, who's emailing us this week?

603
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, tonight I actually just have three emails.

604
00:38:38,153 --> 00:38:46,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because I got one that wasn't really a particularly appropriate question, and then a few others that were just sight suggestions.

605
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:50,084
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, thank you to our friend Rob with two Bs.

606
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we have our first email comes from Matt in the UK.

607
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:56,450
[SPEAKER_09]: He's really awesome.

608
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that your show is awesome.

609
00:38:58,823 --> 00:39:02,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wish that I lived in a different time zone so I can listen to your shows live.

610
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:04,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I listen to your podcasts all the time.

611
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:07,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I always learn something new when I listen to OLR and you guys always make me laugh.

612
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:08,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

613
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:12,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if you've ever thought of coming down to the UK sometime.

614
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:14,969
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the odd convention going on here and there.

615
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:18,770
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do come down here sometime, it would make me the happiest pretty on the aisle.

616
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:22,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Your show is amazing and I hope you carry on for many years to come.

617
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:35,861
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

618
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:58,763
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do SakuraCon next year, which I'm understanding we've already been approved guests or whatever, we're going to have to pay for that to go there.

619
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:03,246
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be driving our way to Washington.

620
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:07,089
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to help us out with plane money, sure we'll come.

621
00:40:07,563 --> 00:40:09,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to check out the UK.

622
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:09,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always wanted to go there.

623
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:11,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We should start to send Orange Lounge to Britain.

624
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:13,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see.

625
00:40:13,385 --> 00:40:13,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

626
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So someday.

627
00:40:16,026 --> 00:40:16,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't count it out.

628
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I still want to go there to travel, so I will pay for it someday.

629
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:24,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just hopefully Orange Lounge Radio is still around next year and years.

630
00:40:24,228 --> 00:40:26,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know it will be, but, you know, when I can afford it.

631
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:32,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I got actually a non-story email from Rob.

632
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:43,194
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just an idea I have, but if Pin Mame and Wii use the Wii-type control scheme, realistic nudges could be modeled for the first time on a home game in those virtual tables that you talked about last week.

633
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:46,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, nothing comes close to a full-thrust nudge on a table with no tilt.

634
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:49,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think it's got to be Pin Mame.

635
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:52,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I think any pinball simulator on the Wii could incorporate that idea.

636
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,421
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a dang good idea.

637
00:40:55,082 --> 00:41:00,546
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also have one from, I think, another map.

638
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:14,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to let you know that on www.abtelectronics.com they have the PS3 available for pre-order.

639
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,567
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing is that you can't really pre-order it.

640
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:21,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of the add to cart button it is replaced with an authorized button which takes you to nowhere.

641
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:22,613
[SPEAKER_09]: You should check it out.

642
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to the website and click on video game consoles under video games tab.

643
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:30,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, buddy, but I've never heard of that site, and I would never buy a system from a site.

644
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:32,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never dropped $600 on a site I've never heard of.

645
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:43,114
[SPEAKER_03]: But you give a good chance for us to bring up this opportunity to say, don't buy from places that you don't have a trust in.

646
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:48,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know this company, so I'm not trying to knock it, but I've never heard of it.

647
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:54,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you get anything like that, your best friend for any internet ordering place is...

648
00:41:55,268 --> 00:41:57,489
[SPEAKER_09]: and the Better Business Bureau website.

649
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Check anything out before you order online.

650
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Read their feedback or you could really be burned.

651
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:07,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And just make sure that you do your research before you go through any of those websites.

652
00:42:07,756 --> 00:42:09,377
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I wanted to bring that email up.

653
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:12,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it is funny that they're taking pre-orders that go to nowhere.

654
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just something they want to make and it's broken or I don't know.

655
00:42:17,522 --> 00:42:18,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming soon.

656
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:18,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

657
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:19,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be.

658
00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:20,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Under construction.

659
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:23,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody in chat room is saying anything about that site so I don't know.

660
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:23,686
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

661
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:25,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

662
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:26,749
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be all.

663
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, send us more email.

664
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:34,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, meanwhile, you want to be a beta tester?

665
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:41,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if you do, then you better head on over to Atari's website.

666
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:48,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they're doing an online beta test for the PlayStation 2 version of their new Test Drive Unlimited.

667
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:57,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can go and sign up right now at www.atari.com slash TDU beta test.

668
00:42:58,144 --> 00:42:58,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

669
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:00,696
[SPEAKER_02]: You can basically sign up there.

670
00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:06,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're saying that you're going to be under a strict non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.

671
00:43:07,801 --> 00:43:08,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Standard.

672
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:15,146
[SPEAKER_02]: You will need to have a PlayStation 2 console, including a broadband internet connection and network adapter.

673
00:43:17,168 --> 00:43:17,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

674
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:20,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, be sure to check that out.

675
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:22,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, though, if I am picked...

676
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not bite by that indie.

677
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:51,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Please give these guys a call first.

678
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:52,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Echo 123.

679
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to add them to their friends list.

680
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,400
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have told me, well, I tried calling you, but they wouldn't accept my friend invite.

681
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,160
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to.

682
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a computer.

683
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,681
[SPEAKER_03]: You just put that in as your call, and it'll pick up right away, and you can hear what you sound like.

684
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:06,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So please give them a call first.

685
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:07,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you sound good.

686
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:08,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Then give us a call.

687
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:10,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, we get angry.

688
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:14,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be right after this story about the DS Lights.

689
00:44:14,663 --> 00:44:17,064
[SPEAKER_03]: on Japanese airline JAL.

690
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:24,328
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be offering their first class and executive class passengers DS Lights to play during the flight's duration.

691
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:28,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a special promotion that's going on until August 31st.

692
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think you have to be in Japan to use this, no.

693
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:43,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, the routes would include Tokyo, New York City, Tokyo, Chicago, Tokyo, LA, Tokyo, San Francisco, Tokyo, London, Tokyo, Beijing, and one other one, Tokyo, Guangzhou.

694
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:46,404
[SPEAKER_03]: If I horribly butchered that, I'm sorry.

695
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:52,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have JAL going to Tokyo from where you are, chances are you'll have a chance to do this.

696
00:44:53,408 --> 00:45:01,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the DS Lite's Wi-Fi capabilities have been taken out because you're not supposed to have wireless and all that stuff interfering on the planes.

697
00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:11,260
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you will get a chance to do a Japanese brain training game, an English brain training game, Otona no DS Golf, and Mario Kart.

698
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,762
[SPEAKER_09]: So no snaking on a plane?

699
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:19,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

700
00:45:20,902 --> 00:45:23,083
[SPEAKER_03]: That's got to be one of the worst jokes ever told on this show.

701
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:23,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

702
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:25,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm full of them.

703
00:45:25,445 --> 00:45:26,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll keep them coming.

704
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:28,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been borrowing from 23Megas.

705
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:28,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

706
00:45:28,947 --> 00:45:32,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, our... The roll of toilet paper is right here.

707
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:36,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Skype line is open over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

708
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Interact With Us or you can pick up your phone and call 916-226-9067.

709
00:45:38,812 --> 00:45:38,893
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

710
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:41,954
[SPEAKER_03]: D.S.

711
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:42,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Light D.S.

712
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:42,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Light

713
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:07,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, a thousand of them got stolen in Hong Kong.

714
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:08,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard about this.

715
00:46:08,486 --> 00:46:12,166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Luminous' fault because it taught us how to move crates, remember?

716
00:46:12,866 --> 00:46:13,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they sure did.

717
00:46:14,927 --> 00:46:16,047
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about that?

718
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:19,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is that... I think it's crazy.

719
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:20,388
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's crazy?

720
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:21,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

721
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:22,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Because somebody was able to get away with it?

722
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:23,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Stealing all that?

723
00:46:23,728 --> 00:46:24,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

724
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:27,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't you watch 24?

725
00:46:27,629 --> 00:46:29,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone like Jack Bauer can do anything.

726
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you're right, but he's dead.

727
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:32,810
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not dead.

728
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,999
[SPEAKER_13]: If he died, the show wouldn't continue.

729
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, one of the geeks died.

730
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,600
[SPEAKER_13]: That made me sad.

731
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, anyway, this is about games.

732
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,461
[SPEAKER_13]: This is about games.

733
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:40,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to say about DS Lite?

734
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:43,322
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but I have a question for you.

735
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:44,382
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

736
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:45,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question for you.

737
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:46,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what?

738
00:46:46,522 --> 00:46:46,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Me?

739
00:46:46,822 --> 00:46:47,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what?

740
00:46:48,663 --> 00:46:52,544
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the longest loading screen you ever encountered in a game?

741
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:56,604
[SPEAKER_03]: of recent memory, Final Fantasy XI.

742
00:46:56,664 --> 00:46:57,284
[SPEAKER_03]: We timed it.

743
00:46:57,304 --> 00:47:01,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes 1 minute 59 seconds to get from boot up into the actual game.

744
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may not sound like a long time, but it is.

745
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:06,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultramix 3 also had a pretty horrible load time.

746
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:08,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes like a minute to get in there after the title screen.

747
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:09,587
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty bad.

748
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:11,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Any of the KLF games on Saturn.

749
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:12,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

750
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:14,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto's got a pretty bad one.

751
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:18,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Oblivion does too, but I can understand an Oblivion's case because once you get in there, it's pretty good.

752
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:21,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Street Fighter Alpha on the Super Nintendo had loading time.

753
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:22,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

754
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:23,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

755
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:24,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it did.

756
00:47:24,538 --> 00:47:25,139
[SPEAKER_09]: It was horrible.

757
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:34,926
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd go to the scene, and then a character would pop up after 30 seconds, and then another character would pop up, and then the voice would load in, and then it would start.

758
00:47:35,246 --> 00:47:36,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chat room's taking an opportunity.

759
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:37,268
[SPEAKER_13]: One more thing.

760
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:37,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sure.

761
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:44,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a custom-built Super Nintendo controller that is custom-made for a computer.

762
00:47:45,114 --> 00:47:45,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Where'd you get this?

763
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:46,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this something you did yourself?

764
00:47:47,776 --> 00:47:48,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I ordered it.

765
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:49,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

766
00:47:50,058 --> 00:47:52,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I ordered it online on eBay.

767
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

768
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:53,378
[SPEAKER_13]: How's it work?

769
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:54,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

770
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:55,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Works perfectly.

771
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:59,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just using a bunch of different converters?

772
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:04,583
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's a Super Nintendo controller that is USB interface and it works great with all emulators.

773
00:48:04,703 --> 00:48:05,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And you got this on eBay?

774
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:06,784
[SPEAKER_13]: On eBay.

775
00:48:06,924 --> 00:48:07,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you remember the seller's name?

776
00:48:08,204 --> 00:48:09,165
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can recommend it?

777
00:48:09,825 --> 00:48:12,086
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't know the website.

778
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:13,366
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy makes all of them.

779
00:48:13,386 --> 00:48:15,067
[SPEAKER_13]: He even made a Power Glove.

780
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:16,933
[SPEAKER_13]: ComputerOne.

781
00:48:17,153 --> 00:48:17,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

782
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:24,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, do you remember, though, the people who made the PC out of the Nintendo?

783
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:28,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember someone did an Atari one.

784
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:40,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the site's gone now, but he was actually building them for people and selling, and he was making the controller into a USB and also converting the Super Nintendo mouse into a PC mouse.

785
00:48:41,883 --> 00:48:43,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, they do have that on.

786
00:48:43,284 --> 00:48:44,104
[SPEAKER_13]: I did see that.

787
00:48:44,604 --> 00:48:45,224
[SPEAKER_13]: The mouse one.

788
00:48:45,244 --> 00:48:45,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to buy it.

789
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:47,685
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like $24.

790
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:49,866
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was building it basically out of laptop parts.

791
00:48:50,486 --> 00:48:54,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And just putting a USB connector instead of the regular plug-in.

792
00:48:55,388 --> 00:48:56,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And setting up drivers for it.

793
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:03,982
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin, I want to point out as well, the chat room is giving quite a response to your question about load times.

794
00:49:04,022 --> 00:49:06,644
[SPEAKER_03]: HitStun saying, Half-Life 2 takes me forever to load.

795
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:11,505
[SPEAKER_03]: YouWillBowToMe says, MidnightClubDub for PSP has hella load times.

796
00:49:12,206 --> 00:49:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.

797
00:49:13,026 --> 00:49:17,208
[SPEAKER_03]: XanderK says, The Sims 2 for PSP has the crappiest loads ever.

798
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, I didn't expect such a response to this.

799
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,690
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just a random question.

800
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,331
[SPEAKER_03]: See how easy it is to get a response out of people?

801
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:27,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get on a microphone and start yelling.

802
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:30,646
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I know you got a bunch of calls, so I'm going to let it go.

803
00:49:30,686 --> 00:49:31,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got a couple.

804
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:32,968
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, Ravenstolphin.

805
00:49:32,988 --> 00:49:33,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the call.

806
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:34,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

807
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:36,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

808
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:39,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

809
00:49:39,353 --> 00:49:39,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

810
00:49:40,774 --> 00:49:41,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Diginova.

811
00:49:41,955 --> 00:49:42,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Diginova.

812
00:49:43,477 --> 00:49:44,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?

813
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:45,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let you know it's sunrise here at the moment.

814
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:46,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

815
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:47,720
[SPEAKER_03]: What time is it over there?

816
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:49,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 4.30 in the morning.

817
00:49:50,002 --> 00:49:52,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell where you're from from the sound of your voice.

818
00:49:52,444 --> 00:49:53,965
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, wow, mightily.

819
00:49:53,985 --> 00:49:54,606
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound tired.

820
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:02,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to go to bed at midnight, but I asked my fiancé, could I please just stay up and listen to you guys because I've got the time off because I've just changed jobs.

821
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:04,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank your fiancé for us.

822
00:50:04,764 --> 00:50:06,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for being so dedicated.

823
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:07,566
[SPEAKER_03]: You're crazy.

824
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:08,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

825
00:50:08,486 --> 00:50:09,026
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

826
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:10,087
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to share with listeners?

827
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:12,228
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually two points.

828
00:50:12,248 --> 00:50:14,509
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'll make it quick because I know you guys got other people calling.

829
00:50:14,669 --> 00:50:19,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I was watching the TV show called Gamer TV.

830
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:20,432
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here in Bravo.

831
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:22,673
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Sky thing, Rupert Murdoch thing anyway.

832
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:24,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say we get that over here.

833
00:50:24,576 --> 00:50:27,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they used to show that on a G4 at some point?

834
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:28,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamer TV?

835
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

836
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:31,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different network though, but yeah.

837
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

838
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:32,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

839
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:50,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, in backing up what you were saying about games and parents and the rest, but this one in particular was about a doctor in Chicago saying games are very good and how they influence the mind and how keyhole surgery it was, I've forgotten what his name was, it's on there, but it was

840
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:54,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Really interesting to the point of you saying how games were influencing.

841
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:55,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought I'd bring that up.

842
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second point was, when the hell are they going to release OutRun for the backwards compatibility?

843
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:02,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one reason why I kept my game.

844
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:02,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

845
00:51:02,803 --> 00:51:04,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that guy.

846
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,982
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

847
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:32,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I read it in a psychological journal.

848
00:51:32,576 --> 00:51:43,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually read a test in a psychological journal that was talking about reaction times, especially when playing puzzle games, RPGs, versus non-gamers, and that the gamer group came out way ahead.

849
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,582
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too bad our politicians don't seem to be counting any of that.

850
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:51,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's nothing over here in the same sort of politics way going towards gaming.

851
00:51:52,505 --> 00:51:53,025
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

852
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:56,345
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it over there?

853
00:51:56,405 --> 00:52:04,430
[SPEAKER_03]: While I've got a UK listener on the phone, I can kind of ask, what is the impression over there of what is going on over here with the gaming laws?

854
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:10,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is it we're a bunch of crazies over here in America, or is it, well, the same thing's happening over here?

855
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:11,435
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

856
00:52:31,533 --> 00:52:32,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's rude, but in a funny way.

857
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I was laughing to him and saying, that's not good customer service.

858
00:52:56,753 --> 00:52:57,554
[SPEAKER_01]: You work in a bank.

859
00:52:57,914 --> 00:53:01,097
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rude, rude, and then there's rude funny.

860
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:02,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan's rude funny.

861
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

862
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow or another, he gets away with it.

863
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:12,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually, I work for a bank myself, and there's a big difference in the level of customer, though.

864
00:53:13,288 --> 00:53:15,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, over here, we've got, like, it's just a local bank.

865
00:53:16,011 --> 00:53:19,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's national, it's owned by RBS, World Bank of Scotland, but

866
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:20,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Outrun Outrun Outrun Outrun

867
00:53:38,890 --> 00:54:07,687
[SPEAKER_03]: usually when they get one they get about like 20 because you know they weren't targeting that Barbie adventure game and I don't know how many times I've said this to people when they bitch about why is Barbie emulatable and you know Outrun isn't well because not that I'm saying this because Mattel paid for it well no because Barbie is probably very similar in it's design to I don't know Halo or one of the games that is already playable I'm not trying to say Barbie's like Halo but you know

868
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to...

869
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:11,893
[SPEAKER_03]: 8-bit and 16-bit emulation.

870
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:12,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost the same way.

871
00:54:12,993 --> 00:54:14,854
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, the NES games.

872
00:54:15,314 --> 00:54:18,135
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of NES games are assigned to certain mappers.

873
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:22,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get into too much detail, but all the NES games are on certain mappers.

874
00:54:22,616 --> 00:54:34,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a lot of these obscure Japanese titles, the reason why those were the last ones to be emulated on NES emulators is because their mappers were not one of the standard... I think there's like five or six standard ones.

875
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,140
[SPEAKER_03]: The crazy ones are outside of that.

876
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have to basically write new code for each mapper.

877
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:42,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that idea and apply it to Xbox and Xbox 360.

878
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what's going on.

879
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:50,664
[SPEAKER_03]: When you unlock one big game, you might unlock a bunch of little crappy ones that were similar in design.

880
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:54,025
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not that Xbox is targeting those crap games.

881
00:54:54,105 --> 00:54:57,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that it just happens that they work so it can just boost their numbers.

882
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:58,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yippee!

883
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:03,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It raises the whole situation you said about PlayStation 3.

884
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,529
[SPEAKER_01]: They put simply just a PlayStation in there.

885
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:06,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, with the

886
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:07,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for calling in.

887
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:08,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for calling in.

888
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:32,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleep well!

889
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:35,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever he finally goes to sleep there.

890
00:55:36,471 --> 00:55:41,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to point out here in the chatroom, BlackWolf, our buddy Bobby, over on... They're on Captain N again.

891
00:55:42,193 --> 00:55:42,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

892
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:43,733
[SPEAKER_09]: They're on Captain N again.

893
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:44,474
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, not Bobby.

894
00:55:44,514 --> 00:55:48,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's saying, well, he might be somewhere else, but Bobby is saying that they did target Big Mother Truckers.

895
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:51,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

896
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:54,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a certain demographic that goes for that, you know.

897
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:57,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all... I know, I know.

898
00:55:57,698 --> 00:55:58,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do one more call here.

899
00:55:58,759 --> 00:55:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

900
00:55:59,779 --> 00:56:00,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

901
00:56:00,459 --> 00:56:01,640
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one and only man.

902
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:08,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one and only choppy Legend of Zaku, who's choppy, choppy in and out, who needs to turn off the porn torrents.

903
00:56:08,629 --> 00:56:09,029
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

904
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:09,649
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

905
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:17,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I got word on the street that Supernova's coming out this Wednesday in Dave & Buster's in Times Square.

906
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:22,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the three or four listeners we have in Times Square, they're going to be really happy.

907
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:30,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, I mean, it's been confirmed by folks who have been, who are on the inside of the company and the people that work there, so...

908
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:36,014
[SPEAKER_10]: And since I'm 21, that's a definite of me actually going there that Wednesday.

909
00:56:36,154 --> 00:56:39,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, hooray for you, but what about the rest of us?

910
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:41,096
[SPEAKER_09]: We have listeners in New York.

911
00:56:41,216 --> 00:56:42,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that.

912
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:47,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but we have lots of listeners, a fraction of which live in New York.

913
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,361
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm trying to get at, here's what I'm trying to get at.

914
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:54,964
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is, is this going to be a trend for Dave and Buster's?

915
00:56:55,609 --> 00:56:57,150
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's lots of Dave and Buster's everywhere.

916
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:03,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I think from what I'm hearing is that they're going to phase out their pump-it-up machines and supernovas.

917
00:57:03,694 --> 00:57:05,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, Miklatov's going to be pissed.

918
00:57:06,116 --> 00:57:07,357
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm hearing right there.

919
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:09,338
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to use that as a replacement.

920
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:10,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the DDR's gone legit here.

921
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:12,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

922
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see what happens.

923
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with your Supernova.

924
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:17,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess take pictures.

925
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:18,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us a review.

926
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,452
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want any reviews or any info, I should be able to provide it by next Sunday.

927
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:25,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't want to sound like a jerk, but we did kind of get to play it at E3.

928
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:29,453
[SPEAKER_10]: This one will be the final one, though.

929
00:57:29,473 --> 00:57:30,053
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

930
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:31,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let us know if there's anything different.

931
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:32,213
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

932
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:34,794
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anything different from what we saw at E3, then let us know.

933
00:57:35,454 --> 00:57:35,734
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

934
00:57:35,774 --> 00:57:36,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you back the skinny.

935
00:57:37,194 --> 00:57:37,514
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

936
00:57:37,574 --> 00:57:38,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Zach, we got to go.

937
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:39,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We got more calls coming in.

938
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

939
00:57:39,795 --> 00:57:40,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

940
00:57:41,415 --> 00:57:42,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun in your Times Square.

941
00:57:43,135 --> 00:57:44,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I do love Times Square, though.

942
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I love New York City.

943
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:48,856
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do live there and listen to this show, you're lucky, because I do love that place.

944
00:57:49,376 --> 00:57:50,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another phone call.

945
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:51,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

946
00:57:51,617 --> 00:57:52,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

947
00:57:53,757 --> 00:57:56,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky, I was joking about Big Mother Truckers.

948
00:57:57,658 --> 00:57:58,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Bobby.

949
00:57:58,458 --> 00:57:59,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Kidding.

950
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:00,878
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

951
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:04,919
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't say things in chat like that without putting a JK or something.

952
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:05,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

953
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:07,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the JK.

954
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:07,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It was silent.

955
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,780
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on the internet, therefore it must be true.

956
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

957
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:12,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You got me.

958
00:58:16,177 --> 00:58:18,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that, since you got me, I will let you pimp your show.

959
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:19,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.

960
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:20,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my show?

961
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:21,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

962
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:23,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my show is the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

963
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:28,860
[SPEAKER_11]: We're on allgames.com, and we talked about how table tennis does actually have a whore in it.

964
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesper.

965
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:31,740
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Jesper.

966
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,081
[SPEAKER_11]: He is a whore.

967
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:36,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody who's played table tennis knows Jesper's a big whore.

968
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:37,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he is.

969
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:38,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to clear that up.

970
00:58:39,022 --> 00:58:39,562
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, no problem.

971
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll say Bobby.

972
00:58:40,592 --> 00:58:43,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Allgames.com Allgames.com Allgames.com

973
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Say it enough times and people will go there, Bobby.

974
00:59:11,902 --> 00:59:13,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Ballgames.com All right, have a good one.

975
00:59:14,163 --> 00:59:14,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

976
00:59:14,643 --> 00:59:14,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

977
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:17,425
[SPEAKER_03]: We love Bobby.

978
00:59:17,465 --> 00:59:17,945
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so cool.

979
00:59:18,906 --> 00:59:19,446
[SPEAKER_03]: One more call.

980
00:59:19,486 --> 00:59:21,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I lied before when I said that Zaku would be last.

981
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:22,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing one more.

982
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:23,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

983
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:24,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

984
00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Anoush.

985
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:26,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Anoush.

986
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:27,231
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

987
00:59:27,451 --> 00:59:29,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did butcher your name earlier, didn't I?

988
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know, and knowing's half the battle.

989
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:34,675
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Anoush?

990
00:59:35,515 --> 00:59:36,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick question.

991
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:43,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys think that Sony is just going to surprise us all right at launch with all these games and things that no one was expecting?

992
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, it's like the remix.

993
00:59:48,078 --> 00:59:48,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's echoing there.

994
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:50,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful, buddy.

995
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn down your volume there.

996
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so because Sony isn't very smart.

997
00:59:58,626 --> 00:59:59,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree.

998
00:59:59,327 --> 01:00:02,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sony has surprises left in store.

999
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have to.

1000
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:05,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sony...

1001
01:00:07,578 --> 01:00:10,799
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to have to do something to make up for E3.

1002
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what that is, but it will be a surprise when it's said.

1003
01:00:16,181 --> 01:00:20,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that Sony is going to leave themselves in this hole that they've dug.

1004
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:33,528
[SPEAKER_03]: What they need to do is they need to gag everybody at that company, shut the F up, do not talk about PS3 anymore, stop talking to the gaming press, and then two months before the system comes out, we will have the bang-up press conference.

1005
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:35,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a do-over...

1006
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:37,859
[SPEAKER_03]: and do it right this time.

1007
01:00:37,919 --> 01:00:44,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm using the internal mic for my MacBook Pro.

1008
01:00:45,045 --> 01:00:45,605
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

1009
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:48,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Anoush, any other thoughts on that that you want to share?

1010
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:49,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing really.

1011
01:00:49,868 --> 01:00:50,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1012
01:00:51,069 --> 01:00:54,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for the question, but I've got to hang up because the echo is driving me nuts.

1013
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:58,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I love what Xander K. said in the chat.

1014
01:00:58,435 --> 01:00:59,396
[SPEAKER_08]: What did Xander K. say?

1015
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:02,038
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of sounds like my wife's breast pump.

1016
01:01:02,098 --> 01:01:02,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross.

1017
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:04,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so nasty.

1018
01:01:06,516 --> 01:01:07,556
[SPEAKER_03]: That was freaky.

1019
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:10,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Skye's voice second mix from Dark Tetsuya.

1020
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:12,377
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounded scary.

1021
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:16,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know, like I was in Poltergeist or something.

1022
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:17,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, any last minute stories?

1023
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:19,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Come into the light, Rob.

1024
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:21,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last minute stories here in studio?

1025
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:35,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to mention, since we talked about Table Tennis, that Grand Theft Auto 4 is actually going to be using Table Tennis' graphic engine called Rage, Rockstar's advanced game engine, for Grand Theft Auto 4.

1026
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:36,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be pretty sweet.

1027
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:39,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, table tennis is a good-looking game.

1028
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope it carries over into Grand Theft Auto.

1029
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:42,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it will.

1030
01:01:42,572 --> 01:01:43,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no doubt it'll look sexy.

1031
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:44,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.

1032
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:46,374
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, did you have anything?

1033
01:01:48,975 --> 01:01:53,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there is a list out, a very special list.

1034
01:01:53,437 --> 01:01:53,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1035
01:01:54,638 --> 01:01:59,841
[SPEAKER_09]: This is basically the list of games that have been released since Duke Nukem Forever was announced.

1036
01:02:01,462 --> 01:02:01,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

1037
01:02:01,902 --> 01:02:01,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1038
01:02:02,656 --> 01:02:03,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Duke Nukem Forever

1039
01:02:32,586 --> 01:03:01,612
[SPEAKER_09]: The Legend of Zelda series since Ocarina of Time a bunch of over 75 games in the Mega Man universe 12 games featuring Mega Man universe character cameos 50 games in the Star Wars universe Mario has been in 58 different games since it was announced every Thief game, every version of Counter Strike Half-Life every Tony Hawk game video game systems, the Xbox was released and all the systems since then it also lists some fun facts

1040
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:09,080
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1997, the fastest consumer internet connection was a 33.6 KBPS modem.

1041
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,462
[SPEAKER_09]: On average, consumer internet connections were 300 times faster today.

1042
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:18,744
[SPEAKER_09]: When Duke Nukem Forever was announced, the fastest processor was a 233 MHz Pentium.

1043
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:23,525
[SPEAKER_09]: In April 1997, there was no Google and there was no eBay.

1044
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:24,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

1045
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,120
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there was eBay.

1046
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:30,761
[SPEAKER_03]: There was eBay.

1047
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:32,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It just was not even what it was now.

1048
01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:34,423
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was no weblog.

1049
01:03:36,864 --> 01:03:46,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as disasters, it says there's been 125 hurricanes happened since then, 20 death toll-producing tornado outbreaks in the United States, and 50 major earthquakes in the world.

1050
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:50,370
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, it's been a long freaking time since they announced Duke Nukem.

1051
01:03:50,531 --> 01:03:54,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Britney Spears' entire musical career as a pop star took place since the announcement.

1052
01:03:54,553 --> 01:03:56,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody had a lot of free time on their hands.

1053
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,054
[SPEAKER_09]: This is fabulous.

1054
01:03:57,094 --> 01:03:57,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1055
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:01,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is great.

1056
01:04:02,196 --> 01:04:03,977
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 new members have been elected to the Senate.

1057
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:08,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill Clinton finished his presidential term and George Bush came on.

1058
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:12,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Four nations acquired nuclear weapons technology.

1059
01:04:12,663 --> 01:04:14,665
[SPEAKER_09]: 19 wars have begun and five wars have ended.

1060
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze wants to know why this wasn't side of the week.

1061
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:24,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I didn't think about it, because we wanted to do Sexy Roth and we had already decided last week.

1062
01:04:24,952 --> 01:04:25,352
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1063
01:04:26,232 --> 01:04:29,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm logging into eBay right now to see when I actually... It was worth a mention, most assuredly.

1064
01:04:30,815 --> 01:04:32,096
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank whoever sent it to me.

1065
01:04:33,377 --> 01:04:35,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm logging in to see when I bought something on eBay.

1066
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought something on eBay.

1067
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this, on my feedback.

1068
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:39,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Prompt, response, and payment.

1069
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:40,862
[SPEAKER_03]: A pleasure to do business with.

1070
01:04:41,403 --> 01:04:45,866
[SPEAKER_03]: April 26, 1997 was when that feedback was left on my account.

1071
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:48,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old school.

1072
01:04:49,508 --> 01:04:53,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feedback rating of 3, because the last time I bought something from eBay, you know when the last feedback was left? 99%.

1073
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, though, I bought Super Metroid.

1074
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, none of you care.

1075
01:04:57,989 --> 01:04:58,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I talking about it?

1076
01:04:58,829 --> 01:04:59,309
[SPEAKER_03]: None of you care.

1077
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,631
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one more phone call because I forgot I promised this person they could be on tonight.

1078
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1079
01:05:04,771 --> 01:05:05,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1080
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know it was a promise.

1081
01:05:07,092 --> 01:05:08,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's DMN.

1082
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:09,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, DMN.

1083
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:10,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember saying something about it.

1084
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:10,893
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

1085
01:05:11,973 --> 01:05:14,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I found out how to give away the Wii.

1086
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:16,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's right.

1087
01:05:16,835 --> 01:05:17,835
[SPEAKER_03]: You're giving away a Wii.

1088
01:05:18,455 --> 01:05:18,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1089
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:20,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how are you going to give away a Wii?

1090
01:05:21,072 --> 01:05:24,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because I'm a huge fan of interactivity, just like you guys are.

1091
01:05:24,535 --> 01:05:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: People who come, listen live in the chatroom, and argue appropriately with your discussion get points.

1092
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:32,941
[SPEAKER_04]: The more points they get, the more stuff they get.

1093
01:05:33,382 --> 01:05:38,205
[SPEAKER_04]: If they win during the week, right now, actually, Funnydale's kicking everyone's ass.

1094
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,447
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a t-shirt from Nintendo.

1095
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:42,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So Funnydale's not just a clever name.

1096
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:44,530
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1097
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:49,314
[SPEAKER_04]: The highest average score, you gotta do at least six of these, you get a Wii.

1098
01:05:50,712 --> 01:05:51,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1099
01:05:51,793 --> 01:06:01,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, you have this completely subjective system that you just are going to just kind of pretty much give the system to whoever you think is the funniest.

1100
01:06:02,483 --> 01:06:03,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily the funniest.

1101
01:06:03,764 --> 01:06:05,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever brings the better arguments.

1102
01:06:05,806 --> 01:06:06,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever's the wittiest.

1103
01:06:07,207 --> 01:06:07,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1104
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:07,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, get it?

1105
01:06:07,828 --> 01:06:08,929
[SPEAKER_03]: The wittiest.

1106
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:10,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1107
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:10,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

1108
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:12,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I get points for that?

1109
01:06:12,332 --> 01:06:13,092
[SPEAKER_03]: You got points.

1110
01:06:13,252 --> 01:06:13,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, damn it.

1111
01:06:16,628 --> 01:06:23,133
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody good luck I hope it brings a lot more people into the chat room what do the hosts get out of this?

1112
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:42,531
[SPEAKER_03]: because I notice you've been rating the hosts too you guys just get points for the hell of it you guys just need to ask me and I'll get you stuff you know how that works I want a Wii if you send us a communal Wii we'll fight to the death over it that'll be Orange Lounge Battle Royale we'll tape it and put it on YouTube

1113
01:06:44,748 --> 01:06:45,769
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be on my MySpace profile.

1114
01:06:45,789 --> 01:06:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Nintendo stuff, they've got some new videos of Super Paper Mario on YouTube.

1115
01:06:53,074 --> 01:06:53,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Sexy.

1116
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:56,096
[SPEAKER_02]: From the World Hobby Fair, and they look awesome.

1117
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:56,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me, show me, show me.

1118
01:06:57,477 --> 01:06:58,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's radio, I don't care, show me.

1119
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:00,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen the game come through where I am yet, so.

1120
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1121
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:04,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the Wii yet?

1122
01:07:05,003 --> 01:07:05,283
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1123
01:07:05,783 --> 01:07:06,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, damn.

1124
01:07:06,584 --> 01:07:06,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

1125
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:09,690
[SPEAKER_03]: October dates looking bleaker and bleaker.

1126
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:12,892
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I've heard, and don't quote me on this, it'll probably start in August.

1127
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:15,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well what does that mean if it tests in August?

1128
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean we might still see October?

1129
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:19,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1130
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:22,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how long the DS was in testing.

1131
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,342
[SPEAKER_04]: But, and even if I did, I don't think I'd be at liberty to say.

1132
01:07:28,702 --> 01:07:30,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I don't want you to lose your job.

1133
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:33,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I better have you be quiet.

1134
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:35,826
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, yeah, that's pretty much all I got.

1135
01:07:36,287 --> 01:07:36,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1136
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm gonna let you guys go and finish up your show.

1137
01:07:40,315 --> 01:07:40,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1138
01:07:41,215 --> 01:07:51,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for the contest and encouraging folks to interact with us live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on OrangeLoungeRadio.com because you might win DMN's Wii.

[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you said it.

1141

[SPEAKER_03]: They are gonna win your Wii, right?

01:07:57,965 --> 01:07:58,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1143
01:07:58,526 --> 01:07:58,826

01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:02,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:04,029
[SPEAKER_03]: He rocks.

1150
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:07,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does he give us insider scoop, but he gives stuff away...

1151
01:08:08,277 --> 01:08:09,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because he loves you guys.

1152
01:08:11,018 --> 01:08:12,458
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you guys too, but we got to go.

1153
01:08:12,939 --> 01:08:13,959
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done for tonight.

1154
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:15,119
[SPEAKER_03]: No more show for us.

1155
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:16,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I need ice cream.

1156
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight.

1157
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,201

[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for supporting Internet Radio.

[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you back here next week.

1163
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week is a big show.

1164
01:08:34,773 --> 01:08:35,194
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big show.

1165
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:36,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why next week is a big show?

1166
01:08:36,856 --> 01:08:40,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Because... Because we said so.

1167
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's our birthday.

1168
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:43,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to be this many.

1169
01:08:43,683 --> 01:08:48,649
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be four years old, and I'm hoping somebody brings cake next week.

1170
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,131
[SPEAKER_03]: A chocolate cake.

1171
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:52,614
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a cake in the shape of a cock.

1172
01:08:53,855 --> 01:08:54,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1173
01:08:55,962 --> 01:09:00,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, we'll go let Jamie take out whatever aggression she needs to do right now.

1174
01:09:00,244 --> 01:09:04,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a cake in the shape of a mumbler.
