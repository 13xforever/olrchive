Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,800
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 187 for this June 18th, 2006.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,880
and let's get right back into the news we're going to start it off with the

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,200
Loki has a story about PlayStation 3

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,240
yes don't we always have a story about the PlayStation 3

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,440
well it is newsworthy exactly

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,720
basically now the whole thing coming out with the PlayStation 3 is

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,160
what's it going to be like with retailers

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
am I gonna be able to get one what kind of qualities can we expect

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,640
well according to games first they had a

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:02,080
internal GameStop email, which expressed concern over how many PS3s their chain, which is the

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,420
largest chain out there, including eBay games, would have available.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,800
And a local store that would be receiving between 50 to 100 Xbox 360s at launch, and

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,880
that wasn't very many, is expected to get no more than 20 PS3s.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,880
So if this is true, that's going to suck.

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,200
Or it's not going to matter because people won't be buying them.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,000
But I know I was going to say, I don't want to be a jerk, I don't want to be the anti-Sony

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,980
guy because I'm really trying to give everybody a fair shot here even if I'm being constantly

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,840
disappointed over there, but is it realistic that there's going to be as many people that

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,920
want the PlayStation 3 S1 and Xbox 360?

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,260
That's the thing, I think there will be a lot of people wanting it, but I'm not sure.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,420
It will still be a clusterfuck like the 360 launch was, I think.

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,380
I don't think that they're going to be having trouble selling those 20 units.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,660
That's why I think it's going to be a problem, though.

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,300
But those 20 units are just going to end up on Craigslist, eBay, etcetera?

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Yeah, they will.

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,780
Because people learned that they can do that.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,180
Sad, sad, sad.

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,460
Any way that we can dodge this or is this just brace yourselves, get your pre-orders

33
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,020
in ASAP as soon as they'll start taking them or have a game plan if you really want this?

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Pretty much, yeah.

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
All right, heads up.

36
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,300
Hope you learned from the Xbox 360 experience.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,220
Moving on to a completely different topic, well, it does have to do with the next generation

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,260
of gaming, but it's an old game, very, very old game, making its way into the next generation

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
of gaming.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,260
Yes, Jamie?

41
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,940
This makes my heart happy.

42
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,860
what one of the number one favorite games in my house is that would be

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,140
Dragon's Lair okay which I have the Sega CD version I have it on an arcade

44
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,660
emulator I have it on our two copies on DVD what is it about the game that you

45
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,060
love so much because honestly if you just memorize the that doesn't matter

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,860
it's Don Bluth animation it's just so cool and it's neat watching all the

47
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,820
different ways he turns into a skeleton and dies and you know and on top of that

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,020
It's just really fun.

49
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,140
Digital Leisure is bringing it out in high definition

50
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,580
for the PC.

51
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,180
Oh, for the PC.

52
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,720
Which means that I'm basically going

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,420
to be hooking it up through my laptop to our 50-inch widescreen

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,820
and playing the hell out of it.

55
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,180
That's going to be kind of cool.

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,580
So imagine how that's going to look on my TV.

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,340
But wait a minute.

58
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,220
These cartoons were made in 83 or something, right?

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,820
It's still awesome.

60
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,100
Is it really going to look that much different in HD?

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,780
Or what are they going to do?

62
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,440
Are they going to redo it or anything?

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,260
they're basically taking the original

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,100
footage from what I understand and redoing it for high definition.

65
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,620
Well, that might be cool.

66
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,300
But, imagine, you know, the first...

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,660
when it first came out, it was on laserdisc.

68
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,200
So, it was the cleanest thing out there,

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,620
you know, in the eighties as far as its, you know, resolution. I mean, it was cleaner than

70
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,300
almost anything that you'd get at your house,

71
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,660
you know, for any type of animation. So,

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,860
by that respect, you know, I'm actually pretty, pretty excited about this.

73
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,860
and also they're going to be following up with Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.

74
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Time warp!

75
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Interesting thought there from Xander K. in our chatroom. Dragon's Lair for

76
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,860
Xbox Live Arcade, Xander says. I don't know. It might be a little big.

77
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,860
To do it justice, it would really be too big. You could port over the Commodore 64

78
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,860
version, which I had. It wasn't that bad.

79
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,860
For Commodore 64, it wasn't that bad a game. It had good music.

80
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,540
music. They had to remove a ton of scenes out of the Sega CD version just to get it to fit.

81
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,900
It's grainier than hell. I mean, now that's though, keep in mind, I think a CD is what,

82
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:55,780
700 megabytes? How big is your average Xbox arcade game? Probably, what, 40, 50 megs?

83
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,940
I think it's 50 megs because they have to keep it under the size of the memory card.

84
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:09,300
So you've got it so a 700 meg game versus you know that's also not count

85
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,840
you know we have to include audio with that you know I'm sure compressive

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,780
compression technology is a lot better now than it was then but still think you

87
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,540
know keep that in mind we're talking about full solid animation I doubt that

88
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,740
it's gonna really be able to pull out well at least in and maintain proper

89
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,880
resolution gs-191 in our chat room orange launch radio.com click on chat

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,400
says sky they're going back to old 30s and 40s movies and remastering them in

91
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,060
HD and they look damn good to boot okay I'm one of I have seen some of the old

92
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,480
movies on the HD channels we have here and they look pretty good I mean they

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,720
still look dated but I okay I'm willing to give it a fair shot don't get me

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,080
wrong I do enjoy dragons lair it's it's it's a neat I just love the concept and

95
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,240
you know it's a very unique type of game also in the next few weeks keep your eye

96
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,240
on our stuff at stuff.orangelandradio.com, our blog, for a review.

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Oh, someone's getting the hookup.

98
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Someone is.

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Sweet. Now, also our chat room brings up, I want to say it was VX JasonXV, Dark Knight, somebody over there was talking about Space Ace.

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
So if we get success with Dragon's Lair.

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
They did Space Ace.

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Oh, they're going to do Space Ace HD and all that good stuff?

103
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,240
They said it. It was actually the next one out should be Space Ace, and let me double check it once more.

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Yeah, that'd be kind of cool.

105
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,440
Next out Space Ace HD and Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp.

106
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,040
Wow. They actually had a Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp in a local arcade here

107
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,360
not that long ago. And it was broken. Oh, that's sad. It worked at one point.

108
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,440
I so would have bought that. Oh, you know we got another pinball.

109
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Again? We got a whodunnit. You guys are nuts.

110
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,360
Yeah. Speaking of taking old games and making them new all over again,

111
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,360
the Xbox 360 got a backwards compatibility update this week and

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,560
I want to say 21 new games are playable, I think seven more in Japan, so you get 28 if you're Japan.

113
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,600
But 21 new games are now playable, Amp 2, Doom 3, Fatal Frame,

114
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,120
Silent Hill 4, Lego Star Wars, Minority Report,

115
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,660
Spider-Man, Spawn Armageddon, Star Wars Battlefront, The Punisher,

116
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,200
just to name a few on the list there. If you want to see the full list, head on over to Xbox.com.

117
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
They've updated their backwards compatibility list

118
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,840
I will say I did pop in my copy of Silent Hill for the room just to kind of check out see what it looked like

119
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,120
It looked really clean like it does look better than it does on the Xbox. I don't I don't know what it is about it

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,400
I don't know if the software is uprising it or something, but the game looked pretty nice

121
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,360
It doesn't look 360 game quality, but it's definitely a little bitty baby step up from the Xbox

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,640
So I was pretty impressed. I am kind of sad though that still it's not

123
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,140
Most of my collection I still cannot play on the 360.

124
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
The majority of it I still can't play.

125
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,140
I don't know how long it'll take before we can play more of them.

126
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140
Do you think they're going to keep going?

127
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,140
I heard Peter Moore took back what he had said last week and all that stuff.

128
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Do you think they're going to go back and really take an effort to make all

129
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,140
or at least all of the top 100 best selling games playable?

130
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,440
Or do you think this is something that slowly is going to phase out and xbox or Microsoft's just going to try and

131
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,340
You know try to give us new stuff to make us forget about this whole

132
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,660
kind of

133
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,820
Mistake of not having these backwards compatibility games sooner

134
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,660
I think it's gonna be probably just sticking with this kind of rate where there's like a

135
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,460
few games every month I

136
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,420
Wish I wish they would just kind of release the patch as they get new ones even if it's just four or five why not?

137
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,420
put out the patch you know but maybe they just I don't know maybe it's too much for

138
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,620
their servers or something something technical I'm not thinking of I don't know well I mean

139
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,460
the update was automatic I remember that Chinese update that was the backwards compatibility

140
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,100
as well well but that's important if you're in China but I'm not so I don't care well

141
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,860
but I don't know I don't know maybe they have to patch them all at once I don't know who

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:12,220
knows anyway Microsoft's making a lot of interesting statements this week yes Loki well sorta yeah

143
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,420
Yeah, I mean, it's somebody on their development staff.

144
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:22,420
But anyways, Microsoft's Matt Lee, a developer in Microsoft's Game Technology Group said,

145
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:29,540
and I quote, Japan's not necessarily the most important market for gaming these days, adding,

146
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,820
it's also not quite as large as the U.S. and European markets.

147
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,740
That's hilarious.

148
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,860
And I think everybody out there, well Nintendo's doing a good job of not saying anything.

149
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:52,500
I think that unless you're the PR guy at Microsoft or you're the PR guy over at Sony, you should

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,980
probably shut the hell up about everything because you're just digging yourself into

151
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
a hole.

152
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,840
That's a really weird thing to say.

153
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,080
I understand that Microsoft is kind of struggling in Japan because I was looking at some sales

154
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,600
numbers and you know even the ps2 is still well hell even here though the ps2

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,560
what outsold earnings but of course the ps2 got a price cut last month to it

156
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,640
outsold 360 earnings money it's not that important market share not that

157
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:27,160
important you know stock prices not that important okay it's important is what

158
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,940
color our consoles come in that's damn important I don't know dark soccer what

159
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,140
What do you think about that statement, the whole Japan is not that important?

160
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,140
That's utter crap.

161
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,900
I mean, think about it, it's not just a big market for the fact that there are people

162
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,780
who stand in line for new releases of games, who basically are stalkerish over voice actors

163
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,180
for games, you know, we're importing games from there because they're better than what

164
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,260
we have here, you know, that's just complete and utter crap to say that the market is just

165
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,420
not as important is the fact that they are not properly catering to that market.

166
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,080
Do you think that we might have a biased perspective being that the background on this program

167
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,300
we've always kind of been fans kind of geared towards that Japanese import audience or kind

168
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,500
of more of the games we play, but in the bigger picture...

169
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,020
I'm referring over just to the social side that games have.

170
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:31,980
I look at our, you know, the fanbase for a lot of these games is a lot bigger than, you

171
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,240
know, of course it is here, because here to us it's niche, but to, you know, to a lot

172
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,180
of the fandom groups there, I mean, there's a lot bigger crowd, I think.

173
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,140
You know, you've got those people that are going to stand in line for, you know, a new

174
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,500
RPG, you know, where we have the Madden crowds are just a few people at a time, pretty much.

175
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
It may be a busier sales day, but you don't have people just hanging out in lines outside

176
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,060
of stores or going to meet so-and-so voice actor who was in this game.

177
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,980
That doesn't happen here.

178
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,140
Games are not just the fact that there's a big market for it.

179
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,780
It's a big social thing too, a lot bigger than it is here, and that's just in general.

180
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
For us, it's niche.

181
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,860
Over there, it's a lot bigger.

182
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,880
Let's talk about something that's going on in Japan and other companies doing something

183
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
special over there.

184
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,920
It's Sony and Jamie you'll like this.

185
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,100
There's a LocoRoco bundle coming out in Japan.

186
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,240
Sony is basically going to be celebrating the release of LocoRoco by putting together

187
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,000
a hardware bundle that will have the game and the PSP unit in either white or black.

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,200
So all together that's PSP unit, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 meg card and LocoRoco.

189
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,360
It's all packaged together in a special box and it comes out July 13th for 24,800 yen.

190
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,920
Also has a special LocoRoco case that goes with it.

191
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Didn't I say that?

192
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,560
I have the special Katamari case.

193
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Oh.

194
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,920
What do you think?

195
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Cool?

196
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Worth importing?

197
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,500
Well, I guess you already have a PSP so maybe not.

198
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,560
It's cool, I mean, but honestly, I've already got a PSP.

199
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
I just care about the game.

200
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
That's still kind of neat though.

201
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,720
And I already have a cool case running because Dan got me the one that came out with me and

202
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,320
Katamari. Which I don't have. Well, for those of you guys that love to import things, maybe

203
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,480
there will be something there. Uh, darks! Oh, yeah. Just like getting all the stuff

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,660
that came with Poppin' Music 11 to get in teacups and towels. They get some crazy collector

205
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,640
editions in Japan. Actually, what I have, I have on Dreamcast, I have the Cardcaptor

206
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Sakura game that came with a pillow case, a plate, a spoon, a fork, and um, a clock.

207
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:47,600
a clock a wall clock Wow and would you actually use any of that stuff or is it

208
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,040
just collector stuff it's collector stuff although I might put the clock up

209
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,640
when we make my art room oh cool I love my card capture Sakura o'clock

210
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,400
dark Sakura take us to our next story a bunch of stuff happened okay actually

211
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,160
very descriptive thank you there was an article for the question of the week on

212
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:16,100
a Gama Sutra about an interview with Chris Crawford. Basically there was he

213
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,280
was the creator of Balance of Power. He was basically saying new ideas don't go

214
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,040
anywhere so the industry is just rehashing the same stuff over and over

215
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,380
again. There's nothing inherently wrong with recycling the same thing over and

216
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,340
over and over but how do you know what you're missing if you're not trying? Has

217
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,500
anyone noticed that we don't appeal to the general public? Well that's a quote

218
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,240
from him so there's a new question now that's on their question of the week

219
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,060
page and I'll get an article the link to that momentarily but it's what examples

220
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,460
of innovation in design business or other areas do you think disprove the

221
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,860
notion that the game industry is not evolving as quickly as it should be or

222
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,180
is Chris Crawford right so that's actually pretty interesting I think you

223
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,860
know being that I've always thought that innovation you know needs to happen in

224
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,100
in games I think that we need to be seeing

225
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,100
more that so I'm the actual article if you go on to you

226
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,100
a gama sutures website I'm

227
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,460
it's a well got a pretty big URL just look for the June 14 story

228
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,780
they'll be a link to that I would actually like to see some of our people

229
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,340
you know some of our listeners I should say you know respond to that cuz

230
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,300
you know actually I'm actually curious myself actually you know since e-mail to

231
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:35,280
Mailbag at orange on radio comm because I'd actually like to to air some of the same responses here on the show, too. I

232
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,240
Guess we'll see two more to come then on that. Yeah all the feedback thing

233
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,500
I think that that's a pretty good question. I'm trying to see if there's any response there in our chat room

234
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,860
They're still all over at orange on twitter.com. Click on chat. They're still all consumed there with the card captor Sakura

235
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,340
Pack that you have there dark. Okay, I'll put pictures of it up on our site

236
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,020
Okay, dark Tetsuya says here's a comment relating to that dark Tetsuya says well, what's more innovative than the Wii?

237
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,900
Interesting

238
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,180
We just we just getting a lot of brownie points for being innovative a very innovative system

239
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,540
I think I say you write that down send that in dark Tetsuya

240
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Moving on Loki

241
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,260
Nintendo speaking of the Wii what's Nintendo up to well Nintendo has a new

242
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,380
Club Nintendo, which is I guess a brand new website that they're launching that you can

243
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:37,720
get a ton of really exclusive Nintendo stuff. I mean, everything they've got, for example,

244
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,480
some different notebooks, you can get tape that have Animal Crossing characters on it.

245
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:52,140
You've got these other folders that have Mario stuff on there.

246
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,520
Some of my favorites, they have a DS case that holds 9 different styluses, all different

247
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,180
colors of the rainbow, and 9 games that's available.

248
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,240
Also some multicolored DS Lite cases.

249
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,840
You've got a Mario kind of like a bookshelf for your Nintendo DS games, and then probably

250
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,540
the best thing out of all of them on there, an exclusive Nintendo DS game, the Game & Watch

251
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,660
Collection, where you can play Game & Watch games on your DS.

252
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,660
Happy!

253
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,020
Allow me to be the first to say, Game & Watch games sucked, why would I want this?

254
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
Ah, Game & Watch!

255
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,020
It's just...

256
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,020
Outside of nostalgia value.

257
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,300
They totally kicked the ass with Tiger Toys.

258
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,820
I guess, I don't know.

259
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,580
Japan only unfortunately but if you're wanting to check it out it's ah you know

260
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,100
that shit will show up on eBay club that Nintendo jet JP slash new underscore

261
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:58,860
present and there you go all right moving on to another story speaking of

262
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,900
the Wii as well dark soccer has a story relating to the Wii yeah I sure do so

263
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,580
who's a fan of Call of Duty 3 all five people I am it's a hugely successful

264
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,220
game maybe not in this room yeah I love call D I'm gonna be honest never played

265
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,940
it it's just not one out of three orange gel posts agree Call of Duty is top

266
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,900
notch I mean it's just I'm so burned out on the war sim it's just not my enemy

267
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,100
you should borrow mine it should but it's just not my cup fine I will borrow

268
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,260
it and give it a champ but it's just not really my kind of game I just well we've

269
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,560
got I got plenty other crap to play we've got details for call it I said

270
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,560
We've got details for Call of Duty, Call of Booty, Call of Booty, there should be a new

271
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
name called Call of Duty.

272
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,280
Wow, lots of Call of Duty fans everywhere, just got offended about five times in the

273
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
past 60 seconds.

274
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,680
Listen, Call of Duty, you know if you're going to be calling in like, Duty, that was last

275
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
week's show.

276
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Okay.

277
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Call of Duty.

278
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Anyway.

279
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Yes, Call of Duty 3.

280
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,800
So there's details on the Wii version of Call of Duty 3, which I don't know how that's going

281
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:12,680
work out but at any rate they're basically working on having it they

282
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,180
actually don't have a release date scheduled for the we release but they

283
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,520
are going to say it's going to be released this year speculation is

284
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:28,240
pointing out November around Thanksgiving there hasn't been any real

285
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,680
gameplay I think they're saying though that they're what they're working on is

286
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,680
is actually using the Wii remote for position-pointing for that type of thing.

287
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,680
That's pretty good. It doesn't sound like they're very far along and they're going to have that thing out at the end of the year?

288
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
That's pretty aggressive.

289
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
I'd say so.

290
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,680
I'd be alarmed at that. I mean, no matter what type of game it is, if they're still kind of early on here

291
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
and they're trying to get that out by the end of the year.

292
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,680
But they're basically saying that they're going to center the reticule on the screen so that you use the controller.

293
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Huh. Innovative idea. Different, but...

294
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,680
It sounds very similar to Red Steel.

295
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,680
The way they move from that.

296
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Alright. Interesting.

297
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Then we shall move on, yes? Let's! Alright. Tomb Raider

298
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,680
was going to be remade for the PSP, but then there was an announcement

299
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,680
on Core Design's website that said it was cancelled.

300
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,980
The video of Tomb Raider 10th Anniversary that appeared on certain sites was an unauthorized

301
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,700
release of an internal presentation of a game that was being developed by Core Design until

302
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,940
very recently.

303
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,220
It was running on PSP and used Core Developed Engine, however following a recent review

304
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,920
this project has been officially cancelled by SCI.

305
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,020
But is Tomb Raider really cancelled?

306
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,660
Because Eurogamer came out and said no, the remake isn't cancelled, SCI just issued a

307
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,540
new statement saying that hey it's back on.

308
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,140
So apparently not only are you going to be able to download Tomb Raider through this

309
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,160
whole PSP download to Playstation 1 games thing, but now there's going to be an official

310
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,220
remake on the PSP.

311
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,420
Much like there was for Twisted Metal 2, I mean Twisted Metal, whatever the hell it's

312
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,820
called, I had that game too, and very disappointing, a launch game that's actually a rehash of

313
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
an old game.

314
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Hmm.

315
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Interesting.

316
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,460
I'm kind of burned out on Tomb Raider.

317
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,620
Tomb Raider was cool like many years ago when it was on the PC and it was like cutting edge

318
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
at the time.

319
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,380
I don't know how excited I would be about a remake.

320
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,180
I was not a fan of the Xbox 360 one, the recent one that just came out and I got my hands

321
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,500
on just wasn't for me.

322
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:47,840
Loki, speaking of upgrades of old games, yeah, Final Fantasy VII, we've seen websites taking

323
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,580
pre-orders for it and well Squares come out and of course said Final Fantasy 7 Remake

324
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:03,920
on Playstation 3 basically that they we haven't confirmed that's in development but we have

325
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:11,320
confirmed that Final Fantasy 13 is in development and so far there's no they are not working

326
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,160
on any Final Fantasy 7 Remake will it happen probably so they didn't say no they didn't

327
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,460
say no, they're just not working on it. They just said, we haven't said it. Yeah. And fanboys

328
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,240
everywhere still have hope. And it's basically, we have not confirmed the Final Fantasy remake

329
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,760
at any time. So, we haven't confirmed it, but we didn't say no. Maybe we're doing it,

330
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:39,760
and maybe we're not. I'm not gonna tell you. They're doing it, okay? That's just, ugh,

331
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,360
they're doing it. Well. That's my theory. They're doing it. If they did it, would anyone

332
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,120
They're doing Final Fantasy everything else, why not?

333
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,400
Tweak in our chatroom says Final Fantasy VII was good, but it's time to move on, people!

334
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,600
I wouldn't mind it looking pretty.

335
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,480
Jaded2006 seems to think they will move on after one more thing with the Final Fantasy

336
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
VII franchise.

337
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,200
I think it would be cool to see them remake VI.

338
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
That would be cool.

339
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
That would be cool.

340
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
I'd like to see them go back and do IV, VI.

341
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,320
I can find something cool.

342
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,200
On YouTube, I found the Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy VI demo.

343
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,280
Oh, yeah, you brought this up on a previous show before.

344
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I've been looking and looking and looking, and finally I was like, let me look on YouTube, and the whole thing's there.

345
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,780
Because everything's on YouTube.

346
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
But, um...

347
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,280
So I'm in a video on YouTube somewhere, randomly.

348
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,780
I honestly, though, do wish that they would remake Final Fantasy VII, not for PlayStation 3, but, you know...

349
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,780
I mean, they're gonna if they do, but...

350
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:38,280
I want them to leave it the same, except I want them to put back in the quest that was edited out on the Japanese version to bring back stupid Hobag.

351
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Even though you don't like her.

352
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Because she was freaking useful!

353
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,280
her thing was useful the great gospel

354
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,720
but she sucks so I wouldn't really have to use her

355
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
but you just would be happy she's there yeah there was basically a whole side

356
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,800
quest where if you use like

357
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,600
a game basically this edited out code is what it is you can run through this quest where you

358
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,560
pick up all the stuff

359
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,260
then you go back into the church and you see her there and actually on the

360
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,920
American version you see her there but when you walk forward she just disappears

361
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,460
that's actually bad coding weird yeah

362
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,500
The whole quest is on the Japanese one.

363
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,340
Alright, well since we're talking about Final Fantasy VII and then we're talking about remakes

364
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,620
that may or may not happen, that starts to make us a little angry, what better time for

365
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,140
us to bring on the FUs of the week.

366
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,700
It's the segment for us to get a load off our chest for a minute here about what's making

367
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,100
us mad this week.

368
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,540
Maybe it's the games, maybe it's not.

369
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
Who cares?

370
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
We're ranting.

371
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:47,120
My FU of the week goes toward life forms on Interstate 5.

372
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,100
As in all of the bug death that was all over my car that the car wash would not wash off

373
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,980
and I had to do it by hand.

374
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,700
And the stupid hoe bags that, I swear, and you know, and I can actually say this because

375
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:06,140
I am female stupid women drivers okay this I'm getting back on the freeway

376
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:12,300
after stopping at at a truck stop and I'm changing lanes that's going to get

377
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,100
in my lane start to accelerate and this other woman and her children some type

378
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,220
of breeder cow lady was behind a semi and it cuts me off to get in front of me

379
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,780
and then she's like finally I just got her out of my way shot past her

380
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,460
couldn't deal with that but like she almost clipped the front of my car and

381
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,540
then another stupid lady on the way home in an SUV ha ha ha decides that she's

382
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,060
gonna cut me no she's gonna tailgate me for 10 minutes and I mean literally I

383
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:46,060
even put on my brakes you know almost bumped me it was crazy and then she just

384
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,080
shoots past me so finally I said you know screw it nobody else is on the road

385
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,060
I got in front of her and speed matched a semi she turned on her brights now

386
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,300
keep in mind she's in an SUV I drive a Lancer I am under her lights and I'm

387
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,320
short I didn't care plus I have tinted windows do you think that her bright

388
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,160
lights are really gonna mean a damn thing to me you're a bitch I timed it

389
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,680
for exactly 20 minutes I speed matched a semi and then I drove up Wow and then

390
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,500
she tried to pass me and then I caught up with her again and speed matched

391
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,200
another semi for 10 minutes and then kept going there's a special place in

392
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,400
hell for people like you I'm sorry you don't tailgate people on the freeway

393
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,480
first of all it's dangerous oh and you know what she was also in her cell phone

394
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,080
she was on her damn cell phone three things I hate is stupid drivers people

395
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,120
driving a TV stupidly and talking on your goddamn cell phone while you're

396
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,660
driving no there is a special place in hell for people like her and you're

397
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,180
right it's where they have these 20 cell phones around them and none of them work

398
00:26:53,180 --> 00:27:00,980
but they're all rings and they're all ringing with the singular ringtone yeah

399
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,480
so I was like so mad and keep in mind I this is at this time I had been on the

400
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,060
road for 10 hours to give this a background of this a friend of mine was

401
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,860
in San Diego for convention got really sick so we drove down to meet her in

402
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,660
Baker's field and then drove back which is like a five-hour drive from here and

403
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,460
then I had to drive back so it was just really and I just was driving back by

404
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,300
myself at this point I was so worn out and pissed off at the world that I was

405
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,900
like you know what I'm going to take out all of my road frustrations and I did it

406
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:39,700
in a completely safe way I did not do it by speeding tailgating or in other ways

407
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:46,700
is driving unsafely, I just drove slowly, speed matching a semi. Alright, I got my revenge,

408
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:56,020
power to me! We gotta keep it moving. Uh, Loki, I don't know how I can really follow

409
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,340
that. I know. She touched all the key points about women drivers. I however am an excellent

410
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,840
driver. Yes, because you know pacing cars and you know getting revenge against drivers

411
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,840
I was driving safely. I didn't speed, she just couldn't get around me. She was speeding,

412
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:23,040
she was doing 100. I was saving everybody else. Alright kids, stop fighting. Anyways,

413
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,680
I don't really have an FQ of the week, but I'd like to point out an observation. I went

414
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,980
to the drag races this weekend. My god, a lot of rednecks like drag racing. I mean I

415
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,540
swear to god about half the people there didn't have shirts on, had tattoos, and drank in

416
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:42,620
their beer with their kids, but you know what though? Jet cars are awesome, and that makes

417
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,660
it worth it. It appeals to the redneck in me, just watching a car go 260 miles an hour

418
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:56,940
down a quarter mile. My FU of the week goes to Light Rail and some of the people that

419
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,460
ride it. I had jury duty this week, which I had for like the past two and a half weeks,

420
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,100
which finally ended this week, thank you, it's over. It's an important civic duty though,

421
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,180
You know, if you're in America, if it's not going to disrupt your schedule, you're not

422
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,020
in school or whatever, and your work will compensate for you being there, I say go.

423
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,060
It's a really great educational experience.

424
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:23,260
But don't ride the light rail to the courthouse because there are some just rude people that

425
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
ride it.

426
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
Oh my gosh.

427
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
And silly people.

428
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,980
Yeah, all of it.

429
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
All of it.

430
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
So F you the light rail.

431
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,380
Actually, if I may, Rob, do you have an addendum?

432
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
Sure.

433
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,340
I did actually speed up when I saw somebody else's lights behind her.

434
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Alright.

435
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Is chat room giving you a little crap for your story, DarkSakura?

436
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
I don't know.

437
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
I saw some folks cheering you on.

438
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
No, I'm actually getting kudos so far.

439
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Yeah, I saw some folks cheering you on there.

440
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
Alright, uh...

441
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,340
I just want to say I was only punishing her and nobody else.

442
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
Alright.

443
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Loki, we had a story on backwards compatibility earlier and you have somewhat of a footnote

444
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
to that story.

445
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Yes.

446
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,620
A certain someone named Tim Schafer is a little pissed off that his game Psychonauts isn't

447
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:11,080
backwards compatible on the 360, and he's basically offered up the fly down his team

448
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:19,680
to help it make it happen, but Microsoft assured him, as well as everybody else, that they're

449
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
on top of it.

450
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:27,440
They've got their top men on the job, so he's not too happy about that, as well as fans

451
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,660
of Psychonauts, and will you be seeing Psychonauts on the 360 anytime soon?

452
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,060
but probably not

453
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,020
maybe in the next update which at the going rate will be in about four months

454
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,140
about maybe

455
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,060
uh... as long as they get crusty demons to work on there because that looks funny

456
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,280
ooh that and be

457
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,380
wait BMX triple x was censored on uh...

458
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,220
the xbox I have no idea what system do we do we play it on because you used to have it

459
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,540
I had it on the gamecube

460
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,940
that's kind of a weird system to that my sister and her um... boyfriend are borrowing it

461
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Indefinite fun fun ah

462
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,620
Dark Sakura there was a movie at the box office or a movie that did pretty well the box office this week

463
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,660
And maybe it'll be a game now. You know what um and actually I haven't been to see it

464
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,740
I really want to you, but nacho libre

465
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,020
Has been licensed by Majesco

466
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
What is Majesco done lately?

467
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,060
I'm not sure

468
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,100
To be honest, maybe their Wikipedia would clue us into that. I'm assuming

469
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:38,540
It has all this useless stuff on it. Well, they're basically the game's gonna be done by bud cat creations. They brought out

470
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,540
psychonauts and Madden NFL 2006

471
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,580
But this is gonna be from what I'm saying, it's gonna be on the Nintendo DS

472
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,900
It's going to be the first Nintendo DS games on the US and European market

473
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:00,260
so we will have natural debris and there's also a mention that they're

474
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,100
trying to obtain the right to the ghostwriter movie but I think take 2 got

475
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,580
it instead you know speaking of I played that ghostwriter game at e3 and it's

476
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,780
god-awful they should have given it to somebody else I'm sorry it was awful

477
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,860
speaking of games and movies I completely forgot Silent Hill the movie

478
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:23,020
is actually coming to DVD August 22nd in the United States so look forward to

479
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:30,020
that. They're gonna have some DVD commentaries on there, plus the origins of Silent Hill

480
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:35,660
and some other stuff. No UFO ending! It better have a UFO ending as an easter egg, or the

481
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:41,700
dog. I want a UFO ending on it. Well, want all you want, it's not gonna happen. You don't

482
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,420
know that. It's just like wanting the Battle Royale US movie to be good. It could be an

483
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:52,540
easter egg. Oh, hello, how could we forget Majesco Guilty Gear. Yeah, that was it. I

484
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
They did something I like.

485
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,540
The Jaws game was recent too.

486
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
I love Guilty Gear.

487
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:03,540
Infected was also a big push from them not that long ago.

488
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,540
I need to go see Nacho Libre though.

489
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
I'll pass.

490
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,540
I am a big fan of Mexican wrestling.

491
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,540
Yes, but are you a big fan of Jack Black?

492
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,540
Not too much, but I still think this is going to be hilarious.

493
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,540
I was when he was in Tenacious D. Do they even still do stuff now?

494
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
I don't know.

495
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
They're making a Tenacious D movie.

496
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:30,220
We've had a lot of politically oriented stories in the first half of the show and this kind

497
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:39,380
of follows that the ESRB is now threatening $1 million game rating fines.

498
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:46,040
The ESRB is raising this maximum penalty for a publisher who fails to disclose objectional

499
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:52,520
content so don't leave your nudity on the disc because some hacker might find it and

500
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,800
your company is going to get sued for one million.

501
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,640
Here's my question though, I know how they have their rating system and stuff.

502
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:08,160
Now I for fact know that anime, like ADV for example, they do not have ratings that are

503
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,400
done by the MPAA.

504
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,160
They have their own ratings that they put on there that are completely independent and

505
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,240
And yet they are sold in stores out there that are not banning them.

506
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,760
Who gives a crap if they get sued a million dollars?

507
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,120
Couldn't they self-rate their games and still be able to put them out in the stores?

508
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,480
Well, how I was going to get to that is that the ESRB, you might be asking, well what happens

509
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,040
if they don't pay the one million dollars?

510
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,120
What the ESRB can do is revoke the rating services and that will screw you when it comes

511
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,160
to getting into Walmart and GameStop and all that stuff, which doesn't carry games and

512
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,280
aren't branded.

513
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,600
or have the AO rating, I should point out.

514
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,920
I don't know, you raise a good point, but at the same time, with the video games getting

515
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,680
all this negative publicity in the sense of these laws, I don't know if a video game company

516
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,080
would be able to get away with it the same way a movie company can.

517
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
I don't see...

518
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
I mean, because they're rated...

519
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
I don't...

520
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Anime is kind of its own...

521
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,160
I mean, in the sense that movies is kind of its own specialty world anyway.

522
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Yeah, but the ESRB...

523
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Maybe that's how they get away with it.

524
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,520
The ESRB is like kind of an independent company anyways.

525
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,660
Why do they have to be the one out there that says what the game is rated?

526
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,100
Couldn't there be another rating system out there?

527
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,700
Does it really need to be this one company?

528
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,760
If you think about it, they're putting these companies through a lot of stupid shit.

529
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,100
The whole hot coffee thing was ridiculous to begin with, and the fact that they're threatening

530
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,740
$1,000,000 fines, $1,000,000 for what?

531
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,560
Oh, that's going to teach them to not go with you?

532
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Big deal.

533
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
It's an independent company.

534
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,480
don't see what the big deal is, just self rate your games. That's what we did before

535
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,140
we even had these ESRB things, is they either didn't have a rating or they were self rated,

536
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:56,140
so big deal, I don't know. Alright, uh, Loki, take us to our next story. Speaking of craziness,

537
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:02,480
I swear to god it should be a segment on this show, what crazy thing did Sony say this week?

538
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:12,000
Well uh, Kutaragi, he came out and said, as the Playstation 3 is a computer we might even

539
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,880
offer it on a build to order basis, customized to the needs of each and every user.

540
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,360
Congratulations, you are retarded.

541
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:27,120
So like a gateway Playstation 3 or a Dell PS3?

542
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
So it's like a PC.

543
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
So it's a PC.

544
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Dude, you're getting a PS3.

545
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,440
Great, it's a PC.

546
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,880
Wonderful.

547
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,680
Sony seems to really be working that it's a computer angle.

548
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,560
All that to avoid taxes in the UK.

549
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,360
I don't know.

550
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,520
They don't get it.

551
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,680
Speaking of people in power at companies, did you hear this?

552
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,520
This doesn't maybe directly affect gaming, but it is important to note, nerds everywhere

553
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,400
were noting that Bill Gates has announced that he's stepping down from his head position

554
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,800
at Microsoft in 2008.

555
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,280
And what's going to happen after July of 2008, Gates will kind of function only in like an

556
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,860
advisory role.

557
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,800
He's not going to really be doing the day-to-day functions.

558
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,880
He wants to focus on the charity stuff, which is cool, and it's got him a lot of notoriety

559
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
in recent years.

560
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,480
Wasn't he a papal of the year?

561
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,920
Was it last year, the year before, with his wife and Bono for their charity work?

562
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm surprised he's being able to retire in two years.

563
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,480
Isn't he going to go broke tomorrow?

564
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,520
I somehow doubt that, with all the billions of dollars that he is making, he is going

565
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,520
to be really struggling, he might have to cut back.

566
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,080
Expect to see Ray Ozzie, who is the Chief Technical Officer, start to take on a bigger

567
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,640
role there, not saying he is necessarily going to be a replacement, but he is going to assume

568
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,480
the title of Chief Software Architect and work side by side with Gates on technical

569
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,700
architecture and product oversight responsibilities.

570
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,480
You might start seeing some of those other folks there at Microsoft starting to fill

571
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,860
the shoes of Bill Gates.

572
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,920
One person whose shoes cannot be filled is the great and terrible Dark Sakura.

573
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,220
You can email her or you can email the show really, but she reads them.

574
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
It's no secret.

575
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,560
Dark Sakura is the one that's going through the mailbag there.

576
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,520
It's mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

577
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,560
It's a way for you to interact with our program when you can't be here live on Sunday nights.

578
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,620
when we tape, and DarkSakura reads the emails, she goes through them, puts on her hazmat

579
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,900
suit and her rubber gloves, and pulls out some Anthrax free letters to read for you

580
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
all.

581
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,420
DarkSakura, who is emailing us this week?

582
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:40,540
Well tonight I actually just have three emails.

583
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,600
Yeah because I got one that wasn't really a particularly appropriate question and then

584
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,760
a few others were just site suggestions.

585
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,280
By the way, thank you to our friend Rob with Two Bees.

586
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:57,040
So we have, our first email comes from Matt in the UK, he's really awesome.

587
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,720
I just want to say that your show is awesome.

588
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,760
I just wish that I lived in a different time zone so I can listen to your shows live.

589
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,480
I listen to your podcasts all the time.

590
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,520
I always learn something new when I listen to OLR and you guys always make me laugh.

591
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Thank you.

592
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,860
I wonder if you've ever thought of coming down to the UK sometime.

593
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,080
There's the odd convention going on here and there.

594
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,520
If you do come down here sometime, it would make me the happiest pretty on the isle.

595
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,880
Your show is amazing and I hope you carry on for many years to come.

596
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
I would love to.

597
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,360
In fact, I was planning on going next year.

598
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:35,040
Finances are not what I thought they would be, but who knows, it could happen if we start

599
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
saving our dog.

600
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,200
Anyone buys a plane ticket, we'll go.

601
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,600
No, I appreciate the ego inflation email.

602
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,960
That's always nice to get, but the reality is hundreds of dollars to come over there

603
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,040
Most of the time for it like when I did the East Coast con that came out of my own pocket

604
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,160
If we do sakura con next year, which I'm understanding we've already been

605
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,200
Approved guests or whatever. We're gonna have to pay for that to go there. So

606
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,480
driving our way to if you want to

607
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,920
If you want to help us out with play money sure will come I'd love to check out the UK

608
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,720
I've always wanted to send orange lounge to Britain

609
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
We'll see. We'll see so

610
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,800
someday don't count it out I mean I still want to go there to travel so I

611
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,660
will pay for it someday it's just hopefully Orange Launch Radio is still

612
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,400
around next year and years well I know it will be but you know in when I can

613
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,920
afford it well I got it actually an an non-story email from Rob says this is

614
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,440
just an idea I had but if pin name and we use the we type control scheme

615
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,320
realistic nudges could be modeled for the first time on a home game in those

616
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,560
virtual tables that you talked about last week of course nothing comes

617
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,040
close to a full thrust nudge on a table with no tilt.

618
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,460
Well I don't think it's gotta be pin maim, I think any pinball simulator on the Wii could

619
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,140
incorporate that idea, that's a dang good idea.

620
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:03,140
And then we also have one from, I think in another map, said I just wanted to let you

621
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:14,140
know, let you guys know that on www.ableelectronics.com they have the PS3 available for pre-order.

622
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,600
order the only thing is that you can't really pre-order it instead of the add

623
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,060
to cart button it is replaced with an authorized button which takes you to

624
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,260
nowhere you should check it out go to the website and click on video game

625
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,700
consoles under video games tab I'm sorry buddy but I've never heard of that site

626
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,220
and I would never buy a system from a site I've never dropped $600 on the site

627
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,900
I never heard of but you give a good chance for us to bring up this

628
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,540
opportunity to say don't buy from places that don't know you don't have a trust

629
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:47,620
Again, I don't know this company, so I'm not trying to knock it, but you know, I've never

630
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
heard of it.

631
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
Well, that's why I was thinking of this email.

632
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,820
Whenever you get anything like that, your best friend for any internet ordering place

633
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,200
is the Better Business Bureau website.

634
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,980
Check anything out before you order online, read their feedback, or you could really be

635
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,620
burned and just make sure that you do your research before you go through any of those

636
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620
websites.

637
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
That's why I wanted to bring that email up.

638
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,720
Although it is funny that they're taking pre-orders that go to nowhere.

639
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,720
Maybe it's just something they want to make and it's broken, or I don't know, it's coming soon, who knows?

640
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,820
Could be, under construction. Nobody in chat room is saying anything about that site, so I don't know, we'll see.

641
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Is that it? That'd be all.

642
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,080
Alright, send us more email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

643
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,820
Loki, meanwhile, you want to be a beta tester?

644
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,420
Yes, if you do, then you better head on over to

645
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:47,220
Atari's website, actually they're doing a online beta test for the Playstation 2 version

646
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,780
of their new Test Drive Unlimited.

647
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:58,300
And you can go and sign up right now at www.atari.com slash TDU beta test.

648
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,260
And you can basically sign up there, of course they're saying that you're going to be under

649
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:08,460
a strict non-disclosure agreement or NDA and standard.

650
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,400
You will need to have a PlayStation 2 console, including a broadband internet connection

651
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,060
and network adapter.

652
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:21,180
Alright, so make sure to check that out.

653
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:26,580
I will say though, if I am picked, I will not bite by that indie.

654
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:31,140
They'll sue your ass, careful, I don't know if I'd be admitting to that.

655
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:37,340
Moving on, our Skyplane is going to be opened up very soon over at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

656
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,700
on interact with us, it's username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can call us on the telephone

657
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:48,300
as well, 916-226-9067, please, please, pretty please though, if you're going to call us

658
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:54,900
on Skype, please give these guys a call first, ECHO123, and you don't have to add them to

659
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,480
their friends list, a lot of people told me, well I tried calling you but they wouldn't

660
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,840
accept my friend invite, they're not going to, it's a computer, you just put that in

661
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,160
as your call and it'll pick up right away and you can hear what you sound like, so please

662
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,240
Please give them a call first, make sure you sound good, then give us a call, otherwise

663
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
we get angry.

664
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:17,560
That will be right after this story about the DS Lights on Japanese airline JAL.

665
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,680
They're going to be offering their first class and executive class passengers DS Lights to

666
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,100
play during the flight's duration.

667
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:30,160
It's a special promotion that's going on until August 31st, and if you think you have to

668
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
be in Japan to use this, no.

669
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,980
But actually, the routes would include Tokyo, New York City, Tokyo, Chicago, Tokyo, LA,

670
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:44,740
Tokyo, San Francisco, Tokyo, London, Tokyo, Beijing, and one other one, Tokyo, Guangzhou.

671
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,200
If I horribly butchered that, I'm sorry.

672
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,960
But so if you have JAL going to Tokyo from where you are, chances are you have a chance

673
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,400
to do this.

674
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,900
Of course, the DS Lite's Wi-Fi capabilities have been taken out because you're not supposed

675
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,620
to have wireless and all that stuff interfering on the planes.

676
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,900
However, you will get a chance to do a Japanese brain training game, an English brain training

677
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,700
game, Otona no DS Golf, and Mario Kart.

678
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:19,000
So no snaking on a plane?

679
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,280
You know what, that's got to be one of the worst jokes ever told on this show, congratulations.

680
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,660
I'm full of them, I'll keep them coming, I've been borrowing from 23 Megas.

681
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:35,440

686
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,660
Radio who's this?

687
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,260
Hi Ravens dolphin, what's on your mind buddy?

688
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,620
DS light again. Ah, what's up with the DS light? What are your thoughts on that?

689
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,300
Well, a thousand of them got stolen in Hong Kong. I heard about this

690
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,580
It's all luminous his fault because it told us how to taught us how to move crates. Remember? Yeah, they sure did

691
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,820
What do you what do you think about that? I mean is that I

692
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,580
I think it's crazy. You think it's crazy?

693
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,380
Why? Because somebody was able to get away with it? Stealing all that? Yeah.

694
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,540
Well don't you watch 24? Someone like Jack Bauer can do anything.

695
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,980
Yeah you're right but he's dead. He's not dead.

696
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,380
If he died the show wouldn't continue. Well one of the geeks died and that made me sad.

697
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,000
Alright anyway this is about games. Anything else you want to say about DS Lite?

698
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,500
No but I have a question for you. I'm sorry?

699
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:50,180
I have a question for you. Oh, what? Me? Oh, what? What is the longest loading screen

700
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,800
you ever

701
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,140
encountered in a game?

702
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,060
Of recent memory, Final Fantasy 11. We timed it. It takes one minute 59 seconds

703
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,020
to get from boot up

704
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,580
into the actual game. And that may not sound like a long time, but it is.

705
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,420
UltraMix 3 also had a pretty horrible load time. It takes like a minute

706
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,940
to get in there after the title screen. It's pretty bad. Any of the KOF games on

707
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,500
Saturn?

708
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,600
mm-hmm I Grand Theft Auto's got a pretty bad one oblivion does too but I can

709
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,340
understand an oblivion's case because once you get in there it's pretty good

710
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,800
actually Street Fighter alpha on the Super Nintendo had loading time mm-hmm

711
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,000
really yes it did it was horrible you'd go to this it should like the scene and

712
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,600
then character would pop up after like 30 minutes and then not 30 minutes 30

713
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,240
seconds then another character would pop up and then the voice would load in and

714
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,320
then it would start our chat rooms taking an opportunity one more thing oh

715
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,140
Oh sure. I have a custom-built Super Nintendo controller

716
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,400
that is custom made for a computer. Where'd you get this? Is this something you did

717
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,760
yourself? I ordered it.

718
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,120
Huh? I ordered it online on eBay.

719
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,720
Oh. How's it work? Great. Works perfectly.

720
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,880
Is it just using a bunch of different converters? No, it's a Super Nintendo controller

721
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,680
that is USB interface and it works great with all emulators.

722
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,280
and you got this on ebay

723
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,180
on ebay do you remember the seller's name

724
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,440
so you can recommend it

725
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,040
no i don't know that

726
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,160
the the website this guy makes all of them he even made a power glove

727
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,280
computer one wow well do you remember though um...

728
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,200
the people who made the uh...

729
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,620
uh... pc out of the nintendo

730
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,720
i remember someone did an atari one

731
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,440
well they actually the site's gone now but he was actually building them

732
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,360
for people in selling and he was making the controller into a USB and also converting

733
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,800
the Super Nintendo mouse into a PC mouse.

734
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,720
Oh yeah, they do have that on, I did see that, the mouse one, I want to buy it, it was like

735
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,720
24 bucks.

736
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:53,040
But he was building it basically out of laptop parts and just putting a USB connector instead

737
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,320
of the regular plug-in and setting up drivers for it.

738
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
Oh, sounds interesting.

739
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,280
Ravenstaufen, I want to point out as well, the chat room is giving quite a response to

740
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,840
your question about load times i hit stun saying half-life 2 takes me

741
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,040
forever to load you will bow to me says midnight club dub for PSP has hella load

742
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,900
times

743
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:18,660
yeah i agree xander k says the sims 2 for PSP has the crappiest loads ever

744
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,200
wow i didn't expect such a response to this well it was just a random question

745
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,520
see how easy it is to get a response out of people just get on a microphone and

746
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,360
start yelling

747
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,400

Thanks for the call.

751
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,400
Bye.

Later.

753
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Let's go to another call.

754
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Hi.

755
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

756
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,400
Who's this?

757
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,400
It's Diginova.

758
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Hi, Diginova.

759
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Hey.

760
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
How you doing?

761
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,840
Just letting you know it's sunrise here at the moment.

762
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,840
Oh, my God.

763
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,640
What time is it over there?

764
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,840
It's 4.30 in the morning.

765
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,680
I can tell where you're from from the sound of your voice.

766
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
That's wow.

767
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,680
He's so tired.

768
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,440
Well, I was going to go to bed at midnight, but I asked my fiancé, could I please just

769
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,960
stay up and listen to you guys because I've got the time off because I've just changed jobs.

770
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,320
Oh, thank you fiance for us. And thank you for being so dedicated. You're crazy. I love it.

771
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,080
What's on your mind? What do you want to share with listeners?

772
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,480
It was actually two points. First of all,

773
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,960
make it quick because I know you guys got other people calling. It was,

774
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:21,200
I was watching the TV show called Gamer TV. It's here in Bravo. It's a Sky

775
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,720
thing, Rupert Murdoch thing anyway. I want to say we get that over here. Don't,

776
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,200
didn't they used to show that on a G4 at some point?

777
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,400
gamer TV yeah I'm a different network though but

778
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
yeah okay with one of the show anyway I'm sorry go ahead yeah

779
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,280
what basically it's been backing up what you say about games and

780
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,480
parents and the rest but this one in particular was about a doctor in

781
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,320
Chicago saying games are very good and how they influence the

782
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,240
mind and how the keyhole surgery it was I forgot

783
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,520
what he said it was it's a on there but it was really

784
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,480
interesting to the point of you saying like how games were influencing

785
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,700
I just thought I would bring that up and the second point was when the hell are they going

786
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,940
to release Outrun for the backwards compatibility?

787
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,820
That was one reason why I kept my game.

788
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:08,020
You know, it's why I hate that guy.

789
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,700
First off, to address the first point about the Chicago guy, I want to say this sounds

790
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,580
very similar to a story we had a while back.

791
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,700
It was a little while ago and I don't know if it's the same one or different or what,

792
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,060
but it seems like once in a while you do get these doctors who come out and say, you know

793
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:32,620
know what, this really does help reaction times, hand eye coordination is the old fall

794
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,620
back.

795
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,020
I actually read a test in a psychological journal that was talking about reaction times

796
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:42,180
especially when playing puzzle games, RPGs, versus non-gamers and that the gamer group

797
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,140
came out way ahead.

798
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,460
It's too bad our politicians don't seem to be counting any of that.

799
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:54,980
There is nothing over here in the same politics way going towards gaming.

800
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,500
How is it over there?

801
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:01,380
While I've got a UK listener on the phone, I can kind of ask what is the impression over

802
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,580
there of what is going on over here with the gaming laws?

803
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,980
Is it we're a bunch of crazies over here in America or is it the same things happening

804
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,980
over here?

805
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,980
There is nothing going on.

806
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:12,980
I've not seen it in the papers.

807
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,980
It's just from you guys.

808
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,980
I get all my gaming news.

809
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,260
So when I'm in the store, you know you talk about a game, the store, a friend of the manager

810
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:25,340
there and literally you see little kids coming up saying, can I buy this and he's blunt with

811
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:30,340
them and says, do I look stupid, put it back, go away and he's so blunt with them and it

812
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,340
just makes me laugh.

813
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,340
That's great.

814
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,580
That sounds like how my husband does.

815
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:40,260
You don't get that level of rudeness here in America except in some certain cities.

816
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,420
New York used to have that stigma but I don't know, in the recent years they're not so much

817
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,420
the rude place anymore, and when I went there I had a great experience.

818
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:51,420
I've been in a GameStop with Dan fully telling them to get out of the store and get their

819
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,420
parents.

820
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,420
Dan's rude, but in a funny way.

821
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,420
That's why I married him.

822
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,860
I was muffing to him and saying, that's not good customer service, but you work in a bank.

823
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,780
There's rude, rude, and then there's rude funny, and Dan's rude funny.

824
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,780
Yeah.

825
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,780
All right.

826
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,900
Somehow or another he gets away with it.

827
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,660
I work for a bank myself, and there's a big difference in the level of customer, though.

828
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,740
yeah well over here we've got like it's just local bank I mean it's national

829
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:21,420
it's owned by RBS World Bank Scotland but not giving them advertising because

830
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,720
I no longer work for them. I want to say real quick too on your second point about

831
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:33,200
Outrun you know I I'm sure everybody has that one game they wish the damn 360

832
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,520
would emulate already and the sad thing is we're gonna be waiting a long long

833
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,480
time before they're all available. Usually when they get one they get about

834
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,200
like 20, because you know they weren't targeting that Barbie adventure game.

835
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,020
And I don't know how many times I've said this to people when they bitch about, why

836
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:53,600
is Barbie emulatable and Outrun isn't?

837
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Well because...

838
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,600
Not that I'm saying this.

839
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
What did you say?

840
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Because Mattel paid for it?

841
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,840
Well no, because Barbie is probably very similar in its design to, I don't know, Halo or one

842
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,440
of the games that is already playable.

843
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,240
I'm not trying to say Barbies like Halo.

844
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,000
Go back to 8-bit and 16-bit emulation.

845
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,040
It's almost the same way.

846
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,240
For instance, the NES games.

847
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,160
A lot of NES games are assigned to certain mappers.

848
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,840
I don't want to get into too much detail, but all the NES games are on certain mappers.

849
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,080
For a lot of these obscure Japanese titles, the reason why those were the last ones to

850
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:32,120
be emulated on NES emulators is because their mappers were not one of the standard.

851
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,800
I think there are five or six standard ones.

852
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,200
The crazy ones are outside of that.

853
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,800
You would have to basically write new code for each mapper.

854
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,640
Take that idea and apply it to Xbox and Xbox 360, that's kind of what's going on.

855
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,580
Is that, you know, when you unlock one big game, you might unlock a bunch of little crappy

856
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,360
ones that were similar in design.

857
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,960
But it's not that Xbox is targeting those crap games, it's that it just happens that

858
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,840
they work so it can just boost their numbers, yippee.

859
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,120
It brings, it raises the whole situation you said about PlayStation 3, they put simply

860
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,160
just a Playstation in there but again with the Xbox because it was such a PC they've

861
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,200
really hit a brick wall with it so.

862
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,360
Well it was Microsoft's decision to go with the different graphics setup so you know it's

863
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,180
it's uh they had to weigh that pro and con when they did it so they got to be responsible

864
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,180
for that decision.

865
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,000
Brilliant, alright well listen you set up that PayPal donation fund and I'll definitely

866
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,320
do it for you guys coming over here.

867
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,760
I appreciate it you're a you're a true trooper we appreciate you listening okay.

868
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,760
Take care of yourselves.

869
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,760
Thanks for calling in.

870
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,760
Thanks for calling.

871
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,760
Alright.

872
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,760
Sleep well.

873
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,060
Whenever he finally goes to sleep there.

874
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,860
I wanted to point out here in the chatroom,

875
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,560
Black Wolf, our buddy Bobby, over on...

876
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,060
They're on Captain N again.

877
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,560
Huh?

878
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
They're on Captain N again.

879
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,460
No, no, no, not Bobby.

880
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,060
Bobby's saying...

881
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,960
Well, he might be somewhere else,

882
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,160
but Bobby is saying they did target Big Mother Truckers.

883
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
Why?

884
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,460
Because there's a certain demographic that goes for that,

885
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:54,960
you know, and let's...

886
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,260
And they're all in this...

887
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,160
Yeah, I know, I know.

888
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,660
Let's do one more call here.

889
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,660
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

890
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,260
Who's this?

891
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,160
It's the one and only man.

892
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,300
It's the one and only choppy legend of Zaku who is choppy, choppy in and out, who needs

893
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,380
to turn off the porn torrents.

894
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
What's up?

895
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:16,380
All right, I got word on the street that Supernova is coming out this Wednesday in Dave & Buster's

896
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,660
in Times Square.

897
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,780
And for the three or four listeners we have in Times Square, they're going to be really

898
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,780
happy.

899
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:29,860
It's been confirmed by folks who are on the inside of the company and the people that

900
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,860
work there.

901
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:36,260
Since I'm 21, that's a definite of me actually going there that Wednesday.

902
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,260
Okay.

903
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,300
Hooray for you, but what about the rest of us?

904
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,580
We have listeners in New York.

905
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:47,860
I understand that, but we have lots of listeners, a fraction of which live in New York.

906
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:55,460
What I'm trying to get at, the point is, is this going to be a trend for Dave & Busters

907
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,300
because there are lots of Dave & Busters everywhere?

908
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,300
What I'm hearing is that they're going to phase out their pump it up machines and supernovas.

909
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,260
Ooh, Miglotov's going to be pissed.

910
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,740
That's what I'm hearing right there.

911
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,500
They're trying to use that as a replacement.

912
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,740
Now the DDR's gone legit here.

913
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,740
Interesting.

914
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,180
Well, we'll see what happens.

915
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,580
Have fun with your supernova.

916
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,660
I guess take pictures, send us a review.

917
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,620
If you want any reviews or any info, I should be able to provide it by next Sunday.

918
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,740
Well, I don't want to sound like a jerk.

919
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,900
We did kind of get to play it at E3.

920
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,900
This one will be the final one, though.

921
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
Alright, well let us know if there's anything different.

922
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,900
That's what I want to know. If there's anything different from what we saw at E3, then let us know.

923
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Alright, I'll give you back the skinny.

924
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
Alright, Zach, we gotta go. We got more calls coming in.

925
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,900
Alright.

926
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,900
Have a good one, buddy.

927
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,900
Bye.

928
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,900
Have fun in your Times Square. Actually, I do love Times Square, though.

929
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,900
I love New York City.

930
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,900
If you do live there and listen to this show, you're lucky, because I do love that place.

931
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,900
Let's go to another phone call. Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

932
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,900
Sky, I was joking about Big Mother Truckers.

933
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
Hi Bobby!

934
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
Are you kidding?

935
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,900
You know what, you can't say things in chat like that

936
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,900
without putting a JK or something

937
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,900
I don't know

938
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,900
I put the JK, it was silent

939
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,900
It was on the internet, therefore it must be true

940
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,900
Alright

941
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,900
You got me

942
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,900
And for that

943
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,900
since you got me, I will let you pimp your show

944
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,900
Go for it

945
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,900
Oh, my show?

946
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
My show is the Bobby Black Wolf Show

947
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,700
about how table tennis does actually have a whore in it.

948
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,020
Yesper!

949
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,020
His name is Yesper.

950
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,620
He is a whore.

951
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,780
And anybody who's played table tennis knows Yesper's a big whore.

952
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,900
Yes he is.

953
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,900
So I just want to clear that up.

954
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,900
Alright, no problem.

955
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,900
Also, Bobby.

956
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,900
Yes?

957
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,900
You win a no-prize.

958
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,900
Okay.

959
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,900
What?

960
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,740
I've been back in my X-Men fandoms to get the no-prize.

961
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,460
Just smile and nod at Dark Sakura tonight.

962
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,180
She's had one too many espresso brownies.

963
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,180
I had one!

964
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,180
I had one!

965
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:59,400
one too many and a banana coconut frappuccino which is crack and captain

969
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,400
more call I lied before and I said that Zach would be the last we're doing one

970
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

971
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
Hi, this is Anoush.

972
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,400
Hi Anoush, what's on your mind?

973
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,400
Oh, I did butcher your name earlier, didn't I?

974
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,400
Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.

975
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
What's on your mind Anoush?

976
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
Just a quick question.

977
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:43,400
Do you guys think that Sony is just going to surprise us all right at launch with all these games and things that no one was expecting?

978
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Whoa, it's like the remix, it's echoing there.

979
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Careful buddy, turn down your volume there, that was kind of weird.

980
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,400
I don't think so because Sony isn't very smart.

981
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,400
I disagree.

982
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,400
I think Sony has surprises left in store. I think

983
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,400
they have to. I think Sony

984
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,400
is going to have to do something to make up for E3.

985
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,400
And I don't know what that is, but it will be a surprise when it's said.

986
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,400
I don't see that Sony is going to leave themselves in this hole that they've dug.

987
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Doug.

988
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,460
What they need to do is they need to gag everybody at that company, shut the F up, do not talk

989
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:31,280
about PS3 anymore, stop talking to the gaming press, and then two months before the system

990
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:37,520
comes out we will have the bang up press conference, we'll have a do-over, and do it right this

991
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,520
time.

992
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,520
I hear that echo again, sorry.

993
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,000
Sorry, I'm leaving a mic for my MacBook Pro.

994
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That's alright.

995
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,080
Anoush, any other thoughts on that that you want to share?

996
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:54,000
really okay well thanks for the question but I've I got to hang up cuz the echo

997
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,660
is driving me nuts

998
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,660
I love what Zander K said in the chat

999
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,660
What did Zander K say?

1000
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,660
It kinda sounds like my wife's breast pump

1001
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,660
Gross!

1002
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,660
That's so nasty

1003
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,660
That was freaky

1004
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,660
Sky's voice second mix from Dark Tetsuya

1005
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,660
That sounded scary

1006
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:17,220
like I don't know like I was in poltergeist or something all right any

1007
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:21,220
Any last minute stories here in studio?

1008
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:26,580
Well, I was going to mention since we talked about Table Tennis that Grand Theft Auto IV

1009
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:32,580
is actually going to be using Table Tennis's graphic engine called Rage, Rockstar's advanced

1010
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:37,460
game engine, for Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's going to be pretty sweet.

1011
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,400
Okay, yeah, Table Tennis is a good looking game, let's hope it carries over into Grand

1012
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,540
Theft Auto, I'm sure it will, I have no doubt it will look sexy, I'm sure.

1013
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:53,780
Sakura do you have anything well there is a list out a very special list okay

1014
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,860
this is basically the list of games that have been released since Duke Nukem

1015
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:03,980
Forever was announced oh boy cuz what was Duke Nukem Forever announced like

1016
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:12,140
how many years ago April 25th 1997 basically if you go to duke.a-13.net

1017
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:18,500
it's the list basically what we have is we've got a whole crap load of Final

1018
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:23,180
Fantasy games starting from seven up through recent cell phone games tactics

1019
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:28,700
crystal chronicles all of the games with Final Fantasy characters in it then it

1020
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:33,820
goes into the Grand Theft Auto series the Legend of Zelda series since

1021
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:40,340
Ocarina of Time a bunch of this is over 75 games in Megaman universe 12 games

1022
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,860
featuring Megaman universe character cameos 50 games in the Star Wars

1023
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,800
universe Mario has been 58 different games since it was announced every thief

1024
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:54,280
game every version of counter-strike half-life every Tony Hawk game video

1025
01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:00,800
game systems the Xbox was released and all the systems since then I also list

1026
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:05,680
some fun facts it says in 1997 the fastest consumer internet connection was

1027
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,480
There's a 33.6 kbps modem.

1028
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:15,820
On average, consumer internet connections were 300 times faster today.

1029
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:23,060
When Duke Nukem Forever was announced, the fastest processor was a 233 MHz Pentium.

1030
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:28,800
In April 1997, there was no Google and there was no eBay.

1031
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
Wait a minute.

1032
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
No, there was eBay.

1033
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
There was eBay.

1034
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,440
It just was not even what it was now.

1035
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,040
There was no weblog.

1036
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:42,560
And as far as disasters, it says there's been 125 hurricanes happened since then, 20 death

1037
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,520
toll-producing tornado outbreaks in the United States, and 50 major earthquakes in the world.

1038
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,520
In other words, it's been a long freaking time since I announced Duke Nukem.

1039
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,640
Britney Spears' entire musical career as a pop star took place since the announcement.

1040
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,520
Somebody had a lot of free time on their hands when they did this.

1041
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,520
This is fabulous.

1042
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,520
I love it.

1043
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,320
Yes, this is great.

1044
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:07,640
40 new members have been elected to the Senate, Bill Clinton finished his presidential term

1045
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:13,400
and George Bush came on, 4 nations acquired nuclear weapons technology, 19 wars have begun

1046
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,560
and 5 wars have ended.

1047
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:21,360
Blaze wants to know why this wasn't the side of the week.

1048
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,040
Because I didn't think about it because we wanted to do sexy Roth and we had already

1049
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,160
decided last week.

1050
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,280
I'm logging into eBay right now to see when I actually...

1051
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,180
worth a mention most assuredly and I think whoever sent it to me

1052
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,580
I'm logging in to see when I bought something on eBay

1053
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,780
I bought something on eBay look at this on my feedback prompt response and payment

1054
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,940
a pleasure to do business with

1055
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:45,940
April 26 1997 was when that feedback was left on my account

1056
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:51,620
I'm old school I have a feedback rating of three because the last time I bought

1057
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,480
something from eBay

1058
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,220
you know when the last feedback was left 99 I remember though I bought Super Metro

1059
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,300
Oh, none of you care. Why am I talking about none of you care?

1060
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,700
We have one more phone call because I forgot I promised this person they could be on tonight higher on orange launch radio

1061
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:10,840
Who's this? I didn't know as a promise. Hey, it's dmn. Hi dmn. Yeah, I remember saying something about it. What's on your mind?

1062
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,640
Um, well, I found out how to give away the Wii

1063
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:20,080
Okay, that's right. You're giving away a Wii. Yes. Okay. How you gonna give away a Wii?

1064
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:26,760
Well because I'm a huge fan of interactivity just like you guys are people who come listen live in the chat room and

1065
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,980
argue appropriately with your discussion get points the more points they get the

1066
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:36,540
more stuff they get if they win during the week right now actually a funny

1067
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:41,060
Dale's kicking everyone's ass they get a t-shirt from Nintendo so funny Dale's

1068
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:47,340
not just a clever name no all right um the highest average score you got to do

1069
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:54,220
at least six of these you get a we Wow so so in other words you have this

1070
01:05:54,220 --> 01:06:00,320
completely subjective system that you just are going to pretty much give the system to

1071
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,580
whoever you think is the funniest?

1072
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:06,020
Not necessarily the funniest, whoever brings the better arguments.

1073
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,020
Whoever is the wittiest?

1074
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,020
Yes.

1075
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,020
Oh, get it?

1076
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,020
The wittiest!

1077
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,020
Yeah.

1078
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,020
Do I get points for that?

1079
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,020
Yeah, the joke's like that.

1080
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,020
I get points for that?

1081
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,020
Ah, damn it.

1082
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,420
Well, everybody, good luck.

1083
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:21,980
I hope it brings a lot more people in the chat room.

1084
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,260
What do the hosts get out of this?

1085
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,760
Because I noticed you've been rating the hosts, too.

1086
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,720
You guys just get points for the hell of it.

1087
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,700
You guys just need to ask me and I'll get you stuff.

1088
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,700
You know how that works.

1089
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,700
I want a Wii.

1090
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,700
I want a Wii.

1091
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,700
I want a Wii.

1092
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:39,300
No, if you send us the communal Wii, we'll fight to the death over it.

1093
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,420
That'll be Orange Lounge Battle Royale.

1094
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,780
We'll tape it and put it on YouTube.

1095
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,780
It'll be on my MySpace profile.

1096
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:53,100
Speaking of Nintendo stuff, they've got some new videos of Super Paper Mario on YouTube.

1097
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,100
Sexy!

1098
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,140
From the World Hobby Fair, and they look awesome.

1099
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,400
Show me, show me, show me!

1100
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,400
I know it's radio, I don't care, show me.

1101
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,180
I haven't seen the game come through where I am yet, so, um.

1102
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,060
Have you seen the Wii yet?

1103
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,060
Nope.

1104
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,620
Oh, damn.

1105
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,980
October dates looking bleaker and bleaker.

1106
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,940
From what I've heard, and don't quote me on this, it'll probably start in August.

1107
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:17,020
okay well what does that mean if it tests in August? Does that mean we might still

1108
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,780
see October?

1109
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,780
I don't know

1110
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,300
I don't know how long the DS was in testing

1111
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,580
uh...

1112
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:29,660
and even if I don't think I'd be at liberty to say. Okay I don't want you to

1113
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,820
lose your job I guess I better have you be quiet

1114
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:37,780
uh... but other than that yeah that's pretty much all I got

1115
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:41,140
yeah I'm gonna let you guys go and finish up your show. Alright

1116
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,900
Well, thank you for the contest and encouraging folks to interact with us live on Sunday nights

1117
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:52,260
at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on Orangelaunchradio.com because you might win DMN's Wii.

1118
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,260
Whoa.

1119
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,380
Well, you said it.

1120
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,580
That is what they are going to win your Wii, right?

1121
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:58,580
Sure.

1122
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,580
All right.

1123
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,580
Have a good one, buddy.

1124
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,580
Take care, man.

1125
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,580
Later.

1126
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,580
Thanks.

1127
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,580
Bye.

1128
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,580
He rocks.

1129
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:09,300
Not only does he give us insider scoop, but he gives stuff away just because he loves

1130
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,060
you guys.

1131
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,960
We love you guys, too, but we gotta go.

1132
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,320
We're done for tonight.

1133
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,440
No more show for us.

1134
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,320
I need ice cream.

1135
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,280
So thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight.

1136
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,480
We really appreciate it.

1137
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,760
And thank you for supporting internet radio.

1138
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,560
Thank you for supporting independent internet radio.

1139
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,440
And thanks to you guys for listening to us every week.

1140
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,560
We appreciate it, and we'll see you back here next week.

1141
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,760
Next week is a big show.

1142
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,600
It's a big show.

1143
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,880
Do you know why next week is a big show?

1144
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,080
Because...

1145
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,740
Because we said so.

1146
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,500
because it's our birthday.

1147
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,700
Yeah, we're gonna be this many.

1148
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,300
We're gonna be four years old

1149
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:49,340
and I'm hoping somebody brings cake next week.

1150
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,620
A chocolate cake.

1151
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,860
We need a cake in the shape of a cock.

1152
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,740
Okay.

1153
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:58,120
Okay, well we'll go let Jamie take out

1154
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,220
whatever aggression she needs to do right now.

1155
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:04,540
I want a cake in the shape of a mumbler.

1156
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,180
Fuck that, I just want an ice cream cake.

1157
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:07,220
Is that too much to ask?

1158
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,240
Let's just go get ice cream.

1159
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,720
All right, that's it.

1160
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,520
We'll see you back here next week

1161
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,380
for our fourth anniversary show.

1162
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,520
Hopefully some guests coming out of the woodwork here.

1163
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,960
Again, we're kinda trying to save all the fireworks

1164
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,360
for episode 200, which is coming up,

1165
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,200
because that's the bigger deal to me, I don't know.

1166
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,200
And because Fourth of July will have come around

1167
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,560
and we can purchase fireworks.

1168
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,620
That's true, that's a good point.

1169
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,880
So we'll see you back here.

1170
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,900
Regardless, we'll have something special,

1171
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,140
I'm sure, next week for our fourth birthday.

1172
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,360
So tune in then, and thank you guys once again

1173
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,320
for supporting us, we really appreciate it.

1174
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:44,400
Alright, one more thing we gotta do before we gotta go though, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought.

1175
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,860
Loki, your final thought.

1176
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:51,520
Super Paper Mario looks awesome, in fact you can switch dimensions in the game, that's pretty sweet.

1177
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,480
My final thought is, I have new t-shirts coming next week and I'm very excited

1178
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,640
from the internet, because the internet sells funny t-shirts.

1179
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,860
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

1180
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,200
Loco Roco!

1181
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,200
And reject false icons. See you next time.

1182
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:20,560
Thank you.
