14319	20804	Tonight, June 4th, 2006, DS Lights hit the street a bit early, could gaming be shown at the next Olympics?
21224	25688	And more add-ons are announced for RPGs like Final Fantasy XI and Oblivion.
33919	36960	Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
37040	42061	This is episode number 185 for this June the 4th of 2006.
42101	48763	We're here to talk about video games and gaming and the gaming culture and all the gaming news you guys really want to know about.
49243	50223	And I'm here to help you do that.
50283	51244	My name is Rob Roberts.
51264	53524	You might know me as Sky and she's here to help you too.
53624	56105	Her name is DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
57279	58679	I help those who help themselves.
78806	84209	In the past, through emails and stuff, you've kind of been getting a lot of sickness in the past six months on the show.
85450	94375	To not go into it in too much detail, all of the random illnesses that I've had have all stemmed from one thing, which is chronic fatigue syndrome.
96136	100098	For those who think that taking an app will help you get over it, screw you, because it doesn't.
101899	104080	It's a cumulative issue.
104280	108003	It's something that just takes nutrition, time.
108463	109264	Eventually it goes away.
109304	110604	Some people have it their whole lives.
110644	112326	Some people are bedridden for years with it.
113266	114307	I'm just really tired.
115267	118810	I was actually reading in Wikipedia about this because you were talking to me about this on AOL.
118830	123152	You actually linked me to something in Wikipedia on it and it turns out you have something in common with Cher.
124293	124894	Oh, joy.
124914	124994	Yeah.
126346	128688	if I could turn back time.
128928	132451	You don't have an affinity towards hay or anything like that.
132492	136855	Oh, that must be the one and only Loki because here come the jokes from Techmaster Loki.
137696	138757	God, Cher is like...
139735	140215	You know what?
140456	142257	Everyone wondered what happened to Mr. Ed.
142657	143959	Cher is what happened to Mr. Ed.
144339	145760	They're the same person!
146120	146981	Same person!
147001	148382	My mother loves Cher.
148722	150724	I actually went to a Cher concert.
150764	153647	I know you want to make all those jokes about, you know, because I'm gay I must love Cher.
153927	156829	She's okay, but my mom loves her.
157009	157730	Oh my gosh.
157870	158270	Loves her.
158711	162074	But she's made out of porcelain and ceramic and acrylic.
162094	162474	Alright.
163447	165869	Now wait, we're not share talk, so back to games for a minute.
165889	169011	In FanimeCon last week, somebody actually brought you chocolate, right?
169231	173314	Yes, one of our listeners brought me chocolate and I'm very, very, very grateful.
173974	177837	And it got all over the bottom of my purse, so I had to wash my purse.
178617	181399	Only a couple pieces got out, all the rest of it were in my tummy.
182920	184921	I did share a couple pieces because I'm nice.
185522	186462	There's no way I could eat all that chocolate.
186482	187223	You didn't share it with me.
188490	189771	I would have if you'd hung around.
212529	237312	I went nuts in the dealer's room Sunday I bought Dan a Famicom controller looking pencil box And I bought him an Ice Climbers cell phone strap It's all digitized I bought myself a slime plushie A lot of Kingdom Hearts, a lot of Final Fantasy, a lot of Squeenix love
238095	239316	and I bought a doll.
239496	242118	Red Octane had a booth that's about the size of this desk.
243198	243999	Of a computer desk.
244019	244699	A normal computer desk.
244940	246961	Yeah, Red Octane wasn't really showing much, were they?
247781	252605	They had Guitar Hero and they were selling controllers and that's it.
252625	253865	But in the groove, absent.
254386	254966	Which is kind of weird.
257508	262431	They were selling the DDR pads but that's about it.
262691	263652	They were just selling stuff.
263672	264292	They were a vendor.
264512	266574	They weren't trying to show off new games or anything.
266594	266874	It's just
267912	269892	Here's Our Crap By It, you know, that type of thing.
269912	283815	I'll tell you who was impressive, though, was Yes Japan, that's doing, they have, like, Japanese lessons, but they also are a label that are bringing out a lot of Japanese artists in the United States, and one of them is Guitar Vader, who did a lot of music in Jet Set Radio.
284275	284816	Oh, cool.
284836	295998	Guitar Vader wasn't there this year, although their guitarist made it out, or one of their people made it out and was doing some stuff with a couple of the other bands there, but I didn't get to see it.
296038	296278	I was...
297305	314454	I think it was near our panel or something around our panel, so I didn't actually get to see this, but I did get to talk with them, and who knows, you guys might hear something, some Guitar Vader on our station soon.
314814	315735	Cool, very cool.
316955	326000	I just want to say real quick, as far as live appearances go, we are confirmed for Fonamay 2007, and next year maybe we're looking to broadcast from the center stage, which should be pretty awesome.
327721	331202	Our friend there is working on getting us broadcasting ability.
331402	331802	Very cool.
332202	334063	And just other live appearances coming up.
334103	339865	I know in July, and not even these guys know about this yet, but there's the Sacramento thing is confirmed for July.
340346	341106	How I knew about that.
343245	344326	I ordered a doll.
344986	349208	I'm getting into the 60 centimeter Volks of Bitsu dolls.
349228	353449	I ordered from Junkie Spot and he called me today to make sure that my address was right.
353910	357071	And just gave me all kinds of pointers and tips and said, and we're going to be at this convention.
357551	358692	I was like, oh, I might be there.
359632	360092	That's funny.
360332	362633	So I find that ironic.
362653	364194	No, we're going to do that in Sacramento in July.
364314	367235	And then they're trying to get us to Seattle tomorrow.
367580	374042	Next year, if we can afford it, I know at least I'll go, and I think Jamie was talking about going, so maybe if we can get Loki, we'll all go to the SakuraCon next year.
375183	375883	It's meCon.
376043	378644	I'm hoping to do one East CoastCon next year.
378684	380165	I don't know what or when yet.
380565	383366	That'll really be up to Ranma, who's my East Coast buddy.
384292	384732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
409381	410242	Foname07 on the Foname boards
432149	433731	I played some Ragnarok and I made Assassin finally.
433811	434411	I hit job level 50.
455748	463393	and now I'm like assassin job level 24 and that happened in like a day and that's basically been it.
463513	471118	There has been UNO going on in my house and we were going to buy a Whirlwind pinball machine but that fell through.
471599	479184	We got back our Judge Dredd machine and as it's working out we've got a line in on a jackpot.
480626	492813	A pin bot right now, but Dan's wanting to find a jack bot, which has the same play field as pin bot and has the same music as pin bot and the special music.
492853	499896	It's like a combination of pin bot and bride of pin bot with a souped up display and board and everything.
500177	502438	Okay, if you get that, I'm going to be at your house every day.
503398	508361	I told Dan that, and he was like, well, half the reason we get the pins is for friends to play.
509261	510843	So let's come over and play our other pins, too.
510863	514307	I was going to say, what is with the sudden interest in pinball games?
514327	514687	Sudden?
514707	515308	My butt.
515328	515928	Dan's been.
516008	519472	Yeah, but you guys haven't really bought machines before.
519592	521634	Well, we had an apartment before.
521915	522435	All right, all right.
522595	525459	We have a garage now, which we intend on filling with machines.
525559	530985	But Dan's been downloading the pinball emulators, like PinMame and some of those.
531585	539475	for like ages and one of the machines that we're really really looking for although it's really expensive we want to get a good deal on one is a Black Knight 2000
540646	543008	I think I've asked this on a previous show like a long time ago.
543028	543649	Theater of Magic.
543729	544950	Before we were podcasting.
545030	546712	Is Pin Mame based out of Sacramento?
546812	547493	The people who do that?
548253	548714	Nearby.
548794	552477	Because I've seen a car around town that has like a Pin Mame license plate.
552497	553859	And I'm like, dude, is that the guy?
553879	554699	No, dude, it's Carmichael.
555220	555480	Really?
555560	557622	I think he's out of Carmichael because Dan's been by there.
557682	558803	We need to get that guy on the show.
559364	560445	That's just a stone's throw away.
560665	561646	We'll have to get a hold of him.
561806	564308	Loki practically... No, you're in Orangevale, not Carmichael.
565287	565768	Goldfish
573066	573566	You bet!
573926	574687	I no longer like you.
574707	575927	They're actually Pretzel Goldfish.
575967	576648	Anyway, your games.
576988	578068	Games, oh yeah.
578108	579249	I've been playing Goldfish the game.
579309	580630	No.
580770	584711	I actually have been doing not a whole much of gaming.
585692	588693	I've been intending on sitting down with Kingdom Hearts, but I've been like, meh.
589614	589934	Meh.
590974	594676	And it's just been pinball, pinball, pinball, pinball.
594716	596157	And I play Dig Dug.
597698	600539	On one of those little joystick-looking video game machines.
601047	602509	Oh, Machine and a Joystick.
602529	603751	Yeah, the Machine and a Joystick thing.
604191	607816	They had a Pac-Man score tournament, and then I was like, screw y'all, I'm playing Dig Dug.
608837	611160	And so I got further in Dig Dug than anybody in the house could.
611761	611981	Sweet.
612442	612562	Yep.
613392	614073	DigDugMan
633143	636044	Oh, I don't like the kid size one, but they had an adult size one too that was awesome.
636284	637825	They had the kid one at Stockton Golf Land.
637845	651489	The Lord of the Rings pinball is the win, but it was... The Lord of the Rings pinball and Star Wars pinball were the pinball... I think it was called Pinball 2000 series, which actually did not appeal to a lot of pinball players because it was more of an old school pinball thing.
651549	655911	So I think those are the only two Pinball 2000 machines there are and we're not seeing any more.
656231	657952	I think Williams stopped making pinball machines.
658852	661133	One of the last pinball machines that I would love to play is...
662691	663151	Big Bang Bar
684235	686256	We need, yeah, we do need Orange Lounge Pinball.
686756	689076	DJ Poo Eater says, OLR Pinball would be fun.
689096	690457	You get to bang around Loki's balls.
691277	692557	I don't know how Loki would feel about that.
692857	697299	But I do like DJ Poo Eater's other comment about, I like the Elvira Pinball, because Elvira's the shit.
697599	702560	I didn't, you know, actually one of the old school ones that they had there that they were repairing was an Electra Pinball.
702960	707101	That one that had the three levels, the inside level, the medium, and the outside level.
707161	710362	It's actually pretty, from what I understand, pretty hard to get one of those.
710502	713583	But we actually traded them our Fathom Pinball for Johnny Mnemonic.
714262	716623	DMN has a great idea, Snakes on a Plane Pinball.
717123	717543	As if.
717563	722624	What's sad though is that I think that pinballs are like a dying breed.
724044	727805	What do you think about pinball games on a video?
728105	735027	Well, they've actually, this is a good thing, the people who do Ultracade are doing Ultra Pin.
735871	736292	DarkSakura.com
750077	752518	Is it really a replacement for an actual table, though?
752538	753559	I don't know.
753639	765264	The whole thing about this is that it's actually going to emulate something like 30 to 60, I think, something classic tables, including Black Knight, Pinbot, Bride of Pinbot.
766440	770965	I have to find some more information on it, but they've actually, I think, they're supposed to have some in test locations.
771265	777512	I guess that's cool, but I just don't like that idea as much as actually watching the metal ball go up the ramp and around.
777812	778733	I'd have to see it.
779013	786321	But I'd say, though, that for the sake of, you know, since these tables are getting harder and harder to find, I think that it's a good idea.
787162	789104	It's a good idea to bring it out there for people who
789625	791326	who missed the old school pinball action.
791546	791746	Right.
792226	795587	All right, well, before we turn into the pinball show, we better get back on some video games.
795607	796588	Hey, pinball's a video game.
796668	797648	There's nothing wrong with pinball.
797708	801449	There's a video screen in the background with the dot matrix, but hey.
801549	802550	Loki, how was your gaming week?
803510	804010	It was okay.
804391	811273	I try to play more games, but unfortunately the wife has been hogging the 360 to play Bejeweled.
811613	814374	This is so weird to hear because the wife hates video games.
814714	815014	Yeah.
815655	817535	Yeah, so what did I do yesterday?
818016	818676	Yeah, I was playing...
820126	821206	more new Super Mario Bros.
821286	848131	and I'm already getting tired of the game I'm already on level 4 I've actually completely finished 1 through 3 gotten all the secret stuff and all that but I'm just kind of getting bored with it already and I don't know it's just not as good as some of the other games I guess um then I've been playing trying to get through Ghost Recon I'm almost done with that finally and then um
849892	852113	I don't know, I've been trying a few other games.
852153	855115	I tried that, uh... What was it?
855496	856196	Jewel Quest.
856676	857337	That was okay.
858577	858878	I don't know.
859078	863080	I've already bought, like, almost every single live game or arcade game on there.
863361	866262	Except for, like, the crappy card games, because who wants crappy card games?
866302	866943	I mean, seriously.
867543	869064	Even if you had, like, Uno.
871666	872426	Uno's fun!
872546	873587	I like Uno.
873867	877730	Uno's fun, but, like, you know, Hard With Hearts, Hard With Backgammon, I mean, no.
877850	878030	No.
879190	879870	Lame.
880991	882731	I don't know.
882811	885452	I haven't really gotten anything new.
885972	887993	No new games coming out that I really want.
888173	889273	Hitman maybe.
890554	891494	I really don't know though.
891514	896475	I'm thinking just waiting until July, August when some better games come out.
898376	907599	I have been to get Jaws on my PlayStation 2 hard drive so I can bust that game out because
908032	912714	I heard the game is so damn glitchy and stuff, but it's worth trying because you can play it as a shark.
912894	917417	You know what though, with a concept like that, it might be cool to have a game as glitchy as Driver 3.
918217	918497	It is.
918817	922039	It is as glitchy as Driver 3, so that's kind of cool.
922779	926961	Because Driver 3, that was what made it fun, is the fact that it was so crappy.
927081	934465	It had the perfect balance of really shitty AI and gameplay elements,
935564	938386	with, you know, just, you know, an okay game.
938586	946032	So, it wasn't so bad to where as you don't want to play it, but it wasn't, you know, so good as where as you need to pick it up.
946112	950775	It's just equally awful, you know, across all levels.
950895	955178	So, that game's really fun, especially if you can get it cheap because it's so glitchy.
955218	959742	You can literally play it for like an afternoon and just... So, it's like one of those... It's like a B-movie.
959842	960162	It is.
960222	961363	It's like a bad B-movie.
961423	962844	It's so bad it's good.
963124	963424	Exactly.
963444	963905	Like Jaws 3D.
965293	971214	and Jaws on the consoles which just came out.
971794	972635	It's a cheap ass game.
972655	981456	It's like $29.99 but just wait a couple of weeks once people buy it and say hey this game sucks and then they sell it back get those copies for even cheaper.
981956	982977	So that's what you need to do.
984477	984837	Anything else?
987438	989698	Just Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories again.
989938	990438	The usual.
990618	993819	We're going back to the team games we've been doing free-for-alls and
994476	997722	It's still fun because we just find new ways to kill each other.
999645	1002070	It's still a highlight of the day.
1004781	1005282	All right.
1005342	1008443	I should mention in our chat room right now over at OrangeLawnRadio.com, click on chat.
1008463	1014445	If you are listening live here on Sunday night on our station, it looks like DMN is in chat right now.
1014485	1020106	And he, for whatever reason, has an extra Zelda GameCube collector's disc burning a hole in his pocket.
1020206	1022527	You know, the one that had all like the classic Zelda games on it.
1023047	1025248	And he's just giving it away to a random chatter right now.
1025268	1027349	He's asking trivia questions and making a game out of it.
1027409	1027929	And, you know,
1028291	1029331	He said, you guys cool with that?
1029391	1030392	I'm like, yeah.
1030512	1034994	I got ripped out of the one that actually had the Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on there as well.
1035054	1038375	I only got the one with both of the Nintendo 64 ones.
1038915	1039775	I might have an extra.
1040816	1042256	You could enter DMN's contest right now.
1042356	1042756	I don't care.
1043617	1044797	I never played that one anyway.
1047038	1049459	We need to get one of those multiplayer Pac-Man games.
1049519	1052060	That was the one on the GameCube, remember?
1052740	1053521	Oh, Pac-Man Versus.
1054281	1054641	Yeah.
1055458	1056198	I never did play that.
1056418	1056938	It looked fun, though.
1057418	1061139	All right, I want to go over to my gaming week, because I actually have quite a bit that I was playing this week.
1061799	1064420	In my personal life, I got jury duty this week.
1064960	1067721	And most people were telling me that jury duty, you know, bring a book.
1068061	1068901	It's going to be boring.
1069121	1071181	You're going to sit there all day long, and nothing's going to happen.
1071481	1075182	So I took my DS, and yeah, there was a lot of dead time there.
1075582	1078223	But the rest of it didn't go how they said it would.
1078243	1080243	They said I would get dismissed by the end of the day.
1080603	1083224	I actually got put on a jury for a trial that's going to last two weeks.
1083644	1083824	So...
1085393	1093636	I guess I'll be playing a lot of DS while I'm at the courthouse because there's a lot of down... I mean, we get like hour and a half lunches and all this crazy stuff, so I have a DS to keep me busy.
1093676	1102359	I've been playing Final Fantasy 1, which I realize is not a DS game, but Extifer keeps forgetting to loan me the new Super Mario Bros.
1102379	1103879	cartridge that I keep wanting to play.
1104860	1109521	And the only other game I had ready available when I left for the courthouse was Super Princess Peach.
1110021	1111462	And that game kind of... I don't know.
1112722	1114723	An action game isn't as easy to play...
1115583	1115903	and so on.
1134356	1140458	Final Fantasy 1, if you haven't played it before, the one on the Game Boy Advance, they really souped it up from the NES.
1140799	1152923	It's not as frustrating because they switched the battle system to more like Final Fantasy 4, where if your whole party attacks one monster and it dies, it doesn't end up being wasted attacks, it will attack a different monster.
1153343	1156484	I know that was one really frustrating thing about Final Fantasy 1 on the NES.
1156909	1160530	but you know that kinda adds to the strategy element I suppose but that is different.
1161310	1179976	I also got a chance to play something new 2DX Red Beatmania 2DX Red or 11 and this is the import game it's not here in America you do have to import it from Japan and of course if you know Beatmania in the US then I'm sure you have heard of the
1180556	1186882	Japanese series that spawned it, and now it's up to its 11th home version game, 13th arcade game.
1187863	1195589	The things I like about 2DX Red, the interface is great, it's slick, it's got an awesome interface, it's a customizable interface.
1196089	1204797	One of the things you unlock, you don't really unlock songs in 2DX anymore, you unlock either gallery art or you unlock customization pieces.
1205157	1217487	So you can actually change the picture that's on the turntable, the bar that is falling down during the parts of the song, what the notes look like when they explode when you hit the buttons, or you can change the whole damn skin around it.
1217787	1220709	Now there's only like seven or so preset ones.
1223351	1228252	So you don't have total freedom, but it's still pretty cool because you can mix and match and kind of make the game your own a little bit.
1228292	1233054	So I thought that was kind of a neat addition and something fun to unlock there.
1233194	1239556	My only real problem with Beatmania 2DX Red is that I'm not a fan of the songs as much as previous styles.
1239836	1246357	There's some really good songs, but overall I think I prefer 9th, 7th, kind of going back to some of the older styles.
1246758	1251759	But they did bring back some good older songs, except V isn't one of them.
1252339	1257305	V is the song that has been in like every Beatmania 2DX game in Japan since 5th style, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th.
1257605	1258587	It is not in 11th.
1259147	1260729	They finally gave it a rest for a little while.
1260989	1268999	Yeah, until they come up with the next, you know, was it 2DX 14 or whatever and it's gonna be V2 or something like that or VV or something.
1269059	1270520	It'll be H, it'll be Handel.
1271189	1271549	We'll see.
1273410	1277291	The other part that I love about 2DX Red is rival data.
1277631	1284233	Because Miklatov is the one that brought it to the house here, so I had a chance to play it, and I started playing on my memory card.
1284473	1289534	Well, I was able to put in his memory card and load his scores onto my card.
1290034	1297436	So what that would do is it would show me, hey, these are the songs you're doing better than Miklatov at, and these are the songs you need to improve on if you want to be better than Miklatov.
1297736	1299597	And you can, I think, load up to five people.
1300237	1303800	And the other cool thing is you can do rival data against yourself, essentially.
1304160	1318510	If you go into the options and you go all the way down to the bottom and you see this little turntable, you can change it so that if you're playing one player, you know how usually in Beatmania the right side of the screen, if you're playing left or vice versa, if you're a player two side person, the left side is just blank.
1318850	1319711	Nothing happens there.
1320031	1327937	Well, what will happen instead is that that will be replaced by a bar graph that goes up showing you how your combo compares to the last game that you played.
1328277	1330360	I'm sorry, not your combo, but your Beatmania points.
1330380	1332964	You get plus two for a flashing great, plus one for a great.
1333284	1334166	It kind of shows that in bar graph.
1334206	1335548	Very similar to Keyboard Mania.
1335768	1338472	If you've ever played Keyboard Mania, it's almost like they stole it from Keyboard Mania.
1339033	1339754	So, huh?
1341717	1341957	Okay.
1342638	1342898	All right.
1344785	1350907	and yeah, so rival data is pretty cool and it kind of gives you incentive to keep playing because I have to be better than Miklatov, so that's 2DX Red.
1351427	1355909	I definitely recommend it to music games fans that have a Japanese PlayStation 2.
1355949	1368793	Those of you guys that don't have a Japanese PlayStation 2, let's hope that Konami of America releases a Beatmania 2 here in the US and that they'll use this game's interface to model it off of because I think that would happen and that would be pretty sweet.
1371181	1371842	R2-Beat Beat Mania
1391311	1395832	You need to play R2-B because R2-B is a real creative idea for a music game.
1396253	1402515	I really like it because it gets into the kind of competitive nature a little more, like some of the songs are very competitive.
1404335	1410317	So if you want to check this out, there's actually one of our listeners has a website that's all about this game.
1410677	1417299	And you're going to have to kind of follow the directions on the forums of this website to be able to play the game because it's all in Japanese.
1417459	1419920	So unless you read and understand Japanese fluently,
1420120	1420740	DJ MaxxUS.bamanistyle.com
1440191	1468606	It kind of makes me think of like a Mario Kart rhythm game because in one of the modes you can use items on other players and it's pretty creative some of the items they come up with like one of them will send out this giant King Kong type thing onto the racetrack that'll beat the racetrack so that your screen shakes so it's really hard to see the notes as they're coming down another item will like throw headphones onto your opponent's head that will change the song completely that they're hearing so that the beats won't match up or anything makes it very difficult for a couple measures
1468906	1469627	So it's kind of fun.
1469687	1473710	So that's kind of where I get the Mario Kart thing, because the items really add a whole different flair to it.
1475192	1477133	So the pros about this game, it's free.
1478314	1479855	Graphically, it's pretty kick-butt.
1480376	1484700	I was given a tip, you can actually use Alt-Enter to play the game in a window if you don't like it taking up your whole screen.
1485180	1487282	And it's a real kind of clever music game.
1487542	1489604	The only cons that I really saw is that...
1490464	1494786	It's got a really steep learning curve because of the fact that the game's not in English.
1495206	1499288	So you really have to be patient if you want to learn this game.
1499548	1504210	You will get frustrated with it very easy if the language barrier is going to be a problem for you.
1504910	1507631	But I force myself to kind of get through the tutorial and everything.
1507651	1508631	And it's not so bad.
1508671	1509452	You can figure it out.
1509552	1510172	Use common sense.
1510192	1511192	You'll figure out how to play the game.
1512933	1513793	So I like it.
1514113	1515854	I think you guys should check it out if you get a chance.
1515894	1517734	If you like music games, because it's free.
1518234	1528597	I don't know if this is the type of game I would pay money for, just because it seems like the type of game I'll only play for a little while, even though it does offer some kind of customization, like you can change your hair, change your clothes.
1529977	1532978	I don't really see myself playing this the long term, but I don't know.
1533078	1535439	They do have the fact that they can expand...
1535799	1536320	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1546725	1550007	It's part of a network of a bunch of other different kinds of games.
1550387	1553729	And I think in that way, it'll be great.
1553809	1556830	It's actually part of a network called GameChew.jp.
1556890	1559271	That's their website, GameChew.jp.
1559872	1566055	And I think I would really enjoy this game as a part of a selection of games from a website.
1566135	1571037	So check it out if you guys want to see a crazy-looking game.
1571678	1572298	Other than that...
1572864	1575865	Just a buffet of Xbox Live arcade games and some Rockstar table tennis.
1576165	1577065	That's all for me.
1578165	1581666	Alright, let's get into some gaming news here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1581686	1584767	We're going to start off tonight with Loki, I think.
1585347	1595189	Yes, and basically the story to start things off is about the DS Lite and how some stores just don't get street dates.
1595950	1601191	One of the store chains being Target, the other one being Walmart, and basically...
1602412	1606813	You know, the shipments of these new systems have already come in to pretty much everybody.
1606913	1610234	In fact, I mean, my company that I work at, they actually have them right now.
1610694	1622976	Of course, you know, like most things, you're not supposed to sell until street date, you know, to basically either make it, you know, fair for everybody, you know, so that one person doesn't have it sooner than the other and that type of thing.
1623496	1626797	But, you know, companies don't realize this or either just ignore it.
1627357	1631598	And so, you know, in the case of like certain Targets and Walmarts,
1631991	1633853	Just went ahead and sold it the day they got them.
1634033	1638036	So people have already been picking them up, put them on eBay and whatnot.
1640058	1643441	So basically if you're lucky enough to find one, more power to you.
1644158	1647499	Which is ridiculous since you can just order them online from Japan.
1647679	1648819	Exactly, and it doesn't matter anyways.
1648839	1649599	For almost the same price.
1649640	1651040	I mean, they're really coming out in about a week.
1651380	1652200	Yeah, just wait.
1652520	1654641	And by the way, this is not the first time Target's broken street date.
1654721	1655321	Oh, no, no.
1655381	1656641	I'm surprised Toys R Us wasn't one of those.
1656661	1658362	No, they've done, like, you know, Katamari.
1658382	1659382	Yeah, We Are Katamari.
1659402	1660603	I remember when we called the Target.
1660903	1662083	Yeah, and you know what?
1662303	1665384	And these companies, you know, they think that they're getting away with this shit.
1666704	1667764	You know, Nintendo will know.
1668025	1670405	I mean, it's just like, you know, Namco.
1670485	1673587	Namco is aware of the problem, you know, with We Heart Katamari.
1674267	1675267	Or not We Heart Katamari.
1675327	1676208	Yeah, We Heart Katamari.
1676448	1680970	And they basically, you know, those stores will not be getting their product on time.
1681030	1682870	Or they'll be getting it the day of or whatever.
1683270	1684411	They won't get it early anymore.
1684491	1688232	And that's not a good thing to do, to piss off Nintendo right before the Wii launch.
1688773	1692414	Because, you know, if they don't have it, people are going out of their places, so.
1693151	1693911	That's not good for them.
1694011	1695852	Yeah, that's what they did with GameStop and stuff.
1695892	1701095	When GameStop didn't have the pre-orders, people went to Best Buy, who didn't do pre-orders, and tried to get it that way.
1701895	1705477	Yeah, so, I mean, if you can find them early, great.
1705797	1707979	To be honest, it's just a redesign of the damn console.
1708019	1710560	I mean, do you really need one right away?
1711060	1711340	You don't.
1714202	1718504	I actually don't think they're any more comfortable to play than the US ones anyway, because of that sharp edge.
1720405	1720605	Okay.
1722673	1727540	DarkSakura, do you have any news about the colors of the systems that we're seeing?
1727560	1729782	Well, actually, in Europe, they're getting two colors.
1729983	1732446	They're getting black and white.
1734048	1736191	Pretty monochrome there.
1736711	1738133	Now, that's interesting, because we're only getting white.
1738353	1739054	Why do they get black?
1739535	1740156	Because they're special.
1741249	1743430	I guess getting screwed on the price finally.
1744231	1746492	Karma pays off for them because they always get screwed on prices.
1746512	1750534	Their price actually is going to be out on June 23rd in Europe.
1751014	1756257	Their price is £99.99 or €149.99.
1757917	1763360	Also, as far as some games that they're getting on June 30th, the new Super Mario Bros.
1763380	1763880	will be out.
1763960	1765441	Brain Training is on June 9th.
1765461	1768543	Nintendogs Dalmatian and Friends is on June 16th.
1768623	1770864	They're getting a Dalmatian one.
1771863	1775004	which is actually, I would be jealous if I even played my Nintendogs anymore.
1775944	1776224	Sorry.
1777484	1777764	All right.
1779364	1783025	Now, VidPower in our chat room reminds us that there actually is a Frapper map.
1783045	1785006	Horizons Radio has a Frapper map, too.
1785066	1788226	So if you're on Frapper, F-R-A-P-P-R dot com, look us up.
1788506	1791387	But you can also look up DS Lite Availability.
1791427	1792927	Just cram that all together into one word.
1793227	1796168	And they're actually checking targets to see if any have the DS Lite.
1796508	1797988	I already looked in this area and there are none.
1800179	1802160	I kind of want one, but I don't know.
1802180	1802500	We'll see.
1803160	1803460	We'll see.
1804800	1805060	Alright.
1806001	1808141	Moving on with more news.
1810282	1810542	Yes.
1810922	1817543	In other news, also Nintendo related, we've got information that the Wii is not going to have Dolby Digital out.
1818183	1820604	At least no 5.1 surround sound.
1820644	1825125	They will have ProLogic, which is still good, but I mean, I don't know.
1825365	1828826	I don't think you really need it since they're not going to be doing HD anyway, so...
1829673	1830634	Thank you for watching!
1850000	1853542	I guess, I don't know, I don't have Dolby Digital in my house anyway, so I don't care.
1853642	1859826	But, you know, I'm sure there's some people that will be kind of, hmm, but... Well, I'm kind of, uh... Well, you have Dolby Digital in my house.
1860006	1864309	Okay, well, literally, I mean, who... Okay, so you have it in your house.
1864489	1865390	Okay, that's great.
1865810	1870973	But, I mean, you have a ProLogic setup on yours, so it sounds great.
1871033	1871614	I mean, it sounds fine.
1871634	1873395	My receiver also has ProLogic, so...
1874162	1875323	It's not going to be the end of the world.
1875343	1879285	I mean, they're not supporting HD, true, I should say true HD or whatever anyway.
1879725	1884048	So, you know, as long as the games are fun, I'm not going to worry too much about the sound.
1884268	1888891	Plus, we already know there's a speaker in the controller, which is kind of, you know, can't really get that, 5.1 or not.
1890071	1891392	Digital 5.1, whatever.
1891752	1893894	You don't have the speaker in the controller, so...
1894614	1895274	Thanks for watching!
1907970	1909291	Is PlayStation 3 looking at it?
1909351	1910372	Is that another thing they're trying to do?
1910392	1916657	PlayStation 2 had optical digital audio out, so I wouldn't imagine that PlayStation 3 does as well.
1917098	1922202	Then again, that could be on one of those lists of things that they've scrapped for the price point.
1922362	1922662	I don't know.
1922803	1923443	I'm going to be honest.
1923483	1926125	I don't know a lot about audio setups.
1926145	1929728	The different types kind of go over my head a little bit, so it's interesting.
1930329	1930429	Hmm.
1931534	1933416	Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's Phil Harrison
1952533	1958619	In a way I understand why people say we stole Nintendo's idea, but it's a little stupid if you forgive the remark.
1958979	1964944	When we brought the PlayStation to the market in 1994, we introduced real-time 3D graphics for the first time.
1965384	1969608	When Nintendo launched its Nintendo 64 in 1996, it also had 3D graphics.
1970048	1971970	Did we say Nintendo stole our idea?
1972450	1973151	Obviously not.
1973291	1973972	Star Fox PC Engine Duo 3D
1991010	1991370	Exactly.
1991390	1993370	So they are pretty much full of crap.
1993390	1995531	Well, I'm surprised he's not actually researching it.
1995651	1996511	I've got two questions.
1996611	1999131	First, did Sony steal Nintendo's idea?
1999191	1999752	Why or why not?
2000252	2000852	I say no.
2001532	2001732	Okay.
2001952	2008173	I think they did something to make themselves competitive in that aspect, but I don't think they stole the idea.
2008993	2011053	How easy would it have been to just come out with a controller?
2011073	2011594	It was the same thing.
2011614	2017135	They tried something a little bit different, and although I'm not the biggest fan of the idea, I wouldn't say they stole it.
2017175	2019395	I think they just kind of tried to do something...
2019815	2020255	DarkSakura, Any?
2050504	2056126	Who's going to talk about who stole what from the Super Nintendo having been out?
2057487	2058247	It's business.
2058307	2060428	Companies steal from each other all the time.
2060448	2063169	I was going to say, remember when Vanilla Coke came out?
2063189	2066410	Because we all loved Vanilla Coke at the time when it first came out.
2066450	2067811	Vanilla Pepsi was a better product.
2067851	2069611	Vanilla Pepsi came out like two months later.
2069811	2070912	Is Pepsi a bunch of thieves?
2071032	2071852	No, that's what they do.
2072032	2073913	They always copy each other.
2074673	2078035	It's the point of business to find out other businesses' trade secrets and cash in on it.
2078415	2079135	Loki, you have a thought?
2079833	2084356	Yeah, okay, so they say, we didn't copy the way it's been in production for two years.
2085097	2089540	Two years ago, there was a game put out on Game Boy Advance called WarioWare Twisted.
2090140	2094243	They had the same kind of technology in there that has, you know, that's in the controller.
2094303	2097525	So, fuck you, Sony, you're still copying somebody.
2098066	2101949	You know, whether you want, first off, you got your facts wrong anyway, so it doesn't matter.
2102449	2103930	Okay, so they copied it.
2104349	2105769	Great, you know, whatever.
2105809	2113372	I mean, they've copied controller designs of the analog sticks and stuff from Nintendo 64, Rumble from Nintendo 64.
2113912	2114292	Big deal.
2114672	2121754	I mean, Xbox Live, they're going to be copying that for the PlayStation 3 online service or whatever.
2122782	2147982	it's what people like and so obviously you have to put it in your console but don't try to pass it off as this is an original idea that you came up with okay basically say yeah our competitions do it we need to do this in order to be competitive that's all you gotta say that is it pretty simple instead of being a jackass going we came up with it first no I don't think so so you know what great if it works for your console awesome
2148812	2154696	I think it's going to be stupid, and if they're going to be taking out the Rumble feature for this, I think it's a really bad trade-off.
2155537	2155837	Alright.
2156217	2159059	I've got to go to our chat room with some comments, because they're lit up right now a little bit.
2160060	2163503	Spiritsnare would like to point out, Pepsi Blue came out, but Coke Blue never did.
2164263	2167585	That's because Pepsi Blue was kind of crappy.
2167966	2169026	It was like Windex.
2169106	2169847	I didn't like it at all.
2169867	2172309	It tastes like Windex, and it made your poo change colors.
2173269	2174010	Thank you for sharing.
2175031	2175931	What else is there here?
2175951	2176432	Um...
2177551	2180933	There was something else I was going to... Oh, here it is.
2181013	2183614	O2G said maybe if they didn't implement it at the last minute.
2183954	2187957	Do you think maybe the whole last minute implementation of this is what makes them look like they're thieving here?
2188017	2188797	Yeah, it does.
2188937	2198082	And if they were saying that, oh yeah, this is something we're thinking about or something like that, that would be a little different, you know, if that was something they were toying around with.
2198482	2204946	But the fact that they brought it in, I mean, so what if they've been working on it for two years, we haven't heard anything about it, we haven't seen, you know,
2205796	2206237	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2225780	2226781	Warioware Sony Hate
2246428	2246708	I don't know.
2246728	2248790	Maybe if they put out a good product they'd earn our love.
2271511	2274775	Their system right now, they don't have a great lineup of games coming out.
2274895	2283063	Granted, okay, the system may be cool, but it's pumping out the same kind of graphics, same kind of gameplay as you're going to be getting on the Xbox 360, but it's more expensive.
2283504	2287388	And because they think that they need a Blu-ray drive in there because they're really trying to push this whole...
2288088	2291350	HD movie format on me.
2291610	2298813	I don't want to pay the extra $200 for this thing when I've just a few years ago replaced all my VHS with DVDs.
2299093	2300114	Now they want me to do this again?
2300234	2300514	Why?
2300934	2306777	I don't own an HD TV that's going to benefit from this, so why should I have to spend the extra $200 for it?
2307057	2310659	Plus they came out a year later, plus they're doing all these unoriginal ideas.
2310999	2311399	You know what?
2311539	2316942	If they do come out with some really good games like maybe a new Twisted Metal or something like that, that'd be great, but the whole thing
2318236	2325818	Sony is a great company and all, but even after the PSP came out and the launch games for that, the launch games were pitiful for the PSP.
2325978	2327319	They were all just rehashed.
2327739	2328199	You know what?
2328259	2329219	Twisted Metal head-on?
2329239	2331340	That's Twisted Metal 2 all over again.
2331560	2333180	Luminous being a glaring exception, though.
2333620	2335481	Well, yeah, but that's a third-party company, though.
2335501	2339682	That's a third-party... I mean, that game could have been made on the original PlayStation 2.
2340062	2342343	I mean, it's not something that really needed...
2342543	2343603	and the PlayStation Portable.
2363351	2370093	Let me interject here with some comments from chat, although some folks in chat are cheering you on there, BoyWonderZero and HintIrenee.
2370173	2374734	Funnydale is mentioning, if anyone should sue anyone, it should be Ralph Baer.
2374834	2379455	He was the guy who invented the idea for a home video game console and got almost nothing out of it himself.
2381056	2381656	Interesting thought.
2383176	2388497	I'll phrase a question towards DarkSakura, because I know you have not been a fan of Sony's PlayStation 3 stuff lately.
2389418	2390658	What could Sony do...
2391778	2395702	to win you over and you would be rah rah rah about this console on launch day.
2396063	2398325	What could they do between now and launch day to win you back?
2399026	2400267	Do we have time for me to list it?
2400648	2400888	Sure.
2401168	2402570	Take a couple if you've got it.
2402690	2403411	Well, okay.
2403731	2404932	First of all, drop the price.
2405693	2408056	Take out all of the unnecessary shit.
2408416	2409518	Take out the gyroscope.
2409578	2410559	We don't fucking need it.
2411810	2416153	You know, we don't need high def that not every system is going to be able to manage.
2416393	2418014	We don't need two HDMI ports.
2418274	2419655	Maybe one HDMI port.
2420175	2423857	You know, enough to, you know, because how many people are going to hook up two HDMI ports?
2423877	2425058	I think they only have one now.
2425078	2426339	They did scale it back to one.
2426359	2426779	Okay, good.
2426959	2428200	Okay, leave in the HDMI.
2428800	2432963	But allow me to point out that the low-end system will not even have the HDMI at all.
2433343	2433543	I know.
2433563	2434083	Right, okay.
2434203	2434564	I know this.
2434924	2436805	I wouldn't waste my money on a low-end system.
2437826	2437986	But...
2439565	2468363	they need to, you know the memory stick thing it's nice but they should have made them use the memory sticks from the beginning or a USB thing, you know they should have had something more universal that would last, if their vision was that big they should have had it last from system to system or they should at very least use the PS2 memory cards, you know there's price reduction right there they don't need to process the polys that they're saying that they can, no one is really going to care
2469385	2476488	You know, they need to make sure that the games they put on there, first of all, take care of the whole anti-aliasing issue that you've had ever since the days of the PS1.
2477048	2478088	You know, fix that.
2479209	2482610	You know, um... Oh, God, I've got such a list in my head right now.
2482630	2483730	That's right, Loki 1 Interject, anyway.
2483870	2485671	There's something else I liked about the PlayStation 2.
2486451	2488272	The old controllers worked on the system.
2488612	2489413	I bought the system.
2489453	2491074	I spent the $300 or whatever.
2491394	2493855	I did not have to go out and buy new hookups.
2494136	2496157	It used the same hookups as the PlayStation 1.
2496437	2498018	I didn't have to buy new controllers.
2498538	2502841	Granted, it came with one, but I didn't have to go out and buy a second one to play two-player games.
2503201	2505382	I had that already because I already owned the system.
2506503	2509004	Devil's Advocate, Xbox 360 didn't do that for you.
2509565	2509985	No, it didn't.
2510525	2512146	Yeah, you can use your Xbox controllers.
2512707	2513127	No, you can't.
2513267	2513347	No.
2514062	2514883	F1 Racing for the PS3 has...
2537569	2540310	Use the wing mirror basically as the PSP.
2540910	2541930	You don't need that.
2542070	2544651	That is a stupid example of the technology.
2545831	2551272	I'm going to ask one more question and then I want to get back to the news because we've spent an awful lot of time on this unplanned Sony discussion.
2551432	2552652	Here's my last thought.
2554393	2558454	Should Sony push back the release of this to save themselves?
2558534	2559054	Yes or no?
2559134	2560514	They're going to have to, I think.
2561826	2562807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2582739	2583039	Gears of War
2603647	2606109	and just a lot of really big stuff that's coming out for the 360.
2607230	2615115	If you delay it any further, like into spring, people are already going to be snapping up the Xbox 360 and they'll say to hell with the PS3.
2616616	2625082	Although, if they do launch the PS3 now, you're going to get a lot of unfinished games, you're going to get a lot of things that may not work right, and it's going to be one big clusterfuck.
2625387	2625587	GK128 PS3 in 2006?
2625627	2626687	I'll eat my hat if that happens!
2648634	2652677	Let's see, Legend of Zaku says they need it to live or Nintendo will eat them alive.
2653537	2655118	Boy Wonder Zero says they can't do it.
2656199	2660662	Bandit says the PlayStation 3 is too next-gen for this gen.
2662183	2666285	And Sakurina says recap, fuck next-generation consoles, go retro.
2667466	2667706	Okay.
2669087	2672329	Well, I guess the Dreamcast is having a resurgence from what I understand, but anyway.
2672605	2676326	We need to get back into some more news here, so let's keep it on moving here.
2676966	2678346	Loki, you have some news on the Wii.
2678706	2688608	Yes, also basically one of the big things about the Wii was that this Wii Connect 24 service that they're going to be having, they'll basically allow you to have updates.
2688688	2700050	Well, some of the things that they're talking about is daily content, and this can be anything from DS demos to movies, etc.
2700331	2702431	Just basically new content each day for you.
2703576	2704316	I think that's great.
2704556	2706537	I don't think that's going to happen.
2706597	2713618	That's maybe a bit optimistic, but definitely I like the idea of having DS demos on there so you can actually play that.
2714958	2715478	That's pretty cool.
2715638	2718019	That's something that Sony should copy, to be honest.
2718079	2722800	I mean, PS3 downloadable demos, that'd be a really good thing.
2723620	2733202	So hopefully, the other thing though is, I mean, granted there's only limited storage on this thing, hopefully they'll have some way to turn this off in case you don't want it, because
2733663	2734364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2759182	2762585	and that they are licensing to PC manufacturers right now.
2762605	2766908	And we set up our launch title as Duke Nukem Forever.
2768369	2769290	Might sell some systems.
2769490	2773073	But it's supposed to be actually an on-demand game service.
2773883	2777305	Deliver the games to the system in the living room through online memes.
2778926	2782328	So correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like GameTap on your TV, in a way.
2782348	2785930	Not with classic titles, but with new games.
2786270	2787270	That's what it's looking like.
2788391	2792133	But they've changed their launch date now from mid-2006 to October.
2793114	2798517	Their new CEO is basically going in saying that they're really pushing it.
2798557	2800998	They're trying to get the Phantom Lapboard out worldwide.
2801098	2803840	Which is a combination keyboard and mouse.
2804821	2809165	And they're saying it's on schedule for first arrivals in October for the US market.
2809985	2813888	But right now they're running at a $70 million loss.
2815069	2816811	No product created.
2816851	2819913	Maybe this is why Nintendo's afraid to announce the launch date for the Wii.
2819933	2821975	Because they're shaking in their boots over this Phantom launch.
2822315	2824217	I mean, that's a hell of a... What?
2824577	2824817	No.
2824977	2825257	I know.
2825438	2826919	Okay, here's what they need to do with the Phantom.
2826939	2827139	Okay, what?
2827734	2833603	If you really want to put this out and actually be successful with it and you're talking about on-demand service,
2834131	2836853	Why don't you pitch it to cable companies?
2837153	2843998	Cable companies now are starting to do this on-demand crap where you can download movies and karaoke and stuff like that.
2844459	2845139	Why not games?
2845480	2851564	Just soup up their hardware right now and offer games where you can download them on-demand and play them.
2851664	2852665	You want to know something weird?
2853025	2854646	Cable companies did this in the 80s.
2854826	2859290	And I don't know if it was something that was just being tested locally in this market, but my cable box back in like...
2859870	2871995	Back when the only system we had was the Atari 2600, this is before the launch of the NES, we're talking that long ago, you could get games on demand, like poker and stuff, that had better graphics than the Atari 2600, and use your remote.
2872395	2873616	For some reason, that never took off.
2874216	2875136	Remember the Satellaview?
2876057	2876797	I didn't have that.
2877076	2880277	Well, the Satellaview is what they had in Japan for the Super Nintendo.
2880537	2881037	Oh, okay.
2881357	2887078	The Zelda Satellaview, which is actually, in my opinion, the best version of the first Zelda game ever.
2887338	2892539	I remember back in the day when they had the Sega Channel, and that was okay, but it was slow as hell.
2892679	2895260	Nowadays, though, with everything being broadband, I think they should do that.
2895500	2897340	They do this in hotel rooms right now, too.
2897480	2898400	Oh, yeah, I see chat rooms.
2898420	2899761	They have Xbox Arcade.
2900741	2901481	It's the same difference.
2903233	2903533	Okay.
2904013	2910215	But I think that's something that they should really do, because in that way, you know, oh, I don't want to buy a game console, but, you know, maybe this game service or whatever.
2910576	2914697	GameTap should fucking go in the business with these people, and, you know, I think that'd be good, too.
2914817	2916437	But, I don't know.
2916978	2926881	It's really where they need to be going, because the Phantom console as, like, a PC on-demand thing, people have done it for cheaper and better, so, yeah.
2926901	2927181	All right.
2928072	2929854	Well, let's keep it moving here.
2929874	2932056	I want to talk about the ESRB for a minute.
2932716	2935359	Penny Arcade is actually teaming up with ESRB.
2935399	2936240	This is kind of interesting.
2937161	2946830	Gabe from Penny Arcade wrote that they have been signed by the ESRB to put together a new advertising campaign meant to educate gamers about the ESRB's rating systems.
2946870	2949612	It's going to show up in magazines and websites and all that stuff.
2950613	2951554	I think that's kind of interesting.
2951634	2952015	I like...
2952981	2959805	Penny Arcade has a very funny approach to social issues sometimes, so I'll be very curious to see what they come up with for this ESRB.
2959865	2961106	I think it'll be very creative.
2961346	2962947	There's some very creative guys over there.
2962967	2966569	Well, you remember they actually had a little thing teasing at it at E3.
2966589	2970311	You probably saw those pillars that they had with the characters.
2970671	2981277	So I think any way to get the message out there is great, especially if it's something that parents can be able to use and so there's less confusion on
2981718	2983439	The ESRB works as the parents that need to be educated.
2983459	2985400	So let's hope whatever they're working on is geared towards parents.
3007290	3015676	But I would say if it's educated, if it's aimed at gamers talking to parents about what they're playing, I think that's not a bad thing either.
3016076	3018979	But, I don't know, that would be kind of a hard thing to market.
3019019	3021781	But, you know, at Penny Arcade, they're creative, they can come up with something, I'm sure.
3023702	3028225	Moving on, let's go on over to Loki, who has news on another video game law.
3028625	3031988	Yep, and this one's in, it's been passed in Minnesota.
3032768	3035971	Their last, latest state law is basically...
3037469	3043572	Finding, and this is interesting, finding the people that buy the game and not the sellers of the games.
3044192	3052656	So basically, if you're a miner and you live in Minnesota and you happen to purchase an emirated game, well, the blame's going to fall on your hands.
3052696	3055017	You're going to be fined $25 for that.
3055278	3055998	That's smart.
3056630	3058233	I think it's a great idea.
3058253	3059616	That's the right approach to take.
3060116	3061519	Really, whose responsibility is it?
3061539	3062821	It's the person who's paying out the money.
3063202	3064043	They want the product.
3064103	3067469	The game retailer, why should they parent other people's children for them?
3068530	3070171	So I'm fully in support of that.
3070732	3073714	Basically, they're saying that they're not trying to punish gamers.
3074775	3081240	And basically, if you do get caught doing this and get fined, it would not go on your record.
3081340	3083441	It's just you'd be fined $25.
3084102	3088325	The other thing, though, is they were saying that they don't know how they're going to enforce it, which is, I don't know.
3088545	3088985	It's interesting.
3089065	3090066	I think it's the right approach.
3090086	3095130	You know, punish the people buying the games or maybe even the parents, you know, because
3096141	3096481	I don't know.
3096521	3100823	Maybe the fine should be, well, I don't know if it's a little bit too, you know, the right price point or not.
3101164	3112389	Maybe a little bit higher of a fine would be a bit better, but I guess it's sort of a step in the right direction instead of, you know, just trying to say, oh, let's ban all bad video games type thing.
3113010	3113310	All right.
3114715	3134387	Speaking of bad things and games doing bad things to children, an affiliate of Fox, a Fox 9 TV station, further proving that the media does not get games sometimes, they ran a story recently that talked about how children are using a game device to access porn out of thin air.
3134987	3137029	The gaming device in question, the PSP.
3137569	3140711	And of course, if you consider that the PSP can access the internet...
3141211	3144093	and that if you listen to Avenue Q, the internet is for porn.
3144874	3148497	This does not make any surprise at all that you can download porn on your PSP.
3148777	3158004	This kind of reminds me of that other story that ran not that long ago about how predators can pick up children in PictoChat, whereas I never find people chatting in PictoChat.
3158344	3160846	This is just kind of one of those, is this really news?
3161547	3167411	I mean, if you really understand that the PSP gets on the internet and you can get anything on the internet,
3168183	3168824	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3188376	3189397	Well, you know what?
3189517	3198184	It's easy to blame Fox and use that whole thing, but really, I think there's a lot of uneducated media folks out there in general.
3198584	3204969	I think it's easy to pick on Fox in this case, but... My favorite, though, was the Penny Arcade response to the whole thing.
3205269	3206490	Oh, with the calculator?
3206550	3207971	The edge of sketch in the calculator.
3207991	3208732	That was great.
3210253	3211574	Your calculator can say boobs.
3212975	3227822	Speaking of porn, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down all day long for porn, but once in a while she stumbles upon a site she wants to share with you in a little segment we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
3228182	3230463	DarkSakura, where should the kids be surfing to this week?
3231485	3240048	Today's website of the week is... Actually, I had one, and then there was another one that I had found earlier that I'm going to stick with because of the article I found on it.
3240108	3241928	It's at livescience.com.
3242568	3251371	If you're going to this URL, it's livescience.com slash technology slash 050201 underscore cell underscore danger dot html.
3251851	3255252	Basically, it's talking about how drivers on cell phones kill thousands of people.
3256349	3258151	All the more reason to take old people off the road.
3276912	3285857	Cell phone distractions cause 2,600 deaths and 330,000 injuries in the United States every year, according to the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.
3286577	3300224	Drivers talking on cell phones are 18% slower to react to brake lights, and they're also 12% greater following distance, at least that's one thing good, but they also took 17% longer to regain speed once they had a brake.
3300802	3303744	I mean, basically, it slows down your reaction time.
3303824	3306706	It makes you a danger to yourself and everybody else on the road.
3307067	3309989	So I suggest that everybody read this article and hang up your goddamn phone.
3311810	3312450	Everyone should read this.
3312510	3313271	It's my side of the week.
3314472	3314932	Alright.
3315733	3320436	And if you want to call me to talk about this, I'll be driving to the bay tonight, so I'll have plenty of time to talk.
3321297	3321757	Just kidding.
3322472	3323433	I'm dead serious about it.
3323534	3334450	I think it's... Having known someone who lost her child because the other driver was talking on her cell phone when she ran him over, then yeah, I definitely am very much against it.
3335611	3335912	Alright.
3336313	3337434	Going back to games now.
3338297	3342021	Loki, and the continuing saga of the Wii release date.
3342041	3343042	You know what I think is interesting?
3343643	3351190	If you check dig.com out this week, some story that was speculating like a November 11th launch or something got like a thousand digs or something.
3351691	3360059	And it kind of struck me as amazing because they, not to knock the story, but their source was kind of like some guy anonymously told us.
3360860	3389397	and you know I realize that you know our source to some people doesn't seem much better and that's fine but I was just kind of surprised that everybody seemed to be going they were jumping at that date based off of shaky evidence well Loki has further evidence that seems to point towards October take it with a grain of salt if you want but here it is and I'd like to preface something real quick I saw there was a little story on GameSpot this week talking about Activision's upcoming titles for the fourth quarter including some titles like Pimp My Ride the Game
3390387	3397187	and some Cabela's Alaskan Hunt game or something like that and other stuff.
3398406	3402629	You do remember way back when I talked about this months ago.
3403429	3403669	I do.
3404510	3405610	When was that one event?
3405810	3408752	It was during Destination PlayStation in Florida.
3408792	3409813	They announced all this stuff.
3410113	3411153	Did anyone pay attention to that?
3411353	3411634	No.
3411914	3418317	Download the show the week of Destination PlayStation that we did, and you'll hear Loki saying this.
3418417	3426322	Seriously, I get this information, and nobody pays attention to it until a big site comes and repeats the same thing, and then everyone's like, oh, okay.
3426742	3429724	So anyways, more Wii dates, of course, and guess what?
3429784	3431145	They're all around the same time again.
3431825	3434767	And this time we've got Activision and Ubisoft.
3434807	3437648	A little bit bigger companies out there should know when the Wii's coming out.
3438269	3446293	Granted, some of their games, though, like, for example, Call of Duty 3, that is on the launch date, which is great.
3448149	3450433	I didn't even know Call of Duty was coming to the Wii.
3450453	3454901	Oh, I mentioned that also on that same podcast about Destination PlayStation.
3454961	3456304	Why didn't they show that at E3?
3456905	3459149	They did, sort of, in movie form.
3459289	3460852	It was a pre-rendered movie.
3460872	3461233	It was like, eh.
3461877	3464278	Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam Rayman 4
3483650	3501899	and then Marvel Ultimate Alliance also coming out actually to coincide with the PlayStation 3 launch because that's being launched in every single system that day on November 16th so there's some more games for you granted not all of them are on October 18th but
3503188	3509789	I think we still haven't gotten a lot of the company's stuff yet and obviously you're not going to be just announcing stuff for launch.
3509809	3512310	You're going to be launching with more titles.
3512350	3515550	It's still within the launch window and it's about a week away from the thing.
3516230	3527612	I'm still sticking with October 18th and I will be laughing my ass off when this does come out on October 18th or when they come out with the news that we're launching it on the anniversary of the original Nintendo.
3527632	3529073	Okay, what if it doesn't turn out that way though?
3529093	3530653	What if they do come out and say it's November 11th?
3530713	3531373	What are you going to do?
3531775	3532815	Well, then, good.
3532875	3533916	It's coming out November 11th.
3533976	3534656	But you know what?
3534976	3543919	I think it's coming out this date, and granted, there's powers that may not be able to make it at this launch date.
3543939	3548081	Things can delay stuff, but it's too convenient not to happen.
3550742	3552663	There's too many coincidences.
3552923	3553283	Seriously.
3554412	3560439	With, you know, more and more publishers every day, every week, you know, agreeing that this is a time frame.
3560519	3562362	Notice all these dates aren't all in November.
3562502	3566647	They're not all hovering around November like it would be coming out in November.
3566707	3571733	So it's definitely, okay, definitely in October and most likely on the 18th.
3573235	3574575	Alright, we'll see.
3575896	3580236	DarkSakura, now you have some definite for sure release dates to share with us, correct?
3580516	3581316	I sure do.
3581436	3583877	But now this isn't for the US, these are for the UK.
3583897	3587638	Because screw the UK, I mean... You do live here.
3587918	3589178	I know, damn it.
3589418	3596759	Okay, this is the release dates for our UK listeners coming up on the 9th of the following games.
3597259	3600060	We have Zoo Tycoon 2... Oh, sorry, that was the second.
3600540	3600600	Uh...
3602060	3625759	F-117A Stealth Fighter on PC is coming out Namco Museum 50th Anniversary on GameCube Sensible Soccer 2006 on PC Xbox, Playstation 2 and Talkman on PSP Also on the 13th we have Culpa Inata on PC That's though going to be the following Monday Alright, Loki do you have anything in the US?
3626140	3631404	Yeah, there's lots of fun stuff coming out this coming week here Of course
3632330	3634692	Actually, you know, it's kind of getting to a dead part of the month.
3634732	3637633	Urban Chaos, Riot Response is supposed to be coming out.
3639094	3640515	Actually, that would be the following week.
3641476	3644678	This week, though, we have Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories on PlayStation 2.
3645438	3646379	And that should be good.
3646399	3649360	Unfortunately, there isn't multiplayer on it, so that kind of sucks.
3649821	3656004	But also, we've got Ant 1 Streetball coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
3656485	3657645	I believe I talked about this last week.
3657906	3661728	Gradius Collection is going to be coming out on the PSP.
3662366	3663226	which is pretty awesome.
3664106	3674749	And then, of course, like I said, the following week, Urban Chaos, Right Response on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology on the PlayStation 2 as well.
3675549	3681431	And, unfortunately, if you're waiting for 360 games, there's only going to be one this month, and that would be MotoGP 2006.
3682891	3687512	Hopefully, there'll be some more Xbox Live games, arcade games to go with that.
3688292	3689073	Hopefully, Luminous.
3689933	3690413	I'm hoping.
3691704	3692544	Hopefully anything.
3692624	3695385	Live's been kind of dead since E3 with Uno.
3695685	3696645	All you need is Uno.
3697145	3699746	Uno's really the only game that's really come out in quite a while.
3699886	3707088	And I realize Uno's a pretty good release, but after hearing some of the stuff they teased at E3, I'm like, come on, bring on the Contra, bring on the Luminous.
3707108	3711950	Well, I've got a few more things real quick, because there's been some shuffling going around, obviously.
3712790	3713790	DDR's been moving.
3715210	3715751	Oh, really?
3715951	3716491	DDR moved?
3716531	3717011	What happened?
3717331	3719031	Well, you know, dates change.
3719252	3720352	So let's
3721277	3723479	Get caught up here with what's been going on.
3724059	3732225	DDR Supernova, not coming out on the 13th, but coming out on the 2nd now of September.
3732585	3733686	So that's pretty good.
3734487	3735488	They moved that up a bit.
3735908	3741732	And of course, Supernova also, I believe, moved up.
3742613	3746676	And it's now coming out, let's see here, it was in October.
3749058	3750719	Actually, also...
3751332	3755493	One game that did get delayed, Final Fantasy XII, coming out on October 11th now.
3756274	3756914	So that kind of sucks.
3757634	3760135	But, um... Wait a minute.
3761015	3761436	Wait a minute.
3761936	3767077	Could that be more... Could that be something else to show that there's competition with the Wii there?
3767458	3772339	Because didn't Dragon Quest VIII get shuffled to come out right on the same day as the Xbox 360?
3774240	3774640	Maybe?
3774980	3776421	I don't know.
3776461	3777221	It wasn't a very good...
3777992	3781353	Yeah, I wasn't very good to... But Final Fantasy XII is a great counter-title.
3781493	3782494	That's... Okay.
3782714	3783194	Interesting.
3783234	3785535	I'm sorry, not super... Universe.
3786315	3788876	Ultraman XIV, October 2nd now.
3789136	3791957	So that got pushed up a little bit the same day as Elebits.
3792737	3793458	So that's kind of cool.
3794298	3805042	And then, of course, we have for the 360 Universe, which is now November 2nd.
3806959	3811761	So, yeah, they're really aiming on the second for a lot of these.
3812341	3814302	Lots of good games coming out, though, in the fall, that's for sure.
3815283	3816123	That's kind of weird.
3816223	3817604	Why would they all get shifted to the second?
3817644	3818904	Are those all even Tuesdays?
3819424	3820105	Why would they do that?
3820305	3821345	They don't come out on Tuesdays.
3821405	3822986	It's usually Wednesdays and stuff.
3823446	3824306	Huh, okay.
3824667	3828288	Are you sure it's not going to change again next week?
3828448	3828908	Oh, I could.
3829108	3834931	I mean, I'm never certain about dates until it actually gets to the week of, and even then I'm not certain sometimes.
3835945	3841996	Alright, but, you know, when it comes down to Konami, they tend to really keep about the same dates for stuff.
3842455	3842655	DarkSakura
3873456	3873576	Yep.
3873616	3873736	And, um...
3891084	3905108	Tomb Raider Legend is at number 5, 6th place X-Men The Official Game, Da Vinci Code is at 8, Animal Crossing Wild World at number 7, that actually moved up from number 9, and Sims 2 is at number 10.
3905188	3912271	Some of the debuts that came out though was Rise of Nations, Rise of Legends at 37, Super Princess Peach at 29.
3913991	3916012	Basically DS titles though all over the place.
3918030	3920992	They're speculating that the new Super Mario Bros.
3921052	3923713	is going to really show up high as well as brain training.
3927015	3928235	So that's how it's looking right now.
3928636	3929796	Apparently they love Hitman.
3930457	3930777	Alright.
3931437	3931977	Oh, it is new.
3932218	3934659	They mentioned in the chat that September 2nd is a Saturday.
3935199	3936960	I don't know about that, Loki.
3937000	3939241	I think somebody made a boo-boo.
3939281	3940962	So I take that with a huge grain of salt.
3941122	3943283	I think it's going to go back to the way it was next week.
3943664	3946145	So it just goes to show your database is not always foolproof.
3947409	3949411	It's not, but they're pretty close.
3949551	3954274	Top Xbox 360 and Xbox Live games are out thanks to Major Nelson.
3954614	3955775	You want to know what folks are playing on the 360?
3955815	3958117	The number one game, Call of Duty 2.
3958217	3959357	Number two, Ghost Recon 3.
3959758	3960798	Number three, Oblivion.
3962019	3966322	All the way on down to number ten, Hitman Blood Money demo making a new entry there on the chart.
3966362	3968383	Rockstar Table Tennis coming in at number seven.
3969104	3972506	The top games on the original Xbox, number one, Halo 2, of course.
3972946	3974608	Number two, Battlefield 2.
3974928	3976549	And number three, Counter-Strike.
3976969	3980810	all the way on down to Ghost Recon 2 at number 10.
3981571	3984472	The rest of the titles, not a lot of new stuff there on the original Xbox.
3986672	3990174	Alright, I wanted to share with you guys a story coming in from Japan.
3990214	3991994	We were talking about the ESRB earlier.
3992374	3999137	Well, the CERO is Japan's equivalent, and they have a new rating system that they're going to use.
3999437	4002678	They have two separate ratings for M-type games.
4003638	4016864	A title gets what's called a D. Basically, there's letters A, B, C, D, and Z. A title gets a D rating if it's 17 years and older, and the Z rating is for adults 18 and up.
4017464	4018805	So that's kind of interesting.
4019545	4022827	If you want to know the type of games that are getting a Z rating right now, you have Killer7,
4023747	4028451	Max Payne, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, The Getaway, Berserk.
4029232	4037939	D-rated games, as in the 17 and older, you have things like Fable, Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive 4, God of War, Rumble Roses.
4038520	4040141	Kind of interesting, this system they have there.
4040161	4040602	I like that.
4040822	4043124	It's A, B, C, D, and Z.
4044178	4047900	Where I guess C is 15 and up and B is 12 and up and A is everybody.
4048120	4054663	That's like the movie rating system because 15 is basically their equivalent of the PG-13.
4054703	4055123	Yeah.
4056383	4059265	Like Battle Royale, for example, was a 15 and up movie.
4059485	4059705	Hmm.
4060565	4060685	Okay.
4062126	4064927	I always said for a long time we should just mirror the movie system here.
4065107	4068149	I'm surprised that Berserk was mentioned being that that's an old Dreamcast title.
4068529	4069269	Yeah.
4069409	4072371	And then again, though, it was pretty violent anime and manga.
4072391	4073071	Right.
4074146	4077309	Loki, are we going to be seeing gaming at the Olympics soon?
4077349	4078130	I hope not.
4078970	4082293	Then again, I've seen weird stuff come to the Olympics, so who knows.
4082654	4096085	But according to GameSpot, actually, the founder of the Global Gaming League is trying to get gaming as a demo sport in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and basically is
4096892	4099373	I don't want to see gaming as an Olympic event.
4127481	4128482	Thanks for watching!
4144184	4145625	No, it's not an event.
4146186	4146726	Not at all.
4146826	4150389	Unless they come out with a game that involves running around the goddamn track.
4150769	4154592	That is not even close to being a sport, okay?
4154973	4159696	If they want to test someone's athletic ability, you've got the floor exercises for gymnastics.
4161178	4162899	DDR is nothing compared to that.
4163159	4166862	Breakdancing would be a better sport than gaming.
4168463	4172307	And of course we have the classic witty retort from the chatroom that DDR is a sport in the Netherlands.
4172327	4172547	Norway.
4172567	4172847	Norway.
4175202	4186767	Good for them Norway doesn't count Moving on DarkSakura, you have some news on Half-Life Do I?
4187187	4203233	Well, you know what Half-Life is That's what the notes say I was being witty I know DarkSakura needs food badly Don't shoot food No
4204089	4207192	Seriously, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 is out.
4208052	4214417	Released at 6pm in the UK on June 1st.
4214438	4216839	Sorry, I'm all backwards today.
4216979	4217960	Basically, it's...
4225009	4226750	It's about, people can play it.
4227850	4235654	And you actually can, they actually had it available for a pre-purchase as well too.
4236975	4244178	But now you can pre-load it for $19.95 or you can buy it from scratch and download it.
4245679	4248320	But right now though, they're saying the servers are pretty loaded on it.
4250601	4250861	Okay.
4252395	4252535	E.A.
4252675	4254397	is distributing the game for £15.
4268228	4273634	It's basically to Guitar Hero what Stepmania was to DDR.
4273694	4275196	Free Tar Hero is released.
4275256	4276497	It's available at a site.
4277278	4283745	It's called, I'm going to have to spell this for you guys, antonstruyk.com.
4284586	4286187	FreeTar, FreeTar
4312731	4313532	TAR HERO
4331351	4333872	Some things are being developed for an old platform.
4334172	4345837	Yes, the Dreamcast, which is ironic because actually iGen's been doing this thing now where they're re-revealing every single Dreamcast game that's ever been made and starting off with a lot of games.
4346477	4358741	But according to Dreamcast Scene, actually, Goat Store Publishing firm has announced that they have plans to release 10 more games for the Dreamcast over the next year and a half.
4359562	4359902	And that's...
4360745	4361605	Thank you for watching!
4386583	4388184	Dreamcast Dreamcast Dreamcast Dreamcast Dreamcast
4416857	4444229	Well, here's some of the games right now, and I don't know if these are going to be too exciting, but Feet of Fury 2, remember that DDR clone that they had for the Dreamcast, Donk, a Cryptic Illusions remake of the CDI game, DC, or DCastle, Age of the Beast Special Edition, which is basically a clone of Altered, not Altered Beast, um,
4444909	4445529	I can't remember.
4445609	4450751	It's very similar to that Beats of Rage that came out a while back, which is the Streets of Rage clone.
4451491	4454612	Amnesia Adventure Game, a new graphic adventure.
4454632	4474138	Let's see, a new adventure game from SF Software, a remake of a cancelled Lynx game inspired by Tempest 2000, a new 3D fighter using the Quake engine, Samurai Warrior using the enhanced Beats of Rage engine, and let's see,
4474790	4478251	Project Firestorm Shmup Super Mario Bros 2.5D
4496260	4496821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4517539	4521260	One of their staff reviewed it and said they played it for about 30 seconds.
4521420	4524942	Aside from being hideously ugly, the game is sort of floaty feeling.
4525242	4526822	None of the snappiness of the original.
4527102	4528583	And the levels are not identical either.
4528643	4530544	It's a cute idea but needs some serious work.
4530804	4533785	And so in case you're wondering where you can download this, www.plunder.com slash super-mario-bros-2-5d
4546969	4549990	I saved the best for last for this break.
4550010	4551651	Loki, you have a story about Mac fans.
4572205	4575167	And, well, their answer...
4602003	4603784	Mac users aren't really into games.
4606264	4610165	And so, yeah, we're not quite sure.
4610185	4617566	I don't know if it entirely addresses the state of Mac gaming, but yeah, that's why.
4617767	4619967	Mac users don't really like games.
4621707	4622808	And that's according to who again?
4623288	4624228	It's according to Business Week.
4624448	4627469	All right, just making sure you get your source out there when all the hate mail starts coming in for you.
4627489	4629169	Business Week says you don't like games.
4631249	4632830	Alright, not surprising.
4634552	4638155	Rini in our chatroom, who I know is a Mac fan, says, whoever wrote that isn't trying.
4638495	4639256	They're not trying.
4641037	4641998	Fuck you, Business Week.
4645726	4648449	Alright, we're going to go to a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
