14079	21485	Tonight, June 18th, 2006, Xbox 360 gets more backwards compatibility, but someone's pissed you still can't play Psychonauts.
21645	26369	Rumors that Grand Theft Auto 4 will be an MMO, and could the PS3 end up in a vending machine?
27930	37918	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
38058	41421	It's that podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about...
42083	42984	I'm here to help you do that.
43044	48789	My name is Rob Roberts, but we cannot forget the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also here every week.
48970	49670	Yo, what up?
50010	50531	How you doing?
51091	51452	Pretty good.
51952	52293	Alrighty.
52593	56236	And also here every single week, say hello to the one and only Loki.
56436	56737	Hello.
57057	57457	How you doing?
57818	58018	Good.
58498	58839	Awesome.
59679	60760	Alright, well, here we are.
60860	63583	It's episode number 187, so you know what that means.
63603	65585	We're going to have a murderous good time tonight on the show.
66386	67907	That's a joke somewhere in there.
68864	76910	Yes, and we're going to start right here, live on the air, as we participate in a co-host battle royale, of which I'll win, because I'm vicious.
77430	78271	Why would we do that?
78771	80152	I don't know, because it'd be good ratings.
80952	81633	I don't want to die.
81653	83294	We'll fake it.
83394	87457	For those who were listening live last week, we were talking about the Americanization of battle royale a little bit.
87477	89758	I don't remember if it was after the show or in the middle or something.
89778	93921	We were talking about Americanization of battle royale, and that whole thought still makes me kind of sad.
94081	94462	I don't know.
94602	96163	It's just, they're not going to get it right.
96283	97224	You know they're not going to get it right.
97244	97924	It is.
98803	103447	Completely just makes me want to go crawl into the corner and cry for an hour.
104408	105669	I hope it's a rumor.
105850	107551	I hope it's a sick, sad rumor.
107971	108532	It's not a rumor.
108572	109473	It's not the rumor.
110714	111194	Tumor.
111974	113835	Anyway, also... Yeah, the movie will be a tumor.
114335	117796	Also say hello to our invisible fourth guest, but they're really there.
118236	121637	It's our chat room over at www.orangelondradio.com.
121657	122317	Click on chat.
122737	123978	It's your guys' show, too.
124238	126258	We love to put in your comments and everything.
126498	128659	And I'll tell you what, we have some sick fans.
129459	131480	Because I was just talking to one before the show tonight.
131500	133260	We have somebody from the UK who's listening tonight.
133380	135481	So say hello to DigiNova, listening for the first time.
135601	135941	Hello.
135961	138642	I think there was somebody else in there that said they were listening for the first time tonight as well.
138662	139062	I think it was...
140171	145715	Anoshi, and I apologize if I butchered that name, Anoshi, Anoshi, also listening for the first time tonight.
145775	146795	Not from the UK, but still.
148036	149297	Thanks to you guys for listening.
149317	154480	Of course, a big hello to everybody in there tonight, listening for the first time, the hundredth time, or whatever the case may be.
155721	157422	Let's talk about our gaming week.
157442	159824	We always like to start off the show talking about the games we've been playing.
160024	161145	DarkSakura, start us off.
161905	165167	I played a number of things over the course of this week.
165187	169550	I got my DS Lite after the show, and so I've been playing Animal Crossing again this week.
170664	179936	And I've also been playing the, on the Japanese website, LocoRoco.jp, they have the demo for LocoRoco for PSP.
180577	182299	And I've been playing the hell out of that today.
183140	183961	And Osu!
183982	187246	Tatakai Oendan today, which is actually harder than I thought it would be.
187944	189366	When's Krista coming to the show?
210606	213827	You know, I tried to get her to come tonight, but she had to drive back to Davis.
214127	215947	When you two get together, it's comedy gold.
216447	217587	So we need her on the show.
217607	219928	Maybe she'll come for the big four-year anniversary next week.
220408	222228	We're having a fourth birthday party.
222508	227549	We're celebrating our... We're celebrating our... That was great radio, by the way, when you held up your fingers.
228189	230349	We're celebrating our entrance into preschool next week.
230389	230909	It should be fun.
231250	231570	Yeah.
232470	234110	I'm trying to find people to come next week.
235490	236950	But yeah, that's... Oh, yeah.
237111	239851	I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back down because I was like, eh.
242299	246321	I don't want to play I don't have the time to LFP I don't have the time for this today
271913	275356	I think there's better things to do with my time than to immerse myself into an MMO.
275436	278639	I don't know what you hear about my gaming week, but we'll get to that in a minute.
278779	279080	Addict.
280861	281762	Addict!
281882	282303	Anything else?
283123	283564	No.
284104	285285	How's that LocoRoco?
285586	286566	It's crack.
287187	288148	I love the music.
288348	289069	It's on drugs.
289289	298057	I went to the website for LocoRoco a few weeks ago, because they have a mini version of the game all in Flash, and I thought the music was so adorable.
298900	299240	It's cute.
299320	308106	It is really cute, but it's really frustrating because I find myself trying to tilt the PSP upside down, trying to tilt the world and trying to get it to go.
308426	313229	And then you get up to the moon and it's like, no, you have to have twice as many pieces of your body as you have now.
313649	314449	Well, crap.
314729	315930	And then you fall down the little hole.
315950	319632	When you split into multiple pieces, you fall down the hole and then something comes in and eats part of you.
320393	322714	It's like, no, you're not supposed to do that.
322754	323355	Spit me out.
324375	325816	And then that's it.
326443	330144	That game reminds me of an old-ass Super Nintendo game called On the Ball.
330544	331184	Did you ever play that?
331224	340386	It was like, it whored the Mode 7, that's all you did was you spun the screen, so you can't really pick up your TV and turn it, so you know, you use the L and R buttons on the Super Nintendo controller.
340406	341786	That's what you do on LocoRoco.
341986	342386	That's cool.
342866	345327	But it's funny, I was looking at the screen, I was like, LocoRoco.
347207	355969	And it's, yeah, it's all super Japanese, everything is in Japanese, so, but it's like really easy Japanese, so it's not like that hard to read it.
356317	359299	Everything's written in Katakana, so it's super easy.
360319	363081	Unless you're like me and you don't understand a lick of Japanese no matter what.
363141	365682	Katakana, Hiragana, I don't want to... You know the difference.
367103	374107	I know there's two, but that's just because after doing this show for four years and listening to you bitch about enough Japanese games, I picked up that.
374887	375708	My job is done.
376168	376488	All right.
376948	378309	Loki, how was your gaming week?
379150	379930	It was pretty good.
381471	382071	What did I play?
382291	384573	I played a lot of Jewel Quest and...
386277	394840	I actually beat the game finally, but except the thing is you have to play through like six different difficulties, which is kind of lame, but I don't know.
395701	398042	And then a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers.
398162	403544	I was going to be playing Point Blank DS, but a certain GameStop didn't have it in.
404284	405805	Looked at me crazy when asked for it.
406165	407585	Point Blank got a DS?
407685	408706	Who'd want that game?
409846	410766	That sounds cool.
411387	411967	It is cool.
412495	414218	But they're not cool.
415340	419065	Remember how you were talking about before in the distributor world how certain titles are broken down?
419086	421349	Like you have your AA titles and your A titles.
421369	425155	Like a AA title would be like, what, Grand Theft Auto or something really big, Halo.
425215	427579	And then like your A titles, which are kind of big.
428004	429405	and then like B title, C title.
429565	432588	What, is Point Blank like an E title or something, apparently?
432788	434069	I have it as a AAA title.
434129	439193	It's a long-running franchise and it would have been perfect for the DS, but apparently GameStop doesn't think that way.
439313	444157	GameStop's more concerned of Urban Chaos or Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.
444477	449601	Yeah, I can't play them on a DS, dumbass, and it's probably the only solid DS title coming out this week.
450282	455466	But no, they're more concerned with, you know, ripping me off on turning in my DVDs now.
456650	466613	by the way, they mostly, all their DVDs, they magically don't have in their system, therefore they have to give you the generic price, which is 75 cents, to which I told them to fuck off.
468154	477777	Actually, DVDs don't really sell, so that's... I know, our company buys them back from... Take them to a video clearance center or whatever.
478277	478577	I know.
478757	479697	Sorry, that's local.
479757	480658	It's so far away.
482218	482938	So yeah, they sucked.
483879	484219	No, they don't.
484439	485039	They pay my bills.
487770	488191	No, they don't.
488371	489071	They pay my bills.
489671	492112	They may pay your bills, but they don't carry point blank.
492152	493672	Children, games.
494953	497254	Well, I'm not driving all the way over there.
497694	499434	Loki, games.
501035	502375	I played through Blazing Angels.
502415	505336	I'm trying to beat the game so I can sell it back because it sucks.
506037	515480	I don't know what they were trying to do with the art style in the game, but it's really annoying because when you're flying, there's this big dark black crap on the outside of the screen that's
516482	517603	I don't know what it's supposed to look like.
517923	520124	Is it because I'm blacking out because I'm flying?
520264	522125	Or is it supposed to be... What?
522225	526427	But when I'm shooting at something, everything else gets dark on the outside and bright in the middle.
526668	529329	It's like I have a TV with bad contrast or something.
529689	531110	And it just can't fix itself.
531450	532831	That's what the whole game plays like.
534252	535232	So I don't get that.
535893	537553	The game is kind of retarded.
538394	541115	But hopefully, least achievements, there's only seven of them.
541856	544357	And it's pretty easy.
544377	545858	It's just like beating the game a couple times.
546432	550053	I got it for free, okay?
550113	552553	So I'm going to sell it back after we get all the achievements.
553433	555434	So is that the only reason it sucks, the graphics?
555634	556934	Or is it just not a fun game, or what?
557014	560695	The graphics and the fact that the camera is really annoying.
560915	567436	And the camera, a lot of times, you can lock on different planes to see where they are, so you can select a target.
568136	571657	The only problem is, though, there's so many planes flying around, it's hard to target anything.
571977	573357	And half the time, it targets the wrong thing.
573437	574718	It's just like Grand Theft Auto.
574738	575858	It targets the wrong...
576445	576785	Objects.
576905	578767	So, that's kind of annoying.
579788	582149	So, the camera, the graphics are really annoying.
582730	583831	Otherwise, it's okay.
584051	586653	I was playing some multiplayer on it, and that's kind of fun.
587173	589655	I think that's probably the only reason you'd want to get it, is just multiplayer.
591116	595179	But, to be honest, I'd be willing to see what Over G Fighters looks like.
596280	599963	That would probably be a better buy versus Blades of Angels, but I don't know.
600203	601204	It's an easy game, I guess.
602705	604186	So, that's pretty much all I played this week.
604892	616604	That and Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories Still Gonna be playing that game until the next one comes out Alright And each week we find more and more wrong with the multiplayer Which we'll get into later Alright
617548	618809	My Gaming Week, let's see.
620169	622550	Oh, actually, I want to go chat real quick before we go to My Gaming Week.
622730	629733	I wanted to point out Ari Mawson is talking about the LocoRoco English demo, which apparently is available at psp.playstation.com.
629773	634194	You can browse there on your PSP, and you can get the demo for the English version of LocoRoco.
634274	637495	Yeah, we couldn't get that to work, so we just got the Japanese one off the website.
637816	639976	But that's good news for people like me if I can get it to work.
640357	642978	So who doesn't understand, remember, a lick of Japanese.
643818	644158	Let's see.
644758	646919	There are detailed instructions for downloading on my LiveJournal.
648459	653363	Yeah, but not everybody that listens to the show can read your LiveJournal, so... Nope, not everybody is that privileged.
653503	653783	All right.
653903	655264	We do have a LiveJournal community, though.
655304	657526	It's a username, OrangeLounge, if you are a LiveJournal member.
657866	661589	And maybe if you ask really nicely on that community, Jamie will cross-post her instructions.
662250	662770	That would be cool.
664091	664472	All right.
665172	668615	Ari Mawson also wants to point out he 100%ed LocoRoco in nine minutes.
668675	669596	Well, you big stud.
669636	669976	Go you.
670937	671217	All right.
671257	672198	Anyway, MyGamingWeek.
673539	677182	I also played Oidan, the DS dance...
678541	693978	I don't know, it's going to be elite beat agents here in the US And it's going to be a completely different game Yeah, because it's very Japanese They're completely redoing the whole story, redoing the characters in it There's like these guys in suits and not the male cheer squad
695539	698561	They're going to have to because it's all the text, all the music.
698581	700182	It's not that they have to, it's that they are.
700562	701663	Everything is being changed.
701783	711429	I mean, I was saying like, because they're going to have to, if they had to translate it all anyway, I mean, they're going to have to build it from the ground up practically because it's so very, you know, Japanese.
711449	714231	It's like you've got the Office Lady stage and you have the...
715029	720753	It's actually pretty much considered a sequel, just released out over here.
720973	721314	Interesting.
723295	732061	I have only really seen the game, I think I saw it for two minutes at E3, so I didn't really get a chance to really figure out what it's all about, but it's actually kind of fun.
732081	742949	For those who haven't played it, it's a music game, and it plays music in the background, and you tap on the DS screen certain places, sort of in beat with the music, depending on what the lyrics are, but sometimes you trace.
743709	744630	Almost like in Guitar Man.
744990	748733	Have you played the one song, there was one song where you draw a heart, you trace a heart?
748893	749834	It's so cute because it's like a love song.
749854	750934	I only played up to the second stage.
752335	754917	Listening to two musics going on at the same time just gave me a headache.
755017	762363	I was playing on Miklatov's DS and he has them all unlocked because he's been playing that game like crazy and he told me to play this stage because there was a heart that you draw at the end.
762383	763343	I thought that was really cute.
764204	766005	It's a very simple game but it's hard.
766105	766606	It's a heart.
766686	768227	It judges very harshly.
768247	770989	You have to be good or it's going to penalize you big time.
771451	772853	So it was a lot of fun.
772873	776638	I'm actually thinking about importing it if it is going to be a whole lot different from the English one.
776758	777799	It would make it worth it.
778660	779141	So we'll see.
779730	780570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
802725	803546	They're a lot nicer.
803566	806147	They're a lot brighter, a lot crisper, a lot cleaner.
807128	809870	And the stylus, I noticed, was a lot thicker.
810310	812032	It was a lot more kind of sturdy.
812072	815174	I mean, I'm sure you're going to lose it just as easy, but it fit a lot better in the hand.
816895	822319	The only complaint I have about it is the sound isn't as powerful, and that's probably because of the fact that you're putting it in a smaller box.
822719	825901	It's not capable of producing quite the large volume with no headphones.
826822	828943	But otherwise, it's a great system.
830120	836565	But I'm not going to buy one right now because I'm not going to be a sucker to Nintendo's... They always do this.
836985	839967	They'll put out new colors and then I say, oh, I want one of the new colors.
840007	842209	I'm holding out for the new colors is what I'm doing.
842809	845211	So maybe I'll get a DS Lite at that point.
845231	846772	But for now, I'll stick with my DS Fat.
846892	847432	Thank you very much.
848053	851856	And then also my gaming week has been a hell of a lot of World of Warcraft.
852116	854577	Just playing the crap out of World of Warcraft.
854918	857960	They actually launched a bunch of new servers on Saturday and
858991	884786	and I kind of like starting on a new server because I don't know there's something kind of fun about the fact that there's no uber powerful people and even though the noob areas are really crowded you know everybody's trying to work together for a common goal and it's really easy to find parties for some of the noob quests because everybody's trying to be like the first to be level 60 so that was kind of fun and I played hardcore I mean that server went up I think Saturday at noon or maybe it was Friday at noon I'm not sure
885757	907778	and I'm already level 13 which I'm sure some people are like oh that's nothing I can get from 0 to 10 in an hour but you know I'm not a hardcore World of Warcraft player so for me getting to level 13 in the course of a weekend took a lot of playing so I'm quite proud of that accomplishment and saddened at the same time but I'm having fun on the new server I'm playing a mage and mages are a heck of a lot of fun
908632	910113	Tweek thinks the DS Lite is too small
928777	930078	Tweek says the DS Lite is too small.
930418	938043	It is, you know, it feels a little different in the hands, but I was reading complaints online about the DS Lite kind of felt different.
938063	939523	It didn't feel right because it was too small.
939824	940484	I didn't notice it.
940524	943366	It felt fine to me, but maybe I'm just crazy.
943406	943706	I don't know.
946608	955573	Anushi's saying that I went through about two black ones until I found out about the white PSP, so kind of going back to the whole colors and releasing new systems and all that stuff.
956433	957434	All right, anyway.
959064	960125	Gaming News for the Week
981360	982640	Thanks for watching!
1000970	1001931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1025478	1026800	Anyways, it continues on.
1026820	1028261	No, actually, this doesn't do anything.
1028381	1028822	All this does is...
1045475	1052139	Do what people are doing already, and the parents are going to buy their games for them, and then they're going to go, I didn't know!
1052419	1057321	I didn't know that on the back of the box when it said violent content, then there's violent content in the game!
1057341	1060023	I just thought they'd seen those words on there!
1060583	1062904	It's retarded!
1062945	1063525	Most of the time...
1064676	1070440	No matter how many laws and how easily explained this to parents, they don't care.
1070900	1080807	They're just gonna give it to their children to get little Billy to stop whining, and then when little Billy goes and murders their neighbor, then they'll go, Oh my god, the games are horrible!
1081267	1092895	It's not because I didn't watch them and bought him a gun or anything, it's just because the games are... It's just people need to take responsibility for their children, and the
1093823	1095404	The government thinks that they can help us out.
1095484	1099185	Well, you know, I think they should pass breeding laws instead.
1100585	1102386	So the stupid people stop having children.
1103146	1104007	Standardized testing.
1106528	1108028	So, that's basically what's going on.
1108088	1112730	Of course, I'm sure we'll hear more about how the ESA is going to be suing them.
1113250	1118452	And so far, in the last five lawsuits or whatever, they've been deemed unconstitutional.
1118632	1121873	So, you know, it's because they get those laws, you know,
1123915	1126980	That harmful of minors, well, that's subjective, so you know what?
1128562	1130244	Who says what's harmful?
1131626	1135992	And they haven't really proven that games are harmful of minors, so I don't know.
1137645	1138586	I just have to comment here.
1138626	1142449	I love that the chat isn't saying a damn thing about the article at all.
1142770	1145432	Instead, these are the type of comments we're getting in the chat room right now.
1146313	1146693	Let's see.
1146913	1149836	YouWillBowToMe says, Loki's girl voice makes me laugh.
1149936	1151938	To which the best says, is Loki a girl?
1152578	1155341	And WonderDogHerald says, I love Loki's femme parent voice.
1155421	1158083	And Bandit says, let's pitch in to get him a training bra.
1162727	1163768	I'm glad they're listening.
1164344	1168027	I know, I'm glad they hear the message in this about this horrible, ignorant law.
1168047	1172111	Because I think a lot of parents are like this, you know, they're all, mmm, M rating, ooh, shiny!
1172271	1173993	And then, you know, just let their kids buy it.
1174073	1175915	I mean, that's what it comes down to.
1176495	1180779	Now, again, not all parents, because we have intelligent parents that listen to this program.
1180799	1182501	Yes, there are intelligent parents out there.
1182941	1188526	By the way, Happy Father's Day to the gamer dads listening tonight.
1189227	1189787	Forgot to mention.
1189947	1190648	I didn't call mine.
1192236	1192596	Playing hockey.
1192616	1192937	Playing hockey.
1213929	1216550	Jaded 2006 I think hit the nail on the head here.
1216690	1218711	It's been repeating over and over again.
1218751	1221632	I think that's why the chat room is stopping to really refrain comment.
1221652	1224993	I mean, how many times have we heard this type of story but in different states?
1225273	1227794	Where it's just, you know, let's blame the games.
1228834	1234176	Let's put this law with vague, vague, vague language as to what a violent video game really is.
1234796	1236577	And, you know, blame it on them.
1237497	1240778	Meanwhile, you know, I just saw The Omen after last...
1241397	1242397	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1256299	1257559	All the fundamentalists.
1281785	1282326	I don't know.
1282346	1285109	To which we get the chat comment, Xander K says, Loki is a hooker.
1306598	1309399	GamePolitics.com Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineau He Who Shall Not Be Named
1327646	1328667	and it went into law.
1328687	1329588	This is the funny thing.
1329648	1331449	It went into law immediately.
1331609	1334431	There was no January 1st date, November 1st, whatever date.
1334471	1336172	It went into law ASAP.
1336512	1348079	By the way, on a side note, big congratulations to GamePolitics.com because they're getting a mention in Entertainment Weekly this week about like, it's in the section like 100 websites you should be visiting or something like that and they're in there.
1348599	1350841	And I agree, it is a website you should visit if you're a gamer.
1351081	1355924	I just find it funny, you know, Louisiana is just rampant with, you know,
1356784	1363487	basically bad political decisions where it was, you know, moving the money for levy repair to other things.
1364388	1368129	But we shall not comment on Louisiana's intelligence in the political world.
1369750	1370951	So, wow.
1372031	1372751	Don't know what else to say.
1372771	1379755	I mean, that's not really a big surprise, but it did happen and it is law in Louisiana right now, so... Thank God I don't live in the South anymore.
1379795	1380255	I'm sorry.
1381075	1383616	I mean, I feel... I liked growing up there, you know?
1384677	1384817	But...
1385208	1388691	I'm glad I got away from a lot of the backwards thought that goes on there.
1390052	1390613	Alrighty.
1390973	1394116	Speaking of backwards thought... Oh yeah, Jacky Poo.
1394336	1396518	Yes, you have an article on He Who Shall Not Be Named.
1396678	1397638	On Mr. Jackass.
1398779	1399940	That's what I'm going to call him from now on.
1399960	1401141	Either Jacky Poo or Jackass.
1401362	1401542	Right.
1402222	1403864	So, yeah.
1404324	1407307	Do you know that actually Jack Thompson is right on a few things?
1408307	1408588	You know?
1408788	1409068	What?
1409468	1412391	Entertainment... There's a list up here, actually.
1414188	1415149	Pointless Waste of Time
1430839	1433701	I think that they're, well, I look at it this way.
1433841	1437123	He's been twisting reality to suit his own purposes.
1437424	1443968	Well, we can completely just, you know, show where he is indeed right, but also show where he is wrong in his correctness.
1444288	1444729	Interesting.
1444989	1449172	Correctness would have been in quote fingers, by the way, except this is radio, so you can't see me being awesome.
1449972	1451573	So, what?
1452054	1452394	A thing.
1452414	1452594	Okay.
1453580	1456022	Yes, entertainment can change your personality.
1458284	1460185	I love how it's listed here.
1460225	1465870	Have you ever gotten sad at a movie or listened to a song that evoked a certain emotional response?
1467451	1470173	Have you been completely unmoved by any form of art?
1472028	1475691	I would think, like, have you ever seen a movie that you might think changed your life in one way or another?
1476091	1477332	Or maybe changed your outlook?
1477512	1483215	There's even a point here where they're saying, you know, actors and actresses saying, you know, that they want their movie to raise awareness on an issue.
1484036	1487658	Well, you know, so yeah, in that case, he is right.
1487738	1498544	It can affect, you know, but then again, you know, video games are no different than a movie, than looking at a painting, than looking, than reading a book.
1499345	1501046	I mean, there's a book at Walmart called Naked Murder.
1502933	1504194	At Walmart?
1504594	1506315	No one's crying about that.
1507135	1509117	Heaven forbid.
1511238	1514660	What about watching Hamlet?
1515200	1516801	How much murder is in freaking Hamlet?
1516841	1518622	How much incest is in Hamlet?
1519442	1522164	So yeah, that's completely refuted.
1522631	1523931	Okay, another point.
1524191	1525832	Cops have a right to complain.
1525892	1526412	Well, that's true.
1526452	1532873	If you're playing a game where someone's going around killing cops, if I were a police officer, that would make me a little, uh, I'd do that.
1533254	1534814	It's like the anti-lawyer killing game.
1534854	1540955	A lawyer would go, uh, or if it's like someone goes into a call center and kills everybody, I'd be like, stay away from my cubicle.
1541716	1546257	You know, so on that point of view, yeah, they have a right to be upset.
1546397	1551358	You know, wouldn't you be if someone were going around, you know, hacking off, you know, people who do what you do?
1554673	1557575	Sorry, just different songs from my childhood popped into my head suddenly.
1557695	1559516	Can I interject a little chat room humor in here?
1559636	1560196	Sure.
1560316	1568401	Fireboma says, in response to, you know, emotional response to art, Fireboma says, you mean how, like, certain music makes cowards cut themselves?
1569201	1569381	Yeah.
1569821	1570062	Emo.
1570722	1570842	Yeah.
1571562	1578646	So, now this is where he's wrong, is that, I mean, basically...
1580663	1583304	There's not too many games out there that really point that out.
1583464	1589047	I mean, you can, your games have a point.
1589587	1591548	You're supposed to accomplish certain goals in it.
1592409	1601393	You know, like the sites putting out in Grand Theft Auto, you have a choice to either go out and commit all these crimes, or you can go through the game without doing any of that.
1602173	1605455	It's not probably as much fun, but you do have the option of not doing it.
1607452	1608934	I gotta play Devil's Advocate here for a minute.
1608974	1617243	What about a game like, because I just was playing this earlier today, Burnout, where I'm encouraged to slam into other cars and I get more points when I do so, and that's really the only way to win the game.
1617303	1619386	Are you going to go out on the road and slam your car?
1619506	1620907	No, because I'm not a fucking idiot.
1621288	1622249	Okay, point taken.
1623693	1625014	It's still a choice, right?
1625294	1625695	I guess.
1625955	1627776	In that one, you're forced into that circumstance.
1627836	1630038	But in real life, you're not forced into doing anything.
1630138	1638243	If I wanted to drive my car through rush hour traffic the wrong way and slam into everybody I could, I wouldn't need a video game to probably make me do that.
1638884	1640685	Something's wrong with me anyway.
1640925	1642266	You'd need another X chromosome.
1645669	1650372	Another point was that games appeal to the worst in us moving on.
1652081	1653802	Well, more specifically, Teenage Boys.
1654082	1661809	But, you know, yeah, they make profit from Dead or Alive and from other games that are going to appeal to your average young man, you know.
1662589	1664891	But this is my favorite, favorite point.
1665332	1668054	This is where he's wrong, and it's the chart from the U.S.
1668094	1671397	Department of Justice showing crimes going down since the early 90s.
1672117	1674199	In fact, it's quite a significant plummet.
1674239	1675380	In fact, I'm going to...
1676368	1681651	Link the image to the chat room so they can look at this because I think that this is pretty awesome.
1683052	1688516	It's basically showing how, I mean, and it's a pretty severe drop.
1688556	1689196	It's crazy.
1689697	1695120	If you look at it, it's gone from over, from the, you know, 40, 50 million range.
1695340	1699643	I'm sorry, sorry, 50,000 range to dropping down under the 20s.
1701304	1705907	So yeah, Jack needs to get his head out of his ass and live in the real world with the rest of us.
1706667	1708707	Not every game also has a message to it.
1708747	1715469	I mean, Pac-Man isn't like a demonstration of drug abuse or anything like that.
1715589	1717209	It's just a game.
1717249	1718790	You do stuff.
1718870	1719370	That's it.
1719450	1725892	I mean, Grand Theft Auto isn't a game about murdering people to teach you about how to go out and be a successful killer.
1726072	1727832	It's a game with a story.
1728112	1728752	That's it.
1729412	1731693	I mean, sometimes games are just simple like that.
1731773	1734534	Stop trying to read way too into things.
1735034	1736314	That's why I think a lot of people have
1736650	1737891	Thanks for watching!
1767043	1767503	The Holodeck
1789309	1790029	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1819031	1830742	Well, tell me, do you learn how to clean your gun, how to aim, how to fire, how to pull the trigger, proper gun maintenance, how to actually hold the weapon?
1831123	1833205	Do first-person shooters actually teach you how to do that?
1833425	1837089	They will when NRA The Game comes out in August.
1837549	1839411	I could learn all that from a Civil War reenactment.
1840472	1843435	You can go to a freaking firing range.
1844418	1845159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1861938	1869966	There was that kid who said that Grand Theft Auto 3 made him kill people in one case, I think, in Japan where they were saying it.
1870467	1871588	This is the point that I like.
1871668	1874792	What about all of the murders that happened before the game came out?
1874872	1875713	Did it make them do that too?
1877067	1877767	I think this is great.
1877908	1878148	Okay.
1878488	1883550	They're saying with GTA 3, they showed 7 million copies worldwide and say that another million were pirated.
1883570	1885271	I'm just quoting off the site here.
1885851	1894374	So that means that when you have all of those cases, the number of murders actually blamed on Grand Theft Auto 3 out of 4 million users, that would be .00003%.
1894414	1894474	Hmm.
1899708	1900569	Where's this article again?
1900669	1905692	It's at pointlesswastetoftime.com slash games slash censorship dot html.
1905832	1906112	Read it.
1906172	1906732	Definitely read it.
1906772	1909994	This is like one of the single best articles I've seen in a long time.
1910413	1911293	All right, awesome.
1912134	1914835	Loki, we're going to go over to Loki, who has some news about a game.
1916576	1918176	There can't be anything wrong with this game.
1918277	1924879	Even the fundamentalist, the most crazy people, I don't think could find anything wrong with this game.
1924919	1925320	Right, Loki?
1925740	1930042	I dropped a crate on somebody, and Luminous made me do it, and I killed somebody.
1930062	1930402	My bad.
1930822	1931642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1953630	1953930	Warpy!
1953970	1954311	Warpy!
1983700	1984240	for the game.
1986763	1987984	You have got to be kidding me.
1988024	1988644	No, I'm not.
1988985	1989865	Where is this article?
1990306	1992507	This is on GameInformer.com.
1993288	1994169	That bastard.
1995216	1996997	So, um, isn't that wonderful?
1997037	1998097	But, um, you know what?
1998397	2003139	A big hearty fuck you to these people, because seriously, do not, this is what they're, they're crack dealers.
2003319	2003939	This is what they're doing.
2004419	2014463	They get, they put out the first game for a low price on the PSP, and, you know, now that we're all addicted, they're, we want more smack, they're gonna start charging us out the ass for it.
2014483	2016703	And I bet you multiplayer's not the only thing they're gonna charge for.
2016923	2021265	They're gonna charge for each additional song, you want any of the cool licensed songs, you're gonna have to pay for it.
2022162	2023423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2046161	2046861	Yeah, exactly.
2047781	2053403	And they're saying, though, that they're going to be probably having some exclusive music for different regions and whatnot.
2054043	2062885	But I just... When I saw that, though, about the multiplayer thing, that was really kind of disappointing, you know?
2063845	2065526	So, I don't know.
2067506	2070887	I have to go to chat room because they're being really funny right now.
2070967	2073608	And our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf's in there, and he's saying...
2074349	2079954	Did you hear the story, and it's not in our show world for tonight, but maybe you guys heard about all the DS lights that got stolen in Hong Kong.
2080594	2086319	He says, well, Luminous, the crate stealers were influenced by Luminous, so ban Luminous in Hong Kong.
2086899	2087240	That's it.
2088261	2090282	So here's exactly where it says right there.
2090542	2095306	Will you be able to, this is the question, Game Informer, will you be able to play Luminous live against other people online?
2095707	2098249	Currently, we are currently working on a versus mode.
2098289	2101091	Puzzle mode will be two players online.
2101131	2103293	Okay, so you can play two players, I guess.
2104557	2112121	If you do purchase a Versus mode, every mode will have a price, but they won't be high priced.
2112201	2119865	First, you purchase the basic package of Luminous Live, and then you add Versus mode to it.
2120405	2123926	At least that's the way we have it planned right now.
2123986	2128569	We're still trying to determine if we'll package Versus in with the basic package.
2128809	2131350	Yeah, you better, because that's really stupid if you don't.
2136038	2136978	DarkSakura DarkSakura
2160187	2164749	Basically, you know how in Japan you have vending machines for everything, right?
2165309	2171311	From beer vending machines to used panty vending machines to Sony's vending machines.
2172232	2172912	Well, guess what?
2173092	2176553	They're experimenting with the vending machines outside of Japan.
2177394	2183776	Apparently, they've got test vending machines out now on a limited run.
2185115	2188557	And they're going to be actually adding about seven more U.S.
2188617	2192040	locations at airports and various places.
2192140	2195302	But they're also considering opening some of these up in the U.K.
2195362	2195602	too.
2196683	2203028	So, I mean, basically, the cards are supposed to be, they use debit and credit cards.
2203568	2206371	So you put it in, pick what you want, pull it out, and it charges your card.
2207411	2209553	So what am I going to be able to buy on these machines, like PSPs?
2211221	2215122	You can get PSPs, digital cameras, CD players, games, DVDs.
2216163	2218083	Basically, they're calling them robotic stores.
2218283	2218783	UMDs?
2219204	2223005	Maybe this is Sony's way to finally breathe some life in UMDs.
2223025	2223685	No, they've got these.
2223785	2228707	They're starting to put them in train stations, and they're actually... We sell to them our distribution company.
2228747	2230267	There's an iPod vending machine in the Metreon.
2230307	2231007	Why not Sony one?
2231067	2233648	I was going to say, that's probably where Sony got the idea from.
2233688	2235469	Well, I mean... Oh, they've already had it in Japan for a while.
2235489	2235709	I'm sorry.
2235729	2235949	I'm sorry.
2236409	2242291	Where Sony saw that it could be successful is because Apple's having big success with their iPod vending machines.
2242311	2249753	And when I first heard about that, I think it was actually when your buddy Tiara in Vegas was talking about there was an iPod vending machine at the Hilton there or something.
2250313	2251753	And I was like, really?
2251953	2255314	I put a dollar for candy.
2255374	2257295	I can't imagine putting $100 in a vending machine.
2257315	2260036	Here's the only thing I have a problem with.
2261378	2265501	I hate when you put a dollar in the vending machine and your chips get stuck.
2265821	2270104	What's going to happen if I pay for a PSP and the fucking PSP gets lodged in there?
2270765	2272746	I'm going to be pissed.
2272846	2274367	I think they'd be like a robotic arm.
2275048	2279991	Because they wouldn't want to drop expensive machinery down a little hole.
2280051	2282533	There's got to be a weight trigger or something.
2282553	2285215	Because even the fancy food vending machines now have a weight trigger.
2286035	2288577	So when the food hits the bottom, it knows that something hit it.
2289520	2294284	But so far, the testing locations are in California, Georgia, and Colorado.
2294985	2302331	And I actually, I think that you can, on Sony's site, I think they might have a location listing, but I haven't had an opportunity to check that yet.
2302852	2305354	But I'm sure you can find something on Sony's website.
2306255	2309298	Probably going to be like LA, Atlanta, Denver.
2309318	2309678	Denver.
2311499	2315781	And if you want to submit a picture of yourself kicking a Sony vending machine, we'll put it in our orange laundry.
2315981	2316901	Not that we endorse it.
2317001	2317141	No.
2317421	2318322	Don't actually kick it.
2318342	2320422	Or, you know, make an obscene gesture toward it.
2320482	2321483	Don't actually kick it.
2321503	2324744	But if you want to take a picture of your foot up next to it, you know, like you're going to kick it.
2324764	2325724	Like we've had kick an Ultra K, remember?
2325744	2327345	Yeah, because we had kick the Ultra K a while back.
2327385	2329025	So now we'll do kick the Sony vending machine.
2329466	2330026	I'll tell you what.
2330186	2330606	I'll tell you what.
2330946	2333247	The top photo will win something.
2333925	2337226	The Sony vending machine actually isn't a vending machine.
2337266	2340748	It's actually the PlayStation 3 case.
2341328	2342068	Alright, alright.
2342188	2343689	Let's keep it moving.
2345650	2349211	Also, speaking of the PlayStation 3, there was a pretty...
2349887	2367297	Funny observation made this week on the PlayStation 3, and it kind of dates back to E3, but somebody was going through their E3 pictures, looking at the pictures of the Sony controller for the PlayStation 3, and looked really closely and saw that something was wrong with the select button on the controller, on the prototype there.
2367817	2371359	It didn't say select, and this is the controller that was in the glass case next to the PlayStation 3.
2371899	2374581	It didn't say select, it said surrect.
2375599	2377541	S-E-R-E-C-T S-E-R-E-C-T
2403188	2403908	A blatant error.
2403948	2404209	I don't know.
2404489	2406070	Has anybody asked Sony directly about this?
2409391	2409692	Who knows?
2411233	2411713	That's silly.
2411793	2414274	Anyway, Loki, how about the Wii controller?
2414835	2420878	The Wii controller, according to Miyamoto, not going to have a microphone.
2422182	2428285	He says it would increase the price of the console too much to justify the inclusion of a microphone.
2428685	2432907	I call bullshit though, because I mean, come on, a microphone that small can't cost anything.
2432947	2435008	I mean, it's going to be like a buck or two.
2435028	2438290	I mean, really, it's going to cost that much more.
2438720	2444104	And even still, if they want to say that they're not going to put one on there, there is a little fucking connection in the back.
2444144	2445825	You can pop in a microphone right there.
2445965	2451690	So I'm still saying... Why doesn't Nintendo just do the Nintendo thing and add it later?
2451810	2453771	They have a microphone in the DS.
2454031	2454272	It ain't...
2455132	2456133	and DarkSakura.com.
2474960	2480663	because that's going to say that you need to have a DS in order to play certain games, and they're not going to do that.
2481323	2488487	And you could do that for some games, I imagine, but I would say why not just... They could easily add a microphone to this.
2488747	2495451	Maybe it's a space issue, because the controller is pretty small, but microphones nowadays...
2497018	2525702	small electronic devices they're damn tiny and I know they can't be too expensive like a buck or two really and that's you know going and buying the parts at Radio Shack let alone what they get you know at cost so who knows you will bow to me in our chat room says they need a mic that registers blue without saying brew if you've played that's voice recognition software that has nothing to do with you know whatever all right
2528771	2537199	I just might.
2537339	2544385	In fact, you know, I think that we're not the only ones frustrated with the PS3, you know?
2544545	2547768	I think a lot of developers are pretty pissed off about it, too.
2549429	2553913	Actually, a lot of developers are leaving the PS3 to start develop on the Wii, and LucasArts is one of them.
2555220	2572698	Um, there are, uh, actually some rumors that actually they were printed in the last, uh, EGM are saying that, uh, you know, so far they're still in the rumor phase, but it seems a lot of the third party developers are kind of pissed off at Sony and, uh, have gone over to a system that they're going to be able to sell more games on.
2573599	2576562	Um, the games are going to cost more to develop for the PlayStation three.
2576662	2578304	It's not viable for them to do business on.
2578846	2586668	So a lot of areas are looking to move over, and they're saying that now LucasArts is one of them who's working on a Star Wars game for the Wii.
2587888	2593409	They want to take advantage of the controller and the sound, the speaker in the controller.
2594309	2596610	So basically, think of a lightsaber game.
2597350	2602131	If that pans out the way it describes there, that's going to be bad news for Sony.
2603911	2604931	Sony shot themselves.
2604971	2605891	I don't feel sorry for them at all.
2606011	2607492	Well, maybe they can win them back.
2607632	2608492	What can they do to win them back?
2609339	2610240	More first party games.
2611401	2613943	How about, you know, make a system that isn't complete ass.
2614003	2615665	Focus on the games, not what they look like.
2616105	2618447	More twisted metal, more violent twisted metal.
2619088	2620029	That would be the way to do it.
2620889	2622411	Guns, violence, hookers, Loki.
2622671	2624192	Lots of gun violent hooker games.
2624512	2627475	And maybe, I don't know, put out Gran Turismo that's not a port of an older one.
2628236	2629156	That might be a good start.
2629797	2630057	Alright.
2630938	2636623	Going back over to the Wii for a minute, you know, I gotta say lots of cool points.
2637259	2637919	on Nintendo.
2637959	2640620	And this is just one more kind of to add to that.
2641441	2650844	Nintendo is showing controllers for the Wii behind closed doors that resemble pads from the TurboGrafx-16, the Genesis, the NES.
2651245	2651625	Get this.
2651905	2657207	They're saying that you can actually plug these into your Wii controller and use these for the virtual console.
2658147	2662229	Now, the problem is this story is a little bit different the several times I've read about it this week.
2662589	2670837	Somebody on our forums actually posted a picture of all these things in a briefcase saying that you would be able to plug in your old controller.
2670877	2675121	So if you have old Super Nintendo controllers sitting around the house just gathering dust, you could plug these in.
2675141	2675741	There's going to be an adapter.
2675761	2678384	You can plug it into the Wii controller and use them on the virtual console.
2679105	2684006	But now other stories I'm reading say that, no, they're making new ones that resemble the old controllers.
2684046	2685847	So we kind of have a little bit of a disconnect there.
2685907	2687827	So this could all just be a bunch of crap.
2687847	2690408	Well, third party can always come out and create something like that.
2690448	2690948	Exactly.
2691028	2692868	See, third party would probably create it anyway.
2693188	2698710	But if Nintendo's doing this themselves, I love the adapter idea for virtual console.
2699010	2703911	But then you kind of think about, okay, well, would I be able to use like a Super Nintendo controller on the NES games?
2704431	2705611	Well, why not, I guess.
2705711	2707812	But, you know, Nintendo's going to have to kind of think all that out.
2708123	2712345	and how weird is that going to be to use a Sega Genesis controller to play a Nintendo game?
2712705	2713566	How weird is that going to be?
2714186	2714466	I don't know.
2717768	2718468	I think it's kind of weird.
2721890	2727273	DarkSakura going into a virtual gaming system of a different type.
2728753	2731054	Well, guess what has finally happened?
2731575	2731875	What's that?
2732215	2736017	We have seen Geometry Wars defeated by UNO.
2736874	2738275	Wait, wait, wait.
2738576	2740698	Like, people playing it, or what?
2741619	2748946	The Xbox 360 version of Uno is the highest daily demo-to-sale conversion of any Xbox Live Arcade game.
2749446	2749627	Wow.
2749707	2752309	It even topped Geometry Wars Retro Evolved.
2753310	2753711	Wow.
2753771	2755292	Yep.
2755573	2756814	It's, like, not just that.
2756854	2758435	Apparently, it's given it the SmackDown...
2759835	2765079	Basically, it's about $0.40 to $0.55 profit, I think, more per sale.
2765099	2766540	Let me look a little bit further.
2767361	2769282	But basically, they're sort of using that now.
2769362	2772324	They could make other card games and see if that tops.
2772625	2773165	Oh, goody.
2773225	2776027	Now we're going to get a sea of card games that are only going to be mediocre.
2776087	2777428	Texas Hold'em is coming in July.
2777728	2779530	You know people will be playing that.
2779930	2780891	There are a lot of poker fiends.
2781031	2781651	I won't be one of them.
2782332	2784033	I think the poker thing is kind of a little overrated.
2785233	2786494	But you know what's even going to be worse?
2787415	2790778	When the Xbox Live Vision comes out.
2792259	2794841	There is going to be so much...
2797421	2798082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2821938	2825740	Of course, any story on Xbox Live brings the mandatory comment here.
2825820	2828161	DigiNova says, I want Street Fighter on Live.
2828201	2828881	When will it come?
2829201	2831842	Did you like Microsoft's little cock tease this week?
2832162	2835724	They put up Street Fighter 2 themes and pictures, user pictures.
2836424	2836944	No game.
2837564	2846048	So when you go into the Xbox Live and you go in to download new stuff, Street Fighter 2 comes up and you go like, holy shit, finally.
2846068	2851510	And then you go in there and it's themes and gamer pictures for the low, low price of a couple hundred gamer points.
2851886	2855429	And you're like, son of a... Ah, funny.
2857170	2858731	I guess maybe they're just trying to build hype.
2858811	2859131	I don't know.
2859972	2860272	We'll see.
2860312	2861333	It'll be out when it's out.
2861533	2862273	We don't know anymore.
2862313	2863814	We're not going to try and speculate anymore.
2864575	2866777	Capcom can give a date and it'll be wrong.
2868798	2869398	Moving on.
2869518	2872300	Loki, you have a story about Grand Theft Auto 4.
2872881	2874082	Yes, the rumor...
2875063	2878806	The rumor people are saying out there is that it's going to be an MMO.
2879326	2889114	One of the reasons now that they're thinking that is because on the Rockstar Norse site, they're looking for in-game animators, level design motion editors, and network programmers.
2890034	2895418	And so they're thinking, oh, network programmer, that must mean that they're going to make it an MMO.
2895859	2897420	I hope the hell not.
2897560	2899822	Do you know how many people will play as the hooker?
2900783	2901283	Okay, listen.
2901543	2903144	Here's why this will never work.
2903585	2903665	One...
2904525	2908188	Rockstar does not know how to program multiplayer to save their life.
2908388	2910750	It is awful when it comes to Grand Theft Auto.
2929086	2955546	so awful but there's a lot to work on and they definitely need people to be doing that plus I mean if you're going to be doing multiplayer in a game like that it's probably going to be a lot more complex than you know table tennis was I don't think this says anything about it being an MMO and I don't think that they would start off with an MMO I don't know I don't think it's going to happen episodic content yes MMO no I've played table tennis online and it's fine it plays fluid
2956392	2960937	I wish they had the same people working on Liberty City Stories on the PSP.
2960997	2964220	Vice City Stories is goddamn perfect.
2964460	2967623	You think Grand Theft Auto 4 will be multiplayer in some capacity or another?
2968504	2968985	You know what?
2969065	2970146	I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.
2971107	2973949	I wouldn't be surprised if it was live-aware, and that's it.
2975291	2979455	Because, you know, we thought the same thing with Liberty City Stories on the PS2.
2979935	2980656	They tried...
2981298	2983778	and they were unsuccessful to get it working.
2984239	2994780	So what makes you think they're going to be... I mean, maybe Xbox Live might be a little bit easier than PlayStation 3, but I'm not going to be too surprised if it doesn't have multiplayer.
2995561	2999021	I would hope, because that'd be awesome, but I don't think it's going to.
2999101	3000982	Comments on Grand Theft Auto Online.
3001042	3005362	VidPalace says it'll turn into The Sims Online, which you've probably heard us talk about on the show before.
3005702	3008543	Just basically turn into Drugs and Sex, Sims Online.
3009365	3014789	YouWillBowToMe says, I want to play as the guy who works at the chicken joint in a Grand Theft Auto MMO.
3015010	3020374	Well, the multiplayer in the PSP version, I like the modes that they have.
3020434	3021835	If they worked right, it'd be great.
3022115	3028820	Because, you know, eight-man, six-man teams or whatever, that'd be perfect.
3029000	3031062	Just doing a simple deathmatch like any other game.
3031082	3033524	It doesn't have to be a full-blown MMO.
3034244	3037867	Just make the modes work correctly, and then it'll be great.
3038735	3048357	Alright, well, speaking of MMOs, there's been another rumor going around the internet this week about Blizzard MMOs and that Blizzard is going to turn into this MMO-only company.
3048918	3066342	And basically what happened is that F13.net did some type of presentation to Wall Street and a rep from Vivendi said, all Blizzard franchises will become MMOs, to which StarCraft fans and Diablo fans everywhere pooped their pants simultaneously when they heard this.
3067397	3069238	Loki, you think there could be any truth in this?
3069938	3088223	No, because Blizzard actually, when GameSpot questioned them about this whole rumor, they said, Alas, for those yearning for a marathon World of Starcraft session, Blizzard moved quickly the quash rumors of any non-World of Warcraft MMOs.
3089323	3091524	No, that's just a rumor, and
3095454	3103182	We believe that rumor circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of information provided to industry analysts.
3103683	3113393	And if I remember correctly, they had slides that basically showed potential for these games to grow in those areas, not necessarily guaranteeing that they will grow in there.
3116199	3119122	I'm sure I'm going to piss off some Blizzard fans by saying this, but I don't care.
3119222	3123625	But isn't World of Warcraft just Diablo MMO with Warcraft characters?
3123645	3125507	Pretty much, yeah.
3126688	3128169	You already have your Diablo MMO.
3128209	3128849	I don't know what's wrong.
3129149	3129910	StarCraft maybe.
3129990	3134133	I mean, that might be kind of cool, I guess, but it'd be pretty much the same.
3134794	3135634	At least that's what I think.
3136675	3137516	All right, Loki.
3138437	3145222	Now, speaking of MMOs, we see these stories come up once in a while, but they're banning more gold sellers, or what's going on?
3145526	3147988	They've suspended more than 250 accounts.
3149849	3154252	And according to them, they... Wait, is this World of Warcraft or is this something else?
3154292	3155953	This is Final Fantasy XI.
3155993	3167480	They've suspended 250 accounts and have retrieved some $250 billion in gil that's been removed from circulation as response to this.
3167581	3170162	So that's a lot of gil.
3170763	3170903	But...
3172412	3173372	I'm kind of leaning towards a no.
3193902	3194503	I had stuff to do!
3214127	3216849	Now, Final Fantasy XI isn't the only game where this is happening.
3216969	3218690	It is happening in World of Warcraft as well.
3218790	3225174	Blizzard has banned more than 30,000 accounts during May alone for gold farming.
3225214	3225835	Here's a quote.
3226335	3237401	In keeping with Blizzard's aggressive stance against cheating in World of Warcraft, we banned over 30,000 accounts in the month of May, and with that removed over 30 million gold from the economy across all realms.
3237782	3241404	The banned accounts were taking part in activities that violate the game's terms of use...
3242173	3250240	including using third-party programs to farm gold and items, which severely impacts the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.
3250700	3255644	So it looks like there's steps going on in a lot of the big MMOs to boot the gold farmers.
3256064	3268755	Kind of interesting, but what's also interesting about that, let's see, if we take 30 million and divide that by 30,000, that's 1,000 gold a person about that was taken out of the economy, but...
3269656	3269976	I don't know.
3270056	3278563	I know a lot of people who are really, really addicted to World of Warcraft at their level 60s that a thousand gold is attainable for the normal player.
3279003	3281425	You know what's funny about all of this?
3282086	3285869	Everyone's always saying, you know, this gold farming is funny.
3286589	3290152	It hasn't really had any effect on the prices of gold.
3290192	3298979	And I remember every now and then, just out of curiosity, I would go and look over at IGE to see how much they're selling gold for and stuff.
3299728	3303370	And the prices just keep dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping.
3303410	3305671	I'm not sure if that's because they can't sell it anymore.
3306091	3309252	I would think because there's more out there, they would have to drop the prices.
3309333	3313534	Well, what's interesting, too, about World of Warcraft is there's so many realms.
3313795	3315375	There's so many realms now.
3315415	3316116	It's got to be hard.
3316156	3317196	They've added more.
3317216	3319297	Yeah, right, because they've added the new one I just started on.
3319637	3322719	Airy Peak is the one I'm playing on now that just opened up over the weekend.
3322759	3323239	And, you know...
3324483	3324823	DarkSakura.com
3353106	3356270	And DarkSakura, where should all the kids be pointing their browsers this week?
3356710	3358512	This spoke to my special places.
3359934	3363278	It's a site called... I'm sure it did.
3364679	3365200	Well now.
3366431	3370732	No, that's stuck in my head because I've been still going to Weebles every day.
3370872	3373872	Is this show going to need the explicit tag on it?
3374232	3374912	No, no.
3375493	3384354	Okay, last night I was on Weebles stuff watching one of the Weeble and Bob episodes that had that stuck in my head.
3384394	3385534	But anyway, that's not my side of the week.
3385554	3386294	That was an old side of the week.
3386695	3387855	Still awesome site, though.
3388435	3394976	The site of the week this time around is eskadub.uncreativity.com The Catastrophe of Escaflowne.
3396041	3396942	Which is fabulous.
3397402	3403948	But the specific, specific thing on here is if you go under their downloads page, click on Sephiroth's Sexy Choir.
3405570	3406510	You just have to watch it.
3406711	3407571	It's a link to YouTube.
3409213	3411375	It's Sexy Roth.
3412516	3413637	With Aerith's Death of Vision.
3415224	3416505	It's a hilarious video.
3416605	3417305	So well done.
3417505	3419866	And I guess it's... There's a couple cosplayers.
3419886	3421526	It looks like they filmed it in an anime convention.
3421546	3423067	I have no idea where this... There's like a squall cosplayer.
3423087	3424387	Yeah, you can clearly see a squall cosplayer.
3424607	3430529	And they're singing the One Wing Angel, but it's sexy Roth and they... He's got a flat ass.
3430549	3432789	He's got a sexy ass.
3433209	3434510	But the Death of Vision is the best part.
3434570	3435930	The Earth Death of Vision is great.
3436310	3437030	My favorite line.
3437351	3438671	Way to stand there, Cloud.
3440430	3440850	So yeah.
3440870	3450997	Because while the choir is singing, just so you guys know, because this is radio, so it's hard for us to explain, but they've got like this, they play that death scene from Final Fantasy VII over and over again.
3451037	3452298	Well, we want people to go to the site.
3452338	3453219	I don't want to get into copyright things.
3453239	3453539	Go to the site.
3453859	3454019	Yeah.
3454299	3465086	But they play that, they loop that sequence from Final Fantasy VII where Aerith dies over and over again and then like put different filters on it, like black and white and then trippy color and sepia and all this stuff.
3465347	3466007	This is crazy.
3466027	3467188	I love Aerith Death of Vision.
3467508	3468008	That's great.
3468849	3469309	Genius.
3469469	3470070	Pure genius.
3470819	3471739	Congratulations, kids.
3471840	3473240	That's my side of the week.
3473320	3475281	I approve of DarkSakura's side of the week.
3475321	3482605	So again, the site is escadub.uncreativity.com Go click on downloads.
3483125	3483986	You will not regret it.
3484186	3485446	It'll make you fall out of your chair.
3486027	3489809	Do not be drinking Mountain Dew when you watch this, or it will end up on your monitor.
3489829	3490829	Does it say that on the site?
3491369	3491570	No.
3491810	3493430	Oh, that's what happened to you?
3493571	3494291	A friendly warning.
3495552	3498373	I don't know how I would come up with that.
3499773	3501914	Other than I snorted Mountain Dew out of my nose.
3502094	3504155	You're welcome, because I gave that link to Jamie to begin with.
3504335	3504935	I hate you.
3506116	3506996	But not really, I lied.
3507036	3507957	Hopefully you had some Windex.
3509557	3512199	Loki, let's talk Guitar Hero.
3512299	3514139	Boy, talk about this game never calms down.
3514199	3515840	People just love their Guitar Hero.
3515960	3516640	Exactly.
3517301	3527605	And if you love the Guitar Hero game, you're going to love the Guitar Hero third-party controller being put out by Lixang, and it's called the Shredder.
3528049	3533931	It looks very similar to normal Guitar Hero guitar, except a little bit more metal, I would say.
3534131	3536713	The shredder... Yeah, it looks pretty neat.
3536833	3537213	I don't know.
3537293	3538733	What do you think, Jamie?
3539133	3544496	They had it on... It looks like it's trying to be a really deformed Gibson Thunderbird.
3546116	3547377	I want to smash it on stage.
3547737	3550338	I'm sorry, the shredder makes me think of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3550918	3552539	Maybe all that hardware for making coleslaw.
3554022	3554642	Perhaps.
3556803	3560204	It is quite steep, though, in price.
3560224	3563105	$48.90 was what the exchange rate ends up being.
3563345	3567567	A lot of price for aesthetics.
3568807	3574369	I would like to point out it took about three seconds for somebody in the chat room, Brack2000, to come up with a punchline.
3574770	3575930	What will they come up with next?
3575990	3576490	The Krag?
3576790	3577851	I'm sorry, the Krang?
3579191	3580272	The Krag is a different show.
3580332	3583793	If they do a drum game, then they'll come out with the foot.
3587033	3589834	Oh my god!
3590295	3590935	Boo!
3591375	3592375	Get off the show!
3592495	3592976	Get off!
3594436	3595077	Uh-uh.
3597037	3600359	Actually, a quote from someone who can't get into the chat room.
3602119	3604541	To the Shredder, I say, tonight we dine on turtle soup.
3606761	3607942	Anything else on the Shredder?
3608022	3610423	That was from Tiara, by the way.
3610723	3612224	Anything else on the Shredder, Loki?
3613744	3615125	It looks stupid.
3615882	3616722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3644653	3646034	GameCube, Tenchu, Time of the Assassins on PSP.
3675527	3682832	and, uh, I'll go ahead and jump to the 30th, which I will be repeating next week, but there's also a Def Jam fight for New York and the new Super Mario Bros.
3683693	3685274	So, uh, that's exciting.
3686475	3687316	New Super Mario Bros.
3687376	3688697	is pretty darn cool.
3689217	3690018	Glad you guys are getting it.
3690398	3692600	Eh, Magic kind of wore off after a few days, I don't know.
3692620	3692880	Hey!
3693620	3694081	Mario!
3694761	3699485	It's a good game and all, but I don't know, just kind of... Mario is hotness.
3699785	3699865	Yeah.
3699885	3700025	Yeah.
3700939	3704540	I'm more excited about the GameCube with the Super Paper Mario.
3704900	3705680	That looks hot.
3705700	3710241	Speaking of Mario, I noticed something today on my new shiny DS light screen.
3710381	3710621	Yes?
3711101	3720424	Well, with the increase in brightness and resolution on it, I noticed that if you have the arcade machine in your house in Animal Crossing, it's Mario vs. Luigi on a fighting game.
3722464	3725025	That is a hell of a lot of detail to notice.
3725085	3725505	Good job.
3725705	3726405	You have no life.
3727465	3727905	You know what?
3728506	3728746	Hi.
3729766	3729846	Uh...
3731417	3733779	What's coming out for our friends here stateside, Loki?
3733799	3734820	A whole lot of nothing.
3735441	3741146	Unless you like NFL Head Coach, in which case that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.
3741186	3742447	There's some folks that are into that.
3742527	3745229	We may not talk a lot about sports games, but there you go.
3745309	3746931	Okay, I'm not knocking sports games.
3746951	3748232	This is a sports strategy game.
3748252	3750033	You don't get to play the teams, you get to coach them.
3750314	3750754	Oh.
3751234	3754197	That's even like some sports fans won't even touch this.
3754217	3754597	Never mind.
3754617	3754958	But anyways...
3756300	3760041	Although, there is MotoGP 4, which is coming out on PlayStation 2.
3760441	3762981	Tomb Raider Legends, finally making it to PSP.
3763702	3767962	And Legend of Heroes 2, The Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch, also coming to PSP.
3768623	3775644	And for your DS fans, Sudoku Mania, yay, and Break Em All is going to be coming out.
3776084	3777604	And those are pretty lame.
3778425	3780005	Next week's going to be some good stuff, though.
3780725	3784746	I'm going to have to get one of the games that's coming out, even though I don't have an Xbox to play it on.
3785953	3786273	What's that?
3787153	3788714	Krusty Demon's Freestyle Motocross.
3790575	3791215	I've never heard of this.
3791335	3801078	Okay, this game is like a cross between Tony Hawk, an off-road game, and Flat Out.
3801138	3806680	Basically, it's like BMX XXX with motorcycles, is what it's like.
3807381	3807481	It's...
3809400	3810120	Fantastic.
3810140	3816384	You get points for injuring your rider, and it's just really cheeseball.
3816444	3816684	All right.
3816704	3817564	I'll tell you what, Loki.
3817885	3825048	Since I need to hang on to Oblivion a little while longer, I'll let you borrow the big green brick if you want to have an Xbox for a little while.
3825209	3826289	I have my big green brick outside.
3826309	3829931	Well, I have to pick up the game first, so I'll bring it over, and we'll see.
3830291	3830571	All right.
3831632	3832072	Sounds fair.
3833353	3838836	DarkSakura, we were on UK just a second ago, and there's actually a story that kind of affects them that you had.
3839554	3851979	Why, right, um, actually, uh, I can never pronounce this right, if it's Gamas, or Gamas, I would assume Gamasutra given Kamasutra, but, um, anyway, uh, a series of- We like it better that way because it's sexier.
3852400	3853180	It's so hot.
3853200	3856161	I mean, just, uh, special places.
3856381	3867206	Anyway, um, the, uh, video store, uh, Game, a big, uh, retailer in the UK, is going to be, uh, changing its, uh, return policy for software-
3868606	3889082	Right now basically a customer can return a game within 10 days as long as the packaging is complete but regardless of whether it's been opened or used now it's going to have its own seal on the packaging and if that seal is broken you will not be able to return it if it's broken within I believe 28 days.
3889102	3889162	Hmm.
3895086	3897387	I'm trying to see if there's a date on there.
3897427	3905569	Okay, this says that basically... I don't see the date when it's actually supposed to be rolling into effect, so I suppose it's already going into effect.
3906509	3909790	There's 700 owned and franchised stores in Europe.
3911310	3914030	There's 23 in the UK alone, 81 in continental Europe.
3917188	3925992	And basically, this is enacted because a lot of their profits went from 20 million pounds to 8.4 million.
3927773	3932315	That's basically in the series of 12 months that ended at the end of January this year.
3933835	3937757	So basically, they're enacting this, I'm pretty much guessing, to save their financial butt.
3939618	3939918	All right.
3940238	3940358	Hmm.
3941516	3944740	OrangeLoungeRadio.com One of the top games in Europe is a soccer management sim.
3959059	3959619	What do you do?
3987651	3990788	Soccer sounds like an abuse term.
3991479	3996921	Bandit would like to clarify, when I was offering to let you borrow the big green brick, is that an Xbox Halo edition?
3997001	3997441	Yes, it is.
3997481	3998861	That's when I finally caved and bought an Xbox.
3998881	4003583	That's when I have to, when my old Xbox died.
4003783	4006824	For quite a long time, I would not get an Xbox.
4006904	4007724	I thought they were crap.
4008104	4019228	I was of that school of thought where all the games that were on Xbox was nothing I was interested in, and then finally I caved right about the time the Halo Xbox had come out, and I thought, ooh, it's a pretty green one, too.
4019248	4019808	That's even better.
4020248	4021889	So that's when I finally caved and bought it.
4023930	4024410	All right.
4026431	4027452	Let's keep it moving here.
4027552	4029853	Loki has one more story for this segment.
4030554	4033195	And Bricks may or may not be involved in this.
4033235	4033755	Yes, Loki?
4033976	4035276	That's correct.
4036237	4038358	Uybol challenges you.
4038958	4040219	You, the bad reviewer.
4040639	4048824	No, basically Uybol has put out a press release saying that he wants to fight the people that are criticizing his movie.
4049744	4050424	His position?
4050664	4051604	I am fed up.
4051804	4055745	I am fed up with people slamming my films on the internet without seeing them.
4056165	4058826	Actually, they do still suck even after you watch them.
4059346	4067128	Many journalists make value judgments on my films based on the opinions of one or two thousand internet voices.
4067968	4072309	Half of the... Because one or two thousand people on the internet don't mean shit.
4073700	4074000	Okay, first off,
4091897	4095619	They kind of have a pretty good system there where you can't vote until the movie comes out.
4096220	4097460	So that's kind of invalid.
4097541	4098681	And two, it's IMDB.
4098861	4100883	Who gives a shit what your rating is on there?
4101263	4103784	It's a completely subjective website.
4103804	4108087	It has nothing to do with... It doesn't get published in a paper or something like that.
4108467	4109048	Who cares?
4110188	4111069	Well, anyways, it goes on.
4112082	4121753	So, it says, Ui is now challenging the critics that have failed to watch his films prior to reviewing or commenting to put up or shut up.
4124416	4127360	Towards the end of filming Postal, the five most
4127760	4132344	Outspoken critics will be flown into Vancouver and supplied with hotel rooms.
4132924	4145453	As a guest of Ui Bowl, they will be given the chance to be an extra slash stand-in in Postal and have the opportunity to put on boxing gloves and enter a boxing ring to fight Ui Bowl.
4145513	4150177	Each critic will have the opportunity to bring down Ui in a five-bout match.
4150757	4152940	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4170061	4173907	or at least two extremely negative articles in the year 2005.
4173967	4176711	Critics of 2006 will not be considered.
4177132	4182200	Please submit proof of your negative reviews and comments via email to info.bull.kg.com
4186941	4194451	KQ.E So you're being rewarded for bashing Uibo films by being in an Uibo film?
4194631	4197675	He's going to box you, but here's the thing that he forgot to mention.
4197995	4200779	He used to be a boxer, so that's not exactly fair.
4201099	4202882	By the way, you have to weigh between 140 and 190 pounds.
4205401	4206801	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4230083	4234427	I bet having a chick put her application in there, I bet that would be... You want to do it?
4234788	4236109	For the sake of the show, you want to fight him?
4238311	4238892	She's grinning.
4239813	4244037	I'll do it, and I'll watch his movies so I can be critical of them.
4244057	4246319	I'll be like, I wasted those four hours.
4246640	4247961	I want you two to figure it out.
4248001	4249923	Which one of you two is going to put in the application?
4250063	4251364	Because I'm too fat to fight him.
