1
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:19,512
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live here at the E3 Outpost for this special Thursday E3 2006 edition.

2
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome everybody to the Thursday edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live from the E3 Outpost, celebrating all things that is E3 2006.

3
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,652
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

4
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:49,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always, say hello to my exhausted yet perky co-host, DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:49,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

6
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:50,594
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

7
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I slept on the thingy.

8
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:53,635
[SPEAKER_05]: On the bus?

9
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:55,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate LA traffic.

10
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It took long enough that I could sleep.

11
00:00:57,966 --> 00:00:58,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a proper nap.

12
00:00:59,006 --> 00:00:59,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, whatever.

13
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:02,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,030
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

16
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:05,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

17
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:08,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I just ate a bunch of popcorn, chicken, and bacon out of these potato skins.

18
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Loving the catering at the E3 Outpost.

19
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:13,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I took the bacon and dipped it in barbecue sauce.

20
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:14,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Good people.

21
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:15,559
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,181
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I can do.

23
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:19,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Prove super bacon to the next level.

24
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:19,582
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

25
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:20,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time.

26
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:21,264
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

27
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, say hello.

28
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:24,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining us again tonight, our good pal, Bobby Blackwolf.

29
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:25,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo.

30
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:26,728
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Bobby?

31
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Tired, my feet hurt.

32
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:31,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I am all weed out.

33
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,195
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably how everybody feels about you after eating three today.

34
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:39,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, wave hello to Mr. Lawrence Young, who is producing us tonight.

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,182
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't have a mic, so he can't say hi back.

36
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:42,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is what he would say.

37
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:42,904
[SPEAKER_06]: That's me.

38
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:43,644
[SPEAKER_06]: That's me.

39
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:51,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, first of all, for those of you guys listening live tonight, it's about, what, 7.50 and we were supposed to be on at 6.30?

40
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, especially to those of you guys on the East Coast.

41
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:55,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap happens.

42
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:59,433
[SPEAKER_05]: We were actually at a booth right up until 5.45.

43
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:06,337
[SPEAKER_05]: We had an appointment at a booth, and so we actually missed the first shuttle back here to the outpost, so we had to wait for the second one.

44
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,297
[SPEAKER_05]: So I apologize.

45
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:08,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.

46
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:10,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Technical difficulties.

47
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:10,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway...

48
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:13,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about E3 and some of the stuff we saw today.

49
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,543
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play three interesting things.

50
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:19,005
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what's one of them?

51
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:27,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the Kings of Korea, or whatever they called it, and apparently one of the companies is bringing out a new Kunio game.

52
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:36,879
[SPEAKER_02]: They said 2007, but they're basically giving rebirth to the Kunio franchise, which I thought was pretty cool.

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And he seemed absolutely surprised that I would... Is that a Kunio game?! !

54
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:43,404
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who don't know what that is, was that a popular anime?

55
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It was brought over as River City Ransom.

56
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit!

57
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dodgeball.

58
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I needed to hear.

59
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:56,411
[SPEAKER_02]: But overseas it was Hot Blooded Downtown Story and Kunio's Dodgeball.

60
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,691
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this new game they're doing?

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really tell much about it because I don't read Korean.

62
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:03,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Kunio game.

63
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:03,845
[SPEAKER_05]: What did it look like?

64
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:04,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they playing a sport?

65
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:05,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they beating each other up?

66
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:06,826
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't show any pictures of it.

67
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like the artwork for it.

68
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:09,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Kunio game.

69
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:10,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't care.

70
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:11,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Kunio.

71
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:16,809
[SPEAKER_02]: The same guy who I surprised was also surprised that I played Ragnarok Online.

72
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:18,890
[SPEAKER_02]: He was apparently one of the people who worked on it.

73
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very cool.

74
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hey, you're my hero.

75
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,811
[SPEAKER_02]: You have created my addiction.

76
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,873
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to talk to DarkSakura about Kunio, you can join our chat room.

77
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:30,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It's chat.allgames.com for tonight.

78
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But everything is actually filtered through Bobby tonight.

79
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:37,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I left the Ibyuk at home.

80
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:40,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I call it the Ibyuk after Bjork because I love her.

81
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have my Ibyuk back at the hotel.

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura and Loki and myself have no way of seeing chat.

83
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Only Bobby.

84
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,443
[SPEAKER_06]: So be nice to me.

85
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see from here and I can laugh at people.

86
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:57,986
[SPEAKER_05]: We will take calls a little later on in the program, but if you're calling in right now, too bad, we're playing a game.

87
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:02,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to say something to Fantav.

88
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:06,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking for Gravity every year so I can ask him where's Ragnarok Online 2.

89
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't Ragnarok Online 2 supposed to be last year's E3?

90
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

91
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity never shows up.

92
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:15,193
[SPEAKER_02]: They're too busy banning people.

93
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:22,735
[SPEAKER_02]: There is actually a Wikipedia article up for Ragnarok Online, too, that has some of the features from previous information that's been leaked.

94
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you find something there.

95
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:25,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

96
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,055
[SPEAKER_02]: There hasn't been a site.

97
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:28,516
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a site for it, but it's a placeholder.

98
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:28,976
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

99
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:33,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, for those of you guys who are listening to us and going, God, those guys don't sound normal.

100
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:39,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's because we're at the E3 Outpost, and you get that nice ambient, the little club going on in the background.

101
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, ooh.

102
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:41,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's DJing down there?

103
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:42,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

104
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:42,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's?

105
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty funky.

106
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Lawrence is shaking his head.

107
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:45,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

108
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I can probably check my player.

109
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get his card after the show.

110
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:48,744
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

111
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:51,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what was something you saw today?

112
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,607
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard about Korean Kunio.

113
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,789
[SPEAKER_05]: What's something interesting you saw today, Loki?

114
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:58,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, something a bit more normal, I guess.

115
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:04,975
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually went and saw the Gears of War demonstration and that was pretty sexy, actually.

116
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:09,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally dig the way Microsoft has their theater set up.

117
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:12,013
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way you do it right there.

118
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:22,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the way Microsoft had their theater for Gears of War is that you actually went in and you would put these headphones on so that all the outside noise is blocked.

119
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:27,786
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can hear the Gears of War stuff clearly and that way you're not blasting the whole booth full of noise.

120
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also surround sound in the floor.

121
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So like when the guns went off, it vibrated your butt.

122
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:35,514
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly how this was last year.

123
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:39,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want a free butt massage at E3, go check out the Gears of War demo.

124
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,961
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of the game itself, though, Gears of War?

125
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it looked awesome.

126
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:47,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really into a lot of first-person shooters, but it looked pretty solid.

127
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:47,927
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked...

128
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:52,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen the Halo trailer yet, but I would say it probably looks better than Halo.

129
00:05:53,392 --> 00:05:55,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do a lot of first-person shooters either.

130
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:56,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I do do Halo.

131
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Halo's awesome.

132
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:01,300
[SPEAKER_05]: But Gears of War, what I liked about it is that it looked like it was really dummy-fied.

133
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of one-button stuff, because when...

134
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:09,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically the developer or whoever was showing it to us went through the game twice.

135
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,811
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time, or the level.

136
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:14,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time they went through the first level and just like jammed through it.

137
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:18,379
[SPEAKER_05]: They just jammed through the level and I was like, wow, that guy's doing a lot of shit.

138
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never be able to recreate that.

139
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:25,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the second time he went back through the game and showed how easy it was to be hacking people with chainsaws and all the cool stuff he was doing.

140
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,528
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very violent game.

141
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Very violent.

142
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very pretty, though.

143
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:39,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it was the only minor, minor bench I have is that there was some frame rate problems, but I'm hoping... I think that's just the video.

144
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:43,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just a develop or whatever it is issue, and that'll be gone by the time it actually rolls out.

145
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:48,982
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you guys that are into Halo, the fact that this thing has multiplayer, this is going to be your holdover for Halo 3.

146
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:50,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And it might even be...

147
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:54,885
[SPEAKER_05]: A real good, like, right up there competitor with Halo 3, like Half-Life, Quake, one of those.

148
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It might actually be coming out around the same time as Halo 3.

149
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:01,008
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they said 2006, so we're holding them to that.

150
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:04,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Halo's supposed to be in 2006 also.

151
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:04,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe it.

152
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I say Halo 3 not until next year.

153
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they said otherwise.

154
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:11,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a crap what they say.

155
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:11,912
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not true.

156
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,393
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have shown playable footage of E3 if it was true.

157
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:15,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

158
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:19,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, three interesting things, what's one of them?

159
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:23,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I kind of spent all day in one place, so it's kind of hard.

160
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:25,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well you've got to have seen at least three demos while you were there.

161
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:26,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did you spend your whole day?

162
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent my whole day playing with my Wii and Nintendo.

163
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:40,703
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys suck with your booth design making me wait in line for two hours so I could sit in other lines watching people play 20 minute demos.

164
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's four people in front of you, that's an hour just to play one game.

165
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Nintendo's booth this year.

166
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely hate it.

167
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about the games in it.

168
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:49,752
[SPEAKER_05]: The booth?

169
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:50,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it.

170
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It is horrible compared to the past two years.

171
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:55,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's atrocious.

172
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:56,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just...

173
00:07:58,503 --> 00:07:59,784
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do FUs of the week later.

174
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:00,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.

175
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:01,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we bring One Week in Angel?

176
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't.

177
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,167
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to sing it.

178
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,370
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, later.

179
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,732
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

180
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:13,095
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did get to play a lot with the Wii, and I'll pretty much start.

181
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:17,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the first thing that I'll talk about here is probably the tech demos and some of the stuff that they're doing.

182
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:18,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, wait.

183
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to help you here.

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,121
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the first thing you went for?

185
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:23,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you get in there, there's, what, 20 games in there.

186
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:26,286
[SPEAKER_05]: You must have went right to something.

187
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:26,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

188
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We Orchestra.

189
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you pick We Orchestra?

190
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was the first one in the little thing to go in.

191
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:38,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you just like, you're going to go in there like, I'm going to go around each and every one of these things?

192
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't quite set up like that.

193
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:43,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to get past this row of little mini living rooms, and then you got to the demo.

194
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, see, and We Orchestra was in the living room.

195
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:49,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the least packed living room.

196
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a music person, so...

197
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:58,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it, and for those since, you know, you guys don't, you know, here on Orange Songs Radio, you guys don't really know some of my background.

198
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually play symphonic percussion.

199
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:03,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I am in two wind symphonies in the Atlanta area.

200
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:06,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know how to conduct, because I have conducted before.

201
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:13,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I was trying to see is, I know Dance Dance Revolution is not a dancing simulator.

202
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,909
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't learn how to play guitar with Guitar Hero.

203
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,591
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't conduct with Wii Orchestra.

204
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:20,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very hard.

205
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:23,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to use real conducting techniques and it's not that good yet.

206
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,897
[SPEAKER_06]: You do have to treat it like a video game.

207
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:28,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.

208
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was interesting.

209
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,643
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you learn about the Wii controller today?

210
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned the tech specs of it.

211
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,531
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the tech specs of the Wiimote?

212
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what... I'm calling this the Wiimote.

213
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,614
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura says Wiicon.

214
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:49,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I say Wiimote.

215
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:53,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just always going to have this back and forth until Miyamoto can clear this up.

216
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:57,858
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Funnydale Final Furlong was right at the very end of the booth.

217
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:58,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

218
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:01,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

219
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo kept saying, making you think that it was kind of like a 3D mouse.

220
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be able to tell where it was in 3D space.

221
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:11,212
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be able to put the controller on the floor and know it was on the floor.

222
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:12,132
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not like that.

223
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:18,917
[SPEAKER_06]: It's accelerometers and an IR infrared blaster, just like your TV's remote control.

224
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:23,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of things, like people were saying, oh, it's so sensitive.

225
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,223
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when they were playing like the Duck Hunt thing.

226
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:31,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because it's an IR, and the receiver is that little sensor that has double-stick tape that you put under your TV.

227
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:34,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So the farther away you are from your TV, the less sensitive it is.

228
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,352
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you fix the sensitivity.

229
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:40,876
[SPEAKER_06]: But since we were two feet away from the screen, it was very, very, very sensitive.

230
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also the thing is they're going to be adjusting the sensitivity in there.

231
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:50,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have an adjustment very similar to like calibrating a mouse sensitivity.

232
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:55,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but I mean, what I'm saying is we could step back another foot and that would adjust the sensitivity as well.

233
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're not telling people that.

234
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:59,647
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to say it's some revolutionary technology.

235
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me more about the sensor.

236
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:02,989
[SPEAKER_06]: You said it's just a little piece of tape?

237
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a little piece.

238
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, it's not really tape.

239
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,691
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got double stick tape.

240
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,452
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it attaches to your TV.

241
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:09,753
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can put it on a table.

242
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:15,355
[SPEAKER_06]: As long, you know, because some people were asking, you know, okay, I have a projector and I project on my wall.

243
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:20,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, well, you know, you should mount it to the wall underneath where your screen is or something.

244
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:21,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

245
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:21,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And stuff.

246
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,897
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not used in every game.

247
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:29,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Only in the games that actually use the IR sensor, which Excite Truck is not one of.

248
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That only used the accelerometers in them.

249
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

250
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, some games don't even need that sensor.

251
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,182
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take that sensor away and still play Excite Truck.

252
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:38,882
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

253
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:40,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very interesting.

254
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Bobby's going to win round one of three interesting things, because that was very interesting.

255
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:46,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's mine.

256
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,411
[SPEAKER_05]: My interesting thing I saw was Luminous 2.

257
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:52,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and saw Luminous 2, which was being shown at Buena Vista Games.

258
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,996
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why Luminous 2 is interesting?

259
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:57,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see any damn difference from Luminous 1.

260
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a damn thing was different from Luminous 1.

261
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:07,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, some of the themes were different and it seemed to have more video in the background and they've changed the look.

262
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:12,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised because Luminous Live on Xbox looks a lot like Luminous 2.

263
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,137
[SPEAKER_05]: As for new modes, whatever else, it wasn't in the demo, so I couldn't tell you.

264
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And nobody at the booth told me anything extra.

265
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as I know, if you have Luminous, there's really no need to get Luminous 2.

266
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:28,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine they'll announce other things later, but they're not in the demo.

267
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I started the demo from scratch.

268
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:31,129
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes you right in the game.

269
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:32,670
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, some of the music was the same.

270
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some of the music and themes were the exact same.

271
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,805
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you got a second interesting thing for us?

272
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:57,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek Legacy.

273
00:12:58,817 --> 00:12:59,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes.

274
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:01,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this is the show that made us late.

275
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:01,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

276
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:06,829
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a meeting with Bethesda to see their demo for that.

277
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,592
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty sick.

278
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:18,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically can pick from any generation of the Star Trek universe with the exception of, I think, Enterprise.

279
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:22,319
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Enterprise is in there all five generations.

280
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,160
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Enterprise was not there.

281
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,141
[SPEAKER_02]: As in the series Enterprise.

282
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the series Enterprise, not the ship.

283
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:32,745
[SPEAKER_07]: No, according to the trailer that they had, it included Enterprise.

284
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:39,909
[SPEAKER_02]: According to them, they had Original Series, they had Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.

285
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,470
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

286
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:12,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... They actually, on the demo, they recreated the battle from The Wrath of Khan.

287
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:13,957
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty awesome.

288
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:15,998
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is a Trekkie's wet dream.

289
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:16,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

290
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,619
[SPEAKER_05]: They went all out.

291
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:25,421
[SPEAKER_05]: They have everything nailed down, like the ship specs, like you're saying, the recreation of certain scenarios.

292
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:30,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, if you're into Star Trek, you're going to think it's great.

293
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:32,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You have full range of motion in that game.

294
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,305
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, if you are a little bit...

295
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:36,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a tactical ship game too.

296
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:41,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually thought when we were going in there, I thought we were going to see the Star Trek MMO, which is nowhere to be seen.

297
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's still in early development, but...

298
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,306
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

299
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:19,675
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely very complete for the Star Trek hardcore fan.

300
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:21,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they went to all these resources.

301
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:28,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And even for the casual Trek fan, it's going to have tutorial modes that ease you into it and easy scenarios type situations.

302
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:30,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very pretty to look at.

303
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:31,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a pretty, pretty game.

304
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very impressed with Star Trek Legacy.

305
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:36,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Thumbs up.

306
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:38,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

307
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:38,762
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

308
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:41,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, one interesting thing.

309
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:44,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to play more of the PlayStation 2 today.

310
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,770
[SPEAKER_07]: The interesting part... Why don't you come over to my house and play PlayStation 2?

311
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:49,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean PlayStation 3?

312
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:50,612
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3.

313
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:52,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I played both today.

314
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:52,654
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

315
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:54,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it only.

316
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:55,776
[SPEAKER_07]: No, PlayStation 3.

317
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:58,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually played two different games.

318
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the thing.

319
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:05,769
[SPEAKER_07]: The surprising thing is I'm not impressed by PlayStation 3 at all.

320
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:11,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played one of the games I've been looking forward to ever since I saw the video, MotorStorm.

321
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:12,780
[SPEAKER_07]: What...

322
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:17,965
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you like about the movie that you saw?

323
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:33,934
[SPEAKER_07]: What I liked about the movie, the movie made it seem like it's going to be burnout off-road type of thing.

324
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:40,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Really fast, really crazy-ass gameplay where cars are just crashing and flipping all over the place and exploding.

325
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:42,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire, just lots of stuff like that.

326
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was the reality of the demo?

327
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,698
[SPEAKER_07]: The reality of the demo was it was just an off-road game.

328
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:49,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Cars seemed to be driving extremely slow.

329
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,000
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, you know, a lot of times you'd fall off a cliff or whatever.

330
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,082
[SPEAKER_07]: If you did happen to crash, they would do a slow-mo instant replay of it, and it was very unimpressive.

331
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I checked out Gran Turismo HD and also not impressed by it at all.

332
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the paper people.

333
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:26,805
[SPEAKER_07]: They're back.

334
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:28,246
[SPEAKER_07]: In high def.

335
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:29,467
[SPEAKER_07]: 1080p.

336
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:32,629
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually kind of 3D, but they don't move.

337
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,771
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just kind of stationary.

338
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,593
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Grand Canyon level, they do move.

339
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:37,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little bit.

340
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:38,594
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing.

341
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:43,599
[SPEAKER_07]: If you drive past them, they're still looking behind you down the track like something's going to happen.

342
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:44,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's give them a break, though.

343
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,041
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an early, early build.

344
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,662
[SPEAKER_05]: That all might still change.

345
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:48,343
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

346
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:50,203
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty.

347
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:51,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give it that.

348
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,504
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not the only game that uses paper people.

349
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:55,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, let's look at MotoGP 2006.

350
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I played that today also.

351
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:58,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Same problem.

352
00:17:58,706 --> 00:18:02,787
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing is, it's not impressive enough to get me to spend more money.

353
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:07,429
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing has got to be leaps and bounds better than the 360 in order for me to spend that kind of money.

354
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:13,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really not seeing anything really unique and revolutionary coming out for anything on the PlayStation 3.

355
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all just more of the same crap, just prettier.

356
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:27,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I did notice though that Sonic the Hedgehog and there's a few other games I think that were on both platforms looked a little better on the PlayStation 3.

357
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:29,036
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sonic looked a little bit better.

358
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:36,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Mobile Suit Gundam looked extremely better than the 360 version.

359
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's the monitors that they're playing on, but it looked like night and day for that.

360
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:45,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty Graphics can't make me forgive the botched job done on Sonic.

361
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Bobby, how's the chatroom doing?

362
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,070
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing fine.

363
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,932
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bitching about G4 right now, actually.

364
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:56,653
[SPEAKER_06]: They're asking if we went by G4's booth and what was going on.

365
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:58,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I avoided it at all costs.

366
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:05,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a bunch of monkeys outside the booth today going, Oh my god!

367
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,678
[SPEAKER_05]: What were they cheering for?

368
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Attack of the Show, I think, was live.

369
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Mom, I'm on TV.

370
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Kevin Pereira, I want to suck your dick.

371
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

372
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

373
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, not for me.

374
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:19,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I kept running into them today.

375
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:22,233
[SPEAKER_07]: They have, like, group babes doing, like, weird things.

376
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:28,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you brought this up when we were walking around, that there was not a swarm of G4 people like there was in years past.

377
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:30,095
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because they're not a gaming channel.

378
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:30,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right, I know.

379
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,535
[SPEAKER_05]: They're off getting guys.

380
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:33,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

381
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:34,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they get you?

382
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:37,599
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's their slogan.

383
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,479
[SPEAKER_05]: We get guys.

384
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:39,420
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all getting guys.

385
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,240
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm asking you.

386
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they get you?

387
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:41,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

388
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:42,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they get you?

389
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:42,662
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

390
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:43,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

391
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:45,663
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't have me.

392
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:47,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I hid from them.

393
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:48,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, though.

394
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:53,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I see swarms of GameTap shirts, which is okay because I like GameTap.

395
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:54,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

396
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:56,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was surprised at that.

397
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're working for GameTap.

398
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Was GameTap giving away something to shirt holders?

399
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,334
[SPEAKER_05]: They were giving away shirts.

400
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:04,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed that one out.

401
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:08,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but you don't wear your shirts that you win the next day.

402
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people do.

403
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:12,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

404
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:12,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

405
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,640
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a freak.

406
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,803
[SPEAKER_05]: The shirts I get at E3, I wear to the gym, which isn't very often, but that's where they get used.

407
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:25,405
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my wardrobe is all my E3 shirts, and I haven't gotten a single one this year.

408
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:26,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

409
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be naked next week, and I'm a fat man, so that's not a good thing.

410
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

411
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:51,708
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

412
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:08,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a clock from the Korean people.

413
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:10,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty soon E3 is going to be online.

414
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine, though, because I hate traffic here.

415
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they'd move E3 to Vegas or somewhere that's built to hold a convention.

416
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:18,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should bring it back to Atlanta.

417
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:19,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved it when it was in Atlanta.

418
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you have selfish reasons for that.

419
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:25,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually wouldn't mind going to Atlanta.

420
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:26,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't mind either.

421
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:26,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's a great place.

422
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then I can go to E3 and drive back to Mobile and hang out with my family and then fly home.

423
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:31,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you're right.

424
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:35,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear ESA, please have E3 in Mr. Blackwell's backyard.

425
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:36,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

426
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:39,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Bobby, one interesting thing.

427
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:40,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one, number two.

428
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:41,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, another one.

429
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:46,410
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing, since more Wii, since apparently I played the Wii all day today.

430
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:47,631
[SPEAKER_05]: You played with your Wii all day long.

431
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:48,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I played with my Wii.

432
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:49,232
[SPEAKER_06]: That's impressive.

433
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:50,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing.

434
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:57,216
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are actually wondering about, and this is more about the IR games.

435
00:21:57,556 --> 00:22:00,438
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, oh, my arm's going to get tired when I play these games all that much.

436
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Your arm gets tired after you play with your Wii too long.

437
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:30,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, WarioWare does make you do hula hoops and squats and stuff like that, but not all the games are going to really tire you out.

438
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:38,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I thought that was kind of interesting, you know, how natural I could actually be laying on the couch and playing some of these games.

439
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:42,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there actually need to be more games that wear people out.

440
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,462
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura wants Wii Torture Chamber.

441
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,522
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't want Wii Torture Chamber.

442
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:57,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I want, like, Wii Robics and, like, Wii Boot Camp.

443
00:22:57,864 --> 00:22:59,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii Boot Camp sounds better.

444
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:00,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii Boot Camp.

445
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think about Dance Aerobics and I'm like...

446
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,532
[SPEAKER_05]: They could fully bring back Dance Aerobics on the Wii.

447
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:06,912
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

448
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:11,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Hook up a DDR mat and then have the controller and there you go.

449
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:13,756
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much the same thing with the eye toy.

450
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:17,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this is by Nintendo, so it'll be better.

451
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:17,818
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be awesome.

452
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:19,019
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it and I know it.

453
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,161
[SPEAKER_05]: If they brought out a new Dance Aerobics, you'd play it once and that would be it.

454
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:23,141
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

455
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:23,842
[SPEAKER_05]: That's me.

456
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:24,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I would.

457
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:26,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

458
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: My second interesting thing I saw today would be the Eye of Judgment.

459
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:32,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you make your judgment on it?

460
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I did make a judgment on it.

461
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:38,730
[SPEAKER_05]: What a waste of fucking space at the PlayStation 3 booth.

462
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,431
[SPEAKER_05]: What a waste of fucking space.

463
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:50,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry to the guys that developed this because I'm sure they worked very hard on this, but now is not the time to be showing me the eye of judgment.

464
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,557
[SPEAKER_05]: The eye of judgment could have been done on the PS2.

465
00:23:54,994 --> 00:24:08,442
[SPEAKER_05]: From my perspective, now granted I don't know any tech stuff about PS3, the Eye of Judgment, for those that don't know what the Eye of Judgment is, it's that thing they showed at the conference where you put the car down and whoosh, a monster comes onto the screen.

466
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:09,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like Yu-Gi-Oh.

467
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:15,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's supposed to be a game, but the people admitted that it wasn't really a game but more like a tech demo.

468
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:16,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

469
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:18,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you saw the Eye of Judgment.

470
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:18,809
[SPEAKER_05]: What was your thoughts?

471
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:19,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

472
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:30,638
[SPEAKER_07]: When basically you have to put down a card and the eye toy, or it wasn't really an eye toy, it was just a camera, would recognize these barcode light things on top and bottom of the card.

473
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's also like four triangles on it to kind of orient the card so it knows which direction it's facing because that's important.

474
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:41,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it will spawn whatever monster based on what card it is.

475
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Now here's the thing that really kind of bugged me about it.

476
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:56,312
[SPEAKER_07]: You can cast spells on your monsters as well, but the spell card is put on top of the monster card, and you have to remember to take the card off after the spell is cast, otherwise it casts again, because it's stupid.

477
00:24:56,952 --> 00:25:05,099
[SPEAKER_07]: and also if you're playing the game and happen to destroy a monster you have to remember to take it off the board otherwise it spawns the monster again because it's stupid.

478
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Eye of Judgment has an IQ of about 3.

479
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:12,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the other thing that the geniuses... They need a brain of judgment.

480
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:14,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the geniuses that Sony didn't think about.

481
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:18,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this game uses actual cards like magic cards or something like that.

482
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:23,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're actually going to be playing this game, they're playing on selling expansion packs later on.

483
00:25:23,716 --> 00:25:24,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the only problem here.

484
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:29,021
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably scan those cards and print them back out again, and there you go.

485
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:33,886
[SPEAKER_07]: You have two cards because the camera's not going to know the difference between a fake and a real card.

486
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:39,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, who are those cats in Ken's show we saw the first day that are here tonight?

487
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:40,515
[SPEAKER_05]: NoVint Falcon.

488
00:25:40,615 --> 00:25:41,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, NoVint.

489
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,296
[SPEAKER_05]: N-O-V-I-N-T.

490
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:46,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Describe NoVint for the listeners real quick, and there's a reason I'm doing this.

491
00:25:46,298 --> 00:26:00,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, NoVint Falcon, basically what it is, it's a PC peripheral, and it takes USB, and essentially it has touch sensitive, so it's a little ball, and I will link it in chat because I've got to go find it on Google, and I'll put the link in chat.

492
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:03,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's NoVint.com slash Falcon.htm or something like that.

493
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:13,695
[SPEAKER_06]: You put your fingers on this little ball, and say there is a ball on the screen, you actually push forward and it will stop at the ball.

494
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:21,439
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually trace around the ball, and then if they have ridges on it, you can actually feel the ridges as you touch the ball.

495
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you have balls, you can have a rubber band, and it will actually pull you around.

496
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:30,224
[SPEAKER_05]: You can feel your balls right there in your hand.

497
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have gone from the weed to the balls.

498
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:33,927
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but seriously though.

499
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:35,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Explicit tag, here we come.

500
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:37,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we have to explicit this show.

501
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,258
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is that these are all tech demos.

502
00:26:42,638 --> 00:26:45,780
[SPEAKER_05]: But this, they also have, what was it, Half-Life they were showing?

503
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,561
[SPEAKER_05]: They had Half-Life 2 and something else.

504
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:48,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are here tonight.

505
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:49,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

506
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Now here's the thing.

507
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,464
[SPEAKER_05]: That, I went and played that and I thought, this is great.

508
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:55,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Why isn't this on a console?

509
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:59,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what Sony should be having in their little rooms right now.

510
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:03,389
[SPEAKER_05]: The Eye of Judgment is, it is not time for the Eye of Judgment.

511
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

512
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,430
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

513
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have been far more impressed if Sony had teamed up with those NoVent guys and were showing that thing.

514
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:13,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a smart name to be calling that either.

515
00:27:14,386 --> 00:27:15,266
[SPEAKER_07]: The Eye of Judgment.

516
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:19,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I judge this crap.

517
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:23,231
[SPEAKER_05]: It is NoVent.com.

518
00:27:23,271 --> 00:27:24,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to keep things moving.

519
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:27,774
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys are listening live, Gamer Andy will be on momentarily.

520
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:28,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking right at him.

521
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:29,275
[SPEAKER_05]: He's sitting there.

522
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Gamer Andy.

523
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:31,896
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

524
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:33,857
[SPEAKER_05]: We're starting to butt into his time a little bit.

525
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

526
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:35,238
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

527
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:00,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on PSP.

528
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty!

529
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:07,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this is not the same as the Capcom Classics thing that also has Ghosts and Goblins, right?

530
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an all-new Ghosts and Goblins game.

531
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,976
[SPEAKER_05]: What's so funky new about it?

532
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:16,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get golden armor, you get, like, blue pimp armor or something.

533
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:23,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, one of the enemies, the new one, is these hands that reach out of the ground and grab you and, like, throw you into a vat of acid or...

534
00:28:25,134 --> 00:28:28,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go on one of the bosses, because I actually knew weapons.

535
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:29,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a refillable life bar.

536
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:55,238
[SPEAKER_02]: But when that's out, then you turn into the naked guy.

537
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:56,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.

538
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems to help the difficulty a little bit, I think.

539
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:03,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually avoided them at first because I thought they were the holy water, and the holy water sucks.

540
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:05,906
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your weapons is a crossbow.

541
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:08,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have little bombs.

542
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:14,712
[SPEAKER_02]: You start off with the lances, of course, which I still think are the better weapon.

543
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:17,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You also get a vine whip, which really sucks ass.

544
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:33,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Another cool thing about that, this made me laugh, I actually took a little bit of video of this, sort of stealthily, is one of the curse forms that he can get is as a woman.

545
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:35,074
Wow.

546
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:37,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I would think that would be a blessing.

547
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:39,037
[SPEAKER_02]: What a curse indeed.

548
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:46,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, it actually made the boss fight better, because she is like in this big, she looks very...

549
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:52,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Peasant German, you know, like you see in the old history books.

550
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:59,744
[SPEAKER_02]: In a big dress, and she'd sort of float in the air, sort of like Princess Peach.

551
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was cool because you could still attack.

552
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:03,747
[SPEAKER_02]: She would just move slower, like a really huge woman.

553
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:06,949
[SPEAKER_02]: But you throw attacks while you're floating in the air, and you could still hit the boss.

554
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:12,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually ended up being more convenient, but of course when you get hit, you lose the form again.

555
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,355
[SPEAKER_02]: But I enjoyed it immensely.

556
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,556
[SPEAKER_02]: The music was still good.

557
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:21,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also right next to Tekken, so I was going between the two for a while.

558
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:29,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But, my, you know, and I actually wasn't too sure about it at first until I talked to Dan on the phone yesterday.

559
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,912
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you were going to go play Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

560
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

561
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did, and I had a good time.

562
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:36,693
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty fun.

563
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:42,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was almost hanging out with Julie, Custom E19, who she was over there playing Ace Combat.

564
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:43,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

565
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:44,517
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, I don't like this game.

566
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:47,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, go play Ghosts and Goblins.

567
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:48,519
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, no.

568
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it was great.

569
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fantastic.

570
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:52,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

571
00:30:53,934 --> 00:31:00,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the surprising game that I saw today was this game that's probably from a company no one's ever heard of.

572
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:07,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually by this group called On Games, and the game was called Wild Summer.

573
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:08,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Now,

574
00:31:09,774 --> 00:31:18,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, this game is like a sandbox game, very similar to Grand Theft Auto, but it's basically like kind of a plotline to American Pie.

575
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:24,029
[SPEAKER_07]: You're this, you know, trouble-starting teenager, you know, with hormones raging.

576
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, tell them why we went to look at this game.

577
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:32,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I saw the game and I'm like, ooh, I gotta go play that because it looked like Laser Suit Larry.

578
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:32,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I...

579
00:31:33,078 --> 00:31:38,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I saw the poster and it showed this teenage boy that was stealing panties off a clothesline.

580
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I have to see whatever that fucking game is.

581
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks too unreal to be true.

582
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:48,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, it looks amazing so far.

583
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:50,662
[SPEAKER_07]: They still have about a year and a half of development left.

584
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be coming out in fall of 2007.

585
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:57,164
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, it's going to be... They've got a ton of different stuff in here.

586
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,565
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that they were showing was the kind of...

587
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what was it?

588
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:05,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the free-running type of stuff in there.

589
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:07,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're jumping from buildings and stuff.

590
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,912
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of have the same Prince of Persia, like, gameplay.

591
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:16,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It also has, you know, a bunch of mini-games, including, like, dancing, playing beach volleyball.

592
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:20,618
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have a dating part in it, too, kind of like a dating sim.

593
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:24,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way the dating sim is, it's going to be playing, like, Magic the Gathering.

594
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:30,545
[SPEAKER_07]: You're actually going to have, like, cards for, you know, pretend you're interested in her conversation, you know, get her drunk.

595
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:31,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff like that.

596
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:33,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very ambitious game.

597
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like there's a lot they want to do with it.

598
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was really impressed with the guy.

599
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were very nice to us, too.

600
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like they've gone into a lot of detail.

601
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:49,095
[SPEAKER_05]: They've really thought out about what they want to do, like what their dream game is.

602
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going and doing it.

603
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked this question.

604
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:53,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jamie, you might appreciate this.

605
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:53,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

606
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, why would a woman ever want to play this game?

607
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:59,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, what is in this for a woman?

608
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what they said is that we have women on staff helping us write this game.

609
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:06,881
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not out to make a tacky game.

610
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:09,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Leisure Suit Larry is now a tacky franchise.

611
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:13,164
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out to make a fun game.

612
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:15,865
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why there's no nudity in this game.

613
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:16,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

614
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:17,705
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no nudity.

615
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:19,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not perverted.

616
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:25,169
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just silly fun, like the American Pie or Porky's movies, those types of things.

617
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:26,930
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a little bit of dumb fun.

618
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So they think that women might want to play it just because it's silly.

619
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:32,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not meant to be a serious game.

620
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:34,074
[SPEAKER_05]: That was interesting.

621
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:35,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested.

622
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:36,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

623
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:37,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look.

624
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:38,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked by it.

625
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was over there.

626
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:40,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested.

627
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:41,098
[SPEAKER_02]: What turns you on?

628
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:45,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see what fun it is to play a hormonal 16-year-old.

629
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:50,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you haven't been a hormonal 16-year-old boy, so... Exactly.

630
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:52,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no interest in it.

631
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing that links it to me.

632
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I was spending my 16-year-old kicking off the horny 16-year-old boys.

633
00:33:59,244 --> 00:33:59,764
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

634
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,786
[SPEAKER_07]: They still have Desperate Housewives out there.

635
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:02,786
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

636
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:03,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

637
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:05,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Desperate Housewives will teach you how to cook and gossip.

638
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:06,549
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I found out today.

639
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:07,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised.

640
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,633
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually go into extreme detail on cooking in that game.

641
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:15,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like, you know, you can pick from recipes and all this crap...

642
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need a video game to teach me how to cook.

643
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:23,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so glad I'm on the edge of this stage so I can just run down the stairs as quick as possible.

644
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:25,051
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done this for years.

645
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:28,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of these days, I'm going to combust.

646
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:30,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll be right next to me.

647
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually surprised at how thorough the Desperate Housewives game looked to be.

648
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:36,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually kind of surprised.

649
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really intricate game, but it's stupid.

650
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:41,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

651
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:43,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great game, but stupid.

652
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's intricate, but stupid.

653
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:46,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Intricately stupid.

654
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:47,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

655
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:48,206
[SPEAKER_05]: What a waste.

656
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:48,826
[SPEAKER_05]: What a waste.

657
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:50,606
[SPEAKER_05]: But Wild Summer, you know what?

658
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be cute.

659
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:52,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see it.

660
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:58,929
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working on getting it on the 360, and to be honest, there's nothing like it out there, especially on the 360.

661
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had other games, too, that looked pretty good.

662
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,830
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've got to keep it moving, guys.

663
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, one more interesting thing from today.

664
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:11,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Going for the Wii trifecta, because I just can't stop talking about my Wii.

665
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:16,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wouldn't that be a Triforce, Bobby, a Triforce?

666
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:17,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

667
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:19,524
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be here till Friday.

668
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:20,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

669
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,087
[SPEAKER_06]: The virtual console.

670
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:30,770
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually had two demo units running of the Virtual Console with that new controller that they were showing that looks like a Super Nintendo controller with dual analog sticks.

671
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

672
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a very light controller, very comfortable to me.

673
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:36,812
[SPEAKER_06]: They had five games running.

674
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:39,053
[SPEAKER_06]: They had one for each system, pretty much.

675
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:39,953
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Super Mario Bros.

676
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:47,915
[SPEAKER_06]: on the NES, Super Mario World on the SNES, Super Mario 64 on the N64, Sonic the Hedgehog on Genesis, and Bonk's Adventure on the TurboGrafx.

677
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:48,275
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, okay.

678
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:16,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll back off.

679
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:20,797
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, though, I haven't played a TurboGrafx in so long.

680
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:23,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that Bonks worked really well.

681
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looked fine to me.

682
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't notice any glitches or anything, but I can't compare it to the original TurboGrafx.

683
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:29,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it tell you to press run?

684
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:32,764
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

685
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:52,971
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

686
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:55,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat room question from a while ago.

687
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:56,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, please.

688
00:36:56,232 --> 00:36:56,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

689
00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:57,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, chat room again.

690
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:02,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the ibyuk, so we can't look at chat, Jamie and I. But Bobby, what's chat room say?

691
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:07,195
[SPEAKER_06]: CKY Mike, who thinks I should join you guys full time, asked what game... You want to move to Sacramento?

692
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:08,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll move to Sacramento.

693
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:08,436
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

694
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:08,736
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

695
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:11,536
[SPEAKER_06]: What game demos did you get to download at the PSP booth?

696
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:12,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's a Matt thing.

697
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:13,517
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Loki thing.

698
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:16,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded Gangs of London

699
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:31,184
[SPEAKER_07]: was one of them.

700
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:32,905
[SPEAKER_07]: They had Lemmings.

701
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:38,828
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I played, Every Extended Extra.

702
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:40,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Every Extended Extra.

703
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:41,270
[SPEAKER_07]: E3.

704
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was okay.

705
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:47,374
[SPEAKER_07]: They had Ratchet & Clank Size Matters.

706
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:48,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I played that for a little bit.

707
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:49,055
[SPEAKER_07]: That was okay.

708
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:52,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I can't remember what the last game was.

709
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,418
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't that standout.

710
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:58,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Every extended extra seemed okay to me.

711
00:37:58,358 --> 00:37:59,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It was weird.

712
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,199
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little weird.

713
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't what I expected from Q Entertainment, but I think it'll be a good time.

714
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how they reused some of the sound effects from Luminous.

715
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was funny.

716
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:11,123
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

717
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,403
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have an honorable mention.

718
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:15,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, let's do quick, real quick, though.

719
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:16,665
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to try and start wrapping this up.

720
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:20,206
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to take a couple quick, quick phone calls, though.

721
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:21,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, tell them how to get in.

722
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you can call 1-866-880-0156.

723
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:27,953
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

724
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:29,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul free number in the United States.

725
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Some quickies first, DarkSakura.

726
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:31,954
[SPEAKER_05]: WTF.

727
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:34,376
[SPEAKER_05]: The WTF game is amazing.

728
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:36,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I chopped rabbits in half.

729
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,157
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

730
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:39,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the wood chopping game.

731
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:44,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's a bunch of really, really messed up mini games.

732
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:50,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that Julie and I actually played was the wood chopping game, where you chop wood for money.

733
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:53,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Only the thing is that the grandma lady will randomly put out an animal.

734
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:58,151
[SPEAKER_05]: The chicken sorting game was fantastic because you could do... It looks very WarioWare-ish.

735
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:00,873
[SPEAKER_05]: You sort them as boys, girls, or dead.

736
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:01,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha ha!

737
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:04,016
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I said, what, Heaven?

738
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:04,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Heaven.

739
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:06,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're dead.

740
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:07,218
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they go to Heaven.

741
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:07,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's great.

742
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:09,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That made me go WTF.

743
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:09,840
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great town.

744
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,441
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've got to go.

745
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:11,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It was work time fun.

746
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:12,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the telephone.

747
00:39:12,963 --> 00:39:14,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

748
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:14,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

749
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:16,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Seproth1215.

750
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Seproth1215, what's on your mind?

751
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:20,269
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to make it quick tonight.

752
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:27,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I was going to say, there has been a little bit of an update for the Imani booth.

753
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:28,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

754
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:32,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not hear, you said Guitar Freaks broke?

755
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:35,322
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Guitar Freaks was a response to Guitar Hero

756
00:39:56,605 --> 00:40:03,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they had the guitar freaks and the mania there to have people come over to their booth.

757
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:03,996
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

758
00:40:04,316 --> 00:40:13,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a press attention thing showing, I think they wanted to show, look at our arcade machines, look at, we are bringing the arcade experience home.

759
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:18,152
[SPEAKER_05]: But the weird thing about that, I don't understand the logic of a Guitar Freaks being there.

760
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:23,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I still don't, but maybe they want to show, hey, we've been doing this in the arcade for a long time.

761
00:40:23,997 --> 00:40:27,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not one to say why they have that there, if it is a response to Guitar Hero or what.

762
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:34,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe they're like me in seeing how non-innovative Guitar Hero is, because it's been out forever in Japan as Guitar Freaks.

763
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:38,428
[SPEAKER_05]: See, but I disagree, because I do think Guitar Hero is innovative, but in a different way than you do.

764
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you don't, I should say.

765
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:40,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

766
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:44,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was the other part of that you said that they were reporting, Sephiroth?

767
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:49,789
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that 2DX was there because of...

768
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:55,041
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted to show the press how cool it would be and the potential that it has.

769
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:57,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with that.

770
00:40:57,102 --> 00:41:06,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not show the press the arc- Because a lot of people, when the Beatmania trailer showed, it said bringing the arcade experience home, and a lot of people said, what arcade experience?

771
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Konami just wanted to show what these games look like.

772
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:14,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you what, there were lots of cameras filming both of those games.

773
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:16,870
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Konami wants, people filming their stuff.

774
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing wrong with a little attention, right?

775
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:32,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, but the problem with that is they did say that they don't have any plans for another US sequel because they don't know whether or not it's sold well enough.

776
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:41,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the problem I have with that is if I look back on DDR, I mean, they went on for a while and probably didn't sell well until maybe at least Max.

777
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it did sell pretty well.

778
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:48,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that was the nice way of saying, we just can't tell you anything right now.

779
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:53,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, honestly, that was the nice way of saying, we can't talk about it.

780
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:55,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

781
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll hope so too.

782
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Seproth, we gotta let you go to take another call, but thanks for calling, alright?

783
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, thanks.

784
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:04,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we got another one already?

785
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:05,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, real quick, before we answer this.

786
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:07,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

787
00:42:07,703 --> 00:42:08,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you had a comment.

788
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:09,024
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

789
00:42:09,184 --> 00:42:10,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, alright, we'll go to the phone.

790
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:11,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

791
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is SilentWind96 again.

792
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,601
[SPEAKER_05]: SilentWind96.

793
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to meet you last night.

794
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:19,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

795
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thanks for getting me in, guys.

796
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:22,686
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

797
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,527
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of the E3 Outpost?

798
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:26,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I loved it.

799
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,189
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot of fun.

800
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:27,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

801
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,411
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in the LA area, come on down.

802
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,012
[SPEAKER_05]: We're right off Santa Monica and 405.

803
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:33,895
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you call in about?

804
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:39,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to extend my thanks again for letting me hang out with you guys.

805
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:42,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on my way home back to Bakersfield.

806
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:48,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to be up at 3 o'clock in the morning to go to work.

807
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:49,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor guy.

808
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:50,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the call.

809
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:51,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you had a good time.

810
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:53,467
[SPEAKER_05]: What was something fun you did while you were here?

811
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:03,296
[SPEAKER_09]: At the outpost, I was able to talk to some of the guys from Intellivision and

812
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:07,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out the demo for Lost Planet, which is awesome.

813
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:08,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

814
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:15,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch Bobby Platt kick in Uno by the computer.

815
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:17,024
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

816
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:22,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, SilentWind96 brought us the full version of Uno for us to take a look at.

817
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:23,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love him for it.

818
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:24,566
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you guys think of Uno?

819
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:27,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had a little bit to drink.

820
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:28,907
[SPEAKER_02]: A little.

821
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:31,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was sitting back going, Uno.

822
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:33,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

823
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:36,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Uno.

824
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:38,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I had four Astro Smashes.

825
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:39,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Wolf?

826
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:44,448
[SPEAKER_06]: The computer is a cheese monkey.

827
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,609
[SPEAKER_02]: The computer is a bitch.

828
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:47,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

829
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,010
[SPEAKER_02]: The computer is evil.

830
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he went for...

831
00:43:56,246 --> 00:43:56,926
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

832
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,715
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me warm and fuzzy and kind of ill.

833
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:24,256
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

834
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:24,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

835
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:25,857
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

836
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:28,419
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my thought, too.

837
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to get my own gamer tag now.

838
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,202
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

839
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:35,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Wind, any other thoughts for our listeners?

840
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:40,767
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just that if you ever get a chance to go down there, that's a great place to hang out.

841
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:44,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate your support.

842
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:46,107
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a true buddy.

843
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And what do you think of the set here?

844
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this set.

845
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:53,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Silent Wind, what did you think of the set?

846
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I love the NES.

847
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,731
[SPEAKER_09]: The NES set was awesome.

848
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:15,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I did take pictures with Sky's camera.

849
00:45:15,152 --> 00:45:15,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good.

850
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:16,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get those up on the site.

851
00:45:17,093 --> 00:45:17,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

852
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:20,395
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Silent Wind, we've got to let you go because you're going to get more calls.

853
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:21,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for calling in, all right?

854
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:23,136
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, you take care now.

855
00:45:23,176 --> 00:45:23,916
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you too, buddy.

856
00:45:23,936 --> 00:45:24,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good to meet you.

857
00:45:25,477 --> 00:45:32,560
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that was Silent Wind, our random contest winner from last night who got to come down here and be on the E3 Outpost.

858
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out here.

859
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:38,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, remind the kids how to call in if they want.

860
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:38,933
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a couple more.

861
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:40,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Toll free number in the United States, 1-866-880-0156.

862
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to mention another cool game I played was Hot Pixel.

863
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,196
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was awesome.

864
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:57,664
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just basically WarioWare on the PSP with old retro Atari games in there as well.

865
00:45:58,224 --> 00:45:59,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Friggin' awesome.

866
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:01,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of good WarioWare type games coming to the PSP.

867
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:03,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean Atari was showing more than one game?

868
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:04,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

869
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:09,286
[SPEAKER_07]: HotPixel is fun.

870
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:13,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy, I guess, who made it or whatever is a crazy-ass French guy.

871
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he has this weird skateboard with carpet on it and a fucking PSP holder in there.

872
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:20,394
[SPEAKER_07]: What a nut.

873
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:21,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

874
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:22,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool.

875
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:23,897
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice to meet him.

876
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:26,118
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually has a podcast, too.

877
00:46:26,258 --> 00:46:27,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember the name of it, but...

878
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a weird guy.

879
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:33,044
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like Mark Echoes on Crackin' French.

880
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:36,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Eccentric guy, but I was surprised with Hot Pixel.

881
00:46:36,887 --> 00:46:37,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it would suck.

882
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:45,915
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was actually kind of... It was cute in a... I don't even know how to describe it.

883
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It was...

884
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:51,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Such a weird, quirky, but in a different type of element.

885
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the game is totally just like WarioWare, but the minigames are so different.

886
00:46:57,305 --> 00:46:58,266
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I like about it.

887
00:46:58,586 --> 00:47:00,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

888
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:03,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I have another quickie for you guys.

889
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:06,353
[SPEAKER_05]: 99 Nights, I thought was great.

890
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, it's just mass murder the game.

891
00:47:11,858 --> 00:47:12,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved it.

892
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:25,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit of button mashing, but I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen and people... GamerAndy's doing a dance.

893
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:26,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the 99 Nights dance?

894
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,190
[SPEAKER_05]: GamerAndy, say hi on Orange Lounge Radio.

895
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Do a plug for your spiel and tell us about 99 Nights.

896
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:33,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, GamerAndy.

897
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:33,932
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

898
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:36,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Adam from GamerAndy Live.

899
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:37,405
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you today?

900
00:47:37,545 --> 00:47:38,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I am great!

901
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:38,967
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great!

902
00:47:39,047 --> 00:47:40,328
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of 99 Nights?

903
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:47,757
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I played it at the Spring Preview and I honestly thought it was more along the realms of the button-mashing, Dynasty Warriors-esque sort of thing.

904
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:48,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

905
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:49,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Which personally isn't really for me.

906
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:50,600
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't like it?

907
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:51,982
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no dude.

908
00:47:52,182 --> 00:47:53,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't like the cutscenes?

909
00:47:53,342 --> 00:47:55,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't like any of that stuff?

910
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:59,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the cutscenes were alright, but honestly, I really just didn't quite get into it.

911
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,465
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't my groove, dude.

912
00:48:02,665 --> 00:48:03,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to hear it.

913
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:05,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I mean, I wanted to like it, though.

914
00:48:05,706 --> 00:48:06,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

915
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:07,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Give a quick plug for your stuff.

916
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:10,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Gamer Andy Live, tonight, after these guys.

917
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:13,189
[SPEAKER_00]: After Orange Lines Radio, which rocks, by the way.

918
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:13,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo!

919
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:14,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

920
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:14,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

921
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:15,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

922
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,090
[SPEAKER_05]: He's drunk.

923
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,770
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta give the mic back to JBL.

924
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, um...

925
00:48:21,505 --> 00:48:22,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I had business.

926
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:24,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I like 99 Nights.

927
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:25,869
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit of button mashing.

928
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:28,351
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Golden Axe, but like, I don't know.

929
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:30,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what I was thinking about when I'm playing.

930
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:32,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, this is like Golden Axe, but with more.

931
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:33,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

932
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:34,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Sonic.

933
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:38,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Mortal Kombat Armageddon.

934
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anyone else play this besides me?

935
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:40,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell no.

936
00:48:40,862 --> 00:48:43,485
[SPEAKER_05]: You were a green vampire chick with an axe.

937
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Created character is always awesome in my book.

938
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:54,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though I'm a little disappointed Armageddon is only for the current gen stuff, I think created character was great.

939
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:59,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course the created character that was in there when I loaded it up was a naked woman.

940
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,241
[SPEAKER_05]: But how many of those have we seen?

941
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:03,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when I say naked, I mean, you know, bikini.

942
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:05,483
[SPEAKER_05]: But how many of those have we seen in video games?

943
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:08,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going to make a fun female character.

944
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:13,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made a green vampire bitch with a huge meat cleaver as her weapon, and it was awesome.

945
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:15,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And you won.

946
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:15,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

947
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:17,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I kicked the shit out of whoever.

948
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember what I was playing against, some Ermac or something, but it was cool.

949
00:49:22,073 --> 00:49:22,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

950
00:49:24,543 --> 00:49:45,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a little like if you have the other two Mortal Kombat games from this current generation I don't think there's a lot else here but I mean if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat I think you'll have a good time any other oh we got a call let's go to the phones and answer the phones hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio

951
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:47,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, Jason.

952
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:49,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Jason, what's up?

953
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,102
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you guys enjoying it down there?

954
00:49:52,463 --> 00:49:54,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, this is Jason, our webmaster, Jason.

955
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:57,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Jason.

956
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We miss having you here.

957
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:00,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Why I wish you were here, Jason.

958
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:00,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't you here?

959
00:50:02,074 --> 00:50:05,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not here, I'm not there because my truck demands me being here.

960
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:07,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, Jason.

961
00:50:07,855 --> 00:50:11,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And insurance and all those, you know, things that actually require money for no good reason.

962
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:13,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I hate that stuff.

963
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:15,917
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you want to call in and say to our listeners?

964
00:50:16,037 --> 00:50:22,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides the fact that you rock because you do our website stuff for us, it's a thankless job and I love you for it, you know that.

965
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,059
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you want to say to our listeners?

966
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very efficient.

967
00:50:26,778 --> 00:50:33,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about the existence of Guitar Man Live and I'm wondering if they've actually had a booth up and if you guys have got any more information on it.

968
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitaroman Live, we got into a little bit.

969
00:50:37,957 --> 00:50:41,579
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Guitaroman Lives.

970
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,341
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a port.

971
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:46,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing as the PS2.

972
00:50:46,402 --> 00:50:47,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It has duet mode.

973
00:50:48,464 --> 00:50:53,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It has some little things, but if you're looking for new songs... No, no.

974
00:50:55,528 --> 00:50:57,830
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you accidentally pause it, you can continue.

975
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,131
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to restart from the beginning.

976
00:51:00,848 --> 00:51:01,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else, Jason?

977
00:51:12,513 --> 00:51:13,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

978
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:16,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping that it was mostly a new game, especially with the duet mode.

979
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:20,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually going to further the storyline or anything along those lines.

980
00:51:20,796 --> 00:51:25,177
[SPEAKER_05]: We were a little disappointed it's not a new game either, but at least the franchise isn't dead.

981
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:26,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's the silver lining.

982
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:28,218
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they're still interested.

983
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how it does on the market.

984
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:33,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, thanks so much for calling in.

985
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, okay?

986
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:35,855
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Food Eater

987
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Poo Eater Oh, DJ Poo Eater!

988
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

989
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:09,772
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

990
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:11,053
[SPEAKER_05]: You're breaking up a little bit.

991
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:15,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your thought out there.

992
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get that out.

993
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:22,863
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Poo Eater, we're gonna have to let you go, buddy.

994
00:52:23,204 --> 00:52:26,887
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Poo Eater, we're gonna have to let you go because you're breaking up too much, but thanks for trying.

995
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:28,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe try again tomorrow.

996
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:30,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, have a good one.

997
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:34,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to another call.

998
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:35,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try a different call.

999
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:37,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they have no time.

1000
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:38,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here it is again.

1001
00:52:39,184 --> 00:52:40,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1002
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:42,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Jaded2006.

1003
00:52:43,566 --> 00:52:46,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Jaded2006, what's on your mind, buddy?

1004
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nothing much.

1005
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:50,948
[SPEAKER_08]: This is mainly a question for Bobby.

1006
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:52,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby!

1007
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:54,289
[SPEAKER_05]: A question for Bobby.

1008
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, taking over our show.

1009
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks a lot.

1010
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,091
[SPEAKER_05]: No, what's up?

1011
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,031
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the question for Bobby?

1012
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:03,061
[SPEAKER_08]: What is your honest opinion about Wii Music?

1013
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:29,698
[SPEAKER_06]: But all it was was playing the Zelda theme.

1014
00:53:30,018 --> 00:53:32,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can cue other places.

1015
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:35,860
[SPEAKER_06]: You can cue the back of the orchestra and they'll play louder.

1016
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You can slow them down and start them up, but it takes a little while to get used to it.

1017
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I only played through it twice.

1018
00:53:40,761 --> 00:53:44,362
[SPEAKER_06]: When you play that game, do you look as fruity as Miyamoto did at the conference?

1019
00:53:44,962 --> 00:53:51,149
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I actually look, I look like a real, most people do, because they're like, you know, just waving their arms and like dancing around like he did.

1020
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:58,856
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I say Miyamoto's being fruity, I tease with love, because that's why we love him, is because he's just a crazy little man.

1021
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:05,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to point out, though, you were mentioning about having a hard time actually conducting for real with it.

1022
00:54:05,705 --> 00:54:12,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I did also, when I went through there, Koji Kondo was playing, and he actually, I could tell, wasn't doing true conducting.

1023
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:12,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1024
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:22,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you have to do it like, you know, it's really rigid, and it looks like it's actually, if you know anything about conducting, it's actually the up motion is what triggers it, not the down motion.

1025
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned that right at the very end of my second thing.

1026
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, it's going on the up.

1027
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:27,150
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1028
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Jaded2006, any other thoughts for us?

1029
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:33,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it as easy as Miyamoto made it look?

1030
00:54:33,693 --> 00:54:34,253
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

1031
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:35,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1032
00:54:35,994 --> 00:54:42,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're not going to be good at it, but yeah, I mean, it's, you know, waving your arms like people who've never done music stuff were able to get through it.

1033
00:54:42,957 --> 00:54:43,437
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1034
00:54:43,557 --> 00:54:44,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does score you at the end.

1035
00:54:46,038 --> 00:54:49,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Jaded2006, we've got to let you go.

1036
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:50,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start wrapping it up, all right?

1037
00:54:51,882 --> 00:54:52,922
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thanks so much for the call.

1038
00:54:53,062 --> 00:54:54,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

1039
00:54:54,303 --> 00:54:55,363
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a good one, too.

1040
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:55,863
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1041
00:54:55,883 --> 00:54:56,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1042
00:54:56,383 --> 00:55:00,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor Spirit Snare has been trying to call in for like the past 30 minutes, and somebody else always gets in.

1043
00:55:02,085 --> 00:55:04,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've got the wrap-up sign, so we've got to start wrapping it up.

1044
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:08,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Spirit Snare, tomorrow, buddy, call in.

1045
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:08,707
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get you.

1046
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:09,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry.

1047
00:55:09,947 --> 00:55:11,648
[SPEAKER_05]: But, of course, there's always the forums.

1048
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:12,888
[SPEAKER_05]: There's LiveJournal.

1049
00:55:12,908 --> 00:55:15,929
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for anybody that wants to talk to us, but maybe is too shy to call in.

1050
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:19,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Stuff blog, stuff.orangeballonsradio.com.

1051
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,971
[SPEAKER_05]: even Myspace if you really want to.

1052
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:24,811
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got all that stuff going on, so check it out.

1053
00:55:25,432 --> 00:55:28,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, really quickly though, real quick, I had to do this before the show's over tonight.

1054
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:29,953
[SPEAKER_05]: The FUs of the week.

1055
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:34,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, give us a little bit of the... Alright.

1056
00:55:35,495 --> 00:55:35,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1057
00:55:36,035 --> 00:55:38,315
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, do you have any FUs so far at E3?

1058
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:38,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1059
00:55:40,885 --> 00:55:41,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, actually.

1060
00:55:42,186 --> 00:55:42,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1061
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:52,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've actually been pretty much okay with it, except I still think, and this actually really surprised me, my husband's actually pretty happy about it.

1062
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:59,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say F you to Capcom, because why the hell are you going to put NES Strider on the PSP?

1063
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:03,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they put NES Strider on the game?

1064
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:14,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that Capcom Classics Collection is the NES versions of Mighty Final Fight, Bionic Commando, which Dan was like, Bionic Commando!

1065
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:18,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And the NES version of Strider, which actually isn't a bad game.

1066
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:21,209
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all based off of the Strider comics.

1067
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:25,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was like, I have these at home, I can just play them at home.

1068
00:56:26,412 --> 00:56:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1069
00:56:27,232 --> 00:56:28,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I want these on my PSP?

1070
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:28,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so...

1071
00:56:29,093 --> 00:56:31,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But what about those of us who don't have those at home?

1072
00:56:32,114 --> 00:56:33,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a bad thing to have?

1073
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,915
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download it.

1074
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:38,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a bad thing to have if we don't have those games at home?

1075
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,197
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other ways to get it.

1076
00:56:40,257 --> 00:56:45,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see any reason of, you know, they should have touched it up or, you know, made it a little bit cleaner.

1077
00:56:45,379 --> 00:56:48,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is the exact port of the NES ones.

1078
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like that.

1079
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta keep the angst flowing because we gotta wrap it up.

1080
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:52,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your FU.

1081
00:56:53,482 --> 00:56:56,164
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU goes to Nintendo for a couple reasons.

1082
00:56:56,204 --> 00:57:01,087
[SPEAKER_07]: The first, because their party wasn't exactly great, even if the Black IPs were there.

1083
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:05,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And also because their booth sucks ass as far as the design goes.

1084
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:09,531
[SPEAKER_07]: and it makes it nearly impossible to play anything new that they have.

1085
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:11,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Notice I didn't talk about the Wii today.

1086
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:12,352
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because I didn't play it.

1087
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:21,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to go to the line at 12.30 and they told me tough titty because they were doing a private party which was more important.

1088
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:26,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Do your private party after hours, dummies.

1089
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, your FU.

1090
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:40,729
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU goes to three people, and one of them, his name is Scott Rubin, who was supposed to be the one that was picking me up at 8.15 in the morning at my hotel so I could get there by 9 o'clock.

1091
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,951
[SPEAKER_06]: My second, but unfortunately he...

1092
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:44,813
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1093
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,531
[SPEAKER_06]: who pulled some strings.

1094
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:06,053
[SPEAKER_06]: He was standing in the Nintendo line.

1095
00:58:06,073 --> 00:58:09,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to join him in the line and he pulled some strings and they went into the Nintendo booth.

1096
00:58:10,296 --> 00:58:17,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And my third FU goes to Lawrence Young for going with him and not waiting for me because they did the Jack Bauer time going, There's no time!

1097
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:27,149
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for Lawrence Young, the last FU is for calling me and saying, Bobby B, I'm one foot away from Madden 07.

1098
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:27,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha!

1099
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:37,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like an hour and a half away from getting in, so... I still love you, Lawrence, for whatever it's worth.

1100
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,296
[SPEAKER_05]: You edit the show so I don't have to.

1101
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:40,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you for that.

1102
00:58:40,756 --> 00:58:41,077
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1103
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:46,359
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU goes to the people that were waiting in line to see Paris Hilton.

1104
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:48,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1105

[SPEAKER_05]: Get out of my E3!

1106

[SPEAKER_05]: Get out!

1107

[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the people that need to be sterilized.

1108
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you all go sterile.

1109
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:39,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, may they never breed Alright, we gotta wrap it up Final thoughts, DarkSakura, your final thought Uh Nap Loki, your final thought My final thought is I'm gonna play Crackdown tomorrow because I forgot it was there Alright Bobby, thanks for being here again Your final thought, reject false icons Thank you I also forgot to mention, two nights in a row Superman Returns is fucking awesome and it would be a better Grand Theft Auto game
