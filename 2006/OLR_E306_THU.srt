00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are live here at the E3 Outpost for this special Thursday, E3 2006 edition.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Welcome everybody to the Thursday edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live from the E3 Outpost, celebrating all things that is E3 2006.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, say hello to my exhausted yet perky co-host, Dark Soccer, also known as Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How you doing?

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I slept on the thingy.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
On the bus? I hate L.A. traffic.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It took long enough that I could sleep.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I took proper naps.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, whatever.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Also, say hello to the one and only Tech Masoloki.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How you doing?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm good. I just ate a bunch of popcorn, chicken, and bacon out of these potatoes again.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Loving the catering at the E3 Outpost.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And then I took the bacon and dipped it in barbecue sauce.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Good people.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But that's what I can do to prove super bacon to the next level.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alright, next time. Also say hello, joining us again tonight, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yo.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How you doing, Bobby?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm tired. My feet hurt.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I am all weed out.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's probably how everybody feels about E3 today.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Also, wave hello to Mr. Lawrence Young, who is producing us tonight. He doesn't have a mic, so he can't say hi back.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But this is what he would say.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's me.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Alright, first of all, for those of you guys listening live tonight, it's about, what, 7.50, and we are supposed to be on at 6.30.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I apologize, especially to those of you guys on the East Coast.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Crap happens.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We were actually at a booth right up until 5.45.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We had an appointment at a booth, and so we actually missed the first shuttle back here to the Outpost, so we had to wait for the second one.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So I apologize.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It happens.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Technical difficulties.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Anyway, let's talk about E3 and some of the stuff we saw today.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We're going to play three interesting things.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Dark Sakura, what's one of them?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's a, I went to the games of Korea, or whatever they called it.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And apparently one of the companies is bringing out a new Kunio game in, this is 2007.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But they're basically giving rebirth to the Kunio franchise, which I thought was pretty cool.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And he seemed absolutely surprised that I would, is that a Kunio game?

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
For those who don't know what that is, was that a popular anime?

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It was brought over as River City Ransom.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, shit!

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And Dodgeball.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's all I needed to hear.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But, um, overseas it was Hot-Blooded Downtown Story and Kunio Dodgeball.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's this new game they're doing?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I didn't really tell much about it because I don't read Korean.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But it's a Kunio game.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What did it look like they were doing? Were they playing a sport? Were they beating each other up?

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They didn't show any pictures of it, it was just like the artwork for it.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was like, Kunio game! I mean, I don't care, it's Kunio.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The same guy who I surprised was also surprised that I played Ragnarok Online.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He was apparently one of the people who worked on it.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, very cool.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was like, hey, you're my hero. You have created my addiction.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you want to talk to Dark Soccer about Kunio, you can join our chat room.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's chat.allgames.com for tonight.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But everything is actually filtered through Bobby tonight.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because I left the Eyebyuk at home. I call it the Eyebyuk after Bjork because I love her.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I have my Eyebyuk back at the hotel.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So Dark Sakura and Loki and myself have no way of seeing chat, only Bobby.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So be nice to me.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can see from here and I can, like, laugh at people.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We will take calls a little later on in the program, but if you're calling in right now, too bad. We're playing a game.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Just to say something to Fantas.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I've been looking for Gravity every year, so I can ask him where's Ragnarok Online 2.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Wasn't Ragnarok Online 2 supposed to be, like, last year's E3?

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have no idea. Gravity never shows up.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They're too busy banning people.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There is actually a Wikipedia article up for Ragnarok Online 2 that has some of the features from previous information that's been leaked.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So maybe you can find something there. I don't know.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I have a site for it, but it's a placeholder.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Again, for those of you guys who are listening to us and going, God, those guys don't sound normal.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, that's because we're at the E3 Outpost and you get that nice ambient.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The little club going on in the background.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Who's DJing down there?

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Who's pretty funky?

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Lawrence is shaking his head.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can probably check my flyer.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's get his card after the show.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Alright.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Loki, what was something you saw today? We heard about Korean Kunio.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's something interesting you saw today, Loki?

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, something a bit more normal, I guess.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We actually went and saw the Gears of War demonstration, and that was pretty sexy, actually.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I totally dig the way Microsoft has their theater set up.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's the way you do it right there.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, the way Microsoft had their theater for Gears of War is that you actually went in and you would put these headphones on so that all the outside noise is blocked.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But you can hear the Gears of War stuff clearly, and that way you're not blasting the whole booth full of noise.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And then there's also surround sound in the floor, so when the guns went off, it vibrated your butt.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's exactly how theirs was last year.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So if you want a free butt massage at E3, go check out the Gears of War demo.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No, what did you think of the game itself, though, Gears of War?

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I thought it looked awesome.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm not really into a lot of first-person shooters, but it looked pretty solid.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I haven't seen the Halo trailer yet, but I would say it probably looks better than Halo.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't do a lot of first-person shooters either. I do do Halo. I think Halo's awesome.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But Gears of War, what I liked about it is that it looked like it was really dummy-fied, like a lot of one-button stuff.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Because basically the developer or whoever was showing it to us went through the game twice.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The first time they went through the first level and just jammed through it.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They just jammed through the level, and I was like, wow, that guy's doing a lot of shit. I'll never be able to recreate it.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But then the second time, he went back through the game and showed how easy it was to be hacking people with chainsaws and all the cool stuff he was doing.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a very violent game.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Very violent. Very, very pretty, though.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, and the only minor, minor bench I have is that there were some frame rate problems.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But I'm hoping...

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think that's just the video.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, it's just a develop or whatever it is issue, and that'll be gone by the time it actually rolls out.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
For those of you guys that are into Halo, the fact that this thing has multiplayer, this is going to be your holdover for Halo 3.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it might even be a real good, right up their competitor with Halo 3, like Half-Life, Quake, one of those.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It might actually be coming around around the same time as Halo 3.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No, they said 2006, so we're holding them to that.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, Halo's supposed to be in 2006 also.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't believe it. I say Halo 3 not until next year.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, they said otherwise.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't give a crap what they say. It's not true.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They would have shown playable footage at E3 if it was true.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Good point.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Bobby!

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hi.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Three interesting things. What's one of them?

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, I kind of spent all day in one place, so it's kind of hard.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, you've got to have seen at least three demos while you were there. Where did you spend your whole day?

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I spent my whole day playing with my Wii and Nintendo.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You guys suck with your booth design, making me wait in line for two hours so I could sit in other lines watching people play 20-minute demos.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So if there's four people in front of you, that's an hour just to play one game.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I hate Nintendo's booth this year. I absolutely hate it. I'm not talking about the games in it.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The booth? I hate it. It is horrible compared to the past two years.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's atrocious. I could just...

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We're going to do FUs of the Week later.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, cool. Did we bring One Wiggin' Angel?

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No, I didn't bring it. You're going to sing it.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, no, later. All right.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But I did get to play a lot with the Wii, and I'll pretty much start.

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The first thing that I'll talk about here is probably the tech demos and some of the stuff that they're doing.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to help you here. What was the first thing you went for?

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because you get in there, there's what, 20 games in there. You must have went right to something.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Wii Orchestra.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why did you pick Wii Orchestra?

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Because it was the first one in the little thing to go in.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Were you just like, you're going to go in there like, I'm going to go around each and every one of these things?

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It wasn't quite set up like that. You had to get past this row of little mini living rooms.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And then you got to the demos.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, see, Wii Orchestra was in the living rooms.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It was like the least packed living room.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I'm a music person.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I did it, and for those, since you guys don't, you know,

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
here in Orange County, you guys don't really know some of my background,

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I actually play symphonic percussion.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I am in two wind symphonies in the Atlanta area.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I know how to conduct, because I have conducted before.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But you got to realize, and what I was trying to see is, you know,

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I know Dance Dance Revolution is not a dancing simulator.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can't learn how to play guitar with Guitar Hero.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can't conduct with Wii Orchestra.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It was very hard. I was trying to, you know, use real conducting techniques,

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and it's not that good yet.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You do have to treat it like a video game.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But it was interesting.

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What did you learn about the Wii controller today?

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That I learned the tech specs of it.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And what are the tech specs of the Wiimote?

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't care what, I'm calling this the Wiimote.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Wiicon.

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Dark Sakura says Wiicon, I say Wiimote.

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So we're just always going to have this back and forth

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
until Miyamoto can clear this up.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So, and by the way, Funny Dale, final for long,

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
was right at the very end of the booth, right before you.

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Anyway, here's the thing.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Nintendo kept saying, oh, you know, making you think

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that it was kind of like a 3D mouse.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It would be able to tell where it was in 3D space.

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You know, you'd be able to put the controller on the floor,

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and know it was on the floor.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, it's not like that.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's accelerometers and an IR infrared blaster,

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
just like your TV's remote control.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So a lot of things, like, people were saying,

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
oh, it's so sensitive, you know,

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
when they were playing, like, the Duck Hunt thing.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's an IR, and the receiver is that little sensor

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that has double-stick tape that you put under your TV.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So the farther away you are from your TV,

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the less sensitive it is.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's how you fix the sensitivity.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Since we were two feet away from the screen,

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
it was very, very, very sensitive.

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, also, the thing is, they're going to be adjusting

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the sensitivity, and you're going to have an adjustment

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
very similar to, like, a calibrating a mouse sensitivity.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right, but I mean, what I'm saying is, like,

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
we could, like, step back another foot,

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and that would adjust the sensitivity as well.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And they're not telling people that.

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They're trying to say it's some, like, revolutionary technology.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Tell me more about the sensor.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You said it's just a little piece of tape, practically?

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, it's a little piece, well, no, it's not really tape.

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's got double-stick tape.

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's how it attaches to your TV.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But you can put it on a table as long, you know,

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
because some people were asking, you know,

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
okay, I have a projector, and I project on my wall.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And they're like, well, you know, you should mount it to the wall

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
underneath where your screen is or something and stuff.

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But it's not used in every game.

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Only in the games that actually use the IR sensor,

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
which Excite Truck is not one of.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That only used the accelerometers in it.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Very interesting.

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, you know, some games don't even need that sensor.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can take that sensor away and still play Excite Truck.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
All right.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's very interesting.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I think Bobby's going to win round one of three interesting things,

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because that was very interesting.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
All right.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, here's mine.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
My interesting thing I saw was Luminous 2.

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I went and saw Luminous 2, which was being shown at one of Mr. Games.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know why Luminous 2 is interesting?

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't see any damn difference from Luminous 1.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Not a damn thing was different from Luminous 1.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay, some of the themes were different,

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and it seemed to have more video in the background,

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and they changed the look.

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was surprised, because Luminous Live on Xbox looks a lot like Luminous 2.

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
As for new modes, whatever else, it wasn't in the demo,

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
so I couldn't tell you, and nobody at the booth told me anything extra.

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So as far as I know, if you have Luminous,

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
there's really no need to get Luminous 2.

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I imagine they'll announce other things later,

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
but they're not in the demo.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I started the demo from scratch.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It takes you right in the game.

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
In fact, some of the music was the same.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, some of the music and themes were the exact same.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Not a good demo in my opinion.

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was very disappointed in Luminous 2.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
However, the surprise of Luminous on Xbox Live,

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
which I actually played today,

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
complete with the Madonna video and everything,

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
was a great experience, because it's nice to play it on a huge TV and all that stuff.

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So that's one of mine.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Dark Sakura, you got a second interesting thing for us?

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Star Trek Legacy.

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Ah, yes. Now this is the show that made us late.

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, we had a meeting with Bethesda to see their demo for that.

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That was pretty sick.

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You basically can pick from any generation of the Star Trek universe,

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
with the exception of, I think, Enterprise.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No, Enterprise is in there all five generations.

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, Enterprise was not there.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
As in the series Enterprise.

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, the series Enterprise, not the ship.

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, according to the trailer that they had, it included Enterprise.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They didn't show it in the demo.

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
According to them, they had original series,

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
they had Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That was it.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Well, not according to their trailer.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, I feel like I'm in the movie Trekkies right now. What else?

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, according to their rep, that's what I said.

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Alright.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Anyway, you can also play as Romulans, you can play as Klingons,

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you can play as the Borg, which I thought was pretty cool.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And you can assimilate people.

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's cool.

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Only in the multiplayer.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Only multiplayer.

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The single player is all...

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's all Federation.

281
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, Federation.

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It was, they actually, on the demo, they recreated the battle from The Wrath of Khan.

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That was pretty awesome.

284
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This game is a Trekkies wet dream.

285
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, yeah.

286
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They went all out.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
They have everything nailed down, like the ship specs, the, you know,

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
like you say, the recreation of certain scenarios.

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And, you know, if you're into Star Trek, you're gonna think it's great.

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And...

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You have full range of motion in that game.

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
On top of that, if you are a little bit iffy on direction,

293
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
you can even go to a strategic map mode, select where you want to go,

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and it'll just go there.

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You can even play the whole game in strategic map mode,

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
but it's a little eh.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's like more for, okay, I want to go here, and then I'm gonna fight.

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's definitely a tactical ship game, too.

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I actually thought when we were going in there,

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I thought we were gonna see the Star Trek MMO,

301
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
which is nowhere to be seen.

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I guess it's still in early development.

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But I was, I'm a casual Trekkie.

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Like, I like Star Trek.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's cool.

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't like it now that it's on G4, but I'll watch it other places.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But it's a good show.

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You know, it's fun.

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And a lot of, you know, high school memories and stuff.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But it's definitely complete, like, very complete for the Star Trek hardcore fan.

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I mean, they went to all these resources.

312
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And even for the casual Trek fan,

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
it's gonna have tutorial modes that ease you into it

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and easy scenarios type situations.

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And it's very pretty to look at.

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I mean, it's a pretty, pretty game.

317
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So I was very impressed with Star Trek Legacy.

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thumbs up.

319
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
All right.

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Loki, one interesting thing.

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I got to play more of the PlayStation 2 today.

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The interesting part...

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why don't you come over to my house and play PlayStation 2?

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You mean PlayStation 3?

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
PlayStation 3.

327
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I played both today.

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
All right.

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I got it only.

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No, PlayStation 3 actually played two different games.

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And here's the thing.

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The surprising thing is I'm not impressed by the PlayStation 3 at all.

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I played one of the games I've been looking forward to

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
ever since I saw the video MotorStorm.

335
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What the hell?

336
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean, it's completely...

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's just an average game.

338
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So what?

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, goody.

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You got the mud effects right.

341
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Doesn't make it any better of an off-road game.

342
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay.

343
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What did you like about the movie that you saw?

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What I liked about the movie,

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
the movie made it seem like it's gonna be burnout off-road type of thing.

346
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Really fast, really crazy-ass gameplay

347
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
where cars are just crashing and flipping all over the place and exploding.

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Fire, just lots of stuff like that.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And what was the reality of the demo?

350
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The reality of the demo was it was just an off-road game.

351
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Cars seemed to be driving extremely slow.

352
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In fact, a lot of times you'd fall off a cliff or whatever.

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you did happen to crash, it would do a slow-mo instant replay of it,

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and it was very unimpressive.

355
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Especially for a next-gen game, I see better crashes and burnout.

356
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And I'm talking about, you know, even I think before burnout,

357
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
it's really sad.

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Burnout PlayStation 2 has better crashes than this game.

359
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What else did you check out on PlayStation 3?

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I checked out Gran Turismo HD and also not impressed by it at all.

361
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
With the paper people?

362
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, the paper people.

363
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They're back.

364
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In high def.

365
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's not necessarily the paper people.

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They're actually kind of 3D, but they don't move.

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They're just kind of stationary.

368
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In the Grand Canyon level, they do move.

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, a little bit.

370
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But here's the thing.

371
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If you drive past them, they're still looking behind you down the track

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
like something's going to happen.

373
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, let's give them a break, though.

374
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's an early, early build.

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That all might still change, you know?

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's pretty.

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll give it that.

378
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
They're not the only game that uses paper people.

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I mean, let's look at MotoGP 2006.

380
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I played that today also.

381
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Same problem.

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The whole thing is it's not impressive enough to get me to spend more money.

383
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This thing has got to be leaps and bounds better than the 360

384
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
in order for me to spend that kind of money.

385
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm really not seeing anything really unique and revolutionary

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
coming out for anything on the PlayStation 3.

387
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's all just more of the same crap, just prettier.

388
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I did notice, though, that Sonic the Hedgehog

389
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and there's a few other games, I think, that were on both platforms

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
looked a little better on the PlayStation 3.

391
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The Sonic looked a little bit better.

392
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Was it Mobile Suit Gundam looked extremely better than the 360 version?

393
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't know if it's the monitors that they're playing on,

394
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
but it looked like night and day for that.

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Pretty graphics can't make me forgive the botch job done on Sonic.

396
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
All right, Bobby, how's Chat Room doing?

397
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They're doing fine.

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They're pitching about G4 right now, actually.

399
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They're asking if we went by G4's booth and what was going on.

400
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I have avoided it at all costs.

401
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I heard a bunch of monkeys outside the booth today going,

402
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ah! Oh, my God!

403
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And just didn't care.

404
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What were they cheering for?

405
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Attack of the Show, I think, was live from E3.

406
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hi, Mom, I'm on TV.

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, Kevin Pereira, what the fuck you did?

408
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Ah, love you, ah!

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, pretty much.

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah, no, not for me.

411
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I kept running into them today.

412
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They had booth babes doing weird things.

413
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Now, you brought this up when we were walking around

414
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that there was not a swarm of G4 people like there was in years past.

415
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's because they're not a gaming channel again.

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, right, I know. They're off getting guys.

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah.

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Did they get you?

419
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No, that's their slogan. We get guys.

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They're off getting guys.

421
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's why I'm asking you. Did they get you?

422
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Uh-huh.

423
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Did they get you?

424
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No.

425
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay, good.

426
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No, they don't have me.

427
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I hid from them.

428
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Here's the thing, though.

429
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're not a guy.

430
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I see swarms of GameTap shirts, which is okay because I like GameTap.

431
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Right.

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But I was surprised at that.

433
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't think they're working for GameTap.

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Was GameTap giving away something to shirt holders?

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
They were giving away shirts.

436
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I missed that one out.

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, yeah, but you don't wear your shirts that you win the next day.

438
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The shirts I get...

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Some people...

440
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Some people...

441
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, okay.

442
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Look at that right here.

443
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Sorry.

444
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He's a freak.

445
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay.

446
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The shirts I get at E3, I wear to the gym, which isn't very often,

447
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
but that's where they get used.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's my wardrobe is all my E3 shirts, and I haven't gotten a single one this year.

449
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I know.

450
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So I'm going to be naked next week, and I'm a fat man, so that's not a good thing.

451
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Cheap.

452
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Cheap.

453
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No, very disappointing swag this year.

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You know why?

455
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Everybody's shit is online.

456
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, I don't know.

457
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I pretty much hoard myself out to Namco for tokens.

458
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay, but you may have gotten some shit, and I've gotten some closer.

459
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I have slime keychains.

460
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But is it as good as it was two years ago with the swag?

461
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I say no.

462
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No.

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
No.

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No.

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But I got slime keychains.

466
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The swag goes down every year.

467
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This is my tenth E3, and I have actually noticed every single year I get less and less and

468
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
less swag.

469
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It goes down every year.

470
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Because they're getting cheap.

471
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yep.

472
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Everything's awesome.

473
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I got a clock from the Korean people.

474
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Pretty soon E3 is going to be online.

475
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's fine, though, because I hate traffic here.

476
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I wish they'd moved E3 to Vegas or somewhere that's built to hold a convention.

477
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think they should bring it back to Atlanta.

478
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I loved it when it was in Atlanta.

479
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, but you have selfish reasons for that.

480
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I actually wouldn't mind going to Atlanta.

481
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I wouldn't mind either.

482
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sure it's a great place.

483
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because then I can go to E3 and drive back to Mobile and hang out with my family and

484
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
then play home.

485
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't think you're right.

486
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Dear ESA, please have E3 in Mr. Blackwell's backyard.

487
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

488
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
All right.

489
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Speaking of Bobby, one interesting thing.

490
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Another one.

491
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Number two.

492
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah, another one.

493
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
One thing, since more Wii, since apparently I played the Wii all day today.

494
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You played with your Wii all day long.

495
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I played with my Wii.

496
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And here's the thing.

497
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
A lot of people are actually wondering about, and this is more about the IR games.

498
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
They're like, oh, my arm's going to get tired when I play these games all that much.

499
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Your arm gets tired after you play with your Wii too long.

500
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Exactly.

501
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay.

502
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Well, there is a way to play with your Wii without moving your arm.

503
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You really only need very...

504
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was holding the controller in the same position that I would hold a PS2 controller.

505
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Because I've been doing very slight movements with my wrist, so you don't have to worry about every single game making you do sweeping motions.

506
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Now, yes, WarioWare does make you do hula hoops and squats and stuff like that.

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But not all the games are going to really tire you out.

508
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And so I thought that was kind of interesting, you know, how natural I could actually be laying on the couch and playing some of these games.

509
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think there actually need to be more games that wear people out.

510
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, WarioWare's a good start.

511
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And then maybe that horse racing game...

512
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Final Furlong?

513
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Dark Sakura wants Wii Torture Chamber.

514
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
No, I don't want Wii Torture Chamber.

515
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I want, like, Wii Robics and, like, Wii Boot Camp.

516
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Wii Boot Camp sounds better.

517
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Wii Boot Camp.

518
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because I think about Dance Aerobics and, like...

519
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They can fully bring back Dance Aerobics on the Wii.

520
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No.

521
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Wii!

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Hook up a DDR mat and then have the controller.

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There you go.

524
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, that's pretty much the same thing with the eye toy and...

525
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's something...

526
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, but this is by Nintendo, so it'll be better.

527
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So it'll be awesome.

528
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You know it and I know it.

529
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If they brought out a new Dance Aerobics, you'd play it once and that would be it.

530
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No.

531
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's me.

532
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I wouldn't.

533
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Anyway.

534
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
My second interesting thing I saw today would be the...

535
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Eye of Judgment.

536
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Did you make your judgment on it?

537
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I did make a judgment on it.

538
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What a waste of fucking space at the PlayStation 3 booth.

539
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What a waste of fucking space.

540
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I'm sorry to the guys that developed this because I'm sure they worked very hard on

541
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
this, but now is not the time to be showing me the Eye of Judgment.

542
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The Eye of Judgment could have been done on the PS2.

543
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I...

544
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
From my perspective...

545
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Now, granted, I don't know any tech stuff about PS3.

546
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The Eye of Judgment...

547
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
For those that don't know what the Eye of Judgment is, it's that thing they showed at

548
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
the conference where you put the card down and whoosh, a monster comes onto the screen.

549
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It looked like Yu-Gi-Oh.

550
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I guess it's supposed to be a game, but the people admitted that it wasn't really a game

551
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
but more like a tech demo.

552
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't know.

553
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Loki, you saw the Eye of Judgment.

554
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What was your thoughts?

555
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, here's the thing.

556
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
When basically you have to put down a card and the eye toy, or it wasn't really an eye

557
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
toy, it was just a camera, would recognize these barcode light things on top and bottom

558
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
of the card, and there's also like four triangles on it to kind of orient the card so it knows

559
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
which direction it's facing because that's important.

560
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So, basically, it will spawn whatever monster based on what card it is.

561
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Now, here's the thing that really kind of bugged me about it.

562
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You can cast spells on your monsters as well, but the spell card is put on top of the monster

563
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
card, and you have to remember to take the card off after the spell is cast, otherwise

564
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it casts again because it's stupid.

565
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And also, if you're playing the game and happen to destroy a monster, you have to remember

566
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
to take it off the board, otherwise it spawns the monster again because it's stupid.

567
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah, the Eye of Judgment has an IQ of about three.

568
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Here's the other thing that the geniuses...

569
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
They need a brain of judgment.

570
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Here's the geniuses that Sony didn't think about.

571
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay, this game uses actual cards like magic cards or something like that.

572
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, if you're actually going to be playing this game, they're playing on selling expansion

573
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
packs later on.

574
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Here's the only problem here.

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You can probably scan those cards and print them back out again, and there you go.

576
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You have two cards because the camera's not going to know the difference between a fake

577
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and a real card.

578
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay, Bobby, who are those Cats and Ken show we saw the first day that are here tonight?

579
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Novint Falcon.

580
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay, Novint.

581
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
N-O-V-I-N-T.

582
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Describe Novint for the listeners real quick, and there's a reason I'm doing this.

583
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Okay, Novint Falcon, basically what it is, it's a PC peripheral, and it takes USB, and

584
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
essentially it has touch sensitive, so it's a little ball, and I will link it in chat

585
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
because I've got to go find it on Google, and I'll put the link in chat.

586
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I think it's novint.com slash falcon.htm or something like that.

587
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And you put your fingers on this little ball, and say there is a ball on the screen.

588
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You actually push forward, and it will stop at the ball, and you can actually trace around

589
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the ball, and then if they have ridges on it, you can actually feel the ridges as you

590
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
touch the ball, or like, if you have like balls, you can have a rubber band, and it

591
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
will actually pull you around.

592
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You can feel your balls, like they're right there in your hand.

593
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So we have gone from the Wii to the balls.

594
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Alright, no, but seriously though, okay.

595
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Explicit tag, here we come.

596
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
These are all, yeah, I think we have to explicit this show.

597
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Um, look, um, the point is that these are all tech demos, but this, they also have,

598
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
what was it, Half-Life they were showing?

599
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
They had Half-Life 2 and something else, and they are here tonight.

600
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, now here's the thing.

601
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That, I went and played that, and I thought, this is great.

602
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Why isn't this on a console?

603
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
That is what Sony should be having in their little rooms right now.

604
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The Eye of Judgment is, it is not time for the Eye of Judgment, okay.

605
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That, I would have been far more impressed if Sony had teamed up with those Novant guys

606
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and were showing that thing.

607
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's not a smart name to be calling that either, the Eye of Judgment.

608
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I judge this crap.

609
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
All right.

610
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It is Novant.com slash Falcon dot HTML.

611
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
All right, we gotta keep things moving.

612
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
If you guys are listening live, gamer Andy will be out momentarily.

613
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm looking right at him, he's sitting there.

614
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Hi, gamer Andy, how you doing?

615
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Uh, and we're starting to butt into his time a little bit.

616
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

617
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Okay, good.

618
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, I see him chowing down on a sandwich, so I'll wait till he's finished.

619
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Then we'll get out of here.

620
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They spent an hour and a half in L.A. traffic.

621
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, well, poor bastards.

622
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
All right, so, yeah, those of you guys listening live, you'll hear him next,

623
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
but if you miss it for whatever reason,

624
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
they've got their podcast over at gamerandy.com.

625
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Check it out, it's rad.

626
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
All right, one other thing you thought was interesting today, Dark Sakura.

627
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on PSP.

628
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It was purdy.

629
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Now, this is not the same as the Capcom Classics thing

630
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that also has Ghosts and Goblins, right?

631
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This is an all-new Ghosts and Goblins game.

632
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What's so funky new about it?

633
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You don't get golden armor, you get, like, blue pimp armor or something.

634
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And, like, one of the enemies in the new one is these hands

635
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that reach out of the ground and grab you

636
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and then, like, throw you into a vat of acid

637
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
or, like, bang you into the ground.

638
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And, like, the spitting plants were still there.

639
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The little ghosty things were still there.

640
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I didn't see the vampire in a box from the old ones.

641
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You could still shoot the vases.

642
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
They're still there. Or urns, I guess, are more accurate.

643
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I did go on one of the bosses.

644
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
There's actually new weapons.

645
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And you have a refillable life bar.

646
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But when that's out, then you turn into the, you know, naked guy.

647
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh, that's cool.

648
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That seems to help the difficulty a little bit, I think.

649
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I actually avoided them at first because I thought they were the holy water

650
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and the holy water sucks.

651
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
One of your weapons is a crossbow.

652
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You also have little bombs.

653
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You can get, you know, you start off with the lances, of course,

654
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
which I still think are the better weapons.

655
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You also get, like, a vine whip, which really sucks ass.

656
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Another cool thing about that that just made me laugh,

657
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I actually took a little bit of video of this, sort of stealthily,

658
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
is one of the cursed forms that he can get is as a woman.

659
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Which I would think that would be a blessing.

660
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
What a curse indeed.

661
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Hey, hey, it actually made the boss fight better because she is, like,

662
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
in this big, she looks very peasant German, you know,

663
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
like you see in the old history books, in a big dress.

664
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And she'd sort of float in the air, sort of like Princess Peach,

665
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
which was cool because you could still attack.

666
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
She would just move slower, like a really huge woman.

667
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But you throw attacks while you're floating in the air

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and you can still hit the boss.

669
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It actually ended up being more convenient,

670
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
but of course when you get hit, you lose the form again.

671
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But I enjoyed it immensely. The music was still good.

672
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It was also right next to Tekken, so I was going between the two for a while.

673
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But, you know, I actually wasn't too sure about it at first

674
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
until I talked to Dan on the phone yesterday.

675
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He's like, you were going to go play Ultimate Ghost of Goblins.

676
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I was like, okay. So I did and I had a good time.

677
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It was pretty fun.

678
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I was when I was hanging out with Julie, custom E19,

679
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
who she was over there playing Ace Combat.

680
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
She's like, I don't like this game.

681
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I was like, go play Ghost of Goblins.

682
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
She's like, no. But no, it was great. It was fantastic.

683
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Loki.

684
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Actually the surprising game that I saw today was this game

685
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that probably from a company no one's ever heard of.

686
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's actually by this group called On Games,

687
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and the game was called Wild Summer.

688
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now, basically this game is like a sandbox game,

689
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
very similar to Granth and Auto,

690
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
but it's basically like kind of a plot line to American Pie.

691
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You're this trouble-starting teenager with hormones raging.

692
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Loki, tell them why we went to look at this game.

693
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Because I saw the game and I'm like, ooh, I got to go play that

694
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
because it looked like Leisure Suit Larry.

695
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, I know I saw the poster and it showed this teenage boy

696
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that was stealing panties off a clothes line,

697
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and I was like, I have to see whatever that fucking game is.

698
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That looks too unreal to be true.

699
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So anyways, it looks amazing so far.

700
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They still have about a year and a half of development left

701
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that's supposed to be coming out in fall of 2007.

702
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But the thing is, it's going to be,

703
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
they've got like a ton of different stuff in here.

704
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
One of the things that they were showing was the kind of,

705
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
oh, what was it, like the free-running type of stuff in there.

706
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So you're jumping from buildings and stuff.

707
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You kind of have the same Prince of Persia gameplay.

708
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It also has a bunch of mini-games, including like dancing,

709
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
playing beach volleyball.

710
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But they have a dating part in it too, kind of like a dating sim.

711
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And the way the dating sim is, it's going to be playing Magic the Gathering.

712
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You're actually going to have like cards for, you know,

713
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
pretend you're interested in their conversation, you know,

714
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
get her drunk, stuff like that.

715
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It's a very ambitious game.

716
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It sounds like there's a lot they want to do with it.

717
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But I was really impressed with the guy,

718
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and they were very nice to us too.

719
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It looked like they've gone into a lot of detail.

720
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They've really thought out about what they want to do,

721
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
like what their dream game is, and they're going and doing it.

722
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And I asked this question, and Jamie, you might appreciate this.

723
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I don't know.

724
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I said, why would a woman ever want to play this game?

725
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Essentially, I said, what is in this for a woman?

726
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And basically what they said is that we have women on staff

727
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
helping us write this game.

728
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We're not out to make a tacky game.

729
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Leisure Suit Larry is now a tacky franchise now.

730
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We're out to make a fun game, you know.

731
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's why there's no nudity in this game.

732
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Sorry, guys.

733
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There's no nudity.

734
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
There's no, like it's not perverted.

735
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's just silly fun, like the American Pie or Porky's movies,

736
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
those types of things.

737
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's just a little bit of dumb fun.

738
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So they think that women might want to play it just because it's silly.

739
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's not meant to be a serious game.

740
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That was interesting.

741
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm not interested.

742
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Really?

743
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Take a look.

744
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I walked by it.

745
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
No, I was over there.

746
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm not interested.

747
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What turned you on?

748
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I don't see what fun it is to play a hormonal 16-year-old.

749
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, you haven't been a hormonal 16-year-old boy.

750
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Exactly.

751
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I have no interest in it.

752
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
There's nothing that links it to me.

753
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I was spending my 16-year-old kicking off the horny 16-year-old boys.

754
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's all right.

755
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
They still have Desperate Housewives out there.

756
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You know what?

757
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Shut up.

758
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Desperate Housewives will teach you how to cook and gossip.

759
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I was surprised.

760
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
They actually go into extreme detail on cooking in that game.

761
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, it's like you can pick from recipes and all this crap.

762
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't need a video game to teach me how to cook.

763
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I am so glad I'm on the edge of this stage so I can just run down the stairs as quick

764
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
as possible.

765
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We've done this for years.

766
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And one of these days, I'm going to combust, and you'll be right next to me.

767
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I was actually surprised at how thorough the Desperate Housewives game looked to be.

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I was actually kind of surprised.

769
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It's a really intricate game, but it's stupid.

770
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's a great game, but it's stupid.

771
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's intricate, but it's stupid.

772
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Intricately stupid.

773
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah.

774
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What a waste.

775
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What a waste.

776
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But Wild Summer, you know what?

777
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I think it'll be cute.

778
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I want to see it.

779
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
They're working on getting it on the 360.

780
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And to be honest, there's nothing like it out there, especially on the 360.

781
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And they had other games, too, that looked pretty good.

782
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
All right.

783
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We've got to keep it moving, guys.

784
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Bobby, one more interesting thing from today.

785
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Going for the Wii trifecta because I just can't stop talking about my Wii.

786
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, wouldn't that be a Triforce?

787
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Bobby, a Triforce.

788
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh, wow.

789
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We'll be here till Friday.

790
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Thank you.

791
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The virtual console, they actually had two demo units running of the virtual console

792
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
with that new controller that they were showing that looks like a Super Nintendo controller

793
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
with dual analog sticks.

794
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Cool.

795
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And it's a very light controller, very comfortable to me.

796
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
They had five games running.

797
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
They had one for each system, pretty much.

798
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They had Super Mario Brothers on the NES, Super Mario World on the SNES,

799
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Super Mario 64 on the N64, Sonic the Hedgehog on Genesis,

800
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and Bonk's Adventure on the TurboGrafx.

801
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Did they show anything about how the games would be bought or anything,

802
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
or was it just title screen go?

803
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just title screen go.

804
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's kind of lame.

805
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And Super Mario 64 has some frame rate issues.

806
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Ouch.

807
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And it's hard to control with that controller.

808
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Well, the whole thing, too, is the virtual console wasn't a finished product either.

809
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
This is a concept right now.

810
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They haven't even worked out the details.

811
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes, the SNES and the Genesis games worked really well.

812
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I mean, it felt good.

813
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Then I'll back off.

814
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The thing is, though, I haven't played a TurboGrafx in so long.

815
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I believe that Bonk's worked really well.

816
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I mean, it looked fine to me.

817
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I didn't notice any glitches or anything,

818
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
but I can't compare it to the original TurboGrafx.

819
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Did it tell you to press run?

820
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I didn't look.

821
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I did love how sharp the games looked.

822
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah.

823
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It was so high res.

824
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I mean, it's pillar boxed, but it's still high.

825
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah.

826
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's still pixelated.

827
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Maybe they up-coded it somehow or something.

828
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah, they had to up-convert it probably to 480p.

829
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Well, that's cool.

830
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Hey, hats off there.

831
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Actually, I saw Super Mario World yesterday.

832
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I thought it looked really clean.

833
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Awesome.

834
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
All right.

835
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Chat room question from a while ago.

836
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, yes, please.

837
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm sorry.

838
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Sorry, chat room again.

839
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't have the iBUCS, so we can't look at chat.

840
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Jamie and I.

841
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But Bobby, what's chat room say?

842
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
CKY Mike, who thinks I should join you guys full-time, asked what game...

843
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You want to move to Sacramento, then we'll talk.

844
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, I'll move to Sacramento.

845
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
All right.

846
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How about that?

847
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
All right.

848
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
What game demos did you get to download at the PSP booth?

849
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I believe that's a Matt thing.

850
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's a Loki thing.

851
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Go for it.

852
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, let's see.

853
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They have the Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, I guess is what it's called now, and they

854
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
only really had one stage from that, and that was actually Ghosts and Goblins, I guess.

855
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Then they had, let's see, Gangs of London was one of them.

856
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
They had Lemmings.

857
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The one I played, Every Extended Extra.

858
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, Every Extended Extra.

859
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
E3.

860
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And that was okay.

861
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
They had Ratchet and Clank, Size Matters.

862
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I played that for a little bit.

863
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That was okay.

864
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then I can't remember the last game was.

865
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It wasn't that standout.

866
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Every Extended Extra seemed okay to me.

867
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It was weird.

868
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It was a little weird.

869
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It wasn't what I expected from Q Entertainment, but I think it'll be a good time.

870
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I like how they re-stamped or reused some of the sound effects from Luminous.

871
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah, that was funny.

872
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Dark Star?

873
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
No, I have an honorable mention.

874
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay, yeah, let's do real quick though.

875
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
We want to try and start wrapping this up.

876
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We are going to take a couple quick phone calls though.

877
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Bobby, tell them how to get in.

878
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Okay, you can call 1-866-880-0156.

879
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Soul-free number in the United States.

880
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Some quickies first.

881
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Dark Sakura.

882
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
WTF.

883
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The WTF game is amazing.

884
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I chopped rabbits in half.

885
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It was great.

886
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I did the wood chopping game.

887
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It basically is a bunch of really, really messed up mini games.

888
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And the ones that Julie and I actually played was the wood chopping game

889
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
where you chop wood for money.

890
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Only the thing is that the grandma lady will randomly put out an animal.

891
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The chicken sorting game was fantastic because you could do.

892
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You sort them as boys, girls, or dead.

893
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
No, it said heavenly.

894
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Because they're dead.

895
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
That's why they go to heaven.

896
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But that's great.

897
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And that made me go WTF.

898
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's a great time.

899
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
All right, we've got to go.

900
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It was work time fun.

901
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Let's go to the telephone.

902
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

903
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Who's this?

904
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Hi, it's Sephiroth1215.

905
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

906
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We've got to make it quick tonight.

907
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Okay, I was going to say there has been a little bit of an update for the Imani booth.

908
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah, there's been a little bit.

909
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It said on Imani style that they brought Guitar Freaks, of course the response to Guitar Hero.

910
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
UDX is there to show the press how cool the game would potentially be.

911
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And when they asked about another Beat Mania game for US,

912
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
it said that it was too early for them to say whether or not it did well or not.

913
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I did not hear, you said Guitar Freaks broke?

914
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
No, Guitar Freaks was a response to Guitar Hero.

915
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I think that they had Guitar Freaks and the Imani in there to have people come over to their booth.

916
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That was it.

917
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I think it was a press attention thing showing, I think they wanted to show, look at our arcade machines.

918
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Look at, we are bringing the arcade experience home.

919
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But the weird thing about that, I don't understand the logic of Guitar Freaks being there.

920
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I still don't, but maybe they want to show, hey, we've been doing this in the arcade for a long time.

921
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm not one to say why they have that there, if it is a response to Guitar Hero.

922
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Or maybe they're like me and seeing how non-innovative Guitar Hero is because it's been out forever in Japan as Guitar Freaks.

923
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
See, but I disagree because I do think Guitar Hero is innovative, but in a different way than you do.

924
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Or you don't, I should say.

925
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And what was the other part of that you said that they were reporting, Sephiroth?

926
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:55,000
They said that 2DX was there because they wanted to show the press how cool it would be and the potential that it could have.

927
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Nothing wrong with a little attention, right?

928
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Well, yeah. But the problem with that is they did say that they don't have any plans for another US sequel because they don't know whether or not it's sold well enough.

929
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Now, the problem I have with that is if I look back on DDR, I mean, they went on for a while and probably didn't sell well until maybe at least max.

930
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Actually, it did sell pretty well.

931
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Maybe that was the nice way of saying we just can't tell you anything right now.

932
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I think, honestly, that was the nice way of saying we can't talk about it.

933
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I hope so.

934
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Alright, we'll hope so too.

935
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Sephiroth, we gotta let you go to take another call. Thanks for calling, alright?

936
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You're welcome.

937
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Alright, thanks.

938
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Alright.

939
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Oh, we got another one already?

940
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Loki, real quick before we answer this.

941
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes.

942
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh, I thought you had a comment.

943
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Hello?

944
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,000
No.

945
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Alright, we'll go phone him.

946
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Hi! You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

947
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Hey, this is SilentWind96 again.

948
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
SilentWind96. Nice to meet you last night. Congratulations.

949
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Hey, thanks for getting in, guys.

950
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
No problem. What'd you think of the E3 Outpost?

951
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Oh, I loved it. It was a lot of fun.

952
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Awesome. If you're in the LA area, come on down. We're right off Santa Monica in 405.

953
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
What'd you call in about?

954
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Just calling to extend my thanks again for letting me hang out with you guys, and I'm on my way home back to Bakersfield.

955
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And I gotta be up at 3 o'clock in the morning to go to work.

956
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Aw, poor guy.

957
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Well, thanks to the call. I'm glad you had a good time. What was something fun you did while you were here?

958
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Well, at the Outpost, I was able to talk to some of the guys from Intellivision and check out the demo for Lost Planet, which was awesome.

959
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah.

960
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And sat there and watched Bobby Platt, the security desk, kicked into UNO by the computer.

961
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's right. Now, SilentWind96 brought us the full version of UNO for us to take a look at.

962
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And I love him for it.

963
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What did you guys think of UNO?

964
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, I had a little bit to drink. A little. And I was sitting back going, UNO. So, yeah.

965
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It was UNO. I had four Astra Smashes.

966
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Black Wolf?

967
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
What UNO?

968
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
UNO.

969
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The computer is a cheese monkey.

970
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The computer is a bitch. I'm sorry. The computer is evil.

971
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Dark Star?

972
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, go ahead.

973
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
There are always pennies. I think he went four plays without even touching the controller.

974
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That would be the first.

975
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You got dicked last night.

976
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The computer cheats.

977
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yeah.

978
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah. It's just a matter of fact. The computer always cheats.

979
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Dark Soccer and I were having an interesting conversation in the bus.

980
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Why play UNO online when you can get a deck of cards and play with your friends?

981
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Because then I couldn't play UNO with Skye.

982
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Aww.

983
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
That makes me warm and fuzzy.

984
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That makes me warm and fuzzy and kind of ill.

985
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

986
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
All right. No, that was my thought, too.

987
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm going to have to get my own gamertag now.

988
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You should.

989
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah.

990
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Silent Wind, any other thoughts for our listeners?

991
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
No, just if you ever get a chance to go down there, that's a great place to hang out.

992
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The staff is awesome and Lawrence and Skye were really accommodating.

993
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's good to put a face on the voice that you hear all the time.

994
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I finally found an iPod and that's all I got here is a podcast from all you guys.

995
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I appreciate your support. You're a true buddy.

996
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And what do you think of the set here?

997
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I love this set.

998
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Silent Wind, what did you think of the set?

999
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Oh, I love the NES. The NES set was awesome.

1000
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I did take pictures with Skye's camera.

1001
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh, good. We'll get those up on the site. Thank you.

1002
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
All right. Silent Wind, we've got to let you go because we're going to get more calls.

1003
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Thanks for calling in, all right?

1004
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
All right. You take care now.

1005
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
All right. You too, buddy.

1006
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's good to meet you.

1007
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
All right. That was Silent Wind, our random contest winner from last night.

1008
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You have to come down here and be on the E3 Outpost.

1009
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Check it out here.

1010
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Bobby, remind the kids how to call in if they want. We'll do a couple more.

1011
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Toll-free number in the United States, 1-866-880-0156.

1012
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I wanted to mention another cool game I played was Hot Pixel.

1013
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That game was awesome.

1014
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's just basically WarioWare on the PSP with old retro Atari games in there as well.

1015
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Freaking awesome.

1016
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Lots of good WarioWare-type games coming to the PSP.

1017
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You mean Atari was showing more than one game?

1018
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah.

1019
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Wow.

1020
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Hot Pixel?

1021
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Hot Pixel.

1022
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's fun.

1023
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And the guy, I guess, who made it or whatever is some crazy-ass French guy.

1024
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I mean, he has this weird skateboard with carpet on it and a fucking PSP holder in there.

1025
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
What a nut.

1026
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But you know what?

1027
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It was cool.

1028
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It was nice to meet him.

1029
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
He actually has a podcast, too.

1030
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't even remember the name of it, but just a weird guy.

1031
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
He's kind of like Mark Echoes on Kraken French.

1032
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Eccentric guy, but I was surprised with Hot Pixel, I thought it would suck.

1033
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But it was actually kind of, it was cute in a, I don't even know how to describe it.

1034
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It was such a weird, quirky, but in a different type of element.

1035
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I mean, the game is totally just like WarioWare, but the minigames are so different.

1036
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's what I like about it.

1037
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I don't know.

1038
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I have another quickie for you guys.

1039
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
99 Nights, I thought was great.

1040
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I thought, it's just mass murder of the game.

1041
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I loved it.

1042
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's a little bit of button mashing, but I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen.

1043
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Gamer Andy's doing a dance.

1044
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Gamer Andy's already drunk.

1045
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Is this the 99 Nights dance?

1046
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Gamer Andy, say hi on Orange Lounge Radio, do a plug for your spiel.

1047
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Tell us about 99 Nights.

1048
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Hi Gamer Andy, what's on your mind?

1049
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Hi, this is Adam from Gamer Andy Live.

1050
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
How are you today?

1051
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I am great.

1052
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That's great.

1053
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What do you think of 99 Nights?

1054
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You know, I played it at the Spring preview and I honestly thought it was more along the

1055
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
realms of the button mashing, Dynasty Warriors-esque sort of thing.

1056
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Which personally isn't really for me.

1057
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Did you like it?

1058
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
No, no dude.

1059
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Didn't like the cut scenes?

1060
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Didn't like any of that stuff?

1061
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Um, you know, the cut scenes were alright, but honestly I really just didn't quite get

1062
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
into it.

1063
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It wasn't my groove, dude.

1064
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Sorry to hear it.

1065
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yeah, you know, I mean, I wanted to like it though.

1066
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Alright, give a quick plug for your stuff.

1067
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Gamer Andy Live, tonight, after these guys.

1068
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
After Orange Lounge Radio, which rocks by the way.

1069
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Thank you, appreciate it.

1070
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Alright.

1071
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
He's drunk.

1072
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
We gotta give the mic back to Jamie now.

1073
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Alright, um.

1074
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I had business.

1075
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I like, 99 Nights is a little bit of button mashing.

1076
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's like Golden Axe, but like, I don't know.

1077
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That was what I was thinking about when I'm playing.

1078
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
This is like Golden Axe, but with more.

1079
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know.

1080
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I see Sonic.

1081
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Right.

1082
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Uh, Mortal Kombat Armageddon.

1083
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Did anyone else play this besides me?

1084
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Hell no.

1085
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You are a green vampire chick with an axe.

1086
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Created character is always awesome in my book.

1087
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And even though I'm a little disappointed Armageddon is only for the current gen stuff,

1088
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I think created character was great.

1089
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I made it.

1090
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Of course the created character that was in there when I loaded it up was the naked woman.

1091
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But how many of those have we seen?

1092
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I mean, when I say naked I mean, you know, bikini.

1093
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But how many of those have we seen in video games?

1094
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So I was gonna make a fun female character.

1095
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So I made a green vampire bitch with a huge meat cleaver as her weapon and it was awesome.

1096
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And you won.

1097
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I did.

1098
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I kicked the shit out of whoever.

1099
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I don't even remember what I was playing against.

1100
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Ermac or something, but it was cool.

1101
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I liked it.

1102
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I think it's a little like if you have the other two Mortal Kombat games from this current generation.

1103
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't think there's a lot else here.

1104
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But I mean, if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, I think you'll have a good time.

1105
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Any other?

1106
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh, we got a call.

1107
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Let's go to the phones and answer the phones.

1108
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1109
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Hey, Jason.

1110
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Hey, Jason.

1111
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
What's up?

1112
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
How are you guys enjoying the game?

1113
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Good.

1114
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
This is Jason, our webmaster, Jason.

1115
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Hi, Jason.

1116
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
We miss having you here.

1117
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Why?

1118
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I wish you were here, Jason.

1119
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Why aren't you here?

1120
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'm not here.

1121
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I'm not there because my truck demands me being here.

1122
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry, Jason.

1123
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm getting insurance and all those things that actually require money for no good reason.

1124
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Oh, I hate that stuff.

1125
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What did you want to call in and say to our listeners besides the fact that you rock?

1126
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Because you do our website stuff for us.

1127
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It's a thankless job, and I love you for it.

1128
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You know that.

1129
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
What did you want to say to our listeners?

1130
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I heard about the existence of, you know, Guitar Man Live, and I'm wondering if they've

1131
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
actually kind of put this up and if you guys have gotten any more information on it.

1132
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Guitar Man Live, we got into a little bit yesterday.

1133
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's Guitar Man Lives.

1134
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Lives, yeah.

1135
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Lives, whatever.

1136
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's a port.

1137
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's Guitar...

1138
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's a port.

1139
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's the same thing as the PS2 with the...

1140
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It has duet mode.

1141
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It's a port.

1142
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's some little things, but if you're looking for new songs...

1143
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
No.

1144
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
No.

1145
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Sorry to say.

1146
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
But if you accidentally pause it, you can continue.

1147
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You don't have to restart from the beginning.

1148
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Andy, that was always a nuisance with, uh...

1149
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Right.

1150
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
With the groove, and if you actually played it on a dance pad and were a silly person

1151
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
like me, cool.

1152
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah.

1153
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Anything else, Jason?

1154
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Uh, not really.

1155
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I was hoping that it was mostly a new game, especially with the duet mode.

1156
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It was actually going to further the storyline or anything along those lines.

1157
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
We were a little disappointed it's not a new game either, but at least the franchise isn't

1158
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
dead.

1159
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I guess that's the silver lining.

1160
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
At least they're still interested.

1161
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Very true.

1162
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So we'll see how it does on the market.

1163
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Excellent.

1164
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Jason, thanks so much for calling in.

1165
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Have a good one, okay?

1166
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Thank you.

1167
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
All right.

1168
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Hey, you know, I checked out another neat game today.

1169
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
What's that?

1170
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Uh, Shin Megami Tensei.

1171
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And real quickly, what's that about?

1172
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Well, um, it's sort of like a detective game with fighting zombies.

1173
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You'll have to tell us more about that after this call.

1174
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah.

1175
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio.

1176
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Hello?

1177
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Hi, who's this?

1178
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I can't hear the caller.

1179
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I can't hear the caller.

1180
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
What's your name, buddy?

1181
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Try again.

1182
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
DJ Pooh Eater.

1183
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
DJ Pooh Eater.

1184
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Oh, DJ Pooh Eater!

1185
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Hey!

1186
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Hey!

1187
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
What's on your mind?

1188
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You're breaking up a little bit, so get your thought out.

1189
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I want to know that anymore.

1190
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I didn't catch that.

1191
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
DJ Pooh Eater, we're going to have to let you go, buddy.

1192
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
DJ Pooh Eater, we're going to have to let you go because you're breaking up too much.

1193
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But thanks for trying.

1194
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1195
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
All right.

1196
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Have a good one.

1197
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
All right.

1198
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Are we?

1199
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Let's go to another call.

1200
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Let's try a different call.

1201
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Oh, they hung up.

1202
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah.

1203
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh, here it is again.

1204
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1205
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Hi, this is Jade at 2006.

1206
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Jade at 2006.

1207
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Hey!

1208
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

1209
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, nothing much.

1210
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
This is mainly a question for Bobby.

1211
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Bobby!

1212
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
A question for Bobby.

1213
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Uh-oh.

1214
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Bobby taking over our show.

1215
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Thanks a lot.

1216
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Noah, what's up?

1217
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
What's the question for Bobby?

1218
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
What is your honest opinion about Wii Music?

1219
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Okay, the Wii Music was just the Wii Orchestra.

1220
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
They had a drum game, but it was closed off, even to media.

1221
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Like, you had to actually have an appointment to play it.

1222
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But the orchestra...

1223
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm glad Matt was the orchestra.

1224
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah, the orchestra...

1225
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Okay, here's the thing.

1226
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I was having trouble with it because I've actually conducted an orchestra before.

1227
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And it's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.

1228
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But all it was was playing the Zelda theme.

1229
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And yeah, you can cue other places.

1230
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You can cue the back of the orchestra and they'll play louder.

1231
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You know, you can slow them down and start them up.

1232
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But it takes a little while to get used to it.

1233
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I only played through it twice.

1234
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
When you play that game, do you look as fruity as Miyamoto did at the conference?

1235
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
No, I actually look...

1236
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I look like a real...

1237
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Most people do.

1238
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
They're like, you know, just waving their arms and like dancing around like he did.

1239
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You know, when I say Miyamoto's being fruity, I tease with love.

1240
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because that's why we love him is because he's just a crazy little man.

1241
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Just to point out though, you're mentioning about having a hard time actually conducting

1242
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
for real with it.

1243
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I did also...

1244
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
When I went through there, Koji Kondo was playing.

1245
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And he actually, I can tell, wasn't doing true conducting.

1246
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Right.

1247
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah, you have to do it like, you know, it's really rigid.

1248
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And it looks like it's actually, if you know anything about like conducting,

1249
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
it's actually the up motion is what triggers it, not the down motion.

1250
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I learned that like right at the very end of my second thing.

1251
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm like, oh, it's going on the up.

1252
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
All right.

1253
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
J to 2006.

1254
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Any other thoughts for us?

1255
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Is it as easy as Miyamoto made it look? How about that?

1256
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah.

1257
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I mean, you're not going to be good at it, but yeah, I mean, it's, you know,

1258
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
waving your arms like people who've never done music stuff were able to get through it.

1259
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
All right.

1260
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And it does score you at the end.

1261
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
J to...

1262
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh, wonderful.

1263
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
J to 2006.

1264
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
We got to let you go.

1265
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
We're going to start wrapping it up.

1266
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
All right?

1267
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Okay.

1268
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
All right.

1269
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Thanks so much for the call.

1270
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Have a good one.

1271
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Have a good one too.

1272
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
All right.

1273
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Well, Poor Spirit Snare has been trying to call in for like the past 30 minutes.

1274
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And if somebody else always gets in...

1275
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Well, we got the wrap-up sign, so we got to start wrapping it up.

1276
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Spirit Snare, tomorrow, buddy, call in.

1277
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
We'll get you.

1278
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm so sorry.

1279
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But of course, there's always the forums.

1280
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
There's live journal.

1281
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
This is for anybody that wants to talk to us, but maybe is too shy to call in.

1282
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Our stuff blog, stuff.orangelandrater.com.

1283
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Even MySpace if you really want to.

1284
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
We've got all that stuff going on, so check it out.

1285
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Anyway, really quickly though, real quick, I had to do this for the shows overnight.

1286
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
The FUs of the week.

1287
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Bobby, give us a little bit of the...

1288
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
All right.

1289
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
All right.

1290
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Dark Sakura, do you have any FUs so far at E3?

1291
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Not really, actually.

1292
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Really?

1293
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yeah.

1294
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I've actually been pretty much okay with it, except I still think...

1295
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And this actually really surprised me.

1296
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
My husband's actually pretty happy about it.

1297
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I want to say FU to Capcom, because why the hell are you going to put NES Strider on the PSP?

1298
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh, they put NES Strider on the PSP?

1299
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah.

1300
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:12,000
That Capcom classics collection is the NES versions of Mighty Final Fight, Bionic Commando,

1301
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,000
which Dan was like, Bionic Commando, and the NES version of Strider, which actually isn't a bad game.

1302
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It's all based off of the Strider comics.

1303
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But I was like, I have these at home.

1304
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I can just play them at home.

1305
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Why do I want these on my PSP?

1306
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But what about those of us who don't have those at home?

1307
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Is it a bad thing to have?

1308
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You can download it.

1309
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So it is a bad thing to have if we don't have those games at home.

1310
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
There's other ways to get it.

1311
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I just don't see any reason to...

1312
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
They should have touched it up or made it a little bit cleaner, and it is an exact port of the NES ones.

1313
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Some people like that.

1314
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
We gotta keep the angst flowing, because we gotta wrap it up.

1315
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Loki, your F.U.

1316
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
My F.U. goes to Nintendo for a couple reasons.

1317
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The first, because their party wasn't exactly great, even if the black IPs were there,

1318
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and also because their booth sucks ass as far as the design goes,

1319
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and it makes it nearly impossible to play anything new that they have.

1320
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Notice I didn't talk about the Wii today.

1321
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
That's because I didn't play it.

1322
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I tried to go to the line at 1230, and they told me, tough titty, because...

1323
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It closed at 10 o'clock.

1324
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
They were doing a private party, which was more important.

1325
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Closed at 10.

1326
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Do your private party after hours.

1327
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Dummies.

1328
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Closed at 10 o'clock.

1329
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Bobby, your F.U.

1330
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
My F.U. goes to three people, and one of them, his name is Scott Rubin,

1331
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
who was supposed to be the one that was picking me up at 8.15 in the morning at my hotel,

1332
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
so I could get there by 9 o'clock.

1333
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Unfortunately, he misjudged L.A. traffic and got to my hotel at 8.45,

1334
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and so that meant that I got to the convention center at 9.30.

1335
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,000
My second F.U. goes to Redmond Carpolio from the Los Angeles newspaper group...

1336
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Who, by the way, is standing right in front of Bobby right now.

1337
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I know this is radio.

1338
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
...who pulled some strings.

1339
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
He was standing in the Nintendo line.

1340
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I was going to join him in the line, and he pulled some strings,

1341
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and they went into the Nintendo booth.

1342
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And my third F.U. goes to Lawrence Young for going with him

1343
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
and not waiting for me because they did the Jack Bauer time going,

1344
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
There's no time!

1345
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And then for Lawrence Young, the last F.U. was for calling me and saying,

1346
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Bobby B., I'm one foot away from Madden 07.

1347
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And I was like an hour and a half away from getting in, so...

1348
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I still love you, Lawrence, for whatever it's worth.

1349
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You edit the show so I don't have to. I love you for that.

1350
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
My F.U. goes to the people that were waiting in line to see Paris Hilton.

1351
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Get out of my E3! Get out!

1352
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Those are the people that need to be sterilized.

1353
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Why would you stand in line to see her? Why?

1354
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's a goddamn mobile game, too. Why? Shame on you.

1355
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
That's a double negative, which is not a positive. That's a double bad thing.

1356
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
A curse on all your houses.

1357
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
A curse on your people. I hope you all go sterile.

1358
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Yes. May they never breed.

1359
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
We gotta wrap it up. Final thoughts. Dark Soccer, your final thought.

1360
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Uh...nap.

1361
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Loki, your final thought.

1362
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
My final thought is I'm gonna play Crackdown tomorrow because I forgot it was there.

1363
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Bobby, thanks for being here again. Your final thought.

1364
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Reject false icons.

1365
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Thank you.

1366
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I also forgot to mention, two nights in a row,

1367
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Superman Returns is fucking awesome, and it would be a better Grand Theft Auto game.

1368
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah!

1369
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
My final thought is Enchanted Arms looks really pretty. I wish they'd let me play it.

1370
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah.

1371
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Alright. That's it. We gotta go, guys. We'll be back here Friday night live at the E3 Outpost.

1372
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Thanks to the E3 Outpost staff for having us. If you're listening live, Gamer Andy's up next.

1373
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So don't go anywhere or he will come find you and disco dance at your living room.

1374
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
They can take a quick pee break if they need to.

1375
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That's scary. Yeah, you can do a quick pee break, but be back here by 9.

1376
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Be back by 9 Pacific. Alright, roll the credits. We're done.

1377
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
