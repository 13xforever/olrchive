00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are live at the E3 Outpost for this Friday 2006 E3 edition.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome everybody to the Friday edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are here live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles,

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
where we've been taping our post-E3 shows all week long.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yo, what up?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And of course, Tech Massa Loki.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And moseying his way on over to a microphone there.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Joining us for this last of our E3 shows is the one and only Bobby Blackwell,

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
who has no microphone right now.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's all right.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We have mic troubles. That's all right. Live radio, boys and girls.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think...

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's coming.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There you go. There you are. That's all right.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And of course, once again, wave hello to producer Lawrence Young,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
who's over there in the corner.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
God, I wish we could take him back to Sacramento with us.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He's been awesome all week long.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Again, if you're downloading this podcast,

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
you've listened to us before,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but you're not sure why you're hearing all the background noise tonight.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We're live. It's a big little party.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A big little party.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's a little space, but it's a big party.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And there's lots of people here, and they're playing games.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like I see Soul Calibur. I can't tell if it's two or three.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We have some Smash Brothers still going on.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There's Smash Brothers. Everybody loves Smash Brothers.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I see Halo down there.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mario Kart Double Dash.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I would think people would be sick of games by the end of this show.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Fight Night Round 3.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think they even had Rampage Soul Construction.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, awesome.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They have black going on on one of the TVs over there.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sweet.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know about you guys, but I think I might be sick of games after today.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, I'm kidding. You know I'll go right back home and play games again,

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
but boy, overload.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was going to say, do you have a fever?

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you feeling okay?

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No, it's great. It's exhausting.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I know a lot of people sitting at home

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
are probably screaming at me going,

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sky, you ungrateful bastard, at least you get to go to E3.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, yeah, trust me, I don't take that for granted.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm very lucky to be able to go, but it is very tiring.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And if you were here, you'd say the same thing.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's like, shit, I'm exhausted.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You know, I'm craving some Ridge Racer 6

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
since they didn't have Ridge Racer 7 at PlayStation or Namco's booth this year,

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
except for a video.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I know, kind of disappointing, huh?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know why I'm craving it.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I just need to play it.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The craving is there. The itch is there.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm craving tacos.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Quick programming note, you guys, for you Orange Lounge Radio fans.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There will be no live program this Sunday, which is Mother's Day.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So spend some extra time with your mother

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
or, you know, motherly figure in your life,

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the politically correct term there.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or catch up on the free podcast that we had.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There you go.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Unfortunately, we've just, we got other stuff going on due to the holiday

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and, you know, just the fact that we're driving home from E3 and all that.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So we hope our listeners will understand,

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but we'll be back, of course, our normal time next Sunday.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're just burnt out from the week.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A little bit.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A little bit.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I plan on playing that new game, Extreme Nap Action.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to the chat room there over at www, I'm sorry,

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
chat.allgames.com tonight.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm so used to plugging the other room.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Tonight, we're at chat.allgames.com.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Next week, we'll be back to the Orange Lounge Radio chat

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
over at orangelaunchradio.com.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can always interact with us on our forums over there as well.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Reading chat right now, let's see, jaded2006 says,

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
LOL, there are so many video games.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How can you get sick of them?

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Exactly.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Get back and read the first part of your sentence and then ask that again.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With so many video games comes so much walking

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and so many lines, including those for food.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So sorry to tell you.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You know what?

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What?

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I actually didn't have a really long line for food.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It was much better this year.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It was only for coffee.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We landed off to the expo.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They did a much better job with food this year than last year.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think that was because of the Wii line and everybody was in that.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The long lines were like for the grill and everything.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm like sandwich, tuna.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They had much more stuff set up outside this year,

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
which I thought was smart.

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They had the barbecue grills like you were kind of saying

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and all that stuff.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think people started bringing food too, which is also smart.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They had some really healthy selections this time around.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I was very pleased because I don't do the meat thing.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They had tuna.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Good to hear it.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They had bagels and coffee.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Lots of coffee for me this weekend, this week.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's go around and play two interesting things tonight

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because we have other topics we want to get to, so we can't do three.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We're going to do two interesting things tonight.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Dark Sakura, two interesting things you saw at the show today.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Start with one.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I had it in my head and it was in that issue of EGM.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'd been reading down there and I completely forgot what it was.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I'm going to say X-Deal by NCSoft.

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That was very, very interesting.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's like virtual on, but a lot more and it's going to be a free game,

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
a free download, free game through PlayNC.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I like free.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My ears perk up when I hear free.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They had a whole series of games.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Dungeon Runner, there was Smash Star, which they're going to rename.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's already out in Korea.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And Soccer Fury, which was very, very detailed.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was like hardcore beat everyone up soccer.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Very cool.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So you can't beat the price of free.

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How did you enjoy the tour over there, that booth?

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It was pretty cool.

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The Guild Wars room was actually sort of like maybe I should play Guild Wars.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because you bashed Guild Wars on this show before.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Not necessarily bashed.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It just wasn't fun for me when I played it before.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But actually better than that, I'm actually considering trying Tabula Rasa.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Very cool.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because I like the whole sci-fi, kill aliens, shoot things, fun.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Guild Wars fans will be happy to hear the new expansions winning people over.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Loki, we're playing two interesting things.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's one of your two?

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh man, you know, I've been so lazy today.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You know, I know I played a lot of things today,

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but I don't remember half the stuff I played.

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
God.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you want to cheat, tell them something from Wednesday or Thursday

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that we haven't talked about yet and they won't know the difference.

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I guess.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I played, was it, okay Spore.

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Spore was, you know, huge.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It was just an awesome looking game.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And not really much more I can say.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I mean, if you've watched the Game Developers Conference video of it,

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it's basically that.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's just, it's one of those games where I'm just going to sit there and destroy everything.

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Create a race of vicious aliens that go and just decimate everything.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's what I'm doing with Spore.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I loved Spore.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Loved it.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I mean, I was surprised.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I didn't know much about it going into the show today.

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I know there's a lot of buzz, but I'm only one guy.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't follow everything.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I wanted to go see it because of the buzz.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And even though we had a little problem at EA's booth trying to get in there,

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but we won't go there,

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
we finally got into the Spore thing.

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It was much more than anyone could possibly expect.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you haven't been following this game, there is so much to it.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And so much of it has to do with the user, the way you build things,

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and the way people that you know and random strangers in the universe build things.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It is so phenomenally impressive.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is going to be the next Sims, honestly.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Which is not surprising.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I mean, it's Will Wright, but it's incredible.

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I would be very interested to see if something like this comes out on a console, too.

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because I know right now it's only PC, right?

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's just PC, but...

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They're saying DS and PSP as well, but...

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
There was a job posting about porting Spore to the DS.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's kind of weird.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I think it would be a bastardized version, though, like those Sims.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It should really be on the 360,

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
or something that's really connected to the internet all the time.

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Wow.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The Wii.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There you go.

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Bobby, what's one of two interesting things you saw today at E3?

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is going to be a surprising one,

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
because I'm sitting here, you know, Nintendo fanboy and stuff,

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and really bashing on Sony.

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Interesting that I actually enjoyed Warhawk.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Really?

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I actually played it, already to be able to be all bashing it and all that stuff.

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was having fun!

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So what exactly was the demo like? What did you do in the demo?

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, there was a single-player and a multi-player demo,

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but I did the single-player demo just because it was near the end of the show.

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Essentially, you just flew around shooting planes,

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and then you had to shoot down four frigates and stuff.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The control scheme, it was no different for the people who were listening to radio.

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can't see me doing this.

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you have ever made a plane with your hand and just flown around and made the noise...

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We all did that as kids.

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's what it felt like I was doing.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's how I was flying the plane.

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's nothing like innovative or new or anything, but it was fun!

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The graphics probably could have been better a little bit,

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
but the game was fun, and I was not expecting that going into it.

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's great.

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The lines for Warhawk when I wanted to try and see it were really, really long,

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
so I didn't really get a chance to do it.

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, I waited until the end of the last day, and there were two people in front of me.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have to ask.

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The controller, how did that feel?

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How was that tilt controller?

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was very responsive on the movements for the plane, and it felt light.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a little light controller, and it felt fine.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's just got some accelerometers in it.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's all that's really got.

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Interesting.

226
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
One interesting thing I saw today, or I should say one interesting experience,

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
was thanks to a listener of Orange Lounge Radio...

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You guys rock.

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
...I got to cut the Wii line.

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Wii!

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Exactly, that's why I said Wii!

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Justin from Vegas, if you're out there listening, I owe you my firstborn,

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
except I don't have a uterus, so I don't know how it's going to work.

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I owe you so big, thank you so much.

235
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It was totally a chance thing.

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We literally ran into each other, and he's like,

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going to go see the Wii, and I think I get to cut in line.

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You want to come with me?

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm like, fuck yeah.

240
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We went over, and sure enough, he talked to his person.

241
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We were able to go in there. I was very happy.

242
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The downside to that is that once you get in there,

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it's still a bitch to actually get to play any of the demos,

244
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
so we just got to cut that four-hour line to wait to get in there.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We still had to wait in the lines once we got in there to play stuff.

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I will say, I thought, well, I guess that whole experience is interesting,

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
but while I have the Wii brought up, this is why I played.

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I played Excite Truck, which I thought was more fun than it looked in the preview.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I thought it was a fun time.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The graphics are nothing to scream at, but all the games are widescreen,

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
which made me very happy, so that's good.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a step up for Nintendo.

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Also WarioWare, which was great.

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a little tough at first because you have to keep changing the controller's positions,

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
but you get used to it, and I thought it was really cute.

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I played the tennis thing as well, which I sucked at.

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Justin floored me on that game with my ass, but it was fun.

258
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Did you get to play Zelda?

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No, lines were way too long, and I had to be back somewhere else.

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's too bad. That was actually the only one I had any interest in playing,

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and I got right up there. It was great.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Lucky you. Lucky you.

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I got right up there too, but I had a guy help me get up there too,

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
so we had the same experience on that one.

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
All right, let's do one more interesting thing,

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then we'll get into some of the best and worst of E3,

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
like best booth, best games, all that good stuff.

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Dark Soccer, one more interesting thing.

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I saw something that made me cry.

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay.

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That Bomberman Zero thing.

272
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ah, Bomberman Zero.

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That was awful.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I mean, yeah, it plays like Bomberman, but it's too hardcore looking.

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Bomberman's supposed to be cute.

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I remember seeing those old Hudson Japanese commercials

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
where the person dressed up in the giant Bomberman suit

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
running all over the place being chased by the person in the other suit.

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Did you play the Bomberman game on the Wii?

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, I didn't get to.

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They had that thing tucked away in the corner.

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But that made me sad.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That took a piece of my childhood and destroyed it in front of me.

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's like if they tried to do 3D Gem or something.

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That just broke my heart.

286
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
All right.

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Loki, one more interesting thing you saw at E3 today.

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Elite Beat Agents.

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That game is awesome.

290
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's just really fun to play, and it's got a really crazy-ass storyline.

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This topic that came up on Bobby's show earlier,

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
for those that have no idea what the eff this game is,

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
what is this all about?

294
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, originally it came out as, I think, Ouiden in Japan.

295
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
From what I gather, because I wasn't quite paying attention to the storyline,

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
trying to figure out how to play,

297
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
there's these three guys that just come and basically fix situations.

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There was this guy, this girl babysitter,

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
who was trying to ask her boyfriend to go study with her.

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Then the mom comes and makes her babysit.

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So the Elite Beat Agents come to entertain the children to get them to go to bed.

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And so it's got this art style and kind of a storyline,

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
almost like Phoenix Wright,

304
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
across with a little bit of Katamari.

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's just really off the wall, but it's fun.

306
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's easy. You just tap these circles on the bottom screen on the DS

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
with the beat of the music,

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and there's a few other interactive things you can do with the touch screen,

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but it goes all with the music, and it's really fun.

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's definitely going to be one of those classic games,

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
kind of like Guitar Man and Luminous and all that stuff.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Really good music games.

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
All right. Awesome.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Joining us, taking Bobby's place momentarily, Sam.

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Nobody can take Bobby's place.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, maybe two of me.

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, no, no. We love Bobby.

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But he just did a live show from the Outpost,

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
which you can check out at AllGames.com.

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
They're rebroadcasting a Sunday, right, I'm sure?

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Your show will rebroadcast on Sunday, or will you be doing another show?

322
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He's not going to do another show.

323
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No. He's done for the week.

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He's got a mom. He's got to visit.

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So say hello to Scott Rubin, who's joining us from AllGames Interactive,

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
which airs here on AllGames.

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Some of you guys might know Scott from his days at G4 Television.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And you were on a show there, G4TV.com.

329
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Right. The show named after a website named after a TV show,

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
named after a TV network.

331
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The brilliant, genius mind behind that was actually the CEO of the network.

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I wanted to call it AllGames something, and he was like,

333
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
no, why don't we name it after the website

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
so that we can promote the website on the show?

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No hard feelings, though, right?

336
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
None. I actually saw him.

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I was at E3 on Thursday, sitting at the Sony booth,

338
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
getting ready to come here,

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and one of the sales guys from G4 saw me and said,

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
hey, by the way, I just want to let you know, Charles is nearby.

341
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Charles Hirschhorn together.

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And Charles, you know, whatever, he got the network up,

343
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but he kind of ruined a lot of the fun, creative stuff that people wanted to do,

344
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
so it was a very awkward moment. I thought I'd share that with you.

345
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll say it, since I don't know if you can all say it.

346
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
G4 went totally down the toilet.

347
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean, we get guys. What is that?

348
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We get guys is a slogan that used to be the main slogan for West Hollywood here in California.

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And they still get guys, so G4 is hoping that some of that will rub off.

350
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, well, more power to them. I don't know. We'll see.

351
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But as a gay guy who's been to West Hollywood,

352
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll say still not interested.

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Still not interested.

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They can't even win over the gays, so sorry.

355
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Anyway, no, seriously, though, Scott, we've been playing a game here,

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Interesting Things You Saw at E3.

357
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What was one interesting thing you saw at E3 today?

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Interesting Thing I Saw at E3.

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Interesting can be a game. It can be something you saw, anything.

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, I'll tell you, it is an interesting thing I see at every E3.

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know if this is going to sound mean.

362
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't mean to make it sound mean,

363
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
but it seems like if you're paralyzed or quadriplegic, you get into E3.

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I see lots of people in wheelchairs that are not moving a lot.

365
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They have almost no use of their arms and legs,

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
but I don't believe they work for retailers or the media,

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but somehow they seem to get in.

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Some of them even look very young under the 18-age limit.

369
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But, see, now that could be like a make-a-wish thing or something.

370
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah, no, I agree. You said something.

371
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay, it is interesting.

372
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's an interesting commentary.

373
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Obviously, I'm not saying anything bad.

374
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
In fact, some of my favorite moments have been at E3,

375
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
especially when I was on the air at G4,

376
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
where I would be approached by a family member,

377
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and they would say to us that he watches the show all the time.

378
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He's a really big fan.

379
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Gaming, and I've always said this, gaming is the great equalizer

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
because when you play an online game from home,

381
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it doesn't matter if you're black, white, old, young,

382
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
male, female, handicapped or not,

383
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
when you're in that game, nobody knows who you are

384
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
other than your actions in the game.

385
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I've always loved that about games,

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that you could be anyone, literally, when you play games.

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So it's always nice to see people who love games

388
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and can get a chance to get close to the industry like that

389
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and see how they experience it.

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean, you guys have been to E3 before,

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
so you kind of take it for granted after a while,

392
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
but it is fascinating.

393
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I watched a couple of people come in just the past couple of days,

394
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and their eyes light up as if they've entered Disneyland.

395
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, that was me the first year.

396
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know, Dark Soccer, was that you the first year?

397
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I had sort of an idea of what to expect

398
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
because my friend, who's another GameStop manager,

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
he brings us a video every year.

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I sort of had an idea of what to expect,

401
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but my first year, it's like going and seeing everything so big,

402
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I was like, where to first?

403
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, it's overwhelming the first year.

404
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Which meant camping out at Konami for two hours.

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You've got to have a plan, I've found that.

406
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You've got to have a plan, you've got to have comfortable shoes.

407
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Amen.

408
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And you've really got to have a plan.

409
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Now, I have not been a part of your live broadcast before.

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Sky refusing to look at chat,

411
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
he refuses to acknowledge the people in the chat room?

412
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, no, they're there.

413
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I mean, they're just not saying anything interesting.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And Loki, you also, you don't even bring chat up.

415
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

416
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Loki doesn't even, usually I do, but Loki hates chatters.

417
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He hates chatters.

418
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's not quite an actual Wonder Woman outfit.

419
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's not a Wonder Woman outfit?

420
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, no, because Wonder Woman, that's a bikini.

421
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, you know something, you're right.

422
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That could be the reason behind it all.

423
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, that's why she got kicked out.

424
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Wonder Woman had a full...

425
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Right, right.

426
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There you go.

427
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay, you want to know why I'm not reading chat?

428
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Here's the comment right now.

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Who said Tommy Tallarico?

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think somebody's very confused about who's on the show right now.

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I have no idea.

432
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's why I'm not reading chat.

433
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
All right, well, you've actually got a good point there.

434
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Now, what is it?

435
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Paris Hilton doesn't know the name of her own game?

436
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah.

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Loki, what is this?

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It was funny because she showed up late yesterday

439
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and she ended up calling her game, which I believe...

440
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't even remember what it's called now, but...

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know.

442
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
She called it, like, Diamond Quest or something,

443
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and it's completely off of what the game is supposed to be.

444
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Called Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam, and she called it Diamond Quest.

445
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah.

446
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Well...

447
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Who's expecting her to have a brain?

448
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah.

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's like she...

450
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't even know what my game is called,

451
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
despite the fact that it's written right behind her.

452
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, it's on the wall behind her.

453
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're assuming she can read.

454
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's also got her name in it,

455
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
so she went from calling it Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam

456
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
to just Diamond Quest.

457
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, well, you know, that's what happens

458
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
when you hire a dumb, blond millionaire to promote your game.

459
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You need to have someone poor and usually a gamer

460
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
if you want them to actually give credibility to your game.

461
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.

462
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm going to go ahead and try to wrap up

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the two interesting things game.

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
One more interesting thing I saw today,

465
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and, boy, so much to see.

466
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What else would I say would be one more interesting thing?

467
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Probably the use of Pac-Man arcade machines

468
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to put the cell phone game in.

469
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I thought it was a very interesting use of...

470
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's almost vandalizing, a classic piece of machinery.

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But I suppose it's Namco.

472
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They can do what they want with it.

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's true.

474
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
As somebody who used to be a huge pinball fan,

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I will give Namco this.

476
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I thought the baby Pac-Man machine being there.

477
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know, baby Pac-Man was the Pac-Man game

478
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
that was half Pac-Man, half pinball.

479
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Right.

480
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There will be pictures going up on our side of this machine.

481
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Dark Soccer loves this, too.

482
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We've been, like...

483
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I've never got a chance to go back over there

484
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and make an offer on it.

485
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We've been co-hunting for, like, a...

486
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
She'll actually be able to afford it,

487
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
but I've been secretly wanting a baby Pac-Man machine for forever.

488
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So it was kind of weird to see one there,

489
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
but you couldn't play it because they were advertising

490
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
the baby Pac-Man cell phone game on it.

491
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Ah.

492
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It actually wasn't even baby Pac-Man.

493
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It was just Pac-Man pinball, which wasn't all that great.

494
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I played quite a number of mobile phone games

495
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
over at Namco Mobile.

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
All right, let's go to chat room

497
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
because now they're finally saying something interesting.

498
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You know I'm only giving you a hard time, Chad.

499
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You know I love you guys.

500
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If you want to join in, tonight we're in chat.allgames.com.

501
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We are hijacking the All Games chat room

502
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
for our own evil purposes.

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
CKY Mike says,

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Sky, anything about Resident Evil 5?

505
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I don't think...

506
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It wasn't on the floor.

507
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I didn't see it.

508
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh, yeah.

509
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It wasn't on the floor.

510
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I think there was a trailer,

511
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
but it was one of those...

512
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It was like the Final Fantasy XIII trailer.

513
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What did that tell you besides,

514
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
hey, it's being made and it's coming to the system.

515
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's it.

516
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There really wasn't a lot of news on Resident Evil 5.

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Well, there was a ton of games last year, too,

518
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
that they were showing at Square Enix's booth

519
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
that we didn't even see this year.

520
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's true.

521
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So they disappeared.

522
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Like what? Give us examples.

523
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't remember what they're called now.

524
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
There's like a trilogy of games,

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
all of which I was not interested in.

526
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then also Devil May Cry 4.

527
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I didn't see that at all.

528
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It wasn't even shown.

529
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What was really pissing me off

530
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
was the fact that Fatal Inertia wasn't on the floor

531
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
other than just video.

532
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah.

533
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Wow.

534
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
All right.

535
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Let's go around and give out some awards.

536
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We're going to do our own personal assessments

537
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
for the best and worst of E3.

538
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Scott, are you going to join in on us with this here?

539
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Absolutely.

540
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
All right. Here we go.

541
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Best game of E3.

542
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think last year we did two.

543
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We did a runner-up

544
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and the best game that you played at E3.

545
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Using any criteria you want.

546
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Absolutely anything you want.

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And nobody can argue with you because it's your review.

548
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So anybody feeling brave that wants to start with a runner-up?

549
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Dark Sakura.

550
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, no. I don't know what my runner-up is right now.

551
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay. All right. Loki, do you have one?

552
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah.

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You know, this one I actually didn't play

554
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
because it was only a video.

555
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But I'm going to have to go with Dead or Alive Extreme 2.

556
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And why is this?

557
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Because, sadly enough, I will probably buy that game.

558
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Because he likes the boobies.

559
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And I like the achievement points.

560
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And he likes the boobies.

561
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's right. You're an achievement point whore.

562
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Are you a fan of the Barbie dress-up mode, basically,

563
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
where you get to choose bikinis for the girls and all that stuff?

564
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I just had to laugh at that game just by looking at it

565
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
because it's so blatantly...

566
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's like a Girls Gone Wild video.

567
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Literally, they have that new series of Girls Gone Wild videos

568
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
that you see late at night,

569
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
where they're making them do games.

570
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, that's basically this.

571
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay.

572
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I would say my runner-up, I'll go next.

573
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
My runner-up is Gears of War.

574
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I thought Gears of War looked fantabulous.

575
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
What I also like about it is that it looks like they've designed it

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
so any dummy can do cool moves in it, which I think is great.

577
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Even though I'm not a huge shooter fan,

578
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I will go to that realm once in a while for a great, great shooter game like Halo.

579
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I think Gears of War is going to be one of those great shooter games

580
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
if the demo is any indication.

581
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Plus, I love the way Microsoft had it set up, but I'll get into that later.

582
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So Dark Soccer, you got one?

583
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

584
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the PSP. Why?

585
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Because it's Ghosts and Goblins.

586
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I mean, that is like the peak of anything Capcom has out.

587
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I mean, I love the old games.

588
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And this does it so right.

589
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It takes the best elements from the early games,

590
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
touches them up, makes it look really clean,

591
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
takes a little advantage of the PSP's resolution.

592
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It was just really gorgeous. The play was great.

593
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
They've added to it just enough to where it doesn't ruin it by overdoing it,

594
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
but it just touches it up a bit. It was very good.

595
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It was a very solid pla-

596
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's probably one of the first solid platformers I've seen in ages.

597
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Alright.

598
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Like, since the days of Planilla.

599
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Excellent. Alright. Well, congratulations to Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

600
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Dark Sakura chooses you.

601
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Scott!

602
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm excited.

603
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know, I've been sitting here kind of like rolling to my head, you know,

604
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and most of my thoughts have been,

605
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
well, I do have a lot of most surprising,

606
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
like, surprise me good and most disappointing.

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But I'm gonna save those for my show.

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm gonna answer your question specifically.

609
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Best of show, there's no question in my mind.

610
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Wait, you gotta do runner up.

611
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, geez.

612
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Uh, oh, god.

613
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Runner up?

614
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Uh, yeah.

615
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You know what? I'm gonna say, for runner up, I'm gonna say Saints Row.

616
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Ah.

617
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
This is a game that, obviously, without a Grand Theft Auto title on the Xbox 360,

618
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm looking for that kind of open-ended, hard-jacking, blow stuff up,

619
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
different kinds of weapons.

620
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Obviously, what I like about Saints Row is that it goes another step further

621
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and allows me to create anybody I want to be the main character.

622
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I really went for it.

623
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I got the spiky here, big fat guy, and I could run around the city like that.

624
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That's the one where you could be the girl or the guy, right?

625
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't know if you could be the girl.

626
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's basically a gang type.

627
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's a THQ game.

628
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It was at the Microsoft booth, and then right across from Microsoft booth,

629
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
they had, like, three or four demo stations there.

630
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But it's, again, it's carjacking.

631
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's very similar to Grand Theft Auto.

632
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's made by Volition, the guys that did Red Faction and what was the other,

633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Free Space, Descent Free Space.

634
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And it's well done.

635
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I was always concerned because every time we've seen footage for this game,

636
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
it's been choppy.

637
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The frame rate has been bad.

638
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The word has been that it's not going to be ready, it's not going to be good,

639
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and it's been delayed.

640
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But my time with it was fun.

641
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It definitely needs a little more work,

642
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
but I would say that is my runner-up for Best of Show.

643
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Awesome.

644
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
All right.

645
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Best of Show, the best game, damn game at E3, period,

646
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
using any criteria you want, Loki.

647
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This is tough.

648
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I know what you're going to say, so I'll have to say something else.

649
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Also, there's just too much good stuff at E3 this year,

650
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
but if I had to pick one game, you know, Dead Rising, I love that game.

651
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I think it's just one of those games that I'm going to be playing for hours,

652
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and I've said that over and over.

653
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's just very open-ended.

654
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
When you basically do anything, the game's only about three hours long,

655
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
but you can play it over and over and over and over again.

656
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Give us a brief description of the game

657
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
because I don't think it's been brought up on the podcast yet.

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay, well, Dead Rising basically is Dawn of the Dead, the game.

659
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You play a main character who is this photojournalist,

660
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and you're stuck in a mall with a bunch of zombies,

661
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
but you can kill the zombies in any way possible,

662
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
anything that's anywhere in the game.

663
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
In stores, you can pick up any item and just use it as a weapon.

664
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
There's like over 200 items.

665
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You can customize your character and the way he looks.

666
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You can rescue people.

667
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You take photos of stuff.

668
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's just a really unique, different game.

669
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I love it.

670
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
My Best in Show is one I think we've already talked about tonight,

671
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
but it stole the show for me.

672
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's incredible.

673
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's massive.

674
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's spore.

675
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
A game is phenomenal looking.

676
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The only concern I have about it is I think it might be too much,

677
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but the interactiveness, I love that stuff.

678
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I love the fact that what your friends do can screw up your world.

679
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I love the freedom to abduct aliens and then hurl them into space

680
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and watch them fall crashing down to earth in a bloody pulp.

681
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It looks like one of those games you're going to have the freedom

682
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
to do whatever you want.

683
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's going to be incredible.

684
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Don't get me wrong.

685
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I love PC gaming, but I would love to see a game like this on 360 as well,

686
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
if it's possible.

687
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Maybe.

688
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't know.

689
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I just think it might be too massive for the confines of a console, though.

690
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So PC gamers, you really are getting a good one with this one, spore.

691
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Dark Sakura.

692
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm going to go with Zelda, honestly.

693
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I love the Zelda series, like almost every one of them,

694
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
with the exception of Majora's Mask and Wind Waker.

695
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So this looked like it was really following directly in the footsteps

696
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:07,000
of Ocarina of Time, which was probably one of my favorites in the series.

697
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Just having the Wii U-Con, or Wiimote.

698
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The Wiimote, as I call it.

699
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yes, thank you.

700
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The Wii-Con, as I call it.

701
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You know, feeling the shake of the chain as you throw the claw hook,

702
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
hearing it impact, you know, hearing the twang of your bow as it flies back.

703
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That is if you put the thing right by your ear.

704
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The control was a little bit interesting to get used to,

705
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
but other than that it was, and it really didn't look like it was touched up

706
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
much more than the GameCube, but honestly,

707
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
everyone who listens to our show knows about how much I give a damn

708
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
about the graphics, which is like hardly any.

709
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It was fun.

710
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It was a lot of fun.

711
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And probably the most fun of anything I played, you know,

712
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
next to Ghosts and Goblins, so that gets it.

713
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Very neat.

714
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's an interesting choice because Zelda was such a huge game

715
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
at last year's E3.

716
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Was enough changed?

717
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Is it worth the wait?

718
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There was quite a bit changed.

719
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I didn't get to see the demo, but I had talked to plenty who did.

720
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You mean last year, right?

721
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Last year.

722
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I had gone back and seen things later of it.

723
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It looks like they've really cleaned it up.

724
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I was actually just checking out that issue of EGM sitting over on the couch,

725
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and they had a few side-by-side comparisons for The Twilight World,

726
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
where they had it sort of a monochrome color before,

727
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and now they've gone through and touched it up

728
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and added in different sort of ethereal effects to it,

729
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
muted some of the colors, oversaturated some of the other colors

730
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
to give it just a very alien feel when you're in The Twilight World.

731
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And the difference was great.

732
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I mean, of course, I didn't get to see any of The Twilight World,

733
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but I got to see plenty of just the regular world.

734
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Everything had real depth to it.

735
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Instead of just saying, oh, this is 3D,

736
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you actually got a real sense of depth to it.

737
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I actually got a little motion sick.

738
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So that was good.

739
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
All right.

740
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Chat room wants to know, Derek H. is asking, is Scott asleep?

741
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No, not at all.

742
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You've got to be an exhausted guy, though,

743
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
with all this going on here at the E3 Outpost, which is awesome.

744
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
This is a great idea, by the way.

745
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Thanks for having us.

746
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And the E3 and all that other stuff, it's got a long week.

747
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's a little tiring, as you guys know.

748
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I mean, you did the same show I did,

749
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and you've been here just as much as I have.

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So you're tired, too.

751
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But it's all good, because evening is over.

752
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But we get to leave tomorrow.

753
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We do get to leave tomorrow.

754
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
All right.

755
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Scott, your best of show.

756
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I think people are going to be surprised that I love Viva Pinata

757
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
as much as I do.

758
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Wow.

759
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
No, I'm kidding.

760
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, you bastard.

761
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You bastard.

762
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You have me going for a minute.

763
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Not Viva Pinata.

764
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Big shout out to Silent Wind there,

765
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
who has made the trek from Bakersfield.

766
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I tried my damnedest to get him into E3, and I could not do it.

767
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm very sorry about that, Silent Wind.

768
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
No, there's no question in my mind.

769
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You've already said sport is the absolute best game at E3 this year.

770
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Will Wright is a freaking genius.

771
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
We went into that little room, and I thought I knew pretty much

772
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
everything there was to know about the game.

773
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I realized that all the creatures you find in the game

774
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
have essentially been combined with a trading card element

775
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
so that you can print out these trading cards

776
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and play like a Magic the Gathering type game with it

777
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
off the computer completely.

778
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, I had heard.

779
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The stuff they want to do with it is phenomenal,

780
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
those things they were talking about.

781
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
He also had inside the room creatures that were like action figures, statuettes,

782
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and he made them with a 3D printer right from the game,

783
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
which I believe will be possible, to print out your creatures that you create

784
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and make them into figurines that you can have in your room.

785
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The Orange Lounge, when Loki and I went there,

786
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
we aren't cool enough to have Will Wright demo it himself for us,

787
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
so we got some other girl, but she was good.

788
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
We missed out on it.

789
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You went into the little room?

790
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah.

791
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I was surprised.

792
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I was expecting it to be one of Will's minions, a little sim maybe.

793
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
We got a minion.

794
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh, it was great.

795
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I mean, he only showed the kind of third level and space level.

796
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You didn't get to see the kind of amoebic level.

797
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But what I think is so phenomenal about this, and you talked about it,

798
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
sharing the content, you know, anyone who knows SimCity

799
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and the Sims knows that there is, like he says,

800
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
10% of the people who buy those games that make their own stuff,

801
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and of that 10%, there's probably 10% of that that's actually really good.

802
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The fact that instead of having to go to the website,

803
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
look through all the stuff and find it,

804
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
he's taking the best stuff and seeding it into the world on his own,

805
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to me, is the most significant step,

806
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
because as you're playing the game,

807
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
it becomes populated by all this great content,

808
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and so you encounter this creature, you attack this creature,

809
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
you can see who made it, find more of the creatures they've made,

810
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and then the ability to go from amoeba to galactic outside,

811
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
millions of planets.

812
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And when you think about how many units of Sims sold,

813
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and how many units of Spore will sell,

814
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
a lot of game developers will say,

815
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
well, our community will be so big, we'll have so much content,

816
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and usually there's nothing good.

817
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You know that a well-right game will get the audience,

818
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
it'll get the customers, and it'll get the creativity,

819
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and I think we're going to be playing just an incalculable amount

820
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
of creative characters and creatures in this game.

821
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You know, when I was sitting there watching the demo,

822
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I was almost saying, this is too good to be true, this is too ambitious.

823
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But then I remember, oh yeah, there's like 20 Sims Expansions packs,

824
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
so, you know, anything's possible.

825
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah, and I do believe that you're right,

826
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
it is kind of so big that maybe people won't be able to kind of get through it,

827
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and won't be able to get to all elements of it.

828
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But that's kind of what I like about this game,

829
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
is that it is very open and sandboxy,

830
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
so you can just play around and create stuff,

831
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
you can play around in any of the levels,

832
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
but if you're a hardcore gamer,

833
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and you're looking for the more than eight-hour black game experience,

834
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
you know, Spore will deliver probably,

835
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
it'll be on the World of Warcraft scale of gameplay.

836
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I have no doubt it'll do well.

837
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And if it doesn't do well, there's something wrong with the gaming community.

838
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The only, you know, hint that it might not do well,

839
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
is you can look at Sims Online and say,

840
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
well, that was a well-right game, and it didn't do well, so.

841
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah, I guess.

842
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But Sims Online was a dumb idea.

843
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Sims Online just turned into Vegas, it was a bunch of hookers and drugs,

844
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
you know, there's just a couple key things that were wrong with it, unfortunately.

845
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Anyway, let's keep it moving.

846
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Worst game of the show.

847
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Worst game of the show.

848
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Anybody want to start off? Loki?

849
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You know, I almost want to say Africa.

850
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But, since I didn't get to play it,

851
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I didn't really get to play this game either,

852
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I think it's a stupid idea for a game.

853
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The Eye of Judgment.

854
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Worst game ever.

855
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And the reason why is because it's not really a game,

856
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and the fact that it reminds me of something that you would create

857
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
to kind of enhance a Magic the Gathering tournament.

858
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Like something to throw on the TV,

859
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
if you were going to broadcast a Magic the Gathering tournament type thing.

860
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That's about as useful as it is.

861
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The fact that you have to remember to remove cards from the playing field

862
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
so that the PlayStation doesn't accidentally spawn the creature again is stupid.

863
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
My worst game of the show would be found over at 2K Games, this booth.

864
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's the new Family Feud game coming to, what, I think PlayStation 2.

865
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And while granted there might be a market for the Family Feud game,

866
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I had the Family Feud game on the Commodore 64,

867
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and not a goddamn thing has changed.

868
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Why would we need this?

869
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
This is so, I don't know.

870
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The survey says you're right.

871
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
74% said you are correct, it's the worst game of the show.

872
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Survey says this game sucks.

873
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And the hosts have changed so many times.

874
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I mean, if you're going to bring me a Family Feud game,

875
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
at least give me Richard Dawson trying to make out with the chicks.

876
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
They're all on that show.

877
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
At least give me that.

878
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Who's the host? The guy that committed suicide?

879
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No, some random guy.

880
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I know on the real TV show, I think it's the guy from Home Improvement,

881
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
but I guess they couldn't get his likeness for the game.

882
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Too expensive, I bet. His license is huge.

883
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
What a piece of poop.

884
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And to think, that game was next to Dora the Explorer,

885
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and I still named Family Feud.

886
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
All right, Dark Sakura, worst freaking game at E3.

887
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Sonic the Hedgehog.

888
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Which one?

889
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The PS3 one.

890
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, Team Sonic rolling over.

891
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And she is such a Sega fangirl that there must be some atrocities.

892
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The control. The game was pretty.

893
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And I mean, it was really, really pretty,

894
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
except for some of the jaggies on the PS3.

895
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But you know, even the Xbox 360 one,

896
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
because I did go back and check that out,

897
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the control was utter crap.

898
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You turn it just, you know,

899
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
the best controlling version of Sonic Adventure was on the Dreamcast.

900
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It was smooth, it was...

901
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Why couldn't they have taken a page from the Dreamcast?

902
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You know, they do it right.

903
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
They have it to where if you just

904
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
go a little bit to the left, drop the cliff.

905
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And then on top of that, they have them,

906
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
the angle that they have them fall at,

907
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you can see that the platform that you've been standing on

908
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
is just floating in the air.

909
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
He just falls into nothingness.

910
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And as like, if they're at least going to do that,

911
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
have it from an overhead angle, you know,

912
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and have them fade out, you know.

913
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So, I could see there were a few collision detection issues.

914
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The thing is, is that they can do a good Sonic game.

915
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I mean, I played Sonic Rivals, that was fun.

916
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But I have to call it the worst game

917
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
if they take something that I adore so much

918
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and make utter crap out of it.

919
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
All right.

920
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So, it gets worst game on control alone.

921
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm sorry to hear it. All right, Scott.

922
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So am I.

923
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Worst freaking game at E3.

924
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
This time I'm not kidding when I say

925
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
people will be surprised when they hear me say this.

926
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Madden for the PlayStation 3 was the worst game that I played at E3.

927
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I have to tell you, if you're a PlayStation guy, girl,

928
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and you're expecting to pick up a PS3 at launch,

929
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and you're like Madden,

930
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
get ready to go through what we went through last year

931
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
with the Xbox 360 version.

932
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
From the words of an EA Sports employee,

933
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the game will not work right.

934
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
They're just saying they haven't had enough time.

935
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's going to be just like the 360.

936
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
They still don't have final dev kits.

937
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Madden has been completely rebuilt.

938
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And when you rebuild and you try to let people in the house

939
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
you're rebuilding before it's done,

940
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
it's going to feel like it's not done.

941
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And Madden on the 360 wasn't done.

942
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
He acknowledged that.

943
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
He said, you know, you're right, it was broken.

944
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And he said it's going to be the same way this year.

945
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And I would have thought all the work they did

946
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
since the release of the 360 version

947
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
would have carried over to the PS3.

948
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But unfortunately, no.

949
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The best thing about Madden really

950
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
is they've got 3D grass for the first time.

951
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So if you're excited about 3D grass,

952
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you'll be happy with the new Madden.

953
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But otherwise, PS3 Madden,

954
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
it was the worst thing I've played.

955
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It was a joke.

956
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Wow, that's, wow.

957
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Now we don't talk a lot about sports games on this show,

958
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
but even the...

959
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You're allergic, right?

960
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
No, I mean, I like Blades of Steel.

961
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Okay.

962
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I like Tank Metal.

963
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I like NBA Jam.

964
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Those are good games.

965
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Here's the thing, though.

966
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What I'm curious about,

967
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
even the non-sports games fans

968
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
are interested in Madden on the Wii.

969
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm curious, what are your thoughts,

970
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
sports game fan of Madden on the Wii?

971
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Well, I'll tell you,

972
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
all the sports games on the Wii

973
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
are going to benefit from the fact that

974
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
we've been pushing buttons for sports games for years.

975
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I found the novelty

976
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
of using the controllers really enjoyable.

977
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I found it to be a new challenge in the game.

978
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Instead of just adding a vision cone to a game,

979
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I found throwing the ball,

980
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
like using the motion of throwing a ball,

981
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
was really kind of cool,

982
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and it really appealed to me.

983
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I think that they've just kind of begun to tip the iceberg

984
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
of what's possible

985
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
in terms of unique gameplay elements

986
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
with this special controller.

987
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I have to say,

988
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I was surprised that it didn't feel cheesy, gimmicky,

989
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
even at this early stage.

990
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I think graphically it'll be able to be decent enough

991
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
that it won't be a disappointment to people

992
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
who are kind of used to the graphics they have.

993
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But I have to tell you,

994
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I think that if you can lock in the Wii controller

995
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
into the kind of sports games we're used to,

996
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
whether it be hockey from the guys at 2K Sports,

997
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
or baseball from the guys at 2K, or EA even,

998
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and what I'd really like to see is a boxing game use the Wii,

999
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I think people who are sports fans

1000
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
are going to be ready to make this jump.

1001
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because, let's face it,

1002
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
for years we've been playing sports games the exact same way.

1003
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And just watching the guy play baseball with the Wii controller,

1004
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
it made me excited.

1005
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Graphically, I think the Nintendo sports games,

1006
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
they need to evolve a little.

1007
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm a little tired of these cutesy little Japanese characters

1008
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
for my baseball games and my tennis games.

1009
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'd like to see some realistic players here in 2006.

1010
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But the Miyamoto in tennis was hilarious.

1011
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You have to admit it.

1012
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Oh, the faces.

1013
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That was the best part of the press conference.

1014
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Reggie Fils-Aime, Iwata, and Shigeru Miyamoto

1015
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
on the faces of those characters.

1016
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Clearly the show-stealer at the Nintendo press conference.

1017
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Way too cute.

1018
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That was pretty adorable.

1019
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let's go around.

1020
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Best booth, worst.

1021
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Well, let's start with best booth using any criteria you want.

1022
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Best booth using any criteria you want.

1023
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It can be designed, it can be what was in it,

1024
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
it can be the way the staff treated you.

1025
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Any criteria you want.

1026
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Loki.

1027
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I would have to say Sega's booth was probably the best booth

1028
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that I played at, at least.

1029
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I like flat-out, or not flat-out, full-auto, too.

1030
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And I love being able to play multiplayer in ChromeHounds.

1031
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So I think they had a really good setup.

1032
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The videos were everywhere.

1033
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So I liked it, and they were giving away lots of stuff.

1034
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So yeah.

1035
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Dark Sakura, best booth at E3?

1036
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Uh...

1037
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm really not sure, because I wasn't particularly wowed.

1038
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I guess I'm going to, even though I really disliked their layout,

1039
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'd go with Nintendo.

1040
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Just because it was pretty.

1041
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And I did like how they had the...

1042
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You know, I'm actually going to strike that back.

1043
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm going to say the PSP area for Sony.

1044
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Okay, so like the PSP booth?

1045
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I liked the couches.

1046
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You could sit down, and your feet were like,

1047
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm sitting down.

1048
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You know what, the way you played those PSP demos was very interesting.

1049
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I know.

1050
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
That's how I sit on my couch and play, sort of half sideways.

1051
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But I thought that it was a neat...

1052
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It was easy to get to everything.

1053
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You were crowded, like a bunch of rats in a cage.

1054
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It was just all like, I've got room to breathe.

1055
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I can sit down.

1056
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
This is a fabulous idea.

1057
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So yeah, I'm going to actually go with Sony,

1058
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
for just the PSP area.

1059
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
All right.

1060
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Best booth for me.

1061
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

1062
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Because three years ago, this would never...

1063
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Best and this company would have never come out of my mouth.

1064
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But times have changed so much,

1065
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and this year's E3 proved that Microsoft has got the best booth to show.

1066
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I would agree with it.

1067
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Microsoft is in such an interesting position right now,

1068
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
because they do have a year ahead.

1069
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And every problem I had with the Xbox, they got it this time.

1070
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
There is something for the role-playing fans.

1071
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Enchanted Arms looks great.

1072
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
There is something for the cutesy people.

1073
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Viva Pinata.

1074
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Well, okay, maybe there'll be something else next year.

1075
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
There is something for sports people, action people.

1076
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And the way the booth was laid out was smart.

1077
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Their demonstration was inside a little room.

1078
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The Gears of War thing, where the floor vibrated.

1079
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You got your ticket, you came back.

1080
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm sorry, you put headphones on.

1081
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm just so excited.

1082
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
But Microsoft, the people would come up and talk to you.

1083
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Did not judge you based on your credentials.

1084
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Were happy and excited to tell you about the game.

1085
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm so surprised at how far Microsoft has come.

1086
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
By far and above the best booth in E3 2016.

1087
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I actually do have to agree with you there,

1088
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
because I was impressed with the area they had laid out for DDR.

1089
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
They gave you enough space to play that you're not face-up in front of the TV.

1090
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
They sure did.

1091
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And also, Matt was actually pretty...

1092
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
At the end of the show, they had these people walking around taking photos

1093
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and attaching it like little Polaroids and attaching it in a frame.

1094
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I talked to one of the girls over there.

1095
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
She was just as friendly as she could be.

1096
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
She said, oh yeah, Method Man just came by here

1097
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and talking about how some of the less savory people there.

1098
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We both agreed that we just like Pierce Hilton.

1099
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And now the chat room is getting a little angsty at me naming Microsoft,

1100
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
because I think there's a lot of people still in that area

1101
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
where they don't want to go over the Microsoft products yet,

1102
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
because Microsoft hasn't done enough outside the realm of sports

1103
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and driving and stuff that's won them over yet.

1104
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm telling you guys, they're on the right path.

1105
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And don't get me wrong, there's even nice things about the PlayStation 3

1106
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
and of course about the Wii.

1107
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But Microsoft is really in a good position right now,

1108
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and the booth itself was great.

1109
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It was not packed like it was a couple of years ago,

1110
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
because they were more intelligent about where they put everything.

1111
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So it was easier to access things.

1112
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Just on all those levels, I'm considering it.

1113
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's just great.

1114
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Scott. Oh, Scott took his headphones off.

1115
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm sorry, are you on your way out?

1116
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
No, no, I just got an emergency phone call

1117
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
just to tell me that they love the show.

1118
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Oh, thank you.

1119
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
They were just calling in, they said,

1120
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I love the show that you guys are doing, keep it up.

1121
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Thank you, whoever that was, hello and thank you, appreciate it.

1122
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
They're enjoying it.

1123
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
All right, best freaking booth at E3.

1124
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I agree, Microsoft's booth was very good.

1125
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But it is, to me, hard to deny what EA is able to put together each year.

1126
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's more about that Thunderdome and the way they put together that video.

1127
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It is kind of a lot of responsibility to be the first thing people see

1128
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
when they walk into the big south hall.

1129
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And I think that EA, over the years, has evolved that booth.

1130
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's very easy to see all of their games on display.

1131
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
There's some stuff behind closed doors,

1132
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
but the way it's set up with that circular movie room

1133
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
so you can see all the movies,

1134
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
game stations all on the inside,

1135
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
a lot of playable stuff right on the inside.

1136
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And then outside on that outer perimeter,

1137
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
again, very big, clear game stations.

1138
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
For example, Superman today,

1139
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I was expecting not to be able to get any kind of demo,

1140
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but I stood there, watched him give a great demo to one person,

1141
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
then he left and I got to get up close and ask a lot of questions.

1142
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And I just think that they've designed it really well.

1143
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's clean, the way it's laid out.

1144
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I went into the little private area room with the NFL Network

1145
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and even back there, it was very nice.

1146
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The people were friendly,

1147
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and I just found that to be a good job.

1148
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And for God's sake, it better be.

1149
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
They've got all the money in the world,

1150
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
they've got a lot of big AAA titles,

1151
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and they've got the best spot in the entire show,

1152
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
better than even the big three.

1153
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So I have to say, I thought the EA booth...

1154
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Now, I did want to jump quickly back to your earlier question

1155
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
about most surprising,

1156
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,000
because I remembered something that's right up the OLR alley in Kensha Hall.

1157
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I was checking out the Novant controller,

1158
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
but across from them was a booth showing off

1159
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
the world's first massively multiplayer DDR game.

1160
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I thought that was interesting.

1161
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I mean, it's too bad I couldn't understand it

1162
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
because it was all in different language.

1163
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But I looked at it and I went, hmm, that's interesting.

1164
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I mean, I was shocked.

1165
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I was like, wow, there are people dancing together online all over the world.

1166
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I thought that was kind of shocking, surprising, and weird.

1167
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
All right.

1168
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
We've got to move it really quickly through these last couple topics

1169
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
because we've got to make way for All Games Interactive,

1170
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
which is coming up next, correct?

1171
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It is.

1172
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
All right.

1173
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Well, let's real quickly, worst booth and why.

1174
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Worst booth?

1175
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
That's really hard for me to say

1176
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
because honestly the worst booth as far as its showing went

1177
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
was I was really underwhelmed also by the PS3 area.

1178
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Sony overall gets best and worst.

1179
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Okay.

1180
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
They get best for layout, worst for games.

1181
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I mean, true, they did have Tekken and Ghosts and Goblins,

1182
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
but when you went up to the PS3 area,

1183
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I was surrounded by so much crap that it literally stank

1184
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
and I had to get out of there.

1185
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
All right.

1186
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Loki, worst booth?

1187
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Nintendo.

1188
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Why?

1189
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Nintendo's booth, you had to wait in a four-hour line

1190
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
to get into another booth to where you'd wait another hour to play a game.

1191
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So it was a line to wait in another line to wait to play some games,

1192
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
which were just tech demos,

1193
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and then the jackasses that were working on the demos there,

1194
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
five minutes made quick, that type of stuff.

1195
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It was just very hurried.

1196
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
They let people in, people weren't leaving,

1197
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
so there's hundreds of people moshed in there like a club or something.

1198
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It just wasn't very conducive to being able to play the games.

1199
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
The DS stations, as Bobby mentioned earlier,

1200
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
none of the games were marked with what games they were.

1201
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
You had to actually look over people's shoulders to see what they were playing,

1202
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
which was stupid.

1203
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
No GameCube games on the floor,

1204
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
including the fact that they announced a couple games,

1205
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
like the new Paper Mario game, which I wanted to play.

1206
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
What else could be wrong?

1207
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
No Game Boy Advance, but I don't really miss that.

1208
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
One booth had Game Boy Advance games.

1209
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That was SNK, which was like one game.

1210
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But not even Nintendo was showing it, so let's do that.

1211
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I actually am really surprised that you said they were being rude

1212
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
because the people I dealt with at Nintendo were nothing but brilliantly nice.

1213
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Actually, I had really nice people too.

1214
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
That girl got me a Koji Kono's autograph,

1215
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and then the guy who was there at Zelda,

1216
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
he was all helping me out with some of the controls until I got used to it.

1217
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
We were just talking about old games and everything.

1218
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It was great. He was a really nice guy.

1219
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
The one I was talking about in particular was the Red Steel demo.

1220
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It was a shift change.

1221
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The guy before him was letting these people play for 15 minutes each,

1222
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
and then when I got up there, he was like, okay, five minutes, make it quick.

1223
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Wow.

1224
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I would also say Nintendo was the worst booth at E3,

1225
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and don't get me wrong, I love the Wii.

1226
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I mean, I'm going to buy the Wii.

1227
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I think it's awesome, but the design of the booth was shit

1228
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
because when they did the DS, it was so much better.

1229
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You go in, they show the preview.

1230
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
They have a set amount of time that you get to spend with the demos,

1231
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and there's incentive to go back through

1232
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because you may get to go to the demo room that has even more demos.

1233
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It was much smarter made that year.

1234
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I'm pissed that they didn't show anything on GameCube

1235
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
because that Super Paper Mario, whatever it was, looks awesome,

1236
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and it's a crime that that wasn't on the floor.

1237
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's sad that they're ignoring the advance

1238
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
when they were pushing the micro so hard last year.

1239
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Nintendo made some...

1240
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Whoever designed Nintendo's booth should be fired for E307.

1241
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Bring back the old booth. Honestly, it was better.

1242
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And it's sad I'm making that judgment, not even based on the content.

1243
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And the fact that I dealt with some very nice people at Nintendo, it's too bad,

1244
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
but the booth design cannot be ignored.

1245
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It was a horrible way to show the Wii.

1246
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Scott, worst booth.

1247
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Let's see, worst booth.

1248
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
There's so many to choose from.

1249
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It's very difficult because I found a lot of these booths

1250
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
to be poorly designed, poorly laid out,

1251
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
poor choice of costume people.

1252
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You know, I think I'm going to say...

1253
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm going to say, I'm going to agree with you guys

1254
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
that Nintendo was poorly designed.

1255
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I think they were in a tough position

1256
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
because they knew everyone that goes to E307.

1257
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
There's no way you leave E307

1258
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
without having to at least try to try the Wii

1259
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
because there's only, what, PC, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Microsoft,

1260
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and if you were to go back and people would say,

1261
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
wow, you heard about this crazy controller, did you play it?

1262
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And you said, no, you're kind of a loser.

1263
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And the fact that they made it so difficult

1264
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and the fact that they didn't show a lot of the stuff

1265
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that people wanted to see,

1266
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
yeah, I mean, you've got to say boo to Nintendo.

1267
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Boo.

1268
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Sorry, you know, I still consider myself a Nintendo fanboy.

1269
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Well, really, I'm a gaming fanboy. I like them all.

1270
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
But Nintendo, that booth design, fire the architect.

1271
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Fire him.

1272
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Bobby wanted to interject something real quick.

1273
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Did anybody here say LucasArts?

1274
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Oh, no.

1275
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That's my runner-up.

1276
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's my runner-up.

1277
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
What are you hiding, LucasArts?

1278
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Who kept their booth closed for two days, then opened it up with a line.

1279
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Two and a half days.

1280
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They opened it up at noon today, then it was a line.

1281
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Who cares about LucasArts after that point?

1282
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It looked like it was a museum in there,

1283
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
which means it was nothing more than a George Lucas ego inflation thing.

1284
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah, but they had a video of people that worked there going,

1285
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
the next generation...

1286
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
What was the line? There was something about...

1287
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
We will make the next generation game.

1288
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
No, the video wall when you're walking towards West Hall.

1289
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Well, why don't you make it outside where we can see it?

1290
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Does that mean they haven't done crap yet?

1291
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah, they always do that.

1292
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That's an elitist mentality, and that's LucasArts.

1293
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I actually have a category I'd like to ask everyone about.

1294
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Really quick, what was the most bizarre thing you saw?

1295
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The line of people to see Paris Hilton, get out of my E3.

1296
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Get out. What are you people doing there?

1297
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It is not a celebrity gawk fest.

1298
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Loki?

1299
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
The strangest thing I saw...

1300
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I would have to say, because there wasn't too much weird stuff,

1301
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but at the very end as we were walking out,

1302
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
there was some impromptu dance party going on in the Engage booth,

1303
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and I don't know what that was about.

1304
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That was horrible.

1305
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Despite the fact I bashed on the Engage an awful lot,

1306
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
their booth was actually pretty slick.

1307
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I couldn't go in. It was almost like I was Superman and it was Kryptonite.

1308
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I would try to walk towards the Engage booth,

1309
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and I physically was pushed backwards.

1310
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I used it to cut through to get around the massive Konami,

1311
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
people watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer.

1312
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
But you know what? The booth design was slick.

1313
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I still hate the Engage, but the design is slick.

1314
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
They tried to sell it really well.

1315
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You're reminding me too much of the Apple Store.

1316
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Alright, you.

1317
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
My most bizarre thing was WTF.

1318
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Oh, yeah, the work task fund or whatever.

1319
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Work time fund.

1320
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
That's just because it's something really bizarre about cutting a rabbit in half

1321
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
and then having this old lady bring out incense and start praying

1322
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and getting paid for it.

1323
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Alright.

1324
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Scott, really quickly, you got one you want to add?

1325
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Okay, my weird thing was two things.

1326
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
One, those stupid inflatable rafts people were wearing on the back.

1327
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
To see people in suits walking around with webs and inflatable rafts on their back,

1328
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I just wanted to push them so that they'd fall and bounce and bounce back up.

1329
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I just wanted to do that all day.

1330
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Worst giveaway I've ever seen.

1331
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And the other thing is these hordes of people that stand in line for ridiculous things.

1332
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Now, okay, I like Adam West.

1333
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I just don't understand wasting.

1334
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
The show is three days.

1335
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Two and three quarters because the last day is short.

1336
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Why are people spending their time waiting in lines,

1337
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
A, to see old celebrities or even like a Paris Hilton, like you said,

1338
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and B, to get a small little trinket of something that you will probably lose very quickly

1339
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
or never use in your life.

1340
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
If it's something cool, I'm all about it.

1341
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But I see people waiting as though they're going to receive communion from the pope or something.

1342
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's just very, very bizarre.

1343
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Along the same lines, why do they go stand behind G4's booth to try and get on TV?

1344
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Like every day we were leaving, we'd see this crowd of people going,

1345
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And just to let you in on a little secret, I actually walked by and went,

1346
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Boo!

1347
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I mean, it's just weird.

1348
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm petty, I'm sorry.

1349
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You know I don't like the direction that channel went into.

1350
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Why are people going to the G4 booth at E3 to watch coverage of E3?

1351
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I know, I know. Anyway, we've got to wrap it up.

1352
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Thank you guys. This was a great show.

1353
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Scott Rubin, thank you so much for joining us on tonight's program.

1354
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You guys are welcome back here anytime, any day.

1355
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's been a pleasure to have. It's been a lot of fun.

1356
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And like I said to you earlier before the show,

1357
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
anybody who's got a passion for gaming,

1358
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
and you guys have been doing this show so long,

1359
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
it's a real testament to your passion for gaming,

1360
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and your audience is a lucky group of people,

1361
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and I'm glad the All Games crew has had a chance to experience OLR live from E3.

1362
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Thank you.

1363
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And you know what, Scott?

1364
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Thank you so much.

1365
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You know, I would have never thought having four years ago

1366
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
that we would be sitting here with somebody who has been to the ends of gaming media,

1367
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
you know, on the TV and stuff.

1368
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
This is surreal.

1369
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Thank you so much for having us.

1370
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
This is awesome.

1371
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Thanks for coming.

1372
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
All right.

1373
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Bobby, thank you so much for being here as well.

1374
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We appreciate it, your three days of hard work on the program.

1375
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yeah, well, no, actually, and what I wanted to say is, you know,

1376
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
that I really appreciate being here.

1377
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
A lot of your people listening probably don't know.

1378
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I was listening to Orange Lounge Radio before they started podcasting.

1379
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I had listened to some of their live shows before the whole podcasting fact,

1380
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and then I was listening to their podcast before I was doing a show.

1381
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So for me as a fan, it's been a thrill to be able to be up here with the guys.

1382
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
A lot of listeners probably would kill to have, you know,

1383
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
be able to sit at least for one show.

1384
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I got two.

1385
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I got two shows with the OLR guys.

1386
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So thank you, and thank you to the OLR chatters for welcoming me and the family.

1387
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It was kind of really weird today when people were asking me,

1388
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
please be on the show again today.

1389
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Move to Sacramento.

1390
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
We'll talk about it.

1391
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
All right.

1392
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
All right.

1393
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Thank you.

1394
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I really would like to thank our OLR me for showing up in force.

1395
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, you guys are awesome.

1396
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I was very impressed to see so many people.

1397
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And it was cool to meet some of you at E3 also.

1398
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah, I met up with a few people.

1399
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And Justin.

1400
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Oh, my gosh.

1401
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, my gosh, Justin.

1402
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
You don't even know how bad I owe you.

1403
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Bandit in chat says, support all games.

1404
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Kill G4, damn posers.

1405
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Interesting comment.

1406
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You know what?

1407
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
If you want the real gaming media, you're going to have to go to the internet.

1408
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I agree with that.

1409
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
All right.

1410
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Let's wrap it up.

1411
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Final, final thoughts.

1412
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Final thoughts of E3.

1413
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Scott, do you want to get indulged with the final thought?

1414
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Final thoughts of E3, you know, every year we get very excited looking up to it.

1415
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I think this year, because it is a transition year, I think I'm so shocked at how disappointing

1416
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Sony's showing was that I almost don't feel the same as I ever have, believing in E3 before.

1417
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Obviously, those movies last year left us on such a high point.

1418
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We couldn't believe it.

1419
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Is it real?

1420
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Is it real?

1421
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
In this year, the reality feels like a really wet towel smacking me in the face.

1422
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But being a guy that went out and got a 360, it just kind of shows that sometimes when

1423
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
you are there on day one to adopt a new technology, it pays off in the end.

1424
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And so I'm glad I have a next-gen system.

1425
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I don't feel like I got burnt.

1426
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And hopefully Sony will surprise us when they release this machine in November.

1427
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
All right.

1428
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Bobby, final thought.

1429
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm ready to go home.

1430
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Loki, final thought.

1431
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Man, this is weird.

1432
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I don't really want to leave here, because I swear, having come here like every day this

1433
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
week, it feels like a second home almost.

1434
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It's just, I don't know.

1435
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I need more plasma screens in my house, I think.

1436
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Your new wife missed you.

1437
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
That was the first thing we did when we moved into our house.

1438
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I haven't seen this kind of emotion from him all week.

1439
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I know.

1440
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
This is crazy.

1441
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
All right.

1442
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Well, I'm sorry.

1443
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I've been kind of buried in a laptop all week.

1444
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You really have.

1445
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
But E3 on PSP, how's that been?

1446
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
A success?

1447
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Did you call it a success?

1448
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's as good as one person can do, so.

1449
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
There you go.

1450
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Maybe next year we'll have a set.

1451
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Next year you'll have a bigger crew.

1452
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
All right.

1453
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
My final thought, and then we'll let Dark Sakura go.

1454
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
My final thought would be, I was dissing on the chat room earlier, but secretly, I love

1455
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
you guys.

1456
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You guys are the reason why we do this show.

1457
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I mean, not just chatters, but listeners in general.

1458
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I mean, just the feedback and the positive support we've gotten is just amazing.

1459
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So, thank you so much.

1460
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And that's that.

1461
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
We'll see you at E307.

1462
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Dark Sakura.

1463
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Rejects false icons.

1464
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Say no to Sony.

1465
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
All right.

1466
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Wow.

1467
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
That's some harsh words.

1468
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I don't know.

1469
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I don't hate Sony, but we'll get into that on another show.

1470
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
But not next week.

1471
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
No OLR this Sunday.

1472
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
We will be back next Sunday.

1473
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000

1474

1475
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
For those of you guys listening on the podcast, we will be back the week after Sunday.

1476
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And say hello to your mother or your motherly figure for us.

1477
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
We are out.

1478
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Goodbye, E3.

1479
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Goodbye.

1480
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
