00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:18,922
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live at the E3 Outpost for this Friday, 2006 E3 edition.

2
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, everybody, to the Friday edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:43,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We are here live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles, where we've been taping our post-E3 shows all week long.

4
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:45,058
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,158
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky.

6
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, what up?

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, TechMassaLoki.

9
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:53,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

10
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:54,243
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

11
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:58,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And moseying his way on over to a microphone there, joining us for...

12
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:07,554
[SPEAKER_05]: This last of our E3 shows is the one and only Bobby Blackwool, who has no microphone right now.

13
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:08,454
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

14
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:11,216
[SPEAKER_05]: We have mic troubles.

15
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:11,696
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

16
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:12,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio, boys and girls.

17
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I think... It's coming.

18
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,319
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

19
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:16,779
[SPEAKER_05]: There you are.

20
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:17,240
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, once again, wave hello to producer Lawrence Young, who's over there in the corner.

22
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,005
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I wish we could take him back to Sacramento with us.

23
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,165
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been awesome all week long.

24
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:27,006
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

25
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,019
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some Smash Brothers still going on.

26
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart Double Dash.

27
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:55,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think people would be sick of games by the end of this show.

28
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Fight Night Round 3.

29
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:59,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we even had Rampage Total Destruction.

30
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:00,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, awesome.

31
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:02,578
[SPEAKER_05]: They have black going on on one of the TVs over there.

32
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:03,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you guys, but I think I might be sick of games after today.

34
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:08,964
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

35
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:11,946
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I'll go right back home and play games again, but boy, overload.

36
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, do you have a fever?

37
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you feeling okay?

38
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:15,410
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

39
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:16,998
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's great.

40
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, it's exhausting.

41
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:25,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of people sitting at home are probably screaming at me going, Sky, you ungrateful bastard, at least you get to go to E3.

42
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, trust me, I don't take that for granted.

43
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very lucky to be able to go, but it is very tiring.

44
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:33,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you were here, you'd say the same thing as like, shit, I'm exhausted.

45
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:40,666
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm craving some Ridge Racer 6 since they didn't have Ridge Racer 7 at PlayStation or Namco's booth this year, except for a video.

46
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:42,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, kind of disappointing, huh?

47
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:44,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I'm craving it, it's just...

48
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:45,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Need to play it.

49
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The Craven is there.

50
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:46,908
[SPEAKER_05]: The Itch is there.

51
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm craving tacos.

52
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:52,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick programming note, you guys, for you Orange Lounge Radio fans.

53
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,191
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no live program this Sunday, which is Mother's Day.

54
00:02:56,892 --> 00:03:01,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So spend some extra time with your mother or motherly figure in your life.

55
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:03,054
[SPEAKER_05]: The politically correct term there.

56
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:21,146
[SPEAKER_05]: or catch up on the three podcasts that we had there you go unfortunately we've just we got other stuff going on due to the holiday and you know just the fact that we're driving home from E3 and all that so we hope our listeners will understand but we'll be back of course our normal time next Sunday we're just burnt out from the week

57
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:22,607
[SPEAKER_03]: A little wee?

58
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:23,267
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

59
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I plan on playing that new game, Extreme Nap Action.

60
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,610
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

61
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to the chat room there over at www... I'm sorry, chat.allgames.com tonight.

62
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so used to plugging the other room.

63
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, we're chat.allgames.com.

64
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:41,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, we'll be back to the Orange Lounge Radio chat over at orangeloungeradio.com.

65
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,721
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always interact with us on our forums over there as well.

66
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:45,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Reading chat right now, let's see.

67
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:50,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Jada2006 says, LOL, there are so many video games.

68
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,426
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you get sick of them?

69
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:53,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

70
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Get back and read the first part of your sentence and then ask that again.

71
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,275
[SPEAKER_05]: With so many video games comes so much walking and so many lines, including those for food.

72
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry to tell you.

73
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:06,617
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

74
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:07,078
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

75
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:09,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't have a really long line for food.

76
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:11,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It was much better this year.

77
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:12,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only for coffee.

78
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I will hand it off to the expo.

79
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,438
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a much better job with food this year than last year.

80
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:18,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was because of the Wii line.

81
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody was in that.

82
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:23,527
[SPEAKER_02]: The long lines were for the grill and everything.

83
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:24,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, sandwich tuna.

84
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,532
[SPEAKER_05]: They had much more... Excuse me.

85
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:33,012
[SPEAKER_05]: They have much more stuff set up outside this year, which I thought was smart.

86
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:36,615
[SPEAKER_05]: They had like the barbecue grills, like you were kind of saying, and all that stuff.

87
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think people started bringing food too, which is also smart.

88
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,279
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some really healthy selections this time around.

89
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very pleased because, you know, I don't do the meat thing.

90
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:45,182
[SPEAKER_02]: They had tuna.

91
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to hear it.

92
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:48,765
[SPEAKER_02]: They had bagels and coffee.

93
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of coffee for me this weekend, this week.

94
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:58,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and play two interesting things tonight, because we have other topics we want to get to, so we can't do three.

95
00:04:58,283 --> 00:04:59,804
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do two interesting things tonight.

96
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:03,106
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, two interesting things you saw at the show today.

97
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:03,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Start with one.

98
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:10,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had it in my head, and it was in that issue of EGM I'd been reading down there, and I completely forgot what it was.

99
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to say X Steel by NCSoft.

100
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very, very interesting.

101
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:21,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like virtual on.

102
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot more, and it's going to be a free game.

103
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:28,523
[SPEAKER_02]: A free download, free game through PlayNC.

104
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:29,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I like free.

105
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:30,925
[SPEAKER_05]: My ears perk up when I hear free.

106
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a whole series of games.

107
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:35,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Runner, there was Smash Star, which they're going to rename.

108
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:36,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already out in Korea.

109
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And Soccer Fury, which was very, very detailed.

110
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like hardcore, beat everyone up soccer.

111
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

112
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't beat the price of free.

113
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,985
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you enjoy the tour over there at that booth?

114
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:52,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

115
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,491
[SPEAKER_02]: The Guild Wars woman was actually sort of like, maybe I should play Guild Wars.

116
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because you've bashed Guild Wars on this show before.

117
00:05:58,094 --> 00:06:02,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily bashed, it just wasn't fun for me when I played it before.

118
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually better than that, I'm actually considering trying Tabula Rasa.

119
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

120
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I like the whole sci-fi, kill aliens, shoot things fun.

121
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:15,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Guild Wars fans will be happy to hear the new expansions winning people over.

122
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we're playing two interesting things.

123
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:19,478
[SPEAKER_05]: What's one of your two?

124
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:23,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, you know, I've been so lazy today.

125
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:26,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I played a lot of things today, but I don't remember half the stuff I played.

126
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:28,003
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

127
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

128
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:35,135
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to cheat, tell them something from Wednesday or Thursday that we haven't talked about yet and they won't know the difference.

129
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:35,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

130
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:41,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I played... What was it?

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Spore.

132
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Spore was huge.

133
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:47,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just an awesome looking game.

134
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:50,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really much more I can say.

135
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:55,889
[SPEAKER_03]: If you watch the Game Developers Conference video of it, it's basically that.

136
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those games where...

137
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:03,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to sit there and destroy everything.

138
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:09,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Create a race of vicious aliens that go and just decimate everything.

139
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:10,578
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm doing with Spore.

140
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved Spore.

141
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Loved it.

142
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was surprised.

143
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:19,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know much about it going into the show today.

144
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:22,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's a lot of buzz, but I'm only one guy.

145
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't follow everything.

146
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to go see it because of the buzz.

147
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:30,051
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't go there.

148
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:38,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally got into the Spore thing, and it was much more than anyone could possibly expect.

149
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:50,703
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't been following this game, there is so much to it, and so much of it has to do with the user, the way you build things, and the way people that you know and random strangers in the universe build things.

150
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It is so phenomenally impressive.

151
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:55,846
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be the next Sims, honestly.

152
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:57,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is not surprising.

153
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's Will Wright, but...

154
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.

155
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be very interested to see if something like this comes out on a console, too, because I know right now it's only PC, right?

156
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:15,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just PC, but... They're saying DS and PSP as well, but... There was a job posting about porting Spore to the DS.

157
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:17,055
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

158
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:21,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a bastardized version, though, like those Sims.

159
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:26,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It should really be on the 360, or something that's really connected to the internet all the time.

160
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

161
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,308
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii.

162
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:29,908
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

163
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, what's one of two interesting things you saw today at E3?

164
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:41,999
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a surprising one because I'm like sitting here, you know, Nintendo fanboy and stuff and, you know, really bashing on Sony.

165
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting that I actually enjoyed Warhawk.

166
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:47,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

167
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:52,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played it all ready to be able to be all bashing it and all that stuff.

168
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:53,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I was having fun.

169
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:55,830
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly was the demo like?

170
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,750
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you do in the demo?

171
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,931
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a single player and a multiplayer demo.

172
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,432
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did the single player demo just because it was near the end of the show.

173
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:08,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, you just flew around shooting planes and then you had to shoot down four frigates.

174
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:12,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The control scheme, it was no different.

175
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:14,717
[SPEAKER_04]: For the people who are listening to radio, you can't see me doing this.

176
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:20,099
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've ever made a plane with your hand and just flown around and made the noise, we all did that as kids.

177
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:22,100
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it felt like I was doing.

178
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,500
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I was flying the plane.

179
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:30,242
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nothing innovative or new, but it was fun.

180
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:37,445
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics probably could have been better a little bit, but the game was fun and I was not expecting that going into it.

181
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

182
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:44,855
[SPEAKER_05]: The lines for Warhawk, when I wanted to try and see it, were really, really long, so I didn't really get a chance to do it.

183
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:48,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I waited until the end of the last day, and there was like two people in front of me.

184
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:51,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask, the controller, how did that feel?

185
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,141
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that, that tilt controller?

186
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:55,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fine.

187
00:09:55,502 --> 00:10:00,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very responsive on the movements for the plane, and it felt light.

188
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little light controller, and it felt fine.

189
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just got some accelerometers in it.

190
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,150
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that it's really got.

191
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

192
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:20,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay, uh, one interesting thing I saw today, or I should say one interesting experience was, thanks to a listener of Orange Lounge Radio, I got to cut the Wii line.

193
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:22,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

194
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:23,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii!

195
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii, exactly, that's why I said Wii!

196
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,748
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Justin...

197
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:42,797
[SPEAKER_05]: from Vegas, if you're out there listening, I owe you my first born, except I don't have a uterus, so I don't know how it's gonna work, but I owe you so big, thank you so much, I mean, it was totally like a chance thing, we literally ran into each other, and he's like, I'm gonna go see the Wii, and I think I get to cut in line, you wanna come with me?

198
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:43,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, fuck yeah!

199
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:50,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went over, and sure enough, he talked to his person, Strange Scott Pohl, we were able to go in there, I was very happy.

200
00:10:50,422 --> 00:11:11,618
[SPEAKER_05]: The downside to that is, is that once you get in there, it's still a bitch to actually get to play any of the demos, so we just got to cut that four hour line to wait to get in there, so we didn't really get to, we still had to wait in the lines once we got in there to play stuff, so I will say, I thought, well, I guess that whole experience is interesting, but while I have the Wii brought up, this is what I played, I played Excite Truck,

201
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,240
[SPEAKER_05]: which I thought was more fun than it looked in the preview.

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was a fun time.

203
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:21,863
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics are nothing to scream at, but I mean, all the games are widescreen, which made me very happy.

204
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,983
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's good.

205
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a step up for Nintendo.

206
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, WarioWare, which was great.

207
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:33,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little tough at first because you have to keep changing the controller's positions, but you get used to it.

208
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought it was really cute.

209
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played the tennis thing as well, which I sucked at just in...

210
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to be back somewhere else.

211
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad, that was actually the only one I had any interest in playing and I got right up there, it was great.

212
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:56,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky you, lucky you.

213
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:03,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got right up there too, but I had a guy help me get up there too, so we had the same experience on that one.

214
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:14,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's do one more interesting thing and then we'll get into some of the best and worst of E3, like best booth, best games, all that good stuff.

215
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:15,911
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, one more interesting thing.

216
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:17,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw something that made me cry.

217
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:18,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

218
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:44,088
[SPEAKER_02]: That Bomberman Zero thing Ah, Bomberman Zero That was awful I mean, yeah, it plays like Bomberman But it's too hardcore looking And Bomberman's supposed to be cute I remember seeing those old Hudson Japanese commercials Where the person dressed up in the giant Bomberman suit Running all over the place Being chased by the person in the other suit Did you play the Bomberman game on the Wii?

219
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,551
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't get to They had that thing tucked away in the corner

220
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,901
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 Elite Beat Agent

221
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy-ass storylines.

222
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,042
[SPEAKER_05]: This topic came up on Bobby's show earlier.

223
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:20,904
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that have no idea what the F this game is, what is this all about?

224
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:25,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, originally it came out as, I think, Oiden in Japan.

225
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:38,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I gathered, because I wasn't quite paying attention to the storyline, trying to figure out how to play, there's these three guys that just come and basically fix situations.

226
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:39,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's this guy...

227
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: This girl, the babysitter, who was trying to ask her boyfriend to go study with her.

228
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the mom comes and makes her babysit.

229
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:54,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So the elite beat agents come to entertain the children to get them to go to bed.

230
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:58,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's got like this art style and kind of a storyline like...

231
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,040
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

232
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

233
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining us, taking Bobby's place momentarily.

234
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can take Bobby's place.

235
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:33,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe two of me.

236
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:35,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no.

237
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:42,165
[SPEAKER_05]: We love Bobby, but he just did a live show from the Outpost, which you can check out at allgames.com.

238
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,246
[SPEAKER_05]: They're rebroadcasting on Sunday, right?

239
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:45,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

240
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:48,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Your show will rebroadcast on Sunday, or will you be doing another show?

241
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:51,158
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not going to do another show.

242
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:51,658
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

243
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:53,178
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done for the week.

244
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:54,379
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a mom he's got to visit.

245
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:54,999
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

246
00:14:55,419 --> 00:15:00,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So say hello to Scott Rubin, who's joining us from All Games Interactive, which airs here on All Games.

247
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:05,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you guys might know Scott from his days at G4 Television.

248
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:06,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

249
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:08,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were on a show there, G4TV.com.

250
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:09,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

251
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:12,366
[SPEAKER_01]: The show named after a website named after a TV show.

252
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:12,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

253
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:14,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Named after a TV network.

254
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:14,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

255
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:19,171
[SPEAKER_01]: The brilliant genius mind behind that was actually the CEO of the network.

256
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:29,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to call it All Game something, and he was like, no, why don't we name it after the website so that we can promote the website on the show.

257
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,762
[SPEAKER_01]: No hard feelings though, right?

258
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:31,182
[SPEAKER_01]: None.

259
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:31,523
[SPEAKER_01]: None.

260
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:46,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually saw him, I was at E3 on Thursday, sitting at the Sony booth, getting ready to come here, and one of the sales guys from G4 saw me and said, hey, by the way, I just want to let you know, Charles is nearby, Charles Hirshhorn, the guy that...

261
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:56,454
[SPEAKER_01]: and Charles, you know, whatever, he got the network up, but he kind of ruined a lot of the fun, creative stuff that people wanted to do, so it was a very awkward moment, I thought I'd share that with you.

262
00:15:56,474 --> 00:16:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll say it, since I don't know if you, I'll say it, G4 went totally down the toilet, I mean, we get guys, what is that?

263
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:13,301
[SPEAKER_01]: We get guys is a slogan that used to be the main slogan for West Hollywood here in California.

264
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:17,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And they still get guys, so G4 is hoping that some of that will rub off.

265
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:19,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, more power to them.

266
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

267
00:16:20,402 --> 00:16:20,883
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

268
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:26,831
[SPEAKER_05]: But as a gay guy who's been to West Hollywood, I'll say still not interested.

269
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:27,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Still not interested.

270
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,736
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't even win over the gays, so sorry.

271
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, seriously though, Scott, we've been playing a game here, Interesting Things You Saw at E3.

272
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:39,867
[SPEAKER_05]: What was one interesting thing you saw at E3 today?

273
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting thing I saw at E3?

274
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:44,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting can be a game, it can be something you saw, anything.

275
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:48,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll tell you, it is an interesting thing I see at every E3.

276
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:49,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is going to sound mean.

277
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to make it sound mean, but it seems like if you're...

278
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Paralyzed or quadriplegic, you get into E3.

279
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:02,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I see lots of people in wheelchairs that are not moving a lot.

280
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:05,589
[SPEAKER_01]: They have almost no use of their arms and legs.

281
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:11,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe they work for retailers or the media, but somehow they seem to get in.

282
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:14,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them even look very young under the 18 age limit.

283
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, now that could be like a make-a-wish thing.

284
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:18,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree.

285
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:19,915
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just, you said something.

286
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it is interesting.

287
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:23,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting commentary.

288
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:26,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, obviously, I'm not saying anything about it.

289
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:44,161
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, some of my favorite moments have been at E3, especially when I was on the air at G4, where I would be approached by a family, reeling a family member, and they would say to us that he watches the show all the time, he's a really big fan, and

290
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:44,761
[SPEAKER_01]: and many more.

291
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:06,416
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be anyone, literally, when you play games.

292
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:15,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always nice to see people who love games and can get a chance to kind of get close to the industry like that and see how they experience it.

293
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:18,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is, I mean, you guys have been to E3 before.

294
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:21,006
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you kind of take it for granted after a while.

295
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:21,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

296
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:22,747
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is fascinating.

297
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:29,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I watched a couple of people come in just the past couple of days and their eyes light up as if they've entered Disneyland.

298
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:30,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was me the first year.

299
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, DarkSakura, was that you the first year?

300
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:40,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I had sort of an idea of what to expect because my friend, who's another GameStop manager, he brings us a video every year.

301
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:48,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So I sort of had an idea of what to expect, but my first time going and seeing everything so big, I was like, where to first?

302
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:50,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was overwhelming the first year.

303
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:51,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Which meant that...

304
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Camping out at Konami for two hours.

305
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:54,414
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have a plan.

306
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:55,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that.

307
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,076
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have a plan.

308
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,437
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have comfortable shoes.

309
00:18:57,777 --> 00:18:58,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.

310
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you've really got to have a plan.

311
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:03,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I have not been a part of your live broadcast before.

312
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Sky refusing to look at chat.

313
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:10,248
[SPEAKER_01]: He refuses to acknowledge the people in the chat room.

314
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, they're there.

315
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:13,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're just not saying anything interesting.

316
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And, Loki, you also, you don't even bring chat up.

317
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:17,654
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

318
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:18,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki doesn't even.

319
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:19,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually I do.

320
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:20,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki hates the chatters.

321
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:21,879
[SPEAKER_01]: He hates the chatters.

322
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not quite an actual Wonder Woman outfit.

323
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,645
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a Wonder Woman outfit?

324
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, because that's a bikini.

325
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know something?

326
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:30,717
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

327
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:32,958
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be the reason behind it all.

328
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's why she got kicked out.

329
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonder Woman had a full... Right, right.

330
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:39,641
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

331
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you want to know why I'm not reading chat?

332
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:42,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a comment right now.

333
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Who said Tommy Tallarico?

334
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I think somebody's very confused about who's on the show right now.

335
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:47,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

336
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:48,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm not reading chat.

337
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,867
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, you've actually got a good point there.

338
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:52,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what is this?

339
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Paris Hilton doesn't know the name of her own game?

340
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:55,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what is this?

341
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Diamond Quest Diamond Quest

342
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

343
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's expecting her to have a brain?

344
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:24,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, gee, I don't even know what my game is called despite the fact that it's written right behind her.

345
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:26,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's on the wall behind her.

346
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You're assuming she can read.

347
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:28,819
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also got her name in it.

348
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:33,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So she went from calling it Paris Hilton's Jewel Gym to just Diamond Quest.

349
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:40,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you know, that's what happens when you hire a dumb, blonde, millionaire, billionaire to promote your game.

350
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:46,923
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have someone poor and usually a gamer if you want them to actually give credibility to your game.

351
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:51,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go ahead and try to wrap up the two interesting things game.

352
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:55,320
[SPEAKER_05]: One more interesting thing I saw today, and boy, so much to see.

353
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,121
[SPEAKER_05]: What else would I say would be one more interesting thing?

354
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:03,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the use of Pac-Man arcade machines to put the cell phone game in.

355
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:09,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was a very interesting use of, it's almost vandalizing a classic piece of machinery.

356
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,931
[SPEAKER_05]: But I suppose it's Namco, they can do what they want with it.

357
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,853
[SPEAKER_05]: But as somebody who used to be a huge pinball fan, I will give Namco this.

358
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:19,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the Baby Pac-Man machine being there.

359
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know Baby Pac-Man was the Pac-Man game that was half Pac-Man, half pinball.

360
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:25,417
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be pictures going up on our side of this machine.

361
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:26,878
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura loves this too.

362
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:29,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never got a chance to go back over there and make an offer on it.

363
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:46,052
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been co-hunting for like a, she'll actually be able to afford it, but I've been secretly wanting a Baby Pac-Man machine for forever, so it was kind of weird to see one there, but you couldn't play it because they were advertising the Baby Pac-Man cell phone game on it.

364
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:49,194
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually wasn't even Baby Pac-Man, it was just Pac-Man Pinball, which wasn't all that great.

365
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I played quite a number of mobile phone games over at Namco Mobile.

366
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:58,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to chat room because now they're finally saying something interesting.

367
00:21:58,924 --> 00:22:00,405
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I'm only giving you a hard time, Chad.

368
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,106
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I love you guys.

369
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:04,167
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join in, tonight we're in chat.allgames.com.

370
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:09,330
[SPEAKER_05]: We are hijacking the all games chat room for our own evil purposes.

371
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:13,912
[SPEAKER_05]: CKY Mike says, Sky, anything about Resident Evil 5?

372
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think... It wasn't on the floor.

373
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:18,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

374
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:20,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't on the floor.

375
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:26,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was a trailer, but it was one of those... It was like the Final Fantasy XIII trailer.

376
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:30,862
[SPEAKER_05]: What did that tell you besides, hey, it's being made and it's coming to the system?

377
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,090
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

378
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,372
[SPEAKER_05]: There really wasn't a lot of news on Resident Evil 5.

379
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:39,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a ton of games last year, too, that they were showing at Square Enix's booth that we didn't even see this year.

380
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:40,577
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

381
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:41,377
[SPEAKER_03]: So they disappeared.

382
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:41,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?

383
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:42,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us examples.

384
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:43,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember what they're called now.

385
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,803
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like a trilogy of games, all of which I was not interested in.

386
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:52,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, also, Devil May Cry 4.

387
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see that at all.

388
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even shown, and...

389
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what was really pissing me off was the fact that Fatal Inertia wasn't on the floor other than, you know, just video.

390
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:05,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

391
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:06,335
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

392
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:38,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I don't know what my runner-up is right now.

393
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:38,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right.

394
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:39,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have one?

395
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:41,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

396
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,582
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this one I actually didn't play because it was only a video.

397
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:51,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to have to go with Dead or Alive Extreme 2.

398
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And why is this?

399
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:59,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, sadly enough, I will probably buy that game.

400
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:00,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he likes the boobies.

401
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:02,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the achievement points.

402
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:04,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Danny likes the movies.

403
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,391
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you're an achievement point whore.

404
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:12,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a fan of the Barbie dress-up mode, basically, where you get to choose bikinis for the girls and all that stuff?

405
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:19,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to laugh at that game just by looking at it, because it's so blatantly... It's like a Girls Gone Wild video.

406
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:28,846
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally is like they have that new series of Girls Gone Wild videos that you see late at night, you know, where they're making them do games, okay?

407
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's basically this.

408
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:31,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

409
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:35,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say my runner-up, I'll go next, my runner-up is Gears of War.

410
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:38,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Gears of War looked fantabulous.

411
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:45,450
[SPEAKER_05]: What I also like about it is that it looks like they've designed it so any dummy can do cool moves in it, which I think is great.

412
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I'm not a huge shooter fan, I will go to that realm once in a while for a great, great shooter game like Halo, and I think Gears of War is going to be one of those great shooter games if the demo is any indication.

413
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:00,002
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins

414
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:23,486
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

415
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:23,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

416
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

417
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

418
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, congratulations to Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

419
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:52,523
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura chooses you.

420
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:53,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott.

421
00:25:54,444 --> 00:26:05,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, I've been sitting here kind of like rolling to my head, you know, and most of my thoughts have been, well, I do have a lot of most surprising, like surprise me good and most disappointing.

422
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:06,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

423
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:07,795
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to save those for my show.

424
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to answer your question specifically.

425
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Best of show, there's no question in my mind.

426
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, you've got to do Runner Up.

427
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:14,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Runner Up.

428
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, jeez.

429
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:18,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, Runner Up.

430
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:20,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

431
00:26:21,344 --> 00:26:21,705
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

432
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:26,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say, for Runner Up, I'm going to say Saints Row.

433
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:33,293
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a game that, obviously, without a Grand Theft Auto title on the Xbox 360, I'm looking for that kind of open-ended...

434
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:37,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Carjacking, blow stuff up, different kinds of weapons.

435
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:45,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously what I like about Saints Row is that it goes another step further and allows me to create anybody I want to be the main character.

436
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:46,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really went for it.

437
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:50,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the spiky here, big fat guy, and I could run around the city like that.

438
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,551
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one where you could be the girl or the guy, right?

439
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you could be the girl.

440
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:57,912
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a gang type.

441
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,012
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a THQ game.

442
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at the Microsoft booth and then right across from Microsoft booth they had like three or four demo stations there.

443
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:05,534
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's carjacking.

444
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:07,994
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to Grand Theft Auto.

445
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:12,335
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by Volition, the guys that did Red Faction and what was the other?

446
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:14,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Free Space, Descent Free Space.

447
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,537
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's well done.

448
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:21,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always concerned because every time we've seen footage for this game, it's been choppy.

449
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,400
[SPEAKER_01]: The frame rate has been bad.

450
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,682
[SPEAKER_01]: The word has been that it's not going to be ready, it's not going to be good, and it's been delayed.

451
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:30,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But my time with it was fun.

452
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:34,926
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely needs a little more work, but I would say that is my runner-up for Best of Show.

453
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:35,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

454
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:36,567
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

455
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:42,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Best of Show, the best damn game at E3, period, using any criteria you want.

456
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:43,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

457
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:45,331
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

458
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,948
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Dead Rising, I love that game.

459
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:06,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's one of those games that I'm going to be playing for hours.

460
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:08,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've said that over and over.

461
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very open-ended.

462
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You basically do anything.

463
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:16,732
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's only about three hours long, but you can play it over and over and over and over again.

464
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:19,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a brief description of the game, because I don't think it's been brought up on the podcast yet.

465
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, Dead Rising basically is Dawn of the Dead, the game.

466
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:34,241
[SPEAKER_03]: You play a main character who is this photojournalist, and you're stuck in a mall with a bunch of zombies, but you can kill the zombies in any way possible, anything that's anywhere in the game.

467
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:38,143
[SPEAKER_03]: In stores, you can pick up any item and just use it as a weapon.

468
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:39,944
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like over 200 items.

469
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:42,185
[SPEAKER_03]: You can customize your character and the way he looks.

470
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:43,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You can rescue people.

471
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:45,307
[SPEAKER_03]: You take photos of stuff.

472
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:48,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really unique...

473
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

474
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,374
[SPEAKER_05]: The interactiveness, I love that stuff.

475
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the fact that what your friends do can screw up your world.

476
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:21,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the freedom to abduct aliens and then hurl them into space and watch them fall crashing down to Earth in a bloody pulp.

477
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like one of those games you're going to have the freedom to do whatever you want.

478
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:26,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be incredible.

479
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:31,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong, I love PC gaming, but I would love to see a game like this on 360 as well, if it's possible.

480
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:33,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, I don't know.

481
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it might be too massive.

482
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:37,607
[SPEAKER_05]: for the confines of a console though.

483
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:41,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So PC gamers, you really are getting a good one with this one, Spore.

484
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:42,670
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

485
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go with Zelda, honestly.

486
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:51,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... I love the Zelda series, like almost every one of them with the exception of Majora's Mask and Wind Waker.

487
00:29:53,896 --> 00:30:04,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So this looked like it was really following directly in the footsteps of Ocarina of Time, which was probably one of my favorites in the series.

488
00:30:05,022 --> 00:30:05,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

489
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:12,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Just having the Wii, the Wii-con, or Wiimote.

490
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:13,709
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wiimote as I call it, yes.

491
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:15,210
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wiicon as I call it.

492
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, feeling the shake of the chain as you throw the claw hook, hearing it impact, you know, hearing the twang of your bow as it flies back, that is if you put the thing right by your ear.

493
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:45,017
[SPEAKER_02]: The control was a little bit interesting to get used to, but other than that, it was... And it really didn't look like it was touched up much more than the GameCube, but honestly, everyone who listens to our show knows about how much I give a damn about the graphics, which is, like, hardly any.

494
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:46,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

495
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:47,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.

496
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:54,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably the most fun of anything I played, you know, next to Ghost of Goblin, so that gets it.

497
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:54,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

498
00:30:56,326 --> 00:31:01,735
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting choice because Zelda was such a huge game at last year's E3.

499
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:03,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Was enough changed?

500
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:05,895
[SPEAKER_02]: There was quite a bit changed.

501
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:12,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to see the demo, but I had talked to plenty who did.

502
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,599
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean last year?

503
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:13,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, last year.

504
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:16,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I had gone back and seen things later of it.

505
00:31:16,402 --> 00:31:19,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they've really cleaned it up.

506
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:33,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually just checking out that issue of EGM sitting over on the couch, and they had a few side-by-side comparisons for the Twilight World, where they had it sort of a monochrome color before, and now they've gone through and touched it up and added in,

507
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:35,335
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

508
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:35,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was good.

509
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,671
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, chat room wants to know, Derek H is asking, is Scott asleep?

510
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:05,692
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not at all.

511
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,793
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to be an exhausted guy, though.

512
00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:08,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little tired.

513
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:12,216
[SPEAKER_05]: With all this going on here at the E3 Outpost, which is awesome.

514
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:13,697
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great idea, by the way.

515
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:14,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having us.

516
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:17,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And E3 and all that other stuff.

517
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a long week.

518
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,181
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little tiring, as you guys know.

519
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:24,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you did the same show I did, and you've been here just as much as I have.

520
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:25,284
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're tired, too.

521
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:27,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all good because E3 is over.

522
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,446
[SPEAKER_01]: But we get to leave tomorrow.

523
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:29,607
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get to leave tomorrow.

524
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:31,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott, your best of show.

525
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:37,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are going to be surprised that I love Viva Pinata as much as I do.

526
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:38,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

527
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:38,674
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

528
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:40,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you bastard.

529
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:41,516
[SPEAKER_05]: You bastard.

530
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:45,859
[SPEAKER_05]: You had me going for a minute.

531
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Viva Pinata.

532
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Silent Wind there who made the trek from Bakersfield.

533
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried my damnedest to get him into E3 and I could not do it.

534
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:55,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very sorry about that, Silent Wind.

535
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:57,408
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's no question in my mind.

536
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:58,629
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already said it.

537
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Sport is the absolute best game at E3 this year.

538
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Will Wright is a freaking genius.

539
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:11,360
[SPEAKER_01]: We went into that little room and, you know, I thought I knew pretty much everything there was to know about the game and then I realized...

540
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:26,291
[SPEAKER_01]: All the creatures you find in the game have essentially been combined with a trading card element so that you can print out these trading cards and play like a Magic the Gathering type game with it off the computer completely.

541
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:27,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I had heard.

542
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:30,794
[SPEAKER_05]: The stuff they want to do with it is phenomenal, those things you were talking about.

543
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:47,744
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had inside the room creatures that were like action figures, statuettes, and he made them with a 3D printer right from the game, which I believe will be possible to print out your creatures that you create and make them into like figurines that you can have in your room.

544
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:55,390
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Orange Lounge, when Loki and I went there, we aren't cool enough to have Will Wright demo it himself for us, so we got some other girl, but she was good.

545
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,651
[SPEAKER_05]: You went into the little room?

546
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:57,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

547
00:33:58,192 --> 00:33:58,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so did we.

548
00:33:59,012 --> 00:33:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised.

549
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I was expecting you to be one of Will's minions.

550
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:02,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

551
00:34:02,495 --> 00:34:03,196
[SPEAKER_01]: A little sim minion.

552
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:03,916
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we got a minion.

553
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:06,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he was great.

554
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:13,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he only showed the kind of third level and space level.

555
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:15,324
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't get to see the kind of amoebic level.

556
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:26,352
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I think is so phenomenal about this, and you talked about it, sharing the content, you know, anyone who knows SimCity and the Sims knows that there is, like he says, 10% of the people who buy those games that make

557
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:27,212
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

558
00:34:49,816 --> 00:35:10,350
[SPEAKER_01]: You encounter this creature, you attack this creature, you can see who made it, find more of the creatures they've made, and then the ability to go from Amoeba to galactic, outside, millions of planets, and when you think about how many units of Sims sold, and how many units of Spore will sell, the promise, you know, a lot of game developers, well,

559
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Our community will be so big, we'll have so much content, and usually there's nothing good.

560
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:27,497
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that a Will Wright game will get the audience, it'll get the customers, and it'll get the creativity, and I think we're going to be playing just an incalculable amount of creative characters and creatures in this game.

561
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:30,738
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I was sitting there watching the demo, I was always saying, this is too good to be true.

562
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:31,718
[SPEAKER_05]: This is too ambitious.

563
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I remember, oh yeah, there's like 20 Sims expansions packs.

564
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:37,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, anything's possible.

565
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I do believe that you're right.

566
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:46,742
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of so big that maybe people won't be able to kind of get through it and won't be able to get to all elements of it.

567
00:35:47,602 --> 00:36:11,858
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's kind of what I like about this game is that it is very open and sandboxy so you can just play around and create stuff you can play around at any of the levels but if you're a hardcore gamer and you're looking for the more than the eight hour black game experience you know Spore will deliver probably way it'll be on the World of Warcraft scale of gameplay I have no doubt it'll do well

568
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:15,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it doesn't do well, there's something wrong with the gaming community.

569
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,883
[SPEAKER_01]: The only hint that it might not do well is you can look at Sims Online and say, well, that was an alright game and it didn't do well.

570
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:25,925
[SPEAKER_01]: But Sims Online was a dumb idea.

571
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Sims Online just turned into Vegas.

572
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:28,847
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a bunch of hookers and drugs.

573
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:32,689
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a couple key things that were wrong with it, unfortunately.

574
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:34,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's keep it moving.

575
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst game of the show.

576
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst game of the show.

577
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:39,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody want to start off?

578
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:39,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

579
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:45,879
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I almost want to say Africa.

580
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:57,051
[SPEAKER_03]: But, since I didn't get to play it, I didn't really get to play this game either, but I think it's a stupid idea for a game.

581
00:36:57,872 --> 00:36:59,614
[SPEAKER_03]: The Eye of Judgment.

582
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst game ever.

583
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:13,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why is because it's not really a game, and the fact that it reminds me of something that you would create to kind of enhance a Magic the Gathering tournament.

584
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:18,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Like something to throw on the TV if you were going to broadcast a Magic the Gathering tournament type thing.

585
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:21,336
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about as useful as it is.

586
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:31,523
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you have to remember to remove cards from the playing field so that the PlayStation doesn't accidentally spawn the creature again is stupid.

587
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:37,784
[SPEAKER_05]: My worst game of the show would be found over at 2K Games, this booth.

588
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:43,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the new Family Feud game coming to, what, I think PlayStation 2.

589
00:37:44,085 --> 00:37:52,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And while granted there might be a market for the Family Feud game, I had the Family Feud game on the Commodore 64 and not a goddamn thing has changed.

590
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would we need this?

591
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:56,208
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so, I don't know.

592
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:57,649
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey says you're right.

593
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:00,592
[SPEAKER_01]: 74% said you are correct.

594
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:01,593
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst game of the show.

595
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Survey says this game sucks.

596
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:07,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And the hosts have changed so many times.

597
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:15,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're going to bring me a Family Feud game, at least give me Richard Dawson trying to make out with the chicks that were all on that show.

598
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:16,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the host?

599
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:17,966
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that committed suicide?

600
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:20,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Some random guy.

601
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:23,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I know on the real TV show, I think it's the guy from Home Improvement.

602
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they couldn't get his likeness for the game.

603
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:27,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Too expensive, I bet.

604
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,210
[SPEAKER_01]: His license is huge.

605
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,651
[SPEAKER_05]: What a piece of poop.

606
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:37,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And to think, that game was next to Dora the Explorer, and I still named Family Feud.

607
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:41,195
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, DarkSakura, worst freaking game at E3.

608
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:42,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic the Hedgehog.

609
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:44,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

610
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:46,337
[SPEAKER_02]: The PS3 one.

611
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:47,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

612
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Sonic rolling over.

613
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:53,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And she is such a Sega fangirl that there must be some atrocities.

614
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:54,980
[SPEAKER_02]: The control.

615
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:56,863
[SPEAKER_02]: The game was pretty.

616
00:38:57,523 --> 00:38:59,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it was really, really pretty.

617
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:01,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for some of the jaggies on the PS3.

618
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, even the Xbox 360 one, because I did go back and check that out.

619
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,937
[SPEAKER_02]: The control was utter crap.

620
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:09,899
[SPEAKER_02]: You turn it just, you know...

621
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,561
[SPEAKER_02]: The best controlling version of Sonic Adventure was on the Dreamcast.

622
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:14,621
[SPEAKER_02]: It was smooth.

623
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Why couldn't they have taken a page from the Dreamcast?

624
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:18,943
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it right.

625
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:23,584
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it to where if you just go a little bit to the left, drop the cliff.

626
00:39:24,424 --> 00:39:31,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on top of that, the angle that they have him fall at, you can see that the platform that you've been standing on is just floating in the air.

627
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:33,567
[SPEAKER_02]: He just falls into nothingness.

628
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:39,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, if they're at least going to do that, have it from an overhead angle and have him fade out, you know?

629
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:44,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I could see there were a few collision detection issues.

630
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:48,334
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, is that they can do a good Sonic game.

631
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:50,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I played Sonic Rivals, that was fun.

632
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I have to call it the worst game if they take something that I adore so much and make utter crap out of it.

633
00:39:58,659 --> 00:39:59,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

634
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it gets worst game on Control alone.

635
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:03,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to hear it.

636
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:04,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Scott.

637
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:06,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So am I. Worst freaking game at E3.

638
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:11,204
[SPEAKER_01]: This time I'm not kidding when I say people will be surprised when they hear me say this.

639
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:15,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Madden for the PlayStation 3 was the worst game that I played at E3.

640
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:24,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you, if you're a PlayStation guy, girl, and you're expecting to pick up a PS3 at launch, and you like Madden,

641
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:29,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Get ready to go through what we went through last year with the Xbox 360 version.

642
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:35,234
[SPEAKER_01]: From the words of an EA Sports employee, the game will not work right.

643
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:37,275
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just saying they haven't had enough time.

644
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:38,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be just like the 360.

645
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:41,558
[SPEAKER_01]: They still don't have final dev kits.

646
00:40:42,858 --> 00:41:00,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Madden has been completely rebuilt and when you rebuild and you try to let people in the house you're rebuilding before it's done it's gonna feel like it's not done and Madden on the 360 wasn't done he acknowledged that he said you know you're right it was broken and he said that's gonna be the same way this year

647
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:08,476
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would have thought all the work they did since the release of the 360 version would have carried over to the PS3, but unfortunately no.

648
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:22,569
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing about Madden really is they've got 3D grass for the first time, so if you're excited about 3D grass, you'll be happy with the new Madden, but otherwise, PS3 Madden, it was the worst thing I played, it was a joke.

649
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:23,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's...

650
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:24,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

651
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:29,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we don't talk a lot about sports games on this show, but even the non- You're allergic, right?

652
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:31,277
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, I like Blades of Steel.

653
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:32,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

654
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:33,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Tecmo Bowl.

655
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:34,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I like NBA Jam.

656
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are good games.

657
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:37,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, though.

658
00:41:37,302 --> 00:41:41,886
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm curious about, even the non-sports games fans are interested in Madden on the Wii.

659
00:41:42,527 --> 00:41:47,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious, what are your thoughts, sports game fan of Madden on the Wii?

660
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:56,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, all the sports games on the Wii are going to benefit from the fact that we've been pushing buttons for sports games for years.

661
00:41:56,818 --> 00:42:00,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found the novelty of using the controllers really enjoyable.

662
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:03,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it to be a new challenge in the game.

663
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:11,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just adding a vision cone to a game, I found throwing the ball, like using the motion of throwing a ball,

664
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,369
[SPEAKER_01]: was really kind of cool and it really appealed to me.

665
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:24,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they've just kind of begun to tip the iceberg of what's possible in terms of unique gameplay elements with this special controller.

666
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:30,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say I was surprised that it didn't feel cheesy gimmicky even at this early stage.

667
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:55,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I think graphically it'll be able to be decent enough that it won't be a disappointment to people who are kind of used to the graphics they have but I have to tell you I think that if you can lock in the Wii controller into the kind of sports games we're used to whether it be hockey from the guys at 2K Sports or baseball from the guys at 2K or EA even

668
00:42:56,464 --> 00:42:59,247
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I'd really like to see is a boxing game used the Wii.

669
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:12,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people who are sports fans are going to be ready to make this jump because let's face it for years we've been playing sports games the exact same way and just watching the guy play baseball with the Wii controller

670
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:14,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me excited.

671
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Graphically, I think the Nintendo sports games, they need to evolve a little.

672
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:24,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little tired of these cutesy little Japanese characters for my baseball games and my tennis games.

673
00:43:24,223 --> 00:43:27,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see some realistic players here in 2006.

674
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:30,986
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Miyamoto in tennis was hilarious, you have to admit.

675
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:31,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the faces.

676
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:33,847
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best part of the press conference.

677
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:34,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggie Fils-Aimé.

678
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:41,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto on the faces of those characters.

679
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly the show stealer at the Nintendo press conference.

680
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:47,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty adorable.

681
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:48,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around.

682
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:53,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Best booth, worst... Well, let's start with best booth using any criteria you want.

683
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:55,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Best booth using any criteria you want.

684
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:59,796
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be design, it can be what was in it, it can be the way the staff treated you.

685
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Any criteria you want.

686
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:01,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

687
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:07,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to say Sega's booth was probably the best booth that I played at, at least.

688
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:15,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked Full Auto 2, and I loved being able to play multiplayer in Chromehounds.

689
00:44:17,202 --> 00:44:22,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they had a really good setup, the videos were everywhere, so I liked it.

690
00:44:22,903 --> 00:44:24,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were giving away lots of stuff.

691
00:44:26,004 --> 00:44:26,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

692
00:44:26,724 --> 00:44:28,285
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, best booth at E3?

693
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:28,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

694
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,271
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP Area PSP Area

695
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:55,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the couches.

696
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:58,895
[SPEAKER_02]: You could sit down and your feet were like, I'm sitting down.

697
00:44:59,136 --> 00:45:01,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, the way you played those PSP demos was very interesting.

698
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:09,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's how I sit on my couch and play, sort of half sideways, but I thought that it was a neat, it was easy to get to everything.

699
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:11,048
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't crowded like, you know,

700
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:15,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I'm about to say this because three years ago

701
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:36,233
[SPEAKER_05]: This would never... Best and this company would have never come out of my mouth.

702
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:43,400
[SPEAKER_05]: But times have changed so much, and this year's E3 proved that Microsoft has got the best booth to show.

703
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:45,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with that.

704
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:51,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft is in such an interesting position right now, because they do have a year ahead.

705
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:54,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And every problem I had with the Xbox...

706
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:56,886
[SPEAKER_05]: They got it this time.

707
00:45:57,526 --> 00:46:00,067
[SPEAKER_05]: There is something for the role-playing fans.

708
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:01,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Enchanted Arms looks great.

709
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:04,189
[SPEAKER_05]: There is something for the cutesy people.

710
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:07,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Viva Pinata... Well, okay, maybe there'll be something else next year.

711
00:46:09,112 --> 00:46:14,494
[SPEAKER_05]: There is something for sports people, action people.

712
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:17,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way the booth was laid out was smart.

713
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:22,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Their demonstration was inside a little room, the Gears of War thing, where the floor vibrated.

714
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,257
[SPEAKER_05]: You got your ticket.

715
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:25,278
[SPEAKER_05]: You came back.

716
00:46:25,338 --> 00:46:27,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you put headphones on.

717
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:28,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just so excited.

718
00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:30,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting everywhere.

719
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:39,101
[SPEAKER_05]: But Microsoft, the people would come up and talk to you, did not judge you based on your credentials, were happy and excited to tell you about the game.

720
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:43,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so surprised at how far Microsoft has come.

721
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:45,482
[SPEAKER_05]: By far and above the best booth in E3 2017.

722
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:50,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually do have to agree with you there because I was impressed with the area they had laid out for DDR.

723
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:55,785
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave you enough space to play that you're not face up in front of the TV.

724
00:46:55,945 --> 00:46:56,545
[SPEAKER_05]: They sure did.

725
00:46:56,665 --> 00:47:06,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, at the end of the show they had these people walking around taking photos and attaching it like little Polaroids and attaching it in a frame.

726
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:08,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to one of the girls over there.

727
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:10,069
[SPEAKER_02]: She was just as friendly as she could be.

728
00:47:10,649 --> 00:47:18,715
[SPEAKER_02]: She's saying, oh yeah, Method Man just came by here and talking about how some of the less savory people there, we both agreed that we just like Paris Hilton.

729
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:34,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the chat room is getting a little angsty at me naming Microsoft because, you know, I think there's a lot of people still in that area where they don't want to go over the Microsoft products yet because Microsoft hasn't done enough outside the realm of sports and driving and stuff that's won them over yet.

730
00:47:34,706 --> 00:47:36,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you guys, they're on the right path.

731
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:36,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

732
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:49,017
[SPEAKER_05]: and don't get me wrong, there's even nice things about the PlayStation 3 and of course about the Wii, but Microsoft is really in a good position right now and just the booth itself was great.

733
00:47:49,657 --> 00:47:56,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not packed like it was a couple years ago because they were more intelligent about where they put everything.

734
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:58,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was easier to access things.

735
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:02,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just on all those levels, I'm considering and it's great.

736
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott, oh, Scott took his headphones off.

737
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, are you on your way out or?

738
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:12,716
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I just got an emergency phone call just to tell me that they love the show.

739
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

740
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:15,379
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just calling in.

741
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,160
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, I love the show that you guys are doing.

742
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.

743
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:18,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

744
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:21,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever that was, hello and thank you.

745
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:21,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

746
00:48:21,664 --> 00:48:22,285
[SPEAKER_05]: They're enjoying it.

747
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:22,705
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

748
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:24,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Best freaking booth at E3.

749
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:34,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, Microsoft's booth was very good, but it is, to me, hard to deny what EA is able to put together each year.

750
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:40,403
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's more about that Thunderdome and the way they put together that video.

751
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:48,972
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is kind of a lot of responsibility to be the first thing people see when they walk into the Big South Hall, and I think that EA...

752
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:49,732
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

753
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:12,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, clear game stations.

754
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:24,259
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Superman today, I was expecting not to be able to get any kind of demo, but I stood there, watched him give a great demo to one person, then he left, and I got to, you know, really get up close and ask a lot of questions.

755
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that they've designed it really well.

756
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:29,203
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clean, the way it's laid out.

757
00:49:29,643 --> 00:49:34,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I went into the little private area room with the NFL Network, and even back there, it's just very nice.

758
00:49:36,888 --> 00:49:41,532
[SPEAKER_01]: The people were friendly, and I just found that to be, you know, a good job.

759
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:43,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And for God's sakes, it better be.

760
00:49:43,253 --> 00:49:44,374
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got all the money in the world.

761
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,575
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a lot of big AAA titles.

762
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:49,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got the best spot in the entire show.

763
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:50,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Better than even the big three.

764
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:58,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to say, I thought the EA booth... Now, I did want to jump quickly back to your earlier question about most surprising.

765
00:49:58,284 --> 00:49:58,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

766
00:49:58,744 --> 00:50:02,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remembered something that's right up the OLR alley.

767
00:50:02,987 --> 00:50:03,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

768
00:50:03,107 --> 00:50:03,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

769
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:19,441
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kensha Hall, I was checking out the no-vent controller, but across from them was a booth showing off the world's first massively multiplayer DDR game.

770
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:21,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was interesting.

771
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:22,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It surprised me.

772
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:26,423
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too bad I couldn't understand it because it was all in a different language.

773
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:28,343
[SPEAKER_05]: But I looked at it and I went, hmm, that's interesting.

774
00:50:30,044 --> 00:50:30,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shocked.

775
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:35,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, there are people dancing together online all over the world.

776
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:40,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was kind of shocking, surprising, and weird.

777
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:40,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst Booth

778
00:50:54,969 --> 00:51:06,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really hard for me to say because honestly the worst booth as far as its showing went was I was really underwhelmed also by the PS3 area.

779
00:51:08,654 --> 00:51:10,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony overall gets best and worst.

780
00:51:10,855 --> 00:51:14,957
[SPEAKER_02]: They get best for layout, worst for games because

781
00:51:15,817 --> 00:51:28,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, true, they were, they did have, you know, Tekken and Ghosts and Goblins, but when you went up to the PS3 area, it was all, I was surrounded by so much crap that it literally stank, and I had to get out of there.

782
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:29,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

783
00:51:29,497 --> 00:51:30,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we're smooth.

784
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:30,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

785
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:31,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

786
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:39,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's booth, you had to wait in a four-hour line to get into another booth to where you'd wait another hour to play a game.

787
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:45,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a line to wait in another line to wait to play some games, which were just tech demos.

788
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:50,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the jackasses that were, you know, working on the demos there, freaking...

789
00:51:50,427 --> 00:51:53,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, five minutes made quick, you know, that type of stuff.

790
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:54,610
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just very hurried.

791
00:51:54,890 --> 00:52:02,154
[SPEAKER_03]: They let people in, they were, just people weren't leaving, so there's hundreds of people, you know, moshed in there, like a club or something.

792
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:05,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't very conducive to being able to play the games.

793
00:52:05,516 --> 00:52:08,358
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS stations, as Bobby mentioned earlier,

794
00:52:08,738 --> 00:52:09,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

795
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,041
[SPEAKER_03]: What else could be wrong?

796
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:28,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, Game Boy Advance, but no, I don't really miss that.

797
00:52:29,043 --> 00:52:33,406
[SPEAKER_02]: When Booth had Game Boy Advance games, that was SNK, which was like one game.

798
00:52:33,426 --> 00:52:36,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But not even Nintendo was showing it, so it's too bad.

799
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:42,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually am really surprised that you said they were being rude, because the people I dealt with at Nintendo were nothing but brilliantly nice.

800
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I had really nice people, too.

801
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:54,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That girl got me Koji Kono's autograph, and then the guy who was there at Zelda, he was all like, you know, helping me out with some of the controls until I got used to it, and

802
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:55,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

803
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:11,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

804
00:53:12,938 --> 00:53:15,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also say Nintendo was the worst booth at E3.

805
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't get me wrong, I love the Wii.

806
00:53:18,802 --> 00:53:20,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm going to buy the Wii.

807
00:53:20,183 --> 00:53:20,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's awesome.

808
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:27,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But the design of the booth was shit because last... I mean, when they did the DS, it was so much better.

809
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:34,554
[SPEAKER_05]: You go in, they show the preview, they have a set amount of time that you get to spend with the demos.

810
00:53:34,854 --> 00:53:39,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, there's incentive to go back through because you may get to go to the demo room that has even more demos.

811
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:40,278
[SPEAKER_05]: There's much...

812
00:53:40,698 --> 00:53:41,659
[SPEAKER_05]: SmarterMade that year.

813
00:53:41,979 --> 00:53:47,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pissed that they didn't show anything on GameCube because that Paper Mario, Super Paper Mario, whatever it was, looks awesome.

814
00:53:47,742 --> 00:53:49,564
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a crime that that wasn't on the floor.

815
00:53:50,724 --> 00:53:54,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sad that they're ignoring the advance when they were pushing the micro so hard last year.

816
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:59,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo made some... Whoever designed Nintendo's booth should be fired for E307.

817
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring back the old booth.

818
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:01,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it was better.

819
00:54:02,392 --> 00:54:05,654
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sad I'm making that judgment not even based on the content.

820
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:09,536
[SPEAKER_05]: and the fact that I dealt with some very nice people in Nintendo, it's too bad.

821
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:12,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But the booth design cannot be ignored.

822
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:14,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a horrible way to show the Wii.

823
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott, worst booth?

824
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:18,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, worst booth.

825
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:20,644
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many to choose from.

826
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:30,852
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult because I found a lot of these booths to be poorly designed, poorly laid out, poor choice of costume people.

827
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:33,273
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

828
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:33,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

829
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:41,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to say I'm going to agree with you guys that Nintendo was poorly designed.

830
00:54:41,222 --> 00:54:44,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were in a tough position because they knew everyone that goes to E3.

831
00:54:44,963 --> 00:54:52,305
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way you leave E3 07 without having to at least try the Wii because there's only what?

832
00:54:52,386 --> 00:54:55,627
[SPEAKER_01]: PC, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

833
00:54:55,927 --> 00:54:59,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were to go back and people would say, wow, we heard about this crazy controller.

834
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:00,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you play it?

835
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:02,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said, no, you're kind of a loser.

836
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:09,794
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fact that they made it so difficult and the fact that they didn't show a lot of the stuff that people wanted to see.

837
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:14,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you gotta say boo to Nintendo.

838
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:14,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo.

839
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:16,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, sorry.

840
00:55:16,918 --> 00:55:19,020
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I still consider myself a Nintendo fanboy.

841
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, really, I'm a gaming fanboy.

842
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:20,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I like them all.

843
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:25,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But Nintendo, that boot design, fire the architect.

844
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:26,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire him.

845
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:27,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby wanted to interject something real quick.

846
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:30,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody here say LucasArts?

847
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,043
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my runner up.

848
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:35,964
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my runner up.

849
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:37,325
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you hiding, LucasArts?

850
00:55:37,345 --> 00:55:41,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Who kept their booth closed for two days, then opened it up with a line?

851
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:43,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Two and a half days.

852
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:44,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Two and a half days.

853
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: They opened it up at noon today, then it was a line.

854
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:50,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares about LucasArts after that point?

855
00:55:50,873 --> 00:55:56,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like it was a museum in there, which means it was nothing more than a George Lucas ego inflation thing.

856
00:55:56,957 --> 00:55:59,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they had a video of people that worked there going...

857
00:56:00,686 --> 00:56:03,328
[SPEAKER_01]: The next generation... What was the line?

858
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:06,070
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something about... I don't know because I haven't saw it.

859
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:08,092
[SPEAKER_01]: We will make the next generation game.

860
00:56:08,112 --> 00:56:10,334
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the video wall when you're walking towards West Hall?

861
00:56:10,674 --> 00:56:13,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, why don't you make it outside where we can see it?

862
00:56:13,176 --> 00:56:15,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean they haven't done crap yet?

863
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they always do that.

864
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,063
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an elitist mentality and, you know, that's LucasArts for you.

865
00:56:21,243 --> 00:56:23,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a category I'd like to ask everyone about.

866
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we've got to make it real quick.

867
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:25,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quick.

868
00:56:25,366 --> 00:56:27,868
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the most bizarre thing you saw?

869
00:56:28,729 --> 00:56:32,051
[SPEAKER_05]: The line of people to see Paris Hilton, get out of my E3.

870
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:32,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.

871
00:56:33,031 --> 00:56:33,912
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you people doing there?

872
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,752
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not a celebrity gawk fest.

873
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:37,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

874
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:51,660
[SPEAKER_03]: The strangest thing I saw, I would have to say, because there wasn't too much weird stuff, but at the very end as we were walking out, there was some impromptu dance party going on in the N-Gage booth, and I don't know what that was about.

875
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,681
[SPEAKER_05]: That was horrible.

876
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:57,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite the fact I bash on the N-Gage an awful lot, their booth was actually pretty...

877
00:56:57,703 --> 00:56:58,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't go in.

878
00:56:58,343 --> 00:56:59,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like I was Superman.

879
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:00,605
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Kryptonite.

880
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:05,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would try to walk towards the N-Gage booth and I physically was pushed backwards.

881
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:09,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it to cut through to get around the massive Konami people watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer.

882
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:10,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

883
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,050
[SPEAKER_05]: The booth design was slick.

884
00:57:12,591 --> 00:57:13,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Still hate the thing.

885
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I still hate the N-Gage, but the design is slick.

886
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:17,393
[SPEAKER_05]: They tried to sell it really well.

887
00:57:17,493 --> 00:57:18,974
[SPEAKER_05]: You're reminding me too much of the Apple Store.

888
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:20,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you.

889
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:23,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my most bizarre thing was WTF.

890
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:26,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Work Time Fun

891
00:57:41,314 --> 00:57:44,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, my weird thing was two things.

892
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:48,464
[SPEAKER_01]: One, those stupid inflatable rafts people were wearing on their back.

893
00:57:48,484 --> 00:57:58,297
[SPEAKER_01]: To see people in suits walking around with webs and inflatable rafts on their back, I just wanted to push them so that they'd fall and bounce and bounce back up.

894
00:57:59,218 --> 00:58:00,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to do that all day.

895
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:02,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst giveaway I've ever seen.

896
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:09,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is these hordes of people that stand in line for ridiculous things.

897
00:58:09,302 --> 00:58:11,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, okay, I like Adam West.

898
00:58:11,543 --> 00:58:14,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't understand wasting, you know, the show's three days.

899
00:58:15,545 --> 00:58:17,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Two and three quarters because the last day is short.

900
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:36,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are people spending their time waiting in lines, A, to see old celebrities or even like a Paris Hilton, like you said, and B, to get a small little trinket of something that you will probably lose very quickly or never use in your life.

901
00:58:36,615 --> 00:58:38,356
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's something cool, I'm all about it.

902
00:58:38,696 --> 00:58:40,817
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see people waiting as though...

903
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:44,520
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to receive communion from the Pope or something.

904
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,842
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very, very bizarre.

905
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:52,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Along the same lines, why do they go stand behind G4's booth to try and get on TV?

906
00:58:53,806 --> 00:58:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 G4 Booth

907
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:15,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

908
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we've got to wrap it up.

909
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys.

910
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:20,121
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a great show.

911
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:23,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott Rubin, thank you so much for joining us on tonight's program.

912
00:59:23,703 --> 00:59:27,324
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are welcome back here anytime, any day.

913
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:28,985
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure to have.

914
00:59:29,045 --> 00:59:29,986
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a lot of fun.

915
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:34,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said to you earlier before the show, anybody who's got a passion for gaming,

916
00:59:35,248 --> 00:59:36,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys have been doing this show so long.

917
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,789
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real testament to your passion for gaming.

918
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And your audience is a lucky group of people.

919
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:46,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad the All Games crew has had a chance to experience OLR live from E3.

920
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

921
00:59:47,153 --> 00:59:48,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what, Scott?

922
00:59:48,273 --> 00:59:48,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

923
00:59:48,973 --> 00:59:58,697
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I would have never thought, having, you know, four years ago, that we would be sitting here with somebody who has been to the ends of gaming media, you know, on the TV and stuff.

924
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:00,078
[SPEAKER_05]: This is surreal.

925
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:01,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for having us.

926
01:00:01,118 --> 01:00:01,718
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awesome.

927
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:02,759
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

928
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:05,960
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Bobby, thank you so much for being here as well.

929
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

930
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Your three days of hard work on the program.

931
01:00:08,821 --> 01:00:13,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, no, actually, and what I wanted to say is, you know, that I really appreciate being here.

932
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:15,084
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of your people listening probably don't know.

933
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:18,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I was listening to Orange Lounge Radio before they started podcasting.

934
01:00:18,645 --> 01:00:22,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I had listened to some of their live shows before the whole podcasting fact.

935
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:26,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was listening to their podcast since before I was doing a show.

936
01:00:26,688 --> 01:00:28,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me as a fan...

937
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:31,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a thrill to be able to be up here with the guys.

938
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:35,737
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of listeners probably would kill to be able to sit at least for one show.

939
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:36,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two!

940
01:00:36,878 --> 01:00:38,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two shows with the OLR guys.

941
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:43,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, and thank you to the OLR chatters for welcoming me and the family.

942
01:00:43,646 --> 01:00:47,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of really weird today when people were asking me, please be on the show again today.

943
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Move to Sacramento, we'll talk about it.

944
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:50,394
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

945
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:51,154
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

946
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:52,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

947
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I really would like to thank our OL Army for showing up in force.

948
01:00:56,178 --> 01:00:56,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

949
01:00:56,859 --> 01:00:57,699
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are awesome.

950
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:58,260
[SPEAKER_02]: In chat.

951
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very impressed to see so many people.

952
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was cool to meet some of you at E3 also.

953
01:01:03,304 --> 01:01:03,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

954
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:04,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Met up with a few people.

955
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:05,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And Justin.

956
01:01:05,766 --> 01:01:06,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

957
01:01:06,807 --> 01:01:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh, Justin.

958
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:08,008
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our guy.

959
01:01:08,028 --> 01:01:09,709
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even know how bad I owe you.

960
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit in chat says, support all games.

961
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill G4, damn posers.

962
01:01:17,055 --> 01:01:17,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment.

963
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:20,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

964
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,324
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want the real gaming media, you're going to have to go to the Internet.

965
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:25,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that.

966
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:26,086
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

967
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:27,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's wrap it up.

968
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:28,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Final, final thoughts.

969
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:29,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thoughts of E3.

970
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:32,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott, you want to indulge us with a final thought?

971
01:01:32,573 --> 01:01:33,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Final thoughts of E3.

972
01:01:33,494 --> 01:01:36,297
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every year we get very excited looking up to it.

973
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:37,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this year...

974
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:49,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is a transition year, I think I'm so shocked at how disappointing Sony's showing was that I almost don't feel the same as I ever have leaving an E3 before.

975
01:01:49,962 --> 01:01:54,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously those movies last year left us on such a high point, we couldn't believe, is it real, is it real?

976
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:59,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year the reality feels like a really wet towel smacking me in the face.

977
01:02:00,444 --> 01:02:06,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But being a guy that went out and got a 360, it just kind of shows that sometimes when you

978
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:10,529
[SPEAKER_01]: are there on day one to adopt the new technology.

979
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:14,872
[SPEAKER_01]: It pays off in the end, and so I'm glad I have a next-gen system.

980
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:19,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel like I got burnt, and hopefully Sony will surprise us when they release this machine in November.

981
01:02:20,256 --> 01:02:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Bobby, final thought.

982
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:24,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to go home.

983
01:02:25,518 --> 01:02:26,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, final thought.

984
01:02:27,399 --> 01:02:28,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, this is weird.

985
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:35,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really want to leave here because I swear, having come here like every day this week, it feels like a second home almost.

986
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:36,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I don't know.

987
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:39,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I need more plasma screens in my house, I think.

988
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Your new wife missed you.

989
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:43,848
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real show of emotion from Loki.

990
01:02:43,908 --> 01:02:45,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen this kind of emotion from him all week.

991
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, this is crazy.

992
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry I've been kind of buried in a laptop all week.

993
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:51,352
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have.

994
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:51,913
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that been?

995
01:02:51,993 --> 01:02:52,393
[SPEAKER_01]: A success?

996
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as good as one person can do.

997
01:02:58,915 --> 01:03:00,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe next year we'll have a bigger crew.

998
01:03:01,535 --> 01:03:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought, and then I'll let DarkSakura go.

999
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:08,256
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought would be, I was dissing on the chat room earlier, but secretly I love you guys.

1000
01:03:08,376 --> 01:03:11,877
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are the reason why we do this show.

1001
01:03:11,977 --> 01:03:14,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not just chatters, but listeners in general.

1002
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just the feedback and the positive support we've gotten is just amazing.

1003
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:21,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much, and that's that.

1004
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:21,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you at E307.

1005
01:03:21,859 --> 01:03:22,239
