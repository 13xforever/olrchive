14581	16244	Tonight, October 22nd, 2006.
16785	26000	New firmware is on deck to the PSP, a Nintendo DS game releases with a major bug still in the game, and is EA watching your every move?
32642	36304	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36364	43249	We are that video game podcast dedicated to gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, and what you, the gamer, really want to know.
43569	44950	Welcome to our show.
45771	47112	We're pre-taping this week.
47152	48112	We're a little early.
48532	52135	It is Wednesday night, October 18th, but this will be our week show.
52175	58079	That's because I'm traveling this week and so is one of our lovely co-hosts here, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
58319	59940	Are you saying that Loki is lovely?
60751	62372	I suppose, in his own manly way.
62592	63633	And I'm moving.
64753	65194	Yeah, that's right.
65214	67395	You're moving this weekend, so everybody's busy this weekend.
67435	69216	So it's just a bad weekend for us.
69256	72038	I'm going to see Boy Love.
72978	73659	Oh, YaoiCon?
74019	74979	Going to YaoiCon.
75159	76520	And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.
76560	76640	And?
78171	80212	Don't blame us collectively, but you can blame Rob personally.
80232	80592	Sure, why not?
107216	108036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
134102	136002	I hate the music in it and I hate the sound effects.
136643	139283	And just watching him do the same crap over and over.
139703	145844	If I want to play a good beat-em-up, like, I could do, like, like, uh, that Tekken Fighting Mode from Tekken 3.
147125	149105	And, um, yeah.
152786	159487	But, um, I, um, I actually haven't played Phantasy Star Universe yet either because, um,
160735	162256	I've been doing real life things.
162516	163096	Well, you're in luck.
163136	169599	I heard the beta was extended, which again will do the Sunday listeners no good because it's extended through Saturday, but that's what I'm hearing.
169659	170359	It doesn't mean no good.
170880	171960	Well, unless I want to play tonight.
171980	173301	I think you can play something tonight.
173821	174081	Yeah.
174381	176982	I'm actually gaming gaming tomorrow.
177042	177823	Like old school D&D?
177863	178663	Like, no.
178763	179183	Roll D20?
179343	180044	Werewolf.
180344	181344	Oh, God, you nerd.
181484	182565	I game every other week.
182925	187627	Yes, everybody, not only am I a video gaming girl, I do tabletop gaming too.
189707	193568	Which just, you know, further cements you as a hardcore nerd.
194168	198049	I know what a D4 is used for in second edition D&D, bitches.
198909	199850	Nerd patrol, nerd patrol.
199870	200590	You can use it for a whip.
200650	201650	Nerd herd, nerd herd.
202370	203451	Uh, Loki, how you doing?
203471	204191	How was your gaming week?
204651	206391	It was short, I guess.
207912	211073	Um, well, I played Grand Theft Auto.
211713	215034	I didn't get to play any of the PlayStation 2 games that I have lined up to play.
215054	215454	Okay.
216650	220072	I don't get to play a lot of games right now because I'm packing, and packing sucks.
220913	226396	But I am looking forward to playing The Warriors, which is coming out on the PSP pretty soon.
226777	228958	Well, probably next year.
229638	232600	Yes, it was a movie, and it was an awesome PlayStation 2 game too.
233741	236403	So yeah, lots of Grand Theft Auto, and I'm kicking ass in that.
237043	239185	And Zuma a little bit.
239305	241126	I'm on level 9 now.
241746	245969	I beat level 8 while Nellie was asleep because she couldn't get past it and she was getting frustrated.
246567	250612	But she says she has to beat it herself before, or else it doesn't count.
250692	251133	I don't know.
251473	251834	So whatever.
253720	260743	And then I played a little Dig Dug, and I was trying to play some Luminous Live, but it won't download for me because it stops at 1%.
261603	265364	Xbox has been having some wacky stuff today ever since their maintenance yesterday.
266305	268045	And what did their maintenance do?
268105	269786	It's just stuff for their website from what I hear.
269906	275988	Well, we don't really know the full scope of things yet, so possibly they've done some type of upgrade that's dormant until later.
276028	277369	They broke Luminous Live.
277409	278929	That's what their update was for.
280050	280330	I don't know.
280917	283179	Oh, and of course, Saints Row.
283219	285821	I've been playing lots of Saints Row, and that's fun.
286161	292526	I'm trying for the million dollar achievement right now, and once I get that, then I'll kind of move on.
292546	295808	Yeah, that's pretty much it for now.
297293	298453	Some comments from our chat room.
298493	300114	We do have a small crowd there tonight.
300134	304215	A little smaller than our usual Sunday show, but we say thank you to the loyalists who are there, as always.
305555	312697	JeremyTodd1, in response to DarkSakura being a hardcore nerd, says, Tabletop gaming is for people who aren't hardcore enough to play video games.
314117	314737	I do both.
315618	317118	That means I'm double hardcore.
317678	321079	SSJ100Matt says, Jesus saves and rolls D20s.
321799	322039	Get it?
322239	323279	That's a role-playing joke.
323700	324900	Did Jesus make a saving throw?
325400	325520	Um...
325953	327156	Let's see, my gaming week.
327777	329762	I've been playing more of the Phantasy Star Universe beta.
329982	330724	I will say this.
330804	335275	Those of you guys that got frustrated with connection issues and things of that sort and getting started...
336073	345742	May not have given the game enough opportunity, because I'll tell you what, when I got in a party with some of my real-life friends and we were able to do voice chat, the game got like 5,000 times better.
346202	348024	I'm looking forward to the commercial release.
348064	349465	I'm definitely going to pick up the commercial release.
349785	358913	I'm still going to hold off on a full review of the game until I actually have a commercial release in my hands to review, but we will talk more about Phantasy Star Universe at a later date.
359870	362592	Meanwhile, I downloaded Luminous Live today.
362652	369037	I was able to grab it this morning, I guess maybe before the masses were getting home from work, school, and started downloading on Luminous Live.
370278	371239	So I picked that up.
372420	374021	I want to warn you about something with Luminous Live.
374822	376564	The game's got microtransactions out the butt.
377404	387833	And when I say that, I mean when you download the game, you can play Xbox Live, you can play normal challenge mode with about, I want to say it's about 12 skins.
387933	389434	Forgive me if I'm a little off on that number.
390077	396380	But if you want to buy more skins, like you want to get a pack of 20 skins, you're going to have to buy those later in what's called an advanced pack.
397080	409006	Also, if you go into play versus CPU, you only get one skin, and once you play that for about 10 levels, it says, thanks for trying this, buy the versus CPU pack if you want more.
409801	411722	Then in the mission mode, you get about five missions.
412042	413723	Hey, if you want more missions, buy the mission pack.
413743	414743	Then what the hell's the demo?
414863	417684	I mean, seriously, if this is the actual game, then what's the demo?
417704	418505	I guess it's one stage of the game.
418525	428849	So pretty much the game you're getting on Xbox Live is just the skeleton game of, you know, the non-stop puzzle mode with about 12 different skins and the ability to play on Xbox Live.
430130	430730	Oh, goody!
431070	437733	But, you know, I guess they'll have 700 songs on Xbox Live at some point for a microtransaction of $100 each.
438474	439254	Then maybe you'll get the
440666	443347	I can have this go with my Gran Turismo HD.
447010	455295	It's hard for me to sit here and be critical of Gran Turismo HD for the microtransaction things they've been talking about and not apply the same logic to Luminous.
455415	456775	I don't think that would be okay for me to do.
457156	465140	As much as I love Luminous, and I think it's an awesome puzzle game, I don't think it's fair for folks to be picking up Luminous when they don't really know what they're really buying.
465301	465781	I don't think...
466420	473342	Q Entertainment and Microsoft have been very upfront about what exactly you're getting with this and the fact that some components of the game are missing.
473822	474922	Are you getting a full game?
475202	475482	Yes.
475962	478163	Are you getting the same thing as you got on the PSP?
478543	478743	No.
478843	483824	The PSP version as it stands right now offers more than the basic skeleton that Xbox Live is giving you.
485665	489246	I don't feel like I can give this game a fair assessment until I know it's real price for everything else.
489306	492747	Would it have been a little bit different if the game were like $5 instead of $15 out the gate?
495814	500957	Maybe, but again, I would take all that into consideration with how much is each little component priced.
501057	508800	For example, Test Drive Unlimited was kind of using that formula, basically putting out a very cheap game and then having microtransactions.
509260	515483	But the difference between Test Drive Unlimited and, say, Gran Turismo HD or Luminous is you don't need to purchase those.
516003	520225	Granted, I bought this game because, well, I'm a cheapen point whore and I like
520836	522898	Hey, maybe not everyone wants to play mission mode.
550396	552537	Hey, maybe not everyone wants to play Puzzle Mode.
553338	559141	Okay, but still, you have to take the value of what you're paying out in consideration with all this.
559201	566865	For right now, for a pretty competitive $29.99, you can get the PSP version of Luminous, which offers more skins.
567406	574550	As it stands right now, better songs, as far as I'm concerned, even though, yes, some of the songs in Xbox Live's version are from Luminous 1.
575110	578552	Some of the best songs in Luminous 1 are nowhere to be seen so far in Xbox Live.
578885	582248	or if you have a Playstation 2 just wait and pick up Luminous Plus for 30 bucks when that comes out
593682	611170	by the way, the Madonna song, any licenses whatsoever, nowhere to be seen yet I don't know if they're going to be in the Advance Pack rumor has it, they're not I have someone who's had a peek at the Advance Pack and tells me that there's just more general Q Entertainment produced songs in there
611690	613932	from the first and probably second games combined.
613952	615693	Nice bait and switch there, Q Entertainment.
615793	619917	So I don't know where Madonna is or any licensed artist for that matter.
620217	620878	That could change.
620918	622139	Keep in mind that's on rumor there.
622479	628764	But I'm assuming that'll be another buy later on if you want to have Madonna or what have you in your game.
629645	631186	So, interesting.
631926	640093	Yeah, well, I remember reading, I know, and I gotta pull this up because I pulled up a different article, same type of thing, but they were talking about other additional
640649	642330	Downloads Beyond the Advance Pack.
642831	648555	And I want to say it was a run on 1UP, but I can't remember what they were showing.
648855	650256	No, here we go.
651437	653238	I know they had a ton of micropayment stuff.
653258	659523	And of course they were talking about the Advance Pack, but they were talking about other things that you can download as well.
660464	660964	Let's see here.
661024	664367	It says... Oh, they're just talking about, I guess, the mission and puzzle mode.
664387	666488	They're assuming that each one's going to be about...
668018	669039	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
686684	687986	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
706948	711233	Even if the music is not as good as the PSP version, I wouldn't go tell you to buy a PSP just for Luminous.
711654	715519	So I would say it's worth checking out if you don't have a PSP.
715939	720065	But if you do have a PSP... Yeah, so...
721595	724956	Anyway, let's get into some housekeeping real quick for tonight.
725496	732098	Tonight's housekeeping, first off, it's only going to be a one-part show tonight because of the fact that we are pre-taping and usually those only end up being one part.
732998	736999	I do want to point out we will still be doing DDR previews tonight even though it is only one part.
738059	746381	And remember, we're not live, so if you've joined our chat room on this lovely Sunday evening or whenever you used to listen to us live, keep in mind that we are pre-taped this week.
746801	750622	I also do have a message from one of our lesbians.
751038	751298	Yes?
751799	753800	Kristen would like everyone to know she says hi.
754360	754761	All right.
755341	756842	So you're hanging out with her this weekend, right?
756922	757442	Yes, I am.
757462	759304	It's a whole cluster of people going to YaoiCon.
759664	762506	We averted a crisis, but she did want me to tell all the listeners hi.
762726	762966	All right.
763026	763466	Sounds good.
764447	764647	All right.
764667	766829	We're going to start to get into some gaming news tonight.
767129	767829	We've got one more thing.
767929	768209	Oh, yes.
768590	769210	The contest.
769230	769791	The Battlefield.
769871	770431	I'm so sorry.
770451	771312	The Battlefield contest.
771352	771792	Who won?
772012	773393	We do have a winner.
773713	774834	There was lots of entries.
775393	777074	But there could only be one.
777214	778655	There could be only one.
778675	779215	Your mom.
779656	780856	Drumroll, please.
782557	784218	And the winner of the Battlefield 2142.
784258	787500	I don't remember which year it was.
787520	789141	Get the game name right, please.
789161	794724	Battlefield 2142 contest is Jason Tryon from St.
794804	796285	Petersburg, Florida.
796686	797806	Congratulations.
797846	798627	Congratulations.
798667	802349	You'll be getting an email with your download code to download the full game.
803519	807801	with maybe a few additional extras that we will be talking about a little bit later.
808041	809061	Yay!
809142	810142	Congratulations.
810722	813123	Wait, do I have my sound effect loaded here?
813183	813483	Hold on.
814824	815384	There we go.
815724	819166	Congratulations to you from us here at Orange Launch Radio.
820286	821767	We actually have breaking news tonight.
821907	826751	I'm going to interrupt our usual show role here because here at Orange Lounge Radio we try to plan our stories in advance.
826791	830814	We literally got breaking news about 15 minutes before we went live tonight.
831194	838359	And for longtime fans of Orange Lounge Radio who listened to us back in our music gaming days, we know a lot of you folks are still with us.
838379	839300	This is huge news.
839961	841301	Directly from OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
842802	846565	There's a press release today on Roxor's website, and it was short and simple.
847065	858752	Konami Corporation, developer of the Dance Dance Revolution video game, and Roxor Games Inc., developer of the In the Groove dance games, today announced the mutual settlement of the litigation between the parties in the U.S.
858792	861373	District Court in the Eastern District of Texas.
861874	868478	Under the terms of the settlement, Konami has acquired the intellectual property rights to the In the Groove dance game franchise.
868838	870819	It was further agreed as a part of the settlement that
870959	874381	that Rockshore would respect Konami's intellectual property rights.
875321	875961	Translation?
876482	876962	Pwned.
898073	898795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
904491	906513	It would be a DDR PC, too.
906913	910356	Now, granted, there may be more information forthcoming later.
910496	911117	Who knows?
911477	915040	Perhaps Konami will re-explore the PC market with the In the Groove franchise.
915100	915500	Who knows?
915921	923227	I mean, I'm not going to say for sure I'm the end-all, be-all, know-all of what's going on, but in my mind, that kind of makes the most sense for Konami.
923247	924888	Why dilute the market with more dance games?
924908	925749	Just make it all DDR.
925849	930513	Well, so they'll put out that patch, though, for In the Groove, if they didn't know that they were going to be...
931195	932136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
951657	952157	They went down.
952338	953418	I think they knew that was happening.
953598	955799	And now you have this nice relic on your wall.
955879	956079	I do.
956099	959801	We have a signed Indigroove 2 poster from last year's Digital Life.
960241	961862	That'll go for millions on eBay next week.
962122	962783	Yeah, right.
962863	963603	I'm kidding.
963643	964704	Millions of pennies.
964824	973108	Here's a little something else, though, for those arcade owners out there with an Indigroove machine with this update on it.
974048	975749	If the RIA catches you...
977545	981547	And for a lot of money.
982007	988269	So keep that in mind with this wonderful unlocked machine if you want to.
988369	991310	I mean, you can get sued, so there you go.
991610	993150	What if the arcade has a jukebox license?
993911	995151	If they do, but not many do.
995331	1000653	So most of them think, okay, I'm safe because I've got the game's music is licensed.
1001133	1003554	That doesn't include stuff that people load on there, so...
1004850	1006931	Well, more to come on this as it develops.
1007331	1010233	Here at Orange Lounge Radio, we would like to open an invitation.
1010393	1014875	We know there are folks in the music game industry who listen to this program.
1015516	1020679	If anyone from Rocks or Games would like to come on the show, present their side of things, the door is open.
1021179	1026562	If anyone from Konami would like to come on the show and talk about the future of In the Groove now that they've got it, the door is open.
1027162	1029303	You can go to the contact us on our website.
1029703	1030864	We'd love to have you on the program.
1031516	1036498	That is awesome now that I have the Indie Group 2 beta for PlayStation 2 because that will never be released now.
1036738	1037578	Probably not.
1037858	1039559	Never say never, but probably not.
1040119	1041879	All right, back to the normal list of topics.
1042240	1058205	Anyways, speaking of stuff that we think will never be released, and that would be a working firmware for the PSP, but the next big firmware update, 3.0, is coming, and supposedly coming tomorrow or the 19th for most people out there.
1058846	1061307	Anyways, what does that mean to you?
1061447	1077976	Well, if this is the big old firmware story that we've been waiting for, it's going to have the PlayStation emulation in there as well as support for linking up to the PlayStation 3 for remote play, whatever the hell that is supposed to be.
1078136	1080438	But I guess we'll find out when the PlayStation 3 comes out.
1080978	1084760	And it's not a big surprise that that is coming out tomorrow, seeing as...
1085696	1096524	and Sony is having their Gamers Day for basically covering all the PlayStation 3 stuff and PSP stuff on Thursday.
1096645	1097625	So that's pretty cool.
1098566	1106852	And yeah, so lots of big stuff and I'm sure a lot more ways to stop you from running homebrew software.
1106952	1108654	So enjoy.
1108674	1112917	And I'm sure this will be on the next Grand Theft Auto anyway, so I'd have to update no matter what.
1116148	1125875	All right, well, something that's kind of interesting in the Sony area, now this isn't really officially supported by Sony, but, you know, we've been talking about, you know, high definition.
1125895	1127837	High definition is like the next gen of gaming.
1128137	1131900	Well, did you know that you could do high definition with your PlayStation 2?
1132780	1135963	Yes, that's right, there is a boot disk that's out there.
1136443	1146032	and it's from, let's see, it's called the Exploder HD TV Player and it's by a company called Silicon Era or at least that's the, I'm sorry, no, that's the website that originally ran this story.
1146352	1148093	It's actually Exploder I think is the company.
1148174	1149034	Exploder is the company.
1150335	1163287	It says here that what you can do is that if you have a 1080i supporting TV, you can load this tool before starting the game and then what you can do is inside the menus you can select which resolution you want to run the game at and that
1163567	1163787	Blinkast
1182645	1185446	Kinda, but this isn't for a specific game.
1185746	1194488	Well, no, I understand that, but they were wanting to do something very similar to use the better graphics processing of the Dreamcast to play other PlayStation games, too.
1194908	1196329	I think it's sort of along the same lines.
1198850	1201510	So, I still don't know if this is something I would pick up, though.
1201530	1209412	It just seems a little too risky to me, and I don't know if the PlayStation 2 game was not designed for high def, it's going to be kind of funky in this transition, so I don't know if that's something I want.
1209432	1209933	Why?
1209953	1211413	The PlayStation 3 is doing the same thing.
1212099	1213120	Okay, why not?
1213160	1214781	So, I mean, it could happen.
1214841	1216163	I mean, who knows?
1216303	1217404	Stranger things, I guess.
1217524	1217964	Alright.
1219205	1233317	Well, since you brought up the PS3, there actually is a little bit more news about the Blu-ray discs and the developers that are working on them, that they're actually close to the 25 gigabyte limit for a lot of the games.
1233618	1233798	And, um,
1234910	1239552	There's a lot of talk that we're putting movies in there, non-interactive content.
1240213	1247676	And we pretty much have an admission on that from one of the folks with Sony.
1250978	1258321	Actually, the one to speak with was Phil Harrison, who was the World Studio guy.
1259081	1261803	But basically...
1263090	1269575	What he said, and this is a quote, is, I see nothing wrong with having non-interactive full HD sequences as part of the game.
1270056	1272838	That's all part of the production value and experience you get when you buy the game.
1272898	1274339	I don't see that as a weakness at all.
1275880	1279443	It's a weakness if it's going to cut down on game time and playability.
1280264	1290952	I think it's a lot of the stuff is, because they are outporting the 1080p, a lot of it's just higher res textures, or in the case, you know, you've got, you know, they were
1291479	1320944	High def video and stuff in there Which, you know, some of that's fine But, and also, they could be doing less compression on it Because Blu-ray drives are slower So, you know, because they are slower Well, actually, you would think they would do more compression If they had, you know, slower Blu-ray, whatever I'm no developer, so what the hell do I know about content All I know is, you know, 25 gigs is a lot for a game And it better damn look good for, you know, 25 gigs That's all I gotta say Wait till they have to deal with the 50 What are we gonna see then?
1322003	1323004	More movies.
1323224	1324064	Defective discs.
1324625	1327186	Hopefully a PlayStation 3 that'll take out my trash and do my dishes.
1328707	1329287	Then I'd buy it.
1330488	1330928	At launch.
1331248	1333530	New for PS3, TurboTax!
1334750	1335231	Anyways.
1336151	1341074	Some really cool stuff, though, coming to the PlayStation 3, and this is also coming out of Sony's Gamer Day.
1342301	1348142	First off, their brand new e-distribution titles, or their Sony Arcade, whatever the hell you want to call it.
1349083	1350323	Some pretty cool stuff, actually.
1351463	1361185	Very interesting ones, like for example, there's a new game that kind of resembles Geometry Wars, which is kind of neat, called Blast Factor.
1362105	1370167	There's going to be Lemmings 2, which apparently is not a port of the original Lemmings 2, but is a brand new Lemmings game, updated graphics and whatnot.
1371292	1376257	Go Sudoku, because, god, there's just not enough Sudoku out there.
1377698	1381442	Swizzle Blocks, which I don't know what that is, but it sounds like a puzzle game.
1381943	1389391	Criminal Crackdown, and, well, Flow, because that was previously announced.
1390185	1391906	I saw some of the screenshots for some of these games.
1391926	1392606	It looked interesting.
1393586	1395087	Blast Factor looked pretty cool.
1395467	1399108	And the graphics looked pretty pristine on it.
1399148	1402249	So I don't know if it's just the TV or screenshots that they're showing.
1402929	1411171	I'm hoping out of this Gamers Day thing that will have already happened by the time most of you hear this, we will see a little more in the means of footage.
1412252	1413672	Not so much screenshots, but actual footage.
1413712	1415053	Kind of what they look like in action.
1415153	1419214	You know what I wish they had is a console that's just these mini-games.
1419434	1420114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1449522	1455344	Pretty lame, but actually the case reminded me of something that would be in like Half-Life 2 or something.
1455685	1457125	And I like the glowing light on the front.
1457165	1458826	But that's all I liked about the Phantom.
1459146	1461827	And I wouldn't touch that fucking lap board with a 10-foot pole.
1464048	1470411	Alright, well for those that were worried that they may not get a hand on a PlayStation 3 this year, you should probably still be a little bit worried.
1470491	1476853	But it is said that they are on target to produce 1 million PlayStation 3s in 2006.
1478895	1479815	I was wrong.
1507481	1512603	Yes, and I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is still launching spring of 2006, like they previously said.
1513723	1518485	I do think the machine's going to launch, but I think we're going to see Xbox 360 shortages all over again.
1519486	1521126	I'm not too disappointed.
1521166	1523527	I don't really need one at launch this time next year.
1523587	1524488	Yeah, I'll probably have one.
1524868	1528189	Honestly, the only reason I feel like I should own one of these at launch is because of the show.
1528489	1529870	But I'll just go to Jamie's house and play hers.
1530870	1535312	We can see if that 1080p is worth a damn, since my TV will run it.
1535872	1536012	Yep.
1537186	1537847	You know what, though?
1538367	1540289	I think I'm still just going to use it as a paperweight.
1541750	1542291	Well, we'll see.
1542771	1543112	We'll see.
1543832	1548977	Well, speaking of things to see, I do have a list of release dates for our buddies in the UK.
1550198	1554302	On the 26th is Anos 1701 for PC.
1555182	1562229	A bunch of other stuff on the 27th, and I'm not going to list all the systems they're on because there's a few multiple releases.
1562933	1572499	but there's Action Loop, Blade Dancer, Lineage of Light, Dark Messiah, Might and Magic, Dragon Ball Z, Tenkaichi Budokai 2, Dragon Warriors Vol.
1572840	1589971	2, FIFA 07, Ford Street Racing, LA Duel, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, Metal Slug, Metal Slug Anthology, Myst Ultimate Compilation, NBA 2K7, blah, blah, blah, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, Pipa Funnel, Pipa Funnel 2 on GBA, by the way, Pipa Funnel, Take the Reins,
1590883	1611582	Prince of Persia Trilogy, Pro Evolution Soccer 6, Sudoku Master, Sims 2, Pets, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent, Warhammer 40k, War of Dawn, Dark Crusade, Zoo Tycoon 2, Marine Mania, and on the 31st Legend of Spyro, A New Beginning.
1612043	1613224	Although I'd just rather go trick-or-treating.
1615226	1616527	Spyro's not that bad.
1617554	1622979	Spyro is an in-joke on Spyro's message board that I moderate on.
1624660	1627242	I'm going to be seeing Warp 11 on that day, so screw Spyro.
1628203	1628983	Nerd!
1629003	1631806	Did you get any more nerdier tonight?
1632066	1633527	I'm going to go see a Trekkie band.
1633547	1634748	Are you wearing a pocket protector?
1635088	1635308	No.
1637810	1638911	I do have a chainmail bra.
1640232	1641413	La la la la la.
1642494	1644515	So there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week.
1644916	1644996	Um...
1645996	1654982	We've actually got some pretty cool stuff, like, for example, Marvel Ultimate Alliance will be coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the 360, and I believe the PSP as well.
1655922	1661145	Some other fun games, Reservoir Dogs, the ultra-violent game, will be on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
1661766	1666108	We've got Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube.
1667149	1673753	Nicktoons Battle for Volcano Island on PlayStation 2, GameCube DS, and Game Boy Advance.
1674694	1680518	And of course, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam will be coming out on the DS and Game Boy Advance.
1681119	1682119	So that should be pretty neat.
1683020	1690586	And of course, for you RPG fans, we've got Phantasy Star Universe coming out on PlayStation 2, PC, and on the 360.
1692487	1693748	And other fun stuff.
1694628	1698751	Well, these are a little bit way off now, and even more way off than we mentioned last week.
1699992	1702434	I unfortunately have to give you guys the bad news that
1703035	1707898	DDR Universe has been delayed into March of 2007.
1708698	1709739	How do you know this?
1710379	1710979	From my work.
1711239	1711700	Alright.
1711780	1713601	It's from Konami themselves.
1713861	1714221	Alright.
1714881	1718163	So, you know, I'm not surprised because all their other games... Could they change it back?
1719043	1720124	It could very well change back.
1720304	1724206	I don't think it will change back because that's a pretty large jump there.
1724306	1726227	So, yeah.
1726307	1727868	I would see March because it makes sense.
1727888	1731430	I mean, it's just like Beatmania last year, so no big deal.
1732001	1735707	There have been some price drops on some 360 games in case you're interested.
1735967	1737249	You know what though, I want to say real quick.
1737429	1741154	For folks that were very critical of DDR Universe's build at E3...
1741943	1744444	That could actually be good news that they went back and retooled some things.
1744624	1747926	Because you know a lot of people were bitching about the interface on Universe and things like that.
1748346	1756690	Remember, when people complained about Ultramix 2, they went back and retooled it, and that came out, in my mind, still the best DDR home release they've done yet.
1756930	1762432	So, I'm not saying they are, I don't know, but that could be good news.
1762572	1764613	I'd rather them wait and get it right.
1765514	1767595	Alright.
1767715	1770076	Or they're putting in the groove songs in it.
1770993	1771695	Just kidding, no.
1772737	1774982	A few price drops here.
1776499	1779821	Hitman Blood Money for the 360s dropped down to $39.99.
1780061	1784723	Every other version for Hitman Blood Money has actually dropped $10, so that's pretty good.
1785344	1790727	Tomb Raider Legends dropped down to $29.99 for the 360, and all the other versions have dropped also $10.
1791167	1799011	And finally, Condemned, which wasn't that expensive to begin with, and actually was $39.99 for a while now, is now $29.99.
1799511	1801813	So if you haven't picked it up yet, probably a good time to do it.
1802913	1804414	Because it is the only Survivor Horror...
1804978	1807179	Game pretty much on the 360.
1808500	1810481	Comments in our chat room on Spyro.
1810942	1816405	Jeremy Todd 1 says, I remember I had a Spyro game for the GBA and I got stuck on the 4th or 5th world and then I gave it away.
1817886	1820928	Sephiroth 1215 says, Spyro is now voiced by Elijah Wood.
1821168	1823169	I guess further proof he's jumped the shark.
1823529	1825410	SSJ100 Matt says, Spyro needs to end.
1825451	1827812	It's time for him to grow up and burninate the countryside.
1829338	1829678	There you go.
1829738	1836261	Well, I was going to mention also, there was a game that actually came out last week, or this week, depending on when you're listening to this show, I guess.
1837882	1839082	Splinter Cell Double Agent for the 360.
1839462	1847646	It is going to be one of the first titles that will support the brand new fall dashboard update for the 360, and it will support 1080p.
1848546	1849266	So that's pretty sweet.
1850727	1853568	We'll have to see how sexy that looks on a TV that can support it.
1853908	1854068	Yes.
1854228	1855509	Again, we'll be going over to Jamie's house.
1856906	1857446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1877537	1877917	Nizu no Senritsu 2
1901469	1904394	Princess Princess comes out from Marvelous Entertainment.
1904454	1905676	It's also an adventure game.
1906356	1917753	I noticed the cover has these three anime-looking chicks who I would speculate might be the princesses in this game, although there's two princesses in that title and three on the box, so I don't know.
1918474	1924496	Also coming out from D3 is Mermaid Prism, another adventure game coming out October 26th.
1925096	1932279	And lastly on my list here we have Utoware Rumono, yet another adventure game, but this one coming to us from Aqua Plus.
1933539	1934860	Check that out this week in Japan.
1935980	1936360	Sweet.
1937040	1938841	Is that Utoware?
1939721	1940322	Oh, probably.
1941102	1942802	Why do I do the Japanese releases?
1942862	1946144	I've never taken a lick of a Japanese class.
1946344	1946964	I think we need to.
1947660	1950401	I mean, I love our UK people, but I can't trade.
1950501	1951321	I love them, too.
1952401	1952981	Let me at them.
1953421	1954602	I love our Japanese people, too.
1954782	1955062	All right.
1955782	1959263	We'll talk that up behind the scenes, because you've actually had Japanese class, so I butchered those words.
1960723	1961563	I was just wondering.
1961623	1962043	I openly admit.
1962084	1963744	I can't see through you.
1964104	1969305	I just did the Japanese release dates because they were lonely and needed some love.
1969465	1972366	No one was talking about them anywhere, so, you know.
1974053	1977535	I took them into my home and I sheltered them, even if I did horribly butcher their names.
1980217	1982579	And releasing in Antarctica, nothing.
1983219	1983800	Sorry, guys.
1984900	1993726	However, being released in nowhere is actually... Speaking of things that aren't actually going to be making it out, I should say.
1993746	1994747	The...
1997808	2007070	Major UK retailers, Curry's and Dixon's, are not going to be stocking Canis Canem Edit, which, for those of us in the U.S., is a bully.
2009350	2012831	One of their spokespeople said, We have no plans to stock Canis Canem Edit.
2013291	2019592	We are fully aware people will be able to buy this game elsewhere, but we feel this game is not appropriate for Curry's family-friendly image.
2021292	2021552	Eat it.
2022212	2022852	It's Latin, right?
2023533	2023833	Okay.
2024833	2025793	I don't think they take Latin.
2027130	2029010	You do the Japanese words, I'll do the Latin words.
2029070	2029470	There we go.
2030831	2031351	Whatever.
2032851	2033291	Anyways.
2034251	2036912	Orange Lounge Radio, we are high school graduates.
2037432	2040012	Anyway, it's going to be out October 27th.
2040132	2043733	It has a 15 rating.
2044393	2045273	It's not that bad of a game.
2045313	2046313	It got really good reviews.
2046634	2054835	And apparently the character at the end, spoiler alert, becomes an upstanding citizen who gives more than he takes.
2055579	2057340	and makes out with boys as well as girls.
2057420	2057961	Is this true?
2058981	2061243	I think there are certain characters that you can make out with.
2061323	2062443	I need to get this game.
2063504	2064124	No, thank you.
2064164	2065345	The kid's, what, 15?
2065485	2066006	No, thank you.
2067106	2067727	Anyways.
2070208	2072810	So, anyways, Grand Theft Auto 4.
2073310	2074451	Again, it's way off.
2074471	2076472	It's supposed to be coming out in October of next year.
2076492	2077533	Like a year from now, yeah.
2077933	2079754	And I cannot wait, but no, anyways.
2080434	2084437	The PlayStation 3 is also getting exclusive episodic content.
2086710	2087430	Okay, listen now.
2087850	2092471	Rockstar, do you know what the word exclusive means?
2093191	2096812	It means one system Getty, the other system no Getty.
2097132	2097872	So you know what?
2098672	2102273	Maybe both Getty some content.
2102413	2102633	Okay.
2103353	2108774	Anyways, so both of them will have online... Don't ever read children's story time books.
2109014	2111215	Don't ever do that because you can't do it.
2112575	2112835	Shut up.
2113345	2116487	She can't speak Latin, I can't speak Japanese, and you can't read to children.
2116547	2116907	It's fine.
2117747	2121590	Anyways, so, yeah, it's going to get episodic content, not a big surprise.
2122010	2126032	And what might be different is the content might be different for each platform.
2126252	2126592	Who knows?
2126852	2130414	My guess, no, because they are lazy, so it will be the same on both platforms.
2130534	2131155	I think you're wrong.
2131655	2142201	I think it's like Soul Calibur 2, where you had one character on the... I'm not saying literally this is it, but you know how you had Link on the GameCube and Spawn on the Xbox and Hachi on the PlayStation?
2142641	2145364	and it was, you know, that was their exclusive content per console.
2145665	2154274	I think what you're going to get in Grand Theft Auto is you're going to get, like, you know, West Island on the PlayStation and East Island on the Xbox.
2154855	2155636	And the Wii gets nothing.
2157017	2163284	Rob, if you've ever played the multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, they're lazy.
2163817	2165758	They're not going to make new content.
2166118	2169299	We'll be lucky if the original content works correctly.
2169319	2174261	If we have to wait a goddamn year for the game, I would think they have enough time to make West Island and East Island.
2176982	2178363	Westside and Eastside.
2178403	2179043	Exactly.
2179103	2179984	I was waiting for that.
2181684	2186046	Meanwhile, who won that Battlefield thing earlier in the show that was Jason from Florida?
2186756	2188017	Yeah, I think that was his name.
2216178	2219459	based on, you know, where you live and things of that nature.
2219479	2222259	It's kind of anonymously looking at your IP or what have you.
2222840	2228901	And, of course, everyone is going flipping nuts on forums about this, like, how dare EA spy on me?
2228921	2231621	This is an invasion of my privacy.
2232102	2235282	I was going to buy Battlefield 2142, but now I'm not.
2235582	2237043	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2237103	2238463	Loki, you had some strong opinions on this?
2238483	2238623	Yeah.
2238683	2239263	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2265084	2265965	Stuff like that.
2267365	2277771	Also, it's collecting information on how many views of said ad you have made so that they can go and bill whomever, their clients.
2278531	2284655	Our friend and pal and buddy VXChaseNXV in chat is jumping up and down screaming an IP address is not anonymous information.
2284735	2285415	Grr, argh.
2287415	2288515	Get over it, people!
2288615	2292076	Seriously, it's not like saying, we're collecting your credit card information.
2292336	2294557	We're going to be watching where you're browsing on the internet.
2294697	2296077	It's just a goddamn IP.
2296117	2297977	It's just figuring out where you are in the world.
2298117	2300198	I don't think EA is the first company to be watching you.
2300338	2301838	No, World of Warcraft.
2301898	2307279	Every time you sign into Xbox Live, Microsoft knows what you're playing, and they track it on the internet for your friends to see.
2307640	2313901	And World of Warcraft, you know, they monitor your computer for spyware, but oh my god, they could be monitoring for other things, you know.
2314933	2316058	It's just, whatever.
2316339	2319171	I used somebody's IP address to track down when I was being stalked.
2322352	2328454	Well, yeah, I mean, you could... They might be collecting your IP address, but they're just using that for this.
2328474	2329655	I don't think they care where your house is.
2329675	2331356	Yeah, I don't think they're going to come knock on your door.
2331656	2333296	Sir, you've been playing too much of our game.
2333797	2337658	They don't care that you've been looking at porn all the day.
2337778	2349843	What they should have done, I guess, what would be the happy medium here, is have you sign up on their website or whatever, putting your address information in there, and then you don't have to have your IP tracked.
2350202	2354584	because they'll go off that address and send you ads based on where you live via that.
2354864	2358685	DMN says, but this allows for date people and insert zip code here.
2358725	2359506	That shit's annoying.
2359826	2361546	Microsoft doesn't hit you with shitty ads.
2361647	2362067	Yes, they do.
2362947	2366008	Download our artist video of the month on Xbox Live this week.
2366568	2369970	Download Jaws from the Xbox Live Arcade because no one else is.
2371130	2372011	Buy a Scion.
2372431	2375452	I just feel sorry for people in my home state.
2375987	2376988	XBOX Live Marketplace
2396874	2399516	What I think is interesting, though, let's look at the bigger picture here.
2399556	2400317	Loki, what do you think of this?
2400897	2408303	And the bigger picture that people are saying is bullshit, is that I'm paying $60, $50, whatever, for a game that has advertising in it.
2408683	2409504	That's too much money.
2409784	2412166	If the game has advertising in it, it shouldn't cost me that much money.
2413007	2414408	Does it cost you anything to play online?
2415909	2416750	No, it doesn't.
2417270	2417731	You know why?
2418051	2422775	Because that money that they're making from advertising helps run the servers.
2424524	2429626	I'm just surprised that someone with such a philosophy is actually kind of supporting this in a way.
2429666	2430446	It's kind of interesting.
2430466	2431867	I don't see a problem with it.
2432027	2433168	And to be honest, so what?
2433188	2436669	There's fucking ads on billboards that are in this world.
2436729	2447173	It's not like, you know, my character has a fucking, you know, date hot people or whatever in this zip code, you know, strapped to his body or something or whatever.
2447894	2449336	It's not like they're that obtrusive.
2449376	2450757	They're just on fucking billboards.
2451177	2459625	I don't notice what the hell are on billboards in the game, and if you're sitting there staring at the fucking billboard, you're probably going to get shot or stepped on by a giant robot.
2459745	2461727	So, whatever.
2463008	2468153	If you're really going to get your panties in a bunch for that, I don't want to see you playing Battlefield 2142 anyways.
2468433	2469454	Go play another game.
2470063	2473945	VX Jason says, give me the ability to run my own server and fuck your advertisements.
2474065	2476706	Do you think people are going to end up hacking this game to take the shit out?
2477226	2477846	Sure, why not?
2478386	2481507	They've done it before with other games, so I don't see why they couldn't.
2483088	2483408	All right.
2484109	2495033	Well, all this talk of privacy and invading our privacy and ruffling our feathers here, it's the internet versus EA and what have you, it makes us a little bit angsty.
2495613	2497834	So that means we have to bring on the FUs of the week.
2511060	2513622	This FU is dedicated toward erythromycin.
2514482	2523726	Yes, the antibiotic that they prescribe quite often for sinus infections, so I guess it really is rooted in my sinus infection that I'm still not, you know, done with.
2524666	2528588	But I would like to actually be able to digest solid food, please?
2529188	2529468	Drugs?
2529889	2533930	Hurry up and be done with me so that I can actually eat a pizza without wanting to die.
2534931	2535531	Not love me.
2538209	2548137	F you to my head hurting because I have a headache right now and it's one of those ones that's not really that bad but it's in the back of my skull and that sucks because there's no way to get rid of it.
2549478	2551619	So, fucking hate that and I get them so often.
2553481	2554081	It's from your neck.
2554321	2555042	It's from a tumor.
2556343	2557924	It's not a tumor.
2558164	2563188	F you to the fact that I'm getting on a red eye flight tomorrow night to New York City and I'm getting sick.
2563567	2565028	I can feel my body getting sick.
2565088	2568649	I know this because I was cold in my office all day and I usually don't get cold unless I'm getting sick.
2569189	2570150	So that's just great.
2570310	2572551	I'm getting sick to ruin my vacation in New York City.
2572931	2573551	Yay!
2573631	2574351	Joint excitement.
2574531	2575812	F you to viruses.
2575972	2576952	New York City!
2577413	2577693	Sorry.
2578193	2578573	Shut up.
2578633	2579193	Get a rope.
2582475	2583035	Anyways.
2585056	2585616	Moving on.
2588537	2592779	Well, speaking of things that are moving at least, we've got a...
2593806	2596007	Track listing for Elite Beat Agents.
2598227	2605069	So if anybody who is interested, and actually, again, the release for that is going to be November 6th over here in the U.S.
2605909	2622394	But the songs that are going to be in it is Walkie Talkie Man by Stereogram, ABC, Jackson 5, Sk8er Boi, Avril Lavigne, I Was Born to Love You, Queen, Rock This Town, Stray Cats, which is a great song, Highway Star, Deep Purple, YMCA, Village People, September, Earth, Wind & Fire,
2623329	2634033	Can't Heat, Jamiroquai, Material Girl, Madonna, Lala, Ashley Simpson, you're the inspiration, Chicago, you know I used to actually have that on a 45?
2634093	2634674	Nerd.
2639716	2641536	No, that just meant it was the 80s.
2642897	2648299	Survivor, Destiny's Child, Without a Fight, Hooba Stank, Believe, Cher, that's so gay.
2650194	2651515	Let's Dance, David Bowie.
2651715	2652375	I love David Bowie.
2652556	2656778	Jumpin' Jack Flash, Rolling Stones, Makes No Difference, Sum 41, The Anthem, Good Charlotte.
2658819	2668385	Well, this will certainly ruffle the feathers of those folks that were expecting to get more Japanese-style music, but if that's what you wanted, import Owen Don.
2668405	2670747	I don't know why they were expecting to get Japanese music.
2670807	2671527	Exactly.
2671667	2674209	So this is certainly an Americanized version.
2674269	2675830	It definitely is going to take this series in a
2676257	2677718	Completely different direction.
2679018	2679539	You know what?
2679919	2688183	Although there's a couple of songs on that list that made me go, you know, any music game is going to have a couple songs that made me go, so I'm okay with it.
2688243	2689163	I think it'll actually be fun.
2689183	2693065	There's some kind of funny songs on there, so it should be interesting to see it in this system.
2693085	2694325	I'm upset with this track list.
2694385	2694566	Why?
2695086	2703910	Because anytime that Cher song is seen anywhere with my eyes, it gets stuck in my head, and I can't get it out.
2705114	2710615	and I also think of that Margaret Cho act too where she was talking about it.
2710755	2713136	Yay, I know what game to play every time Jamie's over.
2713516	2714136	You know what?
2714296	2716056	I know which ass to kick every time I'm over.
2717396	2732299	Anyways, speaking of ass kicking, Red Octane or Activision have basically kicked the ass of any third-party guitar controller because according to the official PlayStation Magazine demo of Guitar Hero 2, they will not work.
2732740	2734800	So if that's indicative of the final game
2736125	2740507	Your third-party controller will no workie on the brand-new game.
2740627	2741547	So, that kind of sucks.
2741568	2742988	At least this is based on the demo, right?
2743228	2744609	Based on the demo, but you know what?
2744629	2746450	I mean, I don't know.
2746470	2750531	How hard could it be to, you know, get a controller to work?
2750571	2751112	I mean, seriously.
2751232	2753393	So, I don't know.
2753533	2753933	We'll see.
2753973	2763117	I'm sure people will find a workaround for that, but as of right now, that's kind of poopy, seeing as, you know, their Red Octane started off as a third-party, you know,
2763717	2767020	controller manufacturer, and now they're just kind of saying, fuck you all.
2768862	2771124	Yeah, so let me get this straight.
2771785	2781794	A company that got its start as a third-party peripheral manufacturer has effectively locked out third-party peripheral manufacturers from their latest games.
2784228	2785429	It's a hands of strike.
2786229	2790651	It's cutting out future competition for other third party... It's interesting.
2790691	2791572	It's an interesting tactic.
2791592	2792592	I mean, that's business.
2792933	2796734	You can hem and haw all you want about, you know, Red Octane are bastard people.
2796834	2798095	They're hypocrites, blah, blah, blah.
2798355	2799136	But that's just business.
2799276	2801497	There was basically the official controller.
2802217	2805679	They way kind of recognized it was an official controller is because they had...
2806319	2810520	The left button shorted out, kind of like how poppin' music has that.
2810940	2814701	They have a button shorted out to be able to detect that it's the official poppin' music controller.
2816201	2829664	What's interesting, though, is there was some speculation that this was to lock out those third-party wireless controllers because Red Octane was coming out with their own wireless Guitar Hero controller for the PlayStation 2.
2830864	2831344	Interesting.
2832310	2832470	Oh, joy.
2832510	2832670	Oh, joy.
2858817	2859778	Thank you for watching.
2859798	2860359	See you next time.
2882975	2883636	I am not doing this.
2883656	2884056	I am not doing this.
2900809	2917856	and then it's like supposed to be a surprise folks he's just being sheepish don't worry we'll have him there and root for him if you're in San Francisco I am not playing that damn game bring your Loki signs bring your you know like they have on the show Loki is my American Idol you know who we should take to that?
2918376	2929340	Iguana Girl we should but we'll take her to another city because I gotta have Loki win this one no Iguana Girl can go and be the real winner that's fine
2931084	2932085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2954625	2955065	I'm poor!
2955525	2956026	Anyways.
2956686	2957386	I'll sell the ferret.
2957766	2975773	If dancing is more of your thing, you'll be happy to know that the ever-rumored, you know, because everyone wanted a DDR MMO, well, Dave Perry, who you might remember from Shiny, is creating a new MMO called Dance, which is
2976363	2985552	Promising players will have a chance to create their own unique dancers, and through variable styles, facial features, and clothing and accessories, you can also be able to actually play.
2985672	2992960	It sounds very similar to, like, O2 Jam or something like that, but it should be pretty interesting.
2993020	2999126	Obviously, when I first read the news on this, it sounds very similar to one of those popular Korean music games, such as O2 Jam, R2-D2, one of those.
2999600	3000920	I'll check it out if it's free.
3000940	3001961	I mean, it can't be free, right?
3002061	3002801	Exactly.
3002841	3003081	You betcha.
3003101	3003301	You betcha.
3022628	3022789	See?
3022809	3023451	There you go.
3023511	3024132	There you go.
3031337	3037559	All right, well, every week you send us emails, and DarkSakura writes down your IPs with a big magic marker.
3037759	3040660	And then I lock them down to your zip code.
3040740	3043681	Sends them to the spam factory to send.
3043721	3044201	No, I'm just kidding.
3044221	3046822	Of course we never give out your emails, addresses, or IP.
3046862	3047882	We wouldn't do that to you.
3048462	3049222	We're not the man.
3049563	3051943	But we will read what you write to us on air.
3052283	3056565	Actually, I find where you live, and if your letter sucks, I leave stinky poo on your front doorstep.
3057045	3057505	Oh, I see.
3058632	3063756	Alright, well, hopefully we've got some letters that did not earn a poo-bombing this week.
3065577	3068280	DarkSakura, open up the mailbag and pull some emails out for us.
3069460	3079508	The first one comes from, well, it doesn't really have a name on it, so I'm just going to say Pendragon.
3082010	3083651	Actually, AIBO is not useless.
3084672	3086894	I've had this ERS-7 since they first came out.
3087250	3089972	He watches my house when I'm not there and he has his own blog on the web.
3090133	3092915	Meet Falco at fusioncrew.org.
3094076	3095017	That would be kind of funny.
3095557	3100221	I did want to get one at one point, but they're just too damn expensive.
3101642	3102243	I want an AIBO.
3103083	3104043	I'm in shock.
3104063	3107125	Someone wrote us to tell us they have an AIBO that has a blog.
3108105	3109786	My Xbox 360 has a blog.
3110026	3115789	I want an AIBO that has a blog and that we'll be walking around because it randomly takes pictures and stuff.
3115829	3120211	It's like, oh look, there's people having sex on the couch or something like that and posts a blog.
3120251	3122672	It would just get more pictures of your foot.
3125373	3130535	I'm going to start a PayPal account for myself to donate to DarkSakura's AIBO fund.
3131496	3131996	You do that.
3132878	3134099	Let's see if I get an AIBO.
3134999	3138201	Come on, chat room, you know you want to help me get an AIBO to replace the ferret.
3138221	3140643	Sell your goddamn TV, then you can afford an AIBO.
3140663	3142044	I'll get an AIBO and I'll name him Ferret.
3145046	3148068	Anyway, this is when I get my wireless router working the right way again.
3148108	3150829	You can email Falco and he'll take a picture and email it back to you.
3152150	3154472	And that's at AIBOFalco at Comcast.net.
3154672	3155552	So I think that's pretty funny.
3156513	3161476	So yeah, I'm going to... By the way, he wants us to pick him for the drawing, but I think it's a little too late.
3162705	3162885	GOMEZ
3181149	3187971	Hey Orange Lounge, this is the first time I've ever sent you guys an email because I'm kind of an Orange Lounge noob because I only started listening about episode 196.
3188671	3189612	Nice run on sentence.
3190052	3192833	Welcome to the show, I'm glad you've decided to stick around.
3194653	3197734	I love the show and the praise you give Xbox 360 LOL.
3198094	3201115	However, my friends and I have been having some problems with the system.
3201135	3208998	My controllers now have a mandatory tape job on the back of them to keep the batteries connected so the controller does not disconnect due to a loss of power, which makes me really mad.
3209580	3216246	But this doesn't compare to a friend of mine whose Xbox broke just recently, but Microsoft was generous enough to give him a new one, which within a week was also broken.
3216286	3220791	He had to endure another couple of months without an Xbox, even though he had just bought NHL 07.
3221692	3223633	Dude, you're like the king of run-on sentences.
3223673	3226456	This is awesome.
3227437	3234644	The system can be a hassle when it freezes on me or the controller is disconnected in the middle of a game or battle, but nothing makes me more mad than the controller disconnect.
3235447	3236870	and because of this my Xbox freezes.
3236950	3241258	Either way, I love my Xbox 360 because of the fantastic graphics and games and yet I hate the frustrations.
3241759	3242921	I guess I hate it and love it.
3243602	3244945	The other topic I have to say...
3246272	3250436	I had to say was to do with the new Phantasy Star Universe demo that came out to the marketplace recently.
3250896	3257061	Since I downloaded pretty much every demo I had to play, this one pretty much got me hooked, but not before some difficulty.
3257161	3266989	I originally made myself one of those robot guy characters and pretty much held the A button through the whole tutorial while talking to my friend, which I later found out was a mistake because I had never played these MMO games before.
3267350	3269671	So all I could do was walk around asking people, Hey, how do you battle?
3270192	3271593	Or do you know how to get money?
3272454	3274776	And my normal response would be...
3275476	3276417	No, go away, you noob.
3276437	3277217	You suck at this game.
3277237	3277658	Screw off.
3277758	3279058	And ah ha ha ha, yeah right, noob.
3279879	3280840	No, yeah right, what a noob.
3281060	3285182	Which did help me at all because I couldn't have any fun with this demo and made my gaming experience go down the drain.
3285503	3294048	However, I remembered Sky on your show mentioned something about being a girl in World of Warcraft and how he got lots of items and stuff for free, so I decided to give it a try.
3294488	3299792	I made a new account and made this girl human super hot with handlebars or pigtails or whatever you guys like to call them.
3300686	3304188	And once I entered the world, it was entirely, hello, how's it going?
3304548	3305929	Oh wow, you're really hot, let's go out.
3305989	3307410	And when I said, do you guys know how to battle?
3307670	3309231	Oh yeah, let's go, let me show you.
3309772	3314494	As a response, the guys showed me where to go and everything, even though I dissed them once I got into the battling world.
3315075	3320958	I am now given free money and items in script because I just have to say my mic is broken, so now I can just type everything I want to say to the players.
3321278	3324440	I never knew how many desperate gamer guys there really are out there.
3324861	3325741	Sincerely, Gomez.
3326362	3327042	I love this email.
3327864	3328945	I'm not playing a girl in PSO
3341542	3343523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3372793	3373974	Because you're a short, cute girl.
3374295	3379161	I have to say that the one male character I made back in PSO, though, was a...
3382737	3383277	and DarkSakura.com.
3411355	3416062	So that all these people will have to... You know, if that's how they want to spend their $10 a month, then fine.
3416362	3421248	But, you know, at least we'll filter out a lot of the lame-os that are just playing this because it's free.
3421769	3427697	They should have, like... Now, what I did mean to ask, though, you've still got your mags in that game, right?
3428358	3428478	No.
3428498	3428538	No.
3428993	3429133	P.S.U.
3429374	3429994	is beautiful.
3444958	3446159	I want my Opa Opa.
3446299	3449441	The first time I dual wielded sabers, I was like, oh God, I love this game.
3449521	3449781	Opa Opa.
3449801	3450321	I heard this game.
3450382	3450902	Opa Opa.
3451462	3453704	Unless I can make my pet an Opa Opa, then I'll be happy.
3453744	3454124	Okay, last email.
3454144	3455245	You can name it whatever you want.
3455285	3455845	Mine's named Opa Opa.
3455865	3457406	I want mine to look like an Opa Opa.
3457526	3459127	It kind of does, so name it Opa Opa.
3459287	3459487	Okay.
3459928	3460268	Email.
3460528	3461028	Last email.
3462069	3462970	This is from Mark.
3463410	3463790	Hey, guys.
3464711	3465091	You know what?
3465231	3466352	I think that that's sexist.
3467252	3467893	Okay, I'm just kidding.
3469794	3469894	Oh.
3469914	3469954	Oh.
3471526	3472666	I thought that was the email.
3472826	3473927	I was like, what?
3474287	3474927	Explain yourself.
3475047	3478267	I'm just curious as to why you released the podcast in two parts.
3478808	3485389	Is it that you can't get it all edited by Monday, or is it that you hope to get people to listen to the live broadcast instead of having to wait for the two parts?
3485729	3488830	To be honest, I will never listen to the live broadcast because I just don't have the time.
3489270	3490290	I hope you guys can change this.
3490590	3491990	Anyhow, great show as always.
3492050	3492570	Thanks, Mark.
3493190	3493991	Because we want to.
3494311	3494591	No, um...
3496846	3500469	Real... We did it at first because we were a little afraid.
3500509	3506173	We didn't know how the server would handle a two to three hour program being thrown out there all at once.
3506573	3509576	So we thought by breaking it up into chunks it wouldn't be so bad.
3510056	3512498	On our old server we used to have to worry about bandwidth a lot.
3512598	3514599	On this one we don't have to worry about that so much.
3515300	3519463	Hugs and kisses to our webmaster VXJasonXV who makes all this shit happen behind the scenes.
3520764	3520844	Um...
3521670	3522351	P-Break
3544201	3551469	Well, hypothetically, we could, when we break the show, just put a little... Bobby takes a break on his show, but he'll put a little noise in there.
3551489	3553251	He'll edit out his break and put a little noise in there.
3553292	3555775	Technically, we could do that, but I don't know.
3555815	3556896	It's just kind of what's worked for us.
3557356	3559018	We might change our minds later in the future.
3559159	3559499	I don't know.
3560260	3561982	But for right now, it's kind of what we're doing.
3563665	3565287	Email us if you feel strongly one way or the other.
3565307	3569051	Because I've heard from people that kind of like the fact that they get regular OLR content.
3569091	3569791	You won't this week.
3569811	3570872	There is no second part this week.
3571173	3573335	But a lot of folks like their regular OLR.
3573495	3574736	We're irregular this week.
3574956	3575537	Yes, that's right.
3576218	3576758	We're pregnant.
3578139	3579260	Is that it for emails?
3579281	3582644	Just because someone's pregnant doesn't mean that they have irregularity.
3582684	3583565	I'm just messing.
3583705	3585066	It just means they don't eat enough fiber.
3585266	3586007	I'm just messing.
3586047	3586347	Jeez.
3587228	3587929	Getting all angsty.
3589741	3590962	I already did the FUs of the week.
3591422	3593863	You're catching me mid-week after I got off of work.
3594083	3594844	Any more mailbag?
3595504	3595724	No.
3595945	3598206	Send us more mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
3598266	3599667	Give this woman more to read next week.
3599847	3600847	I need more stuff.
3601187	3601428	Right.
3601728	3602268	And give me money.
3603089	3614635	Anyways, there was an unconfirmed rumor this week, as every other week, that there may be a Blue Dragon anime series in the works.
3615515	3617597	And this is basically coming from...
3619397	3624819	You know, a toy hobby figurine page from a Japanese toy company.
3625800	3646768	And basically, you know, it wouldn't be that far of a stretch because it is created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and who is, you know, a brainchild of Final Fantasy and Dragon Ball Dragon Quest creator Akira Toyoyama Toyoyama, I mispronounced that.
3647669	3648549	So, you know,
3649224	3651185	Very strong ties to anime.
3651986	3653066	Well, maybe kind of neat.
3653426	3659710	But he also did all of the character designs for Chrono Trigger and... You said Akira Toriyama, right?
3660310	3660531	Yes.
3660771	3671497	Okay, yeah, he did all the character designs for Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger, so... And there has been short anime series for each, or segments of anime.
3672037	3672958	They have existed in anime form.
3672978	3674559	That was for a special edition!
3674879	3678341	Doesn't matter, they have existed in anime form at some point, so...
3679212	3679372	Huh.
3679872	3680032	Yeah.
3680373	3682133	So I guess we'll have to see.
3682934	3686215	Because right now it's just rumor.
3686456	3691198	You know, if Microsoft can have their Viva Pinata show here, why can't they have a Blue Dragon anime there?
3691798	3692939	I'd rather have Blue Dragon.
3693019	3694259	Viva Pinata sucks.
3695540	3697141	I watched the thing on Xbox.
3697181	3698041	It wasn't The End of the World.
3698141	3699342	It is horrible.
3699422	3701063	It was horrible.
3701123	3703724	It was bad, but if I was seven years old, I'd probably like it.
3705425	3707966	Anyway, if I was seven years old, I might enjoy Bubble Bobble.
3708550	3708910	No, I'm kidding.
3708950	3711191	Actually, you can love Bubble Bobble no matter what your age.
3711511	3713452	It is a very cute game, though, aimed at children.
3713753	3714513	But guess what, kids?
3714593	3723157	Don't buy your kids Bubble Bobble Revolution on the DS or they're going to be pissed off because apparently this game was not playtested past level 30.
3724858	3733882	In other words, the game is supposed to have a boss show up at level 30 and the boss does not show up, therefore rendering the game unplayable.
3734963	3735443	Every time.
3737290	3738190	A quote from the source.
3765755	3767697	as soon as this has been determined.
3768117	3774662	Hey, folks over there at Taito making this game, how about you tell us a little bit about what you're going to do for your QA processes in the future?
3775102	3776043	Is it only the U.S.
3776183	3776263	one?
3777664	3778424	I'm not sure.
3778464	3780986	I think it's the only region this has been released in so far.
3781006	3785149	I thought that there was a Japanese... Maybe, but this is the only place where the problem's showing up.
3785169	3786090	Well, you know what?
3786130	3791854	Apparently they were too busy playing Rainbow Islands, which also, you know, was released at the same time.
3792961	3793782	instead of Bubble Bobble.
3793982	3799605	I mean, words cannot express what a fuck-up this is on Taito's part.
3799785	3804288	I mean, so nobody ever played through the whole game over in their testing.
3805068	3812013	You could use cheat codes to get through, I don't know, but somehow, some way, this really, really big flaw was overlooked.
3813013	3813954	I don't know.
3814094	3815435	Boss, forgot the boss.
3815755	3822519	It will make me hesitate every time I go to buy a Taito game on the DS from this point forward until they say what they're going to do to make it better.
3823632	3827873	I guess, but then again, you know, perhaps they've learned their lesson, so to speak.
3828694	3830755	So, I don't know.
3830855	3831195	Who knows?
3831255	3835156	Maybe their QA will get a lot better real fast after this very embarrassing screw-up.
3835956	3837497	But not good, folks.
3837637	3837977	Not good.
3838017	3839117	Someone's getting fired over this.
3840258	3842719	Yeah, DMN says in our chatroom, someone's getting fucking fired.
3843739	3844859	Ranma brings a good point.
3844919	3846100	Squeenix owns Taito now.
3846880	3847180	Oh, great.
3847200	3849261	Maybe Final Fantasy XII will be unplayable.
3851542	3852102	I doubt that, though.
3854926	3862651	There's lots of things to doubt though, whenever anything that's involving them is coming about.
3862731	3864232	But never mind, I'm not going to be bitter.
3864672	3865432	Not going to be bitter.
3867053	3874958	Anyway, speaking of releases and things, we have some stuff from THQ for launch week for the Wii.
3875138	3876159	Four games.
3878020	3881202	The first, of course, this is the big one, is Cars.
3881940	3883821	Spongebob Squarepants Creature from the Krusty Krab
3910953	3914478	I don't remember the Barnyard title, but then again, I wouldn't have remembered that.
3914498	3915058	It's been there.
3917201	3921467	It's just so exciting because these are all GameCube ports of previous months.
3922100	3924201	She could have said three games are coming out for the Wii.
3924281	3925121	Whoop, D and shit.
3925142	3926822	And it would have had the exact same impact for me.
3926862	3927603	I'm just sorry.
3927783	3928883	Not interested in any of these titles.
3929023	3929924	You know what's really sad?
3929944	3931064	I guess Cars might be cute.
3931104	3933525	Some of these games I thought were new are not new.
3933585	3940269	Like, for example, GT from Ubisoft is apparently a port of GT for the GameCube that came out a long time ago.
3940769	3942930	And same with Monster 4x4 World Circuit.
3943030	3946411	It's a port of an Xbox game that came out a while ago, too.
3946752	3949173	Or I think it may have been a GameCube game at one time, too.
3949193	3951694	But I know the Xbox version came out in April.
3952561	3971776	and so they're nothing new it's just a lot of ports and I actually cancelled my pre-order for GT because of that so I'm like I'm not gonna buy no fucking port no matter how cool that little steering wheel might be you can buy the steering wheel if you really want it they are selling it separately which apparently has no online play that's very disappointing what?
3971917	3972117	what?
3972377	3972497	what?
3972517	3972637	what?
3972757	3972917	what?
3972957	3973198	what?
3973238	3973458	what?
3973598	3973698	what?
3977113	3977313	Rob!
3977353	3977413	Rob!
3977453	3977513	Rob!
4002170	4004310	Some things that are not so crappy, though.
4004631	4005911	And quite fun, actually.
4006371	4012252	Mario Kart... Or Mario Kart GP 2 is coming to an arcade.
4012272	4013012	That's the arcade one, right?
4013052	4013452	Yeah.
4013492	4013793	Hot!
4014253	4016353	Yeah, that's the game that I played when I was drunk.
4017393	4018354	On my bachelor party.
4018374	4019554	Why isn't that video on YouTube?
4020714	4022274	Uh, because I haven't loaded it on there yet.
4022514	4023315	We're gonna make that happen.
4023615	4029376	But, um, basically, you know, the game itself looks very similar to, um...
4031232	4036215	Very similar to what we've seen before, although I do see some things, though, that look new.
4036315	4045181	Like, uh, some of the characters... I don't know who this is, and I don't know if you would know, Rob, uh, but this character looks very, very familiar.
4045681	4046322	Let's see here.
4046862	4050725	I think that... No, this is from, um, uh, Tamagotchi or whatever, I think.
4052065	4052886	That character right there.
4053046	4054507	Yeah, that looks like a Tamagotchi.
4054527	4055468	Tamagotchi, uh, Corner Shop.
4055548	4060551	So that's gonna be one of the brand new characters, uh, Tamagotchi character, and then it looks like, um...
4061084	4075597	You know, you got all your repeat characters, you know, Wario, Mario, Luigi, Waluigi, Yoshi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and then the ghosts, and Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man.
4076478	4078100	So, very interesting.
4078140	4084946	They have, of course, a lot more stuff that you can put on your character, or your screen caps, you know how they do the webcam thing.
4085442	4086103	and more accessories.
4104887	4105327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4121852	4122373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4142992	4146856	No word on the banker or a very scary looking Howie Mandel coming into play here.
4147176	4157766	But supposedly 25,000 Wiis are being given away as well as a $1 million prize and a trip to Los Angeles to go actually see the show live in person and be frightened by Howie Mandel in person.
4160408	4162030	Good luck to any of our listeners that enter this.
4162490	4168996	I forgot to mention, since we don't have the video of my playing Mario Kart GP drunk on YouTube,
4169315	4174438	You can, however, download it for your PSP on olrpsp.com under the download section.
4174578	4178480	I assure the listeners it will be on YouTube by the time you hear this show.
4180241	4181762	Look for username Orange Lounge Radio.
4183724	4190528	Well, speaking of other amusing things, guess what Microsoft is going to be doing?
4192749	4196251	Charging me more microtransactions for luminous backgrounds.
4196900	4197660	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4225854	4234557	So there's not anything they can really say on it right now, of course, but it's still very, very early on.
4237197	4238478	So they're thinking ahead.
4238558	4239658	This isn't a surprise.
4239718	4242659	I mean, Xbox 360 was being worked on years in advance.
4243139	4247180	Just because they're laying down the preliminary groundwork does not mean the 360 is dead by any means.
4247200	4248721	These things take years to happen.
4248781	4252622	I think it's getting blown out of proportion a little bit by some of the gaming media out there.
4254052	4255132	Guess what, folks?
4255413	4262958	Sony is probably working on a PlayStation 4, and Nintendo is doing a Wii again, or whatever they're going to call it.
4262978	4265800	I mean, more Wii.
4266121	4267582	Who remembers the Neptune?
4269903	4272545	How long did that take to eventually become the Dreamcast?
4273626	4275588	Oh, the Dolphin, huh?
4276028	4276568	Yeah, I gotcha.
4278590	4279290	Yeah, hopefully, though...
4280807	4284408	Maybe they'll pick a cool development name and stick to it.
4284468	4288330	Remember how disappointed people were when Nintendo dropped that name Revolution and went with Wii?
4288730	4290430	I think people are used to it now.
4290450	4294112	I think people got the sand out of their vagina now over that whole naming of the Wii.
4294272	4294832	I told you.
4294892	4295672	Revolution was a cool name.
4295952	4296733	Wasn't I right?
4296873	4300274	Simplicity, easy to remember, something people will talk about.
4300314	4301954	We'll see when the damn thing goes on sale.
4301994	4306136	Besides, they need to save Revolution in case they come up with something really, really cool like...
4306996	4308917	3D holographic projection or something like that.
4309197	4309858	They tried that.
4309938	4311799	It was a game called Time Stalker.
4311839	4315721	Which was the big reveal on this show that Nintendo was supposedly putting in the Wii console.
4316602	4317582	Yeah, but you know what?
4317802	4324446	Somebody is still working on it apparently because that was still a quote that one of the game companies out there had the technology to do it.
4324546	4331610	So, you know, unless PlayStation 3 is doing that, which I don't think so, but you know, whatever.
4331790	4333011	I guess that would justify the cost.
4336445	4344911	Alright, well, when I said something about Microsoft charging on Xbox Live for little bits and pieces here and there, I wasn't joking, folks.
4345352	4348414	Now, to be fair, it's not really Microsoft that sets up these fees.
4348474	4349435	It is the developers.
4350135	4351376	Well, wait until you hear this one.
4351806	4358428	Electronic Arts is selling Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007 cheats on Xbox Live.
4358768	4364350	In other words, you can just download for 200 points, unlock golfer, and unlock courses.
4364390	4365190	That's 200 each.
4365550	4368791	And you will open up all the hidden golfers and courses in the game.
4369251	4371972	Don't even have to think about, oh, I've got to play through and do this.
4372292	4374573	I've got to play through and do that to unlock it.
4375183	4378707	So you can still play through the game the old-fashioned way and not have to pay the points.
4379008	4384174	But if you just want to unlock everything right at the start, just like that, pay 200 points for a simple unlock key.
4384474	4385475	Good idea, bad idea?
4386917	4387978	Bad idea.
4388419	4388639	Why?
4390081	4391483	Because it takes...
4393175	4401101	Why hands... Actually, it's more of a reflection on the society, so I don't want to say necessarily a bad idea, just a sad idea.
4401801	4408366	That people are so wanting the instant gratification, wanting it now, that they can't freaking work for something.
4409726	4410727	That pisses me off.
4411328	4414530	But Jamie, I have to have this course.
4414610	4417392	My friends are coming over tonight for a Tiger Woods tournament.
4417832	4419613	I have to play this course.
4419693	4421955	I suggest you start playing the hell out of it now.
4423348	4426732	Sit your ass down in that chair and play your goddamn golf.
4428795	4429495	Loki, any thoughts?
4429535	4429856	Good idea?
4429896	4430256	Bad idea?
4430276	4431598	I think it's dumb.
4431938	4441029	Just because, I mean, I guess what they're trying to make sure that when the next Tiger Woods game comes out, which is just going to have more courses anyways and probably not be very different,
4441465	4442566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4462828	4490093	Xbox Live Marketplace stuff that should have probably been included in the game like how to throw a pass yeah that might be useful when I play the game Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says breaking news they're going to add drivable golf carts in Tiger Woods 2008 and you'll have to pay for the steering wheel so that you'll be able to drive the golf cart I would love to drive golf carts in Tiger Woods and run over people that would sell the game for me alright well
4491368	4496413	That's just about it for the gaming news tonight, but it's not it for everything we've got to say.
4496453	4504900	Because, you know, DarkSakura, she has to surf the web up and down and left and right every single week and find a site for your viewing pleasure.
4505420	4508123	And it's featured here in the website of the week.
4508263	4511426	DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers right now?
4514895	4541271	I would suggest the site of false advertising a gallery of parody it's at parody.organique.com that's p-a-r-o-d-y dot a sorry o-r-g-a-n-i-q-u-e dot com and it's got lots of neat little um false ads basically you just scroll through the site and uh it's basically like one of them is star sucks coffee drink our coffee or we'll break your legs
4542370	4544711	and Radio Shit, You've Got Money, We've Got Pockets.
4546572	4549273	So for those folks that like funny ha-ha parody ads.
4549633	4551694	My favorite one on here is the fourth one in.
4552434	4553795	It's an ad for Prozac.
4554155	4555656	It says, you'd kill them without it.
4555876	4556876	It shows a picture of a family.
4557076	4562118	Do they have a parody ad of the whole, you remember it was controversial about two months ago, they had the white PSP ads?
4562899	4563859	Do we have any parodies of that?
4564419	4566180	No, I haven't seen any so far.
4566200	4569081	I've seen Calvin Clone, Dare to Be the Same.
4569541	4570562	Get working on that, folks.
4571616	4572737	and BabyGasp.
4572877	4574038	Next week I'll outgrow this.
4575178	4576159	It's pretty funny.
4577079	4577980	Check it out, boys and girls.
4579100	4580401	DarkSakura's website of the week.
4581802	4587906	One other thing we've been featuring here pretty weekly here on Orange Lounge Radio are DDR previews.
4588266	4593669	We've been previewing new tracks of DDR games upcoming on the Xbox and Xbox 360 systems.
4594309	4595170	And guys, you know what?
4595310	4597251	Next week is the last week for this.
4597771	4598692	Cry, sob.
4598712	4599212	Well, that's right.
4599232	4600273	The games will be out soon enough.
4600819	4603520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4624915	4628056	Well, then I obviously don't know what I'm talking about, so let's get to the music.
4628096	4632357	We have two new tracks tonight from DDR Ultramix 4 and two new tracks from DDR Universe.
4632777	4635178	Let's start it off with a track from DDR Ultramix 4.
4635258	4637359	No long versions tonight, folks, sorry to say.
4637759	4639099	Just have some short tracks for you guys.
4639119	4641200	This first song is from DDR Ultramix 4.
4641600	4645901	It's by a group called Neuroactive, and the song is called More Serotonin.
4646301	4647922	Enjoy it here on the Sneak Peeks.
4648302	4650122	Neuroactive
4654185	4655065	Thanks for watching!
4739089	4744673	That was NeuroActive with more serotonin here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.
4745180	4749225	I caught myself doing the little head bob thing, Night at a Roxbury, during that song.
4751007	4753070	You know, for a dancey trancy song, not bad.
4753330	4753751	I like that.
4754485	4757527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4779743	4781705	You guys see if maybe it's more your thing?
4782185	4789450	It's by Wave Group featuring Scotty D. They did that Stompin' at the Gotham song last week, which was awesome, that jazzy one we all liked.
4789490	4791151	So see if you like this one.
4791171	4794233	It's called Bongo here on the Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeps.
4794253	4794754	Bongo.
4796575	4796975	Hear that?
4797776	4804561	It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.
4805861	4807943	It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.
4844189	4845335	Everybody's trying to do it.
4894429	4901714	Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks, that is Bongo by Wave Group featuring Scotty D, coming soon to DDR Universe.
4902174	4903355	See, what I was telling you, it's a little different.
4903555	4905036	Now, that song's growing on me.
4905216	4910139	I like the whole, like, kind of like Austin Powers, 60s spy theme vibe that song has going.
4910479	4916143	I think, with all due respect to the folks that wrote that and sang it, I think it's the voiceovers that kind of bug me a little bit in that.
4916163	4918445	I don't know, it's just, it's a little weird and out of place to me.
4918525	4921887	But, eh, it'll probably be, you know, songs sound different.
4922427	4928632	When you're just listening to them than when you do when you're actually playing them and dancing to them when they're coming out of your TV, so I'm sure I won't even notice.
4929264	4933668	Alright, let's go to a song from DDR Ultramix 4, and this one's pretty exciting.
4933708	4942737	This is by a group called Real Life, and you might remember years ago in the 80s, they did that song Semi and Angel, and they still play it in clubs around the nation, right?
4943077	4951285	So they have a song in DDR Ultramix 4, it's called Oblivion, and it was remixed by Neveraka, who did some of the other remixes in previous Ultramix games.
4951525	4954028	I didn't realize that they sung the original of that.
4954368	4954508	Hmm.
4955738	4958520	I have the Never Rock I mix, I just need to listen to the original.
4958620	4958960	There it is.
4959020	4962482	It's Real Life with Oblivion here on Orange Launch Radio.
4962542	4962942	Sneak Peeks.
4965224	4976770	Oblivion Bring it on Oblivion Bring it on
5024987	5033580	And the world turns round Yeah, life goes on And the world turns round
5077932	5079913	DDR Sneak Peeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5079933	5082254	That was Oblivion by Real Life.
5082694	5083595	The Never Rock-A-Mix.
5084075	5086116	Alright, one more song for you guys tonight.
5086176	5088557	And this song is coming to DDR Universe.
5089117	5091478	And it's a song by Chris Fortier.
5091598	5093159	Or actually, it could be Fortier.
5093179	5093579	I'm not sure.
5093619	5094339	I think it's Fortier.
5095040	5097021	It's a song called What Have Her.
5097101	5099662	And it's going to be on DDR Universe.
5099762	5100102	Enjoy.
5191420	5195143	What have her here on Orange Lounge Radio coming soon to DDR Universe.
5195444	5197185	Something I really like about the beats of that song.
5197225	5199207	It's kind of got a very driving beat behind it.
5199247	5199967	So that's pretty cool.
5200128	5200648	That's a fun one.
5201614	5202915	We'll be playing that very soon.
5203675	5205557	Another thing we're going to be playing here are your calls.
5205617	5209819	If you want to call in and talk to us here on Orange Lounge Radio, our Skype line is now open.
5209859	5212481	It's 916-226-9067.
5212801	5214422	Please keep in mind that is a toll call.
5214502	5217303	Yes, there is an 800 number coming very, very, very, very, very soon.
5217624	5218384	We'll have that very soon.
5219105	5220705	Or you can Skype us.
5220765	5224808	Of course, you have to be listening Wednesday in order to do this, so I'm not even sure why I'm saying this.
5225248	5230011	So we'll just see if any of our hardcore listeners are trying to get through, and I see we have some already starting to come in.
5230489	5231430	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5231450	5231810	Who's this?
5232350	5233090	Raven's Dolphin.
5233491	5234051	Hello, my friend.
5234071	5234551	What's on your mind?
5235552	5236092	Not much.
5236452	5237533	Yeah, there is a lot much.
5238093	5241615	I got Mario vs. Donkey Kong, March of the Minis.
5241715	5243476	I've seen this game advertised on TV quite a bit.
5243496	5245677	What did you think of it?
5246217	5247638	I hated the first one.
5247878	5254002	The first one was like holding your hand like a little mommy going, okay, this is how you jump this and this is how this.
5254322	5258384	This one just throws you in and just goes like, okay, fuck everything up.
5259537	5261739	I owned the first one and it was okay.
5261799	5264681	I didn't really play through the whole thing and beat it, but it was okay.
5265602	5266703	I did the illegal thing.
5266783	5267844	I did the Loki thing.
5268465	5269165	Shame!
5271187	5271527	Yeah.
5271728	5272949	Shame, shame, shame.
5272989	5277273	Alright, well, but you went out and got the second one, so I guess you've redeemed yourself a little bit.
5277633	5278694	So, it's okay?
5278714	5278794	Yeah.
5280316	5280777	It's good.
5280917	5281517	I love it.
5281937	5283678	I think it doesn't hold your hand.
5283718	5284799	That's what I love about it.
5285319	5287380	And the mini Marios are great.
5287801	5289021	They move when you move.
5289422	5291343	So when you tap the screen, they stop.
5291583	5293264	If you want them to move, they move.
5293904	5297606	And if you want them to go up, you stroke the stylus up.
5299227	5299748	It's a great game.
5300068	5300388	All right.
5301469	5303890	So you would recommend this to folks who like puzzlers or...
5304699	5305560	I recommend it.
5305880	5308282	I recommend it a lot, but the game is short.
5309062	5314907	I only got it for a couple of hours, and I'm already through the fifth level.
5314927	5315607	I'm almost done.
5315807	5321532	Will it be enough to tear me away from the duality of Phantasy Star Universe and Final Fantasy XII on the horizon this month?
5321952	5322172	No.
5322472	5324053	Okay, yeah, then I figured as much.
5324954	5326075	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
5326816	5329337	Yeah, Phantasy Star Universe, that game.
5330598	5334021	Sunday, you said that when it closed, you can't get it back open.
5335666	5338987	Meaning when the marketplace demo goes down, it's down.
5339287	5339628	Period.
5340348	5341388	No, it wasn't for me.
5341648	5341848	Really?
5342028	5344429	I got it to download when you said that.
5344489	5345910	You were like, it's down.
5345950	5350772	I think they left it up a little longer than it was supposed to be, but it's down now for sure.
5351352	5356894	There's folks on some of the Phantasy Star Universe forums I lurk on that say they tried to go get it and it's gone.
5358328	5359709	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5388260	5388921	A black girl.
5389882	5393587	Did you do this tip from the previous listener that says create a hot woman?
5394468	5396771	No, I just felt like something different.
5397472	5401497	I just felt like creating a black girl, name her Misty, and just see what happens.
5401717	5403259	Have you been getting flirted with a lot in the game?
5404429	5410631	No, but I've been getting those weird pop-ups that go like, hey, great website, freeones.com, or craziness.
5411131	5412411	Oh, by the way, here's a tip.
5412511	5425015	If you guys don't know, on the Phantasy Star Universe, to get those little anime-looking faces to pop up, the trick is you type at, like the at symbol, like you use in an email address, followed by one of the numbers 1 through 12, and that's what makes those faces come up.
5426415	5427655	So just go try that out.
5428075	5431276	All right, Raven's off, and we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for your call.
5431656	5432017	Have a good one.
5432997	5433657	Let's go to another call.
5434161	5435301	Hi, you're on OLR.
5435341	5435742	Who's this?
5436642	5437702	This is DMN.
5437943	5439023	Oh, hello, DMN.
5439063	5439603	Oh, God.
5439743	5440323	How's your mom?
5441604	5442784	My mom's doing great.
5443025	5443785	Tell her we said hi.
5443805	5444365	What's on your mind?
5445506	5452628	Well, first of all, and I heard about the ads in the games also at work today, and I think that's complete and utter bullshit.
5453489	5453809	Uh-huh.
5453969	5455470	So why is this complete and utter bullshit?
5456050	5463833	I think EA is just getting more money hungry, and they think with games like Madden 07 and franchises like Battlefield...
5464278	5466379	that they can throw those ads in and make more money.
5467220	5469981	I don't think that they need to do that.
5470101	5473803	They can make the money just fine from selling those games.
5474464	5478126	I personally don't want ads in my games, period.
5479667	5482688	Was Battlefield 2142 something you were considering purchasing?
5483849	5487751	No, I'm not a fan of those games, but I'm very disappointed in EA for doing this.
5487791	5488752	You just don't like the trend?
5489452	5490293	I don't at all.
5490633	5490853	All right.
5491249	5492751	Loki, any response for this?
5493111	5494052	Or just nothing?
5494233	5496775	I don't really care about the ads in the game.
5496936	5498738	I mean, I don't know.
5499679	5501481	Well, you know, we put up with Myspace.
5501501	5503904	But then again, I haven't played the game yet, so, you know.
5504004	5504484	Well, we'll see.
5504524	5506186	Well, let us know when you actually get a chance to play the game.
5506707	5507648	Anything else on your mind, DMN?
5508849	5509851	Elite Beat Agents.
5510171	5510551	Yes.
5510591	5510772	Woo-hoo!
5512546	5515408	WAP to everybody complaining about the song list.
5515709	5517030	Go import Owen Don.
5517090	5521974	If it's bothering you that there's not enough Japanese songs in it, go import Owen Don.
5523435	5525837	I personally think the song list is fine.
5525857	5533364	Nintendo... This is the second major music title Nintendo's released, not counting the Donkey Kongus.
5533404	5535606	Yeah, I was going to say it's the third, isn't it?
5535646	5536707	Donkey Kong 1 and 2.
5537908	5538288	Technically.
5538608	5538849	Okay.
5539029	5539129	Um...
5540705	5541566	I like it.
5541826	5542586	It's a good game.
5543146	5561074	They're not catering to the hardcore music gamer, which is a bit disappointing, but Nintendo's in a business of making money, and if they can make more money by putting in Ashley Simpson and Avril Lavigne and artists people are familiar with, then they're going to make more money because people are going to be like, oh, I know these artists.
5561234	5562195	I like these songs.
5563257	5574300	Yeah, I agree that the music game fans do have to recognize Nintendo typically has to be geared at a younger audience, which is, you know, kind of who listens to Sk8er Boi and that Ashley Simpson chick.
5575400	5580901	And, you know, this can be an enabler, because if this game is a success, we'll see more music titles from Nintendo.
5581201	5581902	And Owen Don?
5582242	5588723	Pretty darn original, considering, you know, a lot of folks say that there's not a lot original they can do with music games.
5588803	5591364	Owen Don kind of proved that wrong in Elite Beat Agents now, so...
5592352	5593273	Yeah, you're absolutely right.
5593373	5596515	And while we're on the subject of music games, Konami can kiss my ass.
5597736	5598096	Why is that?
5598116	5599818	Why on the In The Groove thing?
5600859	5607744	Yeah, I'm upset with that because I know Konami is going to acquire them, dig them in the ground, and we're going to have DDR.
5608244	5610386	I liked In The Groove, I liked some of the concepts.
5610606	5619493	I'd like to see Konami, you know, maybe see money within The Groove, release a third In The Groove, maybe leave it at that.
5619983	5629109	because the hardcore players, the players who enjoy playing those incredibly difficult songs will be catered to and Konami will make more money.
5629149	5631090	Damn, man, we don't know for sure what Konami's going to do yet.
5631270	5640856	It's possible we could see, I personally doubt this, but it's possible you could see Ka show up in DDR in the future.
5641676	5644518	And that would be awesome because I appreciate the music and...
5645137	5649719	I know him on a personal level, and he's a good guy, and he works really hard on that stuff.
5649879	5653941	So I'd like to see him in a DDR mix, or I'd like to see Naoki in it in the groove.
5654522	5658063	Either way, I'd like to see Konami do something with this and not bury in the groove in the ground.
5658864	5663226	I do think in the groove may go away, but maybe you'll see elements of the game show up.
5663346	5663826	Who knows?
5665107	5667788	I do kind of personally feel that my gut just tells me it's gone.
5668328	5669249	Gone, gone, gone, gone.
5671730	5673290	Alright, well DMN, thanks for your opinion.
5673471	5674211	Have a good week, okay?
5674781	5675483	Alright, you too, man.
5675503	5676104	Alright, see ya.
5676625	5676866	Bye.
5677086	5677547	Bye-bye.
5678108	5679130	Let's go to another call.
5681716	5682898	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5682939	5683339	Who's this?
5684001	5684362	It's me.
5685237	5686758	It's me, who's me?
5687219	5688780	It's me, Mario.
5689100	5691282	It's me, VXJasonXV.
5691342	5692583	Hello, VXJasonXV.
5692603	5693623	You haven't called in in a while.
5693663	5694244	It's good to hear from you.
5694704	5695405	I have not.
5696265	5700508	I can really only listen live every other week, because every other week I am sleeping before working.
5700729	5704872	I was thinking maybe your feathers were really ruffled tonight about something to cause you to call in.
5705252	5706333	Well, that too, but I was thinking.
5706733	5709055	Well, then what has you wanting to lay an egg tonight?
5709855	5715576	I'm with everybody else that the in-game advertising is really dumb.
5716477	5722618	Now, if this was a Madden game, if this was any sports game, I would be completely different, in my opinion.
5723078	5725079	But this is bull.
5725279	5726559	I'm not understanding the difference.
5727559	5736061	Because how many... Have you watched the news for any shots overseas that we are currently invading?
5737872	5741314	Have I watched the nightly news to see footage from Iraq?
5742194	5744555	How many of those have product advertisements?
5746456	5751458	In a war zone, targeted advertising really doesn't make sense to me.
5752644	5781345	I can understand the whole sports thing too because a lot of arenas and stuff have advertising plastered everywhere all over the place and as I said in sports games it makes sense for a couple of reasons Devil's Advocate, Battlefield 2142 takes place in the future, who's to say in these battle mech arenas they don't have advertising and I'm sure that they're still selling the 2007 Scion or whatever in 2142 and the Cheaps and Dodges collector's edition
5783534	5784154	Uh, no.
5784654	5789716	I mean, for sports games, I understand it, and I would have a different opinion for a couple of reasons.
5790437	5794318	One, sports games do not have dedicated player-run servers.
5794678	5797160	Unless I miss something with Battlefield, that's not the case.
5797340	5800541	Just like Counter-Strike and everything else, you should be able to run your own server.
5800881	5801341	Am I wrong?
5802782	5803142	I don't know.
5803702	5804543	Yeah, I don't know either.
5804603	5804963	Sorry, buddy.
5805475	5809559	Well, first-person shooters generally aren't locked into a specific service for a PC game.
5810020	5818028	So, second, just as Loki said, there are advertisements in stadiums, in arenas, in venues.
5818989	5825096	I don't walk outside and see a billboard unless I'm driving and I'm in the middle of the interstate.
5827200	5830462	Can you click on these ads in Battlefield and in the sports games?
5831022	5831122	No.
5831323	5832543	No, they're just digital things.
5832563	5834624	Shoot them and it'll launch up a browser.
5834685	5838046	Look, it's a valid question to ask, because in Anarchy Online it's different, right?
5838086	5838947	You can do that, right?
5839147	5840948	It's just, they're just there.
5841168	5842069	It's just like a picture.
5842289	5842869	Okay, never mind.
5843370	5844590	Never mind where my thought was going.
5844850	5846872	I was going to make this comparison to MySpace, but forget it.
5847512	5848092	I'm not going to bother.
5848953	5852635	On the same hand, I also disagree with the method they're going about doing it.
5853796	5856117	Just based off the fact that it's targeted...
5856693	5857693	doesn't sound right.
5857794	5862256	I mean, I would understand communicating with an ad server, but not by taking personal details.
5862696	5864377	This whole, it's anonymous bullshit, no.
5864797	5865737	No, not going to happen.
5866978	5877743	I wouldn't mind, again, I would not mind ads in modern day sports gaming or applicable gaming, but where they're doing it and how they're doing it for Battlefield?
5877943	5879283	Jason, are you on Xbox Live?
5881224	5882125	On old Xbox.
5882305	5884986	How do you feel about them using your IP address to give you advertising?
5886226	5887646	Where do they advertise this to me in Xbox?
5887666	5889647	Maybe not on old Xbox, but on new Xbox.
5889767	5891588	You see those banner ads all the time.
5891648	5893408	Download the new... Well, like I said, I don't have a 360.
5894088	5897549	Well, but still, Microsoft is Microsoft, and, you know, live is live.
5898089	5902291	You don't think it's showing what game... I mean, okay, I can log in at any time, Jason.
5902351	5903071	Perfect example.
5903111	5910093	You know why they have to supplement their income with... Okay, and this is kind of a stupid excuse, but you know why they have to supplement their income with advertising and stuff?
5910293	5911693	Because people pirate games.
5912573	5914414	Oh, boo-hoo, that's a crock of bullshit.
5914758	5918039	People turn profit all the time, even with piracy.
5918399	5920200	Don't you even bring out that.
5921180	5923921	Billions of dollars lost in the entertainment industry.
5923981	5925622	You of all people should talk, Loki.
5926142	5931784	Hey, that's why I thought it was ironic, seeing as I just had an arcade game running on my laptop.
5932764	5934264	Jason, I wouldn't brag about that.
5934324	5936325	Jason, anything else you want to share with us?
5939521	5944803	A lot of people have said that lately.
5944923	5946484	I think that's because I've actually been talking again.
5946644	5948865	You should be a late night DJ on our station, Jason.
5949485	5952987	Coming up next, music from In The Groove, if you know what I mean.
5954107	5955608	Alright, have a good one, Jason.
5955848	5956068	See ya.
5957209	5959630	Bringing it down and dirty like the litigation.
5959770	5960510	One more call.
5960590	5962411	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
5962431	5962991	Who the hell is this?
5964093	5965675	Hi there, everybody.
5965975	5966756	It's Ranma.
5966896	5967416	Hi, Ranma.
5967436	5968077	What's on your mind, buddy?
5968137	5968797	Hi, Rantan.
5970519	5971520	Hi, Jamie.
5973282	5977385	I listened to the first part of the podcast, and I have to bitch.
5979087	5984412	This whole profession of video gamer, can I find this guy and beat living daylights out of him?
5984472	5988876	Oh, you're talking about last week's show with the guy who dropped out of high school to go play video games for a living?
5989622	5990463	Yes, I know, I know.
6007420	6013303	I don't understand why he would just drop out of school and become a professional video gamer.
6013703	6022426	If I told my mother that she would knock me into next week, hell, I think any kid that tells their parent that their parent is looking like they're crazy and take the console away from them.
6022867	6023347	You know what?
6023627	6024467	It's not going to happen.
6025087	6025868	Do you see where that might be?
6025888	6027448	Again, to play devil's advocate.
6028029	6029369	I'm somewhat in agreement with you.
6029409	6032871	I'm not quite as violent as you on the issue, but I'm in agreement that he should have finished school.
6032931	6033411	No, it's fine.
6033751	6034771	Everybody's welcome to their opinion.
6035232	6035452	But...
6038005	6040211	If you're a high school kid and you're that age.
6041016	6043197	and you think you know everything, but you really don't.
6043317	6049661	And anyone who's over the age of 21 will tell somebody who's under the age of 18, wait until college, wait until your 20s.
6049881	6051883	And when we say that, we mean it, folks.
6051963	6054904	I know we have a lot of teens listening to the program.
6055144	6057726	We're not trying to do that to sound mean or elitist or anything.
6058166	6060828	You really will learn so much more when you go to college.
6060868	6061408	It's unreal.
6061728	6064510	You learn about drugs.
6064530	6065631	The birds and the bees.
6066151	6067652	Look, I just...
6068032	6071255	Trust me, my 20s were an eye-opening experience in so many ways.
6071275	6086731	But anyway, where I was going with this, when you're 16 and you think you know everything but you don't, and somebody's going to offer you $10,000 or stay in high school and have to go to those teachers that hate me, my teachers hate me, right?
6087011	6087532	What are you going to do?
6087552	6087852	Right.
6088993	6094296	See, I take the $10,000 and I'll at least try to use it towards my education.
6094416	6096477	See, that's something I learned, you know.
6096757	6100419	Maybe to him, he had the starry eyes, he's going to do something.
6100699	6107303	I give him props for doing something that we probably wanted to be, the ultimate video gamer, as he claims that he is.
6107883	6115787	But the thing is, what is he going to do when he loses, and loses, and loses, and then no one's going to really care about this guy?
6116287	6117548	What's he going to do then, you know?
6117841	6118041	Exactly.
6118061	6118721	Wear your sky hat Saturday.
6118741	6119702	Okay.
6119722	6119922	Bye.
6148387	6149088	They're not getting it.
6149628	6150869	So, no Gears of War for you.
6152250	6153391	Because it'd be banned.
6153652	6155013	It's too violent.
6156394	6156674	You know.
6156834	6157455	For Germany?
6157755	6161398	Well, yeah, they were, they, well, I guess, they seem like they have a laid-back country.
6161438	6162139	Dead Rising, remember?
6162159	6163300	Dead Rising didn't come out there.
6163320	6164321	Alright, alright, alright.
6164381	6166463	I know, I didn't get it either, but, you know, whatever.
6167103	6169065	You know, poop porn, okay.
6169565	6170666	Gears of War, not okay.
6171247	6171627	Don't get it.
6172128	6174709	I'd be curious to hear from a German listener what the culture's like there.
6174890	6175470	Send us an email.
6175570	6178312	Mailbag at orangemonstrider.com Yeah, I have no idea.
6179012	6182094	I make up stuff off the top of my head as far as culture goes.
6182694	6186196	Anyways, this isn't really gaming.
6186216	6193980	I think sometimes he forgets that we record this and people actually listen to it and form opinions on us based on what they hear.
6194381	6197362	I want somebody in Germany to kidnap me and treat me to beer.
6197943	6201885	This is exciting and I know we didn't talk about it on the show.
6202452	6202972	Konami.
6203272	6205553	You might remember the Gradius Collection, right?
6206974	6215258	Well, apparently that did okay because we're going to see a Salamander Collection, Twinbee Collection, and Parodius Collection.
6215378	6216639	Are these all separate games?
6216779	6217739	These are all separate games.
6218540	6219720	You said the P word.
6220300	6220621	Yes.
6220861	6221461	Parodius.
6222168	6224730	Maybe Sexy Proteus will be unlockable.
6226191	6229132	I love chatting Proteus.
6229172	6238918	The Salamander collection will include Salamander, Life Force, Salamander 2, and I have no idea how to pronounce this, but X-E-X-E-X, whatever that is.
6239439	6239899	Sexies.
6239999	6240619	I've seen that before.
6240639	6241140	And a secret game.
6246864	6258887	Parodius Collection will include Parodius Da, Gokoju Parodius, Sexy Parodius, Jinkyu, Oshaburi Parodius, and another secret title.
6259267	6266830	And finally, Twinbee Collection includes Twinbee, Deltanaw Twinbee, Twinbee Yahoo, and Poppin' Twinbee.
6267010	6268350	And those are all PSP.
6268990	6270911	Yahoo is like, Yahoo.
6271491	6272351	And those are all PSP?
6272591	6273231	All PSP.
6273651	6273892	Wow.
6273972	6275472	So that's pretty sweet.
6277184	6279547	I'm never going to let the PSP out of my sight.
6280047	6285233	Wow, I have to say Life Force and the whole Salamander series is my favorite shooter.
6285593	6286714	That was one of my favorite ones.
6286814	6290238	Next to Guardian Legend, which I've given up hope on Guardian Legend.
6291940	6297926	Then EA announced a new Def Jam game, Def Jam Icon, and
6298527	6299328	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6313860	6316562	But music comes into play in a very big part.
6317142	6320925	As in, you're fighting and the whole environment reacts to the music.
6321305	6328009	You see cars bouncing and the buildings... Eventually, as you're throwing more combos and stuff, buildings start crushing down and stuff like that.
6328490	6331732	And actually, the bass and stuff plays into your attacks.
6331792	6334934	And you can actually throw people on the walls and stuff like that.
6335414	6336315	That sounds pretty cool.
6336595	6338376	I have to give him props.
6338456	6342559	As much as I hated that one Def Jam game I played, Fight for New York or whatever it was,
6342932	6343652	That sounds kind of neat.
6343672	6344212	It looks pretty.
6344572	6345033	Wow.
6345093	6346353	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
6346413	6351594	So, I mean, I'm kind of, you know, I'm kind of interested in that because, you know, that might be worth checking out.
6352154	6356175	But, anyways, and then... I bet JT will have a field day with this one.
6357196	6358416	Oh, I'm sure, whatever.
6358836	6361897	Anyways, there's some other cool stuff.
6361997	6366598	Well, this isn't really game related, but for some reason Joystick ran this story.
6367257	6371178	There's a school, I guess, that banned tag and other chasing games for recess.
6371478	6372879	I don't know what the hell that has to do with anything.
6372899	6373459	That's retarded.
6373879	6376440	Yeah, it's just where society's going.
6376560	6378261	I think it's a reflection on that.
6378641	6380701	Yeah, so that's kind of interesting.
6382342	6384243	And then some interesting stuff.
6384263	6387584	Of course, we knew Far Cry, the movie, being directed by Uwe Boll.
6388424	6389564	That's interesting, I guess.
6389744	6391345	So I will not be seeing Far Cry, the movie.

6398364	6398704	Hot.
6398845	6402968	I actually like Mutant Storm Reloaded, even if it does have crappy loading times.
6402988	6404829	They fixed that, though.
6404909	6406130	I know, I heard.
6406170	6406270	Yeah.
6419392	6435878	and it looks pretty and small arms and several others that they haven't revealed yet so hopefully castle crashers which I heard someone reported that some woman thinks that's racist I saw that on Destructoid hilarious video go check it out so anyways
