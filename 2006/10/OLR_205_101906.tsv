0	21480	Tonight, October 22nd, 2006, new firmware is on deck to the PSP, a Nintendo DS game
21480	29760	releases with a major bug still in the game, and is EA watching your every move?
29760	36760	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that
36760	41840	video game podcast dedicated to gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, and what you, the
41840	47280	gamer, really want to know. Welcome to our show. We're pre-taping this week. We're a
47280	51760	little early. It is Wednesday night, October 18th, but this will be our week
51760	56600	show. That's because I'm traveling this week, and so is one of our lovely co-hosts
56600	61440	here, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Are you saying that Loki is lovely? I suppose. In
61440	66040	his own manly way. And I'm moving. Yeah, that's right, you're moving this weekend.
66040	70140	So everybody's busy this weekend, so it's just a bad weekend for us. I'm going to see
70140	77320	see, uh, boy love. Oh, YowieCon? Going to YowieCon, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.
77320	81600	And? Gonna see Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D! But see, by the time most people
81600	84640	hear this, that will have all already happened, because this this is still
84640	86720	going to air usually on Sundays.
86720	90040	We do have a small audience in our chat, a lot of our loyal listeners tonight here on
90040	91040	Wednesday night.
91040	95440	I just wanted to kind of lay that down up front just in case there was some developing
95440	98260	news, some of these stories changed throughout the week.
98260	103000	Keep your time frame in mind that we're doing this on Wednesday, so don't blame us if something
103000	104000	changed.
104000	106240	Don't blame us collectively, but you can blame Rob personally.
106240	107240	Sure, why not?
107240	108880	All right, so anyway, let's start it off.
108880	111360	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
111360	114040	I had a gaming week.
114040	118080	My gaming week consisted of me being half asleep watching Dan play that crappy Mortal
118080	123640	Kombat game, going, oh my God, I hate the sound effects of this game, go to sleep.
123640	125200	That's what we talked about last week.
125200	128760	I know, but that wasn't, since my gaming week has been three days.
128760	134040	No, no, I know, but I'm curious, I thought it was okay, why did you think it was crappy?
134040	136720	I hate the music in it and I hate the sound effects.
136720	139720	And just watching him do the same crap over and over.
139720	155760	If I want to play a good beat-em-up, I could do that Tekken fighting mode from Tekken 3.
155760	161680	I actually haven't played Phantasy Star Universe yet, either, because I've been doing real
161680	162680	life things.
162680	163680	Well, you're in luck.
163680	166520	I heard the beta was extended, which, again, we'll do the Sunday listeners no good because
166520	169800	it's extended through Saturday, but that's what I'm hearing.
169800	170800	It doesn't mean no good.
170800	171800	Well, unless I want to play tonight.
171800	173800	I think you can play some tonight.
173800	174800	Yeah.
174800	176840	I'm actually gaming gaming tomorrow.
176840	177840	Like old-school D&D.
177840	178840	Like, no.
178840	179840	Roll D20.
179840	180840	Werewolf.
180840	181840	Oh, God, you nerd.
181840	182840	I game every other week.
182840	189800	Yes, everybody, not only am I a video gaming girl, I do tabletop gaming, too.
189800	194080	Which just, you know, further cement you as a hardcore nerd.
194080	199080	I know what a D4 is used for in second edition D&D, bitches.
199080	200080	Nerd patrol.
200080	201080	Nerd patrol.
201080	202080	You can use it for a whip.
202080	203080	Nerd herd.
203080	204080	Nerd herd.
204080	205080	Loki, how you doing?
205080	206080	How was your gaming week?
206080	208080	It was short, I guess.
208080	211640	Well, I played Grand Theft Auto.
211640	216600	I didn't get to play any of the PlayStation 2 games that I have lined up to play.
216600	221120	I don't get to play a lot of games right now because I'm packing, and packing sucks.
221120	226280	But I am looking forward to playing The Warriors, which, you know, is coming out on the PSV
226280	227280	pretty soon.
227280	228800	Well, probably next year.
228800	233800	Yes, it was a movie, and it was an awesome PlayStation 2 game, too.
233800	237240	So yeah, lots of Grand Theft Auto, and I'm kicking ass in that.
237240	239200	And Zuma a little bit.
239200	241360	I'm on level 9 now.
241360	246240	I beat level 8 while Nellie was asleep because she couldn't get past it, and she was getting
246240	247240	frustrated.
247240	250640	But she says, you know, she has to beat it herself before or else it doesn't count.
250640	251640	I don't know.
251640	253800	So whatever.
253800	258040	And then I played a little Dig Dug, and I was trying to play some Luminous Live, but
258040	261640	it won't download for me because it stops at 1%.
261640	266400	Xbox has been having some wacky stuff today ever since their maintenance yesterday.
266400	268160	And what did their maintenance do?
268160	270000	It's just stuff for their website, from what I hear.
270000	274140	Well, we don't really know the full scope of things yet, so possibly they've done some
274140	276080	type of upgrade that's dormant until later.
276080	277620	They broke Luminous Live.
277620	279960	That's what their update was for.
279960	280960	I don't know.
280960	283480	Oh, and of course Saints Row.
283480	286080	Been playing lots of Saints Row, and that's fun.
286080	291960	I'm trying for the million dollar achievement right now, and once I get that then I'll kind
291960	292960	of move on.
292960	297360	Yeah, that's pretty much it for now.
297360	298520	Some comments from our chat room.
298520	301680	We do have a small crowd there tonight, a little smaller than our usual Sunday show,
301680	305440	but we say thank you to the loyalists who are there as always.
305440	310640	Jeremy Todd 1 in response to Dark Soccer being a hardcore nerd says, Tabletop gaming is for
310640	313960	people who aren't hardcore enough to play video games.
313960	314960	I did both.
314960	317520	That means I'm double hardcore.
317520	321880	SSJ100 Matt says, Jesus saves and rolls D20s.
321880	322880	Get it?
322880	323880	That's a roleplaying joke.
323880	326080	Did Jesus make a saving throw?
326080	327720	Let's see, My Gaming Week.
327720	329860	I've been playing more of the Phantasy Star universe beta.
329860	334080	I will say this, those of you guys that got frustrated with connection issues and things
334080	338080	of that sort and getting started, may not have given the game enough opportunity because
338080	341920	I'll tell you what, when I got in a party with some of my real life friends and we were
341920	346040	able to do voice chat, the game got like 5,000 times better.
346040	348040	I'm looking forward to the commercial release.
348040	349760	I'm definitely going to pick up the commercial release.
349760	353240	I'm still going to hold off on a full review of the game until I actually have a commercial
353240	358400	release in my hands to review, but we will talk more about Phantasy Star universe at
358400	359960	a later date.
359960	362560	Meanwhile, I downloaded Luminous Life today.
362560	366280	I was able to grab it this morning, I guess maybe before the masses were getting home
366280	372240	from work, school, and started downloading on Luminous Life, so I picked that up.
372240	374840	I want to warn you about something with Luminous Life.
374840	379200	The game's got microtransactions at the butt, and when I say that, I mean when you download
379200	386120	the game, you can play Xbox Live, you can play normal challenge mode with about, I want
386120	390640	to say it's about 12 skins, forgive me if I'm a little off on that number, but if you
390640	394120	want to buy more skins, like you want to get a pack of 20 skins, you're going to have to
394120	397280	buy those later in what's called an advanced pack.
397280	402680	Also, if you go in to play versus CPU, you only get one skin, and once you play that
402680	408760	for about 10 levels, it says, thanks for trying this, buy the versus CPU pack if you want
408760	409920	more.
409920	413480	Then in mission mode, you get about five missions, hey, if you want more missions, buy the mission
413480	414480	pack.
414480	415480	Yeah, what the hell's the demo?
415480	417480	I mean, seriously, if this is the actual game, then what's the demo?
417480	420520	I guess it's one stage of the game, so pretty much the game you're getting on Xbox Live
420520	427320	is just the skeleton game of the non-stop puzzle mode with about 12 different skins,
427320	429200	and the ability to play on Xbox Live.
429200	436880	Oh goody, but I guess they'll have 700 songs on Xbox Live at some point for a micro-transaction
436880	447080	of $100 each, then maybe I'll get the, I can have this go with my Gran Turismo HD.
447080	452000	It's hard for me to sit here and be critical of Gran Turismo HD for the micro-transaction
452000	455360	things they've been talking about, and not apply the same logic to Luminous.
455360	457180	I don't think that would be okay for me to do.
457180	461620	As much as I love Luminous, and I think it's an awesome puzzle game, I don't think it's
461620	464880	fair for folks to be picking up Luminous when they don't really know what they're really
464880	465880	buying.
465880	469640	I don't think Q Entertainment and Microsoft have been very upfront about what exactly
469640	473840	you're getting with this, and the fact that some components of the game are missing.
473840	475440	Are you getting a full game?
475440	476440	Yes.
476440	478200	Are you getting the same thing as you got on the PSP?
478200	479200	No.
479200	483280	The PSP version as it stands right now offers more than the basic skeleton that Xbox Live
483280	485560	is giving you.
485560	488760	I don't feel like I can give this game a fair assessment until I know it's real price for
488760	489760	everything else.
489760	494280	Would it have been a little bit different if the game were like $5 instead of $15 out
494280	495280	the gate?
495280	499920	Maybe, but again, I would take all that into consideration with how much is each little
499920	501080	component price.
501080	505920	For example, Test Drive Unlimited was kind of using that formula, basically putting out
505920	511080	a very cheap game and then having microtransactions, but the difference between Test Drive Unlimited
511080	515960	and say Gran Turismo HD or Luminous is you don't need to purchase those.
515960	521400	Granted, I bought this game because, well, I'm a cheapen point horror and it sounded
521400	524480	pretty easy, so hey, what the hell?
524480	526440	So what if I play a few stages?
526440	529400	I don't like the fact that there is only five stages because I think there should be at
529400	535400	least more, and then say later on you want to buy more songs on top of a full game's
535400	537040	worth of songs.
537040	538040	That's fine.
538040	545000	Oh, by the way, you want to progress later on, you're going to have to buy the levels.
545000	550200	I can understand the logic that, hey, maybe not everyone wants to play Mission Mode.
550200	553200	Hey, maybe not everyone wants to play Puzzle Mode.
553200	557840	Okay, but still you have to take the value of what you're paying out in consideration
557840	563600	with all this is that for right now, for a pretty competitive $29.99, you can get the
563600	567440	PSP version of Luminous, which offers more skins.
567440	571120	As it stands right now, better songs, as far as I'm concerned, even though, yes, some of
571120	576440	the songs in Xbox Live's version are from Luminous 1, some of the best songs on Luminous
576440	582640	1 are nowhere to be seen so far in Xbox Live Luminous, and when you put those values side
582640	585280	by side, how worth it is it to be playing Luminous on your TV?
585280	586280	I don't know.
586280	587400	Or if you have a PlayStation 2.
587400	588400	Or on Xbox Live.
588400	592240	If you have a PlayStation 2, just wait and pick up Luminous Plus for $30 when that comes
592240	595360	out, which is basically just a rehash of Luminous.
595360	598760	By the way, the Madonna song, any licenses whatsoever, nowhere to be seen yet.
598760	601320	I don't know if they're going to be in the Advance pack.
601320	602800	Rumor has it they're not.
602800	609480	I have someone who's had a peek at the Advance pack and tells me that there's just more general
609480	613880	Q Entertainment produced songs in there from the first and probably second games.
613880	615840	Nice bait and switch there, Q Entertainment.
615840	620320	So I don't know where Madonna is or any licensed artists for that matter.
620320	621320	That could change.
621320	626640	I'm assuming that's on Rumor there, but I'm assuming that will be another buy later on
626640	629680	if you want to have Madonna or what have you in your game.
629680	630680	So, interesting.
630680	636240	Yeah, well, I remember reading, I know, and I've got to pull this up because I pulled
636240	640520	up a different article, same type of thing, but they were talking about other additional
640520	647400	downloads beyond the Advance pack, and I want to say it was run on 1UP, but I can't remember
647400	651320	what they were showing, oh, here we go.
651320	654120	I know they had a ton of micropayment stuff, and of course they were talking about the
654120	660600	Advance pack, but they were talking about other things that you can download as well.
660600	664160	Let's see here, it says, oh, they were just talking about, I guess, the mission and puzzle
664160	665160	mode.
665160	670240	They're assuming that each one's going to be about the same price, so like $6 each or
670240	676640	whatever, or 600 points each for another 12, 100 points, or $15.
676640	681440	It says that adds up to about $22.49, and it says all of a sudden the game, after you
681440	686840	bought everything, ends up costing you $37.49.
686840	687840	So I don't know.
687840	691720	I have a hard time being able to say I recommend Luminous Live or I don't because I feel like
691720	696280	the whole game has not yet been revealed, so it really depends.
696280	702200	Ask yourself this question before you buy it, A, if you don't own a PSP, I do think
702200	703200	it's worth it.
703200	708160	I don't think it's one of the greatest puzzlers ever made, even if the music is not as good
708160	709160	as the PSP version.
709160	713960	I wouldn't go tell you to buy a PSP just for Luminous, so I would say it's worth checking
713960	721120	out if you don't have a PSP, but if you do have a PSP, yeah, so.
721120	725680	Anyway, let's get into some housekeeping real quick for tonight.
725680	729120	Tonight's housekeeping, first off, it's only going to be a one-part show tonight because
729120	732840	of the fact that we are pre-taping and usually those only end up being one part.
732840	736400	I do want to point out we will still be doing DDR previews tonight, even though it is only
736400	742080	one part, and remember we're not live, so if you've joined our chat room on this lovely
742080	746000	Sunday evening or whenever you used to listen to us live, keep in mind that we are pre-taped
746000	747000	this week.
747000	753480	I also do have a message from one of our lesbians, Kristen would like everyone to know, she says
753480	754480	hi.
754480	756960	All right, so you're hanging out with her this weekend, right?
756960	757960	Yes, I am.
757960	759680	It's a whole cluster of people going to YowieCon.
759680	762760	We averted a crisis, but she did want me to tell all the listeners hi.
762760	763760	All right, sounds good.
763760	766880	All right, we're going to start to get into some gaming news tonight.
766880	767880	We've got one more thing.
767880	768880	Oh, yes.
768880	769880	Oh, did you get the Battlefield?
769880	770880	I'm so sorry.
770880	771880	The Battlefield contest.
771880	772880	Who won?
772880	773880	We do have a winner.
773880	777320	There was lots of entries, but there could only be one.
777320	778880	There could be only one.
778880	779880	Your mom.
779880	782680	Drum roll, please.
782680	787640	And the winner of the Battlefield 21-42, I don't remember which year it was.
787640	789120	Get the game name right, please.
789120	796080	The Battlefield 21-42 contest is Jason Tryon from St. Petersburg, Florida.
796080	797080	Congratulations.
797080	798080	Congratulations.
798080	804240	You'll be getting an email with your download code to download the full game with maybe
804240	808680	a few additional extras that we will be talking about a little bit later.
808680	809680	Yay.
809680	810680	Congratulations.
810680	813280	Wait, do I have my sound effect loaded here?
813280	814280	Hold on.
814280	816280	There we go.
816280	820320	Congratulations to you from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
820320	821800	We actually have breaking news tonight.
821800	825600	I'm going to interrupt our usual show role here because here at Orange Lounge Radio we
825600	826800	try to plan our stories in advance.
826800	832040	We literally got breaking news about 15 minutes before we went live tonight, and for long
832040	837160	time fans of Orange Lounge Radio who listened to us back in our music gaming days, we know
837160	838440	a lot of you folks are still with us.
838440	840240	This is huge news.
840240	845320	Directly from OrangeLoungeRadio.com, there's a press release today on Roxor's website and
845320	847360	it was short and simple.
847360	851600	Konami Corporation, developer of the Dance Dance Revolution video game, and Roxor Games
851600	856440	Inc., developer of the In the Groove dance games, today announced the mutual settlement
856440	860740	of the litigation between the parties in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District
860740	861960	of Texas.
861960	866100	Under the terms of the settlement, Konami has acquired the intellectual property rights
866100	868840	to the In the Groove dance game franchise.
868840	873480	It was further agreed as a part of the settlement that Roxor would respect Konami's intellectual
873480	875520	property rights.
875520	876520	Translation?
876520	877520	Pwned.
877520	882400	Yeah, so In the Groove dance game fans, not going to be too happy at this news.
882400	885920	I'm going to be honest, I'm hearing a lot of talk already about, oh, this opens the
885920	890840	door for Konami to make DDR versus In the Groove and all this other stuff.
890840	895200	Honestly guys, I think what Konami is going to do with this license, this newly acquired
895200	897840	license so to speak, absolutely nothing.
897840	902240	I think they've got their biggest competitor so to speak and they'll just crush it like
902240	903240	a grape.
903240	906960	It would be a DDR PC too.
906960	911920	Now granted, there may be more information forthcoming later, who knows?
911920	915760	Perhaps Konami will re-explore the PC market with the In the Groove franchise, who knows?
915760	919200	I mean, I'm not going to say for sure I'm the end-all, be-all, know-all of what's going
919200	923280	on but in my mind, that kind of makes the most sense for Konami.
923280	925680	Why dilute the market with more dance games, just make it all DDR?
925680	929760	Well, so they would put out that patch though for In the Groove if they didn't know that
929760	931600	they were going to be losing.
931600	935940	Exactly, and this is another good point that last week there was a patch release for the
935940	941320	arcade game that allows you to play any song you want in the arcade game if you know how
941320	943600	to load it on your USB memory card.
943600	951680	So I do believe now that was the final F-you from Rockstar getting the last cut in before
951680	952680	they went down.
952680	953680	I think they knew that was happening.
953680	955680	And now you have this nice relic on your wall.
955680	956680	I do.
956680	959600	We have a signed In the Groove poster, In the Groove 2 poster from last year's Digital
959600	960600	Life.
960600	962080	I'm looking for millions on eBay next week.
962080	963080	Yeah, right.
963080	964080	I'm kidding.
964080	965080	Millions of pennies.
965080	968680	Here's a little something else though for those arcade owners out there with an In the
968680	974080	Groove machine with this update on it.
974080	981320	If the RIA catches you playing a song that's not licensed, you can be sued for a lot of
981320	982320	money.
982320	988400	So keep that in mind with this wonderful unlocked machine if you want to.
988400	991720	I mean, you can get sued, so there you go.
991720	993960	What if the arcade has a jukebox license?
993960	995400	If they do, but not many do.
995400	1001240	So most of them think, okay, I'm safe because the game's music is licensed.
1001240	1004200	That doesn't include stuff that people load on there.
1004200	1008360	Well, more to come on this as it develops here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1008360	1010440	We would like to open an invitation.
1010440	1015560	We know there are folks in the music game industry who listen to this program.
1015560	1019940	If anyone from Rocks or Games would like to come on the show, present their side of things,
1019940	1021200	the door is open.
1021200	1024160	If anyone from Konami would like to come on the show and talk about the future of In the
1024160	1027200	Groove now that they've got it, the door is open.
1027200	1029720	You can go to the contact us on our website.
1029720	1030960	We'd love to have you on the program.
1030960	1035440	That is awesome now that I have the In the Groove 2 beta for PlayStation 2 because that'll
1035440	1037240	never be released now.
1037240	1038240	Probably not.
1038240	1039880	Never say never, but probably not.
1039880	1042480	All right, back to the normal list of topics.
1042480	1048400	Anyways, speaking of stuff that we think will never be released, and that would be a working
1048400	1054280	firmware for the PSP, but the next big firmware update, 3.0, is coming and supposedly coming
1054280	1059200	tomorrow, or the 19th for most people out there.
1059200	1061600	Anyways, what does that mean to you?
1061600	1066960	Well, if this is the big old firmware story that we've been waiting for, it's going to
1066960	1074600	have the PlayStation emulation in there, as well as support for linking up to the PlayStation
1074600	1079000	3 for remote play, whatever the hell that is supposed to be, but I guess we'll find
1079000	1083640	out when the PlayStation 3 comes out, and it's not a big surprise that that is coming
1083640	1091440	out tomorrow, seeing as Sony is having their gamer's day for basically covering all the
1091440	1098760	PlayStation 3 stuff and PSP stuff, you know, on Thursday, so that's pretty cool.
1098760	1105360	And yeah, so lots of good, lots of big stuff, and I'm sure a lot more ways to stop you from
1105360	1109240	running homebrew software, so enjoy.
1109240	1112840	I'm sure this will be on the next Grand Theft Auto anyway, so it'll have to update no matter
1112840	1113840	what.
1113840	1121040	All right, well, something that's kind of interesting in the Sony area, now this isn't
1121040	1125320	really officially supported by Sony, but you know, we've been talking about, you know,
1125320	1128920	high definition, high definition is like the next gen of gaming, well, did you know that
1128920	1132360	you could do high definition with your PlayStation 2?
1132360	1138760	Yes, that's right, there is a boot disk that's out there, and it's from, let's see, it's
1138760	1143600	called the Exploder HDTV Player, and it's by a company called Silicon Era, or at least
1143600	1146080	that's the, I'm sorry, no, that's the website that originally ran the story.
1146080	1148280	It's actually Exploder, I think, is the company.
1148280	1150340	Exploder is the company.
1150340	1155340	It says here that what you can do is that if you have a 1080i supporting TV, you can
1155340	1160200	load this tool before starting the game, and then what you can do is inside the menus,
1160200	1164960	you can select which resolution you want to run the game at, and that this Exploder program
1164960	1171840	is going to automatically, I suppose, upcode your, you know, existing PlayStation 2 resolution
1171840	1173460	to 1080i.
1173460	1177480	No idea exactly how successful that's going to turn out, but if they're putting this product
1177480	1178920	out there, they must feel pretty confident.
1178920	1181000	You know what that strangely reminds me of, though?
1181000	1182000	Blamecast.
1182000	1185520	Kind of, but this isn't for a specific game.
1185520	1190240	Well, no, I understand that, but they were wanting to do something very similar to use
1190240	1194840	the better graphics processing of the Dreamcast to play other PlayStation games, too.
1194840	1198900	I think it's sort of along the same lines.
1198900	1201440	So I still don't know if this is something I would pick up, though.
1201440	1205180	It just seems a little too risky to me, and I don't know if the PlayStation 2 game was
1205180	1206800	not designed for high def.
1206800	1209680	It's going to be kind of funky in this transition, so I don't know if that's something I want.
1209680	1210680	Why?
1210680	1211680	The PlayStation 3 is doing the same thing.
1211680	1212680	Oh, okay.
1212680	1213680	Why not?
1213680	1214680	All right.
1214680	1215680	So, I mean, it could happen.
1215680	1216680	I mean, who knows?
1216680	1217680	Stranger things, I guess.
1217680	1218680	All right.
1218680	1225120	Well, since you brought up the PS3, there actually is a little bit more news about the
1225120	1230420	Blu-ray discs and the developers that are working on them, that they're actually close
1230420	1233720	to the 25 gigabyte limit for a lot of the games.
1233720	1240320	And there's a lot of talk that we're putting movies in there, non-interactive content,
1240320	1251200	and we pretty much have an admission on that from one of the folks with Sony.
1251200	1259200	Actually the one to speak with was Phil Harrison, who was the world studio guy.
1259200	1266080	But basically what he said, and this is a quote, is, I see nothing wrong with having
1266080	1270220	non-interactive full HD sequences as part of a game.
1270220	1272840	That's all part of the production value and experience you get when you buy the game.
1272840	1275960	I don't see that as a weakness at all.
1275960	1280200	It's a weakness if it's going to cut down on game time and playability.
1280200	1285600	I think it's a lot of the stuff is, because they are outporting the 1080p, a lot of it's
1285600	1293360	just higher res textures, or in the case you've got your high def video and stuff in there,
1293360	1296040	which some of that's fine.
1296040	1301960	And also they could be doing less compression on it because the Blu-ray drives are slower.
1301960	1304800	Because they are slower, well actually you would think they would do more compression
1304800	1307680	if they had slower Blu-ray drives, whatever.
1307680	1310680	I'm no developer, so what the hell do I know about content?
1310680	1316520	All I know is 25 gigs is a lot for a game, and it better damn looked good for 25 gigs.
1316520	1317520	That's all I got to say.
1317520	1319520	Wait until they have to deal with the 50.
1319520	1322160	What are we going to see then?
1322160	1323160	More movies?
1323160	1324160	Defective discs.
1324160	1328800	Hopefully a Playstation 3 that will take out my trash and do my dishes.
1328800	1329800	Then I buy it.
1329800	1330800	At launch.
1330800	1334800	New for PS3, Turbo Tax!
1334800	1339480	Anyways, some really cool stuff coming to the Playstation 3, and this is also coming
1339480	1342600	out of Sony's Gamer Day.
1342600	1347360	First off, their brand new e-distribution titles, or their Sony arcade, whatever the
1347360	1349160	hell you want to call it.
1349160	1351600	Some pretty cool stuff actually.
1351600	1357840	Very interesting ones, like for example, there's a new game that kind of resembles Geometry
1357840	1362240	Wars, which is kind of neat, called Blast Factor.
1362240	1366560	There's going to be Lemmings 2, which apparently is not a port of the original Lemmings 2,
1366560	1371360	but is a brand new Lemmings game, you know, updated graphics and whatnot.
1371360	1377520	Go Sudoku, because, god, there's just not enough Sudoku out there.
1377520	1382000	Swizzle Blocks, which I don't know what that is, but it sounds like a puzzle game.
1382000	1390000	Criminal Crackdown, and, well, Flow, because that was previously announced.
1390000	1392960	I saw some of the screenshots for some of these games, looked interesting.
1392960	1399480	I, Blast Factor looked pretty cool, and the graphics looked pretty pristine on it, so
1399480	1402880	I don't know if it's just a TV or screenshots that they're showing, but...
1402880	1406620	I'm hoping out of this Gamer's Day thing that will have already happened by the time most
1406620	1411720	of you hear this, we will see a little more, like, in the means of footage, and kind of
1411720	1415200	made, like, not so much screenshots, but actual footage, kind of what they look like in action.
1415200	1419600	You know what I wish they had is like a console that's just these mini-games, because that
1419600	1420600	would be pretty cool.
1420600	1423600	Well, what about one of those crappy plug-and-play joystick things?
1423600	1427000	No, I'm talking about, like, an online service or something where you can download, I mean,
1427000	1430040	I hate these, all these arcade things and stuff.
1430040	1431720	Isn't that what Phantom wanted to be?
1431720	1433720	Yeah, but the Phantom was lame.
1433720	1434720	So wait, so you're...
1434720	1436480	No, Phantom wanted to do full games.
1436480	1439280	Did you just say that you want the Phantom to come out?
1439280	1440840	I did not say I wanted the Phantom to come out.
1440840	1443360	Are you gonna run over to GameStop and reserve your Phantom?
1443360	1446440	The Phantom is just a really crappy PC.
1446440	1453080	Now, granted, the case looked pretty, pretty lame, but actually the case reminded me of
1453080	1456640	something that would be in, like, Half-Life 2 or something, and I liked the glowing light
1456640	1457640	on the front.
1457640	1460720	But that's all I liked about the Phantom, and I wouldn't touch that fucking lap board
1460720	1462640	with the 10-foot pole.
1462640	1467840	All right, well, for those that were worried that they may not get a hand on the PlayStation
1467840	1472680	3 this year, you should probably still be a little bit worried, but it is said that
1472680	1479560	they are on target to produce 1 million PlayStation 3s in 2006.
1479560	1483600	Sony has confirmed they are aiming for 1 million PlayStation 3s in North America by the end
1483600	1484760	of this year.
1484760	1489040	For day one, we're gonna have a total of 400,000 units for the launch period only for
1489040	1493120	North America, and we expect to have about 1 million units by the end of the calendar
1493120	1494120	year.
1494120	1498720	These are some pretty aggressive numbers, and that comes from Kazurai himself.
1498720	1502660	So those that were thinking that PlayStation 3 was gonna get delayed a little further in
1502660	1507160	the U.S., such as something I actually speculated previously on the show, I was wrong.
1507160	1512440	Yes, and I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is still launching spring of 2006, like they previously
1512440	1513440	said.
1513440	1517640	I do think the machine's gonna launch, but I think we're gonna see Xbox 360 shortages
1517640	1519160	all over again.
1519160	1521140	I'm not too disappointed.
1521140	1523560	I don't really need one at launch this time next year.
1523560	1524760	Yeah, I'll probably have one.
1524760	1528000	Honestly, the only reason I feel like I should own one of these at launch is because of the
1528000	1529000	show.
1529000	1530920	But I'll also go to Jamie's house and play hers.
1530920	1535840	We can see if that 1080p is worth a damn, since my TV will run it.
1535840	1536840	Yep.
1536840	1538120	You know what, though?
1538120	1541680	I think I'm still just gonna use it as a paperweight.
1541680	1542840	Well, we'll see.
1542840	1543840	We'll see.
1543840	1548400	Well, speaking of things to see, I do have a list of release dates for our buddies in
1548400	1550200	the U.K.
1550200	1555080	On the 26th is Anos 1701 for PC.
1555080	1560640	A bunch of other stuff on the 27th, and I'm not going to list all the systems they're
1560640	1566040	on because there's a few multiple releases, but there's Action Loop, Blade Dancer, Lineage
1566040	1572160	of Light, Dark Messiah, Might and Magic, Dragon Ball Z, Tenkaichi Budokai 2, Dragon Warriors
1572160	1577760	Volume 2, FIFA 07, Ford Street Racing, LA Duel, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, Metal
1577760	1583160	Slug, Metal Slug Anthology, Myst Ultimate Compilation, NBA 2K7, blah, blah, blah, Neo
1583160	1589640	Geo Battle Colosseum, Pipa Funnel, Pipa Funnel 2 on GBA, by the way, Pipa Funnel, Take the
1589640	1597320	Reigns, Prince of Persia Trilogy, Pro Evolution Soccer 6, Sudoku Master, Sims 2 Pets, Tiger
1597320	1603880	Woods PGA Tour 2007, Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Double Agent, Warhammer 40K, War of Dawn,
1603880	1608400	Dark Crusade, if you want to play Warhammer, just go buy the figures, Zoo Tycoon 2, Marine
1608400	1613640	Mania, and on the 31st Legend of Spyro, A New Beginning, although I'd just rather go
1613640	1615160	trick or treating.
1615160	1617640	Spyro's not that bad.
1617640	1624440	Spyro is an in-joke on Spyro's message board that I moderate on.
1624440	1627400	I'm going to be seeing Whoop 11 on that day, so screw Spyro.
1627400	1628400	Anywho...
1628400	1629400	Nerd!
1629400	1630400	I know!
1630400	1631800	Did you get any more nerdier tonight?
1631800	1633480	I'm going to go see a Trekkie band.
1633480	1635440	Are you wearing a pocket protector?
1635440	1636440	No.
1636440	1637440	Anywho...
1637440	1639880	I do have a chainmail bra.
1639880	1642560	La la la la la.
1642560	1646040	So there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week.
1646040	1649640	We've actually got some pretty cool stuff like, for example, Marvel Ultimate Alliance
1649640	1656000	will be coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, and the 360, and I believe the PSP as well.
1656000	1660200	Some other fun games, Reservoir Dogs, the ultra-violent game, will be on Playstation
1660200	1661840	2 and Xbox.
1661840	1667120	We've got Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, and GameCube.
1667120	1674840	Nicktoons Battle for Volcano Island on Playstation 2, GameCube DS, and Game Boy Advance.
1674840	1681200	And of course, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam will be coming out on the DS and Game Boy Advance,
1681200	1683200	so that should be pretty neat.
1683200	1688000	And of course for you RPG fans, we've got Phantasy Star Universe coming out on Playstation
1688000	1692620	2, PC, and on the 360.
1692620	1697720	And other fun stuff, well these are a little bit way off now, and even more way off than
1697720	1699920	we mentioned last week.
1699920	1706280	I unfortunately have to give you guys the bad news that DDR Universe has been delayed
1706280	1708760	into March of 2007.
1708760	1710480	How do you know this?
1710480	1711480	From my work.
1711480	1712480	Alright.
1712480	1713480	It's from Konami themselves.
1713480	1714480	Alright.
1714480	1717320	So, you know, I'm not surprised because all their other games...
1717320	1719040	Could they change it back?
1719040	1720240	It could very well change back.
1720240	1726200	I don't think it will change back, because that's a pretty large jump there, so yeah.
1726200	1729920	I would say March, because it makes sense, I mean it's just like Beatmania last year,
1729920	1732120	so no big deal.
1732120	1736040	There have been some price drops on some 360 games in case you're interested.
1736040	1740120	You know what though, I want to say real quick, for folks that were very critical of DDR Universe's
1740120	1744400	build at E3, that could actually be good news that they went back and retooled some things.
1744400	1747600	Because you know a lot of people were bitching about the interface on Universe and things
1747600	1748600	like that.
1748600	1752920	Remember when people complained about UltraMix 2, they went back and retooled it, and that
1752920	1756960	came out, in my mind, still the best DDR home release they've done yet.
1756960	1762480	So I'm not saying they are, I don't know, but that could be good news.
1762480	1767560	I'd rather them wait and get it right, you know.
1767560	1768560	Let's see, well anyways...
1768560	1771120	Or they're putting in the groove songs in it.
1771120	1772640	Just kidding, no.
1772640	1775320	A few price drops here.
1775320	1780200	We have Hitman Blood Money for the 360s dropped down to $39.99.
1780200	1784720	Every other version for Hitman Blood Money has actually dropped $10, so that's pretty
1784720	1785720	good.
1785720	1790000	Tomb Raider Legends dropped down to $29.99 for the 360, and all the other versions have
1790000	1792000	dropped also $10.
1792000	1796400	And finally, Condemned, which wasn't that expensive to begin with, and actually was
1796400	1799560	$39.99 for a while now, is now $29.99.
1799560	1803080	So if you haven't picked it up yet, probably a good time to do it.
1803080	1808640	Because it is the only Survivor Horror game, pretty much, on the 360.
1808640	1810880	Comments in our chatroom on Spyro.
1810880	1815080	Jeremy Todd 1 says, I remember I had a Spyro game for the GBA, and I got stuck on the 4th
1815080	1817920	or 5th world, and then I gave it away.
1817920	1822360	Separoth1215 says, Spyro is now voiced by Elijah Wood, I guess that's further proof
1822360	1823360	he's jumped the shark.
1823360	1827200	SSJ100Matt says, Spyro needs to end, it's time for him to grow up and burninate the
1827200	1828200	countryside.
1828200	1829200	There you go.
1829200	1834000	Well I was going to mention also, there was a game that actually came out last week, or
1834000	1837920	this week depending on when you're listening to the show I guess.
1837920	1840120	Splinter Cell Double Agent for the 360.
1840120	1845060	It is going to be one of the first titles that will support the brand new fall dashboard
1845060	1848600	update for the 360, and it will support 1080p.
1848600	1849600	So that's pretty sweet.
1849600	1853920	Well we'll have to see how sexy that looks on a TV that can support it.
1853920	1857000	Again, we'll be going over to Jamie's house.
1857000	1859560	Because she has to have all the big toys, because she's a nerd.
1859560	1865320	Hey, it's not just me, it's the fact that my husband has this, oh my god I need resolution!
1865320	1868040	I need a TV that's bigger than god!
1868040	1871720	Speaking of nerds, you have to be a little bit nerdy if you're importing your games from
1871720	1872720	Japan.
1872720	1877560	You know, I've imported a couple games from Japan, I wear that nerd badge with pride.
1877560	1881660	For those of you guys that are importing games from Japan, here's some games that are coming
1881660	1884480	out this week, or if you live in Japan, and you can just walk down the street and pick
1884480	1885640	up some of these games.
1885640	1892880	We have Nizu no Senoritsu 2, I'm sorry Senoritsu 2, which is coming out from Kid, it's an adventure
1892880	1897080	game, and of course it's the sequel to Nizu no Senoritsu 1, which is entering best hits
1897080	1898400	as well this week.
1898400	1901840	That all goes down on October 26th, 2006.
1901840	1905960	Princess Princess comes out from Marvelous Entertainment, it's also an adventure game.
1905960	1910720	I noticed the cover has these three anime looking chicks, who I would speculate might
1910720	1912640	be the princesses in this game.
1912640	1918640	Although there's two princesses in that title and three on the box, so, I don't know.
1918640	1923880	Also coming out from D3 is Mermaid Prism, another adventure game coming out October
1923880	1925200	26th.
1925200	1930360	And lastly on my list here we have Utaware Rumono, yet another adventure game, but this
1930360	1933640	one coming to us from Aqua Plus.
1933640	1935440	Check that out this week in Japan.
1935440	1936440	Sweet.
1936440	1938920	Is that Utaware?
1938920	1941140	Oh, probably.
1941140	1943800	Why do I do the Japanese releases?
1943800	1946280	I've never taken a lick of a Japanese class.
1946280	1947280	I think we need to.
1947280	1950480	I mean, I love our UK people, but I can trade.
1950480	1952520	I love them too.
1952520	1953520	Let me at them.
1953520	1954880	I love our Japanese people too.
1954880	1955880	Alright.
1955880	1958720	We'll talk that up behind the scenes, because you've actually had Japanese class, so I butcher
1958720	1959720	those words.
1959720	1960720	So.
1960720	1961720	I was just wondering.
1961720	1962720	I openly admit.
1962720	1963720	I can't see through you.
1963720	1969520	I just did the Japanese release dates because they were lonely and needed some love.
1969520	1973980	No one was talking about them anywhere, so, you know.
1973980	1980360	I took them into my home and I sheltered them, even if I did horribly butcher their names.
1980360	1982360	And releasing in Antarctica?
1982360	1983360	Nothing.
1983360	1985360	Sorry, guys.
1985360	1992080	However, being released in nowhere is actually, speaking of things that aren't actually going
1992080	2000840	to be making it out, I should say, the major UK retailers, Currys and Dixons, are not going
2000840	2009440	to be stocking Canis Canem Edit, which, for those of us in the US, is a bully.
2009440	2013360	One of their spokespeople said, we have no plans to stock Canis Canem Edit.
2013360	2016600	We are fully aware people will be able to buy this game elsewhere, but we feel this
2016600	2021400	game is not appropriate for Currys' family-friendly image.
2021400	2022400	Eat it.
2022400	2023400	It's Latin, right?
2023400	2024400	Okay.
2024400	2027240	I don't think I take Latin.
2027240	2028240	You do the Japanese words.
2028240	2029240	I'll do the Latin words.
2029240	2031240	Here we go.
2031240	2032240	Whatever.
2032240	2035400	Orange Lounge Radio.
2035400	2036840	We are high school graduates.
2036840	2040640	Anyway, it's going to be out October 27th.
2040640	2044440	It has a 15 rating.
2044440	2045440	It's not that bad of a game.
2045440	2050800	It got really good reviews and apparently the character at the end, spoiler alert, becomes
2050800	2055640	an upstanding citizen who gives more than he takes.
2055640	2057440	And makes out with boys as well as girls.
2057440	2058840	Is this true?
2058840	2061240	I think there are certain characters that you can make out with.
2061240	2063520	I need to quit this game.
2063520	2064520	No thank you.
2064520	2065520	The kid's what, 15?
2065520	2068520	No thank you.
2068520	2073040	Anyways, Grand Theft Auto IV.
2073040	2074040	Again, it's way off.
2074040	2076360	It's supposed to be coming out in October next year.
2076360	2077360	Like a year from now?
2077360	2078360	Yeah.
2078360	2079360	And I cannot wait.
2079360	2085480	But no, anyway, the PlayStation 3 is also getting exclusive episodic content.
2085480	2087720	Okay, listen now.
2087720	2093220	Rockstar, do you know what the word exclusive means?
2093220	2097200	It means one system, Getty, the other system, no Getty.
2097200	2098920	So you know what?
2098920	2103440	Maybe both Getty, some content, okay.
2103440	2106760	Anyways, so both of them will have online.
2106760	2109140	Don't ever read children's story time books.
2109140	2112080	Don't ever do that because you can't do it.
2112080	2113400	Shut up.
2113400	2114400	She can't speak Latin.
2114400	2116620	I can't speak Japanese and you can't read to children.
2116620	2117800	That's fine.
2117800	2123240	Anyways, so yeah, it's going to get episodic content, not a big surprise, and what might
2123240	2126880	be different is the content might be different for each platform, who knows.
2126880	2130400	My guess, no, because they are lazy, so it will be the same on both platforms.
2130400	2131560	I think you're wrong.
2131560	2136360	I think it's like Soul Calibur II, where you had one character on the, I'm not saying literally
2136360	2140520	this is it, but you know how you had Link on the GameCube and Spawn on the Xbox and
2140520	2145320	Heihachi on the PlayStation, and it was, you know, that was their exclusive content per
2145320	2146320	console.
2146320	2150220	What you're going to get in Grand Theft Auto is you're going to get like, you know, West
2150220	2156440	Island on the PlayStation and East Island on the Xbox, and the Wii gets nothing.
2156440	2162800	Rob, if you've ever played the multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories,
2162800	2163800	they're lazy.
2163800	2166160	They are not going to make new content.
2166160	2169280	We would be lucky if the original content works correctly.
2169280	2172860	If we had to wait a goddamn year for the game, I would think they have enough time to make
2172860	2177120	West Island and East Island.
2177120	2178560	West Side and East Side.
2178560	2179560	Exactly.
2179560	2181560	I was waiting for that.
2181560	2185120	Meanwhile, who won that Battlefield thing earlier in the show?
2185120	2186120	That was Jason from Florida?
2186120	2187120	Yeah.
2187120	2188120	I think that was his name.
2188120	2189120	All right.
2189120	2192080	Well, Jason from Florida, be careful before you install Battlefield 2142.
2192080	2196160	Something you might want to consider is that this letter that leaked to various gaming
2196160	2203440	blogs this week that basically says that there is IGA advertising technology in the game.
2203440	2208840	Now, the purpose of this technology is to deliver advertisements when you use the software
2208840	2209840	on the Internet.
2209840	2215080	It's basically going to collect anonymous information to measure what types of ads you
2215080	2219540	should be seeing based on, you know, where you live and things of that nature.
2219540	2222920	It's kind of anonymously looking at your IP or what have you.
2222920	2227720	And of course, everyone is going flipping nuts on forums about this, like, how dare
2227720	2234600	EA spy on me, how this is an invasion of my privacy, I was going to buy Battlefield 2142
2234600	2237280	but now I'm not, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2237280	2238800	Loki had some strong opinions on this.
2238800	2239800	Yeah.
2239800	2241000	It's retarded is what it is.
2241000	2246300	And the reason it's retarded is because this is retarded or the reaction, the backlash
2246300	2247300	is retarded.
2247300	2248520	And this is why.
2248520	2252380	It's for just those fucking dynamic ads that are in the game.
2252380	2256680	But all it looks at is your IP address to figure out where the hell in the world you
2256680	2257680	are.
2257680	2262360	So if you're in France, that the ads aren't in English, they're in French or they're for
2262360	2266160	products that come out in France, you know, stuff like that.
2266160	2271840	So it, you know, and also it's collecting information on how many views of said ad you
2271840	2278520	have made so that they can go and, you know, bill whomever, you know, their clients.
2278520	2282640	Our friend and pal and buddy VXChaseNXV in chat is jumping up and down screaming.
2282640	2287560	An IP address is not anonymous information, grr argh.
2287560	2288560	Get over it, people.
2288560	2292440	Seriously, it's not like saying we're collecting your credit card information.
2292440	2294760	We're going to be watching where you're browsing on the internet.
2294760	2296200	It's just a goddamn IP.
2296200	2298040	It's just figuring out where you are in the world.
2298040	2300560	I don't think EA is the first company to be watching you.
2300560	2301560	No.
2301560	2302560	War of the Warcraft.
2302560	2305600	Every time you sign into Xbox Live, Microsoft knows what you're playing and they track it
2305600	2307760	on the internet for your friends to see.
2307760	2311200	So War of the Warcraft, you know, they, you know, monitor your computer for spyware, but
2311200	2315040	oh my God, they can be monitoring for other things, you know.
2315040	2316040	It's just, whatever.
2316040	2320160	I used somebody's IP address to track down when I was being stalked.
2320160	2327840	Well, yeah, I mean, you could, I don't, they might be collecting your IP address, but they're
2327840	2328840	just using that for this.
2328840	2329840	I don't think they care where your house is.
2329840	2332400	Yeah, I don't think they're going to come knock on your door, sir, you've been playing
2332400	2333400	too much of our game.
2333400	2337280	Well, they don't care that, you know, you've been looking, you know, it's, you know, porn
2337280	2338280	all the day.
2338280	2341520	What they should have done, I guess, what would be the common, you know, the happy medium
2341520	2346800	here is have you sign up on their website or whatever, putting your address information
2346800	2351640	in there and then you don't have to have your IP tracked because they'll go off that address
2351640	2354920	and send you ads based on where you live via that.
2354920	2358840	DMN says, but this allows for date people in insert zip code here.
2358840	2359840	That shit's annoying.
2359840	2361720	Microsoft doesn't hit you with shitty ads.
2361720	2363280	Yes, they do.
2363280	2367040	Download our artist video of the month on Xbox Live this week.
2367040	2371160	Buy a Yaris from the Xbox Live Arcade because no one else is.
2371160	2372160	Buy a Sion.
2372160	2379160	I just feel sorry for people like in my home state having to see ads for, you know, all
2379160	2381680	kinds of, you know, heat hauling.
2381680	2387000	What about the official Xbox Magazine that makes you watch stupid commercials to unlock
2387000	2393000	points in their disk to unlock a further demo, which by the way is probably already on Xbox
2393000	2396960	Live Marketplace anyways.
2396960	2399440	What I think is interesting though, let's look at the bigger picture here.
2399440	2401000	Loki, what do you think of this?
2401000	2404400	The bigger picture that people are saying is bullshit, is that I'm paying, you know,
2404400	2408840	60 bucks, 50 bucks, whatever for a game that has advertising in it.
2408840	2409840	That's too much money.
2409840	2412240	If the game has advertising in it, it shouldn't cost me that much money.
2412240	2415280	Does it cost you anything to play online?
2415280	2417320	No, it doesn't.
2417320	2418320	You know why?
2418320	2424480	Because that money that they're making from advertising helps run the servers.
2424480	2429040	I'm just surprised that someone with such a philosophy is actually kind of supporting
2429040	2430040	this in a way.
2430040	2431040	It's kind of interesting.
2431040	2433360	I don't see a problem with it, and to be honest, so what?
2433360	2436820	There's fucking ads on billboards that are in this world.
2436820	2443720	It's not like, you know, my character has a fucking, you know, date hot people or whatever
2443720	2447960	in this zip code strapped to his body or something.
2447960	2449460	It's not like they're that obtrusive.
2449460	2451080	They're just on fucking billboards.
2451080	2455100	I don't notice what the hell are on billboards in the game, and if you're sitting there staring
2455100	2459120	at the fucking billboard, you're probably going to get shot or stepped on by a giant
2459120	2460120	robot.
2460120	2463040	So, whatever.
2463040	2465840	If you're really going to get your panties in the bunch for that, I don't want to see
2465840	2468480	you playing Battlefield 2142 anyways.
2468480	2469840	Go play another game.
2469840	2474120	VX Jason says, give me the ability to run my own server and fuck your advertisements.
2474120	2477120	You think people are going to end up hacking this game to take the shit out?
2477120	2478440	Sure, why not?
2478440	2483120	They've done it before with other games, so I don't see why they couldn't.
2483120	2484120	All right.
2484120	2490320	Well, all this talk of privacy and invading our privacy and, you know, ruffling our feathers
2490320	2491320	here.
2491320	2493680	It's, you know, the internet versus EA and what have you.
2493680	2501520	It makes us a little bit angsty, so that means we have to bring on the FUs of the week.
2501520	2519960	Yes, the antibiotic that they prescribe quite often for a sinus infection, so I guess it
2519960	2524920	really is rooted to my sinus infection that I'm still not, you know, done with.
2524920	2530400	But I would like to actually be able to digest solid food, please, drugs, hurry up and be
2530400	2535040	done with me so that I can actually eat a pizza without wanting to die.
2535040	2538160	Not love me.
2538160	2542520	F you to my head hurting because I have a headache right now and it's one of those ones
2542520	2547160	that's not really that bad, but it's in the back of my skull and that sucks because there's
2547160	2553520	no way to get rid of it, so I fucking hate that and I get them so often.
2553520	2554520	It's from your neck?
2554520	2556360	It's from a tumor.
2556360	2557520	It's not a tumor.
2557520	2562400	F you to the fact that I'm getting on a red-eye flight tomorrow night to New York City and
2562400	2563480	I'm getting sick.
2563480	2565040	I can feel my body getting sick.
2565040	2568000	I know this because I was cold in my office all day and I usually don't get cold unless
2568000	2570160	I'm getting sick, so that's just great.
2570160	2572960	I'm getting sick to ruin my vacation in New York City.
2572960	2573960	Yay!
2573960	2574960	Joint excitement.
2574960	2575960	F you to viruses.
2575960	2576960	New York City?
2576960	2577960	Sorry.
2577960	2578960	Shut up.
2578960	2580960	Get a rope.
2580960	2587720	Anyways, moving on.
2587720	2595400	Well, speaking of things that are moving at least, we've got a track listing for Elite
2595400	2602400	Beat Agents, so if anybody who is interested, and actually, again, the release for that
2602400	2608840	is going to be November 6th over here in the US, but the songs that are going to be in
2608840	2615200	it is Walkie Talkie Man by Stereogram, ABC, Jackson 5, Skater Boy, Avril Lavigne, I Was
2615200	2619480	Born to Love You, Queen, Rock This Town, Stray Cats, which is a great song, Highway Star,
2619480	2625400	Deep Purple, YMCA, Village People, September, Earth, Wind & Fire, Canned Heat, Jamiroquai,
2625400	2632800	Material Girl, Madonna, Lala, Ashley Simpson, you're the inspiration, Chicago.
2632800	2636560	You know I used to actually have that on a 45.
2636560	2639760	Nerd.
2639760	2642680	No that just meant it was the 80s.
2642680	2650360	Survivor, Destiny's Child, Without a Fight, Hoobastank, Believe, Cher, that's so gay,
2650360	2654480	Let's Dance, David Bowie, I love David Bowie, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Rolling Stones, Makes
2654480	2658160	No Difference, Sum 41, The Anthem, Good Charlotte.
2658160	2663080	Well, this will certainly ruffle the feathers of those folks that were expecting to get
2663080	2668520	more Japanese style music, but if that's what you wanted, import Oh and Don.
2668520	2671200	I thought they were expecting to get Japanese music.
2671200	2675240	Exactly, so this is certainly an Americanized version, it definitely is going to take this
2675240	2679060	series in a completely different direction.
2679060	2683800	You know what, although there's a couple of songs on that list that made me go, ugh, you
2683800	2688140	know any music game is going to have a couple songs that made me go, ugh, so I'm okay with
2688140	2689140	it.
2689140	2691360	I think it'll actually be fun, there's some kind of funny songs on there, so it should
2691360	2693200	be interesting to see it in this system.
2693200	2694720	I'm upset with this track list.
2694720	2695720	Why?
2695720	2702960	Because any time that Cher song is seen anywhere with my eyes, it gets stuck in my head, and
2702960	2710280	I can't get it out, and I also think of that Margaret Cho act too where she was talking
2710280	2711280	about it.
2711280	2713600	Yay, I know what game to play every time Jamie's over.
2713600	2717760	You know what, I know which ass to kick every time I'm over.
2717760	2724880	Yes, speaking of ass kicking, Red Octane or Activision have basically kicked the ass of
2724880	2730000	any third party guitar controller, because according to the official PlayStation Magazine
2730000	2736240	demo of Guitar Hero 2, they will not work, so if that's indicative of the final game,
2736240	2741600	your third party controller will no worky on the brand new game, so that kind of sucks.
2741600	2743420	At least this is based on the demo, right?
2743420	2750240	Based on the demo, but you know what, I don't know, how hard could it be to get a controller
2750240	2751240	to work?
2751240	2755360	I mean seriously, so, I don't know, we'll see, I'm sure people will find a workaround
2755360	2761160	for that, but as of right now, that's kind of poopy, seeing as Red Octane started off
2761160	2766480	as a third party controller manufacturer, and now they're just kind of saying, fuck
2766480	2767880	you all.
2767880	2771680	Yeah, so let me get this straight.
2771680	2778520	A company that got its start as a third party peripheral manufacturer has effectively locked
2778520	2784160	out third party peripheral manufacturers from their latest games.
2784160	2786280	It's a preemptive strike.
2786280	2790040	It's cutting out future competition for other third party.
2790040	2791040	It's interesting.
2791040	2792040	It's an interesting tactic.
2792040	2793040	I mean that's business.
2793040	2797560	You can hem and haw all you want about Red Octane or bastard people, they're hypocrites,
2797560	2799400	blah, blah, blah, but that's just business.
2799400	2804760	There was basically the official controller, they way it kind of recognized it was an official
2804760	2809960	controller is because they had the left button shorted out, kind of like how pop-in music
2809960	2811000	has that.
2811000	2814640	They have a button shorted out to be able to detect that it's the official pop-in music
2814640	2815640	controller.
2815640	2822080	What's interesting though is there's some speculation that this was to lock out those
2822080	2828240	third party wireless controllers because Red Octane was coming out with their own wireless
2828240	2830560	controller for the PlayStation 2.
2830560	2831560	Interesting.
2831560	2836440	Well, if guitars aren't your thing and singing is more your style, you already know the karaoke
2836440	2841160	revolution American Idol is coming out on the PlayStation 2 pretty soon and Konami is
2841160	2847400	going to be launching a tour to find the first virtual American Idol.
2847400	2851880	And if you win this and you are the virtual American Idol, you will win airfare, accommodations
2851880	2857040	and tickets to a taping of the real American Idol TV show so you can look at the better
2857040	2858040	singers.
2858040	2859720	Oh boy.
2859720	2864720	Even if you just participate, you'll still get, what is this, a contest t-shirt and a
2864720	2869240	coupon for $5 off when pre-ordering through konami.com.
2869240	2871980	If you win in your region, you do get a free copy of the game.
2871980	2876820	So this is going on tour around the nation and let's see, Loki, I want you to keep November
2876820	2882840	4th clear because we're taking a trip to San Francisco to go to the Stone's Town Galleria
2882840	2885280	because you know you owe it to the listeners to participate in this.
2885280	2886280	I am not doing this.
2886280	2887280	Oh yes, he is, folks.
2887280	2888280	No, I'm not.
2888280	2892280	And we're going to tape the whole thing for the future of the Ontario TV project.
2892280	2893280	I am not doing this.
2893280	2894280	Yes, you are.
2894280	2895280	It's fine.
2895280	2896280	I am not doing this.
2896280	2897280	I know.
2897280	2898280	You're going to play this little game here where you're going to say you're not going
2898280	2899280	to do it.
2899280	2900280	No, I'm not.
2900280	2902800	And then we're going to get him and then it's supposed to be a surprise, folks.
2902800	2904640	He's just being sheepish.
2904640	2905640	Don't worry.
2905640	2908200	We'll have him there and root for him if you're in San Francisco.
2908200	2910720	I am not playing that damn game.
2910720	2916200	Bring your Loki signs, like they have on the show, Loki is my American Idol.
2916200	2918320	You know who we should take to that?
2918320	2919720	Iguana Girl.
2919720	2925240	We should, but we'll take her to another city because I've got to have Loki win this one.
2925240	2926240	No.
2926240	2929040	Iguana Girl can go and be the real winner.
2929040	2930040	That's fine.
2930040	2932960	Oh, see, look, you're getting support from our chat.
2932960	2933960	Look at all the...
2933960	2936800	They're so excited that you're going to be saying, what song are you going to do when
2936800	2938840	you try out for Karaoke Revolution America?
2938840	2940040	I'm not playing that game.
2940040	2941040	I know, I know.
2941040	2942040	Yeah, that's right, Matt.
2942040	2943040	Keep telling yourself that.
2943040	2945120	I'm not driving down there either.
2945120	2946120	Anyways.
2946120	2947120	I'll drive.
2947120	2948120	It's fine.
2948120	2949120	No.
2949120	2950120	I won't even charge you for gas.
2950120	2951760	Jamie will chip in for gas.
2951760	2952760	We'll go and dutch.
2952760	2953760	With what money?
2953760	2954760	I'm poor.
2954760	2955760	Anyways.
2955760	2957760	I'll sell the ferret.
2957760	2959240	Oh, my baby.
2959240	2965920	If dancing is more of your thing, you'll be happy to know that the ever rumored, because
2965920	2973400	everyone wanted a DDR MMO, well, Dave Perry, who you might remember from Shiny, is creating
2973400	2978200	a new MMO called Dance, which is promising players will have a chance to create their
2978200	2983480	own unique dancers, and through variable styles, facial features, and clothing accessories,
2983480	2985680	you can also be able to actually play.
2985680	2992840	It sounds very similar to O2Jam or something like that, but it should be pretty interesting.
2992840	2996480	Obviously, when I first read the news on this, it sounds very similar to one of those popular
2996480	3001800	Korean music games, such as O2Jam, R2B, one of those types of games, kind of an Americanized
3001800	3005800	dish, you know, I wouldn't say it's an Americanized version of this, but that idea, that concept
3005800	3009640	in a localized MMO should be interesting.
3009640	3011120	I'll check it out if it's free.
3011120	3014640	I mean, it can't be free, right?
3014640	3016640	Exactly.
3016640	3020080	Will they be watching my IP, though, and delivering me in-game ads?
3020080	3021080	You betcha.
3021080	3026320	Actually, I think this was one of the ones that they were talking about supporting it
3026320	3030400	with ads, because it was going to be free, but it might have been another game, I don't
3030400	3031400	know.
3031400	3032400	All right.
3032400	3036600	Well, every week, you send us emails, and Dark Soccer writes down your IPs with a big
3036600	3037600	magic marker.
3037600	3041000	And then I lock them down to your zip code.
3041000	3044200	Sends them to the spam factory to say, no, I'm just kidding.
3044200	3046900	Of course, we never give out your emails, addresses, or IP.
3046900	3048560	We wouldn't do that to you.
3048560	3049560	We're not the man.
3049560	3052160	But we will read what you write to us on air.
3052160	3056200	Actually, I find where you live, and if your letter sucks, I leave Stinky Poo on your front
3056200	3057200	doorstep.
3057200	3058200	Oh, I see.
3058200	3059200	All right.
3059200	3064160	Well, hopefully, we've got some letters that did not earn a poo bombing this week.
3064160	3069480	Dark Soccer, open up the mailbag and pull some emails out for us.
3069480	3076840	The first one comes from, well, it doesn't really have a name on it, so I'm just going
3076840	3079040	to say Pendragon.
3079040	3084600	Actually, Aibo is not useless.
3084600	3087280	I've had this ERS-7 since they first came out.
3087280	3090280	He watches my house when I'm not there, and he has his own blog on the web.
3090280	3093280	Meet Falco at FusionCrew.org slash Falco.
3093280	3096600	That would be kind of funny.
3096600	3101560	I did want to get one at one point, but they're just too damn expensive.
3101560	3103040	I want an Eibo.
3103040	3108120	I'm in shock someone wrote us to tell us they have an Eibo that has a blog.
3108120	3109920	My Xbox 360 has a blog.
3109920	3115040	I want an Eibo that has a blog and that we'll be walking around because it randomly takes
3115040	3116040	pictures and stuff.
3116040	3119400	It's like, oh, look, there's people having sex on the couch or something like that and
3119400	3120400	posts a blog.
3120400	3127600	It would just get more pictures of your foot, but I'm going to start a PayPal account for
3127600	3128600	myself.
3128600	3131560	The donate to Dark Soccer's Eibo fund.
3131560	3132560	You do that.
3132560	3135080	Let's see if I get an Eibo.
3135080	3136080	Come on, chat room.
3136080	3138240	You know you want to help me get an Eibo to replace the ferret.
3138240	3139240	Sell your goddamn TV.
3139240	3140240	Then you can afford an Eibo.
3140240	3145080	I'll get an Eibo and I'll name him Ferret.
3145080	3148120	Anyway, this is when I get my wireless router working the right way again.
3148120	3152400	You can email Falco and he'll take a picture and email it back to you.
3152400	3156400	That's at ibofalco.comcast.net, so I think that's pretty funny.
3156400	3162680	By the way, he wants us to pick him for the drawing, but I think it's a little too late.
3162680	3163680	Sorry.
3163680	3165680	Maybe you should have entered your Eibo.
3165680	3168200	Dude, I want an Eibo.
3168200	3169200	I want an Eibo to win a contest.
3169200	3171600	We should have a world's sexiest Eibo contest.
3171600	3173720	I don't want one of those ones that actually look like dogs.
3173720	3176160	I want one of the old school Eibos.
3176160	3177160	You just need to...
3177160	3178160	They're really cool.
3178160	3179160	Anyway.
3179160	3180160	This one comes from Gomez.
3180160	3182200	Hey, Orange Lounge.
3182200	3185320	This is the first time I've ever sent you guys an email because I'm kind of an Orange
3185320	3188800	Lounge noob because I only started listening about episode 196.
3188800	3190160	Nice run on sentence.
3190160	3191160	Welcome to the show.
3191160	3194560	I'm glad you've decided to stick around.
3194560	3197720	I love the show and the praise you give Xbox 360 LOL.
3197720	3201160	However, my friends and I have been having some problems with the system.
3201160	3204840	My controllers now have a mandatory tape job on the back of them to keep the batteries
3204840	3208840	connected so the controller does not disconnect due to a loss of power, which makes me really
3208840	3209840	mad.
3209840	3213200	But this doesn't compare to a friend of mine whose Xbox broke just recently, but Microsoft
3213200	3216280	was generous enough to give him a new one, which within a week was also broken.
3216280	3220280	He had to endure another couple of months without an Xbox, even though he had just bought
3220280	3221280	NHL07.
3221280	3223720	Dude, you're like the king of run on sentences.
3223720	3224720	This is awesome.
3224720	3225720	NHL07?
3225720	3226720	Boo.
3226720	3231480	The system can be a hassle when it freezes on me or the controllers disconnect in the
3231480	3235520	middle of a game or battle, but nothing makes me more mad than the controller disconnect
3235520	3236880	and because of this my Xbox freezes.
3236880	3240240	Either way, I love my Xbox 360 because of the fantastic graphics and games, and yet
3240240	3241560	I hate the frustrations.
3241560	3243640	I guess I hate it and love it.
3243640	3249280	The other topic I had to say was to do with the new Phantasy Star Universe demo that came
3249280	3251040	out to the marketplace recently.
3251040	3254920	Since I've downloaded pretty much every demo I had to play, this one pretty much got me
3254920	3257080	hooked but not before some difficulty.
3257080	3260760	I originally made myself one of those robot guy characters and pretty much held the A
3260760	3264480	button through the whole tutorial while talking to my friend, which I later found out was
3264480	3267400	a mistake because I had never played these MMO games before.
3267400	3270200	So all I could do was walk around asking people, hey, how do you battle?
3270200	3272480	Or do you know how to get money?
3272480	3277800	And my normal response would be, no, go away you noob, you suck at this game, screw off,
3277800	3279320	and ah ha ha ha, yeah right noob.
3279320	3282920	No, yeah right what a noob, which didn't help me at all because I couldn't have any fun
3282920	3285480	with this demo and made my gaming experience go down the drain.
3285480	3290960	However, I remembered Sky on your show mentioned something about being a girl in World of Warcraft
3290960	3294320	and how he got lots of items and stuff for free, so I decided to give it a try.
3294320	3298840	I made a new account and made this girl human super hot with handlebars or pigtails or whatever
3298840	3300760	you guys like to call them.
3300760	3305120	And once I entered the world, it was entirely, hello, how's it going, oh wow, you're really
3305120	3306120	hot, let's go out.
3306120	3309820	And when I said, do you guys know how to battle, oh yeah, let's go, let me show you.
3309820	3312840	Gomez responds, and the guy showed me where to go and everything even though I dished
3312840	3314920	him once I got into the battling world.
3314920	3318520	I am now given free money and items in this group because I just have to say my mic is
3318520	3321120	broken so now I can just type everything I want to say to the players.
3321120	3324880	I never knew until how many Desperate Gamer guys there really are out there.
3324880	3325880	Sincerely, Gomez.
3325880	3327680	I love this email.
3327680	3330200	This email is fantastic.
3330200	3333240	Because someone actually took a suggestion of mine and ran with it.
3333240	3334240	You know what's funny?
3334240	3339160	I'm not playing a girl in PSO because, you know, you may be new to the show so you may
3339160	3344440	not have picked up on the fact that I'm a gamer who enjoys gamers of the male variety
3344440	3345980	if you know what I mean, right?
3345980	3350440	So I actually made a character who I would find attractive who is a male, like, you know,
3350440	3352940	tall and handsome type guy, right?
3352940	3354560	And that's the character I made.
3354560	3360400	But the thing is that luckily I had the PSO experience so I kind of was able to pick up
3360400	3361400	PSU pretty quickly.
3361400	3364860	Yes, a lot's different, but I had my friends to voice chat with and kind of figure the
3364860	3365860	things out.
3365860	3370080	So what does it say about me always making short, cute girls?
3370080	3371080	Nothing.
3371080	3374360	Because you're a short, cute girl.
3374360	3383640	And I have to say that the one male character I made back in PSO, though, was a femoral.
3383640	3388440	Just be careful, though, because, you know, I do have a friend who is, like, OMG a real
3388440	3392140	female that plays Phantasy Star Universe who's been playing the beta and she has a female
3392140	3396440	character in the game and people harass her on voice chat all the time.
3396440	3399640	And not only that, like, I was partied with her, I saw this happen.
3399640	3403600	Random guys will run up to her and do those little motions that'll make it look like they're
3403600	3407860	eating her out or trying to sodomize her and, like, all this stuff.
3407860	3409320	People are so stupid.
3409320	3413320	I can't wait for this game to go pay so that all these people will have to, you know, if
3413320	3416480	that's how they want to spend their $10 a month, then fine.
3416480	3420560	But you know, at least we'll filter out a lot of the lame-os that are just playing this
3420560	3421560	because it's free.
3421560	3422560	This should have, like...
3422560	3428360	Now, what I did mean to ask, though, you've still got your mags in that game, right?
3428360	3429360	No.
3429360	3430360	You kinda have.
3430360	3431360	Damn!
3431360	3435200	You have a house pet who apparently later can be an NPC that joins you, but it's a little
3435200	3436200	different.
3436200	3438200	And you feed it stuff kind of like you did the mags, but it's a little different.
3438200	3439200	That annoys us too.
3439200	3441760	Okay, I'm going back to PSO so I can use my oppa oppa.
3441760	3443280	No, no, no, no, no.
3443280	3444280	PSU is beautiful.
3444280	3446320	I want my oppa oppa!
3446320	3449560	The first time I dual-wielded sabers, I was like, oh god, I love this game.
3449560	3450560	Oppa oppa.
3450560	3453720	Unless I can make my pet an oppa oppa, then I'll be happy.
3453720	3454720	Okay, last email.
3454720	3455720	You can name it whatever you want.
3455720	3456720	Mine's named nothing.
3456720	3457720	I want mine to look like an oppa oppa.
3457720	3459560	It kinda does, so name it oppa oppa.
3459560	3460560	Okay.
3460560	3461560	Email.
3461560	3462560	Last email.
3462560	3463560	This is from Mark.
3463560	3464560	Hey guys.
3464560	3465560	You know what?
3465560	3466560	I think that that's sexist.
3466560	3467560	Okay, I'm just kidding.
3467560	3468560	Oh.
3468560	3469560	I'm kidding.
3469560	3472560	I thought that was the email.
3472560	3474560	I was like, what?
3474560	3475560	Explain yourself.
3475560	3478840	I'm just curious as to why you released the podcast in two parts.
3478840	3482540	Is it that you can't get it all edited by Monday, or is it that you hope to get people
3482540	3485760	to listen to the live broadcast instead of having to wait for the two parts?
3485760	3488880	To be honest, I will never listen to the live broadcast because I just don't have the time.
3488880	3490640	I hope you guys can change this.
3490640	3492240	Anyhow, great show as always.
3492240	3493400	Thanks, Mark.
3493400	3494400	Because we want to.
3494400	3495400	Nana nana nana.
3495400	3496400	Nana.
3496400	3497400	No.
3497400	3500540	We did it at first because we were a little afraid.
3500540	3505080	We didn't know how the server would handle a two to three hour program being thrown out
3505080	3506640	there all at once.
3506640	3510080	So we thought by breaking it up into chunks, it wouldn't be so bad.
3510080	3512600	On our old server, we used to have to worry about bandwidth a lot.
3512600	3515320	On this one, we don't have to worry about that so much.
3515320	3519040	Hugs and kisses to our webmaster, VX Jason XV, who makes all this shit happen behind
3519040	3523280	the scenes.
3523280	3525780	We split it up in the beginning, and that's just kind of worked for us.
3525780	3531280	For us, it's a little harder to sit down and listen to this podcast.
3531280	3535480	It looks like it's three hours long than it is to just get little bits and pieces twice
3535480	3536480	a week.
3536480	3537560	I don't know how we've looked at it.
3537560	3541280	I have two words that explain it for me.
3541280	3543280	Pee break.
3543280	3548680	Hypothetically, we could, when we break the show, just put a little like...
3548680	3551560	Bobby takes a break on his show, but he'll put a little noise in there.
3551560	3553440	He'll edit out his break and put a little noise in there.
3553440	3555840	Technically, we could do that, but I don't know.
3555840	3557400	It's just kind of what's worked for us.
3557400	3559120	We might change our minds later in the future.
3559120	3563840	I don't know, but for right now, it's kind of what we're doing.
3563840	3566160	Email us if you feel strongly one way or the other because I've heard from people that
3566160	3569160	kind of like the fact that they get regular OLR content.
3569160	3570160	You won't this week.
3570160	3573640	There is no second part this week, but a lot of folks like their regular OLR.
3573640	3575040	We're irregular this week.
3575040	3576320	Yes, that's right.
3576320	3577320	We're pregnant.
3577320	3579440	Is that it for emails?
3579440	3582280	Just because someone's pregnant doesn't mean that they have irregularity.
3582280	3583280	I'm just messing.
3583280	3584280	God.
3584280	3585280	It just means they don't need enough fiber.
3585280	3586280	I'm just messing.
3586280	3587280	Jeez.
3587280	3588280	I'm getting all angsty.
3588280	3591540	I already did the FUs of the week lately.
3591540	3594160	You're catching me midweek after I got off of work.
3594160	3595160	Any more mailbag?
3595160	3596160	No.
3596160	3598320	Send us more mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
3598320	3600000	Give this woman more to read next week.
3600000	3603280	Any more stuff and give me money.
3603280	3610320	Anyways, there was an unconfirmed rumor this week, as every other week, that there may
3610320	3615800	be a Blue Dragon anime series in the works.
3615800	3625440	This is basically coming from a toy hobby figurine page from a Japanese toy company.
3625440	3637320	It wouldn't be that far of a stretch because it is created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is
3637320	3649440	the brainchild of Final Fantasy, and Dragon Ball Dragon Quest creator Akira Toyayama.
3649440	3651400	Very strong ties to anime.
3651400	3653200	They'd be kind of neat.
3653200	3658600	But he also did all of the character designs for Chrono Trigger.
3658600	3660160	You said Akira Toyama, right?
3660160	3661160	Yes.
3661160	3662160	Okay.
3662160	3667000	Yeah, he did all the character designs for Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger.
3667000	3672080	There has been short anime series for each, or segments of anime.
3672080	3675080	They have existed in anime form.
3675080	3676080	Doesn't matter.
3676080	3680400	They have existed in anime form at some point.
3680400	3686720	So I guess we'll have to see because right now it's just rumor.
3686720	3691120	If Microsoft can have their Viva Pinata show here, why can't they have a Blue Dragon anime
3691120	3692120	there?
3692120	3693120	I'd rather have Blue Dragon.
3693120	3695560	Viva Pinata sucks.
3695560	3697200	I watched the thing on Xbox.
3697200	3698200	It wasn't the end of the world.
3698200	3699200	It is!
3699200	3700200	Horrible!
3700200	3701200	Horrible!
3701200	3704640	It was bad, but if I was seven years old, I'd probably like it.
3704640	3707880	Anyway, if I was seven years old, I might enjoy Bubble Bobble.
3707880	3708880	No, I'm kidding.
3708880	3711540	Actually, you can love Bubble Bobble no matter what your age.
3711540	3713840	It is a very cute game, though, aimed at children.
3713840	3714840	But guess what, kids?
3714840	3719560	Don't buy your kids Bubble Bobble Revolution on the DS or they're going to be pissed off
3719560	3724880	because apparently this game was not play-tested past level 30.
3724880	3729960	In other words, the game is supposed to have a boss show up at level 30, and the boss does
3729960	3735120	not show up, therefore rendering the game unplayable.
3735120	3736120	Every time.
3736120	3740880	A quote from the source, we have been looking very hard into this issue with Nintendo and
3740880	3744840	have now determined that all of the cartridges that have been shipped in North America are
3744840	3745840	faulty.
3745840	3748560	Needless to say, we are extremely sorry that this situation has arisen and would like to
3748560	3750400	apologize to you for this issue.
3750400	3753800	We have already started the process whereby a corrected version is to be manufactured
3753800	3756240	and will ensure that all customers have their copies replaced.
3756240	3761120	Unfortunately, this will take 8 to 10 weeks simply because of the time required to manufacture
3761120	3762200	new carts.
3762200	3766360	We will update you with what you will need to do to get a replacement game as soon as
3766360	3767840	this has been determined.
3767840	3771200	Hey, folks, over there at Taito making this game.
3771200	3774120	How about you tell us a little bit about what you're going to do for your QA processes in
3774120	3775120	the future?
3775120	3777240	Is it only the US one?
3777240	3778440	I'm not sure.
3778440	3780760	I think it's the only region this has been released in so far.
3780760	3781760	Has it?
3781760	3782760	I thought that it was a...
3782760	3783760	Maybe.
3783760	3784760	Maybe.
3784760	3785760	It's the only place with a problem showing up.
3785760	3786760	Well, you know what?
3786760	3790960	Apparently, they were too busy playing Rainbow Islands, which also, you know, was released
3790960	3793920	the same time instead of Bubble Bobble.
3793920	3799720	I mean, words cannot express what a fuck up this is on Taito's part.
3799720	3800720	I mean, it's...
3800720	3805120	So, nobody ever played through the whole game over in their testing.
3805120	3809560	You could use cheat codes to get through, I don't know, but somehow, some way, this
3809560	3816240	really, really big flaw was overlooked.
3816240	3820400	It will make me hesitate every time I go to buy a Taito game on the DS from this point
3820400	3823560	forward, until they say what they're going to do to make it better.
3823560	3828760	I guess, but then again, you know, perhaps they've learned their lesson, so to speak,
3828760	3833560	so I don't know, who knows, maybe their QA will get a lot better real fast after this
3833560	3837720	very embarrassing screw up, but not good, folks.
3837720	3838720	Not good.
3838720	3842800	Yeah, DMN says in our chat room, someone's getting fucking fired.
3842800	3846360	Well, I'm going to raise a good point, Squeenix owns Taito now.
3846360	3851440	Oh great, maybe Final Fantasy XII will be unplayable.
3851440	3855080	I doubt that, though.
3855080	3862200	There's lots of things to doubt, though, whenever anything that's involving them is, you know,
3862200	3864800	coming about, but never mind, I'm not going to be bitter.
3864800	3866520	Not going to be bitter.
3866520	3874400	Anyway, speaking of releases and things, we have some stuff from THQ for launch week for
3874400	3878040	the Wii 4 games.
3878040	3883800	The first, of course, this is the big one, is Kars, for all of our Pixar fans, one of
3883800	3888840	who has landed in San Jose today, who I'm probably going to be hearing about this all
3888840	3889840	weekend.
3889840	3890840	We know.
3890840	3891840	We all know.
3891840	3892840	What?
3892840	3893840	I'm just messing.
3893840	3897680	Oh no, no, I'm going to be hearing about it all weekend.
3897680	3904160	Anyway, also coming out is Barnyard, Avatar the Last Airbender, and SpongeBob SquarePants
3904160	3907120	Creature from the Krusty Krab.
3907120	3910200	So this just confirms Loki's list from previously, in other words?
3910200	3911200	Yeah.
3911200	3914520	I don't remember the Barnyard title, but then again, I wouldn't have remembered that.
3914520	3918680	It's been there, and it's just like, and you know, it's just so exciting because these
3918680	3922160	are all GameCube ports of like previous months.
3922160	3925320	She could have said three games are coming out for the Wii, whoop-dee and shit, and it
3925320	3926960	would have had the exact same impact for me.
3926960	3929160	I'm just sorry, not interested in any of these titles.
3929160	3930160	You know what's really sad?
3930160	3931160	I guess Kars might be cubed.
3931160	3936080	Some of these games that I thought were new are not new, like for example, GT from Ubisoft
3936080	3941200	is apparently a port of GT for the GameCube that came out a long time ago, and same with
3941200	3946600	Monster 4x4 World Circuit, it's a port of an Xbox game that came out a while ago too.
3946600	3950320	Or I think it may have been a GameCube game at one time too, but I know the Xbox version
3950320	3956040	came out in April, and so they're nothing new, it's just a lot of ports, and I actually
3956040	3961000	cancelled my pre-order for GT because of that, so I'm like, I'm not going to buy any fucking
3961000	3964040	ports no matter how cool that little steering wheel might be.
3964040	3966600	You can buy the steering wheel if you really want it.
3966600	3967600	They are selling it separately.
3967600	3970520	Use it on an Excite truck, which apparently has no online play.
3970520	3971520	That's very disappointing.
3971520	3972520	Rob.
3972520	3973520	Rob.
3973520	3974520	Rob.
3974520	3975520	Rob.
3975520	3976520	Rob.
3976520	3977520	Rob.
3977520	3978520	Rob.
3978520	3979520	Rob.
3979520	3980520	Rob.
3980520	3981520	No.
3981520	3983660	The chat room made me!
3983660	3984820	Don't even think about it.
3984820	3986600	The chat room made me.
3986600	3988040	Rob.
3988040	3989160	What?
3989160	3992780	Low key, please save this show from going down the toilet anymore.
3992780	3994080	Sorry.
3994080	3996080	We're stuck in the U-Bend.
3996080	4002300	Anyways, so crappy Wii games, hooray.
4002300	4011580	Some things that are not so crappy, though, and quite fun, actually, Mario Kart GP 2 is
4011580	4012580	coming to an arcade.
4012580	4013580	That's the arcade one, right?
4013580	4014580	Yeah.
4014580	4015580	Hot!
4015580	4018300	Yeah, that's the game that I played while I was drunk on my bachelor party.
4018300	4019620	Why isn't that video on YouTube?
4019620	4022300	Uh, because I haven't loaded it on there yet.
4022300	4023740	We're going to let that happen.
4023740	4033540	But basically, the game itself looks very similar to what we've seen before, although
4033540	4038460	I do see some things, though, that look new, like some of the characters...
4038460	4043580	I don't know who this is, and I don't know if you would know, Rob, but this character
4043580	4045820	looks very, very familiar.
4045820	4046820	Let's see here.
4046820	4047820	I think...
4047820	4052180	No, this is from Tomogachi or whatever, I think.
4052180	4053180	That character right there.
4053180	4055580	Yeah, that looks like a Tomogachi corner shop.
4055580	4059380	So that's going to be one of the brand new characters, a Tomogachi character, and then
4059380	4068580	it looks like you've got all your repeat characters, Wario, Mario, Luigi, Waluigi, Yoshi, Princess
4068580	4077560	Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and then the ghosts, Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man.
4077560	4078560	Very interesting.
4078560	4083300	There's, of course, a lot more stuff that you can put on your character or your screen
4083300	4084300	caps.
4084300	4085300	You know how they do the webcam thing?
4085300	4089140	Yeah, it's just my little finger up and put the princess hair over it.
4089140	4093180	That's why we got to put my video on YouTube because my screen cap was hilarious when I
4093180	4094180	was drunk.
4094180	4096820	We'll work on that, folks.
4096820	4103400	If you're too poor to purchase a Mario Kart GP machine, perhaps you're also too poor to
4103400	4106340	buy a Wii, even though there's a huge difference in price.
4106340	4107340	I don't know.
4107340	4108820	That's a good question I can think of.
4108820	4113560	If you are too poor to pick up a Nintendo Wii, you might get a chance at Toys R Us.
4113560	4117180	They're doing a deal or no deal promotion.
4117180	4120100	You get these things in the newspapers that are going to be coming out.
4120100	4124580	They call them weekly circulars, and when you get one of these circulars, what you can
4124580	4129100	do is you can cut out the suitcases and you can take a deal, which is 10% off any item
4129100	4133420	in store, which I would think could be used on the Wii for a nice little saving, or no
4133420	4134420	deal.
4134420	4140220	The cashier will scan the ticket and possibly you win a Wii console or you lose your 10%
4140220	4143020	coupon and get a 5% coupon instead.
4143020	4147820	No word on the banker or a very scary looking Howie Mandel coming into play here, but supposedly
4147820	4153120	25,000 Wiis are being given away as well as a $1 million prize and a trip to Los Angeles
4153120	4160480	to go actually see the show live in person and be frightened by Howie Mandel in person.
4160480	4162380	Good luck to any of our listeners that enter this.
4162380	4168660	I forgot to mention, since we don't have the video of my playing Mario Kart GP drunk on
4168660	4174140	YouTube, you can, however, download it for your PSP on OLRPSP.com under the download
4174140	4175140	section.
4175140	4180340	I assure the listeners it will be on YouTube by the time you hear this show.
4180340	4182820	Look for username OrangeLoungeRadio.
4182820	4189900	Well, speaking of other amusing things, guess what Xbox is going to be, guess what Microsoft
4189900	4193020	is going to be doing?
4193020	4197180	Charging me more microtransactions for luminous backgrounds.
4197180	4199300	Actually no, it's what they're already doing.
4199300	4205660	They're already in work on a successor to the Xbox 360.
4205660	4216380	Basically Chris Lewis, who is the EMEA for Microsoft, their VP, sorry, has been quoted
4216380	4221460	saying you can't sit back on your laurels in this business, the consumer won't let you,
4221460	4224820	the developer certainly won't let us, so that's happening now.
4224820	4233120	They said there's not anything they can really say on it right now, of course, but it's still
4233120	4237260	very, very early on.
4237260	4238660	So they're thinking ahead.
4238660	4239660	This isn't a surprise.
4239660	4243280	I mean, Xbox 360 was being worked on years in advance.
4243280	4246340	Just because they're laying down the preliminary groundwork does not mean the 360 is dead.
4246340	4247340	By any means.
4247340	4248740	These things take years to happen.
4248740	4252580	I think it's getting blown out of proportion a little bit by some of the gaming media out
4252580	4254180	there.
4254180	4261340	Guess what, folks, Sony is probably working on a PlayStation 4 and Nintendo is doing a
4261340	4266140	Wii again or whatever they're going to call it, I mean, more Wii 2.
4266140	4269940	Who remembers the Neptune?
4269940	4272860	How long did that take to eventually become the Dreamcast?
4272860	4275100	Oh, the dolphin, huh?
4275100	4277100	Yeah, I gotcha.
4277100	4278100	Alright.
4278100	4284420	Yeah, hopefully they'll, you know, maybe they'll pick a cool development name and stick to
4284420	4285420	it.
4285420	4287820	Remember how disappointed people were when Nintendo dropped that name Revolution and
4287820	4288820	went with Wii?
4288820	4290340	Although I think people are used to it now.
4290340	4293620	You know, I think people got the sand out of their vagina now over that whole naming
4293620	4294620	of the Wii.
4294620	4295620	I told you.
4295620	4296620	Revolution was a cool name.
4296620	4297620	Wasn't I right?
4297620	4298620	Simplicity.
4298620	4299620	Easy to remember.
4299620	4300620	Something people will talk about.
4300620	4301940	Well, we'll see when the damn thing goes on sale.
4301940	4305540	Besides, they need to save Revolution in case they come up with something really, really
4305540	4309180	cool like, you know, 3D holographic projection or something like that.
4309180	4310180	They tried that.
4310180	4311900	It was a game called Time Stalker.
4311900	4315100	Which was the big reveal on this show that Nintendo was supposedly putting in the Wii
4315100	4316100	console.
4316100	4317940	Yeah, but you know what?
4317940	4321900	Somebody is still working on it apparently because that was still a quote that one of
4321900	4327220	the game companies out there had the technology to do it, so, you know, unless PlayStation
4327220	4331700	3 is doing that, which I don't think so, but, you know, whatever.
4331700	4334180	I guess that would justify the cost.
4334180	4342860	All right, well, when I said something about Microsoft charging on Xbox Live for little
4342860	4345100	bits and pieces here and there, I wasn't joking, folks.
4345100	4348500	Now, to be fair, it's not really Microsoft that sets up these fees.
4348500	4349500	It is the developers.
4349500	4352220	Well, wait until you hear this one.
4352220	4358500	Electronic Arts is selling Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007 cheats on Xbox Live.
4358500	4364540	In other words, you could just download for 200 points, unlock golfer, and unlock courses.
4364540	4365660	That's 200 each.
4365660	4369460	And you will open up all the hidden golfers and courses in the game.
4369460	4372220	Don't even have to think about, oh, I've got to play through and do this.
4372220	4375260	I've got to play through and do that to unlock it.
4375260	4378700	So you can still play through the game the old-fashioned way and not have to pay the
4378700	4379700	points.
4379700	4382820	But if you just want to unlock everything right at the start, just like that, pay 200
4382820	4384620	points for a simple unlock key.
4384620	4386620	Good idea, bad idea.
4386620	4388620	Why?
4388620	4397180	Because it takes, why hands, actually it's more of a reflection on the society.
4397180	4403660	So I don't want to say necessarily bad idea, just a sad idea that people are so wanton
4403660	4409900	to instant gratification, wanton it now that they can't freaking work for something.
4409900	4411420	That pisses me off.
4411420	4414620	But Jamie, I have to have this course.
4414620	4417540	My friends are coming over tonight for a Tiger Woods tournament.
4417540	4419580	I have to play this course.
4419580	4423500	I suggest you start playing the hell out of it now.
4423500	4427900	Sit your ass down in that chair and play your goddamn golf.
4427900	4429580	Loki, any thoughts?
4429580	4430580	Good idea, bad idea.
4430580	4435680	I think it's dumb just because, I mean, I guess whether they're trying to make sure
4435680	4439060	that when the next Tiger Woods game comes out, which is just going to have more courses
4439060	4443860	anyways and probably not be very different, that you'll be finished with this one because
4443860	4447460	you'll probably have already cheated by then or finished the game.
4447460	4451180	Is this a way for them to say, F you, game facts, F you, strategy guides.
4451180	4453100	Well, they tried the same thing before.
4453100	4459820	They had EA put out Madden NFL tutorial videos for some of the basic stuff and they were
4459820	4466220	selling them online on Xbox Live Marketplace, stuff that should have probably been included
4466220	4468220	in the game, like how to throw a pass.
4468220	4471640	Yeah, that might be useful when I play the game.
4471640	4476180	Jeremy Todd one in chat says, breaking news, they're going to add drivable golf carts in
4476180	4479220	Tiger Woods 2008 and you'll have to pay for the steering wheel so that you'll be able
4479220	4480660	to drive the golf cart.
4480660	4484440	I would love to drive golf carts in Tiger Woods and run over people.
4484440	4487300	That would sell the game for me.
4487300	4495260	All right, well, that's just about it for the gaming news tonight, but it's not it for
4495260	4499460	everything we've got to say because you know Dark Soccer, she has to surf the web up and
4499460	4505140	down and left and right every single week and find a site for your viewing pleasure
4505140	4508420	and it's featured here in the website of the week.
4508420	4514740	Dark Soccer, where should the kids be pointing their browsers right now?
4514740	4521060	I would suggest the site of false advertising, a gallery of parody.
4521060	4534460	It's at parody.organiq.com and it's got lots of neat little false ads basically, you just
4534460	4539900	scroll through the site and it's basically like one of them is star sucks coffee, drink
4539900	4546620	our coffee or we'll break your legs and radio shit, you've got money, we've got pockets.
4546620	4549660	So for those folks that like, you know, funny ha ha parody ads.
4549660	4554660	My favorite one on here is like the fourth one in, it's an ad for Prozac, it says you'd
4554660	4557100	kill them without it, it shows a picture of a family.
4557100	4560340	Do they have a parody ad of the whole, you remember it was controversial about two months
4560340	4564540	ago, they had the white PSP ads, do we have any parodies of that?
4564540	4569620	No, I haven't seen any so far, I've seen Calvin Clone dare to be the same.
4569620	4571700	Get working on that folks.
4571700	4577060	And Baby Gasp, next week I'll outgrow this, it's pretty funny.
4577060	4581820	Check it out boys and girls, Dark Soccer's website of the week.
4581820	4585900	One other thing we've been featuring here pretty weekly here on Orange Lounge Radio
4585900	4588340	are DDR previews.
4588340	4594220	We've been previewing new tracks of DDR games upcoming on the Xbox and Xbox 360 systems
4594220	4599180	and guys you know what, next week is the last week for this, cry, sob, well that's right
4599180	4600860	the games will be out soon enough.
4600860	4605820	We still have more songs soon enough, well I guess after what you've learned tonight
4605820	4610700	maybe not that soon for Universe, but we do know that Ultramix 4 is coming, so at least
4610700	4613520	we can give you a little taste of what you can expect in March, that's alright, March
4613520	4615100	is a slow period anyway.
4615100	4616100	Who releases games today?
4616100	4617100	March is actually pretty heavy.
4617100	4618100	Is it?
4618100	4619100	Yeah.
4619100	4620100	I thought it was April.
4620100	4621100	April got heavier.
4621100	4622100	No, April starts to die down again.
4622100	4625080	March is like the end of fiscal quarter months.
4625080	4628140	Well then I obviously don't know what I'm talking about so let's get to the music.
4628140	4632900	We have two new tracks tonight from DDR Ultramix 4 and two new tracks from DDR Universe, let's
4632900	4637180	start it off with a track from DDR Ultramix 4, no long versions tonight folks, sorry to
4637180	4639180	say, just have some short tracks for you guys.
4639180	4643940	This first song is from DDR Ultramix 4, it's by a group called Neuroactive and the song
4643940	4648540	is called More Serotonin, enjoy it here on the sneak peaks.
4648540	4678060	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one.
4678060	4701740	Bye!
4738060	4745060	I was neuroactive with more serotonin here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.
4745060	4751500	I caught myself doing the little head bob thing, Night at a Roxbury, during that song.
4751500	4753260	For a dancy-trancy song, not bad.
4753260	4754260	I like that.
4754260	4756660	This is a good edit.
4756660	4762120	If dancy-trancy isn't your thing, remember that these games keep a variety of music.
4762120	4766780	This one is definitely a unique sounding song, this next song we have coming up.
4766780	4767780	It's very interesting.
4767780	4768780	It's interesting.
4768780	4775300	It looked like someone cut a really stinky fart.
4775300	4777100	No, it's just different.
4777100	4779820	It was not what I expected when I first heard this song.
4779820	4782280	You guys see if maybe it's more your thing?
4782280	4787620	It's by Wave Group, featuring Scotty D. They did that Stompin' at the Gotham song last
4787620	4790500	week, which was awesome, that jazzy one we all liked.
4790500	4791500	See if you like this one.
4791500	4794780	It's called Bongo, here on the Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.
4794780	4795780	Bongo.
4795780	4796780	Hear that?
4796780	4805900	It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.
4805900	4813900	It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.
4813900	4836700	It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.
4836700	4857900	It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.
4857900	4882860	It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.
4882860	4896380	Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.
4896380	4902220	That is Bongo, by Wave Group, featuring Scotty D, coming soon to DDR Universe.
4902220	4903220	See what I'm telling you?
4903220	4904220	It's a little different.
4904220	4905220	That song is growing on me.
4905220	4910300	I like the whole Austin Powers 60's spy theme vibe that song has going.
4910300	4914060	I think, with all due respect to the folks that wrote that and sang it, I think it's
4914060	4916100	the voiceovers that kind of bugged me a little bit.
4916100	4917100	I don't know.
4917100	4921100	It's a little weird and out of place to me, but it'll probably be...
4921100	4924740	Songs sound different when you're just listening to them than when you do when you're actually
4924740	4928180	playing them and dancing to them when they're coming out of your TV, so I'm sure I won't
4928180	4929180	even notice.
4929180	4930180	All right.
4930180	4933840	Let's go to a song from DDR UltraMix 4, and this one's pretty exciting.
4933840	4936540	This is by a group called Real Life.
4936540	4939860	You might remember, years ago in the 80's, they did that song Send Me an Angel, and they
4939860	4943140	would still play it in clubs around the nation, right?
4943140	4948580	So they have a song in DDR UltraMix 4, it's called Oblivion, and it was remixed by Nevaraka,
4948580	4951460	who did some of the other remixes in previous UltraMix games.
4951460	4956180	I didn't realize that they sung the original of that.
4956180	4958540	I have the Nevaraka mix, I just need to listen to the original.
4958540	4959540	There it is.
4959540	4975860	Real Life with Oblivion here on Orange Launch Radio, sneak peeks.
4975860	4997700	We are in my heart, I am running out of the truth.
4997700	5008700	I'm running out of the truth Whatever I do I never want to hurt you
5008700	5015700	When it comes to this I feel fine but I have to admit
5015700	5021700	Here in my heart I'm running out of the truth
5021700	5034700	Life goes on and the world turns round Yeah, life goes on and the world turns round
5034700	5061700	Cynthia, bring it on Cynthia, bring it on
5064700	5074700	I'm running out of the truth
5074700	5099700	I'm running out of the truth
5099700	5104700	Let's enjoy!
5129700	5138700	I'm running out of the truth
5138700	5167700	I'm running out of the truth
5167700	5191700	I'm running out of the truth
