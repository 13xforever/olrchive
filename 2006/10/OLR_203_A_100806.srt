00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Today, October 8th, 2006, rumors about next-gen sales at GameStop fly around the Internet,

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:32,760
angry NBA Live fans write a letter to EA, and a popular BS mascot moves to the PSP.

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Hello everybody out there on the Internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Radio.

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,800
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,960
My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,200
Joining me, not tonight, is Dark Sakura.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,560
She actually has the night off.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,400
Unfortunately, she had a funeral she had to go to today, so we hope all is well with her

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,840
and her family.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
We do have, though, tonight, Loki joining us.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Tech master Loki.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,640
Yes, and I'm wiping the salt off of this laptop here.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,320
Were you having a late-night snack just before, I shouldn't say late-night, I guess more late-afternoon

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,520
snack before starting the show here?

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
Yes, McDonald's french fries.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,640
That would definitely be salty.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,040
That would be.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm sure it's going to be an interesting program tonight as it is just Loki and just myself

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
here in studio.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,360
We have no third guest, no Miklotov, no Drew Nami, no other people really were available

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
tonight.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,680
As somebody had suggested, we could do a third co-host through Skype, but I don't know.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,840
There's something about you sitting here in studio and Jamie when she's here sitting in

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
the studio.

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Somebody suggested that was a stupid idea.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,880
Well, no, I don't know.

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,040
It might be something to try in the future, but just for right now, it's a little difficult.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,580
You can't get that same.

31
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,000
For me, I know there's a lot of shows, podcasts out there that do the Skype co-host thing,

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
and if it works for your show, awesome.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,840
That's a great way to get a variety of opinions, but this is just the way we've been doing

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,480
it for four years, and in the nine years I've been doing radio, I've never had a co-host

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
who wasn't in the studio.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,280
I'll just start answering you with a ten-second delay.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,400
How about that?

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,360
I guess if the person you're co-hosting with on Skype has a good connection, it's not so

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
bad, but we'll see.

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,840
We have some pretty good connections with our callers, and we will be hearing from them

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
a little later on in the program.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,120
Of course, our chat room, always the ever-present, tonight, third guest, usually it's the fourth

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
guest, but tonight they're the third guest.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
They get promoted.

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,360
I guess our chat room is the co-host substitute tonight, so if you want to join our chat room

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,400
and you are listening live here on Sunday night, head on over to www.orangelaunchradio.com

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
and click on Chat.

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,160
All right, let's get into games and start it off, Loki, talking about how was your gaming

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
week?

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
My gaming week was great.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,920
I played a lot of Saints Row, and I finally got the 20-hour achievement for that game.

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,640
It's fun, and there's actually a whole section of the game I really hadn't explored yet.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,760
It's just a really fun game, so I've been playing that, actually playing through some

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,040
of the storyline.

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,040
It's one of those games that you are allowed to cheat in it, but you can't get achievement

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,720
points doing it, so it feels good to actually play through the game, and to be honest, the

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,440
game's not that hard anyways, at least not the part that I'm at.

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
So I don't know, it's pretty fun.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,320
And the storyline, I like the storyline so far to it, so yeah, it's worth checking out.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,240
Other than that, I've been actually, well, I've been trying to play some PlayStation

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,040
2 games, but that didn't happen this week.

62
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,960
I have them all lined up to play next week.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,240
Even games I shouldn't be having to play next week, I will be playing next week.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,960
I see, okay.

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,640
But yeah, so lots of good stuff.

66
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,040
There's a lot of people out there that develop games that really leak stuff to the internet

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,540
pretty early, so.

68
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,680
And then, of course, just the usual, real quick comment from the chatroom, joshi16 says

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,120
the ending to Saints sucks.

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,680
Have you gotten that far where you saw the ending?

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,080
No, but I don't care.

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
So what if the ending sucks?

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Big deal.

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,600
I mean, if your main character doesn't talk, so how great can it be?

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,080
I mean, it's just, they should have him do a monologue, that'd be hilarious, because

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
he's just standing there going, doo doo doo.

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,160
You know, a lot of video game endings suck now that I think about it.

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,040
It's like Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto's ending sucked, and you beat it so you can

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,840
have lots of rockets at your crib, so you can go blow up shit.

80
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,800
That's what I did today, I was, you know, playing, and I blew up cop cars and stuff,

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,280
and then I got on the train tracks, and I blew up the L train, and the train fell down,

82
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,760
and usually you can't jump off the tracks without dying, but since there's a big train

83
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,940
pile up next to the tracks, I just jumped on the trains and ran down, and it's fun.

84
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,440
It's fun running around hitting people.

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,280
I am looking for, though, because there is an exploit in the game where if you find an

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,960
armored car, you can actually take it back to your, you know, crib or whatever, and store

87
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,540
it in your garage, and once you've stored a car in your garage, you basically can respawn

88
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,120
the car numerous times.

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,320
Well, the one armored car has money in it, so you respawn it, blow it up, respawn it,

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,720
blow it up, and you keep taking the money out of it, so it's a little bit of an exploit,

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,760
but not technically cheating, because you're playing with the game's physics.

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,200
If that's their mistake, that's fine.

93
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,720
That's why the whole duping glitch in Oblivion, not really cheating, because it was there.

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I did not put a code in.

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,400
And now the chat room is talking about video game endings, right?

96
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,360
And Jeremy Todd once says, who cares if the ending sucks, if the whole other part of the

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
game is good, who gives a shit about the ending?

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,000
And Joshi16 kind of seems to follow up with that, with saying in response to his comment

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
earlier, I was just saying, I still like the game.

100
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
So what if the ending sucked, huh?

101
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,200
You know what, and if the ending sucks, you just continue playing in multiplayer.

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,840
And then of course SmartAss starts its mouth off in the chat room here.

103
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Where is it?

104
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,960
Oh, Joshi16 says the ending to Pac-Man sucks also.

105
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Didn't I just restart?

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,440
No, you get a half-board at the very end.

107
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
You can actually look it up.

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,480
I was on a Wikipedia marathon this week, reading about different video games on Wikipedia,

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,400
and one of them I was reading about was Pac-Man, and they actually have a screenshot of the

110
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,480
256th or 255th board, the one that crashes out the machine, and it's only like a half-board.

111
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,600
It's funky looking.

112
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Look it up on Wikipedia.

113
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,840
You shouldn't be playing that game that long anyways.

114
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,140
That is a long time to be playing one game.

115
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,640
I played Pac-Man this week though, because I just wanted to, I guess.

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
I don't know.

117
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Okay, and I tried playing Totem Ball, and to be honest, I mean, this isn't a huge surprise

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,880
to me, because at E3 when I played Totem Ball, it sucked ass because you had people walking

119
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,380
behind you and it just cannot pick up your movements.

120
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,600
The main thing that comes down to these stupid games that use the camera for movement, like

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,440
the eye toy, is that in your typical gaming environment, you do not have a giant white

122
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,720
screen behind you to move in front of.

123
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,520
So I don't know what the fuck environment they test this stuff in, which I'm assuming

124
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,040
has a giant white screen behind them, but that does not work in the real world, so stop

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,720
making games that don't work in the real world in just a lab environment, because to be honest,

126
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,320
I can't get this game to work at all, and it's just, it's really sad because my room,

127
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,680
I mean, it's lit well enough I would believe, but I guess not.

128
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,280
So I don't want to have to make special lighting arrangements just to be able to play this

129
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,800
game, and to be honest, the game doesn't look that fun, so whatever, it's free, so I don't

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,280
feel like I wasted any money, but I'm not going to be buying any sort of eye toy play

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,920
compilations down the road for this vision camera, so I don't know.

132
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,740
I think it's kind of dumb.

133
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,200
But then I played Zuma a little bit, because Nelly was hogging it and playing lots of Zuma,

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,040
and then I don't know, I just tried to kind of mix it up a bit with the Xbox Live Arcade

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
games.

136
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
All right.

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Very cool.

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,840
I also played Totem Ball this week, because I got an Xbox Live camera earlier this week,

139
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,800
so I'm finally there and using that online, and I'll tell you the things I like about

140
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,440
the camera, and I'll tell you things I don't like about the camera.

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,040
The things I like about the camera is being able to take your own picture, making your

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,360
own game or card picture, and having the cool little effects with it.

143
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I think I have a good one now.

144
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Yeah, you have a pretty good one.

145
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,240
I took a very emo picture and did this effect on it.

146
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,040
I wish I could copy it to my MySpace, it would be perfect.

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Actually, I'm not sure if you can pull them up, you might be able to pull them up on the

148
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Xbox website.

149
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
No, you can't.

150
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,800
It'll show, you know how you have the one that your friends can see, that's your gamer

151
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,400
picture that you took of the camera?

152
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,780
We also have to set the one for what your non-friends see, and that's the one that shows

153
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
up on Xbox.com.

154
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
That's lame.

155
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,400
So I still have the Doom guy as my icon.

156
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,040
But the other things I like about the camera is video chat is actually really smooth, and

157
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,880
pretty good looking for the camera, provided you don't get a defective one, like Logie

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
had at first.

159
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,340
I think video chat's pretty awesome, and it's fast, and it's pretty clear.

160
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,480
Some listener I was video chatting with tonight, and they didn't have a camera, so I couldn't

161
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,240
see theirs, but they said that I looked really good, and of course I always look good.

162
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,680
But then we were video chatting earlier in the week, Logie, and it was really smooth,

163
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
and plus I made your controller vibrate a lot, for no good reason, just because I could

164
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
actually.

165
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,360
Well, then we'll have to video chat later on tonight and I'll just hold down the R button

166
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
and shake it up.

167
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Yeah, that's stupid.

168
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Give it to your wife.

169
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,560
She'll enjoy that.

170
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,320
The things I don't like about the camera is totem ball.

171
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,280
Sorry, if you're going to get a camera just so you can play totem ball because it's free

172
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,160
on Xbox Live Arcade, not a selling point for the system, I'm sorry to say, and it basically

173
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,200
boils down to, I mean, the game is an interesting concept, and it seems to be done pretty well

174
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,240
in the graphical sense and all that stuff, but the controls stink.

175
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,840
Controlling it with my hands is no fun at all.

176
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,400
It's fun for about two minutes, and I do have a white wall in this house.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,980
I do have a white background pretty much that I'm playing against.

178
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,040
The lighting is sometimes screwy because the light's coming in from the side, but even

179
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,880
then I didn't have a whole lot of problems with iToy, but this game, I just can't control

180
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
it the way I want it to.

181
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
It's not that great.

182
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,400
And to be honest, I think it'd be cool if they didn't update to it where you can use

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,000
the controller because I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard to program that in, but I mean

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,040
that would be nice because the game looks kind of fun.

185
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,520
It might be fun to play, you know, kind of like a marble blast type of game, but it's

186
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
not very fun.

187
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,240
I cannot get the damn thing to work, and it's frustrating, and after about two minutes playing

188
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,000
this thing, I'm like, fuck this, I'll go play something else.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,480
And to be honest, if I paid for that, I'd be pissed off, and thank God they didn't,

190
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
you know.

191
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,640
They had the extra development time that they had because this game, you know, did come

192
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,320
out a couple weeks after the camera, you know, that they would get it right, but apparently

193
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,400
no, they didn't, so whatever, I guess they were like, fuck it, who cares, it's free.

194
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,680
I'll say this, I did enjoy the pinball minigame that comes with it quite a bit where you use

195
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
your hands as the flippers.

196
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,320
I mean, it's kind of just like a one gimmick thing, but the pinball game did not frustrate

197
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,080
me nearly as much as the actual game itself trying to control around, but the pinball

198
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,840
one's easy because you just wave your right hand and it moves the right flipper, you wave

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,280
your left hand and it moves the left flipper, and that was more entertaining for me than

200
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,560
the actual game game that was there, so.

201
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,080
I haven't tried the pinball yet.

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,560
It doesn't look like totem ball is too popular amongst my friends too, like, I got three

203
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,040
really easy achievements that aren't hard to get, and I think I have the highest gamer

204
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,840
score on totem ball if anybody on my friends list, and about, I have about 70 people on

205
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,820
my friends list, and about 10 or 15 of them have the camera, and you know, you know what

206
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,640
game I actually did play, and I, you know, because I know it supports the camera, was

207
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,040
Bank Shot Billiards 2.

208
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
How was that?

209
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,720
You know, it's interesting, I thought there was some 3D support where you can change the

210
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,520
camera angle or something.

211
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,760
I could not find that option whatsoever, so if it's there, it's hidden to me, because

212
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't see it, but I did play it.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,920
There was one achievement where you sink the nine ball in on a game of nine ball in the

214
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,640
first break, and I got that the first try, so that wasn't too hard, but the game, the

215
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,060
computer's fucking hard.

216
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,200
Luckily though, you can't adjust the computer difficulty, but it's pretty fun for a billiards

217
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,160
game, you can actually, you have pretty good control over it, so I like it.

218
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
Worth 15 bucks?

219
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,760
No, but luckily I got that with my live kit, my one year live kit, it came with it, so

220
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,960
I wouldn't pay $15 for that thing, that thing may be five bucks, but I don't know.

221
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Gotcha.

222
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,200
Let's see, I wanted to mention some chat comments here, there's a lot of them going on here,

223
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,240
mostly a lot of people sharing about their gaming week, let's see, I feel bad I can't

224
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,600
pronounce this name, Tacte Poire, I think that is, says totem ball wasn't free, you

225
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,120
paid for it with the camera, I guess essentially you can kind of look at it that way, let's

226
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,680
see, and Ravens Dolphin says along the same lines, yes guy, it is free, you can't complain,

227
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,760
talking about totem ball, so whatever.

228
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,440
I didn't understand though that they threw in there with the 12 month camera bundle,

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,340
which is the one I ended up getting, because I got to swap it out at Gamestop, they only

230
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,900
have the gear bundle left, so some idiot employee gave it to me at equal cost, so I got a free

231
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:16,360
year of live for, well, free actually, so that was interesting, but it came with Robotron,

232
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,880
you know, and I already own Robotron, but that's the dumbest, I don't, why would you

233
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,360
throw that in there, it doesn't even support the camera, I mean, I just don't get that

234
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
at all.

235
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,680
For the live element, being able to play on live, it's a cheap little game that they can,

236
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
you know, demonstrate the live.

237
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Put in like, I don't know, like hardwood hearts or something, you know one of the other games

238
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,120
that supports the camera, I would think that they would want camera supported games with

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,600
the camera, I don't know.

240
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,880
Alright, let's see what else I do with my gaming week, actually not a whole lot else,

241
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,960
it's pretty much the only new game I played, yeah, I'm rocking my brain here, I can't think

242
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,760
of anything else really new, oh, I'll think of one I played, I went back, because of all

243
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,560
the love I was giving to this game recently on the show, I went back and found a copy

244
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,840
of Civilization 1, and I got it running on the computer, and I took over the world once

245
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,360
this week, it was fun.

246
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
That's excellent.

247
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,040
That's one of my favorite games of all time right there, I almost bought Civ 4 for the

248
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,180
PC, but I needed to have a price drop first, because those Civ games always drop in price

249
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,560
later on, so I'm waiting for that.

250
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,760
Well, I was playing also Cookie Mama.

251
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
How was Cookie Mama?

252
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,440
It was actually pretty fun, I figured out how to play the game now, so it works pretty

253
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,360
well for me, and it's just like a warrior type of game, it's basically a bunch of mini

254
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,880
games and you cook something, and some are very easy, some are very hard, some will frustrate

255
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,240
the hell out of you because it's just not sensitive enough, or what the case may be,

256
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,440
but I don't know, it's kind of fun, I think you might get bored with it after a while

257
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,000
though, but yeah, that's a really tough thing about the DS games, it's a lot of them, they

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,200
have a really short attention span for me, it's not anything I can go back and play and

259
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,680
play and play over and over again, like for example, Grand Theft Auto, I can go back and

260
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,080
play that anytime, and it's still interesting to me, I don't know.

261
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,240
Alright, well that's it for my gaming week, anything else for you?

262
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,520
I believe that's all I had.

263
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,880
Alright, now the chat room was asking us about this, and since we don't have Jamie here tonight

264
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,520
and the segment's a little bit shorter because of it, we got a little time to talk about

265
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,240
this.

266
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,080
Video gaming showed up in a couple shows this week, and of course, one that was very well

267
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,240
known that a lot of people saw was the South Park episode with World of Warcraft, what

268
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
did you think?

269
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
What did you think of the South Park episode with World of Warcraft?

270
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,160
That was pretty funny, and I probably didn't get a lot of the humor in it because I don't

271
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,320
play World of Warcraft, but it was still funny though, it was hilarious.

272
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,480
I thought it was really well done, but I don't know, for me, I just kind of wish, I don't

273
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,320
know, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge South Park fan and I love the movie, it's one of

274
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,880
my favorite movies ever and I love a lot of the other stuff they do, but this episode

275
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,640
for me, it just wasn't that same satire that I like out of the other stuff.

276
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,800
I don't know, I think the problem was just the plot, I just didn't really like the plot,

277
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,920
it seemed a little, I don't know, I just kind of wish they could have, I think I read a

278
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,740
comment on one of the gaming sites where other people talk about this, where maybe Cartman

279
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,680
could have been running a string of Chinese gold farmers or something, that would have

280
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,880
been funny.

281
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:19,200
I don't know, it was a little cheesy, but they did a very good job integrating the game

282
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,040
with the show, but because of that, it kind of felt like an infomercial to me.

283
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,200
It felt more like an infomercial, unless it's satire.

284
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,040
Or even better, here's a better description of it, it felt like someone making a machima

285
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,120
of the World of Warcraft game set to the audio track of South Park.

286
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,280
It's like if you were to take a classic episode and just kind of make a machima from it.

287
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,760
And of course, the funniest part of the whole show was, mom, bathroom, bathroom.

288
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,560
But my mind's in the gutter like that, that made me laugh really hard.

289
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,100
And a lot of people, some people are bitching about, oh, the Horde wasn't in it, or oh,

290
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,720
their characters weren't the right levels, and if you're probably complaining about these

291
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,520
types of things, you're probably exactly who these guys were trying to make satire out

292
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
of.

293
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Any time you're going to incorporate a game into a TV show, it ain't going to be perfect.

294
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,920
Well, I bet you anything they're trying to do that on purpose.

295
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,320
Probably, and I think all things considered, they did a pretty decent job.

296
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,000
I think, yeah, it would have been nice to see a Horde character in there, because I

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
play a Horde character myself, but at the same time, the more I think about it, the

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,360
more I go, you're starting to look like that fat guy at the computer with the drool and

299
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,640
the chip on his shirt, so I stopped thinking about it.

300
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,360
It's going to be the end of the world of Warcraft.

301
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,760
Did you see The Office with the Call of Duty 2 references?

302
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,880
I saw the clip of it.

303
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,040
I saw like half of it.

304
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,400
I didn't see the whole episode, but I saw like half of it, and it seemed to get it pretty

305
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
well.

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
The Office is funny.

307
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,200
I have to admit, though, I'm a big fan of the British Office, and I watched that whole

308
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,200
one before the American one showed up, and so it's always weird for me to watch the American

309
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,240
episodes of The Office, but it seems like they did a good job making satire a Call of

310
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Duty.

311
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,760
I watched season one and two of The Office, and I just started watching it last night.

312
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
I don't have to borrow them.

313
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,320
They're just different shows, except for the very, very first episode, it was the same

314
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,940
plot in the British one and the American one.

315
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,200
We got up through the second episode, which is Diversity Day.

316
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Yeah, yeah.

317
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
That's always funny.

318
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
All right.

319
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,800
No, you know, I appreciate that the chat room is going to link me to a torrent of The Office,

320
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,320
but I still have it on the DVR.

321
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm just being lazy when it comes to watching it, so I will watch the whole thing.

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,280
You know what I'm very disappointed about?

323
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,800
I didn't even realize they had started a new season of it yet, drawing together.

324
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
There was a new season.

325
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
It was horrible.

326
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I watched the season premiere, and it was horrible.

327
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
It was horrible.

328
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,240
I didn't find it funny at all.

330
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
I don't know.

331
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,000
That's another show I really like that had really weird scenes.

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It was pretty funny.

333
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know.

334
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
All right.

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Anyway, now we're turning into TV talk, so we better get back to, I mean, a lot of nerds

336
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,200
like their TV.

337
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,240
They have a link type character in it.

338
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,360
I mean, it's game related a little bit, so whatever.

339
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
All right.

340
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

341
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
We don't have a whole lot tonight.

342
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,840
Obviously, Jamie will be back this week.

343
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
She's out this week.

344
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,880
The DVR previews are continuing tonight.

345
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,280
You'll hear those a little later in this segment.

346
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,440
I want to give a quick shout out to one of our listeners who's in chat tonight, El Mullet,

347
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,440
who hasn't been there for a long, long time, but he says he wanted to come to chat tonight

348
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,120
because he's getting married next week, so he's getting married next Sunday, so he wanted

349
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,920
to have his, I guess, a good last Sunday night hurrah of single life here in the chat room,

350
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
so I appreciate that.

351
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I'm wearing the shirt.

352
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
You are.

353
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Loki's wearing the shirt we bought him.

354
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Jamie and I got him a shirt before he got married.

355
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
It says, Game Over, with the husband frowning and the wife smiling.

356
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
It's great.

357
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
You've probably seen it on the internet, other places.

358
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
It's at Target.

359
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Yeah.

360
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
A lot of people have it, but that's cool.

361
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,000
All right.

362
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
Anyway.

363
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,560
Any advice for the gamer about to cross into married life?

364
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:56,680
Hopefully your wife-to-be likes games, otherwise you'll be playing a lot less games.

365
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,320
My suggestion is find something that she likes to do.

366
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,520
My wife is totally jaded on games.

367
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,600
She says, yet she plays Zuma.

368
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,680
I seriously think she's played the 360 more than me this week, and I'm not kidding.

369
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,640
It's like crack to her.

370
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,480
She gets so frustrated if she can't beat certain levels, and she's stuck on level six right

371
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,400
now, and it's just, oh man, she'll be just sitting there for hours, and I'm just like,

372
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,640
can I play Saints Row, and she's like, I'm playing Zuma.

373
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
And just so you know, Elle Mullet, we have the stripper coming soon for the chat room

374
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,960
bachelor party.

375
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,920
DMN, go ahead and start taking it off.

376
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Just kidding.

377
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
All right.

378
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Let's get into this gaming news, for real.

379
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
All right.

380
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,160
So anyways, this week was a whole bunch of Wii news rumors, et cetera, and of course

381
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,800
a lot of them were kind of based around GameStop, and especially since GameStop had their wonderful

382
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,320
annual sales conference in Dallas, lots of information leaking out of there, and of course

383
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,360
lots of secondhand accounts and stuff.

384
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,680
So we don't know how much of this is true, but we're reporting it to you anyways.

385
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,400
One big thing, though, coming out of it was that GameStop said at the show that they would

386
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:16,160
be the only retail at launch to have Wii demonstration units available in their stores.

387
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,520
And so basically you can go test out the game systems as well.

388
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,680
I don't know if that's entirely true, but maybe at launch, yeah.

389
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,840
Maybe they might be a little bit later to get them to other stores, but I don't know.

390
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,380
You know what I was thinking about with this whole thing, with the GameStop having the

391
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,200
exclusive Wii?

392
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,400
You know, this actually may have some truth in my mind, whereas I think some of the other

393
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
rumors we're going to get to are a bunch of poopy.

394
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,040
I think the interesting thing about this, remember when you came on and you did your

395
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,240
episode 198 report, the big one that was really controversial, where you had all these, you

396
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,400
know, things you were talking about, you know, all this upcoming news, and one of the things

397
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,300
you said is that there's not going to be any demo kiosks for the Wii.

398
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,560
They told us that they're not doing demo kiosks for the Wii.

399
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,000
But almost that exact same day, pictures were being posted on the internet elsewhere from

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,960
these GameStop EB people that had pictures of the Wii demo unit that was coming in.

401
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,480
But now that this story has come out, I kind of go, this could make both reports accurate,

402
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,440
where of course you guys were told there's not going to be any kiosks because you're

403
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
not getting any.

404
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
They're all going to GameStop.

405
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,320
And here's the other thing too, our sales rep or whatever from Nintendo deals with only

406
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,800
a certain region, maybe say the West Coast or whatever.

407
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,400
He doesn't deal with, you know, GameStop, you know, which would be the Dallas area.

408
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,800
So where his information might be that there are no kiosks, you know, someone else that

409
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,080
works for Nintendo, yeah, there are kiosks because they're going to GameStop.

410
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
So kind of interesting.

411
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
It makes sense.

412
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,880
Because I think about that, and I think about trying to put all that together, because I

413
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,560
don't think the reps that were talking to you were full of BS.

414
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,280
I know you're not full of BS, despite what other people on the internet might think.

415
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
It kind of adds up for me that this could be true.

416
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,880
And the thing, I think the thing, the major difficulty with having a GameStop kiosk, or

417
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,680
not a GameStop kiosk, but a Wii kiosk is that the controllers don't have a wired version.

418
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,920
There's no one that you can just kind of tie down.

419
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,160
And I mean, sure, you could probably, you know, put some, you know, steel cable on there

420
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
or something like that.

421
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,400
Yeah, I don't think it'd be that hard to put a steel cable on.

422
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
But I mean, still, it's going to look kind of funky.

423
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Or put a sensor on the back so when someone tries to walk out the door with it, beep,

424
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
beep, beep, beep.

425
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That won't stop anybody.

426
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't know.

427
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That would come off so easy.

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But anyway.

429
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's an idea.

430
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Geez.

431
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The other news that came out actually.

432
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,680
I want to ask real quick though, what about now, the thing that makes me think this may

433
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,880
not be true is that there was this story earlier about Wal-Mart said that they weren't going

434
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,120
to be doing it or whatever.

435
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,200
And I'm thinking, well, when was Wal-Mart given an option if it's exclusive to GameStop,

436
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
right?

437
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Well, who knows?

438
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I mean, I don't know.

439
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I don't know.

440
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
So take it with a grain of salt.

441
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,700
Maybe, okay, well, let me put it this way.

442
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,020
Maybe they weren't the only ones that were going to be exclusive.

443
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,760
Maybe it was going to be GameStop and Wal-Mart and maybe a few other retailers.

444
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,600
But the retailer said, hey, we don't want this demo unit because we're afraid that

445
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
people are going to get hurt.

446
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,000
And to be honest, after seeing some of these people try to navigate the self-checkout,

447
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,120
yeah, they will get hurt because they're too dumb to figure it out.

448
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,920
Jeremy Todd 1 says in our chat room, they could just tie a wire where the wrist strap

449
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
goes.

450
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,480
That wouldn't be that hard at all.

451
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Okay.

452
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
That's a perfectly good option.

453
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,200
And then I could just take my X-Acto knife out of my pocket and cut the wrist strap.

454
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,680
Okay, it's not going to be...

455
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,600
Steel cable does not exactly cut with...

456
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

457
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Take out the wrist.

458
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Never mind.

459
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I'm thinking this whole other thing.

460
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Never mind.

461
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,320
And actually, I don't know if that would work either because wrist straps, those little

462
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,320
things on them, the string's pretty thin, so I don't know if you'd be able to stick

463
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
steel cable through.

464
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Ah, whatever.

465
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Whatever.

466
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Okay, let's just say you were able to stick steel cable on there.

467
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,080
Steel people are going to throw them at people and it's just...

468
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
We'll just see what freaking happens when it happens.

469
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
And to be honest...

470
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
We're a month away.

471
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,080
Just because they don't have a kiosk setup, they can set up a kiosk type setup anyways.

472
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,000
I mean, you know, who's to say someone can't just bust one of these things open and just

473
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
create their own?

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,120
So they'll be out there.

475
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Whatever.

476
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,920
Anyways, there's some other news also that GameStop was going to be the first to be...

477
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,520
Or they're going to be selling the Zune in store, so if you have a fascination with the

478
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,080
Microsoft music player, well, there you go.

479
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,520
You can buy it from them.

480
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,040
It's kind of interesting though, because the other mention on this one article is that

481
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,240
this is kind of the first time that they've done this, but if I remember correctly, they

482
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,520
were actually selling Creative Nomads in their store as well.

483
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,560
Maybe not iPods, but they have been selling music playing devices.

484
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,960
Now some of the more unbelievable rumors from the whole GameStop thing, one of them being

485
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,040
that the GameStop Wii kiosk is going to require a credit card to be able to be used.

486
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:53,440
So I imagine with this kind of logic here, probably giving them your license or credit

487
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,080
card so you don't walk out with the Wii controller, maybe so that they don't have to strap them

488
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
down.

489
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,840
I don't know why, when I first read this story, I imagined in my mind having to slide your

490
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,840
credit card through the Wii demo thing, and I'm like, no way!

491
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,380
I would never do that, because they might charge me for something.

492
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,320
So it'll force me to put a pre-order on the Wii, like all that peer pressure they give

493
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,000
you at those stores.

494
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,720
That makes more sense though, it's kind of like playing pool at a bar, you have to give

495
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,480
them your driver's license so you don't walk out with the cue ball.

496
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,460
I guess, but then again, I hope they don't do this, but I guess you have to, because

497
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,340
people walk away with this stuff, so better safe than sorry, I guess.

498
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,400
I still do think overall it's probably a BS story.

499
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,920
JeremyTodd1 in chat brings up a good point, this can't be true!

500
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,240
Nintendo's trying to market to everybody here, so why would they make the kiosk only available

501
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,280
to older people who have a credit card, that's a very good point.

502
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,320
Or driver's license, yeah, seriously.

503
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
I don't think so.

504
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,680
Another story though, coming out of the whole GameStop conference thing, they're saying

505
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:12,700
that basically GameStop, the PS3 pre-orders are based on loyal customers.

506
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,840
Basically from an anonymous tip given to Kotaku from a GameStop manager, each GameStop store

507
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,720
will receive an average of six systems, more for the higher volume stores and less for

508
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
the dead stores.

509
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,200
One of two systems can be given to employees at their store manager's discretion, I don't

510
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,560
think so, but that doesn't sound right at all.

511
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,000
The rest are going to be given out to store regulars.

512
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,480
If a manager feels that he has a customer who is very loyal, shops there often, reserves

513
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,120
many things, they may call them and ask them if they want to guarantee one of the remaining

514
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
four consoles.

515
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,840
Apparently all four of the remaining consoles are handed out in this fashion.

516
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,720
That doesn't even sound right at all.

517
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,940
Not every GameStop will get the same amount of PS3s, I don't think.

518
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,760
It would depend on volume, so that whole, you know, you get four or whatever, no, don't

519
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
buy it.

520
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
That's a crap policy too.

521
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,520
There'd be so much scandal that goes along with that.

522
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
And they're not going to go away.

523
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,400
And to be honest, they're not going to give them to employees at all.

524
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,920
If they're going to get four or six, you know, they're not going to do it.

525
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,400
And I think that kind of goes with other stories that we've had about the reservations.

526
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Right.

527
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,520
I just want to say real quick, by the way, we had an issue in our chat room, if you're

528
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,480
listening live on Sunday, where apparently some folks were not able to get in because

529
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,960
somehow the limit got set on the chat room.

530
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
That's been removed.

531
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I just took it off.

532
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,760
So if you've been trying to join chat and weren't having any luck, try again, you should

533
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
be able to get in now.

534
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,560
And these are chat rooms that full though.

535
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Excellent.

536
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,680
All right.

537
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
So no PS3 preorders from regulars, huh?

538
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Yeah.

539
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
All right.

540
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,440
Well, there might not be any preorders from anyone at all.

541
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,680
1UP is speculating this week that at the annual GameStop conference held last Saturday in

542
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Dallas.

543
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,320
Quote, the great thing is there is a lot of demand, said Steve Morgan, president of GameStop,

544
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,800
but launch is one day.

545
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,420
And really the key to this business is what flows after the launch.

546
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,000
We did learn a lesson last year.

547
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,800
I think the lesson is caution and optimism at the same time.

548
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,480
GameStop's decision not to guarantee your hardware preorder is by no means carved in

549
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
stone.

550
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,400
But from this point, it seems a pretty sure thing from a strictly business point of view.

551
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,440
Last year, GameStop caught some heat after it mistakenly took in more Xbox 360 preorders

552
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
than it had the capacity to fulfill.

553
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
Certainly, that would be correct.

554
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,440
We all remember people were blaming GameStop when they couldn't get their Xbox 360s.

555
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,720
But people were saying what they promised them.

556
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,120
But certainly, they've learned their lesson, it sounds like, and they won't be doing that

557
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,040
again anytime soon.

558
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,840
But the other thing I heard was that that's not exactly true either, that they are going

559
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,560
to be getting some or they're going to be starting taking preorders because this is

560
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,360
basically the point that they made.

561
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Look at Hawaii.

562
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,320
Hawaii's been doing preorders for the PlayStation 3, and we right now are testing that thing

563
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
out.

564
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,480
So yes, they are taking preorders on it, but they're saying that the preorders are probably

565
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,120
not going to start until November.

566
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:16,000
You might start seeing less information about the GameStop stuff circulating the internet.

567
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
A report came in to Gotaku earlier this week that says that basically, the GameStop employees

568
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,760
have been told to shut their mouths.

569
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm a manager at an EB GameStop location, and recently we received this great little

570
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,360
scare notice to pass around the store.

571
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,720
Basically it's been sent in response to all the news about the PS3 Wii preorders, as well

572
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,560
as to scare employees off from buying PS3s and selling them online.

573
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
So interesting.

574
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,560
It was this interesting little cease and desist, and you can read the whole thing if you go

575
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,480
over to Gotaku and you can click and find the whole thing.

576
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,080
But it's basically your typical, you know, we'd like to issue a friendly reminder about

577
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,080
the company policy, blah, blah, blah type thing.

578
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,160
So in other words, yeah, stop coming on the internet and blabbing everything because man,

579
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,280
people can't keep their mouths shut when it comes to some of these rumors.

580
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
That's kind of funny.

581
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,760
Well, one of these people that can't keep their mouths shut about rumors or release

582
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
dates and stuff would be me.

583
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,600
And well, there's lots of good stuff coming, well not a whole lot of good stuff, but still

584
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,800
some pretty good stuff coming out this week on all the systems.

585
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,960
Starting off with the DS, and Rob, apparently I was wrong earlier, Clubhouse Games is coming

586
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
out this week.

587
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Alright!

588
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,180
So that would be pretty good.

589
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:29,080
Crash Boom Bang, if you happen to be craving some Crash the Bandicoot party games, I don't

590
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,440
know, might be something for you.

591
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,780
Anyways, we also have Legend of Spyro A New Beginning coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox

592
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
and the GameCube.

593
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,780
If you have a 360, yeah you can play the Xbox version of that if you're really craving some

594
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,840
Legend of Spyro.

595
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,480
Also Avatar is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the GameCube, and all the portable

596
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,760
systems as well.

597
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,020
Should be pretty cool.

598
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,560
You're a fan of the Family Feud, that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Game

599
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Boy Advance.

600
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Worst game I've played at E3, I'm sorry to say.

601
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,660
And don't get me wrong, I love the Feud.

602
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,040
I love the Richard Dawson days where he'd make out with all the women on the show, but

603
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,980
something is just not right in the past 20 years now with Family Feud.

604
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
So sorry to say.

605
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,040
Mortal Kombat Armageddon also coming out this week on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

606
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Oh, that's this week.

607
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
Oh, very cool.

608
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,600
Maybe not so much on the Xbox this week, because I mean the date we have in our system right

609
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,280
now, somehow Midway moved their date just on the Xbox version, so don't be surprised

610
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,640
if you don't see it in stores this week, but you know, it is slated though for this week

611
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,220
though for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, so.

612
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:47,880
But whatever, anyways, then of course on, you've got Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on PlayStation

613
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,320
2 and Xbox as well as PSP.

614
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
For the PC, you're getting a few things.

615
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,800
Warhammer 4000 Dawn of War Dark Crusade, Devil May Cry 3 Dante's Awakening Special Edition

616
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:08,640
on the PC, also Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf 07, and Dirt Origin of Species.

617
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Alright.

618
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
So that should be pretty good.

619
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,760
Next week's going to be lots of good stuff, including Bully.

620
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Oh, okay.

621
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,200
And you're going to be getting that I'm sure?

622
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,440
I'll be getting it one way or another.

623
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Alright.

624
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Let's see.

625
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,640
Next week in Japan, I've got Japanese release dates for you, or I should say this week in

626
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,000
Japan, not a whole lot of pickings for you guys in Japan this week.

627
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,440
It's kind of a slow week.

628
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,240
MotoGP 2006 is on its way, along with Rockstar Table Tennis making its way in Japan this

629
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
week.

630
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,380
I also forgot one in PlayStation 2, and this one is awesome, God Hand is coming out this

631
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
week.

632
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Oh.

633
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
And definitely worth checking out.

634
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,080
I'll actually have a review for that next week.

635
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,560
That's one of the games I have on my slate to play.

636
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Alright.

637
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Sounds good.

638
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,080
Jamie's not here tonight, so sorry to our European listeners, but we're just going to

639
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,240
not do your dates tonight.

640
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,680
No, I'm kidding.

641
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,240
I got you guys covered.

642
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Here we go.

643
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,120
Coming out this week, the week of the 13th, you guys have Crazy Frog Racer and English

644
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,600
Training on the DS, you know, because your English isn't good.

645
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
No, I'm kidding.

646
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,120
Obviously, that's going to other territories besides just Britain probably will be released

647
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,560
in the other European territories.

648
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,640
The Power Stone Collection on the PSP, a lot of people saying there's the reason to get

649
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
a PSP right there.

650
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
I'll tell you what.

651
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,360
I played it at E3, not the same magic at the Dreamcast.

652
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
I can't explain it.

653
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,960
It's just not the same magic, but hey, if you're a Power Stone fan, you might get a

654
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
kick out of this.

655
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,320
And then Resident Evil 4 Platinum Edition making its way to PlayStation 2 along with

656
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,480
Wild Arms 4, Steam Bot Chronicles also on the PlayStation 2 this week.

657
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,640
If you're a Game Boy Advance player, Rebel Star Tactical Command coming out for the GBA

658
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,960
this week in Europe.

659
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Have fun.

660
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Cool.

661
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,180
Some interesting information, which is not, well, I shouldn't say it's too surprising,

662
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:59,480
but Miyamoto's actually come out to say that the Wii is, well, the hardware is basically

663
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
a GameCube.

664
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,000
And, you know, that's kind of like saying a Pentium 4 is basically a Pentium 1.

665
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,360
Basically that it's on the same kind of architecture as the original GameCube, but of course, it's

666
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,060
going to be a little bit more souped up, you know, kind of like, you know, how a DS is

667
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,120
almost a Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance is almost a Super Nintendo and so on and so

668
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
forth.

669
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,400
And, yeah, I mean, big deal.

670
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,120
I mean, that's not a big surprise seeing all these games ported from the GameCube over

671
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,680
to the Wii, so.

672
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,360
Well, you know, now the anti-Nintendo fan base, though, is like, you know, oh, you're

673
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,520
paying $250 for a controller.

674
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Have fun, suckers.

675
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,200
And, you know, people are also saying about, you know, Super Smash Brothers.

676
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,080
I just saw a post in the live-drama community this afternoon that was talking about, you

677
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,280
know, Smash Brothers that's coming out on the Wii is not really going to be using the

678
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,920
Wii functionality in the main game, which is not much of a surprise.

679
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,640
I mean, you know, I kind of wouldn't want it to, but now they're saying, why don't

680
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,040
they just do it on the GameCube then?

681
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,760
Well, just because it's, well, the specs are still upgraded just because, it's just

682
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,360
like saying, you know, a PC nowadays, you know, which is still based on the same architecture

683
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,800
as a PC from like, say, 15 years ago, I mean, granted, they're not the same thing, but

684
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,400
they're based off the same architecture, so, so, you know, big deal.

685
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Like I say, play the games.

686
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,160
If you like the games, great.

687
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Who cares about specs?

688
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,280
I mean, you know, I don't give a shit of how many USB ports are on this thing.

689
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
It does not matter.

690
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,360
So, just play the games.

691
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
If you like them, great.

692
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:34,400
I mean, after all, Pac-Man wasn't really pushing, you know, the graphics or anything, so, whatever.

693
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Alright.

694
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,240
Bandit in our chat room says, Miyamoto said it himself that the Wii is a souped-up GameCube.

695
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,280
Certainly a quote a lot of people have been running with this week.

696
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,920
I saw that posted on a lot of blogs, but, you know, so, Sony said that the PlayStation

697
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,400
3 is future proof.

698
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,520
I don't care cancer, so, I mean, I don't believe that either, but whatever.

699
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Alright.

700
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,600
Well, if you are excited to be getting your hands on a Wii soon, good news for you.

701
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,380
The Wii production is exceeding expectations.

702
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:13,000
According to UBS, 2 million Wii consoles were completed in the third quarter, July to September,

703
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,080
to support the upcoming fourth quarter launch.

704
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,280
In addition, at least 7 million, and potentially as high as 9 million more units, are in the

705
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,360
build plan for the fourth quarter of 2006.

706
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,200
This production ramp handily exceeds a publicly announced target for 6 million units to ship

707
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
by year-end.

708
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,160
So, Nintendo may have been playing it conservative a little bit with their launch numbers, and

709
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,760
they may have more.

710
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,920
I still think, if you want to get this on launch day, you probably are going to be having

711
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,040
to do the pre-order or the campout or one of those things.

712
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,920
I don't think you're going to be able to walk into the store and pick one up if you didn't

713
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,200
do some type of pre-planning.

714
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,160
And it's great that they're going to have that many units, but this thing's on all the

715
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,680
Christmas lists, all the different retailers' Christmas lists, and once they launch their

716
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,400
marketing campaign for this, it's going to be the hot Christmas item, so you better get

717
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,640
on those pre-order lists as soon as you can.

718
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,240
How important are the launch days, you think?

719
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,940
Because there's been a lot of focus in the past couple generations of gaming about the

720
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,720
launch day and how the launch goes.

721
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,080
We had the Xbox 360 launch, which was this big ass deal, and the Wii launch is shaping

722
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,040
up to be huge as well.

723
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,480
PlayStation 3, it's kind of getting some mixed reactions, but certainly if you're a hardcore

724
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,760
Sony person, this is something you're looking forward to as well.

725
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,160
But how important is launch day?

726
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,800
Because I go back and I think about PlayStation 2, and I think about, I remember seeing the

727
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,440
lines on TV and stuff, but I don't remember being so excited about a PlayStation 2 right

728
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
on launch day.

729
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,120
How important is the launch, and yet the PlayStation 2 was still the most successful of the last

730
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
gen.

731
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
It's just the bragging.

732
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
It's the E-Penis thing.

733
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,200
It's basically, I've got the console and you don't, or I'm playing it first.

734
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
Everyone's got to be first.

735
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So I don't know.

736
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,520
I think what's important is how many units they can sell by the end of the year.

737
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,720
Right now in the U.S., I believe there are up to about 3 million Xbox 360 units.

738
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,880
Don't count on me on that, but I think that's about where they're at.

739
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,200
I think worldwide they're about 6 million.

740
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,200
And if they can sell 4 million Wii units in the United States alone, and I'm sure they're

741
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:24,380
going to be able to sell all 9 million units of the Wii, they're going to blow past the

742
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,520
competition really quick.

743
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,280
And that's going to probably show something to publishers, because to be honest, publishers

744
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,280
are going to make games mainly for those systems that have the most units out there because

745
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,420
they can sell more units of their game.

746
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,480
And that's going to be important when you don't want this thing being like the GameCube

747
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,300
where it didn't sell as many units, and so the third-party publishers didn't really support

748
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,300
that system.

749
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,620
Whereas now, if they can blow 9 million units away by the end of the year worldwide, that's

750
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,280
going to be a big, like, hello, pay attention to this.

751
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,200
But again, this is all speculation and what-ifs.

752
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Exactly.

753
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,120
So the damn thing could tank, for all we know.

754
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
It could.

755
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
It could very well tank, but I don't think so.

756
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,000
I think four-hour lines of E3 pretty much tell you it's not going to tank.

757
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Alright, we'll see.

758
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,200
Bandit in our chat room says, Best Buy better not say, oh, you can buy a Wii from us, but

759
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,640
only as a package deal.

760
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Agreed.

761
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
They are.

762
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,600
I bet you they will, because, and this is something that I will not buy at a Best Buy.

763
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,140
Well, I'm going to tell you why they're going to do that, though.

764
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,680
The reason why they're going to do that is because there's no margins on this thing.

765
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,520
That's one thing I mentioned a couple episodes ago, is that the margins on the Wii system

766
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,960
is only a few bucks, and they have to sell it in a bundle to make money off this thing,

767
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,360
because they're only making like ten bucks off of each system, so it makes sense to bundle

768
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,080
it with some controllers and, say, a game.

769
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,280
I know our company-

770
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,640
Well, that's going to be what dooms the sales of the Wii, if it-

771
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Not necessarily.

772
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,920
I mean, you don't have to buy it that way, because you can go into a Walmart or whatever

773
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,440
and buy it just by itself.

774
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,440
But some of these companies are going to want to try to do this, and you just don't have

775
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
to buy from them.

776
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,400
Or if you're really desperate to get the system at launch, then yeah, you will buy that.

777
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,760
But I don't know.

778
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,740
No one's saying anything for sure, but don't be surprised that they do, because they've

779
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,920
done it in the past with other systems.

780
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,900
Anoush in our chat room says, Sky, do you know of any major stores that are doing a

781
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,480
midnight release?

782
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
I imagine a lot of them.

783
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,000
Imagine most will probably have to.

784
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,640
Who did ones for Xbox 360?

785
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,200
That's probably who's going to do them for Wii.

786
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,200
I mean, you can just kind of go down that list right there.

787
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,720
Whoever did them for Xbox 360 is probably going to do them for Wii.

788
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,880
I know a lot of GameStops do them for Madden, and just games, not even systems.

789
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,320
So I would imagine if there's a big GameStop in your area, or EB, any of those type, they

790
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,360
will probably be doing a big midnight party.

791
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,480
God, does that mean we have to go out and report on a midnight launch?

792
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Fuck no.

793
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,280
Why do I have to go out there, dude?

794
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,200
I'm getting mine early.

795
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,760
For the goodness of better journalism.

796
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,080
Yeah, okay.

797
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,800
Listen, I don't want to be like the news crew, because you know every fucking year they always

798
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,320
have some stupid station.

799
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,600
Look, there's people outside waiting in the cold for their new game system.

800
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
What's this new game system?

801
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
The why?

802
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,920
Why must you have the Nintendo why?

803
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
It's Wii.

804
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Why?

805
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Why is it called...

806
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
It's Wii.

807
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Why?

808
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,320
I believe I may have actually already committed this program to be working with other podcasters

809
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,760
in some type of Wii news live on launch night.

810
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,160
By the way, there's a staff meeting after the show.

811
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,920
Way to go, Rob.

812
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Loser.

813
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,260
One of the games you might be expecting, I'm not sure if at launch, Bionicle Heroes is

814
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,880
going to be heading to the Wii, and Bionicle Heroes is going to be pretty good.

815
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,520
It's actually done by Traveler's Tale, which I believe is people behind Lego Star Wars

816
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,080
and the Lego Star Wars original trilogy game, so of course you would imagine, okay, Lego's

817
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,440
game, Bionicle Heroes, yeah, makes perfect sense.

818
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,240
This of course, information coming from the ESRB website, which seems to be leaking a

819
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:12,480
lot of info on upcoming games for the Wii, so look for that soon.

820
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,360
All right.

821
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,360
I will.

822
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,360
Thank you for that.

823
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,360
Excellent.

824
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:23,280
A lot of people were bitching about the Wii not having a wireless, or I'm sorry, a wired

825
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,840
internet port in it because of course it supports the wireless internet, but what if your house

826
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,560
isn't wired for wireless?

827
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,560
Then you're screwed, right?

828
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Not necessarily.

829
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Not necessarily.

830
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,840
Here's the thing, the dongle, remember the dongle that you got for the Nintendo DS?

831
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,400
You can use that on your Wii, and that was something I had speculated a while back that

832
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,440
you could probably do, so that's pretty cool.

833
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,040
So that's something you can do.

834
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,680
Also, Nintendo has announced they are going to provide an ethernet kit so that you can

835
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,800
directly connect the console to a standard internet router.

836
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,920
It's going to go from USB to ethernet.

837
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Probably.

838
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
Yeah.

839
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,720
Good job Nintendo in squelching that little cry of...

840
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,200
I can't imagine those would be too expensive.

841
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I guess...

842
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Well, how much was the other dongle?

843
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
$30?

844
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
$35?

845
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
It's like $25 or something.

846
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,560
I'm going to be honest though, if you're going to be spending that kind of money to get your

847
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,960
Wii online, you might want to think about just upgrading to a wireless router for your

848
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
house.

849
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
They're not that expensive these days.

850
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,120
Yeah, wireless router, and if you really don't want to spend the money, just spend $25 on

851
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,520
the wireless thing, because then that way you can use the Wi-Fi with your DS as well.

852
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,000
And with your PSP, I think.

853
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So...

854
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Why not?

855
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,040
Al Mullet brings up a good point.

856
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,880
You can use the dongle on your Wii.

857
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,600
Why doesn't that sound right?

858
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I don't know.

859
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Good point.

860
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
It sounds dirty.

861
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,320
You know, I wonder what's kind of interesting about that?

862
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,000
I wonder if you could use...

863
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
No, no, you wouldn't be able to use that.

864
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,720
I was going to say use the Xbox 360 one, but that's $99, and that plugs into the Ethernet

865
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
port anyways.

866
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
All right, anyways, sorry.

867
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
I digress.

868
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,560
Now, there's been a lot of, in the past, people cheating in MMOs, basically hiring people

869
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:10,120
to farm gold for them or to sell accounts to them that are high level and stuff like

870
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
that.

871
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,600
And they're kind of doing something like that on the Xbox 360 with someone's gamertag.

872
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,600
That's right.

873
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:23,280
Someone actually has their gamertag and their Xbox 360 hard drive up on eBay for sale.

874
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:31,560
The gamertag rants6, who has, by the looks of it, over 30,000 points on their gamer score.

875
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,760
From what I understand, this is actually the number one ranked gamer score on my gamer

876
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,120
card net, I guess so.

877
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:47,960
The guy's got 19 bids as of right now, as of when Xbox 360 updates reported it.

878
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,160
They've actually, and the biddings end up to $5,000 already.

879
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:59,400
And the reason why the guy's selling it, well, he's buying a PS3.

880
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Very interesting.

881
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Interesting.

882
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,440
But why would you buy this just to have the gamer score?

883
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,720
You know, this kind of goes along with another story that it didn't make our show roll for

884
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,760
tonight, but surely a lot of you guys have heard about this.

885
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,040
There's that company out there that's offering to inflate your gamer score or earn you 3,000

886
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,160
gamer score points for, what was it, 3,000 points for 200 bucks, something like that.

887
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
Why?

888
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
Why would you do that?

889
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,920
For about 10 bucks, you can do the same thing, and even more than that.

890
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,720
And why you would even want to spend this kind of money.

891
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,720
What do you mean, for 10 bucks, you can do the same thing?

892
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,700
There's ways you can inflate your gamer score.

893
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,700
You can cheat.

894
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,700
How?

895
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
How?

896
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Saves.

897
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
Saves.

898
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Saves.

899
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Saves.

900
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,700
Transferring game saves.

901
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,700
Certain game saves on games will actually unlock achievement points for you.

902
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,700
I got you.

903
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,700
Okay.

904
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,640
Or you can actually hack saves to do that as well.

905
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,840
Why you would spend $300 on this?

906
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,640
Why would you even give away your personal account to some stranger that's beyond me?

907
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,640
I don't know.

908
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,760
But I bet you anything, this is what they're doing, is they're just $300 for like 10 minutes

909
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
of work.

910
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
Oh, whoops.

911
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
That story wasn't a show roll.

912
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
It was the next thing I was supposed to go over.

913
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Oh, well.

914
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Well, excellent.

915
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,840
We talked about it now.

916
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,760
We prepped really hard for tonight's show, ladies and gentlemen.

917
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Hooray.

918
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,360
Well, that's pretty awesome that you mentioned that.

919
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,760
Yeah, so let's just keep it moving.

920
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,760
Anyways.

921
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,320
I'm a psychic.

922
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,200
You know, I'm glad that there's people out there actually concentrating on Xbox Live

923
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,840
because it just wasn't really that annoying yet.

924
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:39,180
And so now there's a brand new device out there for Smack Talking called Smack Talk.

925
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,180
It's $29.99.

926
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:47,440
It's basically a little device that plugs into your headphone port on your Xbox 360

927
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:54,280
controller and it allows you to record five different Smack Talks into the device.

928
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,160
So you can push the button at any time to release an automated, you know, blah, blah,

929
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,160
blah.

930
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
I pwned you, noob.

931
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,680
You know, stuff like that, so hooray.

932
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,240
Or what most people do is like, you know, take South Park recordings from that World

933
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,280
of Warcraft episode, you know, total pwnage, and they just let him put it on the stupid

934
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,280
thing.

935
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,280
Yeah, so it comes through.

936
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,040
You know, because, you know, it's all.

937
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,600
You know what's going to be on mine when I get one of these.

938
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,320
Draw four, bitch.

939
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
Just kidding.

940
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,080
I'm not getting one.

941
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,700
I want to point out some of the chat in our chat room about the whole inflating your gamer

942
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,700
score thing.

943
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,800
El mullet has a method, one, sign up with Gamefly, two, rent four games at a time, three,

944
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,440
play the games, four, earn mad points.

945
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,600
And VX JasonXV agrees with that.

946
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,160
Just freaking play.

947
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,360
Seriously.

948
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,000
And Jeremy Todd one wants to ask, Loki, if you could sell your account for $5,000, would

949
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
you?

950
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,920
Sure would, because I'll just start a new one.

951
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,440
Who cares?

952
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,920
El mullet would like to share he's almost at 10,000 points through the Gamefly renting

953
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,920
method.

954
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,200
I think he does have the highest score on my friends list.

955
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,240
I just don't have time to play that many games.

956
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,240
I have that many games, too, to play, but I just don't have the time.

957
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,360
SSJ wants to know what are the five pre-programmed things in the Smack Talk device.

958
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,640
He says, FAG, FUCK, BITCH, OWNED, RETARD are the five that will be pre-programmed.

959
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,640
Yay.

960
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,640
He said FAG.

961
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,520
Why, people, why?

962
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,240
Well one of these games you may or may not be Smack Talking on is NBA Live 07, but I'll

963
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,880
tell you where the Smack Talk's going right now.

964
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,280
It's going to EA.

965
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,920
Quote from this community, NBA Live community letter to EA from nbalive.org, quote, at one

966
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,600
time EA was producing the best titles money could buy and one had little reason to look

967
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,600
elsewhere.

968
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,400
Now gamers have a sense that if you want the best, it's not EA.

969
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,660
Whether it's looking at the NBA 2K series for our basketball game fix, users leaving

970
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,720
Battlefield 2 because they feel the problems will never be addressed, or former FIFA players

971
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,120
moving on to Pro Evolution winning XI, it's a sense that we are all sharing.

972
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,480
We look at NBA Live over the last few years and we see the same basic game being re-released

973
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,640
with new fancy features.

974
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,640
You know, it's kind of funny because that's what all the non-sports games fans say about

975
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,640
these games.

976
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,000
You know, when they don't understand Madden 06, they go, it's just a roster update.

977
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It's even worse.

978
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It kind of is.

979
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Even the fans are admitting it's just a roster update now.

980
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's even worse with FIFA.

981
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,360
FIFA, they release two games a year.

982
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,440
The same elemental problems from the last few years are still there.

983
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,880
Some have been tweaked, but the overall issue still exists.

984
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,540
While there are plenty of new features, it gives the impression that EA is saying in

985
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,660
response to the lingering issues, yeah, well hey, look at this.

986
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,520
Be it an All-Star Weekend, Superstar Moves, or Dynasty editions, while those editions

987
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,540
are nice to have, it is piling on a base that cannot support it instead of addressing the

988
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,760
underlying fractures.

989
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,720
EA is just constructing a new structure on the old crumbling foundation.

990
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,760
On this letter, they put YouTube links to actual videos of the game being buggy.

991
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,080
Very interesting rise up of the fan community against this, especially that part where they

992
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,360
say they're all going to go play NBA 2K.

993
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
That's pretty...

994
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,360
Them's fighting words.

995
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,700
You've got to talk in numbers because, you know, they keep buying the games, you know.

996
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,240
I would be very interested to see if EA responds to this at all.

997
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
Probably not.

998
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,280
If they don't, that's...

999
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,280
I don't know.

1000
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,760
I mean, you can probably lose these rabid fans on the internet and still make money

1001
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,920
on the game, but, you know, you need to do something about this free publicity or it's

1002
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
going to go away.

1003
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Well, you know what?

1004
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,840
I mean, all EA seems to care about nowadays is money anyways.

1005
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,780
I mean, you saw the stories about how they're releasing, you know, Madden tutorial videos

1006
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,220
on how to throw passes and stuff, and they're charging on Xbox Live or, you know, Marketplace

1007
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,120
for this stuff, and it's basically stuff that should have been included in the game in the

1008
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,200
first place, and now they're charging, you know, premium content for this.

1009
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
Fuck them.

1010
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,160
A lot of responses in our chat room.

1011
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,480
Jeremy Todd 1 says, EA's response, blame Canada, not us.

1012
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,360
Deep Man says, EA games is never going to lose money as long as they're publishing Maxis

1013
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,040
games.

1014
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,360
JoeShe16 says, EA will not acknowledge their own faults.

1015
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:14,000
Black Wolf says, EA's response, you already bought our game, bitches.

1016
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Interesting.

1017
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Yeah.

1018
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,040
I mean, you bought them, so whatever.

1019
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,640
I would just, you know, wait to play them or wait to buy them, you know, wait for the

1020
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,200
reviews to come out so you can find out if it's buggy or not because, you know, this

1021
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,560
year actually 2K7 got a way better review than live, so we'll see.

1022
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,720
All right.

1023
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,820
All this news about buggy games makes me angry.

1024
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,920
You shouldn't, you should release your game with minimal faults.

1025
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,680
I mean, there's going to be bugs and everything, but minimal faults and not try to patch it

1026
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,400
all in the back end, or just not playing patch at all like some companies do, so that makes

1027
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,400
us angry.

1028
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
So you know what that means.

1029
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,200
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

1030
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,200
You got it.

1031
00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:04,480
Since Jamie's not here tonight, I will enter an FU to traffic on her behalf because that's

1032
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,840
her typical FU.

1033
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,920
Loki, should I be entering an FU to traffic on your behalf as well?

1034
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
I don't know.

1035
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,400
I wasn't really driving that much this week.

1036
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,800
No, I'm going to say FU to stupid people that are trying to use the self-checkout because

1037
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,840
it actually takes longer for them to self-checkout than it would to check out normally, and I

1038
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,040
think that's kind of funny sometimes that, you know, they put self-checkout place, you

1039
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,760
know, machines in these stores that, you know, people are not smart enough to actually be

1040
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,920
able to use, like Walmart, for example.

1041
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,360
There should not be self-checkout at Walmart because, my God, these people don't understand

1042
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,000
anything other than hunting games, so please remove the self-checkout from Walmart or like

1043
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,080
block it off, you know, I can test, you know, you should have a smart card, you know.

1044
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,580
I'm a smart person.

1045
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,680
I should be able to use this device.

1046
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,680
You're dumb.

1047
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,680
Go away.

1048
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,480
I have a much lamer FU to enter in tonight.

1049
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,780
My FU would go to BeatMania 2DX, specifically doubles mode, because it's hard.

1050
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:11,000
It's really hard, like, you know, I can pass, I'm okay at the regular seven-key mode, but,

1051
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,800
well, actually I've lost a lot of skill because I haven't played a lot regularly, so FU did

1052
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,760
that, the fact that there's no working BeatMania 2DX arcade machine in town anymore, but I

1053
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
really suck at doubles.

1054
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,560
I mean, I've been trying to use your controller to play doubles, and I passed, like, some

1055
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,040
fours, but that's about it.

1056
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,240
I suck.

1057
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,360
It's very humbling to go from being able to pass sevens and some flashing sevens to, like,

1058
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,800
oh shit, I can only play fours now because I'm doing doubles.

1059
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,440
Well, I can only play fours, and some fours, not even all of them, because I suck at doubles.

1060
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,840
Of course, the people that don't play BeatMania that listen to this show is like, what the

1061
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,840
hell is he talking about?

1062
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,340
What the hell is that?

1063
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,280
It's so hard, but anyways.

1064
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,960
Some interesting stuff coming out about NBA 2K7, actually, for the PlayStation 3, which

1065
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,680
will be coming out around launch.

1066
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,680
What's interesting, and, you know, you might remember before when they were talking about

1067
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,960
the PlayStation 3 how it's going to support up to seven controllers on one system, because

1068
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:11,240
it has the limitations of Bluetooth, but NBA 2K7 will support seven players offline, which

1069
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,040
is pretty interesting.

1070
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,520
Seven players is kind of an odd number.

1071
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,840
I would think six players would be good enough, since it's, you know, three on three.

1072
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,000
Do any of you have that many friends?

1073
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I don't have that many friends.

1074
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,840
I have four controllers, and I never play with four friends, because no one wants to

1075
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,840
play.

1076
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
It's so lonely.

1077
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,880
All in all, I'll come over and play, but not NBA, because I suck at those games.

1078
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,780
Double dribble for life, man.

1079
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,780
Double dribble.

1080
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,480
But, see, like, three on three would be cool for, like, NBA Street or something like that,

1081
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,520
you know, where they actually have three on three, but seven players is kind of, you know,

1082
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,360
so you have three on one and four on the other.

1083
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,960
They should have one person that's the ref.

1084
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,960
That'd be funny.

1085
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,960
Or the mascot.

1086
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Or the cheerleader.

1087
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,960
Cheerleader.

1088
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Excellent.

1089
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,960
That'd be cool.

1090
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,320
So, new peripherals are coming out for the PlayStation 3.

1091
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,480
Of course, I can't remember if we mentioned it last week, but the controller's being named

1092
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,480
the Sixaxis.

1093
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,440
Didn't we talk a little bit about that last week?

1094
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,680
I can't remember if that was last week or not, but, of course, the controller's officially

1095
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,460
been dubbed the Sixaxis, and IGN's posted some very nice little screenshots of all these

1096
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,840
devices that are coming out, and, by the way, have you been to GameStop recently?

1097
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,000
I saw some big banner ads for PlayStation 3 and Wii in the store, like, kind of place-holding

1098
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,080
where they're going to put them up on the wall when they get those systems in.

1099
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,080
Not yet.

1100
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,040
You can see a nice, big, clear picture of the PlayStation 3 controller on there.

1101
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,240
And then the memory card USB.

1102
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,760
Well, I don't really need to see a big, clear, you know, controller picture because I've

1103
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,760
touched it.

1104
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Whatever.

1105
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,760
Whatever.

1106
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,760
I'm just saying.

1107
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,760
I'm just saying.

1108
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,760
If you want to see one.

1109
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
I like the remote, though.

1110
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,760
Yeah, the remote's pretty cool.

1111
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,760
The remote has, like, 10,000 buttons.

1112
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,880
It looks like one of those all-in-one style remotes.

1113
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,160
Looks like a Harmony remote for the 360.

1114
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,080
I'm still weirded out by the whole Spider-Man font on the PlayStation 3, though.

1115
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,760
Did you like that remote that they had, the Harmony one, made by Logitech?

1116
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,760
You're like, that remote's $150?

1117
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1118
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,600
I still remember seeing that at Best Buy or whatever.

1119
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,600
I was like, what the?

1120
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,440
You don't need to spend $150 on a remote unless it will never get lost.

1121
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,120
But if it's that big, it probably won't ever get lost, so maybe it would be worth it.

1122
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,120
I don't know.

1123
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,120
It should be, like, attached to the PS3.

1124
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:15,480
Anyways, one thing that Sony's been combating, other than a lot of bad press, is that the

1125
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,920
PlayStation 3 is overheating and having, you know, some sort of a similar problem as the

1126
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,020
Xbox 360 did.

1127
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,280
And this is basically coming from Tokyo Game Show because a lot of the units were overheating.

1128
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,480
But from what I heard about Tokyo Game Show, that place wasn't air-conditioned.

1129
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,360
Wouldn't that fucking suck?

1130
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:36,440
I mean, as hot as it is in, you know, E3, let alone without AC, fuck that.

1131
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,440
I wouldn't go.

1132
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,440
That's a good deterrent, though.

1133
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,440
They should do that.

1134
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,440
Turn off the air.

1135
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
But, um...

1136
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,840
Then the place would smell so awful.

1137
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,880
Oh, it probably does anyways.

1138
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,800
So anyways, so yeah.

1139
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,600
Basically they were having overheating problems at Tokyo Game Show because, you know, the

1140
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,280
temperature of the building, which is so high.

1141
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,200
What's interesting, though, is I didn't hear about any overheating problems on the 360

1142
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,800
or you know, the Wii's or anything like that from Tokyo Game Show, so...

1143
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,800
I don't know.

1144
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,800
I guess we'll see at launch.

1145
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,800
This is why I don't...

1146
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,800
I don't know.

1147
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,800
I don't know if I want to buy a PlayStation 3 at launch.

1148
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,720
It's just too much stuff to get wrong.

1149
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,280
Plus, that thing weighs about 15 pounds from what I heard.

1150
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,200
I've already decided I'm not getting one to launch because there's nothing coming out

1151
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,400
at launch I'm interested in playing.

1152
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Exactly.

1153
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,400
Sorry, Sony fans.

1154
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,400
That's just how I honestly feel about it.

1155
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,400
There's nothing I really want at launch.

1156
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,240
It's all about the games for me, you know.

1157
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,200
Maybe if they had a Twisted Metal or maybe, I don't know.

1158
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Oh, I don't know.

1159
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,200
Final Fantasy 13 or something.

1160
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,400
Final Fantasy 13 would be cool, but to be honest...

1161
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,900
Well, then that would be kind of stupid seeing as 12's coming out at the end of October,

1162
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,200
but still, you know, you still get my point.

1163
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,440
There needs to be something...

1164
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,520
And if there is something like that, then I need to be hearing about it real soon.

1165
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,400
What do you think about those rumors that, of course, you know, this is nothing new,

1166
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,080
but that the launch is actually going to be delayed?

1167
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,160
They seem to be really picking up steam this week.

1168
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,160
I wouldn't be surprised.

1169
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,680
I mean, think about what happened in the spring.

1170
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,320
Oh, yeah, it's coming out.

1171
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
It's coming out in spring.

1172
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,320
It's coming out in spring.

1173
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
It's summer now.

1174
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,320
Oh, yeah, it's not coming out in spring.

1175
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,320
I forgot to mention.

1176
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,160
Oh, yeah.

1177
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,160
That sucks.

1178
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,200
I wouldn't be surprised if I see the news story for it, but right now I'm going to expect

1179
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,480
it to come out November 17th, and when it doesn't, I'll just be like, well, that's nothing

1180
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:27,560
new, but if they fucking miss this year's Christmas, that ain't good.

1181
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,560
That's not good at all.

1182
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,680
They're going to have another Neo Geo on their hands.

1183
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,680
All right.

1184
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,160
Well, there's some additional information out there on the PlayStation 3's interface

1185
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,160
this week.

1186
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:43,120
There's a video that shows up on GameTrailers.com, and it was a video that was taken during Tokyo

1187
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,120
Game Show.

1188
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,440
The video will show the web browser that's integrated into PlayStation 3.

1189
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,920
Now, there's something 360 doesn't have on it that makes PS3 stand out a little bit.

1190
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
I'm surprised that they don't have that.

1191
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,920
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised, too.

1192
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,440
NBA 2007 is in the video running at 1080p at 60 frames a second.

1193
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,500
It shows a little bit of the PSP connectivity, some of the photo browser stuff, and the visualizer

1194
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,320
that goes with the music.

1195
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,400
Really think PlayStation Portable interface, that's the PlayStation 3 interface.

1196
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,640
Well, at least it's consistent.

1197
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:19,640
It is, but straight down to pop the game in, you have the background change and the little

1198
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,680
animation icon video or whatever.

1199
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,120
Yeah, same thing, so not a huge surprise.

1200
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:32,720
What is kind of surprising, though, is that the PSP, there's been a lot of stuff going

1201
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,920
on in the homebrew community for the PSP, including, and this is very interesting, a

1202
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:43,480
brand new device that someone's actually creating called the PSP Touch Me.

1203
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,240
Where did the PSP touch you?

1204
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,080
Show me on the doll where it touched you.

1205
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:55,320
It's actually going to be a device that plugs into the USB port and puts kind of a glass

1206
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,920
screen over the actual screen, and you'll be using a stylus with it as a touch screen.

1207
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:08,120
It's kind of interesting to see homebrew people come out with this stuff, thinking of ideas

1208
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,880
that Sony themselves probably didn't even consider.

1209
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,000
Even if Sony themselves came out tomorrow and said, hey, we're going to sell this touch

1210
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:23,320
screen adapter for the PSP, would it, because like you say, the stuff has to be out there

1211
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,120
for the games to be made for it.

1212
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,680
That's why peripherals traditionally have not done very well, because they weren't very

1213
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:35,520
well supported on the game front, so why would the PSP release a touch screen officially

1214
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,640
if no third party games are going to support it?

1215
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,600
I don't think they would anyways.

1216
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,020
They might be accused of copying.

1217
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,920
So what the hell can I use this for?

1218
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,000
Homebrew games, which is only going to support some homebrew games right now, and it's designed

1219
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,800
to use as an add-on, and it will cost you $56.

1220
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,320
No word on when it's going to be released, but it looks pretty cool.

1221
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,200
I don't know.

1222
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,000
I'm not buying one, but it's kind of neat.

1223
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,080
I think it's neat that the community came together and built that.

1224
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,280
I think that's the neatest part of it for me.

1225
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,440
They built a GPS device for this thing already, so...

1226
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,920
Isn't there an official one now?

1227
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,800
There is an official GPS device that's coming out later this year.

1228
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,360
Could that happen where Sony decides to make an official one, or would they not do that

1229
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,040
out of fear of being called Nintendo copiers?

1230
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,680
I don't think they would.

1231
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,520
I think they think it's gimmicky.

1232
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
They didn't get any.

1233
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,080
They did die twice, so I don't know.

1234
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,600
But I mean, look at some of the cool stuff homebrew is doing.

1235
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:40,080
They released a custom firmware this week also, a 2.71 firmware that runs homebrew games.

1236
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:47,880
So you can run your current games right now for the PSP and homebrew without any modification.

1237
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:53,200
The only thing is you can't upgrade yours using an official upgrader that comes out

1238
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,920
later on, but you can always downgrade it back to 1.5 and then upgrade again if you

1239
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,920
really wanted to.

1240
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,240
But come on, they've broken every firmware that they come out with, so that's pretty

1241
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,240
awesome though.

1242
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,680
That's going to start to bring this segment to a close.

1243
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,680
We're going to get into the DDR previews first.

1244
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,120
We have been premiering over the past several weeks some new tracks from Dance Dance Revolution

1245
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,380
Ultramix 4 coming out for the Xbox very soon.

1246
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,380
Later this month, right?

1247
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,380
This is last we heard.

1248
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,380
Yeah.

1249
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,380
Don't know.

1250
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,380
Wait, what?

1251
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,380
Ultramix 4.

1252
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,320
Oh, no, no, that's in the middle of November 9th.

1253
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,880
Oh, I thought it was this month.

1254
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,880
No, November.

1255
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,880
Well, shoot.

1256
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,880
Well, that's all right.

1257
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,840
It seems like there's been a lot of good reaction to the songs we've been playing so far, so

1258
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,800
it'll be well worth the wait for a lot of folks, I think.

1259
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,360
People are still busy with Supernova trying to figure out how to beat Pizza Box and all

1260
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,360
that.

1261
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,880
I completely forgot the mention about stuff about Universe and the price of it, which

1262
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,560
you know, and I'm going to say this is kind of preliminary right now because I don't...

1263
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,940
This is not coming to us from official sources.

1264
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:01,240
This news that Loki's about to give is not from an official source.

1265
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,960
It's from his distribution channels.

1266
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Yes, exactly.

1267
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:10,360
Universe, $49.99 for the game by itself, $79.99 for the game plus a pad, which I don't understand

1268
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:15,360
why they would do a by-the-self version of the game seeing as there's no pad for the

1269
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,160
360 yet, so I don't know.

1270
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,440
But hypothetically, the pad's going to have to be USB, right?

1271
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,440
It is USB.

1272
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:28,280
So does that mean if I happen to own a Red Octane pad that had the USB for my StepMania,

1273
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,040
then I could use that on the 360?

1274
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,040
Maybe.

1275
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,040
Maybe.

1276
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,040
Maybe.

1277
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,520
Well, I mean, is it going to show into your system as two different games that there are

1278
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,800
not two different games?

1279
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,080
Well, it might not know.

1280
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,840
Depends on how it maps out because, you know, that's compatible with the PC, you know, where

1281
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:50,420
you can map the keys for a USB controller, but you can't just plug any USB controller

1282
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:55,720
into the 360 and it will automatically work, so whether it supports it or not.

1283
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,320
Well, take it with a little bit of a grain of salt, but those look to be the preliminary

1284
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,320
prices for the game.

1285
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,080
Yeah, it's just like BeatMania for the US, remember how we announced originally that

1286
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,400
it had two SKUs, one without the controller, one with the controller, and then later on

1287
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,200
they decided we're just going to do the one with the controller because no one has the

1288
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,440
controller yet in the United States, which is stupid, but yeah.

1289
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,440
That makes sense.

1290
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,440
All right.

1291
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,960
Well, let's get into some previews from DDR Universe, which is coming out sometime this

1292
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,800
winter and DDR UltraMix 4.

1293
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:29,240
We're going to start it off tonight with a song from DDR UltraMix 4, and our good buddy

1294
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:34,240
Midihead also does songs under the name Monolithic, in fact, I believe that was the first name

1295
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,480
he was using, and we call him our good buddy because he actually does the intro to our

1296
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,840
show here at Orange Launch Radio.

1297
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,240
If you ever wondered where that little ditty at the beginning of our program came from,

1298
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,240
that was actually written by him.

1299
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,320
Well, he has a song that's going to be in DDR UltraMix 4, and it's called Arms, the

1300
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,560
Alpha Omega Extended Mix, and we're going to play it for you right now on the DDR Sneak

1301
01:05:52,560 --> 01:06:14,040
Eeks Orange Launch Radio.

1302
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:38,240
It doesn't take so long, running in the gauntlet of my fears, drained of all my energy, slippin'

1303
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:58,160
in the sea of all my tears, feelin' what is cold as I start to freeze, shoutin' out for

1304
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:15,960
help as I go down, deep inside this liquid grave, the water rushes in, I start to drown,

1305
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:33,760
you reach for my hand and hope to say, I looked upon you, concerned was in your eyes, your

1306
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:49,680
tears, they hurt my back, seized me from sorrow, and dried the pain away, so I could

1307
01:07:49,680 --> 01:08:07,920
find another day, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't

1308
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:24,800
turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've

1309
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:42,560
got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't

1310
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:59,440
turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've

1311
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:23,280
got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't

1312
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:51,280
turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've

1313
01:09:51,280 --> 01:10:19,280
got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't

1314
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:47,280
