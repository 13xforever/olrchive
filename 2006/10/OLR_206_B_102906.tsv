33476	40200	And if you want to hear all the news we already talked about, you've got to go to part A. If you're thinking like, hey, why doesn't this podcast talk about this?
40280	41540	Well, maybe we already did.

46142	47323	We love getting emails from you guys.
47691	52576	We got a whole crapload of them this week because we had a long period there with the pre-taping of our show last week.
