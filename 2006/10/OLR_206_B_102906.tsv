66120	67120	Iím joking.
67120	68120	I like getting email.
68120	71400	Usually youíll share them with me anyway if theyíre really good or really bad.
71400	73120	I love the hate mail though.
73120	79120	I finally just told somebody off in the email and he was so retarded that his only response
79120	80120	was yawn.
80120	84620	Iím like, ìHaha, pwned.î Iím sure that person is still listening and just got a boner
84620	85620	hearing you say that.
85620	86620	Good.
86620	89620	Iím joking because I think that your hate mail is hilarious and really stupid.
89620	93080	So send your hate mail to mailbag at orangealmsradio.com so Dark Star Kara can make fun of it.

100320	108600	Well, Toys ë Us did their wonderful pre-orders for Playstation 3 and the Wii on the 29th.
108600	111920	So that already happened if youíre probably listening to us now.
111920	118880	And yeah, it was a clusterfuck, much like the Gamestop EB pre-orders.
118880	125480	They actually were having lines of people lining up a day in advance.
125480	127280	So pretty crazy.
127280	132480	A lot of the Toys ë Us stores were getting anywhere from like, what was it, I think it
132480	146240	was four to eight Playstation 3s and like sixÖ
