00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:01,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:24,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 203 for this, October the 8th of 2006.

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:32,903
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is your first time tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, remember, or hear for the first time, that our show is released in two parts every week.

5
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:36,884
[SPEAKER_06]: We tape live on Sunday nights and then split it up and release it to our podcast feed twice a week.

6
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:43,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to hear all the news we talked about in part A, you've got to go download part A. But now it's time for part B, isn't it, Loki?

7
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:43,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

8
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:48,653
[SPEAKER_07]: and, uh, as we mentioned in Part A, uh, Final Fantasy XII.

9
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been pirated to the internet.

10
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:52,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too surprising.

11
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:57,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Games have been pirated before, but it's 30 days before the game is, you know, set to release in the United States.

12
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, that's pretty interesting that it's pirated.

13
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:07,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so anyways, the ISO's leaked to torrent sites and, uh, various news group sites.

14
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:09,745
[SPEAKER_07]: None of which I'm a member of.

15
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:11,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um...

16
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:16,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it's apparently legitimate from the people that have it.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Not me.

18
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's interesting.

19
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:26,685
[SPEAKER_07]: You should spend your money on the actual game.

20
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't steal, because pirating is bad.

21
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll review you next week.

22
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:41,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Now wait, what I'm curious about is, you know, sometimes when albums get leaked early, like, I don't know, like, didn't the Eminem, his last album, get released early?

23
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,954
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they had to actually bump up the street date of the CD.

24
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:46,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that might happen with this game?

25
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:47,515
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

26
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if the game's already done and in the can, what are we waiting for?

27
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:51,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's play it!

28
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:52,777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a review copy.

29
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:55,278
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what got leaked, is a review copy.

30
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:55,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

31
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:57,778
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what else has been leaked to the internet?

32
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,159
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

33
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,099
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Groove 2 beta.

34
00:01:59,599 --> 00:01:59,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

35
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:00,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

36
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:01,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

37
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:02,400
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

38
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:10,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The gaming companies need to keep a lockdown on that stuff.

39
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:11,515
[SPEAKER_07]: They do, and you know what?

40
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:12,996
[SPEAKER_06]: All the journalists are going to be hurting.

41
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:16,618
[SPEAKER_07]: No one to blame but themselves, because these are their copies that get leaked out.

42
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:18,339
[SPEAKER_07]: What could they do to stop this?

43
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Put serial numbers on them somehow, or what?

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,723
[SPEAKER_07]: They could make them so they're only able to play on dev kits, and hope that the reviewers have dev kits.

45
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:31,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, honestly, are you really going to have to fish for good reviews for Final Fantasy XII?

46
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:32,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

47
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,548
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you could do that.

48
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Watermark them.

49
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:51,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, each individual copy, although I know it's going to be pretty difficult, each individual copy is watermarked so that you can check a certain, you know, byte signature or whatever and see, oh, Bill over at such and such gaming site leaked that out.

50
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to kill him.

51
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to sue him for $11 billion.

52
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So, my take on this, you know, I don't know.

54
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:04,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, great, you get to play three days early.

55
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,280
[SPEAKER_06]: ESRB Don't Play Games

56
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:41,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron Ruby, the Underground Gaming Culture spokesperson, has a score to settle with the ESRB.

57
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:46,851
[SPEAKER_06]: The ESRB has been independently applying and enforcing ratings and guidelines on online privacy since 1994.

58
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:56,478
[SPEAKER_06]: The writer stated in his opinion column that the system applied to rating games should be different from those currently applied to TV and movies, which I disagree with.

59
00:03:56,538 --> 00:04:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you want parents to know what the ratings are clear as day, make them the same as movies.

60
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:03,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, well, oh well.

61
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, how do they give out ratings anyway?

62
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they read and watch.

63
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:15,738
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens is the game developers fill out a questionnaire on what the game's about and the game developers submit it with footage of the most extreme scenes from the game.

64
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:26,100
[SPEAKER_06]: There are three trained raters, not expert game players, if you check out the website you'll see this is true, from the board and then they hand out the rating based on what they read on the form and see on the videos.

65
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:37,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So according to the writer, quote, I find it alarming that the ESRB does not bother to base its ratings on the entire experience of playing a game, instead relying far too much on submitted clips.

66
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:55,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is interesting because that doesn't surprise me because I remember, and I'm not going to say who this was, but I was at a conference, or I should say a media show once, and I overheard a developer saying about a game that featured a lot of cleavage in it, you know, and a lot of, you know, female...

67
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,072
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

68
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:26,187
[SPEAKER_06]: but there's huge fines for lying and stuff as the makers of Grand Theft Auto are finding out, although I still to this day say they weren't lying, they were just careless and thinking they took out a portion of the game that they didn't.

69
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:42,300
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's gotten so ridiculous now where they're, you know, rating content that doesn't exist in the game, you know, like Oblivion, you know, where they're rating it M because, yeah, underneath the virtual clothes there's virtual nipples, so I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.

70
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:44,362
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

71
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:50,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But some other interesting stuff, speaking of virtual nipples.

72
00:05:50,879 --> 00:06:00,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Playboy, you know, they've been doing this thing for the last couple years now, releasing the Women of Video Games spread in their magazine.

73
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, virtual naked women to oogle over.

74
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:13,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And both Fleshbot and Kotaku have actually been running a preview picture of it, and we've got a list of the people that are going to be featured in there, as well as...

75
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:41,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see, such wonderful people as Sarah Morrison from Tabula Rasa, two of the women from the Scarface game, and we've got two women from God of War 2, and Alicia Claus from Bullet Witch, Dr. Yasmin Lin from Timeshift, and Erika from Splinter Cell Double Agent.

76
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Bunch of babes I've never heard of.

77
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a bunch of games that aren't out yet, too.

78
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:45,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

79
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:51,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So, very interesting, and that's supposed to be coming out, I guess, later this year.

80
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:52,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you look at the spread?

81
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:54,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did.

82
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:54,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice boobies?

83
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:56,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Virtual boobies.

84
00:06:56,734 --> 00:07:01,877
[SPEAKER_07]: The one chick I thought, you know, when I first looked at it, I'm like, why did they put Blood Ring in it again?

85
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:05,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games, so, I don't know.

86
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess if you're into that stuff...

87
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:10,938
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're into boobs.

88
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:17,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're into this, like, you know, virtual... Aren't they all fake boobs in Playboy?

89
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

90
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:20,064
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all airbrushed and everything.

91
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:21,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what's the difference?

92
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Virtual boobs or airbrushed boobs?

93
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:23,186
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

94
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,447
[SPEAKER_07]: These are probably more real than some of the pictures that are in there.

95
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

96
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:29,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's cool.

97
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

98
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Very early pictures still, though.

99
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:37,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a... They're going to have a two-page fold-out in the final version.

100
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,331
[SPEAKER_07]: and 6 pages of gaming content.

101
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many pages of boobies?

102
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:44,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of boobies.

103
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:49,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Playboy is a lot of ads and there's not that many boobies in that magazine.

104
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:55,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you be picking up this copy of Playboy for the articles or for the research material?

105
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:56,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I did last year, I think.

106
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Your wife probably took it from you.

107
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:00,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she did.

108
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:07,090
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you that haven't met Loki's wife, she's hilarious, that's all I can say.

109
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,431
[SPEAKER_06]: She's had cameos in this program.

110
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:12,173
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something else I was going to mention, because this was also on Fleshbot, linked to the same story.

111
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:12,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dear.

112
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:22,120
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a Nerdcore 2007 calendar out starring Sherry Roberts, and there's one picture... Oh my god, my sister!

113
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:24,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad joke, sorry.

114
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:30,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, there's one picture, though, that I thought was funny, and I showed Rob this earlier...

115
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:32,848
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

116
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:05,750
[SPEAKER_06]: and if maybe chicks wearing gaming accessories aren't your thing.

117
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that's hot?

118
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:08,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it could be, yeah.

119
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think your wife will think it's hot?

120
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:11,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably she'd think it's stupid.

121
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:15,336
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, it says it's a limited edition.

122
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:18,878
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have 2,500 copies.

123
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:20,219
[SPEAKER_07]: They're $25 each.

124
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Features 12 months of girls with a complete daily calendar grid and all that stuff.

125
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:28,364
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty big and...

126
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,289
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

127
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,506
[SPEAKER_06]: GameDevelopersConference.com

128
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:21,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk Like a Pirate Day, Tokyo Game Show, The Transformers, The Movie, Opening Day, and other flagship nerd videos.

129
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:25,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

130
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's putting this out?

131
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Slashdot?

132
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:32,772
[SPEAKER_07]: No, totallynerdcore.com is where you can purchase this calendar.

133
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:36,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta say, you know... Damn it, we need to get them on the show and get one of these models on the show.

134
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:37,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

135
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:40,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that'd be totally awesome to have any model on this show.

136
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:42,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

137
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:49,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say so let's move on from boobies to violence!

138
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,918
[SPEAKER_06]: All the great games have either boobies or violence in them.

139
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Violence, violence, violence.

140
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,140
[SPEAKER_06]: This story coming from GamePolitics.com, our friends over there.

141
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has to do with a question and answer session with the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.

142
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:08,505
[SPEAKER_06]: His name is Richard J. Gellis.

143
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:09,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was this interesting quote.

144
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:17,089
[SPEAKER_06]: The question was, Excuse me, sir, but what is your opinion on video games and the lack of parenting to control the ever-increasing teen violence?

145
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Answer.

146
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games play almost no important role in teen violence.

147
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:33,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Teens with a predisposition to being violent may be drawn to violent video games, but overall, other factors besides television, music, or video games are more important risk factors for teen violence.

148
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:40,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that quote from Richard Gellis, the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.

149
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:43,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Also the Director of Center for Research on Youth and Social Policy.

150
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So this guy does know what he's talking about.

151
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:46,502
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

152
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:10,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually going to be pretty much the same kind of stuff.

153
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,044
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got your Brain Age score and stuff like that.

154
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:18,826
[SPEAKER_07]: So imagine Brain Age minus the touchscreen and on your PSP.

155
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:20,566
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of big news.

156
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:21,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

157
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:27,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this guy, he was doing the DS stuff, and those games are huge in Japan.

158
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And now he's kind of defected in a way to the PSP.

159
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:35,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Nintendo's going to slow down their Big Brain series anytime soon, but kind of interesting.

160
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:39,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what possessed him to do that.

161
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:40,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Money?

162
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:40,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

163
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,447
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more brain training games coming out.

164
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:44,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

165
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:45,849
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?

166
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Majesco has two coming out in November.

167
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Brain Wave, I think it was called.

168
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:57,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's just going to be like all those crappy Nintendogs knockoffs we got a while back.

169
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:58,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

170
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:01,679
[SPEAKER_07]: November is the month for Nintendogs knockoffs.

171
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,561
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got the whole dogs, cats, hamster life, horses.

172
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:09,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, I showed her to think what might be possible in a hamster life.

173
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:14,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on and get some feedback from you guys, the listeners.

174
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:18,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

175
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura is typically here to read through the email.

176
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:22,630
[SPEAKER_06]: But as you know, she's not here tonight.

177
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to instead borrow her asbestos suit and put on the gloves and dig into our mailbag.

178
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:33,284
Thank you for watching!

179
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:59,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so this first email comes to us from Deekman.

180
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Deekman writes, Hey guys, just thinking about the new next-gen consoles and had these thoughts.

181
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:06,428
[SPEAKER_06]: One, the cost of the Wii at $249.

182
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:14,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they chose to set it at this price not to make money, even though it is selling it more than it's worth, but for the simple reason that Nintendo doesn't want you to get any other console.

183
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:21,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think for a second, with a $150 to $200 console, an Xbox 360 sounds mighty enticing to go with it.

184
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,553
[SPEAKER_06]: But a $250 console plus games?

185
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:25,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Suddenly that extra $360 doesn't look as good.

186
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:37,280
[SPEAKER_06]: To back this up, I remember hearing a quote posted on Kotaku by Reggie that said something along the lines of, and I'm paraphrasing here, quote, I've heard of the Wii 60, but our users buy our consoles because they want a different experience.

187
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:39,342
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want something else, they can get a DS.

188
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:44,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm paraphrasing, but it sounds like Nintendo is being smart with the pricing, if only to cut out the competition.

189
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,545
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of that?

190
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:47,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, that sounds pretty accurate.

191
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's an interesting theory, but I don't think that was a factor in the price point they chose.

192
00:14:55,993 --> 00:15:00,776
[SPEAKER_06]: was because it makes the 360 sound less appealing.

193
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:01,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

194
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:05,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if they could make it cheaper, I think in the long run it's which system costs which.

195
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:13,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think your average family is only going to get one console unless they have some hardcore gamers in the house, if even that.

196
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:14,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it's a good thought.

197
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:18,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's a good theory, and it may be right, but I just kind of think there's a lot of other factors that come into play.

198
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:21,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Deekman also writes this, too.

199
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Region-free PlayStation 3.

200
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:30,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Not as elaborate as the last theory, but what if the reason Sony is making the console region-free is quite simply to combat mod chippers?

201
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:37,098
[SPEAKER_06]: A strong case, and the one most used in courts, especially in Australia so far, is that people mod their systems to play import games.

202
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,561
[SPEAKER_06]: What if this is simply a way to nip the next-gen mod chippers in the bud before they start?

203
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:42,581
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of that, Loki?

204
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:44,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be.

205
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I think mainly...

206
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:51,837
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the whole HDMI being added to all the different systems and stuff.

207
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:56,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that kind of ties in with it because now they can do the digital flag on all the movies.

208
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,340
[SPEAKER_07]: And they might be able to do that with all the games now, too, if they have HDMI on there.

209
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,262
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess, you know, since they do give the option not to use the HDMI, that might not be the case.

210
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,584
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, region-free, I mean, I don't see why they don't.

211
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:14,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when you think about it, because a lot of games, I mean, if you're going to import them, that's more sales for them anyways.

212
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:14,826
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

213
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:16,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see what the big difference is.

214
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:28,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted you get stuff early, but it's not going to be, you know, it's only, it's not going to be translated for over here unless it already comes in both languages anyways, which why wouldn't you release them in both territories?

215
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:28,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

216
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:31,618
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

217
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:00,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good work.

218
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:01,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Still listening, Dekeman.

219
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

220
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:06,647
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as Canada goes, you know, it's a nice thought.

221
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:11,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to maybe retire up there, but just for right now, there's too much going on for me here in the States.

222
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:13,235
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely will be taking another vacation up there.

223
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:14,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably next year.

224
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:15,318
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

225
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:22,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next email comes to us from Malice, the artist formerly known as Stupid Baka, or so his signature says.

226
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,159
[SPEAKER_06]: You folks still are awesome and I really like the show.

227
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I love sitting in my room and doing my homework or talking to friends with the podcast in the background.

228
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:55,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I also like your guys' quirky attitudes and witty remarks from time to time, especially those that belong to DarkSakura and Sky.

229
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys make my day.

230
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:58,514
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, Loki, sorry, you suck.

231
00:17:59,274 --> 00:17:59,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

232
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:01,944
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you, seriously, for the words.

233
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:02,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

234
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:07,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is a recurring theme of discussion on the podcast, and I was just wondering what you guys thought of this.

235
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:11,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a member of my school's mock trial team and have been since last year.

236
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:17,913
[SPEAKER_06]: This year's case is People vs. Campbell, in which a student that is being bullied allegedly created a time bomb to blow up his school.

237
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:25,278
[SPEAKER_06]: He's being charged with acts of terrorism, intent to murder, placing an offensive substance in a public place, and possessing a violent video game.

238
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:37,716
[SPEAKER_06]: All the mock trial cases have pretrial arguments in which we argue to a judge about certain aspects of the case before it occurs, specifically in regards to evidence, the Constitution's Bill of Rights, and whether it shall be allowed during the case.

239
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:45,498
[SPEAKER_06]: The defense in this pretrial argument will argue that video games are protected speech under the First Amendment, which is something I agree with, as do you guys, I assume.

240
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:50,799
[SPEAKER_06]: This seems to be echoed as all the cases that they have given us that are relevant and have precedent

241
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,405
[SPEAKER_06]: are all in favor of the defense.

242
00:18:52,785 --> 00:19:04,990
[SPEAKER_06]: This is definitely a change as most of the cases each year, especially in pre-trial, are made so that they aren't one-sided and can be argued both ways, ensuring for an exciting trial based on how good each side is, which is why I'll most likely be on the prosecution this year.

243
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wondering what you guys have to say about this as I know that you three are very vocal and have a lot to say about this issue.

244
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:12,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a nice three-day weekend.

245
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it's not three days for me.

246
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to work tomorrow even if it is Columbus Day.

247
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Lucky you guys that get it off.

248
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:26,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I don't know much about the specific case that you're citing.

249
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:31,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Just based off of other cases, I think you pretty much said what I feel.

250
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree with the fact that

251
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games are a form of art.

252
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:42,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about art as in a classic sculpture you might see, but it is a form of expression.

253
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:43,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Expression is art.

254
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,848
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no different than a movie or a CD.

255
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:51,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, therefore, it should be viewed at very similarly by the public.

256
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,693
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

257
00:19:54,893 --> 00:20:01,978
[SPEAKER_06]: There are the people that criticize violent movies, and they probably do criticize violent games, but you can't say that a kid...

258
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:09,182
[SPEAKER_06]: played a video game and that's what caused him to go crazy because what about the R-rated movies he might have seen?

259
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what about the dirty music he might have been listening to?

260
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:14,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But more importantly, what about the parents?

261
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:17,304
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the home life?

262
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:18,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was the love?

263
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:19,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was the hug?

264
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was the how was your day?

265
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:25,786
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more important than the CDs, movies, or video games combined, in my opinion.

266
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:28,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, anything you want to add to that?

267
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,608
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's basically just bad parenting.

268
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:31,268
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

269
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:38,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Boy says, Dirty Music?

270
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:48,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email comes to us from Mr. Wonderful.

271
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:50,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys and lady.

272
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,822
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, thanks for putting on the show.

273
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:55,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I emailed Sky earlier but figured that I should be thanking you all.

274
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:58,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I recently graduated college and got a great job right after graduation.

275
00:20:59,244 --> 00:20:59,544
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

276
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:30,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to agree, though, that you really should play Pinball Quest.

277
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:30,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will.

278
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though she's not here tonight, I'll make sure she sees that part of the email.

279
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:35,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure she will appreciate that.

280
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will make her play Pinball Quest.

281
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, forgive me if these questions have been asked, but I'm still making my way through the backlog.

282
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,250
[SPEAKER_06]: On to a few quick questions.

283
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,212
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, if you guys have the power to resurrect one franchise for a well-done remake...

284
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:51,943
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you go for?

285
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:59,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's just the recent re-release on GBA talking, but I've got to think a Wii Bionic Commando would do the job pretty nicely.

286
00:21:59,548 --> 00:21:59,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thoughts?

287
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:01,749
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was 3D, maybe.

288
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,871
[SPEAKER_06]: What game would you like to see Wii made?

289
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:12,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know Kid Icarus is the obvious answer that most fanboys, I'm sure, would be foaming at the mouth for.

290
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would definitely be my number one answer.

291
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:19,661
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as a GameCube game that I'd like to see on the Wii, I want to see F-Zero have another shot.

292
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:22,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure there will be some type of F-Zero on the Wii.

293
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,062
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really enjoyed the GameCube one.

294
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:31,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it was a little bit underrated in part because the arcade version had one key flaw.

295
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:43,328
[SPEAKER_06]: and that was the fact that there was really only the one model which was very expensive because the car moved around a lot and the fact there was only six tracks in the arcade and you can unlock them all in the home version.

296
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:50,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was a lot to still be discovered with that concept that I think unfortunately in the execution kind of fell apart.

297
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole driving with the Wii stick might be kind of interesting in F-Zero or something.

298
00:22:57,194 --> 00:23:00,617
[SPEAKER_06]: At least even with the slightly souped up graphics and sound, I would like to see that.

299
00:23:00,657 --> 00:23:02,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And the sound coming out of the controller.

300
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:05,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really looking forward to a new F-Zero game.

301
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And online, please.

302
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:08,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything, Loki, you can think of?

303
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:11,045
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard.

304
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:12,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know.

305
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:17,790
[SPEAKER_07]: What could we do that would be really awesome?

306
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:20,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

307
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Drunami says Capcom seriously needs to put Okami on the Wii.

308
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:27,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's not a remake, though.

309
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,249
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN says Kirby's Dream Course.

310
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:30,809
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be kind of fun.

311
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:32,390
[SPEAKER_06]: You could actually swing the ball.

312
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,371
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a fun game on Super Nintendo.

313
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:36,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

314
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:39,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say just remake.

315
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:40,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Make a good...

316
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Even like a Castlevania would be kind of cool.

317
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,992
[SPEAKER_07]: A good Castlevania for 3D.

318
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:49,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it like a first person shooter would be kind of neat.

319
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:49,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

320
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:50,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see them do the 2D.

321
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:52,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I got excited by the 2D news last week.

322
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:54,156
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have a 2D Castlevania too.

323
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:58,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Just maybe Blaster Master maybe?

324
00:23:59,258 --> 00:23:59,899
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's hot.

325
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to the next email.

326
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, it's NeoDude.

327
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Belated congrats on 200 and all that.

328
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:09,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to talk about the Sonic demo on 360 for a moment and why it sucked.

329
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:11,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I played that actually now.

330
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:12,493
[SPEAKER_07]: What'd you think?

331
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:13,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucked.

332
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like horrible controls.

333
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:18,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't even make it over the first jump because...

334
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:22,264
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just veering off to the side when I had tapped the button to the side.

335
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:24,726
[SPEAKER_06]: The email continues from NeoDude here.

336
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The big thing was the camera sucked.

337
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:30,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic has always relied on good camera control and it's not here.

338
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:39,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, the demo gave Sonic everything he had at the end of Sonic Adventure 2, including the bounce bracelet, which leads to many unexpected deaths, especially when you're trying to light dash in the air.

339
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:47,144
[SPEAKER_06]: If they include a window that tells you what the X button does at any time and fix the camera and maybe take out the bounce bracelet, everything else should be alright.

340
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:48,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Catch you next episode.

341
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:50,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope they change something.

342
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:55,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they've been getting negative feedback around the web, and who knows, it may result in a delay of the game.

343
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:57,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but it would be nice to see them go back and change things.

344
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:58,422
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

345
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:04,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think what they should do is have an option when you're running straight to be able to strafe a little bit.

346
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,968
[SPEAKER_07]: They need a strafe button in it.

347
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:15,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, when I'm running straight, you know, ahead, I'm not, like, going to, when I try to, you know, be a little off on the rings there, I'm not going to all of a sudden veer off to the side.

348
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:17,218
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they need to fix.

349
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:24,021
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, this one, last email tonight comes to us from Laser123454321, and he writes this.

350
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:25,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura.

351
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:30,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I first want to thank you for giving the Bomani community its first podcast as well as your general game coverage.

352
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:31,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Read, you rock.

353
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:36,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I like all the politeness, like the fluffing of the egos in the first paragraph of all our letters tonight.

354
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:40,256
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, seriously, we love the fact that you guys are so receptive to it.

355
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:40,716
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

356
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, I would like to get your in-depth view of the new DDR Supernova for PlayStation 2.

357
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:58,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to tell about some of the experiences I've had, the new Stellar Master Mode far outshines the Dance Master Mode of DDR EX and EX2, as the majority of the unlocks can be done just by completing the first few trials in each Stellar joint and then facing the showdown.

358
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:01,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally play Controller Controller Revolution.

359
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,463
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it Button Button Revolution, but that's fine.

360
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:07,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like to face the Diamond EX Showdown or EX Showdown in each joint.

361
00:26:08,548 --> 00:26:10,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything you want to say additional about DDR Supernova, Loki?

362
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it yet.

363
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:16,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play it a little bit, and I agree.

364
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:20,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave my fuller review on last week's program, so you can go back and download that in Part A.

365
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:28,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely think it's a solid entry into the series and will give you lots of new songs.

366
00:26:28,065 --> 00:26:32,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the song list and I do agree that Stellar Master Mode is an improvement on the mode they had last year.

367
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't despise the mode they had last year so much.

368
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:42,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt it's okay to have the really, really hard songs kind of tricky to unlock because they're extra, they're bonus.

369
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:44,673
[SPEAKER_06]: They're supposed to take a lot of effort to unlock.

370
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,694
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think they did do a little bit better this time.

371
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:48,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions.

372
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:52,416
[SPEAKER_06]: One, what do you think about the song list as compared to the other US releases?

373
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:54,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a pretty good song list.

374
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:57,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I do too, but Max 2 is still my favorite overall.

375
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, as an old school DDR fan.

376
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:02,943
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think it was better than Extreme 1's song list.

377
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:05,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, what are some downfalls with the game?

378
00:27:07,246 --> 00:27:12,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Link mode disappearing was an interesting thing that was a bit of a downfall of the game, I think.

379
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:13,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

380
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Other downfalls for the game.

381
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:18,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the fact that they got rid of a lot of the videos.

382
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:22,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the whole dancer in the custom-generated background or whatever.

383
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:29,474
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I liked about DDR was some of the art backgrounds they had, and I always kind of looked forward to seeing some of the ones they came up with for new songs.

384
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of not there in Supernova.

385
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:41,379
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a stupid request, but one I made before I went on Extreme 2 is not being able to put in edits on...

386
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:48,083
[SPEAKER_07]: for the eye toy stuff, like you can't put in hand things on your edits.

387
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:50,165
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have been cool if you could do that.

388
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:57,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, hardly anyone actually uses it, but how hard would it be to put that as an option for your edits?

389
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand.

390
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Three, what do you think about Konami bringing back Battle Mode?

391
00:28:03,574 --> 00:28:06,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it should be more prevalent in their next release.

392
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:10,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should really explore what they can do with versus mode.

393
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:15,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to say this way back when the show was strictly about Bomani games and we had the three hour show.

394
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the future of DDR was in a versus mode.

395
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see more competitive style play and options.

396
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:29,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's a good step in the right direction but I'd like to see that option more fully researched in the next release of DDR and do more with it.

397
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:31,163
[SPEAKER_06]: So just a thought.

398
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,359
[SPEAKER_06]: 4.

399
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:34,359
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your opinion on the online controversy?

400
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,101
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that don't know, the game features a few songs that are online only.

401
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:45,825
[SPEAKER_06]: That is, you cannot play songs that are exclusive to online play in the free dance mode offline, even after having played them in the online mode.

402
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:52,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Some have speculated that when Konami shuts down Supernova online play, like they did for Extreme 2, that these songs will be lost.

403
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:57,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Others believe that when this happens, Konami will reveal an unlock code for the songs for offline play.

404
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:03,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's the doom and gloom most people are shouting about.

405
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:05,192
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something extra.

406
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:07,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And what if you have an Xbox that doesn't go online?

407
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:09,956
[SPEAKER_06]: There's many great songs that you're missing out on.

408
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:15,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, granted, I see the difference because you can download those songs and play them offline whenever you want.

409
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:24,709
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would speculate that if there's a Supernova 2 or whatever's next, which I would find it hard to believe there's not going to be at least one more PlayStation 2 game next year...

410
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:30,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I would bet almost anything you're going to see those five songs in the default song list for next year's game.

411
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know anything.

412
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:34,955
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just speculation.

413
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:37,056
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, it would make sense.

414
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:41,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people wouldn't complain about repeats so much because they didn't really have them in the last game.

415
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,942
[SPEAKER_07]: What if they're just going to be unlocked at a time unlock type thing?

416
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're going to be unlocked...

417
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:50,915
[SPEAKER_07]: on a certain date, say, when the other games come out.

418
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:52,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they are.

419
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:53,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously think this is it.

420
00:29:53,897 --> 00:29:55,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're ever going to be unlocked.

421
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:58,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I think online only is online only, and I think that's it.

422
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:01,260
[SPEAKER_07]: That's until someone puts out a code for it.

423
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:02,001
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

424
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:03,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone might hack a save.

425
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:07,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be honest, the content is there, so true.

426
00:30:08,364 --> 00:30:08,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So who knows?

427
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:09,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

428
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,987
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, lastly, and finally, for those involved in the Stepmania community, Loki might want to read this.

429
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:15,636
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

430
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:38,332
[SPEAKER_06]: have expressed interest in doing a Supernova theme, and Takuya will start work as soon as he has rips from the Supernova disc.

431
00:30:38,692 --> 00:30:43,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe K Eternal is waiting for StepMania 4.0's theming engine to be finalized before he starts work.

432
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:52,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that hard to rip stuff off that disc, and to be honest, it's funny how I mentioned in the Groove 2 beta had already been leaked.

433
00:30:53,539 --> 00:31:00,323
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already made tools to basically re-skin it, re-put songs in it for your own stuff like they do in the Groove 1.

434
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:08,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's going to be possible pretty soon just to do all that stuff pretty easy.

435
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:14,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hell, they've already automated the whole ripping of In The Groove stuff, you know, off of this once the game comes out.

436
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:18,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be honest, I'm just not that big on playing DDR on my computer.

437
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:19,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is the thing.

438
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:37,800
[SPEAKER_07]: With the Indigroove rips that you can do in the editing, you can actually either, if you have a modded PS2, you can dump it to a disc and actually play it on the PlayStation 2, or if you have a hard drive like mine does, you can dump the ISO to the hard drive and play it off of that, and you can actually play your DDR on PlayStation 2.

439
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:39,201
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

440
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:43,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to do it for the Mailbag this week, and lots of great emails this week again.

441
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to those we didn't get to tonight.

442
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:49,928
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send us an email, it's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

443
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the next story.

444
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, excellent.

445
00:31:53,348 --> 00:32:04,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the big story this week is, well, one of the big stories, Mark Raine is basically saying that the second-gen game, Gears of War, on the 360 looks better than the first-gen PS3 titles.

446
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:07,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, he's sort of right on some of those, but...

447
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:15,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony says their next generation starts when they say so, I say bullshit.

448
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:20,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically stating that the next gen will start when that game comes out.

449
00:32:21,497 --> 00:32:21,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

450
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:25,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, big talk, but we'll see.

451
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:28,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like people just kind of whipping it out back and forth.

452
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:28,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

453
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:31,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Typical PR, trying to slam the other guy type stuff.

454
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:37,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, speaking of the Xbox 360, of course, when Doom came out, a lot of people were like, where's Duke Nukem?

455
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:40,668
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to bring us Doom, you need to bring us Duke Nukem.

456
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:45,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was an interesting post by a staff of 3D Realms.

457
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, you'd be surprised what they've turned down.

458
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:51,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't just assume MS will want it just because you like it and it's popular.

459
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:55,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Hate to sound defeatist, but it's not as easy as send it to Microsoft and get it on there.

460
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:56,460
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

461
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:17,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

462
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:37,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

463
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:38,962
[SPEAKER_06]: They can release two games in one day.

464
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:40,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a hard time.

465
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:47,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Their schedule is so book solid when things keep getting pushed back and we have to get things like, you know, the Project Gotham deck for Uno to hold us over.

466
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:51,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they're so booked, why don't they release something else that's ready to go?

467
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:52,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Release two games in one day.

468
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it going to kill the server that much?

469
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:55,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

470
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:57,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think they're afraid that one game would outshine another.

471
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:02,255
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they don't release like 10 or 15 at a time because they want all the games to have a fair shot.

472
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

473
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,017
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it doesn't make sense.

474
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:05,577
[SPEAKER_07]: That's stupid.

475
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:06,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Duke Nukem 3D

476
00:34:31,465 --> 00:34:31,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

477
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:32,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see what the big deal is.

478
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:40,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what the big deal is, they don't want to work on it because they're not fucking done with Duke Nukem Forever yet, and to be honest, just put the damn thing out.

479
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:41,929
[SPEAKER_07]: It's never going to be perfect.

480
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,570
[SPEAKER_07]: You're never going to finish it.

481
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:48,272
[SPEAKER_07]: The generation of hardware is just going to get better and better each time you're about done.

482
00:34:48,992 --> 00:34:50,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's never going to happen.

483
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:52,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

484
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:58,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other interesting stuff, though, like Duke Nukem 3D, you know, had pretty good multiplayer.

485
00:34:58,316 --> 00:34:59,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, another game that has really good multiplayer...

486
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:05,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Lost Planet, and we will be seeing a multiplayer demo this winter, which is pretty cool.

487
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,444
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, looking forward to that, probably in November sometime, would be my guess.

488
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:14,327
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I wasn't that big on Lost Planet when I played it.

489
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'm not sure what all the hype's about.

490
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:22,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's just not my kind of game, but maybe a multiplayer would change my mind, if I had a lot of fun with that.

491
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:23,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

492
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:24,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you more excited about this game?

493
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:25,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you enjoy the first demo that came out?

494
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:26,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked the first demo.

495
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:29,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if I'd buy it, though, right away.

496
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:29,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

497
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:34,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I think about that time I'm going to be busy with the Wii.

498
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:37,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if I really want to buy this game right away.

499
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was a cool game.

500
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:40,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong.

501
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:41,602
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks really good.

502
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:46,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't need to be buying that many games now.

503
00:35:48,585 --> 00:35:50,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's do another story here.

504
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:52,447
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is regarding Full Auto 2.

505
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:59,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be releasing some PS3 online details.

506
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:07,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the developers behind Full Auto 2 actually released some of the details about what online is going to be all about.

507
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:10,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was on this Radio PM podcast.

508
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:15,969
[SPEAKER_06]: The Full Auto 2 producer Mike Gallo from Sega of America talked about what was going on.

509
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:24,112
[SPEAKER_06]: and OPM asked, so when you go into Network Play, you'll see sort of a browser and they say when you first turn on the machine, it logs you in automatically.

510
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:26,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you can change that in the settings.

511
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:29,773
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a user ID and an online profile that's set up through the PlayStation.

512
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:31,493
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have anything to do with that.

513
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,414
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all done through the PlayStation Network.

514
00:36:33,714 --> 00:36:39,495
[SPEAKER_06]: When you log in and as long as you have an ID and you're an active online member, when you go into the online mode, you get a menu option.

515
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:40,995
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to pick ranked or unranked play.

516
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:43,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll see what games are available and then jump into one of those.

517
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

518
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,621
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more information.

519
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,243
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as stat tracking, is it all within full auto?

520
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:50,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that outside?

521
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:55,807
[SPEAKER_06]: When you play Ranked Play, your stats, pretty basic set of stats, wins, losses, will get uploaded to GameSpy.

522
00:36:56,228 --> 00:37:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to see, I think we have it sortable by, it's worldwide and monthly or all time, so you'll get to see who's ranked where.

523
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:06,555
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to access it from our website as well, so you can look at those stats independently of the game.

524
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Achievements are big on 360.

525
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys think about throwing in that concept for PS3?

526
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:14,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually do not have that in Full Auto 2.

527
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:17,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a feature we had to regrettably not support.

528
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:21,377
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it was just because of that moving target with the development timeline.

529
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:26,338
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to make sure our online modes and network play was solid before we added some of that other stuff.

530
00:37:26,718 --> 00:37:28,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, that was one of the things we had to drop.

531
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting, though, if that means that there's not really going to be achievements like we know it on the 360.

532
00:37:34,523 --> 00:37:37,684
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to be on whatever games that they want to support it on.

533
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:39,685
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of big news, I guess.

534
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:41,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

535
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they could patch it later.

536
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:43,247
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be kind of neat.

537
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:44,528
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

538
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:45,148
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

539
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:49,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're going to go now to a new segment, which is a new game.

540
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,031
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to play a new game tonight.

541
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:53,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, you know I'm going to sucker you into playing this game.

542
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:53,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready for it?

543
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:55,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

544
00:37:55,513 --> 00:37:55,894
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

545
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:57,735
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you'll like this game.

546
00:37:57,935 --> 00:37:58,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

547
00:37:58,315 --> 00:37:58,555
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

548
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:02,476
[SPEAKER_06]: and we thought we'd bring on a contestant of our choosing tonight.

549
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:03,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Caller, are you there?

550
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:05,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am.

551
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:06,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, and who is this?

552
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:08,458
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Bobby from Atlanta.

553
00:38:08,698 --> 00:38:10,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Bobby from Atlanta.

554
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:14,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, is this the same Bobby that does his own show on Sunday nights on another network?

555
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:15,601
[SPEAKER_06]: You know it is.

556
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:16,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

557
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:27,847
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now there's a reason why I invited Bobby to be the first one to play this show or to play this new game here on the show is because, you know, there's been a little bit of smack talking in the past between, you know, Loki and

558
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:35,081
[SPEAKER_06]: and Bobby and Chromehounds, which never happened, and these whole, you know, oh, we're going to play each other at these games, and it never really happened.

559
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:36,162
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it didn't.

560
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:43,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So I decided we here at Orange Launch Radio would provide an opportunity for there to be a great podcast war, if you will.

561
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:44,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

562
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:45,007
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

563
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:46,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you ready, Bobby?

564
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:47,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to kick Loki's ass?

565
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:48,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I will.

566
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,209
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

567
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,850
[SPEAKER_06]: He sounds quite confident.

568
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Two words.

569
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:53,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Shenanigans.

570
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:54,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Shenanigans.

571
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:55,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Shenanigans.

572
00:38:56,352 --> 00:39:01,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, we're going to play a brand new game and it's called the Video Game Showdown.

573
00:39:07,038 --> 00:39:08,199
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible music, dude.

574
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no reason why we're using the Press Your Luck theme for this, but I just wanted an excuse to use the Press Your Luck theme at some point during the program.

575
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:16,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

576
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:20,518
[SPEAKER_06]: The Video Game Showdown is a brand new game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

577
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:23,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is how it's going to work.

578
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:28,619
[SPEAKER_06]: First things first, no fair using Google or the internet to cheat at this game.

579
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:31,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you people can do your research mighty fast, so no fair.

580
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,580
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on your honor.

581
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Bobby, I want a fair fight.

582
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I allowed to at least write things down?

583
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:40,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can write things down.

584
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:41,241
[SPEAKER_06]: That's certainly acceptable.

585
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,022
[SPEAKER_06]: You just can't research.

586
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,922
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be on your own here.

587
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,721
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is how it's going to work.

588
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:52,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read you a list of ten items in a category, but only five of them actually apply.

589
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:55,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to guess which five are the correct answers.

590
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:58,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's tonight's category.

591
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:11,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's category is, per the website Video Game Charts, five of these games are the top five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.

592
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:12,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

593
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:12,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

594
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So tonight's topic is the top 5 best selling worldwide, keyword there, worldwide DS games to date.

595
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,487
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready for the list?

596
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:22,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

597
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:23,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here we go.

598
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:25,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's your 10 options.

599
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:41,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Crossing Wild World Brain Training Mario & Luigi Partners in Time Mario Kart DS Metroid Prime Hunters New Super Mario Bros.

600
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:51,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris DS, and WarioWare.

601
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:59,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, of those ten I just named, five of them are the best selling worldwide DS games to date.

602
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is again one more time real quick and then we'll get the answers.

603
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Crossing, Brain Training,

604
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:16,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario & Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart DS, Metroid Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Bros., Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris DS, and WarioWare.

605
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:18,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you about ready?

606
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:19,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I am ready.

607
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:20,265
[SPEAKER_06]: You're ready?

608
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:20,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

609
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:21,345
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

610
00:41:21,886 --> 00:41:22,146
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

611
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,487
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the five you're going to pick, Loki?

612
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:33,414
[SPEAKER_07]: The five I'm going to pick, Animal Crossing, Braintrain, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario Bros., and Nintendogs.

613
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:34,195
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

614
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, which five are you going to pick?

615
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:45,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, my five are Brain Training, Mario DS, New Mario Bros., Nintendogs, and Super Mario 64.

616
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there they are.

617
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:52,191
[SPEAKER_06]: So very similar lists, only one difference between them, and that could be the make or break.

618
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:57,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Now here's what happens, if we have a tie, and Bobby and Loki have the same amount correct...

619
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:05,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Then Bobby can either change one of his own answers after I tell him how many he has right or he can force Loki to change one of his.

620
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:06,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way we prevent a tie.

621
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:11,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's first check the correct answers and see if we have a tie tonight.

622
00:42:13,091 --> 00:42:16,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like we do not have a tie tonight.

623
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:17,594
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

624
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:20,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, we'll start with you.

625
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:22,558
[SPEAKER_06]: You got four right.

626
00:42:22,578 --> 00:42:22,838
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

627
00:42:24,515 --> 00:42:25,596
[SPEAKER_06]: 4 out of 5 right, not bad.

628
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:30,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Brain Training is correct, Mario Kart DS is correct, New Super Mario Bros.

629
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:32,758
[SPEAKER_06]: is correct, and Nintendogs is correct.

630
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:33,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are 4.

631
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki, that bastard got all 5 of them right.

632
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.

633
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:39,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe it.

634
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:41,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I was concentrating on Japan.

635
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:41,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you cheat?

636
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:42,622
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wasn't.

637
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:46,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I concentrated on thinking about what was popular in Japan.

638
00:42:46,737 --> 00:42:47,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's right.

639
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,099
[SPEAKER_06]: The top five selling games of all time.

640
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:54,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario Bros., and Nintendogs.

641
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:57,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And because they also packed in New Super Mario Bros.

642
00:42:57,905 --> 00:42:58,646
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, no they didn't.

643
00:42:58,666 --> 00:42:59,426
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't a pack-in.

644
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:01,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was a good guess from Bobby.

645
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:02,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's a trick though.

646
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:04,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario 64 was actually number six.

647
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:06,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really close.

648
00:43:07,313 --> 00:43:10,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my reasoning was just because it was one of the few games out when it launched.

649
00:43:10,751 --> 00:43:11,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, it was a good guess.

650
00:43:12,312 --> 00:43:15,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Animal Crossing, yeah, was kind of a surprise, but, you know, the game was really big.

651
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:16,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much around the world.

652
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:17,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're making a movie based on it.

653
00:43:18,035 --> 00:43:18,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

654
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:20,796
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be pretty big.

655
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:21,616
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

656
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:22,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good job, Bobby.

657
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:23,817
[SPEAKER_06]: You did really good.

658
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:24,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Four out of five is not bad.

659
00:43:24,998 --> 00:43:27,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And who knew that Loki had this superhuman power?

660
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I should have guessed, you know, since he works in distribution, you probably know something about sales figures.

661
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:32,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I cry in shame.

662
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:33,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Bobby.

663
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:34,663
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

664
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we'll give you a chance to plug your show.

665
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:39,405
[SPEAKER_06]: You have something you want to share about what's going on on the Bobby Blackwolf show this week?

666
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,981
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bobby Blackwell Show

667
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,800
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

668
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:28,105
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got newbies.

669
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:49,093
[SPEAKER_01]: and community chats and stuff.

670
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:50,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, very cool.

671
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what nights are those on?

672
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a set schedule for that yet?

673
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:58,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, XBL radios on Tuesday, Evil Avatars on Wednesday and Game Addict Oddlines on Thursday.

674
00:44:58,581 --> 00:44:59,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

675
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:01,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, congratulations to those guys.

676
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:04,746
[SPEAKER_06]: We're happy to see them on board and we'll be looking forward to that over at allgames.com.

677
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:05,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

678
00:45:05,727 --> 00:45:05,967
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

679
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:13,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, thanks so much for playing our little game tonight and next time I'll do a topic, you know, maybe about like video games in Atlanta or something that Loki couldn't get.

680
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:16,055
[SPEAKER_01]: There wouldn't be five things in that.

681
00:45:18,044 --> 00:45:21,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I thought Atlanta was like one of the top five cities for gaming, like right under Seattle.

682
00:45:21,946 --> 00:45:30,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, but you know, it's like in terms of video games being based here, I think like Midnight Club 3 was here and that's about it unless you count like sports games.

683
00:45:30,491 --> 00:45:31,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, interesting.

684
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:36,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they just sell a lot there because you guys have to stay indoors because it's so damn humid outside.

685
00:45:37,816 --> 00:45:39,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the heat, it's the stupidity.

686
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:39,437
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

687
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, thanks so much for playing our game tonight.

688
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:42,379
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

689
00:45:42,399 --> 00:45:43,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, all right?

690
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:43,879
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

691
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:44,480
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

692
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, ladies and gentlemen.

693
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:51,521
[SPEAKER_06]: from AllGames.com does his own program over there Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

694
00:45:52,402 --> 00:45:54,583
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of our live listeners actually listen to his show.

695
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:57,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a bit of a warm-up before they come over to Orange Launch Radio, so that's pretty cool.

696
00:45:58,164 --> 00:45:58,785
[SPEAKER_06]: That is pretty cool.

697
00:45:59,065 --> 00:46:00,345
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go back to the news.

698
00:46:00,646 --> 00:46:01,046
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

699
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:04,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we were talking about games being leaked out early and stuff.

700
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:09,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this has to do with mod ship and HD loader programs out there.

701
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:15,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, actually, some of the major ones were actually...

702
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:19,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Nailed for over $9 million recently.

703
00:46:19,982 --> 00:46:31,191
[SPEAKER_07]: The ESA announced that a federal court in California ordered a group of defendants to pay over $9 million in damages for violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

704
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:45,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And the violations were against Divinio, the maker and distributor of mod chips for all consoles, French resident Max Lohm, and Canadian resident Frédéric Leggett.

705
00:46:46,532 --> 00:46:52,394
[SPEAKER_07]: for trafficking of mod chips and software circumvention device called HD Loader.

706
00:46:53,174 --> 00:47:13,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's basically, of course, the HD Loader, for those who might not know, was a device that was available on the market for a while, allowing you to dump games to a hard drive built into your older PlayStation 2, whether that be one that you provide or the official Sony hard drive, and you can put games on there.

707
00:47:14,395 --> 00:47:14,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one.

708
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my HD loader because it allows me to play import games.

709
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:21,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just loads things faster, too, on the HD loader.

710
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:22,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It does load things faster.

711
00:47:22,278 --> 00:47:24,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I like just not having to switch out the discs and everything.

712
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love it.

713
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:27,620
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how a bachelor pad looks around the TV?

714
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:32,842
[SPEAKER_06]: There's discs everywhere outside of their case because they're all too damn lazy to put it back in the right case.

715
00:47:32,862 --> 00:47:38,585
[SPEAKER_07]: What I like using it for is when I used to, before I got my 360, when I used to take my PlayStation 2 to work to play games...

716
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:42,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have to carry around like 50 discs with me.

717
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:43,823
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all dumped to my hard drive.

718
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:49,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can just, you know, bring my PlayStation 2 and a couple controllers and the hookups and away I go.

719
00:47:49,587 --> 00:47:51,508
[SPEAKER_07]: And plus the load times were a lot less.

720
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and DDR, it was awesome.

721
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:55,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like instantly into the song.

722
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:59,192
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I don't know, but it's gotten worse since then.

723
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:02,834
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, before, you know, when I first got it, you had a cap of 120 gigs.

724
00:48:03,354 --> 00:48:04,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you can pretty much use now.

725
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:08,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you can, it supports the two terabyte drives that you can hook up, um,

726
00:48:08,564 --> 00:48:09,465
[SPEAKER_07]: via USB.

727
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:10,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

728
00:48:10,565 --> 00:48:14,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's so... I mean, you can literally put almost every single game out there.

729
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:17,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you can also go rent games and then load them on your HD loader and then you have them forever.

730
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not that you'd know anything about that, would you, Loki?

731
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:21,792
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wouldn't.

732
00:48:23,413 --> 00:48:25,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm beyond renting games nowadays.

733
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:25,715
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

734
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Who needs to rent games when they're freely available on the Internet?

735
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:32,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, Loki, Loki.

736
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:34,881
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a...

737
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,881
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

738
00:48:55,845 --> 00:49:01,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So just because it's releasing late in Europe doesn't mean you won't have an impact here in the United States.

739
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:07,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, that's 500,000 PlayStation 3s that were expected to go to Europe at the end of this year.

740
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:11,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, that's 500,000 less consumers to sell games to.

741
00:49:12,136 --> 00:49:20,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So publishers are probably going to delay games that they previously were going to release this year to 2007 just to take advantage of the greater user base in Europe.

742
00:49:20,962 --> 00:49:22,903
[SPEAKER_06]: So we all get screwed by this.

743
00:49:22,923 --> 00:49:24,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't this kind of what you were saying earlier?

744
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:27,386
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for a whole different reason.

745
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:33,852
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for the fact that they haven't gotten their dev kits in a timely manner, and so they're not able to finish the game, period.

746
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:47,824
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm talking about earlier in the program, you were talking about how sometimes, or I should say, like say the Wii sells 9 million units, I think you said this in Part A, then that's 9 million available systems for people to want to publish for.

747
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:48,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

748
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:49,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it the same logic here?

749
00:49:50,346 --> 00:49:51,967
[SPEAKER_07]: In a sense, yes, but

750
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:59,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't really apply, like say if there's 500,000 units in the United States, that doesn't mean they're not going to release a game here.

751
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:04,446
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's no systems obviously in the UK, they're going to delay the launch of a game there.

752
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:10,349
[SPEAKER_07]: But just because Europe doesn't have their game system yet does not mean that they won't launch their US copies here first.

753
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:15,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So not only will Europe get screwed by the release of the system, but now all their games are going to be delayed six months because of this.

754
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:23,552
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they'll just come out when the PlayStation 3 launches instead of just, you know, being launched at the same time.

755
00:50:23,572 --> 00:50:30,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the same thing happens with, you know, different region games like Tomb Raider will come out in the UK first and then it'll come out over here.

756
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:38,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not mean, you know, if, for example, we could release, you know, PlayStation 3 games here first and then just wait to release them there.

757
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:43,976
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter because they need time anyways to, I guess, you know, print more copies.

758
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:55,244
[SPEAKER_07]: One interesting thing, though, I have to add to this, was that there was an interview with the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe World Vice President, Jamie McDonald.

759
00:50:55,444 --> 00:51:00,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And he claims that Europeans don't mind that they have to wait an extra four months for the console.

760
00:51:00,548 --> 00:51:05,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And they asked him, what would you say to consumers who like Sony and want to buy your product?

761
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:10,739
[SPEAKER_07]: but perhaps feel because they're in Europe they will always be last in line.

762
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:19,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, European consumers have shown that historically they don't mind that because they end up buying as many PlayStations if not more than the U.S.

763
00:51:19,105 --> 00:51:19,645
[SPEAKER_07]: and Japan.

764
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:23,908
[SPEAKER_07]: In Europe, it doesn't seem that the release of our platforms after the U.S.

765
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:26,530
[SPEAKER_07]: and Japan in the long run affects how consumers feel.

766
00:51:27,931 --> 00:51:31,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of our listeners over in the old country might feel a little different.

767
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, guys.

768
00:51:33,815 --> 00:51:36,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just me or do you feel a little different than what this guy is saying?

769
00:51:36,485 --> 00:51:38,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, I thought that was very interesting.

770
00:51:39,606 --> 00:51:44,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's saying basically, well, since Europe usually gets screwed, you know, we're kind of used to it.

771
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:48,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're assholes stretched out now, it doesn't matter if we fuck them again.

772
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:52,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's pretty much what it comes down to.

773
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:57,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway.

774
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:58,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

775
00:51:59,593 --> 00:52:01,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, um, damn.

776
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki says the darndest things.

777
00:52:07,182 --> 00:52:08,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like kids say the darndest things.

778
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:14,679
[SPEAKER_07]: All we need now, we're just missing Bill Cosby and we've got another show all...

779
00:52:17,912 --> 00:52:20,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say this real quick before we get into the next story.

780
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,174
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something I wanted to talk about that for whatever reason isn't on the show roll.

781
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:26,736
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually kind of a busy week for news with the whole GameStop conference and everything.

782
00:52:28,056 --> 00:52:29,917
[SPEAKER_06]: The system's coming out soon.

783
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:32,618
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a story, an opinion piece.

784
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:35,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Sony need a figure like Major Nelson?

785
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, Major Nelson is sort of like the internet guy for the Xbox 360.

786
00:52:40,602 --> 00:52:44,564
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he kind of, you know, in a way, he's kind of a viral campaign in a way.

787
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:45,045
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

788
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:47,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, he starts buzz on his blog.

789
00:52:47,486 --> 00:52:49,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he's a popular guy.

790
00:52:49,307 --> 00:52:51,288
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on the system playing the games.

791
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:53,449
[SPEAKER_06]: People have run into him on Test Drive Unlimited and stuff.

792
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:58,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go over to Nintendo and you have very charismatic folks like Reggie.

793
00:52:59,232 --> 00:52:59,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we love Reggie.

794
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:02,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And Miyamoto, you know.

795
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:03,915
[SPEAKER_06]: But Sony has...

796
00:53:04,952 --> 00:53:16,161
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys, like, you know, as Jamie calls them, the crayon eaters and bike helmet, which, by the way, the photoshops in our forum that you guys did, fucking hilarious.

797
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:17,082
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the best listeners.

798
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:21,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, guys listening, if you've never visited our website, you must go to the forums just for this.

799
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:25,949
[SPEAKER_06]: The people doing the photoshops of the amazing crayon eaters over at Sony.

800
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:26,309
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

801
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:31,313
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, Sony, you know, has these guys that make these crazy statements like this.

802
00:53:31,814 --> 00:53:34,176
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, does Sony need somebody a little more...

803
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:38,280
[SPEAKER_07]: What they need is Willy Wonka.

804
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:39,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

805
00:53:40,361 --> 00:53:43,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's going to take some fucking magic to sell those consoles.

806
00:53:44,784 --> 00:53:48,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, some news about Oblivion on the PSP.

807
00:53:49,007 --> 00:53:51,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And we knew that there's got to be some catch to this.

808
00:53:51,788 --> 00:53:55,391
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to be able to put Oblivion that we saw on the 360 on the PSP.

809
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:56,331
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no fucking way.

810
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:59,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we did find out, though, according to the...

811
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,203
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

812
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:24,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Is any of it new?

813
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are they just recycled dungeons from the existing Oblivion?

814
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:28,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

815
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:31,537
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, I mean, what the hell is the point?

816
00:54:31,577 --> 00:54:36,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of those Game Boy Mortal Kombat games, which are fucking horrible compared to the console ones.

817
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:41,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, we had to take out half the moves because there's only two buttons and things like that.

818
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:48,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, the graphics for this Oblivion look kind of nice, but this is a game that should just simply be played on the big screen.

819
00:54:48,963 --> 00:54:49,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Or on a computer screen.

820
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:50,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm

821
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

822
00:54:52,517 --> 00:55:00,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but... I will suspend disbelief until I actually get to play, get my hands on it and actually play it, but I worry about this whole concept.

823
00:55:00,303 --> 00:55:02,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, at least to... Why not like a little spin-off story?

824
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:05,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Do some slightly different dungeons and do like a spin-off story.

825
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:08,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a lot more... Yeah.

826
00:55:08,649 --> 00:55:09,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Well... Wantable.

827
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's... It's interesting, but I don't know.

828
00:55:15,474 --> 00:55:16,755
[SPEAKER_07]: The game itself looks pretty.

829
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:19,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not as good as, obviously, the 360 one, but...

830
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it looks okay.

831
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:29,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And like you mentioned, cutting out skills and stuff, 18 of the original game's 21 skills are going to be in the game.

832
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:31,710
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of them stripped out.

833
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's basically... Why don't they just release a 3D version of Diablo?

834
00:55:37,911 --> 00:55:43,492
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like what this game is almost like, where you pick up items and just kind of grind at it.

835
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:46,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure Diablo 3 will be something we're hearing about in 2007.

836
00:55:46,193 --> 00:55:48,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my thought.

837
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:52,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear I have not been ignoring you, chat room, over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

838
00:55:52,674 --> 00:55:53,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on chat.

839
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:56,317
[SPEAKER_06]: My mind just got distracted with trying to set up that game and everything a little bit ago.

840
00:55:56,638 --> 00:56:00,941
[SPEAKER_06]: But it looks like Bobby Blackwolf is actually campaigning right now to be the voice of Sony.

841
00:56:01,462 --> 00:56:03,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So he'll get up there and be the voice of Sony.

842
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:07,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send you some Crayolas, Blackwolf, so you can start practicing.

843
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:10,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And then DMN follows up with, Nokia needs Bobby Blackwolf.

844
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,752
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the N-Gage needs a spokesman, too.

845
00:56:14,092 --> 00:56:16,094
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem with this, I mean, they...

846
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:23,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I really have trouble with them pushing games like the Eye of Judgment because it's going to take an elaborate setup to get to work.

847
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:26,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be honest, the Eye Toy didn't work all that great.

848
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:44,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a lot of the games that are coming out at launch, like Resistance, okay, it's a first-person shooter that takes place during World War II, which also happens to come out at the same time as Call of Duty 3, which is a first-person shooter that takes place during World War II, granted one's sci-fi, I mean, whatever.

849
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Riding Game, Eragon, MotorStorm, EA Sports Games

850
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:09,127
[SPEAKER_07]: and Carbon.

851
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:11,068
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you first speak Carbon, which is actually a pretty cool game.

852
00:57:11,088 --> 00:57:11,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Play the demo.

853
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then the 2K sports games.

854
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:20,530
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, as far as exclusive titles, I mean, there's not a whole lot.

855
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:28,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, I think that's really gonna hurt them more than the fact that the console's three, you know, fucking expensive and that there's not that many units out there.

856
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:37,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's, you know, people that are, like, actually gonna want, I mean, there'll be people that pick up the console, but a lot of people are like, well, I'm just gonna wait until some more games come out.

857
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:38,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

858
00:57:39,043 --> 00:57:41,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony fans, if you feel differently, send Loki an email.

859
00:57:41,485 --> 00:57:47,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orange.radio.com Meanwhile, let's move on to something for the Nintendo fans, and this is a little bit more disappointment.

860
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:51,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we already heard about the consoles are definitely going to be region locked.

861
00:57:51,152 --> 00:57:51,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?

862
00:57:52,533 --> 00:58:00,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Eurogamer talked to a Nintendo UK spokesperson, and they confirmed that the Wii Virtual Console games will also be region locked.

863
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,722
[SPEAKER_06]: The Virtual Console games will also not be universal.

864
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:06,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play the original Metal Gear or Gartic Metal Gear here

865
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:34,551
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but the old school MSX, it was on the MSX before it was on the NES.

866
00:58:35,252 --> 00:58:42,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and the true sequel to Metal Gear was not Snake's Revenge, but the true sequel to Metal Gear was only on the MSX.

867
00:58:42,697 --> 00:58:47,300
[SPEAKER_06]: But I get, well, they had the whole PlayStation 2 secret thing, but whatever, I want it on the virtual console.

868
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:48,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Gimme.

869
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,102
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I sound depressed, sorry.

870
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:57,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not too worried about it, I mean, big deal, I didn't play a lot of the import games on the NES, and whatever, I mean...

871
00:58:58,086 --> 00:59:00,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like they were going to put all the games on there anyways.

872
00:59:00,729 --> 00:59:05,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so, you know, do I really need a Japanese version of Zelda on there?

873
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:05,614
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

874
00:59:05,894 --> 00:59:09,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma speculates maybe you can get a Japanese Wii Connect 24 account.

875
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:12,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackboy says he was looking forward to Doki Doki.

876
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:13,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

877
00:59:13,662 --> 00:59:15,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Doki Doki Panic, the inspiration for Super Mario Bros.

878
00:59:15,744 --> 00:59:15,684
2.

879
00:59:15,784 --> 00:59:16,264
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

880
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:19,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, well, the consoles themselves are probably region locked, but I'm sure you could probably like...

881
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:22,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Disable it or change that to something else, you know?

882
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:26,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's very easy to get a Japanese Xbox 360 account, so maybe that same logic.

883
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:29,146
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, it's hard to pay for that, you know what I mean?

884
00:59:29,606 --> 00:59:36,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you can't really... Like, you only get the Japanese account so you can download their free demos and trailers, but you can't, you know, buy things on their store, really.

885
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:39,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, luckily that there's no real money involved.

886
00:59:39,727 --> 00:59:44,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically the Nintendo points cards, or points, and you know what?

887
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:45,268
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still do that.

888
00:59:45,668 --> 00:59:47,469
[SPEAKER_07]: But what if the points cards are region locked?

889
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:48,009
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

890
00:59:48,029 --> 00:59:48,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Only the American...

891
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,447
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the points cards are just universal.

892
00:59:50,968 --> 01:00:02,436
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's interesting, though, see, like, there is going to be some Xbox Live games that are exclusive to Japan, and I was going to buy them on my one account because you can actually play them on your, you know, US account, too.

893
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:07,420
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would download the demo on my Japanese account and register them on my US account.

894
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:11,218
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 says, I want the Famicom version of Gradius 2.

895
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: See, all these great games that really didn't ever come over here.

896
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:18,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nintendo, I think you ought to reconsider this.

897
01:00:18,465 --> 01:00:22,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least, if you're going to do this, please give the U.S.

898
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,952
[SPEAKER_06]: gamers a shot at some of these games they never played.

899
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:26,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet there's, you know, money to be made there.

900
01:00:26,754 --> 01:00:29,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think a lot of this, though, is going to be to eliminate confusion.

901
01:00:29,276 --> 01:00:31,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you're a normal consumer out there...

902
01:00:32,772 --> 01:00:38,695
[SPEAKER_07]: What if you don't want to download the Japanese version of a certain game and you might accidentally do that and then you've wasted your money on it?

903
01:00:38,715 --> 01:00:40,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, mark it very clearly.

904
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:48,761
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no amount of clear marketing that's going to stop stupid people from injuring themselves or downloading something they shouldn't be.

905
01:00:48,901 --> 01:00:49,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm done being emo.

906
01:00:50,962 --> 01:00:53,423
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing more you can do, but whatever.

907
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Some interesting stuff, though.

908
01:00:56,085 --> 01:01:01,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Reggie over in Tendo there is contradicting some of the info we've gotten about the pricing for the

909
01:01:03,734 --> 01:01:05,515
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the web browser for the Wii.

910
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:14,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, his comments were basically, in fairness for the Americas, we haven't made the business decision for how and what we're going to do with the browser.

911
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,201
[SPEAKER_07]: We recognize for most people, browser is pretty standard.

912
01:01:17,221 --> 01:01:22,343
[SPEAKER_07]: The concept of charging a significant amount of Wii points to get the browser is somewhat challenging.

913
01:01:22,743 --> 01:01:23,844
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to work through that.

914
01:01:24,684 --> 01:01:28,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So, basically saying, you know, we haven't announced anything yet about it.

915
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,261
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

916
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:56,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Wemo is an expensive piece of equipment.

917
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:57,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what, like $50?

918
01:01:58,062 --> 01:01:57,522
$40?

919
01:01:58,342 --> 01:02:00,483
[SPEAKER_06]: $50 it's retailing for?

920
01:02:00,503 --> 01:02:00,483
$39.99.

921
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:09,606
[SPEAKER_06]: $39.99.

922
01:02:01,643 --> 01:02:09,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very interesting that a third party is going to jump in and try to make their own version of the Wemo, but usually third party controllers aren't quite as good as first party.

923
01:02:09,946 --> 01:02:14,908
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I kind of go, uh-oh, if I were Nintendo, I'd be concerned about this because this is kind of like market saturation, isn't it?

924
01:02:14,928 --> 01:02:16,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're the ones that have to approve it.

925
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:17,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

926
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:19,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it won't come out right away.

927
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:20,790
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.

928
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

929
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:24,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, but...

930
01:02:25,521 --> 01:02:28,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo will sue!

931
01:02:38,317 --> 01:02:47,343
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some controversy now, it's about the dumbest things too, about the light on the front of the Wii surrounding the disk drive, whether it's going to be on or off.

932
01:02:47,824 --> 01:02:54,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And during the Nintendo Fusion Tour, there's actually, the light was completely turned off.

933
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:57,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people are like, well, hey, I want my light on, what the hell?

934
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So, here's my theory on this whole thing.

935
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what they've come out and said, the rep,

936
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:11,171
[SPEAKER_07]: was that the light's only going to be on when you put a disc in or when you turn the console on and that it's going to turn off later on.

937
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:20,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's either going to be an option to keep it on or the fact that probably those games that you were playing weren't running on that Wii.

938
01:03:20,576 --> 01:03:26,180
[SPEAKER_07]: They were probably running on a dev kit that was below the Wii and that the system just wasn't plugged in.

939
01:03:27,313 --> 01:03:31,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I was going to say, when we went to the Konami thing, didn't we see Elebits?

940
01:03:31,536 --> 01:03:32,937
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing was glowing the whole time?

941
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:33,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

942
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:35,859
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, that same logic could apply.

943
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:36,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have been hooked up to a dev kit.

944
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean shit.

945
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:43,244
[SPEAKER_07]: And they could have just had the console plugged in and turned on and so the light glows.

946
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:47,607
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's hooked, you're actually playing off of a dev kit and not the actual system.

947
01:03:47,747 --> 01:03:55,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, in theory, you could just, if you're limited on plugs or whatever for power, you could just not plug that in and just set that there because...

948
01:03:56,018 --> 01:03:57,259
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

949
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:40,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or you can always pick up the phone and call us 916-226-9067 Can't remember if I mentioned it last week but there is an 800 number coming soon because the number we have now is not toll free but by the end of the month we're going to have a toll free number which is very exciting.

950
01:04:40,865 --> 01:04:42,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very much looking forward to that.

951
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:45,034
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we'll have a lot more folks wanting to call in, I'm sure.

952
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:53,559
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably bring back voicemails of the week at that point because we think more of you guys might want to contribute if you have a toll-free number to use because most of you are just too lazy for Skype, I guess.

953
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:54,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

954
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

955
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

956
01:04:57,861 --> 01:04:58,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, it's Ranma.

957
01:04:58,521 --> 01:04:59,021
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, guys?

958
01:04:59,181 --> 01:04:59,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Ranma.

959
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:00,102
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

960
01:05:00,122 --> 01:05:00,602
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

961
01:05:01,503 --> 01:05:02,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much, not much.

962
01:05:02,703 --> 01:05:07,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to record the last part of the show so I just got back from another anime convention.

963
01:05:08,126 --> 01:05:09,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Another anime convention?

964
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:10,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one this time?

965
01:05:11,228 --> 01:05:11,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Manga...

966
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:16,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing but a convention about mangas and fans and stuff like that.

967
01:05:16,493 --> 01:05:17,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So no video games?

968
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:26,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there were no tournaments, but let's just say older gamers like us would have cried tears of joy at the games that were there.

969
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,160
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they bring?

970
01:05:29,421 --> 01:05:32,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we saw a working Nintendo set up with Super Mario Bros.

971
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:32,563
3.

972
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:33,563
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty hot.

973
01:05:33,603 --> 01:05:34,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they have Guardian Legend?

974
01:05:35,685 --> 01:05:36,705
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they didn't have that.

975
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:39,527
[SPEAKER_02]: The older guy that ran the game told them next year.

976
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that works for me.

977
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:44,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to share about the con?

978
01:05:44,391 --> 01:05:44,711
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?

979
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:51,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun, and it was basically drama-free, because everybody just had to have a good time.

980
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody bashing Orange Moms Radio to you this year?

981
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:57,619
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not this year, not this year.

982
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,703
[SPEAKER_06]: We love our anime fans that go to the conventions and then bash us to other people.

983
01:06:03,763 --> 01:06:04,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That's lovely.

984
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:06,064
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just teasing.

985
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool, whatever, you know.

986
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:11,174
[SPEAKER_06]: People have their varying opinions.

987
01:06:11,194 --> 01:06:13,835
[SPEAKER_06]: There's about 500 video game podcasts out there.

988
01:06:13,855 --> 01:06:15,456
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't like this one, go find another one.

989
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:17,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep it independent is all we ask.

990
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:19,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

991
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:20,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

992
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:21,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything else you want to share?

993
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:31,385
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a few Super Nintendo set up, a couple of Playstations, and yes, there was Guitar Hero on the big screen.

994
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:32,726
[SPEAKER_02]: There was what?

995
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero on the big screen.

996
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:37,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Guitar Hero on the big screen.

997
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:37,949
[SPEAKER_06]: How did that go over?

998
01:06:38,936 --> 01:06:39,796
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty nice.

999
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:45,079
[SPEAKER_02]: That and DDR Extreme 2 were like the top, part of the top five.

1000
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:50,662
[SPEAKER_02]: You also had Not Ultimate Hero 4 and Battle Station DLN are also popular.

1001
01:06:51,763 --> 01:06:51,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1002
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:53,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1003
01:06:53,364 --> 01:06:53,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Well.

1004
01:06:54,565 --> 01:06:56,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, okay?

1005
01:06:57,486 --> 01:06:57,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

1006
01:06:58,007 --> 01:07:02,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one and we hope for some more old school gaming goodness at the next con.

1007
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:03,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn right.

1008
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:04,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1009
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1010
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:04,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1011
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:07,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.

1012
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1013
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1014
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is El Mullet calling.

1015
01:07:12,392 --> 01:07:14,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we remember you.

1016
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,132
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't called into this show in a long time.

1017
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:17,033
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, El Mullet?

1018
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:18,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I am doing just fine, Sky.

1019
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:19,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing just fine.

1020
01:07:19,913 --> 01:07:21,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever called into the podcast?

1021
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:22,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1022
01:07:22,654 --> 01:07:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is my first podcast call.

1023
01:07:24,754 --> 01:07:25,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Your podcast debut.

1024
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:28,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you used to listen to the three-hour show back in the day.

1025
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:29,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.

1026
01:07:29,395 --> 01:07:30,535
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun times.

1027
01:07:30,575 --> 01:07:32,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, from what I mean, yeah, crazy random times.

1028
01:07:32,656 --> 01:07:33,136
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's great.

1029
01:07:33,336 --> 01:07:34,556
[SPEAKER_06]: We love our history.

1030
01:07:35,366 --> 01:07:37,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you're getting married next week, right?

1031
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:38,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am.

1032
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:39,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am.

1033
01:07:39,508 --> 01:07:40,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

1034
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:42,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Is she a gamer?

1035
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly.

1036
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I am learning her.

1037
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:46,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1038
01:07:46,231 --> 01:07:46,491
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1039
01:07:46,831 --> 01:07:47,252
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

1040
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:49,573
[SPEAKER_06]: There's got to be compromise in a relationship, right, Loki?

1041
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:50,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Loki?

1042
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,374
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mostly DS playing.

1043
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:55,475
[SPEAKER_00]: We do New Super Mario Bros.

1044
01:07:55,515 --> 01:07:57,796
[SPEAKER_00]: vs. We do Tetris vs. Okay.

1045
01:07:58,316 --> 01:07:58,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's cool.

1046
01:07:59,117 --> 01:07:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1047
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:01,258
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you want to call in about tonight?

1048
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:01,538
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1049
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:03,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm basically wanting to say hi.

1050
01:08:03,605 --> 01:08:04,266
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while.

1051
01:08:04,806 --> 01:08:05,487
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your hand.

1052
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you still doing your column over at Inside Pulse?

1053
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:13,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I've quote-unquote left Inside Pulse.

1054
01:08:13,274 --> 01:08:15,676
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just been a lot of stuff going on.

1055
01:08:15,696 --> 01:08:16,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.

1056
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:18,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find work.

1057
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:20,300
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously the marriage thing.

1058
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, things have just been...

1059
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:29,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of stuff has been going on, and I've been trying to catch up on everything.

1060
01:08:29,362 --> 01:08:30,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

1061
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:32,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Lives go through chaos sometimes.

1062
01:08:32,243 --> 01:08:33,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fully understandable.

1063
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:35,083
[SPEAKER_06]: What games have you been playing recently?

1064
01:08:35,103 --> 01:08:36,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you check out DDR Supernova?

1065
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:37,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.

1066
01:08:38,004 --> 01:08:39,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having a blast with that game.

1067
01:08:39,584 --> 01:08:45,785
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few songs I could have done without, but I like the setup of Stellar Master Mode.

1068
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:49,366
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the fact... I think it's the best...

1069
01:08:52,397 --> 01:08:52,898
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word?

1070
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Console licenses.

1071
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:59,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the best lineup thus far, especially songs like The Other Side, Turn Up the Music.

1072
01:09:00,551 --> 01:09:00,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

1073
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:09,310
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you think the game compares to the other PlayStation 2 releases that are out there?

1074
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's kind of interesting.

1075
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:16,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just at Target the other day, and they had a DDR Supernova bundle right next to Extreme 2 bundles they still hadn't sold.

1076
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:23,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely options are still available to the new DDR folks that want to get on board with this.

1077
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:24,795
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you think it compares to the other ones?

1078
01:09:26,257 --> 01:09:33,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I definitely think that it's definitely on par with Extreme 2 as far as best US PS2 mix.

1079
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,923
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely stuff in there that make me go, wow, this is much better.

1080
01:09:40,183 --> 01:09:43,745
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there are other things that make me go, hey, it was better in Extreme 2.

1081
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:48,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think the chorus mode, we got shafted with chorus mode this time.

1082
01:09:49,862 --> 01:09:57,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's only one difficulty level on everything, whereas last game, you had two difficulty levels on everything.

1083
01:09:57,615 --> 01:09:58,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1084
01:09:58,516 --> 01:10:01,501
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about how the new Xbox games are shaping up?

1085
01:10:02,169 --> 01:10:03,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're shaping up really well.

1086
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:07,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Your podcasts are definitely making them more favorable by the day.

1087
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:08,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

1088
01:10:09,431 --> 01:10:10,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let Konami know you said that.

1089
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:19,253
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously though, if you were still reviewing games for the website, how many stars out of 10 would you be giving DDR Supernova?

1090
01:10:20,013 --> 01:10:23,854
[SPEAKER_00]: DDR Supernova, well, that would be under the 10 category review system.

1091
01:10:24,174 --> 01:10:29,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave Extreme 2 a 7.5 and said that was the best one ever.

1092
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:34,151
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like a 9.0 on other websites.

1093
01:10:34,572 --> 01:10:46,061
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that Supernova would range between a 7.0, 7.5 because there's stuff that's better and there's stuff that's worse.

1094
01:10:47,302 --> 01:10:49,323
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be around the same score, I would think.

1095
01:10:49,484 --> 01:10:50,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what's up with that?

1096
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:58,791
[SPEAKER_06]: You brought up an interesting point is that a 7.5, the way you would review games, and if I wrote game reviews, I would hope I would be very similar as well where like, you know, an

1097
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:02,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Average game gets an average score in the middle.

1098
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:06,725
[SPEAKER_06]: But it seems like most game websites, you're right, kind of skew it towards the high end.

1099
01:11:06,765 --> 01:11:08,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what I get.

1100
01:11:08,386 --> 01:11:19,212
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, games that are reviewed on IGN, they'll have a score for each category and then a score that doesn't have anything to do with any category on there.

1101
01:11:19,272 --> 01:11:27,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for example, a game might score seven fives across the board on all the other categories and get a six overall.

1102
01:11:27,237 --> 01:11:27,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like,

1103
01:11:28,018 --> 01:11:29,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how the hell is that average out?

1104
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I'm thinking about like on Rotten Tomatoes, like, you know, because they cover game reviews.

1105
01:11:33,281 --> 01:11:43,687
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do it quite as well as they do movies, but it says we only give a fresh rating if the site gave it a 7 or better because of the skewed, you know, people tend to give higher scores on game reviews.

1106
01:11:44,187 --> 01:11:45,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think that is, Emily?

1107
01:11:45,108 --> 01:11:45,448
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is...

1108
01:11:46,388 --> 01:11:55,772
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that so many of these numbers are pulled directly out of their asses, and most of these numbers don't even correspond to what the written opinions are on the game.

1109
01:11:55,812 --> 01:12:03,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 7.0s on some sites, on some game reviews, and the bottom line is, don't play this.

1110
01:12:05,815 --> 01:12:08,216
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way that Inside Pulse reviews games.

1111
01:12:08,536 --> 01:12:10,457
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of a 10-category system.

1112
01:12:12,531 --> 01:12:17,995
[SPEAKER_00]: and it could really excel in some areas, but there are other areas that could bring the game down.

1113
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:21,057
[SPEAKER_00]: A game could have a great story, but horrible graphics and sound.

1114
01:12:21,077 --> 01:12:25,881
[SPEAKER_00]: The game could have great gameplay mechanics, but it can only be fun for the first three hours.

1115
01:12:28,923 --> 01:12:34,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the games have to be really awesome in all categories to get 8 and above.

1116
01:12:35,007 --> 01:12:37,309
[SPEAKER_00]: But a game can be worth playing at a 7 or even a 6.

1117
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:40,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, yeah, that's true.

1118
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:52,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I hope to see that you come back to the internet soon reviewing games and sticking to the more realistic scale that you started over there.

1119
01:12:53,309 --> 01:12:58,031
[SPEAKER_00]: You just might see a Supernova review before the end of the week, assuming I have enough time.

1120
01:12:58,271 --> 01:12:58,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1121
01:12:59,192 --> 01:13:02,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Elmoled, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for calling in.

1122
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:03,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1123
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:04,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, buddy.

1124
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:04,835
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

1125
01:13:04,975 --> 01:13:05,495
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, bye-bye.

1126
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:06,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1127
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,157
[SPEAKER_06]: How exciting, a wedding, getting married and all that fun stuff.

1128
01:13:09,197 --> 01:13:09,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

1129
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1130
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:12,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1131
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:15,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Ultimate Gamer from Chad.

1132
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:17,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm currently not in chat right now.

1133
01:13:17,484 --> 01:13:18,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, hello, Ultimate Gamer.

1134
01:13:18,904 --> 01:13:19,605
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1135
01:13:20,906 --> 01:13:24,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I'm just, uh, thinking about the Xbox 360.

1136
01:13:24,147 --> 01:13:27,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it has a $200 HD DVD drive.

1137
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:36,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, uh, like, am I just gonna have to, like, should I just get a PS3?

1138
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:46,719
[SPEAKER_05]: because since the Blu-ray drive is implemented into the PS3 and games are actually on Blu-ray discs.

1139
01:13:46,879 --> 01:13:47,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

1140
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:47,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I see.

1141
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,440
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where you're going.

1142
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though.

1143
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:55,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you interested in just playing movies with this device, or are you going to be playing games as well?

1144
01:13:57,103 --> 01:14:04,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm mostly getting the PS3 for games, but I know the Xbox 360 has some good games.

1145
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:04,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1146
01:14:05,046 --> 01:14:07,087
[SPEAKER_05]: The PS3s are actually on Blu-ray discs.

1147
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:12,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it really boils down to, you know, which console has the games that you want.

1148
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:21,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, Microsoft gets a lot of heat usually because they overlook, or at least they have in the past, they don't have a lot of solid role-playing type games.

1149
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,927
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have a lot of solid action games.

1150
01:14:22,947 --> 01:14:29,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've been trying to correct that, you know, you got Blue Dragon coming out and they, you know, they had Cameo, take that for whatever it's worth.

1151
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:32,372
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, Sony's always kind of excelled in that range.

1152
01:14:32,657 --> 01:14:36,480
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the flip side, Sony doesn't seem to have a strong lineup right now.

1153
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to kind of look more into the future at what Sony's got.

1154
01:14:39,482 --> 01:14:42,164
[SPEAKER_06]: And Microsoft is trying to correct themselves.

1155
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:43,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And you kind of saw that with Tokyo Game Show.

1156
01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:46,267
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to take a more broad approach to different games.

1157
01:14:46,568 --> 01:14:51,191
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really have to ask yourself, which of these two systems is going to have the games I want to play?

1158
01:14:51,471 --> 01:14:55,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember what we always say, the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1159
01:14:56,255 --> 01:14:59,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it comes down to the whole... I guess here's another question I have for you.

1160
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:01,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does the we stand in your mind?

1161
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you not care about the Wii?

1162
01:15:21,277 --> 01:15:29,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say take that same logic and put it on Xbox 360 versus PlayStation 3 because it's not really going to matter, you know, Blu-ray, HD, DVD, whatever.

1163
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:30,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be really about the games in the end.

1164
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:31,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be honest.

1165
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen Blu-ray and HD, DVD side by side.

1166
01:15:34,093 --> 01:15:35,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really not that much different.

1167
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:38,619
[SPEAKER_06]: The spec-wise, they're about the same, too, other than data.

1168
01:15:39,119 --> 01:16:01,294
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do understand what you're saying, is that Sony, and I do agree, this could be to their advantage in three years, is that Sony has the native Blu-ray support for the games, and while right now it's causing the system to cost your firstborn child, later on, when we get further down within the subdivisions of this generation, that could really benefit them in the end.

1169
01:16:01,834 --> 01:16:01,954
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360

1170
01:16:16,718 --> 01:16:20,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, you know, having an HDTV will make the game high definition.

1171
01:16:20,502 --> 01:16:21,243
[SPEAKER_06]: True, that's true.

1172
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:28,350
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, don't forget the other part I'm trying to say here is that, you know, doesn't it boil down to how good the games are, though?

1173
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:33,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily how they look, because, you know, being on Blu-ray, certainly they're going to look better.

1174
01:16:33,475 --> 01:16:38,881
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to buy a Wii, then you must already be into that school of thought that it really is about the fun games.

1175
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:53,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And granted that Blu-ray does have more storage available to it, doesn't mean though that they'll use it all, and also doesn't mean that the games that are on DVD-9s are going to look any less brilliant than, say, a PlayStation 3 game.

1176
01:16:53,229 --> 01:16:54,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Gears of War and Resistance.

1177
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:55,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect example.

1178
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,812
[SPEAKER_07]: They both look very good, and

1179
01:16:58,211 --> 01:16:58,912
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1180
01:17:23,311 --> 01:17:26,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just messing with you, but, you know, I know you're probably right now.

1181
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:29,839
[SPEAKER_06]: You want one this year, and maybe you'll get the other one next year?

1182
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:31,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1183
01:17:31,962 --> 01:17:33,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm getting the Wii first.

1184
01:17:33,343 --> 01:17:42,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, PS3, I get a couple months down the road, but, you know, I think, you know, the games, they should be like, you know,

1185
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:46,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I think... But also good graphics.

1186
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:46,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1187
01:17:46,811 --> 01:17:47,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1188
01:17:47,431 --> 01:17:48,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're on the right track then.

1189
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:59,720
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if the Wii is... It sounds like you really, really, really want the Wii, you know, then go for that, buy that, and then when you have enough money saved up for a second console, look at the games that are out and or coming out and make your decision at that time.

1190
01:18:00,581 --> 01:18:00,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1191
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:01,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1192
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:01,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1193
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:05,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, really love the show, and great RSS feed.

1194
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:09,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to it on my PSP every week, and I get no buffering signs or anything.

1195
01:18:09,814 --> 01:18:10,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

1196
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:15,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear there's people still using OLRPSP.com, so Loki, go update it.

1197
01:18:16,037 --> 01:18:16,397
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1198
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:17,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1199
01:18:17,378 --> 01:18:17,978
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1200
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:27,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I know sometimes we give the PSP a hard time on this show, but it is a great multimedia, multi-platform system, and we're really glad to be able to offer our podcast on it.

1201
01:18:28,923 --> 01:18:29,183
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1202
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:30,103
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

1203
01:18:30,804 --> 01:18:31,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

1204
01:18:31,104 --> 01:18:31,604
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, bye-bye.

1205
01:18:32,193 --> 01:18:32,933
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good call.

1206
01:18:33,954 --> 01:18:35,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to another call here.

1207
01:18:36,655 --> 01:18:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1208
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:38,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1209
01:18:40,836 --> 01:18:44,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh... Oh, I... Am I on?

1210
01:18:45,218 --> 01:18:45,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you are.

1211
01:18:46,038 --> 01:18:48,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry about that.

1212
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:49,379
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Legend of Zakum.

1213
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:50,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, buddy.

1214
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,400
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1215
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Digital Lice next week.

1216
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:56,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it is, and I'm not going... I'm missing it by a week.

1217
01:18:57,342 --> 01:18:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's... Wait, wasn't it this week?

1218
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,861
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1219
01:19:25,029 --> 01:19:32,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Nintendo's doing a lot of good things with the Wii, but then all the good things end up turning up sour, you know, when you really think about it.

1220
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:38,973
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole having to lock down, you know, region, regioning on, you know, the games and the virtual console.

1221
01:19:39,593 --> 01:19:41,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that going to hurt them in the long run?

1222
01:19:42,094 --> 01:19:46,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I agree it sucks and all, but, you know, the NES was region locked too.

1223
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:51,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that was easy to get, you know, it wasn't as hard.

1224
01:19:51,757 --> 01:19:52,377
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Zen.

1225
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:57,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, when you have the PS3 being region free, couldn't they just compete on that?

1226
01:19:59,492 --> 01:20:01,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta be honest with you.

1227
01:20:01,973 --> 01:20:09,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the folks that listen to this show because the way myself, Loki, and DarkSakura are is that we are focused a lot on import gaming.

1228
01:20:10,257 --> 01:20:13,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really do enjoy a lot of the games that come over here from Japan.

1229
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:18,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So from our perspective, yeah, it's really fucked up that Nintendo's not supporting the region.

1230
01:20:19,302 --> 01:20:23,504
[SPEAKER_10]: If you had a single version of a game without having to do any porting,

1231
01:20:25,974 --> 01:20:35,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Any extra work in trying to localize it to a particular country, you know, rather doing the language as a first time, would that make more sense than just releasing one copy?

1232
01:20:36,321 --> 01:20:39,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a lot of work, though, because you have to do all those different languages and things.

1233
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:47,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if it's got to have French for parts of Canada, Japanese... But that's, you know, but just keeping that in the single source.

1234
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:53,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, but here's... Okay, here's my other question for you would be then...

1235
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:05,029
[SPEAKER_06]: About the Wii, what about the greater gamer culture out there besides just us, the rabid import gamers?

1236
01:21:05,049 --> 01:21:07,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they going to give a shit?

1237
01:21:07,511 --> 01:21:10,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Casual gamers won't give a crap about what we're bitching about.

1238
01:21:11,415 --> 01:21:12,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's a fact.

1239
01:21:13,316 --> 01:21:15,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Casual gamers just want to play, period.

1240
01:21:16,059 --> 01:21:20,263
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what the Wii does is gives them that opportunity to just play.

1241
01:21:20,894 --> 01:21:23,255
[SPEAKER_10]: which is basically Nintendo's banking on right now.

1242
01:21:23,355 --> 01:21:28,757
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just banking on the casual gamers to pretty much dominate this holiday season.

1243
01:21:28,898 --> 01:21:32,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So my question is, in the big picture, will it really make a difference that they've region locked out?

1244
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

1245
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:41,603
[SPEAKER_10]: It would affect some, but then Nintendo wouldn't care because our niche minority is not their bottom line.

1246
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:44,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Their bottom line is about everyone, the casual gamer included.

1247
01:21:45,665 --> 01:21:45,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1248
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:48,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting comment in our chatroom.

1249
01:21:48,814 --> 01:21:50,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Ari Massen says, I'm a large importer.

1250
01:21:50,856 --> 01:21:54,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I might buy two Wii's just to play both Japanese and American games.

1251
01:21:54,338 --> 01:21:56,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Nintendo just won off you.

1252
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's basically what people did when the PS2 first came out.

1253
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:00,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I did.

1254
01:22:00,902 --> 01:22:03,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Sony made it twice off me, so whatever.

1255
01:22:03,784 --> 01:22:05,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, who knows?

1256
01:22:05,705 --> 01:22:09,387
[SPEAKER_10]: There might be a way to just crack the Wii like they did with the GameCube to play imports.

1257
01:22:09,628 --> 01:22:10,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see.

1258
01:22:10,448 --> 01:22:12,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you've got to give those opportunities time.

1259
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:13,010
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1260
01:22:15,586 --> 01:22:17,507
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Zach, any other thoughts for our listeners?

1261
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:24,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, New York people, Digital Life, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1262
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:28,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's a good meet-up spot at Digital Life?

1263
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:30,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, I'm not really sure.

1264
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe in the front lobby of the Javits Center.

1265
01:22:33,273 --> 01:22:37,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe inside the DDR tournament area.

1266
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:42,537
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so Orange Loungers, be at the DDR machine Saturday at noon.

1267
01:22:44,318 --> 01:22:44,598
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1268
01:22:45,506 --> 01:22:46,447
[SPEAKER_06]: The OLR meetup.

1269
01:22:47,388 --> 01:22:51,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the OLR meetup right there with the DDR tournament.

1270
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:51,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1271
01:22:52,011 --> 01:22:52,871
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Saturday at noon.

1272
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:53,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, have fun.

1273
01:22:53,732 --> 01:22:54,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Be there.

1274
01:22:54,873 --> 01:22:55,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1275
01:22:55,133 --> 01:22:55,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later, Saku.

1276
01:22:56,594 --> 01:22:56,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1277
01:22:56,934 --> 01:22:57,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1278
01:22:58,055 --> 01:22:58,755
[SPEAKER_06]: One more call.

1279
01:23:00,316 --> 01:23:00,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Last call.

1280
01:23:00,877 --> 01:23:01,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1281
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:02,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1282
01:23:03,038 --> 01:23:03,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It's DMN.

1283
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:04,159
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, guys?

1284
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:05,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Goddamn, you get through every week.

1285
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:08,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and I keep paying you, you know.

1286
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:09,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, what's up, DMN?

1287
01:23:10,795 --> 01:23:15,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually calling with a... Well, now having heard that last call, I have something else.

1288
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:19,438
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first thing is a little brief review of Clubhouse Games for the DS.

1289
01:23:19,959 --> 01:23:21,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Clubhouse Games.

1290
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:24,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally forgot about this game until somebody was talking about it in chat earlier.

1291
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, the only reason I want to get this game is because you can PictoChat over the internet.

1292
01:23:28,142 --> 01:23:28,762
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can't.

1293
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:29,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fuck.

1294
01:23:30,123 --> 01:23:30,423
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1295
01:23:30,443 --> 01:23:31,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not buying it.

1296
01:23:31,623 --> 01:23:32,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, Nintendo.

1297
01:23:32,363 --> 01:23:33,144
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you get.

1298
01:23:35,565 --> 01:23:38,106
[SPEAKER_03]: You can PictoChat over local Wi-Fi while you're playing.

1299
01:23:38,126 --> 01:23:39,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can do that already.

1300
01:23:39,844 --> 01:23:42,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can't do PictoChat while you're playing a game, though.

1301
01:23:42,646 --> 01:23:44,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do it while I'm playing Ping Pals.

1302
01:23:45,069 --> 01:23:47,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry you bought that.

1303
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:48,351
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was a gift.

1304
01:23:48,872 --> 01:23:52,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very nice gift, but fuck that game, seriously.

1305
01:23:52,315 --> 01:23:53,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry that that was bought for you.

1306
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:57,579
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like, no, no, no, I mean, it was a very sweet person that gave it to me.

1307
01:23:57,599 --> 01:24:01,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying anything negative about the game, but seriously, it was like getting a fruitcake for Christmas, okay?

1308
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:06,847
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Grandma loves you, but you got a damn fruitcake.

1309
01:24:08,686 --> 01:24:11,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, Clubhouse Games is really cool.

1310
01:24:11,108 --> 01:24:19,173
[SPEAKER_03]: What's really awesome about it is, with the Wi-Fi mode, you can play all of the multiplayer games online, which is like about 36, I think, when I come back to it.

1311
01:24:20,093 --> 01:24:21,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, see, that's cool to me.

1312
01:24:21,994 --> 01:24:26,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's great because I'm a casual gamer as well as a hardcore gamer.

1313
01:24:26,137 --> 01:24:27,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I love playing, like, Checkers, Chess, whatever.

1314
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:33,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is fun for me because I can play with my friends all around the world, and at the same time, it's games I know how to play.

1315
01:24:34,929 --> 01:24:35,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1316
01:24:35,549 --> 01:24:40,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what other kind of like features does this have kind of souped up with the games?

1317
01:24:40,332 --> 01:24:45,936
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's like 30 some odd games, which I suppose is a big selling point, but what are some other features that might sell this game to people?

1318
01:24:47,197 --> 01:24:53,160
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that it's under the Touch Generations label, which is Nintendo's label for games anyone can pick up and play.

1319
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:58,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could... Sorry, lost in thought there.

1320
01:24:59,424 --> 01:25:02,686
[SPEAKER_03]: You could pick up anything on this and immediately want to play it.

1321
01:25:03,727 --> 01:25:03,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1322
01:25:04,847 --> 01:25:06,468
[SPEAKER_03]: and from what I hear, it might be affordable.

1323
01:25:06,508 --> 01:25:09,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear it might retail at the very most expensive $29.99.

1324
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:11,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, interesting.

1325
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:13,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you know how much that's retailing for?

1326
01:25:14,073 --> 01:25:14,794
[SPEAKER_07]: What thing?

1327
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:15,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Clubhouse games?

1328
01:25:15,454 --> 01:25:16,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how much that's going for?

1329
01:25:16,775 --> 01:25:19,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say $19.99 or something.

1330
01:25:19,817 --> 01:25:20,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1331
01:25:20,538 --> 01:25:21,778
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really good deal if that's true.

1332
01:25:22,499 --> 01:25:23,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember off the top of my head.

1333
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,901
[SPEAKER_07]: If you give me a second, I can check.

1334
01:25:26,161 --> 01:25:27,102
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, you do that.

1335
01:25:27,742 --> 01:25:29,424
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did you want to say, DMN, while he's checking?

1336
01:25:29,444 --> 01:25:32,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now hearing about that whole Wii region lock...

1337
01:25:33,522 --> 01:25:40,286
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be very possible that sometime down the road Nintendo could release a firmware update to eliminate that issue.

1338
01:25:41,727 --> 01:25:42,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would they do that?

1339
01:25:43,508 --> 01:25:43,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1340
01:25:44,909 --> 01:25:51,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps maybe Nintendo will realize the error of their ways sometime down the road and be like, oh, hey, these people want to play our Japanese titles.

1341
01:25:52,193 --> 01:25:57,416
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't ignore the fact that Oh and Don was one of the most imported games of 2006.

1342
01:25:57,496 --> 01:25:57,636
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

1343
01:26:01,024 --> 01:26:04,386
[SPEAKER_03]: and they said, okay, fine, we're going to give you Elite Beat Agents.

1344
01:26:05,107 --> 01:26:09,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's an Owen Don game coming out for the Wii, I want it.

1345
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:15,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to have to buy another Wii or crack my Wii open to play it on my American console.

1346
01:26:16,014 --> 01:26:20,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally understand what you're saying because it's as cool as Elite Beat Agents might be, it's not Owen Don.

1347
01:26:20,477 --> 01:26:24,740
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same song list which in a music game is everything.

1348
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:25,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1349
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:26,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1350
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:32,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what DarkTetsuya agrees in chat right there, but Elite Beat Agents is an entirely different game.

1351
01:26:33,327 --> 01:26:34,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, did you find the answer, Loki?

1352
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:36,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

1353
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,470
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1354
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:37,470
$29.99.

1355
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:38,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah.

1356
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:39,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Blast.

1357
01:26:40,192 --> 01:26:42,634
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright, $29 is not a bad price, really, for that many games.

1358
01:26:43,454 --> 01:26:46,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, they're not all like shitty clones of each other, right?

1359
01:26:46,436 --> 01:26:48,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they're all like uniquely different, pretty cool games?

1360
01:26:49,018 --> 01:26:50,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're all uniquely different, and... That's cool.

1361
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:55,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already played a couple games of Wi-Fi, there is nothing like a good Wi-Fi game of BS.

1362
01:26:55,903 --> 01:26:56,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1363
01:26:57,183 --> 01:26:59,504
[SPEAKER_03]: and definitely nothing like a good Wi-Fi game of Speed.

1364
01:27:00,224 --> 01:27:03,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally going to be playing some of our chatters in Speed.

1365
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:04,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll buy this game just for that.

1366
01:27:05,126 --> 01:27:06,727
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have just released Speed and I'd buy that.

1367
01:27:06,747 --> 01:27:07,287
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great game.

1368
01:27:08,468 --> 01:27:14,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well I'll be picking up the game and we'll post on the forums and get an OLR get-together on the Clubhouse Games at some point.

1369
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:15,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, cool.

1370
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:17,291
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, thanks so much for calling in.

1371
01:27:17,311 --> 01:27:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1372
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:19,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a wonderful week.

1373
01:27:19,532 --> 01:27:19,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1374
01:27:19,692 --> 01:27:22,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skyflying tonight.

1375
01:27:22,553 --> 01:27:23,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for calling in.

1376
01:27:23,693 --> 01:27:24,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to those folks who didn't get through.

1377
01:27:25,765 --> 01:27:26,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Try again next time.

1378
01:27:26,927 --> 01:27:28,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Any last minute stories you want to share, Loki?

1379
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:28,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course I do.

1380
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:29,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, you always do.

1381
01:27:30,654 --> 01:27:32,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, some wonderful stuff.

1382
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:42,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, one thing about the Wii, since we were just talking about it, the Miis that you create, actually, they're going to be popping up in different things.

1383
01:27:42,105 --> 01:27:48,827
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, in games, you might see the other Miis that you've created in the audience, or in the stands for certain games.

1384
01:27:49,428 --> 01:27:55,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, they will be possibly migrating to other Wii systems, kind of like Animal Crossing, so that's kind of neat.

1385
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's kind of neat, yeah.

1386
01:27:58,091 --> 01:28:02,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not just your face in Wii Sports as the tennis wielder, you might just, you might start

1387
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:06,559
[SPEAKER_06]: infecting other consoles.

1388
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:07,259
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

1389
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:15,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other cool stuff, Rainbow Six Vegas is going to be seeing a demo on Xbox Live on October 23rd.

1390
01:28:15,622 --> 01:28:18,263
[SPEAKER_07]: That game looked pretty amazing, so worth checking out.

1391
01:28:19,563 --> 01:28:25,185
[SPEAKER_07]: As we mentioned before with GT, that it was going to have a steering wheel attachment for the Wii.

1392
01:28:25,665 --> 01:28:32,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Monster 4x4 World Circuit, another Ubisoft racing game, will also have that same steering wheel attachment as well for the Wii.

1393
01:28:33,311 --> 01:28:33,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Earthworm Jim

1394
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:05,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was a survey that went out for Guitar Hero that mentioned two games that are possibly in the works.

1395
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Keyboard Hero and Drummer Hero.

1396
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:12,782
[SPEAKER_07]: In no way, I'm sure, ripping off any Konami franchises with those.

1397
01:29:13,822 --> 01:29:15,442
[SPEAKER_07]: But interesting nonetheless.

1398
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I heard about that survey that went out.

1399
01:29:19,723 --> 01:29:20,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know though.

1400
01:29:21,383 --> 01:29:24,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people might be reading too much into that whole thing.

1401
01:29:24,604 --> 01:29:24,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1402
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:37,797
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also a really cool product that was released called Connect360 that indexes your iTunes and iPhoto libraries to stream them to the 360, which is interesting.

1403
01:29:37,857 --> 01:29:46,162
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to check that out, it's www.nullriver.com slash index slash products slash connect360.

1404
01:29:46,702 --> 01:29:47,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So go check that out.

1405
01:29:48,618 --> 01:29:52,399
[SPEAKER_07]: and then some more adult content that is available out there.

1406
01:29:53,419 --> 01:29:59,081
[SPEAKER_07]: For Dead or Alive Extreme 2, you will be getting changing sequences.

1407
01:29:59,901 --> 01:30:01,202
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, the girls will change.

1408
01:30:01,222 --> 01:30:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in Final Fantasy X-2?

1409
01:30:02,542 --> 01:30:04,442
[SPEAKER_06]: The girls will change.

1410
01:30:04,963 --> 01:30:05,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, yes.

1411
01:30:06,423 --> 01:30:07,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it.

1412
01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:15,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not like... It says it will be anime-inspired, resembling a transformation sequence you'd find in something like Sailor Moon.

1413
01:30:16,506 --> 01:30:16,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Curious.

1414
01:30:17,267 --> 01:30:17,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Horrors of Warcraft 7.95

1415
01:30:41,617 --> 01:30:43,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's real people.

1416
01:30:43,217 --> 01:30:44,958
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't Machima or anything like that.

1417
01:30:45,018 --> 01:30:51,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But they actually also have a MySpace community if you want to join that, which is MySpace.com slash Hordes of Warcraft.

1418
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:55,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I should also mention Orange Lounge Radio has a MySpace community that's more worth your time.

1419
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,541
[SPEAKER_06]: MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1420
01:30:57,561 --> 01:31:00,241
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have some chick that looks like she has elf ears.

1421
01:31:00,601 --> 01:31:01,701
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of interesting.

1422
01:31:02,222 --> 01:31:03,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your elf porn going on there.

1423
01:31:04,822 --> 01:31:05,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1424
01:31:05,402 --> 01:31:05,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1425
01:31:06,082 --> 01:31:06,302
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1426
01:31:06,543 --> 01:31:08,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I have received a hot tip.

1427
01:31:08,891 --> 01:31:18,094
[SPEAKER_06]: from a trusted source that WarioWare for the Wii is going to be bumped up to a launch title and you will be seeing that very soon.

1428
01:31:18,394 --> 01:31:22,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good, because I have that pre-ordered and it was only slated for January.

1429
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:26,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it looks like you may actually get your WarioWare on in November.

1430
01:31:26,597 --> 01:31:27,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1431
01:31:27,058 --> 01:31:29,579
[SPEAKER_06]: So take that as you will.

1432
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:33,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see Wii Play come out as a launch title too.

1433
01:31:34,048 --> 01:31:41,370
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura will be back next week to keep us in line and to read the emails and give you her website of the week, of which there is none this week because she's not here.

1434
01:32:01,127 --> 01:32:08,930
[SPEAKER_06]: and next week as well we'll have more you guys in our chat room and on the Skype line and more news and hopefully some interviews.

1435
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:15,834
[SPEAKER_06]: We are trying to get some interviews lined up for the rest of the month on through the year and thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio.

1436
01:32:15,954 --> 01:32:16,514
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1437
01:32:16,774 --> 01:32:18,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1438
01:32:18,615 --> 01:32:19,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Loki, your final thought?

1439
01:32:20,396 --> 01:32:23,717
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I have two episodes of my new show done already.

1440
01:32:24,617 --> 01:32:25,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Both an hour long.

1441
01:32:25,438 --> 01:32:25,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1442
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:29,880
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll be, yes, Orange Launch Radio will be participating in November sweeps this year.

1443
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:30,540
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I can say.

1444
01:32:31,983 --> 01:32:37,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought will be, well, on behalf of Jamie not being here, I will say reject false icons.

1445
01:32:38,128 --> 01:32:43,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And my other final thought would be how in the hell did six bottles of Aquafina end up over on Extra First's desk?

1446
01:32:43,852 --> 01:32:44,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of scary.

1447
01:32:45,093 --> 01:32:46,014
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all like half empty.

1448
01:32:46,614 --> 01:32:48,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, quite a bit of them are mostly full.

1449
01:32:48,836 --> 01:32:49,296
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

1450
01:32:49,456 --> 01:32:50,837
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is wrong with this picture?

1451
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:51,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a waster.

1452
01:32:51,938 --> 01:32:52,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Waster of water.

1453
01:32:52,819 --> 01:32:56,482
[SPEAKER_06]: All those countries out there that are like, you know, dehydrated.

1454
01:32:56,842 --> 01:32:57,122
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1455
01:32:57,588 --> 01:32:59,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us.

1456
01:32:59,328 --> 01:32:59,969
