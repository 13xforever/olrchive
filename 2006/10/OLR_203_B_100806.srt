1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,760
If this is your first time tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, remember, or hear for the first

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,980
time that our show is released in two parts every week.

3
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,520
We tape live on Sunday nights and then split it up and release it to our podcast feed twice

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
a week.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,560
So if you want to hear all the news we talked about in Part A, you've got to go download

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,240
Part A. But now it's time for Part B, isn't it, Loki?

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,040
Yes, it is.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,720
And as we mentioned in Part A, Final Fantasy XII has been pirated to the internet.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,160
Not too surprising, games have been pirated before, but it's 30 days before the game has

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,760
set the release in the United States.

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,000
And that's pretty interesting, that it's pirated.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,980
So anyways, the ISO's leaked to torrent sites and various news group sites, none of which

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:21,440
I'm a member of, and it's apparently legitimate from the people that have it, not me.

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,000
It's interesting, so if you should spend your money on the actual game, don't steal because

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
pirating's bad.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,840
I'll review it next week.

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,960
Now wait, what I'm curious about is, you know, sometimes when albums get leaked early, like,

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,400
I don't know, like didn't the Eminem, his last album, get released early?

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,560
And so they had to actually bump up the street date of the CD.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
Do you think that might happen with this game?

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
No.

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,940
I mean, if the game's already done and in the can, what are we waiting for?

23
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,940
Let's play it!

24
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,660
It's a review copy.

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,520
That's what got leaked, is a review copy.

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Ouch.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Anyone else that's been leaked to the internet?

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
What's that?

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
In the Groove 2 beta.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Really?

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Yeah.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Hm.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,240
It's funny how you find all these things out on torrent sites and other places.

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,200
Guys need to, the gaming companies need to keep a lock down on that stuff.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,560
They do, and you know what, there's no one to blame, no one to blame but themselves,

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,380
because these are their copies, they get leaked out, so.

37
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,480
What could they do to stop this?

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,760
Put serial numbers on them somehow, or what?

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,840
They could make them so they're only able to play on dev kits, and hope that the reviewers

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
have dev kits.

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,080
Because I mean, honestly, are you really going to have to fish for good reviews for Final

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Fantasy XII?

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,640
I mean, come on.

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,720
So you could do that, watermark them, so you know, each individual copy, although I know

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,800
it's going to be pretty difficult, each individual copy is watermarked so that you can check

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,480
a certain, you know, byte signature or whatever and see, oh, Bill over at such and such gaming

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,240
site leaked that out, I'm going to kill him!

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,200
I'm going to sue him for $11 billion dollars.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:04,320
Exactly, so my take on this, you know, I don't know, I think, great, you get to play it three

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
days early.

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Well, I think they should just release the damn game now, or don't put out your copy

52
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
so far in advance.

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,160
I guess maybe with so much to play through in Final Fantasy XII, that's why they did

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
it, but.

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
I guess.

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
I don't know.

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,120
And now you know all those marketing dollars that are getting pushed for Halloween, I don't

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
know.

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,640
But just again, you know, it's publicity for them.

60
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,600
The game will sell anyway.

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
You know, either way.

62
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,800
All right, well, we have another story here, and this is running on a site called qj.net,

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,920
and they ran a story this week that says, the ESRB don't play games!

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,060
And it goes like this, Aaron Ruby, the underground gaming culture spokesperson has a score to

65
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
settle with the ESRB.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,140
The ESRB has been independently applying and enforcing ratings and guidelines and online

67
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,180
privacy since 1994.

68
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,220
The writer stated in his opinion column that the system applied to rating games should

69
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,480
be different from those currently applied to TV and movies, which I disagree with.

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,960
I think if you want parents to know what the ratings are clear as day, make them the same

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
as movies.

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,760
Anyway, well, oh well.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,920
So anyway, how do they give out ratings anyway?

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,080
Well, they read and watch.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,000
What happens is the game developers fill out a questionnaire on what the game's about,

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
and the game developers submit it with footage of the most extreme scenes from the game.

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,620
There are three trained raiders, not expert game players, if you check out the website

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,040
you'll see this is true, from the board, and then they hand out the rating based on what

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,400
they read on the form and see on the videos.

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,280
So according to the writer, quote, I find it alarming that the ESRB does not bother

81
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
to base its ratings on the entire experience of playing a game, instead relying far too

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,760
much on submitted clips.

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,360
Which is interesting because that doesn't surprise me because I remember, and I'm not

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,120
going to say who this was, but I was at a conference, or I should say media show once,

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:54,600
and I overheard a developer saying about a game that featured a lot of cleavage in it,

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,600
and a lot of female stuff in it, yeah, we barely got this one by the ESRB, we showed

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,360
them this and this and this clip, and I was like, that seems a little bit, and now it

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,080
kind of adds up because I never really bothered to read up on how ESRB was reviewing games,

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,440
shame on me, but now this kind of adds up for me as I'm kind of like, oh, they were

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,760
just sending clips of maybe the little bit less scandalous stuff.

91
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,000
But there's huge fines for lying and stuff, as the makers of Grand Theft Auto are finding

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
out, although I still to this day say they weren't lying, they were just careless and

93
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,440
thinking they took out a portion of the game that they didn't.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,680
And it's gotten so ridiculous now where they're, you know, rating content that doesn't exist

95
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,240
in the game, you know, like Oblivion, you know, where they're rating it M because, yeah,

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,440
underneath the virtual clothes there's virtual nipples, so, I don't know, I think it's kind

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,600
of, interesting, but, alright.

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,280
But some other interesting stuff, speaking of virtual nipples, Playboy, you know, they've

99
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,080
been doing this thing for the last couple years now, releasing the Women of Video Games

100
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:06,640
spread in their magazine, yes, virtual naked women to ogle over, and both Fleshbot and

101
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,000
Kotaku have actually been running a preview picture of it, and we've got a list of the

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,760
people that are going to be featured in there, as well as, well, let's see, such wonderful

103
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:25,840
people, Sarah Morrison from Tabula Rasa, two of the women from the Scarface game, and we've

104
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:34,760
got two women from God of War 2, and Alicia Claus from Bullet Witch, Dr. Yasmin Lin from

105
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:43,560
Time Shift, and Erika from Splinter Cell Double Agent, a bunch of babes I've never heard of,

106
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,760
yeah, a bunch of games that aren't out yet, too, I see, so, very interesting, and that's

107
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,000
supposed to be coming out, I guess, later this year.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did you look at the spread?

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, I did.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Nice boobies?

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,100
Virtual boobies, the one chick I thought, you know, when I first looked at it, I'm like,

112
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,160
why are they putting Blood Ring in it again, because I don't play a lot of PC games, so,

113
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,840
I don't know, it, I guess if you're into that stuff, I don't know, I'd put this up as a

114
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
pokeball.

115
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
If you're into boobs?

116
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Well, if you're into this, like, you know, virtual, aren't they all fake boobs in Playboy?

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,720
I mean, seriously, they're all airbrushed and everything, I mean, what's the difference?

118
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Virtual boobs or airbrushed boobs?

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,600
You know what, these are probably more real than some of the pictures that are in there,

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,500
so, I don't know, I guess that's cool, I don't know, very early pictures still, though, it's

121
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,200
going to be a, they're going to have a two-page fold-out in the final version, and six pages

122
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,000
of gaming content.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
How many pages of boobies?

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Lots of boobies.

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
All right.

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,340
I don't know, Playboy is a lot of, a lot of ads, and there's, like, not that many boobies

127
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
in that magazine anymore.

128
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,420
Will you be picking up this copy of Playboy for the articles, or for the research material?

129
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,600
I did last year, I think.

130
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,140
Your wife probably took it from you.

131
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,980
I think she did.

132
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,840
For those of you that haven't met Logie's wife, she's hilarious, that's all I can say.

133
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
She's had cameos on Instagram.

134
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,320
There was something else I was going to mention, because this was also on Fleshbot linked to

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
the same story.

136
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Oh, dear.

137
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:21,120
There is a NerdCorps 2007 calendar out starring Sherry Roberts, and there's one picture-

138
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,280
Oh my God, my sister!

139
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,000
That joke, sorry.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,960
Anyways, there's one picture, though, that I thought was funny, and I showed Rob this

141
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,920
earlier, how they have her standing there naked with a power glove on, touching her

142
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,240
ass, and I thought that was funny.

143
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,000
So yeah, very interesting.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,280
I don't know, there's not much more I can really say about that.

145
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,920
If you want to purchase the calendar, though, you can get it at totallynerdcorps.com, and

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,960
I believe it's like 20 bucks.

147
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,320
I don't know, I guess it's worth your dollars.

148
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,480
I'm sorry, but I don't know, that's kind of hot.

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,360
If maybe chicks wearing gaming accessories aren't your thing, do you think that's hot?

150
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
I guess it could be, yeah.

151
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
All right.

152
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
You think your wife will think it's hot?

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,480
She probably should think it's stupid, but anyways, it says it's a limited edition.

154
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,120
They're going to have 2,500 copies, they're $25 each, features 12 months of girls with

155
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,640
a complete daily calendar grid and all that stuff.

156
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:35,840
They're pretty big, and yeah, lots of interesting pictures there.

157
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,200
I like the cover, though, the power glove.

158
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,400
What's up with this recent increase in erotic photography with gaming equipment?

159
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,420
Because I've seen this on the internet, and I was on some gay site, I don't remember which

160
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,280
one it was, but it was a gay gamer site, not gay porn.

161
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,640
I wouldn't do that, I'm a nice guy.

162
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,260
There was a gay gamer site that had pictures of guys covered in cartridges and nothing

163
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
but cartridges.

164
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,880
It kind of reminds me of this whole thing.

165
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,040
The Nerdcore calendar also has, other than your typical holidays, it has nerd holidays

166
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
in there.

167
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,080
Such, for example, the International San Diego Comic Con, Anime Expo, Game Developers Conference,

168
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,520
Talk Like a Pirate Day, Tokyo Game Show, The Transformers the Movie, Opening Day, and other

169
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,320
flagship nerd videos.

170
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:33,360
TotallyNerdcore.com is where you can purchase this calendar.

171
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,320
I got to say, damn it, we need to get them on the show and get one of these models on

172
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
the show.

173
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Wouldn't that be awesome?

174
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Wait until we all have any model on this show.

175
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,080
I don't know what else to say, so let's move on from boobies to violence.

176
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,440
All the great games have either boobies or violence in them.

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,680
Violence, violence, violence, this story is coming from GamePolitics.com, our friends

178
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
over there.

179
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,560
That has to do with the question and answer session with the Dean of the School of Social

180
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,320
Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.

181
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,840
His name is Richard J. Gelles.

182
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
And there was this interesting quote.

183
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,900
The question was, excuse me, sir, but what is your opinion on video games and the lack

184
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,640
of parenting to control the ever-increasing teen violence?

185
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,560
Answer, video games play almost no important role in teen violence.

186
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,600
Teens with a predisposition to being violent may be drawn to violent video games, but overall

187
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,520
other factors besides television, music, or video games are more important risk factors

188
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
for teen violence.

189
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,440
Again, that quote from Richard Gelles, the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice

190
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,600
at the University of Pennsylvania, also the Director of Center for Research on Youth and

191
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,680
Social Policy.

192
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,280
So this guy does know what he's talking about, I guess.

193
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,600
It makes him pretty smart now, doesn't it?

194
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,480
Speaking of doctors and stuff, we've got one doctor who is actually defected to the PSP

195
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,840
and that would be Dr. Kawawashima.

196
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,960
You might know him from Brain Age.

197
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,600
Well anyways, he's coming to a brand new game being put out called Mind Quiz coming out

198
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,360
in November and it's actually going to be pretty much the same kind of stuff.

199
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,400
They've got your Brain Age score and stuff like that.

200
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,680
So imagine Brain Age minus a touch screen and on your PSP.

201
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,920
That's kind of big news because this guy, he was doing the DS stuff and those games

202
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,720
are huge in Japan and now he's kind of defected in a way to the PSP.

203
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,920
I don't think Nintendo is going to slow down their big brain series any time soon, but

204
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
kind of interesting.

205
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,440
I wonder what possessed him to do that.

206
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,920
Well, I mean, money?

207
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Maybe.

208
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,800
There's more brain training games coming out.

209
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,840
I know, I think Majesco has two coming out in November.

210
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Like Brain Wave, I think it was called.

211
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,200
Now it's just going to be like all those crappy Nintendogs knockoffs we got a while

212
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
back.

213
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,520
Oh God, November is the month for Nintendogs knockoffs.

214
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,440
They've got the whole dogs, cats, hamster life, horses.

215
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,080
Uh oh, I shudder to think what might be possible in a hamster life.

216
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,880
Anyway, let's move on and get some feedback from you guys, the listeners.

217
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,440
Every week we invite your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and DarkSakura is

218
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,080
typically here to read through the email, but as you know, she's not here tonight, so

219
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:36,840
I'm going to instead borrow her asbestos suit and put on the gloves and dig into our Mailbag.

220
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,920
First thing I want to say is we got a lot of emails this week, a lot of emails, and

221
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,200
we love reading your emails, but unfortunately we just don't have the time to read them all

222
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
on air.

223
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,080
I'm going to read five of them tonight, which is a lot, but please keep them coming in and

224
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,040
we try to respond to as many as we can get and we love reading your guys' opinions, so

225
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,560
please don't stop just because we don't read your emails.

226
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Sorry.

227
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,640
Alright, so this first email comes to us from Deepman.

228
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,200
Deepman writes, Hey guys, just thinking about the new next gen consoles and had these thoughts.

229
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
1.

230
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,120
The cost of the Wii at $249.

231
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,640
I think they chose to set it at this price not to make money, even though it is selling

232
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,000
it more than it's worth, but for the simple reason that Nintendo doesn't want you to get

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
any other console.

234
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,440
Just think for a second, with a $150-$200 console, an Xbox 360 sounds mighty enticing

235
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,400
to go with it, but a $250 console plus games, suddenly that extra 360 doesn't look as good.

236
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,100
To back this up, I remember hearing a quote posted on Kotaku by Reggie that said something

237
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,960
along the lines of, and I'm paraphrasing here, quote, I've heard of the Wii 60, but our users

238
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,720
buy our consoles because they want a different experience.

239
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,640
If they want something else, they can get a DS.

240
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,080
Again, I'm paraphrasing, but it sounds like Nintendo is being smart with the pricing,

241
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
if only to cut out the competition.

242
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,960
What do you think of that?

243
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
I don't know.

244
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,760
That sounds pretty accurate.

245
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,120
It's an interesting theory, but I don't think that was a factor in the price point they

246
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,840
chose was because it makes the 360 sound less appealing.

247
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I don't know.

248
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,000
I think if they could make it cheaper, I think in the long run it's which system costs which.

249
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,040
I think your average family is only going to get one console unless they have some hardcore

250
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,960
gamers in the house, if even that.

251
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,840
It's a good theory, and it may be right, but I just kind of think there's a lot of other

252
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,880
factors that come into play.

253
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,760
Dick Mann also writes this, too.

254
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,720
Region-free PlayStation 3, not as elaborate as the last theory, but what if the reason

255
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,640
Sony is making the console region-free is quite simply to combat mod chippers?

256
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,140
A strong case, and the one most used in courts, especially in Australia so far, is that people

257
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,600
mod their systems to play import games.

258
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,440
What if this is simply a way to nip the next-gen mod chippers in the bud before they start?

259
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
What do you think of that, Loki?

260
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Could be.

261
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,880
I think, mainly, you know the whole HDMI being added to all the different systems and stuff?

262
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,440
I think that kind of ties in with it, because now they can do the digital flag on all the

263
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,520
movies, and they might be able to do that with all the games now, too, if they have

264
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
HDMI on there.

265
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,000
But I guess since they do give the option not to use the HDMI, that might not be the

266
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,480
case, but yeah, region-free, I mean, I don't see why they don't, I mean, when you think

267
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
about it, because a lot of games, I mean, if you're going to import them, that's more

268
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,760
sales for them anyways, so I don't see what the big difference is, I mean, granted you

269
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,960
get stuff early, but it's not going to be, you know, it's only, it's not going to be

270
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,560
translated for over here, unless it already comes in both languages anyways, which, why

271
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,680
wouldn't you release them in both territories?

272
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,640
Alright, there's still more email here from Deep Man, that's all I've got for now, but

273
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,200
I want to let you guys know that my girlfriend and I went to see Play, the video game symphony,

274
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,520
last weekend in Toronto, and it was amazing.

275
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,200
We met Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, the guy who did the music for Shenmue and the Daytona theme,

276
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,880
which he performed a new piano version live, and the guys who did the music for Prey and

277
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Oblivion.

278
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,200
All I have to say is that if this comes to a town near you, guys, make sure to check

279
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,280
them out, perhaps the most amazing show I've ever seen.

280
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,560
And Sky, you should definitely move up to Canada, I did seven months ago and haven't

281
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,020
been happier, keep up the good work, still listening, Deep Man.

282
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Thank you very much.

283
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:08,480
As far as Canada goes, you know, it's a nice thought, I'd love to maybe retire up there,

284
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,360
but just for right now, there's too much going on for me here in the States.

285
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,400
But I definitely will be taking another vacation up there, probably next year, we'll see.

286
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,480
Our next email comes to us from Malice, the artist formerly known as Stupid Baka, or so

287
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,240
his signature says, Hello Orange Lounge, I'd just like to say before I say anything else

288
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
that I really love your show.

289
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,040
I used to be a live listener since the days of B3, that was the big DDR tournament we

290
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,320
did in San Francisco we covered.

291
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,280
I remember seeing you folks down at B3, which was definitely awesome.

292
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,480
I also remember meeting Sky before a Milpitas Golf Land DDR tournament also.

293
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
Those are all very good times, by the way.

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,240
Unfortunately I can no longer catch the live show, but I do make sure to download the podcast

295
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
off iTunes.

296
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,160
You folks still are awesome and I really like the show.

297
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,240
I love sitting in my room and doing my homework or talking to friends with the podcast in

298
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
the background.

299
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,420
I also like your guys' quirky attitudes and witty remarks from time to time, especially

300
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,600
those that belong to Dark Sakura and Sky.

301
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
You guys make my day.

302
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,400
In other words, Loki, sorry, you suck.

303
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Just kidding.

304
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,160
No, thank you seriously for the words, I appreciate it.

305
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,640
I know this is a recurring theme of discussion on the podcast and I was just wondering what

306
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
you guys thought of this.

307
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,600
I am a member of my school's mock trial team and have been since last year.

308
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,860
This year's case is People vs. Campbell, in which a student that is being bullied allegedly

309
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,120
created a time bomb to blow up his school.

310
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,220
He is being charged with acts of terrorism, intent to murder, placing an offensive substance

311
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,480
in a public place, and possessing a violent video game.

312
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,920
All the mock trial cases have pre-trial arguments in which we argue to a judge about certain

313
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,140
aspects of the case before it occurs, specifically in regards to evidence, the Constitution's

314
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,140
Bill of Rights, and whether it shall be allowed during the case.

315
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,760
The defense in this pre-trial argument will argue that video games are protected speech

316
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,400
under the First Amendment, which is something I agree with, as do you guys, I assume.

317
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,080
This seems to be echoed, as all the cases that they have given us that are relevant

318
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,880
and have precedent are all in favor of the defense.

319
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,560
This is definitely a change, as most of the cases each year, especially in pre-trial,

320
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,540
are made so that they aren't one-sided and can be argued both ways, ensuring for an exciting

321
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,560
trial based on how good each side is, which is why I'll most likely be on the prosecution

322
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
this year.

323
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,480
I was just wondering what you guys have to say about this, as I know that you three are

324
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,000
very vocal and have a lot to say about this issue.

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,280
Have a nice three-day weekend.

326
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,160
Unfortunately, it's not three days for me.

327
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I have to work tomorrow, even if it is Columbus Day.

328
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Nor me.

329
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,640
Yeah, well, lucky you guys that get it off.

330
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,780
Anyway, I don't know much about the specific case that you're citing.

331
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,400
Just based off of other cases, I think you pretty much said what I feel.

332
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,320
I would agree with the fact that video games are a form of art, just like – and I'm

333
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,080
not talking about art as in a classic sculpture you might see, but it is a form of expression.

334
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,400
Expression is art, and it's no different than a movie or a CD.

335
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,960
I think, therefore, it should be viewed at very similarly by the public.

336
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,640
There are the people that criticize violent movies, and they probably do criticize violent

337
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
games.

338
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,340
But you can't say that a kid played a video game and that's what caused him to go crazy,

339
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,560
because what about the R-rated movies he might have seen?

340
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,940
Or what about the dirty music he might have been listening to?

341
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,320
But more importantly, what about the parents?

342
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
What about the home life?

343
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Where was the love?

344
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Where was the hug?

345
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,800
Where was the how was your day?

346
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,640
What's more important than the CDs, movies, or video games combined, in my opinion?

347
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,920
Loki anything you want to add to that?

348
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,560
No, it's basically just bad parenting.

349
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,600
And I'm looking at chat room to see what things they're talking about there.

350
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,360
Black Boy says, dirty music?

351
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,320
Like Christina Aguilera's last album, Going to Get Dirty.

352
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
Next email comes to us from Mr. Wonderful.

353
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,560
Hey guys and lady.

354
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,840
First off, thanks for putting on the show.

355
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,760
I emailed Skye earlier, but figured that I should be thanking you all.

356
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,360
I recently graduated college and got a great job right after graduation.

357
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,120
It's really awesome, but it doesn't leave me a lot of time to sit around with my friends

358
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
and just geek out.

359
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,880
I've got an hour commute though, and your show really hits the spot.

360
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,960
I still have to put on my suit and tie every day, but it's great to listen to you guys

361
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,080
on the way to work.

362
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,560
It's like hanging out with some very well-informed friends and talking about games.

363
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
So thanks again.

364
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
You guys rock.

365
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,120
And Dark Sakura, don't let any haters get you down.

366
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,520
Even a relative noob to the show like myself can tell you know what you're talking about.

367
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,440
For Christ's sake, you mentioned the turbo duo and radiant silver gun in the same breath.

368
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,880
If treasure shooters aren't hardcore anymore, then nothing is.

369
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,320
I've got to agree though that you really should play Pinball Quest.

370
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,680
Even though she's not here tonight, I'll make sure she sees that part of the email.

371
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,280
I'm sure she will appreciate that, and I will make her play Pinball Quest.

372
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Anyway, forgive me if these questions have been asked, but I'm still making my way through

373
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
the backlog.

374
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,600
On to a few quick questions.

375
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,760
First off, have you guys had the power to resurrect one franchise for a well-done Wii

376
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,200
make, bringing back an old game, giving it a sequel with quality Wii functionality?

377
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,600
What would you go for?

378
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,440
Maybe it's just the recent re-release on GBA Talking, but I've got to think a Wii Bionic

379
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,480
Commando would do the job pretty nicely.

380
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Thoughts?

381
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,440
If it's 3D, maybe.

382
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,800
What game would you like to see Wii made?

383
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,080
Well, I know Kid Icarus is the obvious answer that most fanboys I'm sure would be foaming

384
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,120
at the mouth for, and that would definitely be my number one answer.

385
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,080
But as far as a GameCube game that I'd like to see on the Wii, I want to see F-Zero have

386
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
another shot.

387
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,040
And I'm sure there will be some type of F-Zero on the Wii, but I really enjoyed the GameCube

388
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,360
one, and I think it was a little bit underrated in part because the arcade version had one

389
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,400
key flaw, and that was the fact that there was really only the one model, which was very

390
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,200
expensive because the car moved around a lot, and the fact there was only six tracks in

391
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,900
the arcade, and you can unlock them all in the home version.

392
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,560
I think there was a lot to still be discovered with that concept that I think unfortunately

393
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,880
in the execution kind of fell apart.

394
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,920
But you know, the whole driving with the Wii stick might be kind of interesting in F-Zero

395
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
or something.

396
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,640
At least even with the slightly souped-up graphics and sound, I would like to see that

397
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,040
and the sound coming out of the controller, I'm really looking forward to a new F-Zero

398
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
game.

399
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
And online, please.

400
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Anything?

401
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Loki, you can think of?

402
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,960
It's kind of hard.

403
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,280
I don't really know.

404
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
What could we do?

405
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,600
That would be really awesome.

406
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,320
Let's see.

407
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,560
Drunami says Capcom seriously needs to put Okami on the Wii.

408
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,840
Yeah, that's not a Wii make-up.

409
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,480
DMN says Kirby's Dream Force.

410
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
That might be kind of fun, he could actually swing the ball.

411
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,520
That was a fun game on Super Nintendo.

412
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't know, I'd say just remake, like make a good, even like a Castlevania would

413
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,440
be kind of cool, a good Castlevania for 3D and make it like a first person shooter would

414
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
be kind of neat.

415
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Really?

416
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I want to see him do the 2D.

417
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
I got excited by the 2D news last week.

418
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:59,280
Well, 2D, you can have a 2D Castlevania too, I mean, just maybe Blaster Master maybe?

419
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Now that's hot.

420
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,240
Alright, let's go to the next email.

421
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,920
Hey guys, it's Neodude, belated congrats on 200 and all that.

422
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,320
I just wanted to talk about the Sonic demo on 360 for a moment and why it sucked.

423
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,600
Oh my god, I played that actually now.

424
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
What'd you think?

425
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
It sucked.

426
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,440
It was just like horrible controls.

427
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,720
I couldn't even make it over the first jump because it was just veering off to the side

428
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,320
when I had hit tap the button to the side.

429
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,120
The email continues for Neodude here.

430
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,080
The big thing was the camera sucked.

431
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,480
Sonic has always relied on good camera control and it's not here.

432
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,120
Plus the demo gave Sonic everything he had at the end of Sonic Adventure 2, including

433
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,400
the bounce bracelet, which leads to many unexpected deaths, especially when you're trying to light

434
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,640
dash in the air.

435
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,640
If they include a window that tells you what the X button does at any time and fix the

436
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,440
camera and maybe take out the bounce bracelet, everything else should be alright.

437
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Catch you next episode.

438
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,800
Well, I hope they changed something.

439
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,400
I know they've been getting negative feedback around the web and who knows, it may result

440
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,720
in a delay of the game, I don't know, but it would be nice to see them go back and change

441
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
things.

442
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
We'll see.

443
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,960
What they should do is have an option when you're running straight to be able to strafe

444
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
a little bit.

445
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
They need a strafe button in it.

446
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,200
So when I'm running straight ahead, when I try to be a little off on the rings there,

447
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm not going to all of a sudden veer off to the side.

448
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,840
That's what they need to fix.

449
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,800
This last email tonight comes to us from Lazer123454321.

450
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,960
And he writes this, Hi Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura.

451
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,480
I first wanted to thank you for giving the Bimani community its first podcast as well

452
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,040
as your general game coverage.

453
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Read.

454
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
You rock.

455
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,920
I like all the politeness, like the fluffing of the egos in the first paragraph of all

456
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
our letters tonight.

457
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,360
No, seriously, we love the fact that you guys are so receptive to it.

458
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
It's awesome.

459
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,160
Second, I would like to get your in-depth view of the new DDR Supernova for PlayStation

460
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
2.

461
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,480
Just to tell about some of the experiences I've had, the new Stellar Master Mode far

462
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,080
outshines the Dance Master Mode of DDR EX and EX2, as the majority of the unlocks can be

463
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,120
done just by completing the first few trials in each Stellar joint and then facing the

464
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
showdown.

465
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,680
I personally play Controller Controller Revolution.

466
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,960
We call it Button Button Revolution, but that's fine.

467
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,760
So I like to face the Diamond EX Showdown or EX Showdown in each joint.

468
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,000
Anything you want to say additional about DDR Supernova, Loki?

469
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,120
I haven't played it yet.

470
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,560
I did play it a little bit.

471
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
And I agree.

472
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,440
I gave my fuller review on last week's program, so you can go back and download that in Part

473
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,960
A. But I definitely think it's a solid entry into the series.

474
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,080
And we'll give you lots of new songs.

475
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,920
I like the song list, and I do agree that Stellar Master Mode is an improvement on the

476
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
mode they had last year.

477
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,200
But I didn't despise the mode they had last year so much.

478
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,360
I felt it's okay to have the really, really hard songs kind of tricky to unlock because

479
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
they're extra.

480
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
They're bonus.

481
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,000
They're supposed to take a lot of effort to unlock.

482
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,740
But I think they did do a little bit better this time.

483
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
Other questions.

484
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,680
One, what do you think about the song list as compared to the other US releases?

485
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,320
I think it's a pretty good song list.

486
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,160
I do too, but Max 2 was still my favorite overall, just as an old school DDR fan.

487
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,440
But I do think it was better than Extreme 1's song list.

488
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,400
Two, what are some downfalls with the game?

489
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,720
Link mode disappearing was an interesting thing that was a bit of a downfall of the

490
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,280
game, I think.

491
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,680
Other downfalls for the game.

492
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,320
Oh, the fact that they got rid of a lot of the videos.

493
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,420
I don't like the whole dancer in the custom-generated background or whatever.

494
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,400
One thing I liked about DDR was some of the art backgrounds they had, and I always kind

495
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,720
of looked forward to seeing some of the ones they came up with for new songs.

496
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
It's kind of not there in Supernova.

497
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,640
This is a stupid request, but the one I made before went on Extreme 2 is not being able

498
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,760
to put in edits for the IToy stuff.

499
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,080
You can't put in hand things on your edits.

500
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,400
That would have been cool if you could do that.

501
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,240
Granted, hardly anyone actually uses it, but how hard would it be to put that as an option

502
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
for your edits?

503
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I don't understand.

504
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,480
Three, what do you think about Konami bringing back Battle Mode?

505
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,520
I think it should be more prevalent in their next release.

506
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,880
I think they should really explore what they can do with versus mode, because I used to

507
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,480
say this way back when the show was strictly about Bomani Games and we had the three-hour

508
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
show.

509
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,800
I think the future of DDR was in a versus mode.

510
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,960
I would like to see more competitive style play and options, so I think it's a good step

511
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,000
in the right direction, but I'd like to see that option more fully researched in the next

512
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,800
release of DDR and do more with it.

513
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Just a thought.

514
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,440
Four, what is your opinion on the online controversy?

515
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,540
For those that don't know, the game features a few songs that are online only.

516
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:43,600
That is, you cannot play songs that are exclusive to online play in the free dance mode offline,

517
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,300
even after having played them in the online mode.

518
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,200
Some have speculated that when Konami shuts down Supernova online play like they did for

519
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,960
Extreme 2, that these songs will be lost.

520
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,480
Others believe that when this happens, Konami will reveal an unlocked code for the songs

521
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,740
for offline play.

522
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,160
I don't think it's the doom and gloom most people are shouting about.

523
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,880
It's something extra.

524
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,040
What if you have an Xbox that doesn't go online?

525
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,160
There's many great songs that you're missing out on.

526
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,960
Now, granted, I see the difference because you can download those songs and play them

527
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,800
offline whenever you want.

528
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,460
But I would speculate that if there's a Supernova 2 or whatever is next, which I would find

529
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,480
it hard to believe there's not going to be at least one more PlayStation 2 game next

530
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,940
year, I would bet almost anything you're going to see those five songs in the default song

531
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,920
list for next year's game.

532
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,900
So I don't know anything that's just speculation, but it would make sense.

533
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,740
And then people wouldn't complain about repeats so much because they didn't really have them

534
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
in the last game.

535
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,080
What if they're just going to be unlocked at a time unlock type of thing?

536
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,600
Like they're going to be unlocked on a certain date, say when the other games come out.

537
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I don't think they are.

538
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,360
I seriously think they're ever going to be unlocked.

539
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,880
I think online only is online only, and I think that's it.

540
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,680
That's until someone puts out a code for it.

541
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
That's true.

542
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Someone might hack a save.

543
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,400
And to be honest, the content is there, so...

544
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
True.

545
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
So who knows?

546
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Why not?

547
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,600
And then lastly, and finally for those involved in the StepMania community, Loki might want

548
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
to read this.

549
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,760
There's a Supernova-like theme out already.

550
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,400
It's called New Nova.

551
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,480
It looks really good, but most of the features of Supernova cannot be replicated in StepMania

552
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
at this time.

553
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:31,560
Takuya's DDR Extreme, Daikatsu 88, Katsu Extreme, and K Eternal DDR Red, read K Eternal, have

554
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,920
expressed interest in doing a Supernova theme, and Takuya will start work as soon as he has

555
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,600
rips from the Supernova disc.

556
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,920
I believe K Eternal is waiting for StepMania 4.0's theming engine to be finalized before

557
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,360
he starts work.

558
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,040
It's not that hard to rip stuff off that disc, and to be honest, it's funny how I mentioned

559
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,600
In the Groove 2 beta had already been leaked.

560
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,360
They've already made tools to basically reskin it, re-put songs in it for your own stuff,

561
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,280
like they did with In the Groove 1.

562
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:08,200
So, you know, it's going to be possible pretty soon just to do all that stuff pretty easy.

563
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,160
I mean, hell, they've already automated the whole ripping of In the Groove stuff off of

564
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,200
the disc once the game comes out.

565
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,440
I have to be honest, I'm just not that big on playing DDR on my computer.

566
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Well, that's the thing.

567
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,400
With the In the Groove rips that you can do in the editing, you can actually either, if

568
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,840
you have a modded PS2, you can dump it to a disc and actually play it on the Playstation

569
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,600
2, or if you have a hard drive like mine does, you can dump the ISO to the hard drive and

570
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,600
play it off of that, and you can actually play your DDR on the Playstation 2.

571
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,840
Alright, well that's going to do it for the mailbag this week, and lots of great emails

572
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
this week.

573
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Again, sorry to those we didn't get to tonight.

574
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,160
If you want to send us some email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

575
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,080
Let's go to the next story.

576
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,280
Loki, excellent.

577
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,920
Well, the big story this week is, well one of the big stories, Mark Raine is basically

578
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,800
saying that the second gen game Gears of War on the 360 looks better than the first gen

579
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,360
PS3 titles, and you know, he's sort of right on some of those, but I don't know, it's all

580
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
pinning.

581
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,920
Sony says their next generation starts when they say so, I say bullshit, and basically

582
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,400
stating that the next gen will start when that game comes out.

583
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,640
I don't know, whatever, big talk, but we'll see.

584
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,040
Sounds like people just kind of whipping it out back and forth, typical PR, trying to

585
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,600
slam the other guy type stuff.

586
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,320
Alright, well speaking of the Xbox 360, of course when Doom came out, a lot of people

587
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,300
were like, where's Duke Nukem?

588
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,040
If you're going to bring us Doom, you need to bring us Duke Nukem.

589
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:47,360
Well, there was an interesting post by a staff of 3D Realms, quote, you'd be surprised what

590
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,520
they've turned down.

591
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,840
Don't just assume MS will want it just because you like it and it's popular.

592
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,000
Hate to sound defeatist, but it's not as easy as send it to Microsoft and get it on there.

593
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,960
It's a rather complicated procedure and Microsoft is fairly picky about what goes on there.

594
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,240
Sorry to sound so defeatist, but individual users won't do much of anything.

595
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,120
Now if you could get something on the order of a million people to do the same thing,

596
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,360
that might be different, but talking to one person like that isn't going to do anything.

597
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,560
Besides, if you can think of it, they already have, I bet on it.

598
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,680
Plus, as I said above, we've already talked about it ourselves, I've talked about this

599
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,440
yesterday with George, he's all up for the idea, but we don't have the time to do the

600
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
port ourselves.

601
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,960
Plus, there's the issue of whether Microsoft would really want it.

602
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,200
Don't just assume they would, there's a big submissions procedure to go through.

603
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,960
Plus, their release schedule is booked solid for quite a while now, even if we delivered

604
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,080
it to them today, I would imagine it wouldn't come out for a while anyway.

605
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,120
Oh come on, they can release two games in one day?

606
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,380
I have a hard time their schedule is so booked solid when things keep getting pushed back

607
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,760
and we have to get things like the Project Gotham deck for Uno to hold us over.

608
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,000
I mean, if they're so booked, why don't they release two games in one day?

609
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,120
Is it going to kill the server that much?

610
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
I mean, come on.

611
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,360
Well, I think they're afraid that one game would outshine another.

612
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,560
That's why they don't release like 10 or 15 at a time, because they want all the games

613
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
to have a fair shot.

614
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Does that make sense?

615
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
No, it doesn't make sense, that's stupid.

616
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,680
I mean, the game's going to be up there anyways, so, okay, say, Dig Dug and Duke Nukem get

617
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
released at the same time.

618
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,120
Grand Dig Dug's not going to sell as well, but you know what, people will buy it later

619
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
on.

620
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Who cares?

621
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,880
Or put it up like a free game, like Totem Ball and Duke Nukem 3D.

622
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,800
There you go, you have your free game that doesn't matter how many copies you sell on

623
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,360
that or put out on that, and then you have Duke Nukem 3D.

624
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,920
I don't know, I don't see what the big deal is.

625
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,720
I think what the big deal is, they don't want to work on it because they're not fucking

626
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,620
done with Duke Nukem Forever yet, and to be honest, just put the damn thing out.

627
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,480
It's never going to be perfect, you're never going to finish it, the generation of hardwares

628
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,480
is going to get better and better each time you're about done.

629
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,160
It's never going to happen.

630
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:57,440
Anyways, some other interesting stuff though, like Duke Nukem 3D, you know, had a pretty

631
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
good multiplayer.

632
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,740
Well, another game that has really good multiplayer, Lost Planet, and we will be seeing a multiplayer

633
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,560
demo this winter, which is pretty cool, so, yeah, looking forward to that, probably in

634
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,400
November sometime, would be my guess.

635
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,800
You know, I wasn't that big on Lost Planet when I played it.

636
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,080
I don't know, I'm not sure what all the hype's about.

637
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,800
Maybe it's just not my kind of game, but maybe a multiplayer would change my mind, if I had

638
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
a lot of fun with that.

639
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Yeah.

640
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Are you more excited about this game?

641
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Did you enjoy the first demo that came out?

642
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,600
I don't like the first demo, I'm not sure if I'd buy it though, right away, I mean,

643
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,200
I think about that time, I'm going to be busy with the Wii, so, you know, I'm not sure if

644
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,360
I really want to buy this game right away.

645
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,600
I mean, it was a cool game, I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks really good, just,

646
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,560
I don't know if it, I really don't need to be buying that many games now, so.

647
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
All right.

648
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,400
Well, let's do another story here, and this one is regarding Full Auto II, is going to

649
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,440
be releasing some PS3 online details.

650
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,280
Apparently, the developers behind Full Auto II actually released some of the details about

651
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,000
what online's going to be all about, and it was on this Radio PM podcast.

652
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,720
The Full Auto II producer, Mike Gallo from Sega of America, talked about what was going

653
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,200
on, and the OPM asked, so when you go into network play, you'll see sort of a browser,

654
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,400
and they say, when you first turn on the machine, it logs you in automatically.

655
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,520
I think you can change that in the settings, you have a user ID and an online profile that's

656
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,240
set up through the PlayStation, we don't have anything to do with that, that's all done

657
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,800
through the PlayStation network.

658
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,280
When you log in, and as long as you have an ID and you're an active online member, when

659
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,680
you go into the online modes, you get a menu option, you get to pick ranked or unranked

660
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,920
play, then you'll see what games are available and then jump into one of those, kind of interesting.

661
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,800
There's more information, as far as stat tracking, is it all within Full Auto, is that outside?

662
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,720
When you play ranked play, your stats, pretty basic set of stats, wins, losses, will get

663
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,320
uploaded to GameSpy.

664
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,600
You'll be able to see, I think we have it sortable by, it's worldwide and monthly or

665
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,260
all time, so you'll get to see who's ranked where.

666
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,060
You'll be able to access it from our website as well, so you can look at those stats independently

667
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,720
of the game.

668
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,120
Mr. Big on 360, did you guys think about throwing in that concept for PS3?

669
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,640
We actually do not have that in Full Auto 2.

670
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,600
It's a feature we had to regrettably not support.

671
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,760
A lot of it was just because of that moving target with the development timeline.

672
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,780
We had to make sure our online modes and network play was solid before we added some of that

673
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
other stuff.

674
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,760
Unfortunately, that was one of the things we had to drop.

675
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,500
Kind of interesting though, if that means that there's not really going to be achievements

676
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
like we know it on the 360.

677
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,280
It's just going to be on whatever games that they want to support it on.

678
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,840
That's kind of big news, I guess.

679
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,440
I don't know, I guess they could patch it later.

680
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,840
That might be kind of neat.

681
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,800
All right, well, we're going to go now to a new segment, which is a new game.

682
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,560
We're going to play a new game tonight, so Loki, you know I'm going to suck you into

683
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
playing this game.

684
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
You ready for it?

685
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
Sure.

686
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
All right.

687
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,120
No, you'll like this game.

688
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Okay.

689
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
All right.

690
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,600
We thought we'd bring on a contestant of our choosing tonight.

691
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Caller, are you there?

692
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Yes, I am.

693
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Hi.

694
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Who is this?

695
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
This is Bobby from Atlanta.

696
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,280
Hi, Bobby from Atlanta.

697
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,000
Hey, is this the same Bobby that does his own show on Sunday nights on another network?

698
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You know it is.

699
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Of course.

700
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
See now, there's a reason why I invited Bobby to be the first one to play this new game

701
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
here on the show.

702
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,280
It's because there's been a little bit of smack talking in the past between Loki and

703
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,120
Bobby and ChromeHounds, which never happened, and we're going to play each other these games,

704
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
and it never really happened.

705
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,400
No, it didn't.

706
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,880
So I decided we here at Orange Laundry would provide an opportunity for there to be a great

707
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,800
podcast war, if you will.

708
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Okay.

709
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
All right.

710
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
So are you ready, Bobby?

711
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Are you going to kick Loki's ass?

712
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Yes, I will.

713
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
All right.

714
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
He sounds quite confident.

715
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Two words.

716
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Shenanigans.

717
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Shenanigans.

718
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:02,840
All right, well, we're going to play a brand new game, and it's called the Video Game Showdown.

719
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:09,840
It's horrible music, dude.

720
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,920
I have no reason why we're using the pressure lock theme for this, but I just wanted an

721
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,080
excuse to use the pressure lock theme at some point during the program.

722
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,320
All right, the Video Game Showdown is a brand new game here on Orange Laundry Radio.

723
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,200
Here is how it's going to work.

724
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,920
Now first things first, no fair using Google or the internet to cheat at this game, because

725
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,880
some of you people can do your research mighty fast, so no fair.

726
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
You're on your honor.

727
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
Okay, Bobby, I want a fair fight.

728
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,240
Am I allowed to at least write things down?

729
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,480
Yes, you can write things down.

730
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
That's certainly acceptable.

731
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
You just can't research.

732
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
You have to be on your own here.

733
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
All right.

734
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
So this is how it's going to work.

735
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,480
I'm going to read you a list of ten items in a category, but only five of them actually

736
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,520
apply.

737
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,040
So you have to guess which five are the correct answers.

738
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,460
Here's tonight's category.

739
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Tonight's category is, per the website video game charts, five of these games are the top

740
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:13,180
five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.

741
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:20,680
So tonight's topic is the top five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.

742
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,680
You ready for the list?

743
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Sure.

744
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
All right.

745
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Here we go.

746
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Here's your ten options.

747
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:35,280
Animal Crossing Wild World, Brain Training, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart

748
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:49,080
DS, Metroid Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris

749
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,880
DS, and WarioWare.

750
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,880
Again, of those ten I just named, five of them are the best-selling worldwide DS games

751
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,880
to date.

752
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,680
Here it is again one more time real quick, and then we'll get the answers.

753
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,480
Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart DS, Metroid

754
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris DS, and WarioWare.

755
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,080
Loki, you about ready?

756
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,080
I am ready.

757
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
You're ready?

758
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Yeah.

759
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
All right.

760
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
What's the five you're going to pick, Loki?

761
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:31,680
The five I'm going to pick, Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario

762
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,880
Brothers, and Nintendogs.

763
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
All right.

764
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,800
Bobby, which five are you going to pick?

765
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:45,080
My five are Brain Training, Mario DS, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, and Super

766
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,680
Mario 64.

767
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
All right.

768
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
There they are.

769
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,800
Very similar list, only one difference between them, and that could be the make or break.

770
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Here's what happens.

771
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,560
If we have a tie, and Bobby and Loki have the same amount correct, then Bobby can either

772
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,660
change one of his own answers after I tell him how many he has right, or he can force

773
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,080
Loki to change one of his, so that way we prevent a tie.

774
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,400
Let's first check the correct answers and see if we have a tie tonight.

775
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,480
It looks like we do not have a tie tonight.

776
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,200
All right.

777
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,080
Bobby, we'll start with you.

778
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,440
You got four right.

779
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Four out of five right.

780
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Not bad.

781
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Brain Training is correct.

782
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,800
Mario Kart DS is correct.

783
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,240
New Super Mario Brothers is correct, and Nintendogs is correct.

784
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,080
Those are four, but Loki, that bastard got all five of them right.

785
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Hell yeah.

786
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
I can't believe it.

787
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,320
I was concentrating on Japan.

788
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Did you cheat?

789
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
No, I wasn't.

790
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,280
I concentrated on thinking about what was popular in Japan.

791
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
All right.

792
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
That's right.

793
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,680
The top five selling games of all time, Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New

794
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,320
Super Mario Brothers, and Nintendogs.

795
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,560
Because they also packed in New Super Mario Brothers... No, actually, no, they didn't.

796
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
No, it wasn't a pack-in.

797
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Yeah.

798
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
Well.

799
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
I was a good guess from Bobby.

800
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,560
Actually, it's a trick, though.

801
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,480
Mario 64 was actually number six, so it was really close.

802
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,560
My reasoning was just because it was one of the few games out when it launched.

803
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
Yeah.

804
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
No, it was a good guess.

805
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,360
Animal Crossing, yeah, was kind of a surprise, but the game was really big, pretty much around

806
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,360
the world.

807
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,360
I mean, they're making a movie based on it.

808
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
Come on.

809
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
It's got to be pretty big.

810
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
All right.

811
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,120
Well, good job, Bobby.

812
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,120
You did really good.

813
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,480
Four out of five is not bad, and who knew that Loki had this superhuman power?

814
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
I guess I should have guessed.

815
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,840
Since he works in distribution, you probably know something about sales figures.

816
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
I cry in shame.

817
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
I'm sorry, Bobby.

818
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
But you know what?

819
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,600
Hey, we'll give you a chance to plug your show.

820
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,160
Yeah, something you want to share about what's going on on the Bobby Black Wolf show this

821
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
week?

822
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,600
Well, on the Bobby Black Wolf show, we actually had an interview this week talking to the

823
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:50,400
organizer of the 2006 Interactive Fiction Competition, which is basically text and video

824
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,320
games done today.

825
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,960
And so the art form really has progressed, and we talked to him about the competition,

826
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,080
how you can judge, and how you can be a part of all that.

827
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,160
So I thought it was a really interesting interview.

828
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
Very cool.

829
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,320
We haven't had an interview on this program in a long time.

830
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,640
We need to get some interviews.

831
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,200
How about all games as a whole?

832
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,520
We do our show.

833
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,000
It rebroadcasts Monday nights over on All Games.

834
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,920
There's lots of other podcasters that get in on it, so sometimes there's tournaments

835
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,400
of people coming together or what have you.

836
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,240
What's new in the world of all games this week?

837
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,480
Well, we've actually added three new affiliate radio programs.

838
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
Dang!

839
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,440
We've got – that's like a mom coming home from the adoption agency saying, we adopted

840
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
triplets.

841
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,440
No, that's great, though.

842
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,800
We've got newbies.

843
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
We adopted newbies.

844
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Who's in the family now?

845
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,080
Well, we've got a Game Addict Hotline, which is a 20-minute podcast.

846
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,200
It's got some trivia in it, but it's really short every week.

847
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,760
We have Evil Avatar Radio, which is a spin-off of the Evil Avatar forums.

848
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,280
And then we also have XBL Radio, who does the Xbox Live community chats and stuff.

849
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Oh, very cool.

850
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
Well, what nights are those on?

851
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,400
Do we have a set schedule for that yet?

852
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Yeah.

853
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,760
XBL Radio is on Tuesday, Evil Avatar is on Wednesday, and Game Addict Hotline is on Thursday.

854
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
Very nice.

855
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,080
Well, congratulations to those guys.

856
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,720
We're happy to see them on board, and we'll be looking forward to that over at AllGames.com.

857
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Yep.

858
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,720
All right.

859
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,420
Bobby, thanks so much for playing our little game tonight.

860
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,920
And next time, I'll do a topic maybe about video games in Atlanta or something that Loki

861
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,720
couldn't get.

862
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,600
There wouldn't be five things in that.

863
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:22,040
Wait, I thought Atlanta was one of the top five cities for gaming right under Seattle.

864
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,040
It is.

865
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,800
But in terms of video games being based here, I think Midnight Club 3 was here, and that's

866
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,520
about it, unless you count sports games.

867
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
Hmm.

868
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
Interesting.

869
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,400
I guess they just sell a lot there.

870
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,880
You guys have to stay indoors, because it's so damn humid outside.

871
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
It's not the heat.

872
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,880
It's the stupidity.

873
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,880
All right.

874
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,880
Bobby, thanks so much for playing our game tonight.

875
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,880
We appreciate it.

876
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
Have a good one, all right?

877
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
You too.

878
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
All right.

879
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,080
Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, ladies and gentlemen, from AllGames.com, does his own program over

880
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,280
there Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

881
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,120
A lot of our live listeners actually listen to his show as a bit of a warm-up before they

882
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,920
come over to Orange Launch Radio, so that's pretty cool.

883
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
That is pretty cool.

884
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
All right.

885
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Let's go back to the news.

886
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
All right.

887
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,880
We're talking about games being leaked out early and stuff.

888
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:13,440
Well, this has to do with mod ship and HD loader programs out there, and, well, actually,

889
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,040
some of the major ones were actually nailed for over $9 million recently.

890
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,040
The ESA announced that a federal court in California ordered a group of defendants to

891
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,840
pay over $9 million in damages for violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and

892
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:40,200
the violations were against Devinio, the maker and distributor of mod ships for all consoles,

893
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:48,040
French resident Max Loem, and Canadian resident Frederic Leggett for trafficking of mod ships

894
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,320
and software circumvention device called HD loader.

895
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,960
And yeah, it's basically, of course, the HD loader, for those who might not know, was

896
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,840
a device that was available on the market for a while, allowing you to dump games to

897
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:10,440
a hard drive built into your older PlayStation 2, whether that be one that you provide or

898
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,280
the official Sony hard drive, and you can put games on there.

899
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280
I have one.

900
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,480
I love my HD loader because it allows me to play import games.

901
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,800
And it just loads things faster, too, on the HD loader.

902
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,800
It does load things faster.

903
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,400
I like not just having to switch out the disks and everything.

904
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,400
I love it.

905
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,880
I don't know how a bachelor pad looks around the TV.

906
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,920
There's disks everywhere outside of their case because we're all too damn lazy to put

907
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
it back in the right case.

908
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,600
What I liked using it for is before I got my 360, when I used to take my PlayStation

909
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,480
2 to work to play games, I didn't have to carry around like 50 disks with me.

910
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,120
They're all dumped to my hard drive, so I can just bring my PlayStation 2 and a couple

911
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,780
controllers and the hookups, and away I go.

912
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,960
And plus the load times were a lot less.

913
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,280
So in DDR, it was awesome.

914
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,400
It was like instantly into the song.

915
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,440
But it's gotten worse since then.

916
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,520
Before, when I first got it, you had a cap of 120 gigs you can pretty much use now.

917
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:12,000
Now it supports up to two terabyte drives that you can hook up via USB.

918
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,080
You can literally put almost every single game out there.

919
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,320
Yeah, but you can also go rent games and then load them on your HD loader, and then you

920
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
have them forever.

921
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,160
Not that you'd know anything about that, would you, Loki?

922
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,160
No, I wouldn't.

923
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,240
I'm beyond renting games nowadays.

924
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:34,400
Who needs the rent games when they're freely available on the internet?

925
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,360
There is a speculation going out there that the European PlayStation 3 delay, because

926
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,920
you know how the European folks, especially if you're a Sony fan over there, got screwed

927
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,880
when it comes to the PlayStation 3's release.

928
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,560
Hey, no worries, rumor is we're going to get screwed too.

929
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,920
Everybody's going to get screwed with the PlayStation 3 release, but who knows?

930
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,540
The speculation is that it could threaten US publishers.

931
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,240
Just because it's releasing late in Europe doesn't mean you won't have an impact here

932
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,880
in the United States.

933
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,320
That's 500,000 PlayStation 3's that were expected to go to Europe at the end of this year.

934
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,100
Now that's 500,000 less consumers to sell games to.

935
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,280
Publishers are probably going to delay games that they previously were going to release

936
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:21,000
this year to 2007 just to take advantage of the greater user base in Europe.

937
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,040
So they'll all get screwed by this.

938
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,240
Isn't this kind of what you were saying earlier?

939
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,600
That's for a whole different reason.

940
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,040
That's for the fact that they haven't gotten their dev kits in a timely manner and so they're

941
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,520
not able to finish the game, period.

942
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:40,680
No, I'm talking about earlier in the program you were talking about how sometimes, like

943
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,120
say the Wii sells 9 million units, I think you said this in part A, then that's 9 million

944
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,960
available systems for people to want to publish for.

945
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,040
Is it the same logic here?

946
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,600
In a sense, yes.

947
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,520
But you can't really apply, like say if there's 500,000 units in the United States, that doesn't

948
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,900
mean they're not going to release a game here.

949
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,360
If there's no systems obviously in the UK, they're going to delay the launch of a game

950
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,360
there.

951
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,480
But just because Europe doesn't have their game system yet does not mean that they won't

952
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
launch their US copies here first.

953
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,140
So not only will Europe get screwed by the release of the system, but now all their games

954
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,000
are going to be delayed six months because of this.

955
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,840
No, they'll just come out when the PlayStation 3 launches instead of just being launched

956
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
at the same time.

957
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,440
I mean, the same thing happens with different region games, like Tomb Raider will come out

958
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,760
in the UK first and then it will come out over here.

959
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,380
It does not mean, for example, we can release PlayStation 3 games here first and then just

960
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,200
wait to release them there.

961
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,420
It doesn't matter because they need time anyways to, I guess, print more copies.

962
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,000
One interesting thing though I have to add to this was that there was an interview with

963
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,200
the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe World, Vice President Jamie McDonald, and he claims

964
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,640
that Europeans don't mind that they have to wait an extra four months for the console.

965
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,560
And they asked him, what would you say to consumers who like Sony and want to buy your

966
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:11,240
product but perhaps feel because they're in Europe they will always be last in line?

967
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:16,120
And he says, European consumers have shown that historically they don't mind that because

968
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,120
they end up buying as many PlayStations, if not more, than the US and Japan.

969
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,640
In Europe it doesn't seem that the release of our platforms after the US and Japan in

970
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,840
the long run affects how consumers feel.

971
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:33,140
I think some of our listeners over in the old country might feel a little different.

972
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,000
I don't know guys, is it just me or do you feel a little different than what this guy

973
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
is saying?

974
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,680
Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.

975
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,040
So he's saying basically, well since Europe usually gets screwed, you know, we're kind

976
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,040
of used to it.

977
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,120
You know, they're assholes stretched out now, it doesn't matter if we fuck them again.

978
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,560
That's pretty much what it comes down to.

979
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:12,760
It's like kids say the darndest things, all we need now, we're just missing Bill Cosby

980
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:18,400
and we've got another show all together here.

981
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,680
I want to say this real quick before we get into the next story because there's something

982
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,040
I wanted to talk about that for whatever reason isn't on the show roll because it was actually

983
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,480
kind of a busy week for news with the whole GameStop conference and the systems coming

984
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
out soon.

985
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,560
There was a story, an opinion piece, does Sony need a figure like Major Nelson?

986
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:43,120
Because Major Nelson is sort of like the internet guy for the Xbox 360 and in a way he's kind

987
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,440
of a viral campaign in a way, you know what I mean?

988
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,540
He starts Buzz on his blog and he's a popular guy, he's on the system playing the games,

989
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,520
people have run into him on Test Drive Unlimited and stuff, and you go over to Nintendo and

990
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:08,680
you have very charismatic folks like Reggie and Miyamoto, but Sony has these guys, as

991
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,920
Jamie calls them, the crayon eaters and bike helmet, which by the way, the photoshops in

992
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,240
our forum that you guys did, fucking hilarious.

993
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,240
We have the best listeners.

994
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,960
Seriously guys, if you've never visited our website, you must go to the forums just for

995
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:28,520
the people doing the photoshops of the amazing crayon eaters over at Sony, it's great.

996
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,480
Sony has these guys that make these crazy statements like this, you know, does Sony

997
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,120
need somebody a little more hip?

998
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,760
What they need is Willy Wonka.

999
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,760
Why?

1000
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,200
Because it's going to take some fucking magic to sell those consoles.

1001
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,080
Some news about Oblivion on the PSP, and we knew that there's got to be some, you know,

1002
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,840
catch to this, they're not going to be able to put Oblivion that we saw on the 360 on

1003
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,900
the PSP, there's no fucking way.

1004
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:03,120
So what we did find out though, according to the, you know, that certain website's magazine,

1005
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,600
the official PlayStation magazine, there is actually some info regarding the game, including

1006
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:14,600
that it still has the create a character mode in it, but it will only have a few dungeons

1007
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,360
that you get to play in, there's no open running around and whatnot to actually play through

1008
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
the game.

1009
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,120
But, you know, they're going to have some, they're talking to me.

1010
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,920
Is any of it new, or are they just recycled dungeons from the existing Oblivion?

1011
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,920
No idea.

1012
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,600
If so, I mean, what the hell is the point?

1013
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,480
It reminds me of those Game Boy Mortal Kombat games, which are fucking horrible compared

1014
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,320
to the console ones, it's like, you know, we had to take out half the moves because

1015
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,240
there's only two buttons and things like that.

1016
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,840
I mean, granted the graphics for this Oblivion look kind of nice, but this is a game that

1017
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,080
should just simply be played on the big screen, or on a computer screen.

1018
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,080
Yeah, I'm...

1019
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,080
I don't know.

1020
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,920
I don't know, but I will suspend disbelief until I actually get to play, get my hands

1021
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,280
on it and actually play it, but I worry about this whole concept.

1022
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,340
I mean, at least do, why not like a little spinoff story?

1023
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,280
Do some slightly different dungeons and do like a spinoff story, I think that would be

1024
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,280
a lot more...

1025
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,280
Yeah.

1026
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,280
Well...

1027
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,280
Wantable.

1028
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:17,840
Yeah, it's interesting, but I don't know, the game itself looks pretty, I mean, not

1029
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,920
as good as obviously the 360 one, but I don't know, it looks okay, and like you mentioned,

1030
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,040
you know, cutting out skills and stuff, 18 of the original game's 21 skills are going

1031
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,280
to be in the game, a couple of them stripped out.

1032
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,920
I don't know, it's basically, why don't they just release like a 3D version of Diablo?

1033
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,120
It's kind of like what this game is almost like, you know, where you pick up items and

1034
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,760
just kind of grind at it.

1035
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,760
Oh, I'm sure Diablo 3 will be something we're hearing about in 2007, so that's just my thought.

1036
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,760
I swear I have not been ignoring you, chat room, over at orangelongeradio.com, click

1037
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,700
on chat, my mind just got distracted with trying to set up that game and everything

1038
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,040
a little bit ago, but it looks like Bobby Black Wolf is actually campaigning right now

1039
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,320
to be the voice of Sony, so he'll get up there and be the voice of Sony.

1040
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,160
I'll send you some Crayolas, Black Wolf, so you can start practicing, and then DMN

1041
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,560
follows up with a Nokia needs Bobby Black Wolf, you know, the N-Gage needs a spokesman

1042
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
too.

1043
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,200
The problem with this, I mean, I really have trouble with them pushing games like the Eye

1044
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,440
of Judgment, because it's going to take an elaborate setup to get to work, and to be

1045
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,000
honest, the Eye Toy didn't work all that great, and just a lot of the games that are

1046
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,680
coming out at launch, like Resistance, okay, it's a first person shooter that takes place

1047
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,840
during World War II, which also happens to come out at the same time as Call of Duty

1048
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,280
3, which is a first person shooter, takes place during World War II, granted one's

1049
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:49,000
sci-fi, I mean, whatever, okay, so that's neat, but it's got some major competition.

1050
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,040
You've got Lair, which is coming out, it's a dragon riding game, coming out also same

1051
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,280
month as Aragon, which is also a dragon riding game, also dragon garden stuff, I mean, it's

1052
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:05,520
a cool looking game, and then, you know, Motorstorm, which I don't even think is a launch title,

1053
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,960
I know, and then they've got all the EA Sports games, and Carbon, you know, you first pick

1054
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,640
Carbon, which is actually a pretty cool game, play the demo, and then the 2K Sports games,

1055
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,360
but like, as far as exclusive titles, I mean, there's not a whole lot, and I think that's

1056
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,600
really going to hurt them more than the fact that the console is three, you know, fucking

1057
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,760
expensive and that there's not that many units out there, I think that there's, you know,

1058
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,240
people that are like, actually going to want, I mean, there'll be people that pick up the

1059
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,960
console, but a lot of people are like, well, I'm just going to wait until some more games

1060
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
come out.

1061
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,800
Well, Sony fans, if you feel differently, send Loki an email, mailbag at orangeontrader.com.

1062
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Meanwhile, let's move on to something for the Nintendo fans, and this is a little bit

1063
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,240
more disappointment, I mean, we already heard about the consoles are definitely going to

1064
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:55,520
be region locked, well, guess what, Eurogamer talked to a Nintendo UK spokesperson and they

1065
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,640
confirmed that the Wii Virtual Console games will also be region locked.

1066
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,680
The Virtual Console games will also not be universal, meaning that Eurogamers will get

1067
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,020
Euro versions of the old games, so whether or not this means certain regions will have

1068
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,960
to do without certain titles is unknown, but most likely, I mean, certain games were big

1069
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,700
in Japan that weren't big over here.

1070
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,500
The reason why I sound so depressed about this is because now I'm never going to get

1071
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:25,520
my MSX games here in America, unless, well, obviously emulators and stuff, but come on,

1072
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,120
I want to play the original Metal Gear, or Gardick.

1073
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,120
Metal Gear here?

1074
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,440
No, but the old school MSX, it was on the MSX before it was on the NES.

1075
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,080
Well, and the true sequel to Metal Gear was not Snake's Revenge, but the true sequel to

1076
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,680
Metal Gear was only on the MSX, but I get, well, they had the whole PlayStation 2 secret

1077
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,200
thing, but whatever, I want it on the Virtual Console.

1078
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,000
Gimme!

1079
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,480
That's why I sound depressed, sorry.

1080
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,780
I'm not too worried about it, I mean, big deal, I didn't play a lot of the import

1081
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,680
games on the NES, and whatever, I mean, it's not like they were going to put all the games

1082
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,840
on there anyways, I mean, so, you know, do I really need a Japanese version of Zelda

1083
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
on there?

1084
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
No.

1085
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,680
Rama speculates maybe you can get a Japanese Wii Connect 24 account.

1086
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,960
Black Boy says he was looking forward to Doki Doki, right, Doki Doki Panic, the inspiration

1087
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,960
for Super Mario Bros. 2?

1088
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,480
Well, I mean, the consoles themselves are probably region locked, but I'm sure you

1089
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,760
could probably, like, disable it or change that to something else, you know?

1090
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,720
Well, it's very easy to get a Japanese Xbox 360 account, so maybe that same logic, but

1091
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,680
at the same time, it's hard to pay for that, you know what I mean?

1092
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,760
Like, you can't really, like, you only get the Japanese accounts, you can download their

1093
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,640
free demos and trailers, but you can't, you know, buy things on their store, really.

1094
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,680
Well, luckily, there's no real money involved, it's basically the Nintendo Points cards,

1095
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,360
or points, and you know what, you can still do that.

1096
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,600
And what if the points cards were region locked?

1097
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,600
No.

1098
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,040
Only the Amer- No, the points cards are just universal.

1099
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,640
And what's interesting, though, see, like, there is going to be some Xbox Live games

1100
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,720
that are exclusive to Japan, and I was going to buy them on my one account because you

1101
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:03,560
can actually play them on your, you know, U.S. account, too, so I would download the

1102
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,000
demo on my Japanese account and register them on my U.S. account.

1103
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,400
GS68 says I want the Famicom version of Gradius 2.

1104
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,800
See, all these great games that really didn't ever come over here, and I, Nintendo, I think

1105
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:22,560
you ought to reconsider this, or at least, if you're going to do this, please give the

1106
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,480
U.S. gamers a shot at some of these games they never played, I bet there's, you know,

1107
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,480
money to be made there.

1108
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,160
Well, I think a lot of this, though, is going to be to eliminate confusion, I mean, if you're,

1109
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,880
you know, a normal consumer out there, I mean, what if you don't want to download the Japanese

1110
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,560
version of a certain game, and you might accidentally do that, and then you've wasted your money

1111
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,560
on this game?

1112
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:45,200
I mean, there's no amount of clear marketing that's going to stop stupid people from, you

1113
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,760
know, injuring themselves or downloading something they shouldn't be.

1114
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,160
All right, I'm done being emo.

1115
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,440
You know, there's not anymore you can do, but whatever.

1116
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,520
Some interesting stuff, though, Reggie over in Nintendo there is contradicting some of

1117
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:06,200
the info we've gotten about the pricing for the, you know, the web browser for the Wii,

1118
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,560
and, you know, his comments were basically, in fairness for the Americas, we haven't made

1119
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:15,160
the business decision for how and what we're going to do with the browser.

1120
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,400
We recognize for most people browser is pretty standard, the concept of charging a significant

1121
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,840
amount of Wii points to get the browser is somewhat challenging.

1122
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,760
We're going to work through that.

1123
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:29,400
So basically saying, you know, we haven't announced anything yet about it.

1124
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:34,760
I don't know why they would charge for the browser, that's kind of weird, but whatever.

1125
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,000
I mean, if it's like a buck or something, I guess you're paying for licensing maybe

1126
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,440
for Opera, I mean, I don't know.

1127
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,200
Make it ad supported or something, I don't know.

1128
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,960
There is a third party Wiimote coming out, Pelican is making it.

1129
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:57,000
This is very interesting because, you know, the Wiimote is an expensive piece of equipment,

1130
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,120
is what, like 50 bucks, 40, 50 bucks it's retailing for?

1131
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,120
$39.99.

1132
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,120
$39.99.

1133
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,840
It's very interesting that a third party is going to jump in and try to make their own

1134
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,980
version of the Wiimote, but usually third party controllers aren't quite as good as

1135
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,980
first party.

1136
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,520
For me, I kind of go, uh-oh, if I were Nintendo, I'd be concerned about this because this is

1137
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,960
kind of like market saturation, isn't it?

1138
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,520
Well, they're the ones that have to approve it.

1139
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,520
Well, I guess that's true.

1140
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,560
I bet it won't come out right away, that's for sure.

1141
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,640
I don't know, great, but I don't know.

1142
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,600
It's a little scary because a lot of the, especially the wireless controllers, you know,

1143
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,640
they kind of suck, but whatever.

1144
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,480
Anyway, Ari Masan says, Nintendo will sue.

1145
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,320
There's some controversy now, this is about the dumbest things too, about the light on

1146
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:49,520
the front of the Wii surrounding the disk drive, whether it's going to be on or off.

1147
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,120
During the Nintendo Fusion Tour, there's actually the light was completely turned off and some

1148
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,720
people are like, well, hey, I want my light on, you know, what the hell?

1149
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,040
That's my theory on this whole thing.

1150
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,000
Basically what they've come out and said, the rep, was that the light's only going to

1151
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,600
be on when you put a disk in or when you turn the console on and that it's going to turn

1152
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,600
off later on.

1153
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:16,880
I think there's either going to be an option to keep it on or the fact that probably those

1154
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,840
games that you were playing weren't running on that Wii, they were probably running on

1155
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:27,160
a dev kit that was below the Wii and that the system just wasn't plugged in.

1156
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:31,760
Now I was going to say, when we went to the Konami thing, didn't we see Elibits, the thing

1157
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,080
was glowing the whole time?

1158
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,080
Yeah, exactly.

1159
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,080
But of course that same logic could apply, it could have been hooked up to a dev kit,

1160
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,080
doesn't mean shit.

1161
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:43,440
And they could have just had the console plugged in and turned on and so the light glows, but

1162
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,800
if it's hooked, you're actually playing off of a dev kit and not the actual system.

1163
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,760
So in theory you could just, if you're limited on plugs or whatever for power, you could

1164
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:58,000
just not plug that in and just set that there because it's just for the illusion that you're

1165
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,600
playing with the actual Wii and not a dev kit, whereas some people, like Sony, just

1166
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,000
like to put the rackmount servers out there for everyone to see.

1167
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,880
Alright, that makes sense.

1168
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,120
Alright, well we'll see what happens.

1169
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,640
Alright, well we are going to go now to the portion of the show where you guys get to

1170
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,120
help out and that is by the Skype line.

1171
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,640
Just head on over to orangelauntrady.com, click on interact with us and you can learn

1172
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,600
about how to call us here live.

1173
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,560
Our username on Skype is orangelauntrady or you can always pick up the phone and call

1174
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,560
us, 916-226-9067.

1175
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:35,400
Can't remember if I mentioned it last week, but there is an 800 number coming soon because

1176
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,960
the number we have now is not toll free, but by the end of the month we're going to have

1177
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,840
a toll free number, which is very exciting.

1178
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,920
I'm very much looking forward to that.

1179
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,920
And then we'll have a lot more folks wanting to call in, I'm sure, and we'll probably bring

1180
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,240
back voicemails of the week at that point because we think more of you guys might want

1181
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,720
to contribute if you have a toll free number to use because most of you are just too lazy

1182
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,720
for Skype, I guess.

1183
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,720
Let's go to the phones.

1184
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,680
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1185
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,680
Who's this?

1186
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,680
Hi, it's Rama.

1187
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,680
What's up, guys?

1188
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,680
Hi, Rama.

1189
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
How you doing?

1190
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,680
What's on your mind?

1191
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,680
Not much, not much.

1192
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,440
I'm trying to quote the last part of the show, but I just got back from another anime convention.

1193
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,600
Another anime convention?

1194
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,600
Which one this time?

1195
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,600
It's manga.

1196
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,560
It's nothing but a convention about manga and fans and stuff like that.

1197
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,560
So no video games?

1198
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:23,240
Yes, there were video games, there were no tournaments, but let's just say older gamers

1199
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,480
like us would have cried tears of joy at the games that were there.

1200
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,000
What did they bring?

1201
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,200
Well, we saw a working Nintendo set up with Super Mario Bros. 3.

1202
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,200
That's pretty hot.

1203
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Did they have Guardian Legend?

1204
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,200
No, they don't have that.

1205
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,840
They're the guys that ran the game and told them next year.

1206
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,840
All right.

1207
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,840
That works for me.

1208
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,480
Anything else you want to share about the con?

1209
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,480
What else?

1210
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:50,440
It was fun and it was basically drama-free because everybody just had to have a good

1211
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,440
time.

1212
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,440
There was no...

1213
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,760
Nobody bashing Orange Moms Radio to you this year?

1214
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,720
No, not this year, not this year.

1215
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,920
We love our anime fans that go to the conventions and then bash us to other people.

1216
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,920
That's lovely.

1217
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,920
No, I'm done.

1218
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,920
I'm just using...

1219
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,920
No one disagrees.

1220
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,920
It's cool.

1221
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,920
Whatever.

1222
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,360
People have their varying opinions.

1223
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,880
There's about 500 video game podcasts out there.

1224
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,600
If you don't like this one, go find another one.

1225
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,600
Just make...

1226
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,600
Keep it independent is all we ask.

1227
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,600
Definitely.

1228
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
Of course.

1229
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
All right.

1230
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,600
Anything else you want to share?

1231
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,600
Let's talk about the games.

1232
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:30,040
There's a few Super Nintendo set up, a couple of PlayStation, and yes, there was Guitar

1233
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,280
Hero on the big screen.

1234
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,280
There was what?

1235
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,640
Guitar Hero on the big screen.

1236
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,320
Oh, Guitar Hero on the big screen.

1237
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
How did that go over?

1238
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,140
That was pretty nice.

1239
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:45,200
That and DDR Extreme 2 were the top five.

1240
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,960
You also had Nairochimate Hero 4 and Battle Station D.O.N. are also popular.

1241
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,440
All right.

1242
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,080
Well, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, okay?

1243
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,080
Excellent.

1244
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,080
All right.

1245
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,520
Have a good one and we hope for some more old school gaming goodness at the next con.

1246
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,520
Game right.

1247
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,520
All right.

1248
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,520
See you guys later.

1249
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,520
Later.

1250
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,040
Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.

1251
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,040
Hello.

1252
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,040
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1253
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,040
Yes.

1254
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,040
Hey.

1255
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,040
This is Al Mullet calling.

1256
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,040
Hey.

1257
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
We remember you.

1258
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,200
You haven't called into this show in a long time.

1259
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,400
How are you, Al Mullet?

1260
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,960
I am doing just fine, Sky.

1261
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,960
I'm doing just fine.

1262
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,600
Have you ever called into the podcast?

1263
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,600
I don't think so.

1264
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,600
No.

1265
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,800
This is my first podcast call.

1266
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,800
Your podcast debut.

1267
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,400
I know you used to listen to the three-hour show back in the day.

1268
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,540
Oh, yes.

1269
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,540
That was fun times.

1270
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,980
Now, from one of the crazy random times, no, that's great.

1271
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:34,980
We love our history.

1272
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,600
Now, you're getting married next week, right?

1273
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Yes, I am.

1274
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,600
Yes, I am.

1275
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,600
Congratulations.

1276
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,600
Thank you very much.

1277
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Is she a gamer?

1278
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,600
Slightly.

1279
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
I am learning her.

1280
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,600
Okay.

1281
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,600
All right.

1282
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
That's good.

1283
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
There's got to be compromise in a relationship, right, Logie?

1284
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,600
Exactly.

1285
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,600
Right, Logie?

1286
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,680
We're mostly DS playing.

1287
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,000
We do New Super Mario Brothers versus.

1288
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,400
We do Tetris versus.

1289
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,400
Okay.

1290
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Well, that's cool.

1291
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
That's cool.

1292
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,400
What did you want to call in about tonight?

1293
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,400
What's up?

1294
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,660
I basically wanted to say hi.

1295
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,660
It's been a while.

1296
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,660
It's your hand.

1297
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,360
Are you still doing your column over at Inside Pulse?

1298
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,200
Actually, hey, I have, quote, unquote, left Inside Pulse.

1299
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,920
There's just been a lot of stuff going on.

1300
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,920
I see.

1301
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,560
I'm trying to find work, and obviously the marriage thing.

1302
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:27,080
I mean, things have just been, lots of stuff been going on, and I've been trying to catch

1303
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,160
up on everything recently.

1304
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
I understand.

1305
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,320
Lives go through chaos sometimes.

1306
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,320
It's fully understandable.

1307
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,000
Well, what games have you been playing recently?

1308
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,520
Did you check out DDR Supernova?

1309
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
Oh, yes.

1310
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,800
I've been having a blast with that game.

1311
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,800
Yeah?

1312
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:45,800
There are a few songs I could have done without, but I like the setup of Stellar Master Mode.

1313
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:54,480
I really like the fact, I think it's the best, what's the word, console licenses.

1314
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,760
I think it's the best lineup thus far, especially songs like The Other Side, Turn Up the Music,

1315
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,520
L.E.F., A Lot of Electronic Ferocious, and Shivers.

1316
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,160
Shivers is awesome.

1317
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,360
How do you think the game compares to the other PlayStation 2 releases that are out

1318
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,360
there?

1319
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,360
It's kind of interesting.

1320
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,040
I was just at Target the other day, and they had a DDR Supernova bundle right next to Extreme

1321
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,200
2 bundles they still hadn't sold.

1322
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Definitely options are still available to the new DDR folks that want to get on board

1323
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,200
with this.

1324
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,640
How do you think it compares to the other ones?

1325
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:33,480
Well, I definitely think that it's definitely on par with Extreme 2 as far as best US PS2

1326
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,480
mix.

1327
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:40,360
There's definitely stuff on there that make me go, wow, this is much better, but then

1328
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:44,560
there are other things that make me go, hey, it was better in Extreme 2.

1329
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:51,280
I think the course mode, we got shafted with course mode this time, because there's only

1330
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,560
one difficulty level on everything, whereas last game, you had two difficulty levels on

1331
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,560
everything.

1332
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,560
Interesting.

1333
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,120
What do you think about how the new Xbox games are shaping up?

1334
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,000
I think they're shaping up really well.

1335
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,640
Their podcasts are definitely making them more favorable by the day.

1336
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,680
I appreciate that, and I'll let Konami know you said that.

1337
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:17,600
No, seriously though, if you were still reviewing games for the website, how many stars out

1338
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,480
of ten would you be given DDR Supernova?

1339
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:24,000
DDR Supernova, well, that would be under the ten category review system.

1340
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:33,200
I gave Extreme 2 a 7.5, and said that was the best one ever, which is like a 9.0 on

1341
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,160
other websites.

1342
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:43,840
I would say that Supernova would range between a 7.0, 7.5, because there's stuff that's better

1343
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,720
and there's stuff that's worse, so it would be around the same score, I would think.

1344
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,720
What's up with that?

1345
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,760
You brought up an interesting point, is that a 7.5, the way you would review games, and

1346
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:59,600
if I wrote game reviews, I would hope I would be very similar as well, where an average

1347
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,320
game gets an average score in the middle.

1348
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,880
But it seems like most game websites, you're right, kind of skew it towards the high end.

1349
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,440
Here's what I would get.

1350
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:16,040
For example, games that are reviewed on IGN, they'll have a score for each category, and

1351
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,320
the score doesn't have anything to do with any category on there.

1352
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:25,560
So for example, a game might score 7.5s across the board on all the other categories and

1353
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,400
get a 6 overall.

1354
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,160
Like okay, how the hell does that average out?

1355
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,680
Or I'm thinking about Rotten Tomatoes, because they cover game reviews, they don't do it

1356
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,400
quite as well as they do movies, but it says we only give a fresh rating if the site gave

1357
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:44,240
it a 7 or better, because of the skewed people tend to give higher scores on game reviews.

1358
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,400
Why do you think that is, Emily?

1359
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:51,880
The problem is that so many of these numbers are pulled directly out of their asses, and

1360
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,400
most of these numbers don't even correspond to what their written opinions are on the

1361
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,400
game.

1362
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:03,160
There are 7.0s on some sites and on some game reviews, and the bottom line is don't play

1363
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,160
this.

1364
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:08,600
It's the way that Inside Pulse reviews games.

1365
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:15,960
It's out of a 10-category system, and it could really excel in some areas, but there are

1366
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,000
other areas that could bring the game down.

1367
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,080
A game could have a great story, but horrible graphics and sound.

1368
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:25,360
The game could have great gameplay mechanics, but it could only be fun for the first three

1369
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:35,080
hours and basically the games have to be really awesome in all categories to get 8 and above,

1370
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:39,080
but a game can be worth playing at a 7 or even a 6.

1371
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,240
Alright, yeah, that's true.

1372
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:48,200
I was going to say, I hope to see that you come back to the internet soon reviewing games

1373
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:53,360
and sticking to the more realistic scale that you started over there.

1374
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,640
You just might see a Supernova review before the end of the week, assuming I have enough

1375
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,640
time.

1376
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,640
Very cool.

1377
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Well, El Mullet, I've got to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you

1378
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,940
so much for calling in.

1379
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,940
Thank you.

1380
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:04,940
Have a good one, buddy.

1381
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:05,940
You too.

1382
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,940
Alright, bye-bye.

1383
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:07,940
Bye.

1384
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,280
How exciting, a wedding, getting married and all that fun stuff.

1385
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,280
Let's go to another call.

1386
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,800
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1387
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,800
Who's this?

1388
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
Ultimate Gamer from chat.

1389
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,520
Well, I'm currently not in chat right now.

1390
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,000
Alright, well hello Ultimate Gamer.

1391
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

1392
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:31,520
Yeah, I'm just thinking about the Xbox 360 and now it has a $200 HD DVD drive, and am

1393
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:38,120
I just going to have to... Should I just get a PS3?

1394
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:46,600
Because since the Blu-ray drive is implemented into the PS3 and games are actually on Blu-ray

1395
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,600
discs.

1396
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,600
Gotcha.

1397
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,600
Okay, I see.

1398
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,600
Here's the thing, though.

1399
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,920
Are you interested in just playing movies with this device, or are you going to be playing

1400
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,040
games as well?

1401
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:04,360
I mean, I'm mostly getting the PS3 for games, but I know the Xbox 360 has some good games.

1402
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,360
Right.

1403
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,260
Because the PS3s are actually on Blu-ray discs.

1404
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:13,600
I think it really boils down to which console has the games that you want, and Microsoft

1405
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,400
gets a lot of heat usually because they overlook, or at least they have in the past, they don't

1406
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,280
have a lot of solid role-playing type games.

1407
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,020
They don't have a lot of solid action games, and they've been trying to correct that.

1408
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:28,400
You've got Blue Dragon coming out, and they had Cameo.

1409
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,860
Take that for whatever it's worth, but Sony's always excelled in that range, but on the

1410
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:37,840
flip side, Sony doesn't seem to have a strong lineup right now, so you have to look more

1411
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,900
into the future at what Sony's got, and Microsoft is trying to correct themselves, and you saw

1412
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,320
that with Tokyo Game Show.

1413
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,260
They're trying to take a more broad approach to different games, so you really have to

1414
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:51,640
ask yourself, which of these two systems is going to have the games I want to play?

1415
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,040
Because remember what we always say, the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as

1416
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,480
the games that are on it, and when it comes down to the whole, I guess here's another

1417
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,780
question I have for you.

1418
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,560
Where does the Wii stand in your mind?

1419
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,880
Do you not care about the Wii?

1420
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,880
Heck no.

1421
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,520
I mean, the Wii is one of them.

1422
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,440
I'm definitely going to get the Wii at launch.

1423
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,840
Right, but the thing is, the Wii doesn't have any of that, and the Wiis not have a Blu-ray

1424
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
player.

1425
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,220
Hell, it doesn't even have a DVD player.

1426
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,160
So that system is really about the games.

1427
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:21,320
You are buying that system for the games and the games only.

1428
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,560
So I would say take that same logic and put it on Xbox 360 versus Playstation 3, because

1429
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,120
it's not really going to matter Blu-ray, HD, DVD, whatever.

1430
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,760
It's going to be really about the games in the end.

1431
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,760
I'm going to be honest.

1432
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,160
I've seen Blu-ray and HD DVD side-by-side.

1433
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,340
It's really not that much different.

1434
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:39,240
The spec-wise, they're about the same too, other than data.

1435
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,480
But I do understand what you're saying is that Sony, and I do agree this could be to

1436
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,960
their advantage in three years, is that Sony has the native Blu-ray support for the games,

1437
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,880
and while right now it's causing the system to cost your first-born child, later on, when

1438
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,700
we get further down within the subdivisions of this generation, that could really benefit

1439
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:01,700
them in the end.

1440
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:06,960
But I don't know, for me, I'm kind of like, well then I'll buy the PS3 when it's got those

1441
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,960
games.

1442
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:14,160
Well, what I'm saying is with the Blu-ray disc, it's going to actually be a high-definition

1443
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:19,920
disc, whereas the Xbox 360, it's just like having an HDTV will make the game high-definition.

1444
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,920
True.

1445
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,920
That's true.

1446
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,660
But also, don't forget, the other part I'm trying to say here is that doesn't it boil

1447
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,760
down to how good the games are, though?

1448
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,920
Not necessarily how they look, because being on Blu-ray, certainly they're going to look

1449
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,920
better.

1450
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,020
But if you're going to buy a Wii, then you must already be into that school of thought

1451
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,400
that it really is about the fun games.

1452
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:45,400
And granted that Blu-ray does have more storage available to it, doesn't mean, though, that

1453
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,480
they'll use it all, and also doesn't mean that the games that are on DVD-9s are going

1454
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,300
to look any less brilliant than, say, a PlayStation 3 game.

1455
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,040
Look at Gears of War and Resistance, perfect example.

1456
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:59,760
They both look very good, and one's on DVD, one's on Blu-ray.

1457
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,240
It's just compression technology and whatnot.

1458
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,920
Don't shop based on specs, shop on what games are good, what you're looking for to get out

1459
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:14,040
of the system, because if you shop on specs, it's just going to be ridiculous.

1460
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,120
Here's my closing thought for you, I suppose, Ultimate Gamer.

1461
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:23,200
After all, your name is Ultimate Gamer, get a second job and buy them both.

1462
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,320
I'm just messing with you, but I know you're probably right now.

1463
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:31,840
You want one this year, and maybe you'll get the other one next year?

1464
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,720
Probably I know I'm getting the Wii first.

1465
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:42,440
The PS3, I get a couple months down the road, but I think the games, they should be like

1466
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:47,160
fully enough, but also good graphics.

1467
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,160
You know what?

1468
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,160
I think you're on the right track, then.

1469
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,760
If the Wii is, it sounds like you really, really, really want the Wii, then go for that,

1470
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,640
buy that, and then when you have enough money saved up for a second console, look at the

1471
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,080
games that are out and or coming out and make your decision at that time.

1472
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,440
Yeah, all right.

1473
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
All right.

1474
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Thanks, really love the show, and a great RSS feed.

1475
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:10,000
I listen to it on my PSP every week, and I get no buffering signs or anything.

1476
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Love it.

1477
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,560
I'm glad to hear there's people still using OLRPSP.com, so, Loki, go update it.

1478
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,560
It's all right.

1479
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,560
Thank you.

1480
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,560
We appreciate it.

1481
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,160
I know sometimes we give the PSP a hard time on this show, but it is a great multimedia

1482
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:28,160
multi-platform system, and we're really glad to be able to offer our podcast on it.

1483
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,160
All right.

1484
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,160
All right, have a good one, buddy.

1485
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,160
Bye-bye.

1486
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,160
All right, bye-bye.

1487
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,160
Bye-bye.

1488
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,160
That was a good call.

1489
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,160
All right.

1490
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,160
Let's go to another call here.

1491
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,160
All right.

1492
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
Hi.

1493
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,160
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1494
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,160
Who's this?

1495
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,160
Am I on?

1496
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,160
Yes, you are.

1497
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,160
Sorry about that.

1498
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,160
It's Legend of Zaku.

1499
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,160
Hi, buddy.

1500
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,160
What's on your mind?

1501
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,160
Digitalize next week.

1502
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,160
I know it is, and I'm not going.

1503
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,160
I'm missing it by a week.

1504
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,160
Wait.

1505
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,160
Wasn't it this week?

1506
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,160
No.

1507
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,160
It's this weekend.

1508
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,160
Oh, gotcha.

1509
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,160
Okay.

1510
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,160
I just, you know.

1511
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:06,280
Yeah, I'm missing it by one week.

1512
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,280
I know.

1513
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:11,080
I should be able to dig you up some information on whatever you like.

1514
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,080
We want to hear it all.

1515
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,880
We want to hear from all the New York listeners next week that are going to this.

1516
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,840
Yeah, I will report back since I'm competing.

1517
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,840
All right.

1518
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,840
So, great.

1519
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,840
It's all next week.

1520
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,840
What do you want to talk about now?

1521
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,080
Well, basically, I mean Nintendo's doing a lot of good things with the Wii, but then

1522
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:33,160
all the good things end up turning up sour, you know, when you really think about it.

1523
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:38,160
The whole having to lock down, you know, region, regioning on, you know, the games and the

1524
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,160
virtual console.

1525
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,960
Isn't that going to hurt them in the long run?

1526
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:47,160
Well, I agree it sucks and all, but you know, the NES was region locked too.

1527
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,800
Yeah, but that was easy to get, you know.

1528
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,000
It wasn't as, that was then.

1529
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:59,320
I mean, when you have the PS3 being region free, couldn't they just compete on that?

1530
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,840
I don't, I got to be honest with you.

1531
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:07,060
I know the folks that listen to this show because the way myself, Loki, and Dark Soccer

1532
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:12,040
are is that we are focused a lot on import gaming and we really do enjoy a lot of the

1533
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,680
games that come over here from Japan.

1534
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,760
So from our perspective, yeah, it's really fucked up that Nintendo's not supporting the

1535
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,760
region.

1536
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:23,360
I mean, if you had, if you had like a single version of a game without having to do any,

1537
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:29,760
you know, any, any porting, any extra work and try to localize it to a particular country,

1538
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,200
you know, rather, you know, rather doing the languages the first time, wouldn't that make

1539
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,840
more sense than just releasing one copy?

1540
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,020
Well, that's a lot of work though, because you have to do all those different languages

1541
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,020
and things.

1542
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:46,400
I mean, if you have French for parts of Canada, Japanese, but that's, you know, but just keeping

1543
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,520
that in the single source.

1544
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,920
Maybe but, but here's, okay.

1545
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:59,920
Here's my other question for you would be then about the Wii, what, what's the, okay,

1546
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,280
what about the, the greater gamer culture out there besides just us, the rabid, you

1547
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,280
know, import gamers?

1548
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,280
Are they going to give a shit?

1549
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:11,280
Yeah, casual gamers won't give a crap about, about what we're bitching about.

1550
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,640
I mean, that's a, that's a fact.

1551
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:19,640
Casual gamers just want to play, period, and so what the Wii does is gives them that opportunity

1552
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,440
to just play, which is basically Nintendo's banking on right now.

1553
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,780
They're just banking on the, on the casual gamers to, to pretty much, you know, dominate

1554
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:28,940
this holiday season.

1555
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:32,340
So my question is in the big picture, will it really make a difference that they've region

1556
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,720
locked out?

1557
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,720
Not really.

1558
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,880
It would affect some, but then Nintendo wouldn't care because that, because our, our niche

1559
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,160
minority is not their bottom line.

1560
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:47,520
Their bottom line is about everyone, the casual gamer included.

1561
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,840
Interesting comment in our chat room, Ari Masin says, I'm a large importer.

1562
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,320
I might buy two Wiis just to play both Japanese and American games.

1563
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,400
Well, Nintendo just one off you.

1564
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,920
Well, that's basically what people did when the PS2 first came out.

1565
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,920
Yeah, that's what I did.

1566
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,840
Hey, Sony made it twice off me, so whatever.

1567
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,800
And you know, who knows?

1568
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,320
There might be a way to just crack the Wii like they did with the GameCube to play imports.

1569
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,320
Oh, we'll see.

1570
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,360
And so you got to get those technologies, you got to give those opportunities time.

1571
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,360
All right.

1572
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,120
All right, Zach, who, anything, any of the thoughts for our listeners?

1573
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,680
Basically New York people, Digital Life this Friday, Saturday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

1574
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,680
Sunday.

1575
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,280
Who's, where's a good meetup spot at Digital Life?

1576
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,880
Basically I'm not really sure.

1577
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,320
Maybe maybe in the front lobby of the Javits Center.

1578
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,320
All right.

1579
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,800
So maybe on the, or maybe inside the DDR machine, maybe in the DDR tournament area.

1580
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,800
All right.

1581
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,040
Orange Loungers, Orange Loungers, be at the DDR machine Saturday at noon.

1582
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,040
Mm-hmm.

1583
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,520
All right.

1584
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,520
The OLR meetup.

1585
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:51,280
Yes, the OLR meetup right there with the DDR tournament.

1586
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,280
All right.

1587
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,280
It's Saturday at noon.

1588
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,280
All right.

1589
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,280
Have fun.

1590
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,280
Be there.

1591
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,280
Okay.

1592
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,280
All right.

1593
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,280
Later, Zachu.

1594
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,280
Bye.

1595
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,280
Bye-bye.

1596
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,280
One more call.

1597
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,280
Last call.

1598
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1599
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,280
Who's this?

1600
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,280
It's DMA.

1601
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,280
How's it going, guys?

1602
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,280
God damn, you get through every week.

1603
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,280
You know?

1604
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,280
All right.

1605
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,280
Well, what's up, DMN?

1606
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,520
I'm actually calling with a, well, now having heard that last call, I have something else.

1607
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,800
But the first thing is a little brief review of Clubhouse Games for the DS.

1608
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,080
I want Clubhouse Games.

1609
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,600
I totally forgot about this game until somebody was talking about it in chat earlier.

1610
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,360
Dude, the only reason I want to get this game is because you can pick the chat over the

1611
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,360
internet.

1612
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,360
No, no, you can't.

1613
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,360
Oh, fuck.

1614
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,360
That's it.

1615
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,360
I'm not buying it.

1616
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,960
Fucking Nintendo, that's what you get.

1617
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,480
You can pick the chat over local Wi-Fi while you're playing.

1618
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,760
Well, I can do that already.

1619
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,600
You can't do pick the chat while you're playing a game, though.

1620
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,680
I can do it while I'm playing ping-pals.

1621
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:47,240
Well, I'm sorry you bought that.

1622
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,880
No, it was a gift.

1623
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,680
It was a very nice gift.

1624
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,680
But fuck that game.

1625
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,680
Seriously.

1626
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,680
I'm sorry.

1627
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,680
I'm sorry that I was bought for you.

1628
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:55,680
That's like, no, no, no.

1629
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,600
I mean, it was a very sweet person that gave it to me.

1630
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,020
I'm not saying anything negative about the game, but seriously, it was like getting a

1631
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:03,760
fruitcake for Christmas, okay?

1632
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,400
You know grandma loves you, but you got a damn fruitcake.

1633
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,240
Yeah, well, Clubhouse Games is really cool.

1634
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:15,360
What's really awesome about it is with the Wi-Fi mode, you can play all of the multiplayer

1635
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,800
games online, which is like about 36, I think, when I come to it.

1636
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,800
Now, see, that's cool to me.

1637
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:26,080
Yeah, and it's great because I'm a casual gamer as well as a hardcore gamer.

1638
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,320
I love playing like checkers, chess, whatever.

1639
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,160
So this is fun for me because I can play with my friends all around the world, and at the

1640
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,520
same time, it's games I know how to play.

1641
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,520
Cool.

1642
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,400
Now, what other kind of like features does this have kind of souped up with the games?

1643
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,960
You know, there's like 30 some odd games, which I suppose is a big selling point, but

1644
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,200
what are some other features that might sell this game to people?

1645
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:51,920
The fact that it's under the Touch Generations label, which is Nintendo's label for games

1646
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,800
anyone can pick up and play.

1647
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,460
So you could, sorry, lost some thought there.

1648
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:05,840
You could pick up anything on this and immediately want to play it, and from what I hear, it

1649
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
might be affordable.

1650
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,440
I hear it might retail at the very most expensive $29.99.

1651
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,440
Interesting.

1652
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,880
Loki, do you know how much that's retailing for?

1653
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,880
What thing?

1654
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,880
Clubhouse games?

1655
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,880
Do you know how much that's going for?

1656
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,320
Things like, I want to say $19.99 or something.

1657
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,320
Oh, okay.

1658
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,320
That'd be nice.

1659
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,320
That's a really good deal if that's true.

1660
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,640
I can't remember off the top of my head.

1661
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,000
If you give me a second, I can check.

1662
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,800
All right, well, you do that.

1663
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,160
What else did you want to say, DMN, while he's checking?

1664
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:35,480
Now hearing about that whole Wii region lock, it could be very possible that sometime down

1665
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:41,800
the road, Nintendo could release a firmware update to eliminate that issue.

1666
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,240
Why would they do that?

1667
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,360
I don't know.

1668
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,360
Perhaps maybe Nintendo will realize the error of their way sometime down the road and be

1669
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,240
like, oh, hey, these people want to play our Japanese titles.

1670
01:25:52,240 --> 01:26:01,120
They can't ignore the fact that Owen Don was one of the most imported games of 2006.

1671
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,240
And they said, okay, fine, we're going to give you Elite Beat Agents.

1672
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:11,000
But if there's an Owen Don game coming out for the Wii, I want it, and I don't want to

1673
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,960
have to buy another Wii or crack my Wii open to play on my American console.

1674
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,360
I totally understand what you're saying, because it's as cool as Elite Beat Agents might be,

1675
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,540
it's not Owen Don.

1676
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:27,640
It's not the same song list, which in a music game is everything.

1677
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:31,840
And that's what Dark Tetsuya agrees in chat right there, but Elite Beat Agents is an entirely

1678
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,840
different game.

1679
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,240
Did you find the answer, Logie?

1680
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,240
Yes I did.

1681
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,240
What?

1682
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,240
$29.99.

1683
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,240
Blast.

1684
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,240
That's all right.

1685
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,520
$29 is not a bad price, really, for that many games.

1686
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,640
But I mean, they're not all shitty clones of each other, right?

1687
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,640
They're all uniquely different, pretty cool games?

1688
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:53,160
Yeah, they're all uniquely different, and I've already played a couple games of Wi-Fi.

1689
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:58,720
There is nothing like a good Wi-Fi game of BS, and definitely nothing like a good Wi-Fi

1690
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,720
game of Speed.

1691
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,720
If anybody's familiar with that game.

1692
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,520
I'm totally going to be playing some of our chatters in Speed.

1693
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,180
I'll buy this game just for that.

1694
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,860
You could have just released Speed and I'd buy that.

1695
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,860
That's a great game.

1696
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:08,860
All right.

1697
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:12,840
Well, I'll be picking up the game, and we'll post on the forums and get an OLR get together

1698
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,480
on the clubhouse games at some point.

1699
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,480
All right, cool.

1700
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,480
All right.

1701
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,480
DMN, thanks so much for calling in.

1702
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,480
We appreciate it.

1703
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,480
All right.

1704
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,480
Take care.

1705
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,480
Have a wonderful week.

1706
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,480
Bye-bye.

1707
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,480
All right.

1708
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,480
That's going to do it for the Skyline tonight.

1709
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,480
Thank you guys so much for calling in.

1710
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,480
Sorry to those folks who didn't get through.

1711
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,480
Try again next time.

1712
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,480
Any last minute stories you want to share, Loki?

1713
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,480
Of course I do.

1714
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,480
I know.

1715
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,480
You always do.

1716
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,480
Anyways.

1717
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,480
Some wonderful stuff.

1718
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,480
Okay.

1719
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,200
One thing about the Wii, since we were just talking about it.

1720
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:42,160
The Miis that you create, actually, they're going to be popping up in different things.

1721
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:46,960
For example, in games, you might see the other Miis that you've created in the audience or

1722
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,120
in the stands for certain games.

1723
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:55,120
Also, they will be possibly migrating to other Wii systems, kind of like Animal Crossing.

1724
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,120
So that's kind of neat.

1725
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,120
Oh, that's kind of neat.

1726
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,120
Yeah.

1727
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,040
So it's not just your face in Wii Sports.

1728
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,240
It's the tennis wielder.

1729
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,240
You might start infecting other consoles.

1730
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,240
That's kind of neat.

1731
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,240
Exactly.

1732
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,240
All right.

1733
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,240
I like that.

1734
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,240
So that's pretty cool.

1735
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,240
Some other cool stuff.

1736
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:15,680
Rainbow Six Vegas is going to be seeing a demo on Xbox Live on October 23rd.

1737
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:16,960
That game looked pretty amazing.

1738
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,600
So worth checking out.

1739
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,560
As we mentioned before with GT, that it was going to have a steering wheel attachment

1740
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,680
for the Wii.

1741
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:30,760
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, another Ubisoft racing game, will also have that same steering

1742
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,360
wheel attachment as well for the Wii.

1743
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,400
So that's going to be pretty cool.

1744
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,640
Something that I thought was kind of interesting, well, actually, a few acquisitions took place

1745
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,640
this week.

1746
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:48,080
EA finished their deal to buy DICE, the makers of Battlefield franchise.

1747
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,520
So that was pretty interesting.

1748
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,600
And also, Foundation 9 acquired Shiny Entertainment.

1749
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:59,140
You might remember them from wonderful games like Earthworm Jim.

1750
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:04,560
And then there was a survey that went out for Guitar Hero that mentioned two games that

1751
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,080
are possibly in the works, Keyboard Hero and Drummer Hero.

1752
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:13,920
In no way, I'm sure, ripping off any Konami franchises with those.

1753
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,800
But interesting nonetheless.

1754
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,640
Oh yeah, I heard about that survey that went out.

1755
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,280
I don't know, though.

1756
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,920
I think people might be reading too much into that whole thing.

1757
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:32,240
There was also a really cool product that was released called Connect360 that indexes

1758
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:37,880
your iTunes and iPhoto libraries to stream them to the 360, which is interesting.

1759
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:46,760
If you want to check that out, it's www.nullriver.com slash index slash products slash Connect360.

1760
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,680
So go check that out.

1761
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:53,480
And then some more adult content that is available out there.

1762
01:29:53,480 --> 01:30:00,080
For Dead or Alive Extreme 2, you will be getting changing sequences.

1763
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,080
That's right, the girls will change.

1764
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:05,280
Like in Final Fantasy X-2, where they did the little woo!

1765
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,280
Actually yes.

1766
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,680
I knew it.

1767
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,680
It's not like...

1768
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:14,840
It says it will be anime-inspired, resembling a transformation sequence you'd find in something

1769
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,120
like Sailor Moon.

1770
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:20,520
Of course, there's going to be some really naughty stuff in there.

1771
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:28,200
And then finally, to all-out actual porno, the Whores of Warcraft, a website that's actually

1772
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:35,720
released that has Warcraft-themed porn on it, and that's Whores of Warcraft dot com.

1773
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:43,360
They have one episode you can purchase right now for $7.95, and it's real people.

1774
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,480
This isn't Maki-Mai or anything like that, but they actually also have a MySpace community

1775
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:52,080
if you want to join that, which is MySpace dot com slash Whores of Warcraft.

1776
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,560
I should also mention that Orange Lounge Radio has a MySpace community that's more worth

1777
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,560
your time.

1778
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,560
MySpace dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1779
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,360
But they have some chick that looks like she has elf ears, so that's kind of interesting.

1780
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:06,800
That's your elf porn going on there.

1781
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:14,520
I have received a hot tip from a trusted source that WarioWare for the Wii is going to be

1782
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:18,240
bumped up to a launch title, and you will be seeing that very soon.

1783
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,800
Well good, because I have that pre-ordered, and it was only slated for January.

1784
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:29,120
Well, it looks like you may actually get your WarioWare on in November, so take that as

1785
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,120
you will.

1786
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:35,600
I want to see Wii Play come out as the launch title, too.

1787
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,880
That's not even slated to come out in this country at all, is it?

1788
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,800
It's coming out in the UK, I mean, come on!

1789
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:45,640
How hard would it be to release it here as well, I mean, seriously.

1790
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,320
That's going to wrap it up for tonight's show.

1791
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:48,320
We're done.

1792
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,520
We're out of here.

1793
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,080
This is a weird show with just two of us, but we did pretty good getting through all

1794
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,080
the news.

1795
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,560
Dark Soccer will be back next week to keep us in line and to read the emails and give

1796
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:02,360
you her website of the week, of which there is none this week because she's not here.

1797
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:06,800
Next week as well, we'll have more of you guys in our chat room and on the Skype line

1798
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,040
and more news and hopefully some interviews.

1799
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,320
We are trying to get some interviews lined up for the rest of the month on through the

1800
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,320
year.

1801
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:16,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.

1802
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
We appreciate it.

1803
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1804
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,400
Well, Loki, your final thought?

1805
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:25,760
My final thought is I have two episodes of my new show done already, both an hour long.

1806
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,760
Excellent.

1807
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,760
Yes.

1808
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,000
Orange House Radio will be participating in November sweeps this year.

1809
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,480
That's all I can say.

1810
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:38,280
My final thought will be, on behalf of Jamie not being here, I will say reject false icons.

1811
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:42,960
My other final thought would be how in the hell did six bottles of Aquafina end up over

1812
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,960
on Extra First's desk?

1813
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,160
That's kind of scary.

1814
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,160
They're all half empty.

1815
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,720
Actually, quite a bit of them are mostly full.

1816
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,720
What the hell?

1817
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,720
What the hell is wrong with this picture?

1818
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:51,720
Such a waster.

1819
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,840
Oyster of water.

1820
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,760
All those countries out there that are dehydrated.

1821
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,400
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us.

1822
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,400
We appreciate it.

1823
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,400
Have a great week.

1824
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,400
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1825
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,400
