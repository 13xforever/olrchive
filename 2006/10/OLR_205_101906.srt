00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,480
Tonight, October 22nd, 2006, new firmware is on deck to the PSP, a Nintendo DS game

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,760
releases with a major bug still in the game, and is EA watching your every move?

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,840
video game podcast dedicated to gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, and what you, the

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,280
gamer, really want to know. Welcome to our show. We're pre-taping this week. We're a

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,760
little early. It is Wednesday night, October 18th, but this will be our week

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,600
show. That's because I'm traveling this week, and so is one of our lovely co-hosts

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,440
here, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Are you saying that Loki is lovely? I suppose. In

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,040
his own manly way. And I'm moving. Yeah, that's right, you're moving this weekend.

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,140
So everybody's busy this weekend, so it's just a bad weekend for us. I'm going to see

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,320
see, uh, boy love. Oh, YowieCon? Going to YowieCon, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,600
And? Gonna see Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D! But see, by the time most people

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,640
hear this, that will have all already happened, because this this is still

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
going to air usually on Sundays.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,040
We do have a small audience in our chat, a lot of our loyal listeners tonight here on

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Wednesday night.

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,440
I just wanted to kind of lay that down up front just in case there was some developing

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,260
news, some of these stories changed throughout the week.

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,000
Keep your time frame in mind that we're doing this on Wednesday, so don't blame us if something

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
changed.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
Don't blame us collectively, but you can blame Rob personally.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
Sure, why not?

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,880
All right, so anyway, let's start it off.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,360
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,040
I had a gaming week.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,080
My gaming week consisted of me being half asleep watching Dan play that crappy Mortal

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,640
Kombat game, going, oh my God, I hate the sound effects of this game, go to sleep.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,200
That's what we talked about last week.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,760
I know, but that wasn't, since my gaming week has been three days.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,040
No, no, I know, but I'm curious, I thought it was okay, why did you think it was crappy?

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,720
I hate the music in it and I hate the sound effects.

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,720
And just watching him do the same crap over and over.

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:35,760
If I want to play a good beat-em-up, I could do that Tekken fighting mode from Tekken 3.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,680
I actually haven't played Phantasy Star Universe yet, either, because I've been doing real

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
life things.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Well, you're in luck.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,520
I heard the beta was extended, which, again, we'll do the Sunday listeners no good because

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,800
it's extended through Saturday, but that's what I'm hearing.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
It doesn't mean no good.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Well, unless I want to play tonight.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
I think you can play some tonight.

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm actually gaming gaming tomorrow.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Like old-school D&D.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Like, no.

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Roll D20.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Werewolf.

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Oh, God, you nerd.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
I game every other week.

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,800
Yes, everybody, not only am I a video gaming girl, I do tabletop gaming, too.

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,080
Which just, you know, further cement you as a hardcore nerd.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,080
I know what a D4 is used for in second edition D&D, bitches.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Nerd patrol.

54
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Nerd patrol.

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
You can use it for a whip.

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Nerd herd.

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Nerd herd.

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Loki, how you doing?

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
How was your gaming week?

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
It was short, I guess.

61
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,640
Well, I played Grand Theft Auto.

62
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,600
I didn't get to play any of the PlayStation 2 games that I have lined up to play.

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,120
I don't get to play a lot of games right now because I'm packing, and packing sucks.

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,280
But I am looking forward to playing The Warriors, which, you know, is coming out on the PSV

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
pretty soon.

66
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,800
Well, probably next year.

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Yes, it was a movie, and it was an awesome PlayStation 2 game, too.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,240
So yeah, lots of Grand Theft Auto, and I'm kicking ass in that.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,200
And Zuma a little bit.

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm on level 9 now.

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,240
I beat level 8 while Nellie was asleep because she couldn't get past it, and she was getting

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
frustrated.

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,640
But she says, you know, she has to beat it herself before or else it doesn't count.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I don't know.

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,800
So whatever.

76
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,040
And then I played a little Dig Dug, and I was trying to play some Luminous Live, but

77
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,640
it won't download for me because it stops at 1%.

78
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,400
Xbox has been having some wacky stuff today ever since their maintenance yesterday.

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
And what did their maintenance do?

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
It's just stuff for their website, from what I hear.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,140
Well, we don't really know the full scope of things yet, so possibly they've done some

82
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,080
type of upgrade that's dormant until later.

83
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,620
They broke Luminous Live.

84
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,960
That's what their update was for.

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
I don't know.

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,480
Oh, and of course Saints Row.

87
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Been playing lots of Saints Row, and that's fun.

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm trying for the million dollar achievement right now, and once I get that then I'll kind

89
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
of move on.

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah, that's pretty much it for now.

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
Some comments from our chat room.

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,680
We do have a small crowd there tonight, a little smaller than our usual Sunday show,

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,440
but we say thank you to the loyalists who are there as always.

94
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,640
Jeremy Todd 1 in response to Dark Soccer being a hardcore nerd says, Tabletop gaming is for

95
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,960
people who aren't hardcore enough to play video games.

96
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I did both.

97
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
That means I'm double hardcore.

98
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,880
SSJ100 Matt says, Jesus saves and rolls D20s.

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Get it?

100
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
That's a roleplaying joke.

101
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,080
Did Jesus make a saving throw?

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,720
Let's see, My Gaming Week.

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,860
I've been playing more of the Phantasy Star universe beta.

104
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,080
I will say this, those of you guys that got frustrated with connection issues and things

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
of that sort and getting started, may not have given the game enough opportunity because

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,920
I'll tell you what, when I got in a party with some of my real life friends and we were

107
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,040
able to do voice chat, the game got like 5,000 times better.

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm looking forward to the commercial release.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,760
I'm definitely going to pick up the commercial release.

110
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm still going to hold off on a full review of the game until I actually have a commercial

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,400
release in my hands to review, but we will talk more about Phantasy Star universe at

112
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,960
a later date.

113
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,560
Meanwhile, I downloaded Luminous Life today.

114
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,280
I was able to grab it this morning, I guess maybe before the masses were getting home

115
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,240
from work, school, and started downloading on Luminous Life, so I picked that up.

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,840
I want to warn you about something with Luminous Life.

117
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,200
The game's got microtransactions at the butt, and when I say that, I mean when you download

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,120
the game, you can play Xbox Live, you can play normal challenge mode with about, I want

119
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,640
to say it's about 12 skins, forgive me if I'm a little off on that number, but if you

120
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,120
want to buy more skins, like you want to get a pack of 20 skins, you're going to have to

121
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,280
buy those later in what's called an advanced pack.

122
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,680
Also, if you go in to play versus CPU, you only get one skin, and once you play that

123
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,760
for about 10 levels, it says, thanks for trying this, buy the versus CPU pack if you want

124
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,920
more.

125
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,480
Then in mission mode, you get about five missions, hey, if you want more missions, buy the mission

126
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
pack.

127
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Yeah, what the hell's the demo?

128
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
I mean, seriously, if this is the actual game, then what's the demo?

129
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,520
I guess it's one stage of the game, so pretty much the game you're getting on Xbox Live

130
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,320
is just the skeleton game of the non-stop puzzle mode with about 12 different skins,

131
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,200
and the ability to play on Xbox Live.

132
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,880
Oh goody, but I guess they'll have 700 songs on Xbox Live at some point for a micro-transaction

133
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:27,080
of $100 each, then maybe I'll get the, I can have this go with my Gran Turismo HD.

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,000
It's hard for me to sit here and be critical of Gran Turismo HD for the micro-transaction

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
things they've been talking about, and not apply the same logic to Luminous.

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,180
I don't think that would be okay for me to do.

137
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,620
As much as I love Luminous, and I think it's an awesome puzzle game, I don't think it's

138
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,880
fair for folks to be picking up Luminous when they don't really know what they're really

139
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
buying.

140
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,640
I don't think Q Entertainment and Microsoft have been very upfront about what exactly

141
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,840
you're getting with this, and the fact that some components of the game are missing.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
Are you getting a full game?

143
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Yes.

144
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,200
Are you getting the same thing as you got on the PSP?

145
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
No.

146
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,280
The PSP version as it stands right now offers more than the basic skeleton that Xbox Live

147
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,560
is giving you.

148
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,760
I don't feel like I can give this game a fair assessment until I know it's real price for

149
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
everything else.

150
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,280
Would it have been a little bit different if the game were like $5 instead of $15 out

151
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
the gate?

152
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,920
Maybe, but again, I would take all that into consideration with how much is each little

153
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,080
component price.

154
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,920
For example, Test Drive Unlimited was kind of using that formula, basically putting out

155
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,080
a very cheap game and then having microtransactions, but the difference between Test Drive Unlimited

156
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,960
and say Gran Turismo HD or Luminous is you don't need to purchase those.

157
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,400
Granted, I bought this game because, well, I'm a cheapen point horror and it sounded

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,480
pretty easy, so hey, what the hell?

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,440
So what if I play a few stages?

160
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,400
I don't like the fact that there is only five stages because I think there should be at

161
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,400
least more, and then say later on you want to buy more songs on top of a full game's

162
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,040
worth of songs.

163
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
That's fine.

164
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, by the way, you want to progress later on, you're going to have to buy the levels.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,200
I can understand the logic that, hey, maybe not everyone wants to play Mission Mode.

166
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Hey, maybe not everyone wants to play Puzzle Mode.

167
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,840
Okay, but still you have to take the value of what you're paying out in consideration

168
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,600
with all this is that for right now, for a pretty competitive $29.99, you can get the

169
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
PSP version of Luminous, which offers more skins.

170
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,120
As it stands right now, better songs, as far as I'm concerned, even though, yes, some of

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,440
the songs in Xbox Live's version are from Luminous 1, some of the best songs on Luminous

172
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,640
1 are nowhere to be seen so far in Xbox Live Luminous, and when you put those values side

173
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,280
by side, how worth it is it to be playing Luminous on your TV?

174
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
I don't know.

175
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,400
Or if you have a PlayStation 2.

176
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Or on Xbox Live.

177
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,240
If you have a PlayStation 2, just wait and pick up Luminous Plus for $30 when that comes

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
out, which is basically just a rehash of Luminous.

179
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,760
By the way, the Madonna song, any licenses whatsoever, nowhere to be seen yet.

180
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,320
I don't know if they're going to be in the Advance pack.

181
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,800
Rumor has it they're not.

182
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,480
I have someone who's had a peek at the Advance pack and tells me that there's just more general

183
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,880
Q Entertainment produced songs in there from the first and probably second games.

184
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Nice bait and switch there, Q Entertainment.

185
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,320
So I don't know where Madonna is or any licensed artists for that matter.

186
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
That could change.

187
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,640
I'm assuming that's on Rumor there, but I'm assuming that will be another buy later on

188
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
if you want to have Madonna or what have you in your game.

189
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
So, interesting.

190
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,240
Yeah, well, I remember reading, I know, and I've got to pull this up because I pulled

191
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,520
up a different article, same type of thing, but they were talking about other additional

192
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,400
downloads beyond the Advance pack, and I want to say it was run on 1UP, but I can't remember

193
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,320
what they were showing, oh, here we go.

194
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,120
I know they had a ton of micropayment stuff, and of course they were talking about the

195
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,600
Advance pack, but they were talking about other things that you can download as well.

196
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,160
Let's see here, it says, oh, they were just talking about, I guess, the mission and puzzle

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
mode.

198
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,240
They're assuming that each one's going to be about the same price, so like $6 each or

199
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,640
whatever, or 600 points each for another 12, 100 points, or $15.

200
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,440
It says that adds up to about $22.49, and it says all of a sudden the game, after you

201
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,840
bought everything, ends up costing you $37.49.

202
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
So I don't know.

203
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,720
I have a hard time being able to say I recommend Luminous Live or I don't because I feel like

204
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,280
the whole game has not yet been revealed, so it really depends.

205
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,200
Ask yourself this question before you buy it, A, if you don't own a PSP, I do think

206
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
it's worth it.

207
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,160
I don't think it's one of the greatest puzzlers ever made, even if the music is not as good

208
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
as the PSP version.

209
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,960
I wouldn't go tell you to buy a PSP just for Luminous, so I would say it's worth checking

210
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:01,120
out if you don't have a PSP, but if you do have a PSP, yeah, so.

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,680
Anyway, let's get into some housekeeping real quick for tonight.

212
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
Tonight's housekeeping, first off, it's only going to be a one-part show tonight because

213
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,840
of the fact that we are pre-taping and usually those only end up being one part.

214
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,400
I do want to point out we will still be doing DDR previews tonight, even though it is only

215
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,080
one part, and remember we're not live, so if you've joined our chat room on this lovely

216
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,000
Sunday evening or whenever you used to listen to us live, keep in mind that we are pre-taped

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
this week.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,480
I also do have a message from one of our lesbians, Kristen would like everyone to know, she says

219
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
hi.

220
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,960
All right, so you're hanging out with her this weekend, right?

221
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Yes, I am.

222
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,680
It's a whole cluster of people going to YowieCon.

223
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,760
We averted a crisis, but she did want me to tell all the listeners hi.

224
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
All right, sounds good.

225
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,880
All right, we're going to start to get into some gaming news tonight.

226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
We've got one more thing.

227
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Oh, yes.

228
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Oh, did you get the Battlefield?

229
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I'm so sorry.

230
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
The Battlefield contest.

231
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Who won?

232
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
We do have a winner.

233
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,320
There was lots of entries, but there could only be one.

234
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,880
There could be only one.

235
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Your mom.

236
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Drum roll, please.

237
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,640
And the winner of the Battlefield 21-42, I don't remember which year it was.

238
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,120
Get the game name right, please.

239
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,080
The Battlefield 21-42 contest is Jason Tryon from St. Petersburg, Florida.

240
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Congratulations.

241
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Congratulations.

242
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,240
You'll be getting an email with your download code to download the full game with maybe

243
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,680
a few additional extras that we will be talking about a little bit later.

244
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Yay.

245
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Congratulations.

246
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,280
Wait, do I have my sound effect loaded here?

247
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Hold on.

248
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
There we go.

249
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,320
Congratulations to you from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

250
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,800
We actually have breaking news tonight.

251
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,600
I'm going to interrupt our usual show role here because here at Orange Lounge Radio we

252
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
try to plan our stories in advance.

253
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,040
We literally got breaking news about 15 minutes before we went live tonight, and for long

254
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,160
time fans of Orange Lounge Radio who listened to us back in our music gaming days, we know

255
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,440
a lot of you folks are still with us.

256
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
This is huge news.

257
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,320
Directly from OrangeLoungeRadio.com, there's a press release today on Roxor's website and

258
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,360
it was short and simple.

259
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,600
Konami Corporation, developer of the Dance Dance Revolution video game, and Roxor Games

260
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Inc., developer of the In the Groove dance games, today announced the mutual settlement

261
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,740
of the litigation between the parties in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District

262
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,960
of Texas.

263
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,100
Under the terms of the settlement, Konami has acquired the intellectual property rights

264
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,840
to the In the Groove dance game franchise.

265
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,480
It was further agreed as a part of the settlement that Roxor would respect Konami's intellectual

266
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,520
property rights.

267
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Translation?

268
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Pwned.

269
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,400
Yeah, so In the Groove dance game fans, not going to be too happy at this news.

270
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm going to be honest, I'm hearing a lot of talk already about, oh, this opens the

271
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,840
door for Konami to make DDR versus In the Groove and all this other stuff.

272
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,200
Honestly guys, I think what Konami is going to do with this license, this newly acquired

273
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,840
license so to speak, absolutely nothing.

274
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,240
I think they've got their biggest competitor so to speak and they'll just crush it like

275
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
a grape.

276
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,960
It would be a DDR PC too.

277
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,920
Now granted, there may be more information forthcoming later, who knows?

278
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,760
Perhaps Konami will re-explore the PC market with the In the Groove franchise, who knows?

279
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,200
I mean, I'm not going to say for sure I'm the end-all, be-all, know-all of what's going

280
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,280
on but in my mind, that kind of makes the most sense for Konami.

281
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,680
Why dilute the market with more dance games, just make it all DDR?

282
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,760
Well, so they would put out that patch though for In the Groove if they didn't know that

283
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,600
they were going to be losing.

284
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,940
Exactly, and this is another good point that last week there was a patch release for the

285
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,320
arcade game that allows you to play any song you want in the arcade game if you know how

286
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,600
to load it on your USB memory card.

287
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:51,680
So I do believe now that was the final F-you from Rockstar getting the last cut in before

288
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
they went down.

289
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
I think they knew that was happening.

290
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
And now you have this nice relic on your wall.

291
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
I do.

292
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,600
We have a signed In the Groove poster, In the Groove 2 poster from last year's Digital

293
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Life.

294
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm looking for millions on eBay next week.

295
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Yeah, right.

296
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
I'm kidding.

297
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Millions of pennies.

298
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,680
Here's a little something else though for those arcade owners out there with an In the

299
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,080
Groove machine with this update on it.

300
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:21,320
If the RIA catches you playing a song that's not licensed, you can be sued for a lot of

301
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
money.

302
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,400
So keep that in mind with this wonderful unlocked machine if you want to.

303
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,720
I mean, you can get sued, so there you go.

304
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,960
What if the arcade has a jukebox license?

305
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,400
If they do, but not many do.

306
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,240
So most of them think, okay, I'm safe because the game's music is licensed.

307
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,200
That doesn't include stuff that people load on there.

308
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,360
Well, more to come on this as it develops here at Orange Lounge Radio.

309
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,440
We would like to open an invitation.

310
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,560
We know there are folks in the music game industry who listen to this program.

311
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,940
If anyone from Rocks or Games would like to come on the show, present their side of things,

312
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,200
the door is open.

313
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,160
If anyone from Konami would like to come on the show and talk about the future of In the

314
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,200
Groove now that they've got it, the door is open.

315
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,720
You can go to the contact us on our website.

316
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,960
We'd love to have you on the program.

317
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,440
That is awesome now that I have the In the Groove 2 beta for PlayStation 2 because that'll

318
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,240
never be released now.

319
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Probably not.

320
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,880
Never say never, but probably not.

321
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,480
All right, back to the normal list of topics.

322
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,400
Anyways, speaking of stuff that we think will never be released, and that would be a working

323
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,280
firmware for the PSP, but the next big firmware update, 3.0, is coming and supposedly coming

324
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,200
tomorrow, or the 19th for most people out there.

325
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Anyways, what does that mean to you?

326
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,960
Well, if this is the big old firmware story that we've been waiting for, it's going to

327
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,600
have the PlayStation emulation in there, as well as support for linking up to the PlayStation

328
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,000
3 for remote play, whatever the hell that is supposed to be, but I guess we'll find

329
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,640
out when the PlayStation 3 comes out, and it's not a big surprise that that is coming

330
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,440
out tomorrow, seeing as Sony is having their gamer's day for basically covering all the

331
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,760
PlayStation 3 stuff and PSP stuff, you know, on Thursday, so that's pretty cool.

332
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,360
And yeah, so lots of good, lots of big stuff, and I'm sure a lot more ways to stop you from

333
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,240
running homebrew software, so enjoy.

334
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,840
I'm sure this will be on the next Grand Theft Auto anyway, so it'll have to update no matter

335
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
what.

336
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,040
All right, well, something that's kind of interesting in the Sony area, now this isn't

337
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,320
really officially supported by Sony, but you know, we've been talking about, you know,

338
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,920
high definition, high definition is like the next gen of gaming, well, did you know that

339
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,360
you could do high definition with your PlayStation 2?

340
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,760
Yes, that's right, there is a boot disk that's out there, and it's from, let's see, it's

341
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,600
called the Exploder HDTV Player, and it's by a company called Silicon Era, or at least

342
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
that's the, I'm sorry, no, that's the website that originally ran the story.

343
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,280
It's actually Exploder, I think, is the company.

344
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,340
Exploder is the company.

345
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,340
It says here that what you can do is that if you have a 1080i supporting TV, you can

346
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,200
load this tool before starting the game, and then what you can do is inside the menus,

347
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,960
you can select which resolution you want to run the game at, and that this Exploder program

348
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,840
is going to automatically, I suppose, upcode your, you know, existing PlayStation 2 resolution

349
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,460
to 1080i.

350
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,480
No idea exactly how successful that's going to turn out, but if they're putting this product

351
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,920
out there, they must feel pretty confident.

352
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,000
You know what that strangely reminds me of, though?

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Blamecast.

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,520
Kind of, but this isn't for a specific game.

355
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,240
Well, no, I understand that, but they were wanting to do something very similar to use

356
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,840
the better graphics processing of the Dreamcast to play other PlayStation games, too.

357
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,900
I think it's sort of along the same lines.

358
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,440
So I still don't know if this is something I would pick up, though.

359
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,180
It just seems a little too risky to me, and I don't know if the PlayStation 2 game was

360
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,800
not designed for high def.

361
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,680
It's going to be kind of funky in this transition, so I don't know if that's something I want.

362
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Why?

363
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
The PlayStation 3 is doing the same thing.

364
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Oh, okay.

365
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Why not?

366
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
All right.

367
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
So, I mean, it could happen.

368
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I mean, who knows?

369
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Stranger things, I guess.

370
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
All right.

371
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:25,120
Well, since you brought up the PS3, there actually is a little bit more news about the

372
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,420
Blu-ray discs and the developers that are working on them, that they're actually close

373
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,720
to the 25 gigabyte limit for a lot of the games.

374
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,320
And there's a lot of talk that we're putting movies in there, non-interactive content,

375
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:51,200
and we pretty much have an admission on that from one of the folks with Sony.

376
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Actually the one to speak with was Phil Harrison, who was the world studio guy.

377
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,080
But basically what he said, and this is a quote, is, I see nothing wrong with having

378
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,220
non-interactive full HD sequences as part of a game.

379
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,840
That's all part of the production value and experience you get when you buy the game.

380
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,960
I don't see that as a weakness at all.

381
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,200
It's a weakness if it's going to cut down on game time and playability.

382
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,600
I think it's a lot of the stuff is, because they are outporting the 1080p, a lot of it's

383
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:33,360
just higher res textures, or in the case you've got your high def video and stuff in there,

384
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,040
which some of that's fine.

385
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,960
And also they could be doing less compression on it because the Blu-ray drives are slower.

386
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,800
Because they are slower, well actually you would think they would do more compression

387
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,680
if they had slower Blu-ray drives, whatever.

388
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm no developer, so what the hell do I know about content?

389
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,520
All I know is 25 gigs is a lot for a game, and it better damn looked good for 25 gigs.

390
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
That's all I got to say.

391
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Wait until they have to deal with the 50.

392
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,160
What are we going to see then?

393
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
More movies?

394
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Defective discs.

395
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,800
Hopefully a Playstation 3 that will take out my trash and do my dishes.

396
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Then I buy it.

397
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
At launch.

398
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,800
New for PS3, Turbo Tax!

399
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,480
Anyways, some really cool stuff coming to the Playstation 3, and this is also coming

400
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,600
out of Sony's Gamer Day.

401
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,360
First off, their brand new e-distribution titles, or their Sony arcade, whatever the

402
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,160
hell you want to call it.

403
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,600
Some pretty cool stuff actually.

404
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,840
Very interesting ones, like for example, there's a new game that kind of resembles Geometry

405
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,240
Wars, which is kind of neat, called Blast Factor.

406
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,560
There's going to be Lemmings 2, which apparently is not a port of the original Lemmings 2,

407
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,360
but is a brand new Lemmings game, you know, updated graphics and whatnot.

408
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,520
Go Sudoku, because, god, there's just not enough Sudoku out there.

409
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,000
Swizzle Blocks, which I don't know what that is, but it sounds like a puzzle game.

410
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Criminal Crackdown, and, well, Flow, because that was previously announced.

411
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,960
I saw some of the screenshots for some of these games, looked interesting.

412
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,480
I, Blast Factor looked pretty cool, and the graphics looked pretty pristine on it, so

413
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,880
I don't know if it's just a TV or screenshots that they're showing, but...

414
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,620
I'm hoping out of this Gamer's Day thing that will have already happened by the time most

415
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,720
of you hear this, we will see a little more, like, in the means of footage, and kind of

416
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,200
made, like, not so much screenshots, but actual footage, kind of what they look like in action.

417
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,600
You know what I wish they had is like a console that's just these mini-games, because that

418
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
would be pretty cool.

419
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Well, what about one of those crappy plug-and-play joystick things?

420
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,000
No, I'm talking about, like, an online service or something where you can download, I mean,

421
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,040
I hate these, all these arcade things and stuff.

422
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,720
Isn't that what Phantom wanted to be?

423
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Yeah, but the Phantom was lame.

424
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
So wait, so you're...

425
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
No, Phantom wanted to do full games.

426
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,280
Did you just say that you want the Phantom to come out?

427
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,840
I did not say I wanted the Phantom to come out.

428
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,360
Are you gonna run over to GameStop and reserve your Phantom?

429
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,440
The Phantom is just a really crappy PC.

430
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,080
Now, granted, the case looked pretty, pretty lame, but actually the case reminded me of

431
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,640
something that would be in, like, Half-Life 2 or something, and I liked the glowing light

432
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
on the front.

433
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,720
But that's all I liked about the Phantom, and I wouldn't touch that fucking lap board

434
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
with the 10-foot pole.

435
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,840
All right, well, for those that were worried that they may not get a hand on the PlayStation

436
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,680
3 this year, you should probably still be a little bit worried, but it is said that

437
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:39,560
they are on target to produce 1 million PlayStation 3s in 2006.

438
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,600
Sony has confirmed they are aiming for 1 million PlayStation 3s in North America by the end

439
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,760
of this year.

440
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,040
For day one, we're gonna have a total of 400,000 units for the launch period only for

441
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,120
North America, and we expect to have about 1 million units by the end of the calendar

442
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
year.

443
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,720
These are some pretty aggressive numbers, and that comes from Kazurai himself.

444
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,660
So those that were thinking that PlayStation 3 was gonna get delayed a little further in

445
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,160
the U.S., such as something I actually speculated previously on the show, I was wrong.

446
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,440
Yes, and I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is still launching spring of 2006, like they previously

447
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
said.

448
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,640
I do think the machine's gonna launch, but I think we're gonna see Xbox 360 shortages

449
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,160
all over again.

450
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,140
I'm not too disappointed.

451
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,560
I don't really need one at launch this time next year.

452
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,760
Yeah, I'll probably have one.

453
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,000
Honestly, the only reason I feel like I should own one of these at launch is because of the

454
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
show.

455
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,920
But I'll also go to Jamie's house and play hers.

456
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,840
We can see if that 1080p is worth a damn, since my TV will run it.

457
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Yep.

458
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,120
You know what, though?

459
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,680
I think I'm still just gonna use it as a paperweight.

460
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,840
Well, we'll see.

461
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
We'll see.

462
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,400
Well, speaking of things to see, I do have a list of release dates for our buddies in

463
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,200
the U.K.

464
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,080
On the 26th is Anos 1701 for PC.

465
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,640
A bunch of other stuff on the 27th, and I'm not going to list all the systems they're

466
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,040
on because there's a few multiple releases, but there's Action Loop, Blade Dancer, Lineage

467
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,160
of Light, Dark Messiah, Might and Magic, Dragon Ball Z, Tenkaichi Budokai 2, Dragon Warriors

468
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Volume 2, FIFA 07, Ford Street Racing, LA Duel, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, Metal

469
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,160
Slug, Metal Slug Anthology, Myst Ultimate Compilation, NBA 2K7, blah, blah, blah, Neo

470
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:29,640
Geo Battle Colosseum, Pipa Funnel, Pipa Funnel 2 on GBA, by the way, Pipa Funnel, Take the

471
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:37,320
Reigns, Prince of Persia Trilogy, Pro Evolution Soccer 6, Sudoku Master, Sims 2 Pets, Tiger

472
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,880
Woods PGA Tour 2007, Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Double Agent, Warhammer 40K, War of Dawn,

473
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,400
Dark Crusade, if you want to play Warhammer, just go buy the figures, Zoo Tycoon 2, Marine

474
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,640
Mania, and on the 31st Legend of Spyro, A New Beginning, although I'd just rather go

475
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,160
trick or treating.

476
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,640
Spyro's not that bad.

477
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,440
Spyro is an in-joke on Spyro's message board that I moderate on.

478
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm going to be seeing Whoop 11 on that day, so screw Spyro.

479
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Anywho...

480
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Nerd!

481
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I know!

482
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,800
Did you get any more nerdier tonight?

483
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm going to go see a Trekkie band.

484
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,440
Are you wearing a pocket protector?

485
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
No.

486
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Anywho...

487
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,880
I do have a chainmail bra.

488
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,560
La la la la la.

489
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,040
So there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week.

490
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,640
We've actually got some pretty cool stuff like, for example, Marvel Ultimate Alliance

491
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,000
will be coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, and the 360, and I believe the PSP as well.

492
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,200
Some other fun games, Reservoir Dogs, the ultra-violent game, will be on Playstation

493
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,840
2 and Xbox.

494
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,120
We've got Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, and GameCube.

495
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,840
Nicktoons Battle for Volcano Island on Playstation 2, GameCube DS, and Game Boy Advance.

496
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:01,200
And of course, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam will be coming out on the DS and Game Boy Advance,

497
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
so that should be pretty neat.

498
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,000
And of course for you RPG fans, we've got Phantasy Star Universe coming out on Playstation

499
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,620
2, PC, and on the 360.

500
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,720
And other fun stuff, well these are a little bit way off now, and even more way off than

501
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,920
we mentioned last week.

502
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,280
I unfortunately have to give you guys the bad news that DDR Universe has been delayed

503
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,760
into March of 2007.

504
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,480
How do you know this?

505
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
From my work.

506
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Alright.

507
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
It's from Konami themselves.

508
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Alright.

509
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,320
So, you know, I'm not surprised because all their other games...

510
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,040
Could they change it back?

511
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,240
It could very well change back.

512
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,200
I don't think it will change back, because that's a pretty large jump there, so yeah.

513
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,920
I would say March, because it makes sense, I mean it's just like Beatmania last year,

514
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,120
so no big deal.

515
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,040
There have been some price drops on some 360 games in case you're interested.

516
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,120
You know what though, I want to say real quick, for folks that were very critical of DDR Universe's

517
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,400
build at E3, that could actually be good news that they went back and retooled some things.

518
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,600
Because you know a lot of people were bitching about the interface on Universe and things

519
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
like that.

520
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,920
Remember when people complained about UltraMix 2, they went back and retooled it, and that

521
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,960
came out, in my mind, still the best DDR home release they've done yet.

522
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,480
So I'm not saying they are, I don't know, but that could be good news.

523
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,560
I'd rather them wait and get it right, you know.

524
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Let's see, well anyways...

525
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,120
Or they're putting in the groove songs in it.

526
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,640
Just kidding, no.

527
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,320
A few price drops here.

528
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,200
We have Hitman Blood Money for the 360s dropped down to $39.99.

529
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,720
Every other version for Hitman Blood Money has actually dropped $10, so that's pretty

530
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
good.

531
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,000
Tomb Raider Legends dropped down to $29.99 for the 360, and all the other versions have

532
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
dropped also $10.

533
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,400
And finally, Condemned, which wasn't that expensive to begin with, and actually was

534
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,560
$39.99 for a while now, is now $29.99.

535
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,080
So if you haven't picked it up yet, probably a good time to do it.

536
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Because it is the only Survivor Horror game, pretty much, on the 360.

537
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,880
Comments in our chatroom on Spyro.

538
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,080
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I remember I had a Spyro game for the GBA, and I got stuck on the 4th

539
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,920
or 5th world, and then I gave it away.

540
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,360
Separoth1215 says, Spyro is now voiced by Elijah Wood, I guess that's further proof

541
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
he's jumped the shark.

542
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,200
SSJ100Matt says, Spyro needs to end, it's time for him to grow up and burninate the

543
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
countryside.

544
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
There you go.

545
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Well I was going to mention also, there was a game that actually came out last week, or

546
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,920
this week depending on when you're listening to the show I guess.

547
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,120
Splinter Cell Double Agent for the 360.

548
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,060
It is going to be one of the first titles that will support the brand new fall dashboard

549
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,600
update for the 360, and it will support 1080p.

550
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
So that's pretty sweet.

551
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,920
Well we'll have to see how sexy that looks on a TV that can support it.

552
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,000
Again, we'll be going over to Jamie's house.

553
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,560
Because she has to have all the big toys, because she's a nerd.

554
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:05,320
Hey, it's not just me, it's the fact that my husband has this, oh my god I need resolution!

555
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,040
I need a TV that's bigger than god!

556
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,720
Speaking of nerds, you have to be a little bit nerdy if you're importing your games from

557
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Japan.

558
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,560
You know, I've imported a couple games from Japan, I wear that nerd badge with pride.

559
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,660
For those of you guys that are importing games from Japan, here's some games that are coming

560
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,480
out this week, or if you live in Japan, and you can just walk down the street and pick

561
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,640
up some of these games.

562
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,880
We have Nizu no Senoritsu 2, I'm sorry Senoritsu 2, which is coming out from Kid, it's an adventure

563
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,080
game, and of course it's the sequel to Nizu no Senoritsu 1, which is entering best hits

564
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,400
as well this week.

565
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,840
That all goes down on October 26th, 2006.

566
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,960
Princess Princess comes out from Marvelous Entertainment, it's also an adventure game.

567
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,720
I noticed the cover has these three anime looking chicks, who I would speculate might

568
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,640
be the princesses in this game.

569
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Although there's two princesses in that title and three on the box, so, I don't know.

570
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,880
Also coming out from D3 is Mermaid Prism, another adventure game coming out October

571
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,200
26th.

572
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,360
And lastly on my list here we have Utaware Rumono, yet another adventure game, but this

573
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,640
one coming to us from Aqua Plus.

574
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,440
Check that out this week in Japan.

575
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Sweet.

576
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,920
Is that Utaware?

577
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,140
Oh, probably.

578
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,800
Why do I do the Japanese releases?

579
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,280
I've never taken a lick of a Japanese class.

580
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
I think we need to.

581
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,480
I mean, I love our UK people, but I can trade.

582
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,520
I love them too.

583
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Let me at them.

584
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,880
I love our Japanese people too.

585
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Alright.

586
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,720
We'll talk that up behind the scenes, because you've actually had Japanese class, so I butcher

587
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
those words.

588
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
So.

589
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I was just wondering.

590
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I openly admit.

591
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I can't see through you.

592
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,520
I just did the Japanese release dates because they were lonely and needed some love.

593
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,980
No one was talking about them anywhere, so, you know.

594
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:00,360
I took them into my home and I sheltered them, even if I did horribly butcher their names.

595
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
And releasing in Antarctica?

596
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Nothing.

597
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Sorry, guys.

598
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:12,080
However, being released in nowhere is actually, speaking of things that aren't actually going

599
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:20,840
to be making it out, I should say, the major UK retailers, Currys and Dixons, are not going

600
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:29,440
to be stocking Canis Canem Edit, which, for those of us in the US, is a bully.

601
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,360
One of their spokespeople said, we have no plans to stock Canis Canem Edit.

602
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,600
We are fully aware people will be able to buy this game elsewhere, but we feel this

603
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,400
game is not appropriate for Currys' family-friendly image.

604
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Eat it.

605
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
It's Latin, right?

606
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay.

607
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,240
I don't think I take Latin.

608
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
You do the Japanese words.

609
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
I'll do the Latin words.

610
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Here we go.

611
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Whatever.

612
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,400
Orange Lounge Radio.

613
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,840
We are high school graduates.

614
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,640
Anyway, it's going to be out October 27th.

615
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,440
It has a 15 rating.

616
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
It's not that bad of a game.

617
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,800
It got really good reviews and apparently the character at the end, spoiler alert, becomes

618
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,640
an upstanding citizen who gives more than he takes.

619
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,440
And makes out with boys as well as girls.

620
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,840
Is this true?

621
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,240
I think there are certain characters that you can make out with.

622
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,520
I need to quit this game.

623
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
No thank you.

624
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
The kid's what, 15?

625
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,520
No thank you.

626
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,040
Anyways, Grand Theft Auto IV.

627
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Again, it's way off.

628
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,360
It's supposed to be coming out in October next year.

629
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Like a year from now?

630
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Yeah.

631
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
And I cannot wait.

632
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,480
But no, anyway, the PlayStation 3 is also getting exclusive episodic content.

633
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,720
Okay, listen now.

634
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,220
Rockstar, do you know what the word exclusive means?

635
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,200
It means one system, Getty, the other system, no Getty.

636
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,920
So you know what?

637
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,440
Maybe both Getty, some content, okay.

638
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,760
Anyways, so both of them will have online.

639
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,140
Don't ever read children's story time books.

640
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,080
Don't ever do that because you can't do it.

641
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,400
Shut up.

642
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
She can't speak Latin.

643
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,620
I can't speak Japanese and you can't read to children.

644
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,800
That's fine.

645
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,240
Anyways, so yeah, it's going to get episodic content, not a big surprise, and what might

646
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,880
be different is the content might be different for each platform, who knows.

647
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,400
My guess, no, because they are lazy, so it will be the same on both platforms.

648
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,560
I think you're wrong.

649
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,360
I think it's like Soul Calibur II, where you had one character on the, I'm not saying literally

650
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,520
this is it, but you know how you had Link on the GameCube and Spawn on the Xbox and

651
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,320
Heihachi on the PlayStation, and it was, you know, that was their exclusive content per

652
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
console.

653
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,220
What you're going to get in Grand Theft Auto is you're going to get like, you know, West

654
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:56,440
Island on the PlayStation and East Island on the Xbox, and the Wii gets nothing.

655
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,800
Rob, if you've ever played the multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories,

656
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
they're lazy.

657
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,160
They are not going to make new content.

658
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,280
We would be lucky if the original content works correctly.

659
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,860
If we had to wait a goddamn year for the game, I would think they have enough time to make

660
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,120
West Island and East Island.

661
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,560
West Side and East Side.

662
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Exactly.

663
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
I was waiting for that.

664
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,120
Meanwhile, who won that Battlefield thing earlier in the show?

665
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
That was Jason from Florida?

666
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Yeah.

667
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
I think that was his name.

668
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
All right.

669
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,080
Well, Jason from Florida, be careful before you install Battlefield 2142.

670
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,160
Something you might want to consider is that this letter that leaked to various gaming

671
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,440
blogs this week that basically says that there is IGA advertising technology in the game.

672
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,840
Now, the purpose of this technology is to deliver advertisements when you use the software

673
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
on the Internet.

674
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,080
It's basically going to collect anonymous information to measure what types of ads you

675
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,540
should be seeing based on, you know, where you live and things of that nature.

676
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,920
It's kind of anonymously looking at your IP or what have you.

677
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,720
And of course, everyone is going flipping nuts on forums about this, like, how dare

678
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:14,600
EA spy on me, how this is an invasion of my privacy, I was going to buy Battlefield 2142

679
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,280
but now I'm not, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

680
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
Loki had some strong opinions on this.

681
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Yeah.

682
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,000
It's retarded is what it is.

683
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,300
And the reason it's retarded is because this is retarded or the reaction, the backlash

684
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
is retarded.

685
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,520
And this is why.

686
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,380
It's for just those fucking dynamic ads that are in the game.

687
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,680
But all it looks at is your IP address to figure out where the hell in the world you

688
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
are.

689
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,360
So if you're in France, that the ads aren't in English, they're in French or they're for

690
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,160
products that come out in France, you know, stuff like that.

691
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,840
So it, you know, and also it's collecting information on how many views of said ad you

692
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,520
have made so that they can go and, you know, bill whomever, you know, their clients.

693
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,640
Our friend and pal and buddy VXChaseNXV in chat is jumping up and down screaming.

694
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,560
An IP address is not anonymous information, grr argh.

695
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Get over it, people.

696
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,440
Seriously, it's not like saying we're collecting your credit card information.

697
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,760
We're going to be watching where you're browsing on the internet.

698
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,200
It's just a goddamn IP.

699
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,040
It's just figuring out where you are in the world.

700
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,560
I don't think EA is the first company to be watching you.

701
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
No.

702
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
War of the Warcraft.

703
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,600
Every time you sign into Xbox Live, Microsoft knows what you're playing and they track it

704
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,760
on the internet for your friends to see.

705
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,200
So War of the Warcraft, you know, they, you know, monitor your computer for spyware, but

706
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,040
oh my God, they can be monitoring for other things, you know.

707
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
It's just, whatever.

708
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,160
I used somebody's IP address to track down when I was being stalked.

709
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,840
Well, yeah, I mean, you could, I don't, they might be collecting your IP address, but they're

710
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
just using that for this.

711
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
I don't think they care where your house is.

712
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,400
Yeah, I don't think they're going to come knock on your door, sir, you've been playing

713
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
too much of our game.

714
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,280
Well, they don't care that, you know, you've been looking, you know, it's, you know, porn

715
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
all the day.

716
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,520
What they should have done, I guess, what would be the common, you know, the happy medium

717
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,800
here is have you sign up on their website or whatever, putting your address information

718
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,640
in there and then you don't have to have your IP tracked because they'll go off that address

719
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,920
and send you ads based on where you live via that.

720
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,840
DMN says, but this allows for date people in insert zip code here.

721
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
That shit's annoying.

722
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,720
Microsoft doesn't hit you with shitty ads.

723
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,280
Yes, they do.

724
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,040
Download our artist video of the month on Xbox Live this week.

725
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,160
Buy a Yaris from the Xbox Live Arcade because no one else is.

726
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
Buy a Sion.

727
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:39,160
I just feel sorry for people like in my home state having to see ads for, you know, all

728
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,680
kinds of, you know, heat hauling.

729
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,000
What about the official Xbox Magazine that makes you watch stupid commercials to unlock

730
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
points in their disk to unlock a further demo, which by the way is probably already on Xbox

731
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,960
Live Marketplace anyways.

732
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,440
What I think is interesting though, let's look at the bigger picture here.

733
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,000
Loki, what do you think of this?

734
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,400
The bigger picture that people are saying is bullshit, is that I'm paying, you know,

735
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,840
60 bucks, 50 bucks, whatever for a game that has advertising in it.

736
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
That's too much money.

737
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,240
If the game has advertising in it, it shouldn't cost me that much money.

738
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,280
Does it cost you anything to play online?

739
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,320
No, it doesn't.

740
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
You know why?

741
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,480
Because that money that they're making from advertising helps run the servers.

742
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,040
I'm just surprised that someone with such a philosophy is actually kind of supporting

743
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
this in a way.

744
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
It's kind of interesting.

745
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,360
I don't see a problem with it, and to be honest, so what?

746
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,820
There's fucking ads on billboards that are in this world.

747
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:43,720
It's not like, you know, my character has a fucking, you know, date hot people or whatever

748
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,960
in this zip code strapped to his body or something.

749
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,460
It's not like they're that obtrusive.

750
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,080
They're just on fucking billboards.

751
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,100
I don't notice what the hell are on billboards in the game, and if you're sitting there staring

752
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,120
at the fucking billboard, you're probably going to get shot or stepped on by a giant

753
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
robot.

754
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,040
So, whatever.

755
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,840
If you're really going to get your panties in the bunch for that, I don't want to see

756
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,480
you playing Battlefield 2142 anyways.

757
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,840
Go play another game.

758
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,120
VX Jason says, give me the ability to run my own server and fuck your advertisements.

759
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,120
You think people are going to end up hacking this game to take the shit out?

760
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,440
Sure, why not?

761
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,120
They've done it before with other games, so I don't see why they couldn't.

762
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
All right.

763
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:30,320
Well, all this talk of privacy and invading our privacy and, you know, ruffling our feathers

764
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
here.

765
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,680
It's, you know, the internet versus EA and what have you.

766
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:41,520
It makes us a little bit angsty, so that means we have to bring on the FUs of the week.

767
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:59,960
Yes, the antibiotic that they prescribe quite often for a sinus infection, so I guess it

768
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,920
really is rooted to my sinus infection that I'm still not, you know, done with.

769
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,400
But I would like to actually be able to digest solid food, please, drugs, hurry up and be

770
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,040
done with me so that I can actually eat a pizza without wanting to die.

771
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,160
Not love me.

772
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,520
F you to my head hurting because I have a headache right now and it's one of those ones

773
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,160
that's not really that bad, but it's in the back of my skull and that sucks because there's

774
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,520
no way to get rid of it, so I fucking hate that and I get them so often.

775
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
It's from your neck?

776
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,360
It's from a tumor.

777
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,520
It's not a tumor.

778
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,400
F you to the fact that I'm getting on a red-eye flight tomorrow night to New York City and

779
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,480
I'm getting sick.

780
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,040
I can feel my body getting sick.

781
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,000
I know this because I was cold in my office all day and I usually don't get cold unless

782
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,160
I'm getting sick, so that's just great.

783
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,960
I'm getting sick to ruin my vacation in New York City.

784
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Yay!

785
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Joint excitement.

786
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
F you to viruses.

787
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,960
New York City?

788
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Sorry.

789
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Shut up.

790
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Get a rope.

791
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,720
Anyways, moving on.

792
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:15,400
Well, speaking of things that are moving at least, we've got a track listing for Elite

793
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Beat Agents, so if anybody who is interested, and actually, again, the release for that

794
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,840
is going to be November 6th over here in the US, but the songs that are going to be in

795
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:35,200
it is Walkie Talkie Man by Stereogram, ABC, Jackson 5, Skater Boy, Avril Lavigne, I Was

796
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,480
Born to Love You, Queen, Rock This Town, Stray Cats, which is a great song, Highway Star,

797
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,400
Deep Purple, YMCA, Village People, September, Earth, Wind & Fire, Canned Heat, Jamiroquai,

798
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:52,800
Material Girl, Madonna, Lala, Ashley Simpson, you're the inspiration, Chicago.

799
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,560
You know I used to actually have that on a 45.

800
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,760
Nerd.

801
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,680
No that just meant it was the 80s.

802
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:10,360
Survivor, Destiny's Child, Without a Fight, Hoobastank, Believe, Cher, that's so gay,

803
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,480
Let's Dance, David Bowie, I love David Bowie, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Rolling Stones, Makes

804
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,160
No Difference, Sum 41, The Anthem, Good Charlotte.

805
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,080
Well, this will certainly ruffle the feathers of those folks that were expecting to get

806
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,520
more Japanese style music, but if that's what you wanted, import Oh and Don.

807
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,200
I thought they were expecting to get Japanese music.

808
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,240
Exactly, so this is certainly an Americanized version, it definitely is going to take this

809
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,060
series in a completely different direction.

810
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,800
You know what, although there's a couple of songs on that list that made me go, ugh, you

811
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,140
know any music game is going to have a couple songs that made me go, ugh, so I'm okay with

812
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,140
it.

813
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,360
I think it'll actually be fun, there's some kind of funny songs on there, so it should

814
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,200
be interesting to see it in this system.

815
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm upset with this track list.

816
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Why?

817
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:02,960
Because any time that Cher song is seen anywhere with my eyes, it gets stuck in my head, and

818
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,280
I can't get it out, and I also think of that Margaret Cho act too where she was talking

819
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
about it.

820
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,600
Yay, I know what game to play every time Jamie's over.

821
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,760
You know what, I know which ass to kick every time I'm over.

822
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,880
Yes, speaking of ass kicking, Red Octane or Activision have basically kicked the ass of

823
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,000
any third party guitar controller, because according to the official PlayStation Magazine

824
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,240
demo of Guitar Hero 2, they will not work, so if that's indicative of the final game,

825
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,600
your third party controller will no worky on the brand new game, so that kind of sucks.

826
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,420
At least this is based on the demo, right?

827
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:50,240
Based on the demo, but you know what, I don't know, how hard could it be to get a controller

828
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
to work?

829
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,360
I mean seriously, so, I don't know, we'll see, I'm sure people will find a workaround

830
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,160
for that, but as of right now, that's kind of poopy, seeing as Red Octane started off

831
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,480
as a third party controller manufacturer, and now they're just kind of saying, fuck

832
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,880
you all.

833
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,680
Yeah, so let me get this straight.

834
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,520
A company that got its start as a third party peripheral manufacturer has effectively locked

835
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:24,160
out third party peripheral manufacturers from their latest games.

836
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,280
It's a preemptive strike.

837
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,040
It's cutting out future competition for other third party.

838
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,040
It's interesting.

839
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
It's an interesting tactic.

840
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
I mean that's business.

841
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,560
You can hem and haw all you want about Red Octane or bastard people, they're hypocrites,

842
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,400
blah, blah, blah, but that's just business.

843
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,760
There was basically the official controller, they way it kind of recognized it was an official

844
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,960
controller is because they had the left button shorted out, kind of like how pop-in music

845
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,000
has that.

846
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,640
They have a button shorted out to be able to detect that it's the official pop-in music

847
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,640
controller.

848
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:02,080
What's interesting though is there's some speculation that this was to lock out those

849
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,240
third party wireless controllers because Red Octane was coming out with their own wireless

850
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,560
controller for the PlayStation 2.

851
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,560
Interesting.

852
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,440
Well, if guitars aren't your thing and singing is more your style, you already know the karaoke

853
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,160
revolution American Idol is coming out on the PlayStation 2 pretty soon and Konami is

854
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:27,400
going to be launching a tour to find the first virtual American Idol.

855
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,880
And if you win this and you are the virtual American Idol, you will win airfare, accommodations

856
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,040
and tickets to a taping of the real American Idol TV show so you can look at the better

857
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,040
singers.

858
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,720
Oh boy.

859
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,720
Even if you just participate, you'll still get, what is this, a contest t-shirt and a

860
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,240
coupon for $5 off when pre-ordering through konami.com.

861
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,980
If you win in your region, you do get a free copy of the game.

862
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,820
So this is going on tour around the nation and let's see, Loki, I want you to keep November

863
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:02,840
4th clear because we're taking a trip to San Francisco to go to the Stone's Town Galleria

864
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,280
because you know you owe it to the listeners to participate in this.

865
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,280
I am not doing this.

866
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,280
Oh yes, he is, folks.

867
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,280
No, I'm not.

868
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,280
And we're going to tape the whole thing for the future of the Ontario TV project.

869
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,280
I am not doing this.

870
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Yes, you are.

871
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,280
It's fine.

872
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,280
I am not doing this.

873
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,280
I know.

874
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,280
You're going to play this little game here where you're going to say you're not going

875
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,280
to do it.

876
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,280
No, I'm not.

877
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,800
And then we're going to get him and then it's supposed to be a surprise, folks.

878
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,640
He's just being sheepish.

879
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
Don't worry.

880
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,200
We'll have him there and root for him if you're in San Francisco.

881
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,720
I am not playing that damn game.

882
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,200
Bring your Loki signs, like they have on the show, Loki is my American Idol.

883
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,320
You know who we should take to that?

884
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,720
Iguana Girl.

885
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:45,240
We should, but we'll take her to another city because I've got to have Loki win this one.

886
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,240
No.

887
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,040
Iguana Girl can go and be the real winner.

888
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,040
That's fine.

889
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,960
Oh, see, look, you're getting support from our chat.

890
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
Look at all the...

891
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,800
They're so excited that you're going to be saying, what song are you going to do when

892
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,840
you try out for Karaoke Revolution America?

893
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,040
I'm not playing that game.

894
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
I know, I know.

895
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,040
Yeah, that's right, Matt.

896
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
Keep telling yourself that.

897
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,120
I'm not driving down there either.

898
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,120
Anyways.

899
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
I'll drive.

900
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
It's fine.

901
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
No.

902
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
I won't even charge you for gas.

903
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,760
Jamie will chip in for gas.

904
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
We'll go and dutch.

905
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
With what money?

906
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
I'm poor.

907
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,760
Anyways.

908
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,760
I'll sell the ferret.

909
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,240
Oh, my baby.

910
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:25,920
If dancing is more of your thing, you'll be happy to know that the ever rumored, because

911
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:33,400
everyone wanted a DDR MMO, well, Dave Perry, who you might remember from Shiny, is creating

912
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,200
a new MMO called Dance, which is promising players will have a chance to create their

913
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,480
own unique dancers, and through variable styles, facial features, and clothing accessories,

914
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,680
you can also be able to actually play.

915
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:52,840
It sounds very similar to O2Jam or something like that, but it should be pretty interesting.

916
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,480
Obviously, when I first read the news on this, it sounds very similar to one of those popular

917
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,800
Korean music games, such as O2Jam, R2B, one of those types of games, kind of an Americanized

918
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,800
dish, you know, I wouldn't say it's an Americanized version of this, but that idea, that concept

919
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,640
in a localized MMO should be interesting.

920
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,120
I'll check it out if it's free.

921
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,640
I mean, it can't be free, right?

922
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,640
Exactly.

923
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,080
Will they be watching my IP, though, and delivering me in-game ads?

924
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,080
You betcha.

925
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:26,320
Actually, I think this was one of the ones that they were talking about supporting it

926
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,400
with ads, because it was going to be free, but it might have been another game, I don't

927
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,400
know.

928
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
All right.

929
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,600
Well, every week, you send us emails, and Dark Soccer writes down your IPs with a big

930
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,600
magic marker.

931
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,000
And then I lock them down to your zip code.

932
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,200
Sends them to the spam factory to say, no, I'm just kidding.

933
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,900
Of course, we never give out your emails, addresses, or IP.

934
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,560
We wouldn't do that to you.

935
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
We're not the man.

936
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,160
But we will read what you write to us on air.

937
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,200
Actually, I find where you live, and if your letter sucks, I leave Stinky Poo on your front

938
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
doorstep.

939
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Oh, I see.

940
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
All right.

941
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,160
Well, hopefully, we've got some letters that did not earn a poo bombing this week.

942
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,480
Dark Soccer, open up the mailbag and pull some emails out for us.

943
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:16,840
The first one comes from, well, it doesn't really have a name on it, so I'm just going

944
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,040
to say Pendragon.

945
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,600
Actually, Aibo is not useless.

946
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,280
I've had this ERS-7 since they first came out.

947
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,280
He watches my house when I'm not there, and he has his own blog on the web.

948
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Meet Falco at FusionCrew.org slash Falco.

949
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,600
That would be kind of funny.

950
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,560
I did want to get one at one point, but they're just too damn expensive.

951
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,040
I want an Eibo.

952
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,120
I'm in shock someone wrote us to tell us they have an Eibo that has a blog.

953
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,920
My Xbox 360 has a blog.

954
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,040
I want an Eibo that has a blog and that we'll be walking around because it randomly takes

955
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,040
pictures and stuff.

956
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,400
It's like, oh, look, there's people having sex on the couch or something like that and

957
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,400
posts a blog.

958
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,600
It would just get more pictures of your foot, but I'm going to start a PayPal account for

959
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
myself.

960
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,560
The donate to Dark Soccer's Eibo fund.

961
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
You do that.

962
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,080
Let's see if I get an Eibo.

963
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,080
Come on, chat room.

964
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,240
You know you want to help me get an Eibo to replace the ferret.

965
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,240
Sell your goddamn TV.

966
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,240
Then you can afford an Eibo.

967
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,080
I'll get an Eibo and I'll name him Ferret.

968
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,120
Anyway, this is when I get my wireless router working the right way again.

969
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,400
You can email Falco and he'll take a picture and email it back to you.

970
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,400
That's at ibofalco.comcast.net, so I think that's pretty funny.

971
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,680
By the way, he wants us to pick him for the drawing, but I think it's a little too late.

972
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Sorry.

973
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Maybe you should have entered your Eibo.

974
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,200
Dude, I want an Eibo.

975
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,200
I want an Eibo to win a contest.

976
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,600
We should have a world's sexiest Eibo contest.

977
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,720
I don't want one of those ones that actually look like dogs.

978
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,160
I want one of the old school Eibos.

979
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,160
You just need to...

980
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,160
They're really cool.

981
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Anyway.

982
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
This one comes from Gomez.

983
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,200
Hey, Orange Lounge.

984
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,320
This is the first time I've ever sent you guys an email because I'm kind of an Orange

985
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,800
Lounge noob because I only started listening about episode 196.

986
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,160
Nice run on sentence.

987
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,160
Welcome to the show.

988
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,560
I'm glad you've decided to stick around.

989
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,720
I love the show and the praise you give Xbox 360 LOL.

990
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,160
However, my friends and I have been having some problems with the system.

991
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,840
My controllers now have a mandatory tape job on the back of them to keep the batteries

992
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,840
connected so the controller does not disconnect due to a loss of power, which makes me really

993
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
mad.

994
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,200
But this doesn't compare to a friend of mine whose Xbox broke just recently, but Microsoft

995
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,280
was generous enough to give him a new one, which within a week was also broken.

996
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,280
He had to endure another couple of months without an Xbox, even though he had just bought

997
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
NHL07.

998
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,720
Dude, you're like the king of run on sentences.

999
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
This is awesome.

1000
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,720
NHL07?

1001
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
Boo.

1002
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,480
The system can be a hassle when it freezes on me or the controllers disconnect in the

1003
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,520
middle of a game or battle, but nothing makes me more mad than the controller disconnect

1004
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,880
and because of this my Xbox freezes.

1005
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,240
Either way, I love my Xbox 360 because of the fantastic graphics and games, and yet

1006
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,560
I hate the frustrations.

1007
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,640
I guess I hate it and love it.

1008
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:09,280
The other topic I had to say was to do with the new Phantasy Star Universe demo that came

1009
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,040
out to the marketplace recently.

1010
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,920
Since I've downloaded pretty much every demo I had to play, this one pretty much got me

1011
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,080
hooked but not before some difficulty.

1012
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,760
I originally made myself one of those robot guy characters and pretty much held the A

1013
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,480
button through the whole tutorial while talking to my friend, which I later found out was

1014
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,400
a mistake because I had never played these MMO games before.

1015
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,200
So all I could do was walk around asking people, hey, how do you battle?

1016
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,480
Or do you know how to get money?

1017
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,800
And my normal response would be, no, go away you noob, you suck at this game, screw off,

1018
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,320
and ah ha ha ha, yeah right noob.

1019
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,920
No, yeah right what a noob, which didn't help me at all because I couldn't have any fun

1020
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,480
with this demo and made my gaming experience go down the drain.

1021
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,960
However, I remembered Sky on your show mentioned something about being a girl in World of Warcraft

1022
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,320
and how he got lots of items and stuff for free, so I decided to give it a try.

1023
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,840
I made a new account and made this girl human super hot with handlebars or pigtails or whatever

1024
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,760
you guys like to call them.

1025
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,120
And once I entered the world, it was entirely, hello, how's it going, oh wow, you're really

1026
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,120
hot, let's go out.

1027
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,820
And when I said, do you guys know how to battle, oh yeah, let's go, let me show you.

1028
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,840
Gomez responds, and the guy showed me where to go and everything even though I dished

1029
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,920
him once I got into the battling world.

1030
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,520
I am now given free money and items in this group because I just have to say my mic is

1031
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,120
broken so now I can just type everything I want to say to the players.

1032
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,880
I never knew until how many Desperate Gamer guys there really are out there.

1033
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Sincerely, Gomez.

1034
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,680
I love this email.

1035
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,200
This email is fantastic.

1036
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,240
Because someone actually took a suggestion of mine and ran with it.

1037
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,240
You know what's funny?

1038
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:39,160
I'm not playing a girl in PSO because, you know, you may be new to the show so you may

1039
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,440
not have picked up on the fact that I'm a gamer who enjoys gamers of the male variety

1040
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,980
if you know what I mean, right?

1041
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,440
So I actually made a character who I would find attractive who is a male, like, you know,

1042
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,940
tall and handsome type guy, right?

1043
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,560
And that's the character I made.

1044
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,400
But the thing is that luckily I had the PSO experience so I kind of was able to pick up

1045
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
PSU pretty quickly.

1046
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,860
Yes, a lot's different, but I had my friends to voice chat with and kind of figure the

1047
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,860
things out.

1048
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,080
So what does it say about me always making short, cute girls?

1049
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,080
Nothing.

1050
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,360
Because you're a short, cute girl.

1051
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:23,640
And I have to say that the one male character I made back in PSO, though, was a femoral.

1052
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,440
Just be careful, though, because, you know, I do have a friend who is, like, OMG a real

1053
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,140
female that plays Phantasy Star Universe who's been playing the beta and she has a female

1054
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,440
character in the game and people harass her on voice chat all the time.

1055
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,640
And not only that, like, I was partied with her, I saw this happen.

1056
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,600
Random guys will run up to her and do those little motions that'll make it look like they're

1057
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,860
eating her out or trying to sodomize her and, like, all this stuff.

1058
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,320
People are so stupid.

1059
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,320
I can't wait for this game to go pay so that all these people will have to, you know, if

1060
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,480
that's how they want to spend their $10 a month, then fine.

1061
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,560
But you know, at least we'll filter out a lot of the lame-os that are just playing this

1062
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
because it's free.

1063
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,560
This should have, like...

1064
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:08,360
Now, what I did mean to ask, though, you've still got your mags in that game, right?

1065
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
No.

1066
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
You kinda have.

1067
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,360
Damn!

1068
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,200
You have a house pet who apparently later can be an NPC that joins you, but it's a little

1069
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,200
different.

1070
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,200
And you feed it stuff kind of like you did the mags, but it's a little different.

1071
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
That annoys us too.

1072
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,760
Okay, I'm going back to PSO so I can use my oppa oppa.

1073
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,280
No, no, no, no, no.

1074
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,280
PSU is beautiful.

1075
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,320
I want my oppa oppa!

1076
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,560
The first time I dual-wielded sabers, I was like, oh god, I love this game.

1077
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,560
Oppa oppa.

1078
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,720
Unless I can make my pet an oppa oppa, then I'll be happy.

1079
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,720
Okay, last email.

1080
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,720
You can name it whatever you want.

1081
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Mine's named nothing.

1082
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,720
I want mine to look like an oppa oppa.

1083
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,560
It kinda does, so name it oppa oppa.

1084
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Okay.

1085
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,560
Email.

1086
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,560
Last email.

1087
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,560
This is from Mark.

1088
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,560
Hey guys.

1089
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,560
You know what?

1090
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,560
I think that that's sexist.

1091
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,560
Okay, I'm just kidding.

1092
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,560
Oh.

1093
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,560
I'm kidding.

1094
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,560
I thought that was the email.

1095
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,560
I was like, what?

1096
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,560
Explain yourself.

1097
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,840
I'm just curious as to why you released the podcast in two parts.

1098
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,540
Is it that you can't get it all edited by Monday, or is it that you hope to get people

1099
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,760
to listen to the live broadcast instead of having to wait for the two parts?

1100
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,880
To be honest, I will never listen to the live broadcast because I just don't have the time.

1101
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,640
I hope you guys can change this.

1102
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,240
Anyhow, great show as always.

1103
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,400
Thanks, Mark.

1104
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
Because we want to.

1105
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Nana nana nana.

1106
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Nana.

1107
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,400
No.

1108
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,540
We did it at first because we were a little afraid.

1109
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:25,080
We didn't know how the server would handle a two to three hour program being thrown out

1110
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,640
there all at once.

1111
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,080
So we thought by breaking it up into chunks, it wouldn't be so bad.

1112
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,600
On our old server, we used to have to worry about bandwidth a lot.

1113
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,320
On this one, we don't have to worry about that so much.

1114
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,040
Hugs and kisses to our webmaster, VX Jason XV, who makes all this shit happen behind

1115
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,280
the scenes.

1116
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,780
We split it up in the beginning, and that's just kind of worked for us.

1117
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,280
For us, it's a little harder to sit down and listen to this podcast.

1118
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,480
It looks like it's three hours long than it is to just get little bits and pieces twice

1119
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,480
a week.

1120
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,560
I don't know how we've looked at it.

1121
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,280
I have two words that explain it for me.

1122
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,280
Pee break.

1123
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,680
Hypothetically, we could, when we break the show, just put a little like...

1124
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,560
Bobby takes a break on his show, but he'll put a little noise in there.

1125
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,440
He'll edit out his break and put a little noise in there.

1126
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,840
Technically, we could do that, but I don't know.

1127
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,400
It's just kind of what's worked for us.

1128
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,120
We might change our minds later in the future.

1129
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,840
I don't know, but for right now, it's kind of what we're doing.

1130
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,160
Email us if you feel strongly one way or the other because I've heard from people that

1131
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,160
kind of like the fact that they get regular OLR content.

1132
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,160
You won't this week.

1133
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,640
There is no second part this week, but a lot of folks like their regular OLR.

1134
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,040
We're irregular this week.

1135
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,320
Yes, that's right.

1136
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,320
We're pregnant.

1137
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,440
Is that it for emails?

1138
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,280
Just because someone's pregnant doesn't mean that they have irregularity.

1139
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,280
I'm just messing.

1140
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,280
God.

1141
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
It just means they don't need enough fiber.

1142
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
I'm just messing.

1143
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,280
Jeez.

1144
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,280
I'm getting all angsty.

1145
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,540
I already did the FUs of the week lately.

1146
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:54,160
You're catching me midweek after I got off of work.

1147
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,160
Any more mailbag?

1148
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,160
No.

1149
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,320
Send us more mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1150
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,000
Give this woman more to read next week.

1151
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,280
Any more stuff and give me money.

1152
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:10,320
Anyways, there was an unconfirmed rumor this week, as every other week, that there may

1153
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:15,800
be a Blue Dragon anime series in the works.

1154
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:25,440
This is basically coming from a toy hobby figurine page from a Japanese toy company.

1155
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:37,320
It wouldn't be that far of a stretch because it is created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is

1156
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:49,440
the brainchild of Final Fantasy, and Dragon Ball Dragon Quest creator Akira Toyayama.

1157
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,400
Very strong ties to anime.

1158
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,200
They'd be kind of neat.

1159
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,600
But he also did all of the character designs for Chrono Trigger.

1160
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,160
You said Akira Toyama, right?

1161
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Yes.

1162
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,160
Okay.

1163
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah, he did all the character designs for Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger.

1164
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,080
There has been short anime series for each, or segments of anime.

1165
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,080
They have existed in anime form.

1166
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,080
Doesn't matter.

1167
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,400
They have existed in anime form at some point.

1168
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,720
So I guess we'll have to see because right now it's just rumor.

1169
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,120
If Microsoft can have their Viva Pinata show here, why can't they have a Blue Dragon anime

1170
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
there?

1171
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,120
I'd rather have Blue Dragon.

1172
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,560
Viva Pinata sucks.

1173
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,200
I watched the thing on Xbox.

1174
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,200
It wasn't the end of the world.

1175
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
It is!

1176
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Horrible!

1177
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,200
Horrible!

1178
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,640
It was bad, but if I was seven years old, I'd probably like it.

1179
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,880
Anyway, if I was seven years old, I might enjoy Bubble Bobble.

1180
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,880
No, I'm kidding.

1181
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,540
Actually, you can love Bubble Bobble no matter what your age.

1182
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,840
It is a very cute game, though, aimed at children.

1183
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,840
But guess what, kids?

1184
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,560
Don't buy your kids Bubble Bobble Revolution on the DS or they're going to be pissed off

1185
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,880
because apparently this game was not play-tested past level 30.

1186
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,960
In other words, the game is supposed to have a boss show up at level 30, and the boss does

1187
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,120
not show up, therefore rendering the game unplayable.

1188
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,120
Every time.

1189
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:20,880
A quote from the source, we have been looking very hard into this issue with Nintendo and

1190
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,840
have now determined that all of the cartridges that have been shipped in North America are

1191
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,840
faulty.

1192
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,560
Needless to say, we are extremely sorry that this situation has arisen and would like to

1193
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,400
apologize to you for this issue.

1194
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,800
We have already started the process whereby a corrected version is to be manufactured

1195
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,240
and will ensure that all customers have their copies replaced.

1196
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,120
Unfortunately, this will take 8 to 10 weeks simply because of the time required to manufacture

1197
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,200
new carts.

1198
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,360
We will update you with what you will need to do to get a replacement game as soon as

1199
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,840
this has been determined.

1200
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,200
Hey, folks, over there at Taito making this game.

1201
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,120
How about you tell us a little bit about what you're going to do for your QA processes in

1202
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,120
the future?

1203
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,240
Is it only the US one?

1204
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,440
I'm not sure.

1205
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,760
I think it's the only region this has been released in so far.

1206
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,760
Has it?

1207
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,760
I thought that it was a...

1208
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,760
Maybe.

1209
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,760
Maybe.

1210
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,760
It's the only place with a problem showing up.

1211
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,760
Well, you know what?

1212
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,960
Apparently, they were too busy playing Rainbow Islands, which also, you know, was released

1213
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,920
the same time instead of Bubble Bobble.

1214
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,720
I mean, words cannot express what a fuck up this is on Taito's part.

1215
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,720
I mean, it's...

1216
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,120
So, nobody ever played through the whole game over in their testing.

1217
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,560
You could use cheat codes to get through, I don't know, but somehow, some way, this

1218
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:36,240
really, really big flaw was overlooked.

1219
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,400
It will make me hesitate every time I go to buy a Taito game on the DS from this point

1220
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,560
forward, until they say what they're going to do to make it better.

1221
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:48,760
I guess, but then again, you know, perhaps they've learned their lesson, so to speak,

1222
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,560
so I don't know, who knows, maybe their QA will get a lot better real fast after this

1223
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,720
very embarrassing screw up, but not good, folks.

1224
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
Not good.

1225
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,800
Yeah, DMN says in our chat room, someone's getting fucking fired.

1226
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,360
Well, I'm going to raise a good point, Squeenix owns Taito now.

1227
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,440
Oh great, maybe Final Fantasy XII will be unplayable.

1228
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,080
I doubt that, though.

1229
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:22,200
There's lots of things to doubt, though, whenever anything that's involving them is, you know,

1230
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,800
coming about, but never mind, I'm not going to be bitter.

1231
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,520
Not going to be bitter.

1232
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:34,400
Anyway, speaking of releases and things, we have some stuff from THQ for launch week for

1233
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,040
the Wii 4 games.

1234
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:43,800
The first, of course, this is the big one, is Kars, for all of our Pixar fans, one of

1235
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,840
who has landed in San Jose today, who I'm probably going to be hearing about this all

1236
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,840
weekend.

1237
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
We know.

1238
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
We all know.

1239
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
What?

1240
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
I'm just messing.

1241
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,680
Oh no, no, I'm going to be hearing about it all weekend.

1242
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:04,160
Anyway, also coming out is Barnyard, Avatar the Last Airbender, and SpongeBob SquarePants

1243
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,120
Creature from the Krusty Krab.

1244
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,200
So this just confirms Loki's list from previously, in other words?

1245
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
Yeah.

1246
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,520
I don't remember the Barnyard title, but then again, I wouldn't have remembered that.

1247
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,680
It's been there, and it's just like, and you know, it's just so exciting because these

1248
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,160
are all GameCube ports of like previous months.

1249
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,320
She could have said three games are coming out for the Wii, whoop-dee and shit, and it

1250
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,960
would have had the exact same impact for me.

1251
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,160
I'm just sorry, not interested in any of these titles.

1252
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,160
You know what's really sad?

1253
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,160
I guess Kars might be cubed.

1254
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:36,080
Some of these games that I thought were new are not new, like for example, GT from Ubisoft

1255
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:41,200
is apparently a port of GT for the GameCube that came out a long time ago, and same with

1256
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,600
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, it's a port of an Xbox game that came out a while ago too.

1257
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,320
Or I think it may have been a GameCube game at one time too, but I know the Xbox version

1258
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:56,040
came out in April, and so they're nothing new, it's just a lot of ports, and I actually

1259
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:01,000
cancelled my pre-order for GT because of that, so I'm like, I'm not going to buy any fucking

1260
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,040
ports no matter how cool that little steering wheel might be.

1261
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,600
You can buy the steering wheel if you really want it.

1262
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
They are selling it separately.

1263
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,520
Use it on an Excite truck, which apparently has no online play.

1264
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,520
That's very disappointing.

1265
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,520
Rob.

1266
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,520
Rob.

1267
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,520
Rob.

1268
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,520
Rob.

1269
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,520
Rob.

1270
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,520
Rob.

1271
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,520
Rob.

1272
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,520
Rob.

1273
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,520
Rob.

1274
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,520
No.

1275
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,660
The chat room made me!

1276
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,820
Don't even think about it.

1277
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,600
The chat room made me.

1278
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,040
Rob.

1279
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,160
What?

1280
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,780
Low key, please save this show from going down the toilet anymore.

1281
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,080
Sorry.

1282
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,080
We're stuck in the U-Bend.

1283
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:42,300
Anyways, so crappy Wii games, hooray.

1284
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:51,580
Some things that are not so crappy, though, and quite fun, actually, Mario Kart GP 2 is

1285
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,580
coming to an arcade.

1286
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,580
That's the arcade one, right?

1287
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,580
Yeah.

1288
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,580
Hot!

1289
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,300
Yeah, that's the game that I played while I was drunk on my bachelor party.

1290
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,620
Why isn't that video on YouTube?

1291
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,300
Uh, because I haven't loaded it on there yet.

1292
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,740
We're going to let that happen.

1293
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:13,540
But basically, the game itself looks very similar to what we've seen before, although

1294
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:18,460
I do see some things, though, that look new, like some of the characters...

1295
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:23,580
I don't know who this is, and I don't know if you would know, Rob, but this character

1296
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,820
looks very, very familiar.

1297
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,820
Let's see here.

1298
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:27,820
I think...

1299
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:32,180
No, this is from Tomogachi or whatever, I think.

1300
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,180
That character right there.

1301
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,580
Yeah, that looks like a Tomogachi corner shop.

1302
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:39,380
So that's going to be one of the brand new characters, a Tomogachi character, and then

1303
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:48,580
it looks like you've got all your repeat characters, Wario, Mario, Luigi, Waluigi, Yoshi, Princess

1304
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:57,560
Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and then the ghosts, Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man.

1305
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,560
Very interesting.

1306
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:03,300
There's, of course, a lot more stuff that you can put on your character or your screen

1307
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,300
caps.

1308
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,300
You know how they do the webcam thing?

1309
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,140
Yeah, it's just my little finger up and put the princess hair over it.

1310
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:13,180
That's why we got to put my video on YouTube because my screen cap was hilarious when I

1311
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,180
was drunk.

1312
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,820
We'll work on that, folks.

1313
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:23,400
If you're too poor to purchase a Mario Kart GP machine, perhaps you're also too poor to

1314
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,340
buy a Wii, even though there's a huge difference in price.

1315
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,340
I don't know.

1316
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,820
That's a good question I can think of.

1317
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:33,560
If you are too poor to pick up a Nintendo Wii, you might get a chance at Toys R Us.

1318
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,180
They're doing a deal or no deal promotion.

1319
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,100
You get these things in the newspapers that are going to be coming out.

1320
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,580
They call them weekly circulars, and when you get one of these circulars, what you can

1321
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:49,100
do is you can cut out the suitcases and you can take a deal, which is 10% off any item

1322
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:53,420
in store, which I would think could be used on the Wii for a nice little saving, or no

1323
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,420
deal.

1324
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:00,220
The cashier will scan the ticket and possibly you win a Wii console or you lose your 10%

1325
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:03,020
coupon and get a 5% coupon instead.

1326
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:07,820
No word on the banker or a very scary looking Howie Mandel coming into play here, but supposedly

1327
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:13,120
25,000 Wiis are being given away as well as a $1 million prize and a trip to Los Angeles

1328
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:20,480
to go actually see the show live in person and be frightened by Howie Mandel in person.

1329
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,380
Good luck to any of our listeners that enter this.

1330
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:28,660
I forgot to mention, since we don't have the video of my playing Mario Kart GP drunk on

1331
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:34,140
YouTube, you can, however, download it for your PSP on OLRPSP.com under the download

1332
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,140
section.

1333
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:40,340
I assure the listeners it will be on YouTube by the time you hear this show.

1334
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,820
Look for username OrangeLoungeRadio.

1335
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:49,900
Well, speaking of other amusing things, guess what Xbox is going to be, guess what Microsoft

1336
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,020
is going to be doing?

1337
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,180
Charging me more microtransactions for luminous backgrounds.

1338
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,300
Actually no, it's what they're already doing.

1339
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:05,660
They're already in work on a successor to the Xbox 360.

1340
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:16,380
Basically Chris Lewis, who is the EMEA for Microsoft, their VP, sorry, has been quoted

1341
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:21,460
saying you can't sit back on your laurels in this business, the consumer won't let you,

1342
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,820
the developer certainly won't let us, so that's happening now.

1343
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:33,120
They said there's not anything they can really say on it right now, of course, but it's still

1344
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,260
very, very early on.

1345
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,660
So they're thinking ahead.

1346
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,660
This isn't a surprise.

1347
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:43,280
I mean, Xbox 360 was being worked on years in advance.

1348
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,340
Just because they're laying down the preliminary groundwork does not mean the 360 is dead.

1349
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,340
By any means.

1350
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,740
These things take years to happen.

1351
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:52,580
I think it's getting blown out of proportion a little bit by some of the gaming media out

1352
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,180
there.

1353
01:10:54,180 --> 01:11:01,340
Guess what, folks, Sony is probably working on a PlayStation 4 and Nintendo is doing a

1354
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:06,140
Wii again or whatever they're going to call it, I mean, more Wii 2.

1355
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:09,940
Who remembers the Neptune?

1356
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,860
How long did that take to eventually become the Dreamcast?

1357
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:15,100
Oh, the dolphin, huh?

1358
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,100
Yeah, I gotcha.

1359
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,100
Alright.

1360
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:24,420
Yeah, hopefully they'll, you know, maybe they'll pick a cool development name and stick to

1361
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,420
it.

1362
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,820
Remember how disappointed people were when Nintendo dropped that name Revolution and

1363
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:28,820
went with Wii?

1364
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,340
Although I think people are used to it now.

1365
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,620
You know, I think people got the sand out of their vagina now over that whole naming

1366
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,620
of the Wii.

1367
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,620
I told you.

1368
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,620
Revolution was a cool name.

1369
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,620
Wasn't I right?

1370
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,620
Simplicity.

1371
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,620
Easy to remember.

1372
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:40,620
Something people will talk about.

1373
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,940
Well, we'll see when the damn thing goes on sale.

1374
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,540
Besides, they need to save Revolution in case they come up with something really, really

1375
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,180
cool like, you know, 3D holographic projection or something like that.

1376
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,180
They tried that.

1377
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,900
It was a game called Time Stalker.

1378
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,100
Which was the big reveal on this show that Nintendo was supposedly putting in the Wii

1379
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,100
console.

1380
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,940
Yeah, but you know what?

1381
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:01,900
Somebody is still working on it apparently because that was still a quote that one of

1382
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:07,220
the game companies out there had the technology to do it, so, you know, unless PlayStation

1383
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:11,700
3 is doing that, which I don't think so, but, you know, whatever.

1384
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,180
I guess that would justify the cost.

1385
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:22,860
All right, well, when I said something about Microsoft charging on Xbox Live for little

1386
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,100
bits and pieces here and there, I wasn't joking, folks.

1387
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,500
Now, to be fair, it's not really Microsoft that sets up these fees.

1388
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,500
It is the developers.

1389
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,220
Well, wait until you hear this one.

1390
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:38,500
Electronic Arts is selling Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007 cheats on Xbox Live.

1391
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:44,540
In other words, you could just download for 200 points, unlock golfer, and unlock courses.

1392
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,660
That's 200 each.

1393
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:49,460
And you will open up all the hidden golfers and courses in the game.

1394
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,220
Don't even have to think about, oh, I've got to play through and do this.

1395
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,260
I've got to play through and do that to unlock it.

1396
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,700
So you can still play through the game the old-fashioned way and not have to pay the

1397
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,700
points.

1398
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,820
But if you just want to unlock everything right at the start, just like that, pay 200

1399
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,620
points for a simple unlock key.

1400
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,620
Good idea, bad idea.

1401
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,620
Why?

1402
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:17,180
Because it takes, why hands, actually it's more of a reflection on the society.

1403
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:23,660
So I don't want to say necessarily bad idea, just a sad idea that people are so wanton

1404
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:29,900
to instant gratification, wanton it now that they can't freaking work for something.

1405
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,420
That pisses me off.

1406
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:34,620
But Jamie, I have to have this course.

1407
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,540
My friends are coming over tonight for a Tiger Woods tournament.

1408
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,580
I have to play this course.

1409
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:43,500
I suggest you start playing the hell out of it now.

1410
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,900
Sit your ass down in that chair and play your goddamn golf.

1411
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,580
Loki, any thoughts?

1412
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:50,580
Good idea, bad idea.

1413
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:55,680
I think it's dumb just because, I mean, I guess whether they're trying to make sure

1414
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,060
that when the next Tiger Woods game comes out, which is just going to have more courses

1415
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:03,860
anyways and probably not be very different, that you'll be finished with this one because

1416
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:07,460
you'll probably have already cheated by then or finished the game.

1417
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:11,180
Is this a way for them to say, F you, game facts, F you, strategy guides.

1418
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,100
Well, they tried the same thing before.

1419
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:19,820
They had EA put out Madden NFL tutorial videos for some of the basic stuff and they were

1420
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:26,220
selling them online on Xbox Live Marketplace, stuff that should have probably been included

1421
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,220
in the game, like how to throw a pass.

1422
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:31,640
Yeah, that might be useful when I play the game.

1423
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:36,180
Jeremy Todd one in chat says, breaking news, they're going to add drivable golf carts in

1424
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,220
Tiger Woods 2008 and you'll have to pay for the steering wheel so that you'll be able

1425
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,660
to drive the golf cart.

1426
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:44,440
I would love to drive golf carts in Tiger Woods and run over people.

1427
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,300
That would sell the game for me.

1428
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:55,260
All right, well, that's just about it for the gaming news tonight, but it's not it for

1429
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:59,460
everything we've got to say because you know Dark Soccer, she has to surf the web up and

1430
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:05,140
down and left and right every single week and find a site for your viewing pleasure

1431
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,420
and it's featured here in the website of the week.

1432
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:14,740
Dark Soccer, where should the kids be pointing their browsers right now?

1433
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:21,060
I would suggest the site of false advertising, a gallery of parody.

1434
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:34,460
It's at parody.organiq.com and it's got lots of neat little false ads basically, you just

1435
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:39,900
scroll through the site and it's basically like one of them is star sucks coffee, drink

1436
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:46,620
our coffee or we'll break your legs and radio shit, you've got money, we've got pockets.

1437
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,660
So for those folks that like, you know, funny ha ha parody ads.

1438
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:54,660
My favorite one on here is like the fourth one in, it's an ad for Prozac, it says you'd

1439
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,100
kill them without it, it shows a picture of a family.

1440
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,340
Do they have a parody ad of the whole, you remember it was controversial about two months

1441
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,540
ago, they had the white PSP ads, do we have any parodies of that?

1442
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:09,620
No, I haven't seen any so far, I've seen Calvin Clone dare to be the same.

1443
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,700
Get working on that folks.

1444
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:17,060
And Baby Gasp, next week I'll outgrow this, it's pretty funny.

1445
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:21,820
Check it out boys and girls, Dark Soccer's website of the week.

1446
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,900
One other thing we've been featuring here pretty weekly here on Orange Lounge Radio

1447
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,340
are DDR previews.

1448
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:34,220
We've been previewing new tracks of DDR games upcoming on the Xbox and Xbox 360 systems

1449
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:39,180
and guys you know what, next week is the last week for this, cry, sob, well that's right

1450
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,860
the games will be out soon enough.

1451
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:45,820
We still have more songs soon enough, well I guess after what you've learned tonight

1452
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:50,700
maybe not that soon for Universe, but we do know that Ultramix 4 is coming, so at least

1453
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,520
we can give you a little taste of what you can expect in March, that's alright, March

1454
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,100
is a slow period anyway.

1455
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,100
Who releases games today?

1456
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,100
March is actually pretty heavy.

1457
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,100
Is it?

1458
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,100
Yeah.

1459
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,100
I thought it was April.

1460
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,100
April got heavier.

1461
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,100
No, April starts to die down again.

1462
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,080
March is like the end of fiscal quarter months.

1463
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,140
Well then I obviously don't know what I'm talking about so let's get to the music.

1464
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:12,900
We have two new tracks tonight from DDR Ultramix 4 and two new tracks from DDR Universe, let's

1465
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:17,180
start it off with a track from DDR Ultramix 4, no long versions tonight folks, sorry to

1466
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,180
say, just have some short tracks for you guys.

1467
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:23,940
This first song is from DDR Ultramix 4, it's by a group called Neuroactive and the song

1468
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:28,540
is called More Serotonin, enjoy it here on the sneak peaks.

1469
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:58,060
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one.

1470
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:21,740
Bye!

1471
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:05,060
I was neuroactive with more serotonin here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.

1472
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:11,500
I caught myself doing the little head bob thing, Night at a Roxbury, during that song.

1473
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,260
For a dancy-trancy song, not bad.

1474
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,260
I like that.

1475
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,660
This is a good edit.

1476
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:22,120
If dancy-trancy isn't your thing, remember that these games keep a variety of music.

1477
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:26,780
This one is definitely a unique sounding song, this next song we have coming up.

1478
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,780
It's very interesting.

1479
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,780
It's interesting.

1480
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:35,300
It looked like someone cut a really stinky fart.

1481
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,100
No, it's just different.

1482
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,820
It was not what I expected when I first heard this song.

1483
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:42,280
You guys see if maybe it's more your thing?

1484
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:47,620
It's by Wave Group, featuring Scotty D. They did that Stompin' at the Gotham song last

1485
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,500
week, which was awesome, that jazzy one we all liked.

1486
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,500
See if you like this one.

1487
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,780
It's called Bongo, here on the Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.

1488
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,780
Bongo.

1489
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:56,780
Hear that?

1490
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:05,900
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

1491
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:13,900
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

1492
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:36,700
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

1493
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:57,900
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

1494
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:22,860
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

1495
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:36,380
Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.

1496
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:42,220
That is Bongo, by Wave Group, featuring Scotty D, coming soon to DDR Universe.

1497
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,220
See what I'm telling you?

1498
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:44,220
It's a little different.

1499
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:45,220
That song is growing on me.

1500
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:50,300
I like the whole Austin Powers 60's spy theme vibe that song has going.

1501
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:54,060
I think, with all due respect to the folks that wrote that and sang it, I think it's

1502
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,100
the voiceovers that kind of bugged me a little bit.

1503
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,100
I don't know.

1504
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:01,100
It's a little weird and out of place to me, but it'll probably be...

1505
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,740
Songs sound different when you're just listening to them than when you do when you're actually

1506
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:08,180
playing them and dancing to them when they're coming out of your TV, so I'm sure I won't

1507
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:09,180
even notice.

1508
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:10,180
All right.

1509
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,840
Let's go to a song from DDR UltraMix 4, and this one's pretty exciting.

1510
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,540
This is by a group called Real Life.

1511
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:19,860
You might remember, years ago in the 80's, they did that song Send Me an Angel, and they

1512
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:23,140
would still play it in clubs around the nation, right?

1513
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:28,580
So they have a song in DDR UltraMix 4, it's called Oblivion, and it was remixed by Nevaraka,

1514
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:31,460
who did some of the other remixes in previous UltraMix games.

1515
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:36,180
I didn't realize that they sung the original of that.

1516
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,540
I have the Nevaraka mix, I just need to listen to the original.

1517
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:39,540
There it is.

1518
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:55,860
Real Life with Oblivion here on Orange Launch Radio, sneak peeks.

1519
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:17,700
We are in my heart, I am running out of the truth.

1520
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:28,700
I'm running out of the truth Whatever I do I never want to hurt you

1521
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:35,700
When it comes to this I feel fine but I have to admit

1522
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:41,700
Here in my heart I'm running out of the truth

1523
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:54,700
Life goes on and the world turns round Yeah, life goes on and the world turns round

1524
01:23:54,700 --> 01:24:21,700
Cynthia, bring it on Cynthia, bring it on

1525
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:34,700
I'm running out of the truth

1526
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:59,700
I'm running out of the truth

1527
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:04,700
Let's enjoy!

01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:38,700
