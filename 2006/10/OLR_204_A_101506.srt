00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:15,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, October 15th, 2006.

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,040
[SPEAKER_01]: More details on the E3 makeover.

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,361
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation 3 and Wii's are pre-ordered around the nation.

4
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:26,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the annoying things about the next game generation?

5
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:32,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:38,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,025
[SPEAKER_08]: We are that internet radio program.

8
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,231
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

9
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:10,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

10
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:11,295
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

11
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:17,577
[SPEAKER_03]: You were... I remember now, so... And then I fell into a coma for eight hours because I have a sinus infection.

12
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:18,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to hear that.

13
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:19,917
[SPEAKER_08]: So sick Jamie's back.

14
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:25,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Those folks that have been listening to the podcast for a long time know that Jamie was sick for a while.

15
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it started from a sinus infection.

16
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So my doctors are like, okay, pick your antibiotic.

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I get to choose?

18
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:38,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm on erythromycin, which hates my whole digestive system.

19
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer C-Pro, just five tablets, but that's just me.

20
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry, we're not the drug show.

21
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:44,864
[SPEAKER_08]: We're Orange Lounge Radio.

22
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Aren't we, Loki?

23
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:46,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Techmaster Loki is also here.

24
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:47,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

25
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:48,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, how you doing?

26
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:49,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we're not the drug show.

27
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I like your shirt.

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,011
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a Me and Mike Katamari shirt on.

29
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:53,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

30
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:55,393
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I never played that on PSP.

31
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:56,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I just kind of missed it.

32
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:58,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking forward to it, and then I was kind of like, eh.

33
00:01:58,496 --> 00:01:59,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it a little bit and got bored.

34
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:00,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you?

35
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Really quick.

36
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it just not the same on the little screen?

37
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:05,822
[SPEAKER_08]: The lack of a second analog stick.

38
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:08,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Cramps my hand up very badly.

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:22,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it was just like kind of Metroid Prime Hunter Syndrome where, you know, you just have to stop playing because it hurts your hand and it's just not, I don't know, it's like trying to control a car with a brick or something instead of a steering wheel.

40
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

41
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually got the urge to play Katamari Damacy yesterday.

42
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:30,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I was lying on the couch kind of just, you know, having one of those lazy days where I'm like, I'm not going to move from this spot.

43
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:34,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm looking over at my game collection, which is, you know, kind of next to the TV, and then I'm like,

44
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:36,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to roll over things.

45
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play Katamari Damacy.

46
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:43,355
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something very stress relieving about that game.

47
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:43,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't explain it.

48
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,538
[SPEAKER_08]: We get that feeling every day during work.

49
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,280
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we have to have our killing breaks.

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

51
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Hence the Liberty City stories.

52
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:51,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

53
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:59,051
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to your gaming week in just a minute, but I do want to introduce an old favorite of ours that's sitting here tonight on the ground hacking something on the computer over there.

54
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello to Miklatov.

55
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:01,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't say train.

56
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,070
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with trains?

57
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:03,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

58
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,401
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:02,019
[SPEAKER_08]: My Michelle rocks, just for the record.

60
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:02,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

61
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:24,672
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

62
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:34,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made myself an Xbox Live account, and so I have my own gamertag now.

63
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:37,402
[SPEAKER_08]: After all this time, you finally made your own damn account.

64
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:38,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the PSU demo.

65
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:38,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

66
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I haven't played yet, I just downloaded it.

67
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:41,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

68
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:45,788
[SPEAKER_03]: But for anyone who wants to know, oh my god, I'm going to regret this.

69
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go to the forums and look it up.

70
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:52,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go to the forums and look it up, because I posted it on the gamertag.

71
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,135
[SPEAKER_08]: See, then it's free advertisement for the forums.

72
00:04:55,742 --> 00:05:12,172
[SPEAKER_03]: and then this doesn't have to do with anything about well actually playing a game but it made me think of it since you guys were talking about Katamari is I had a dream on like Thursday night that I was rolling a Katamari over my work you remember the last time I had dreams about that right?

73
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I left that job really?

74
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:23,359
[SPEAKER_08]: to another one makes me think of that ad that was on I think it was for like a bank or a credit card or something that showed the Katamari rolling down the hills of San Francisco I mean it

75
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:29,183
[SPEAKER_08]: The ad agency denied it was inspired by Katamari, but that's what any gamer would think about when they see that commercial.

76
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,524
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, oh, haha, Katamari.

77
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:38,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I still have the parody that I made from when I worked at the student loan place, so I'll post it up in the chat room.

78
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

79
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:45,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It was okay.

80
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:46,748
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I play?

81
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:47,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play a whole lot.

82
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:51,010
[SPEAKER_09]: More Saints Row, because that game is really fun.

83
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally...

84
00:05:53,035 --> 00:06:09,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally stole a Titan, which is an armored car with money in it, and I have been performing the wonderful money duping glitch that's in the game, where you can basically blow this car up over and over, collecting the money in it, and buying it over again.

85
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:09,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun stuff.

86
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:17,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto, of course, Liberty City Stories, still waiting for Vice City Stories, only a few more weeks, a few more weeks, then we can switch games, finally.

87
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:18,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

88
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, really not a whole lot.

89
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:31,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I was meaning to set up my PlayStation 2 and play some games on that, but I need to buy a VGA cable for it so I can hook it up to my computer because unfortunately Nelly wants to hog the TV with Zuma.

90
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,550
[SPEAKER_08]: But she's not a gamer.

91
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,970
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not at all.

92
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,731
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a single gamer, I guess.

93
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:42,533
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, unfortunately I can't really play the games on there, so I have to wait for that.

94
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus I'm also packing because I'm moving next week, so...

95
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,624
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of puts a damper on playing games and stuff.

96
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:52,325
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did play a little bit of Dig Dug, which is kind of neat because that came out this week.

97
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

98
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:55,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just Dig Dug.

99
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:56,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what do you expect?

100
00:06:56,826 --> 00:07:00,827
[SPEAKER_09]: And then tried a little bit more of Need for Speed Carbon.

101
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,627
[SPEAKER_09]: The demo is pretty awesome, actually.

102
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty impressed with it so far.

103
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:09,109
[SPEAKER_09]: So you may need to check that out once the game finally makes its way out here.

104
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:22,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, then of course, I know there's some, I tried playing the multiplayer demo of Splinter Cell, uh, Double Agent, but unfortunately at the time I was torrenting a bunch of stuff and Xbox Live didn't like that too much.

105
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,011
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'll have to try that next week.

106
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's about all I played, yeah.

107
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:29,815
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

108
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:33,537
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week, a lot of the old standbys.

109
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:37,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, a little more progress in Enchanted Arms.

110
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,020
[SPEAKER_08]: New stuff I checked out this week, though.

111
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded Dig Dug when it came out on Wednesday.

112
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:49,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of the old Namco classics that have been released recently, Pac-Man and Galaga,

113
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:50,469
[SPEAKER_08]: DiggDugg

114
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it was cool.

115
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of, you know, a little bit of memories.

116
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:22,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit, though, I'm a little bit disappointed, as I'm sure most Xbox fans are feeling, is that it seems like we just had nothing but a barrage over the past couple months of rehashed old classic games, and we're really looking forward to some of the new stuff, you know, Luminous.

117
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Castle Crashers, and all this other stuff that's supposed to be coming out.

118
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:30,443
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe I heard somewhere that Xbox has their stuff.

119
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:41,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say when we did the story last week about Duke Nukem, and the possibilities of that coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, that they had said that Xbox Live has its calendar full through the end of the year, or something like that.

120
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of like, why aren't we seeing releases every week then?

121
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Or why aren't we seeing more homegrown stuff?

122
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't they do releases more than one game a week?

123
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:50,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that so difficult?

124
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:51,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

125
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

126
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:54,799
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, so, you know, Dig Dug, yay.

127
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Another classic game, not so yay.

128
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the value of $5, can't really complain.

129
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:05,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, got really easy achievements if you're into hoarding up the achievements.

130
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:09,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, no multiplayer or any of that stuff.

131
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,344
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's Dig Dug.

132
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:19,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Either you remember it from your childhood and you love it, or you'll download the demo and think, oh, another 1980s game that I may or may not buy, depending on

133
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,331
[SPEAKER_08]: How much nostalgia means to me.

134
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Going from something very nostalgic to something very new, it's kind of nostalgic in a way.

135
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:33,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I also played Mortal Kombat Armageddon on PlayStation 2, which is, you know, the clusterfuck Mortal Kombat, so to speak.

136
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:41,859
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, every single character was ever in a Mortal Kombat game except for like one obscure, you know, you don't even remember this chick.

137
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,360
[SPEAKER_08]: But like most, every single character's in it, yeah?

138
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

139
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you try the Mario Kart type game?

140
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:47,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

141
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,796
[SPEAKER_08]: The Motor Combat or whatever it's called.

142
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:51,157
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cheesy.

143
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:54,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't expect... It's not a racing game, okay?

144
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Mortal Kombat Armageddon was not designed to be a racing game.

145
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,345
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely something extra they tacked on.

146
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute, it's fun, but it'll get old fast.

147
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

148
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:41,851
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

149
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:07,611
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

150
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:39,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the last one technically was Shell and Monks, so that wasn't really a Mortal Kombat game.

151
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:40,346
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, not that one.

152
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:41,047
[SPEAKER_08]: The one before it.

153
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:41,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Deception.

154
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Deception, yeah.

155
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually think I kind of preferred that one.

156
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:46,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So what if it didn't have the big cluster of characters?

157
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,772
[SPEAKER_08]: It had enough to keep the game fresh and moving.

158
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,222
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, this is definitely fan service.

159
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:59,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the other disappointing thing about this game is I'm kind of surprised it's not next-gen.

160
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if they went next-gen with it, then maybe they could have squeezed all that stuff into it.

161
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:06,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, it probably would have been in development for another year, but, you know, I don't know.

162
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:08,709
[SPEAKER_08]: They're probably working on one.

163
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:09,509
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

164
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:15,812
[SPEAKER_08]: For a fighting game, you know, considering the amount of variety you get with this game, you know, it's actually pretty good.

165
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:18,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I don't know, it's a fighting game itself.

166
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:19,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel a game like...

167
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:32,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Soul Calibur 2 or 3 even is much more intricate in the fighting styles, whereas this is just variety, fan service, you know, just throwing tons of different things at you.

168
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So, take it as you will.

169
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that's about it.

170
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:38,867
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing, but we'll get to that later.

171
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll ask Miklatov, how was your gaming week?

172
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:48,756
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was pretty good, shockingly, since I'm not only playing Final Fantasy XI anymore.

173
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:56,660
[SPEAKER_04]: This week I played a good amount of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Luminous Live on Xbox Live.

174
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

175
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,302
[SPEAKER_08]: How come the rest of us haven't gotten a chance to play that?

176
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you guys don't use Microsoft's network.

177
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:04,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

178
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:05,284
[SPEAKER_08]: You're special.

179
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:05,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm special.

180
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a great time with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

181
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:11,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous Live, not so much.

182
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:15,549
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 controller really, really, really sucks for that game.

183
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:18,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I also picked up

184
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:20,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Three new games this week.

185
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:30,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and that's kind of boring, but it got me through the Wii pre-order line on Friday.

186
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:37,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I also picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner, and that's a really, really neat game.

187
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:38,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too far in it.

188
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And I picked up Mortal Kombat Armageddon.

189
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:47,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a decent game, but they screwed up Rain and he was my favorite character.

190
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was not too happy about that.

191
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:57,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, haven't really played much else, I guess, except for what we'll be talking about later.

192
00:13:58,094 --> 00:13:59,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's about it.

193
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:07,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, other questions in chat room, uh, the always present extra guest on our show, orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat.

194
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:13,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeremy Todd 1 asks, Miklatov, so you're saying the shitty 360 controllers D-pad works good for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3?

195
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:20,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yeah, because you can perform the rolling moves, like, you know, down to forward and stuff like that, really easily.

196
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:27,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, yeah, I would say it works pretty well for Mortal Kombat, uh, 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, rather.

197
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:29,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter 2

198
00:14:54,686 --> 00:15:00,831
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another comment in chatroom, Blaze said, Sky, the original Mortal Kombat never had the variety, it's a true throwback.

199
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:05,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess, but you know, your expectation level of fighting games was different back then.

200
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,478
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, come to think of it, that was kind of one of Mortal Kombat's weaknesses in the beginning.

201
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:16,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, it had fatalities, but the first one, as great of a game as it is, it is a little clunky.

202
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:17,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially on the Genesis.

203
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:20,326
[SPEAKER_08]: How would you like to create a fatality mode in that?

204
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:21,549
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

205
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:49,691
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem with that is that once you've gone through that, there actually isn't this level of variety that you'd think.

206
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was a lot cooler when everybody had their own unique thing they did.

207
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:54,750
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

208
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,369
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

209
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,448
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

210
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,106
[SPEAKER_03]: No one found me.

211
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:12,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a big place.

212
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:17,749
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to be at YowieCon next weekend.

213
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:21,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will be cosplaying as an Organization 13 member.

214
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will see me.

215
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd!

216
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chris and Megzy are doing it too.

217
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:25,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerds!

218
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:27,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but we're cute nerds.

219
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:31,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to be in the big trench coats with stuff.

220
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:33,514
[SPEAKER_03]: If you find me...

221
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:37,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you will get a CD sampler.

222
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:39,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Some CDs from a different drum.

223
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

224
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we have little three-inch singles.

225
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:48,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Rain Dancer with Come With Me and Rupesh Kartel, Death With Soft Names.

226
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:56,890
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the B-sides on that single is Yours To Command, which is one of the new Ditter songs that we premiered earlier on in the DDR preview segment.

227
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you find me, if I'm not completely fawning over, you know, the...

228
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:05,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Yowie Action, then you get a present.

229
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:06,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say the Mangina.

230
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,570
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will also make this disclaimer.

231
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:15,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be seeing Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D at the Metreon on Friday night.

232
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will extend it there.

233
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:23,276
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody recognizes me, you get the CD.

234
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:24,077
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

235
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,418
[SPEAKER_03]: If not at YowieCon, then at the Metreon.

236
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:30,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I worry maybe I should give you some more because there might be a lot of our listeners at YowieCon.

237
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:30,459
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

238
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,620
[SPEAKER_03]: First three people.

239
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:32,749
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

240
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:34,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we got a lot of these.

241
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,871
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a lot of these, so there you go.

242
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:39,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of them are for YaoiCon, one is for Nightmare Before Christmas.

243
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:40,714
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

244
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:42,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Right there, three pairs to give away.

245
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:43,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun.

246
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:48,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so go find DarkSakura at YaoiCon.

247
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:49,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

248
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you... I thought... Oh, never mind.

249
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:54,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob can't count!

250
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:55,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought she already had one.

251
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:56,483
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

252
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:58,063
[SPEAKER_08]: She wants to keep one for herself.

253
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:58,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I see how it is.

254
00:18:58,724 --> 00:18:59,064
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

255
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually forgot that I already had one, but I will.

256
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:01,943
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

257
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:02,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun.

258
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:03,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Give those singles away.

259
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:08,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be traveling as well this weekend.

260
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:10,390
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the weekend where I'm finally going to New York City.

261
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:14,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I missed digital life by one whole week because I'm just cool like that.

262
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:23,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be in New York City this weekend, and I took some listeners' advice and scheduled a time to be at the Nintendo World Store.

263
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:24,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's the thing.

264
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:30,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't exactly cleared it with them or anything, and I'm not expecting a swarm of people.

265
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:33,038
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't exactly have that many people that listen to the program.

266
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:38,479
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will be there Saturday at noon, so come look for me at the Nintendo World Store.

267
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:38,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

268
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take some CDs, too, so they can come find me.

269
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a West Coast, East Coast thing.

270
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:45,941
[SPEAKER_08]: You can come find Jamie on the West Coast, and you can come find me on the East Coast.

271
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:46,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So he can find more.

272
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:47,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

273
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:51,817
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be Saturday at noon at the Nintendo World Store.

274
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:53,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be there.

275
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:55,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki you can find on his couch all weekend long.

276
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be on my couch at my house.

277
00:19:58,142 --> 00:19:59,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably getting some.

278
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:01,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, probably.

279
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,968
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will have a CD in case you find me.

280
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:07,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in case.

281
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Mikotov, will you be anywhere for the fans to meet?

282
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:11,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no one knows what you look like anyway.

283
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:12,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they don't.

284
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be at work, probably.

285
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:17,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you find me at work...

286
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a high five, because I don't have CDs.

287
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:21,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

288
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:25,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I should, because the picture on the form is sort of outdated.

289
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:33,446
[SPEAKER_03]: My hair is dyed red now with black streaks in the front, so it will probably be straight, not curly.

290
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:38,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you look a little different than you do in the album art that you see on iTunes, because that picture is like six months old.

291
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,772
[SPEAKER_03]: More than that, we did those pictures last winter.

292
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:42,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

293
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:43,234
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for new pictures.

294
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:43,694
[SPEAKER_03]: We need new ones.

295
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:44,792
[SPEAKER_08]: New ones.

296
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:45,393
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

297
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:49,855
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone looks at my DeviantArt account on my Deviant tag, that's what my hair looks like.

298
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:52,596
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

299
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:53,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So come find us.

300
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:57,778
[SPEAKER_08]: New York City, Saturday, YaliCon, Metreon, all weekend long.

301
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Launch Radio invades coast to coast.

302
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,741
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR previews a little bit later on in this segment.

303
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Two new songs from Ultramix 4 and two new songs from DDR Universe.

304
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:07,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight.

305
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:09,624
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, some gaming news.

306
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:10,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

307
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:12,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of gaming news.

308
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:17,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, like every year, we were looking forward to E3.

309
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:20,095
[SPEAKER_08]: The key word is were.

310
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:27,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, E3, as announced earlier this year, has been downsized.

311
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:35,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we won't be able to see this wonderful giant expo with 60,000 plus people in it and

312
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyways, here's the details on what's going to be happening with this.

313
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:42,693
[SPEAKER_08]: It's now being called the E3 Media and Business Summit.

314
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:49,678
[SPEAKER_08]: It will take place between July 11th and the 13th in Santa Monica, California.

315
00:21:50,579 --> 00:22:01,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're actually going to be taking up several hotels as well as the large Barker Hangar, which is going to be kind of a show floor type thing.

316
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:02,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

317
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess a place that they can use to demonstrate stuff.

318
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:16,267
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's going to be invite only and basically according to Doug Lowenstein this is kind of how he's summing up the whole E3.

319
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:18,428
[SPEAKER_08]: E3 is not a place where a product is sold anymore.

320
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:28,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The industry is recognized as a big part of mainstream culture so the need for a big glittering event to validate the industry is not what it used to be.

321
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,171
[SPEAKER_08]: What is needed is to focus on the fact that E3 is going to be much more

322
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,951
[SPEAKER_08]: about media-related opportunities.

323
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:41,372
[SPEAKER_08]: The question is, what is the most efficient way to create those opportunities?

324
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my question to Doug Lewenstein there.

325
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:53,896
[SPEAKER_08]: When you say media, do you mean media or the people that have TV shows and giant multi-million dollar websites?

326
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:59,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Because talking with some of the other publishers out there, that seems to be the case.

327
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:01,819
[SPEAKER_08]: They just kind of want to ignore the smaller guys.

328
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:02,539
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

329
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:10,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Just remember that the smaller guys do have a reach out there in the marketplace and do contact your customers.

330
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:17,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So take that in mind when you're picking those select thousands of people that are going to be at this event.

331
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:27,172
[SPEAKER_08]: So that whole thing where he says there's no need for E3 to be the glittering event it once was, he's basically saying, Paris Hilton, stay home!

332
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:34,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep your skanky ass at home with your dumb little dog and get the hell away from my show.

333
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:36,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And to that I say amen.

334
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I understand because there are a lot of people there and it's hard to conduct business.

335
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:48,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it's good to have the publicity for your games, especially the smaller companies.

336
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:55,315
[SPEAKER_08]: They want people noticing their game there because then it gets covered and then the word spreads about it.

337
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:55,955
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think

338
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:58,031
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

339
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:17,149
[SPEAKER_08]: at a recent media event.

340
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:21,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Big Boy saying that's essentially what they did is they copy-pasted from the press release.

341
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that's what you want, you know, why bother throwing a show?

342
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:25,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Just fucking email E3.

343
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:29,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Just put E3 in a zip file and send it to their email.

344
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:30,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Web conference.

345
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in a conference room with those intercom things.

346
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:34,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

347
00:24:35,377 --> 00:24:37,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just worried, personally, I'm worried we're not going to be invited.

348
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,219
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my only worry.

349
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:44,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, and it would be very disappointing to me because I really do care about, you know,

350
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:46,435
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

351
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:12,969
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

352
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:49,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Scott over at All Games and the folks at Arena Interactive Lounge where we broadcast they're probably having a fucking field day at this news they're probably so excited but I also think and I'm not insinuating anything I don't know shit about what they're doing next year but just knowing the type of guy that Scott is

353
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:51,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Outpost is where it's at next year.

354
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:52,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss my yearly playing of Xtango.

355
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor Xtango.

356
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:26,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, yeah, Scott, if you're listening, get the Xtango folks at Arena.

357
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them to give me a copy.

358
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can ask them if their game's ever going to freaking come out.

359
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:32,394
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be nice.

360
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,858
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be part of the brand new Duke Nukem Forever.

361
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on the Phantom.

362
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:40,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

363
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:51,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of games that we've been waiting for, the demo for Phantasy Star Universe on Xbox 360 is out.

364
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:54,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Today being Sunday for us.

365
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:56,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the last day that you can download it.

366
00:26:58,214 --> 00:27:02,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was down midnight on Saturday.

367
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:03,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, whatever.

368
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:07,916
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time the people who download this show hear it, it's too late.

369
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:09,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, it sucked.

370
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:13,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at any rate, I haven't played mine yet.

371
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:17,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I did download it yesterday, which is why I made my whole Gamertag account and everything.

372
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,492
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will be up for play until Wednesday midnight.

373
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the only time you're going to get to.

374
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:29,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's already been in Japan forever, and I already know someone who has it on PC.

375
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:35,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what's really pissy, though, about the Japanese release is that your CDs are all coded much like the...

376
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:37,802
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

377
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:09,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the actual release is out, it will be $9.99 a month for our European listeners.

378
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,861
[SPEAKER_03]: That's $6.99 pounds.

379
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:26,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that it will be available for your license, or they're calling it Guardian License, will be available for purchase beginning the 24th of November on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.

380
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:31,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Luckily, all the achievements are offline, so I can just rent this thing, which is excellent.

381
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:32,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Whore.

382
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:36,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And note the other best part about that beta demo.

383
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Tuesday that Xbox Live is going to be down the whole day.

384
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:42,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So you actually only get about two days to play that.

385
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:43,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Sega.

386
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:44,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's right.

387
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox Live is going to be down Tuesday.

388
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:46,596
[SPEAKER_08]: So whoops.

389
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:47,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoopsie-daisy.

390
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:48,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Forgot to plan for that.

391
00:28:48,957 --> 00:28:49,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well.

392
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:50,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at any rate.

393
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:56,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already out on PC in Japan and that hasn't stopped people.

394
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,283
[SPEAKER_03]: There is someone who is on one of the big Phantasy Star sites.

395
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:12,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm not going to list names publicly.

396
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:17,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Has made a loading tool for this to bypass the online registration.

397
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:23,094
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot play it online, but you can play it in single player mode if you want to try out the PC version.

398
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look around.

399
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:26,557
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out there.

400
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:30,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually got to play the PSU demo.

401
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:33,360
[SPEAKER_08]: or Beta, whatever you want to call it.

402
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the thing is, though, it's kind of hard for me to base my judgment off of Beta because...

403
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:40,587
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

404
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:15,608
[SPEAKER_08]: What I did get to play, the only problem I had with it is the tutorial was a little bit clunky and would freeze up, so it was easier to bypass it.

405
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:22,632
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you bypass the tutorial, then you kind of don't know what you're doing in the game because just enough has changed from Phantasy Star Online.

406
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:30,477
[SPEAKER_08]: But finally, once I figured it out and got in there, it was kind of fun, and I played with a stranger through one level, and it ran pretty well.

407
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,640
[SPEAKER_08]: and I gotta say, some of the sceneries are really nice.

408
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:48,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you figure out, once you go to the, for those that are playing the beta, go up to the fourth floor, go out the left side, and then you can transport to different planets, and you can transport to this greenish planet that has like a very, like, um...

409
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:49,569
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

410
00:31:11,977 --> 00:31:14,881
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

411
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:45,708
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that I sort of hope is that, you know, since we've done this massive download, it would be nice, though, that for the folks that actually have gone into the effort of downloading the game, that we could just play off the downloaded version, but maybe there could be, like, a quick mode or something that they actually use the demo version for.

412
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:47,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

413
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:51,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they already said you're not going to be able to transfer your character you made in the beta over, so... Yeah, that's ridiculous.

414
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:52,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well.

415
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:53,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Mikotov, what do you think?

416
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:54,995
[SPEAKER_08]: You spent a lot of time playing this.

417
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:56,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like it.

418
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:20,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a few really glaring issues with it though So I play as a force on Phantasy Star Online because they're the best And in this game, from what I can tell so far Is that the only way I can do magic is if I equip it to a weapon So I'm going to have to carry multiple weapons Or maybe, I don't know I'm talking as loud as I can

419
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:28,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to equip multiple weapons so I can have different magic spells and that's going to really make me angry.

420
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:34,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like that Sega's crazy word filtering stuff still happens.

421
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Like somebody had to use periods to cuss at me today and it was pretty funny.

422
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:42,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Why were they cussing at you?

423
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're like 12 year olds that are playing Xbox Live.

424
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:46,516
[SPEAKER_08]: OMG free game.

425
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:48,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly like what you said earlier.

426
00:32:50,796 --> 00:33:18,790
[SPEAKER_03]: voice chat, I don't know I didn't party because I don't want to play with other people right now I believe voice chat is only available once you get into a zone it's not like in the lobby like it was in the first game I think it actually is, it's in party but one thing though for anybody who is playing on Sega's website, they do have a feedback form they want feedback from the beta apparently, so make sure that if you see any glitches, anything weird, anything you don't like

427
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you post about it on their page.

428
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't it seem like they're kind of a little close, though, with only ten days to go?

429
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:25,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is this going to be another eight days?

430
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:34,203
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's something that just requires a general tweak or a change in code, then... But the games have already been shipped to retailers, essentially, waiting to go out.

431
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:37,085
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's talking about, like, major glitches.

432
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:44,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, but here we go again, another Xbox 360 game where they're patching it on the back end to fix all the bugs.

433
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:47,174
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm just kind of like... That happens with any type of MMO.

434
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:52,183
[SPEAKER_03]: MMOs exist to be glitchy.

435
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:58,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope it doesn't stay, you know, Wrappy Christmas for five years like the old Xbox one.

436
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:03,970
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucks that it is glitchy, but we shouldn't expect MMOs to be glitchy.

437
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,092
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just fucking laziness in programming is what it is.

438
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:13,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you should be doing extensive beta testing, especially since the game came out already in Japan.

439
00:34:13,736 --> 00:34:18,359
[SPEAKER_08]: You've already got some beta testing right there, whatever you want to call it, but

440
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:25,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's really ridiculous just to say, oh yeah, this is a beta test and hopefully everything goes well because we already done the game.

441
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,554
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we find a bug, yeah, that fucking sucks.

442
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:31,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other thoughts on PSU?

443
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other thing I don't like about it, and I know I'm being negative about it, but I do really like the game.

444
00:34:38,473 --> 00:35:00,278
[SPEAKER_04]: At least in PSO, you all kind of look the same, like, you know, all the forces had dresses and such, but their creation in this game, while it's highly detailed, the costumes, each, like, the numens and the humans for each gender, they all get the same costumes, so...

445
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,856
[SPEAKER_04]: You see a lot of the same people running around.

446
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:10,261
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty terrible, because, I mean, I don't want to see a whole bunch of people with just the black and red shirt on.

447
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:15,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't seem like anybody's really, you know, their own character because of it.

448
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:20,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I do understand that the RBG slider has been removed to change color.

449
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:21,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

450
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know it was there in, like... It was in the old ones.

451
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:25,252
[SPEAKER_03]: You could change the colors of the outfits.

452
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, um, no, it was...

453
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,852
[SPEAKER_03]: The hair and different tones.

454
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:32,313
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it for some of the hairs.

455
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:36,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And the eyes and stuff, which is really cool because you can do eyes before.

456
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:37,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just depending on your face.

457
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:46,342
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, at least there were different patterns on the different outfits you could pick in PSO.

458
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:50,164
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's just palette swaps and they look pretty terrible.

459
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:57,269
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, since Miklatov likes to play a force, essentially what he's saying is he misses being able to wear a dress in Phantasy Star Online.

460
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, I kind of do.

461
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:03,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like a Force if I'm wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt.

462
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:03,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

463
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:08,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, the Forces were great because the men had these evening gowns.

464
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:13,688
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm thinking is they probably removed some of the stuff for the beta.

465
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:15,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because it's, you know, they cut down the file size.

466
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:19,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's actually like that on the PC version.

467
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to, I actually have to ask my friend who's been playing it.

468
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:26,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hopefully they'll release more later.

469
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:26,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

470
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:27,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

471
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to another Xbox-related story.

472
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:56,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft is teaming up with Best Buy and the Boys and Girls Club of America to go on a 20-city bus tour.

473
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:05,259
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be educating parents on the ESRB rating scheme and how to implement parental controls on the Xbox 360 and the Xbox Live service.

474
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:12,065
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, hopefully there'll be a tutorial on how to block asses on the Xbox 360 cams for parents.

475
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:12,986
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know,

476
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:21,643
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a nice, you know, good service, feel-good community thing, but it certainly doesn't help in selling parents on Xbox 360s, does it?

477
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:24,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry?

478
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:24,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it does.

479
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:27,363
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

480
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:49,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, the tour is going to be going around pretty much the top cities in the U.S.

481
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:56,335
[SPEAKER_08]: where the most people are, you know, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle.

482
00:37:56,996 --> 00:38:02,619
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to check out the full schedule, you can always check out xbox.com slash isyourfamilyset.

483
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your family set, Loki?

484
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:09,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I would hope so, because I don't have a family.

485
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:11,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm set, so, you know...

486
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:17,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sat and ready to see some Xbox Cam boobies and cocks.

487
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's make sure you're 18 and over, please.

488
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:21,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the internet for boobs.

489
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I haven't seen any of that stuff yet, but yeah, that'd be kind of fun.

490
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,201
[SPEAKER_08]: No, neither have I. I'm just kidding.

491
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:27,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really want to see it.

492
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:30,502
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have a channel that's only that stuff.

493
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:31,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the Underground?

494
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:36,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah, something like the Red Light District or something.

495
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:37,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, you do get to classify yourself.

496
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:39,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Call the Green Door.

497
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you get to classify yourself, you know, under Xbox.

498
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:44,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, ooh, you're recreational, you're pro, you're Underground, right?

499
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:46,225
[SPEAKER_08]: They do need Red Light District.

500
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:50,466
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have never seen those categories actually dictate...

501
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:51,795
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

502
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:34,713
[SPEAKER_08]: One such person, Tom Taylor, T-Squared for short, is actually some 20-something-year-old professional gamer who has landed a $250,000 gaming contract in addition to running his brand new video game tutoring company.

503
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:36,555
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically...

504
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:47,853
[SPEAKER_08]: The Associated Press spoke with him about his earning six figures, and basically his response to the whole thing was, he takes risks.

505
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:49,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I take risks.

506
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,255
[SPEAKER_08]: In order to get paid, you have to take risks.

507
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:58,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I took the biggest risk I could take dropping out of school to play video games, and it paid off.

508
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:03,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess some people are just born with talent in certain things, like Michael Jordan was born to play basketball.

509
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel I was born to play video games.

510
00:40:08,477 --> 00:40:10,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a really great role model.

511
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Drop out of school so you can play video games professionally.

512
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to see this guy.

513
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I suggest all the gaming companies out there pick up this guy as your spokesperson.

514
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:25,822
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the perfect role model you want for your customers.

515
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Drop out of school because you know what?

516
00:40:29,003 --> 00:40:31,384
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy some games on a minimum wage job.

517
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:31,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

518
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to hire me.

519
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:36,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished school.

520
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:38,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an educated gamer.

521
00:40:38,932 --> 00:40:51,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to tear into this guy, but I can't help but think that would be a little bit hypocritical when I think back to college and all the class I missed due to Final Fantasy VII.

522
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to skip class to watch Sailor Moon.

523
00:40:55,236 --> 00:41:00,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's nothing wrong in the fact that playing video games for a profession... I mean, granted, that's pretty risky.

524
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:01,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because...

525
00:41:02,074 --> 00:41:03,096
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

526
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a difference, too, between high school dropout and college dropout.

527
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,114
[SPEAKER_08]: College dropout, that's fine.

528
00:41:25,174 --> 00:41:39,245
[SPEAKER_08]: In this society, there's an expectation, you know, well, certainly, I mean, again, I guess it depends on which part of the country you're in, but, you know, there's a real pressure out there to really, you've got to graduate high school if you want to move up in the corporate world.

529
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:45,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, there are jobs available, and I don't know, because it's like there's exceptions to every rule, but I just feel like

530
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:48,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackboy says, wait, how many pop stars never went to college?

531
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:24,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have no problem with people not going to college because, you know what, personally, I didn't go to college and I don't think I really missed anything because there are actually a lot of people that will start up their own businesses and stuff and they're very successful without going to college.

532
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:31,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, college does help with certain jobs and stuff like that, but it's not necessary if you've already got the smarts to kind of do it.

533
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,681
[SPEAKER_08]: You can pretty much start up a company and be successful without it.

534
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:35,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I dropped out of college.

535
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:39,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not exactly proud of it, but at the time, it's what I had to do and I don't regret it.

536
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually been in college off and on now for about 10 years.

537
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:48,394
[SPEAKER_08]: But see, though, high school is important.

538
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:50,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you should be finishing high school.

539
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because... Or at least test out of it.

540
00:42:52,775 --> 00:42:53,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

541
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:55,777
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be doing better education in high school, though.

542
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:58,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, okay, I mean, I don't know.

543
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:04,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a really big problem with someone like this being, you know, kind of a sponsor.

544
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:08,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, all we need this guy is to actually start playing good and winning stuff.

545
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:09,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, we'll have him, you know,

546
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I got really good by not going to high school.

547
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's excellent.

548
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,422
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, kids, be cool.

549
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay in school.

550
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:19,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

551
00:43:20,443 --> 00:43:21,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Other comments from our chat room here.

552
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:26,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Funnydale says, this guy is going to be working at Burger King in five years, cleaning out the fat fryer.

553
00:43:28,487 --> 00:43:33,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun says, I could see him getting a right thumb injury and being out for a season and going broke.

554
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:36,791
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's true.

555
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,772
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you have to fall back on if you get carpal tunnel?

556
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:42,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You're screwed, young man.

557
00:43:42,215 --> 00:43:45,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to have that Atari controller that used your eyebrows.

558
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:49,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Or hopefully in the future we'll be controlling games with our brains.

559
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:57,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of brains and certain people who remain unnamed on this radio show not using them!

560
00:43:58,799 --> 00:43:59,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

561
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:08,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've all been paying attention to the fact that Bully was pulled into court for being, you know, Violent Game, oh my god.

562
00:44:08,842 --> 00:44:10,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a new name for said...

563
00:44:11,772 --> 00:44:13,773
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Crack Frommson?

564
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I still like Jackie Poo.

565
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:16,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, whatever.

566
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:17,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Jackass.

567
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:29,820
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, the verdict that went down, though, with the ruling is basically the judge is not going to prohibit the sale of Bully.

568
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,883
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote, in the time that he played the game, the judge said he did not see anything so violent that would require the game to be held from being shipped.

569
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:42,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The Judge and Take-Two employee used a cheat code in order to skip around in the game.

570
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,843
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I understand, I think they played through the game for at least two hours.

571
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's plenty of time to get a good feel for the game.

572
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:57,593
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also saying that there wasn't anything different than what was seen on TV, really.

573
00:44:57,993 --> 00:45:00,235
[SPEAKER_08]: OMG, there's cheat codes to skip around in the game.

574
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:01,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

575
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:12,802
[SPEAKER_03]: But if anyone's curious about how everybody's not friend, the real bully of the industry reacted, he was told to sit down.

576
00:45:13,762 --> 00:45:16,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, weren't there like outbursts in the courtroom and that whole thing?

577
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:17,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I would have loved to have been there.

578
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:23,529
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that he had no business being there because he has, you cannot work...

579
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:28,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is legal advisor for something that you have an interest in.

580
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,461
[SPEAKER_08]: He did mention though that he hoped that people got injured after playing this game so he could go, I told you so.

581
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:39,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't he like sneak a slingshot into the courtroom to make some type of point about this is what people are going to do?

582
00:45:39,182 --> 00:45:41,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

583
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:43,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're not really supposed to talk about it.

584
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:45,244
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Simpsons?

585
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:46,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Bart has a slingshot.

586
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:49,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see slingshot related deaths in the news.

587
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:51,086
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an idiot.

588
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:57,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be educated and still be stupid.

589
00:45:58,094 --> 00:45:59,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And this man is living proof.

590
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:00,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait.

591
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:07,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, the thing about him being involved in this case is actually, from what I understand, precedent to have him disbarred in that state.

592
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:08,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hope it happens.

593
00:46:08,763 --> 00:46:11,445
[SPEAKER_08]: RavensDolphin says, Dennis the Menace has a slingshot.

594
00:46:12,065 --> 00:46:14,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back to, like, 50s, you know, homely.

595
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:15,288
[SPEAKER_03]: 40s, I think.

596
00:46:15,328 --> 00:46:15,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it?

597
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:18,490
[SPEAKER_03]: 40s, yeah.

598
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,252
[SPEAKER_08]: They were on Nickelodeon when I was a kid, so...

599
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's human nature.

600
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:30,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to remember which philosopher said this, but the nature of man is nasty, brutish, and short.

601
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are prone to violence.

602
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:35,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's written into our freaking DNA.

603
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:39,204
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, no one talks about the dangers of cup stacking either.

604
00:46:40,585 --> 00:46:43,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, Jack Thompson... Oh, I said it.

605
00:46:44,545 --> 00:46:45,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I gotta go kill myself.

606
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

607
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:49,580
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

608
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:18,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that set the precedent that Walmart ought to be pulling copies of Kill Bill off the shelves and Pulp Fiction and other violent train spotting and other really violent movies?

609
00:47:19,317 --> 00:47:20,378
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a double standard.

610
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:23,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, maybe Jack Thompson would like that.

611
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:23,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

612
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it too.

613
00:47:25,702 --> 00:47:26,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Spank, spank, spank.

614
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they should change it to Bible Mart.

615
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, it's still a very nasty double standard that we're seeing in the overall entertainment industry today.

616
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:37,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, video games is the current scapegoat.

617
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:39,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's how it is.

618
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It was music in the 80s and early 90s.

619
00:47:42,663 --> 00:47:50,771
[SPEAKER_03]: It's evolved on to, you know, it was, back in the days, it was, you know, we can't watch this TV show because it's so risque.

620
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:52,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And they attack in the middle.

621
00:47:52,472 --> 00:47:55,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, Mr. and Mrs. Brady share a bed.

622
00:47:55,055 --> 00:47:55,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knew?

623
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:56,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

624
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:57,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Elvis.

625
00:47:57,857 --> 00:47:58,817
[SPEAKER_08]: and his hip thrusting.

626
00:47:59,337 --> 00:47:59,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no.

627
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, people would go on, what was that example, on the Ed Sullivan show and ask him to change lyrics.

628
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Women are going to look at that and get impregnated immediately.

629
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:19,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even now with the whole, you know, not having, you know, available women's, you know, health care because we're going to decide to take over the world, you know, and fuck everybody.

630
00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:20,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

631
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:23,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Flaming Bozo in our chatroom says, why doesn't he go to porn?

632
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:25,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Why doesn't he fight porn?

633
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,289
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, they don't sell porn at Walmart.

634
00:48:27,549 --> 00:48:30,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody knows Jackie Poo shops at Walmart.

635
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they sell Skinamax type movies there, but anyway.

636
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:41,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that the whole reason he's so retentive is that he's just not getting laid.

637
00:48:44,275 --> 00:48:44,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

638
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:46,056
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

639
00:48:46,296 --> 00:48:47,236
[SPEAKER_08]: No one would.

640
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:51,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Stories about our dear friend, Mr.

641
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:55,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Get us a little bit angry.

642
00:48:55,055 --> 00:49:00,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but I get so frustrated whenever I read about what this clown's up to next.

643
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:03,560
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me just want to rant a little bit.

644
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't it make you want to rant a little bit?

645
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:05,821
[SPEAKER_08]: A little.

646
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's time to bring on the trumpets and the symphonies to declare it be the FUs of the Week!

647
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:23,285
[SPEAKER_03]: My F.U.

648
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:28,506
[SPEAKER_03]: of the week goes towards the stupid evil sinus infection from hell.

649
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:40,830
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who wasn't listening last year, I was sick for about two months with a weird combination of bronchitis and pneumonia because of the sinus infection.

650
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:47,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a sinus infection again, and it's starting off exactly the same way that my last one did.

651
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:53,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they're pumping me full of antibiotics and all kinds of anti-allergy drugs and all kinds of crap.

652
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:56,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me feel absolutely loony and also lose my voice.

653
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:59,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I wake up in the morning and have no voice.

654
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:00,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

655
00:50:00,493 --> 00:50:04,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love to talk, I guess, since I'm on a radio show and all that.

656
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not always sick.

657
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:09,258
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Fireboma, too.

658
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:10,659
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

659
00:50:11,497 --> 00:50:13,398
[SPEAKER_03]: A few to the sinus infection.

660
00:50:13,598 --> 00:50:16,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, the advice nurse was so funny.

661
00:50:16,259 --> 00:50:19,860
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, now, you've got chronic fatigue syndrome.

662
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,781
[SPEAKER_03]: It says here on your things you're going to get really tired.

663
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:25,101
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit, lady.

664
00:50:27,342 --> 00:50:34,544
[SPEAKER_03]: But to their credit, the Kaiser folks were really nice to me and gave me my choice of antibiotics.

665
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:37,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hate it.

666
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:40,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You sound like I've been drinking whiskey all night.

667
00:50:41,229 --> 00:50:47,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome was an inclination to wearing camo, but, you know, I guess I'm wrong.

668
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:51,357
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is wearing camo and, you know, smoking the chronic.

669
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:53,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

670
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:04,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, F you to the Indian Casino that we went to last night because, you know, like most Indian... Actually, this Indian Casino seems to be the worst one.

671
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:06,128
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Thunder Valley over here.

672
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's in Rockland or something, whatever, in California.

673
00:51:10,621 --> 00:51:14,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, they want to rape you for your money.

674
00:51:15,023 --> 00:51:19,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like America did to the Indians way back when.

675
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:24,767
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, I did leave there the only losing 50 cents, so that's really good.

676
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:31,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and by the way, for Rob, F you the fact that they do not have coconut shrimp.

677
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:38,313
[SPEAKER_08]: My F you of the week goes to commuting.

678
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm giving the FU to driving this week.

679
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:41,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Who would have thought?

680
00:51:42,074 --> 00:51:46,376
[SPEAKER_08]: No, my FU goes to commuting and long commutes and they make me frumpy and sad.

681
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:47,336
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

682
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:47,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Mikotov.

683
00:51:50,298 --> 00:52:00,844
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making a crappy Xbox 360 controller and ruining a brilliant game like Luminous because you guys can't make a D-pad.

684
00:52:03,906 --> 00:52:06,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's going to do it for this week's Dose of Angst.

685
00:52:07,108 --> 00:52:11,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It works so much better to play Luminous on PSP.

686
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to use the analog stick on the 360, and I'll tell you, that's not really fun at all.

687
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:15,756
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

688
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:34,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of Sony controllers, there's a new one coming out for the PlayStation 3, which was shown at Digital Life, which happened in New York City this weekend.

689
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:36,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure some of our listeners, I know some of them were there.

690
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:41,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we'll get some calls in the Skype line a little later from the show from our folks who are at Digital Life.

691
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:49,237
[SPEAKER_08]: But there were some awards handed out at Digital Life, and I'm assuming this was Digital Life and Ziff Davis that handed out these awards.

692
00:52:49,257 --> 00:52:51,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea how they picked them.

693
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,377
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

694
00:53:11,306 --> 00:53:12,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait, they do!

695
00:53:12,227 --> 00:53:15,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but to be fair, they have one for Xbox 360 as well, right?

696
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:17,452
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they have computer and video game.

697
00:53:17,472 --> 00:53:17,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

698
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:19,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a shit, okay?

699
00:53:19,394 --> 00:53:32,388
[SPEAKER_08]: The point is, is that, you know, they got this award or whatever, so it seems like, in some folks' mind, maybe things are coming around for Sony, and maybe now Sony is starting to put out the... It's hard for me to say.

700
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:34,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play PlayStation 3 at Digital

701
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:42,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be relying on the listeners who call in later in the show to tell us if the PlayStation 3 at Digital Life was deserving of this award.

702
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:43,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I can just see it now.

703
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:45,955
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why the PlayStation 3 is awesome?

704
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:47,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it smells like money!

705
00:53:50,337 --> 00:53:51,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow I doubt that's it.

706
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:53,919
[SPEAKER_08]: What if they had really good games on display there?

707
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:55,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you don't know.

708
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:55,980
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't there.

709
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I saw the list of games and probably not.

710
00:54:01,345 --> 00:54:02,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever, you know.

711
00:54:02,226 --> 00:54:02,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, great.

712
00:54:03,066 --> 00:54:04,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone wants to spend $600 for the system.

713
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,088
[SPEAKER_08]: More power to you.

714
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:07,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Go pre-order it at EB.

715
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:07,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait.

716
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:08,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't do that.

717
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:15,214
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt says, Sky, they gave out Japanese whores and HD TVs.

718
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:18,476
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Kipples and Bits says, I went to Digital Life.

719
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:20,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea how the PS3 won during that show.

720
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:22,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

721
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaded2006 says, Just keep thinking that Sony is going to make a turnaround.

722
00:54:30,323 --> 00:54:30,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

723
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:32,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

724
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:34,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, some other awards won at the show.

725
00:54:34,788 --> 00:54:36,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Gaming Hardware, PlayStation 3.

726
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Gaming Software, Final Fantasy XII.

727
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:49,398
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you that have to shop for kids this holiday season, the best gift for kids was the Fisher-Price Spark Art Easel.

728
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:50,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that like a Light Bright?

729
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:50,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

730
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss Light Bright.

731
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:54,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Booth also went to Sony.

732
00:54:55,343 --> 00:54:57,064
[SPEAKER_08]: But the hippest booth...

733
00:54:57,722 --> 00:54:58,682
[SPEAKER_08]: went to Napster.

734
00:54:59,022 --> 00:54:59,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember them?

735
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:00,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Napster?

736
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:02,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey kids, remember Napster?

737
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:06,244
[SPEAKER_03]: There had to have been recreational pharmaceuticals involved in that show.

738
00:55:07,644 --> 00:55:09,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I can neither confirm nor deny those statements again.

739
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:11,325
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hear from the listeners a little later in the show.

740
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:13,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they're already trying to hammer the Skype line to get in.

741
00:55:14,446 --> 00:55:14,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

742
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:19,127
[SPEAKER_08]: And SSJ100 Matt is putting out a call.

743
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:20,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's our listener Graywolf?

744
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:22,328
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the guy in the forums that...

745
00:55:23,078 --> 00:55:24,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Unapologetic in a Sony fandom.

746
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:28,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Who apparently writes in poetic prose form.

747
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:29,301
[SPEAKER_08]: They're fun to read.

748
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:30,242
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

749
00:55:30,902 --> 00:55:34,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage the opposing viewpoint to the masses.

750
00:55:34,384 --> 00:55:37,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I encourage the opposing viewpoint as long as it's educated.

751
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:42,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm all for a little bit of friendly debate as long as it doesn't resort to name-calling.

752
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:51,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony is apparently pretty happy after this week's pre-order fest at GameStop and EB.

753
00:55:52,294 --> 00:55:56,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, in case you didn't hear, they sold out of all the systems that the stores got.

754
00:55:57,018 --> 00:56:00,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not hard to sell out when you're only reserving 8 systems at a store.

755
00:56:00,801 --> 00:56:06,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, now, now, 8 was, you know, a larger number.

756
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:07,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Some stores only got like 4, I think.

757
00:56:07,986 --> 00:56:10,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, some had 16, to be fair, but still.

758
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:10,728
[SPEAKER_08]: 8 to 16, whatever.

759
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:17,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so that's somewhere between 28,000 to about 58,000 systems.

760
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:19,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

761
00:56:20,275 --> 00:56:28,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, according to the Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson, Dave Cracker... Yeah, that's Cracker, alright.

762
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:29,622
[SPEAKER_08]: His name's Cracker?

763
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:32,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Cracker, or Craker, or whatever.

764
00:56:32,324 --> 00:56:33,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen up, Cracker!

765
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:36,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, sorry, it had to be said.

766
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:39,569
[SPEAKER_08]: It was within minutes, because, you know, obviously...

767
00:56:40,336 --> 00:56:42,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, because you had the line going.

768
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:49,823
[SPEAKER_08]: It reconfirms the excitement and anticipation that we've known since the very first discussion of PlayStation 3.

769
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:55,347
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just pleased to see that the reaction from the consumer is as strong as we anticipated it would be.

770
00:56:55,848 --> 00:56:58,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It helps validate everything that we've been seeing up to this point.

771
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:05,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I released a system with only one unit in the United States, we'd be like, we sold everything in one second.

772
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:07,558
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome!

773
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:13,460
[SPEAKER_03]: My rebuttal to Sony is, everyone just go read VG Cats, look at the last comic.

774
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It perfectly illustrates it.

775
00:57:15,781 --> 00:57:16,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

776
00:57:17,061 --> 00:57:22,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we'll be covering this a little bit later on, but I don't think a lot of those people were keeping those systems.

777
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:24,624
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like, hey, you know what?

778
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:29,045
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox 360 was being able to be sold for twice retail on eBay.

779
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:30,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

780
00:57:30,845 --> 00:57:33,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what, because I've got a PlayStation 3 pre-ordered.

781
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:35,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, traitor.

782
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:35,867
[SPEAKER_03]: My

783
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,186
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're just a gaming whore.

784
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:04,170
[SPEAKER_03]: The DarkSakura Autographed Edition PS3.

785
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:08,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, also, I mean, of course, the Wii did also sell out as well.

786
00:58:10,174 --> 00:58:11,215
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop, and EB.

787
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:16,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe each store was getting upwards to 32 systems.

788
00:58:17,218 --> 00:58:20,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it ended up being about twice what they were getting with the PlayStation 3.

789
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:30,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, to give the pro-Sony side of this a little bit, I would believe there are 50,000 people in this country that excited about the PlayStation 3.

790
00:58:30,904 --> 00:58:33,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for tech junkies, it is a Blu-ray player.

791
00:58:34,686 --> 00:58:35,507
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cheap.

792
00:58:35,607 --> 00:58:36,808
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty exciting.

793
00:58:38,149 --> 00:58:40,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I would believe that there's that many fanboys.

794
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there's any.

795
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:51,738
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to go, ooh, it's this ravaging success when you consider there's really only eight PlayStation 3s at the store to be reserved.

796
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

797
00:58:52,158 --> 00:58:54,780
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see a little more towards November 17th.

798
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,002
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, like I've always been saying, is launch really that important?

799
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:02,365
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 2 didn't wow me at launch, but it really won me over about a year later.

800
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:03,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

801
00:59:03,891 --> 00:59:06,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe by a year later they will have actual systems in the stores.

802
00:59:07,272 --> 00:59:07,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

803
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:11,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to ask Mikotov really quick while he's still here because he's going to be leaving in a little bit.

804
00:59:12,034 --> 00:59:15,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to ask you, you actually camped out for the Wii pre-order, right?

805
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:16,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally did.

806
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:17,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about that experience.

807
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:17,596
[SPEAKER_08]: How did that go?

808
00:59:17,656 --> 00:59:18,417
[SPEAKER_08]: What time did you get there?

809
00:59:18,637 --> 00:59:19,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Who else was there?

810
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:24,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So me and my roommate decided we were going to go do the Wii pre-order because we really, really want that system after playing it.

811
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:28,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Because unlike some folks, I actually have to report to work at 8 o'clock in the morning.

812
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:30,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whatever.

813
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:31,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go whenever I want.

814
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:37,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we got up about 3.45 a.m.

815
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,392
[SPEAKER_04]: to go to our local GameStop.

816
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:44,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And he went a little bit earlier than I did, but I arrived about a little past 5.

817
00:59:45,413 --> 00:59:50,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were already 16 people ahead of me, which was insane to me.

818
00:59:50,894 --> 00:59:55,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I didn't think people were as stupid as I am.

819
00:59:55,655 --> 00:59:56,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, this is the Bay Area.

820
00:59:56,836 --> 00:59:57,976
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, you know, tech home.

821
00:59:58,176 --> 00:59:58,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.

822
00:59:59,316 --> 01:00:01,717
[SPEAKER_04]: But I live in the sunset, which is like dead, so...

823
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still shocking to me.

824
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:08,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, more people started showing up.

825
01:00:08,963 --> 01:00:14,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And around, I would say about maybe six, we had a good 30 people in line to help pass the time.

826
01:00:14,885 --> 01:00:16,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I played clubhouse games, which is okay.

827
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:21,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd say about 9.30, we had a little over 70 people in line.

828
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:24,504
[SPEAKER_04]: What's great about that is that the store opens at 10.

829
01:00:24,684 --> 01:00:41,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So at about 9.30, 9.40, an employee came out and those people who had been there since I would say about 7 or 8, the people that were towards the back, they got told that they would not be pre-ordering any systems today because they only got 32 in.

830
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:49,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought it was kind of jerky that the employees waited that long to come out and tell the people in the back of the line that they weren't going to get anything.

831
01:00:49,696 --> 01:00:51,717
[SPEAKER_08]: To their credit, though, corporate probably didn't tell them until then.

832
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:54,531
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably didn't get an email until overnight or something.

833
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:55,211
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true.

834
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:56,192
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true.

835
01:00:56,212 --> 01:00:59,654
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew a few days in advance.

836
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Poopy!

837
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:01,796
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just jerks.

838
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:07,540
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so they let us in two at a time to pre-order our systems, and it went pretty smooth.

839
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:15,846
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave out a list of stuff we could pre-order with the system while we were standing in line, put the $50 down, and then we were on our way.

840
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:16,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really...

841
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:19,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

842
01:01:35,285 --> 01:01:37,046
[SPEAKER_08]: What types of people did you see in line?

843
01:01:37,086 --> 01:01:40,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it all gaming nerds like you, or did you have the older parents?

844
01:01:40,108 --> 01:01:40,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a gaming nerd.

845
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:42,769
[SPEAKER_08]: You are, but that's beside the point.

846
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Were there any older people in the line?

847
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:48,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Were there excited girls from college?

848
01:01:48,993 --> 01:01:50,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw maybe three girls.

849
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:58,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the front of the line comprised of scrawny white guys and Asian guys.

850
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:04,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the back of the line were the older parents that maybe...

851
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:12,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't think that pre-ordering the Wii is all that big of a deal just because Nintendo loves us and you know they're making lots of them

852
01:02:34,204 --> 01:02:35,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted the security.

853
01:02:35,925 --> 01:02:40,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I kind of plan on maybe camping for the PS3.

854
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:46,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I didn't want to try to get too... Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.

855
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,791
[SPEAKER_04]: eBay, eBay, eBay.

856
01:02:50,732 --> 01:02:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was that.

857
01:02:51,593 --> 01:02:52,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, thanks for sharing your story.

858
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:53,654
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it.

859
01:02:53,934 --> 01:02:54,754
[SPEAKER_08]: That was very nice of you.

860
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:56,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

861
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,336
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some more?

862
01:02:58,356 --> 01:03:00,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to say on PS3 pre-orders?

863
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:03,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean...

864
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:08,432
[SPEAKER_08]: There are going to be more pre-orders, I'm sure, around the world.

865
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:12,695
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing is, it's going to be very hard to come by.

866
01:03:14,296 --> 01:03:15,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Just very, very hard.

867
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:19,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are looking to get one, try to get it as soon as possible.

868
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it is going to be like the Xbox 360 was last year.

869
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:27,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And you might end up having to buy it on eBay if you really want it day one.

870
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:30,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, I would wait.

871
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:37,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it were me, I would wait just because a lot of launch games you may be looking forward to are delayed until next year.

872
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:42,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, kind of keep that in mind when you're thinking about pre-ordering it.

873
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:43,903
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

874
01:03:44,543 --> 01:03:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go on to some more gaming news.

875
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:58,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of back to the whole Sony camp, there is actually one thing that I am personally excited about coming out on PSP, and that's After Burner.

876
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:08,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega did confirm they have a deal with Planet Moon Studios to do a PSP version, a new one, of Afterburner.

877
01:04:09,089 --> 01:04:12,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anyone who was into the original, hey.

878
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:15,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a quote actually from the CEO of Planet Moon.

879
01:04:16,415 --> 01:04:22,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Most importantly, it's approximately 9,000% more portable than the original arcade cabinet.

880
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:25,142
[SPEAKER_03]: That just struck me as a stupid quote.

881
01:04:25,785 --> 01:04:29,526
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, it's going to be called Afterburner Black Falcon.

882
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:35,909
[SPEAKER_03]: It will have 19 officially licensed customizable planes, a single player modem, and Wi-Fi multiplayer.

883
01:04:36,729 --> 01:04:38,129
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're slated for spring 2007.

884
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:44,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to mention we also mentioned that back on episode 200.

885
01:04:45,492 --> 01:04:47,513
[SPEAKER_09]: That was also one of the big stories we came out with.

886
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:49,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I see one of those under the radar things.

887
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:49,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

888
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:51,194
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well.

889
01:04:52,273 --> 01:04:53,113
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been confirmed.

890
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:54,154
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not a liar, Loki.

891
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:54,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Way to go.

892
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:55,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

893
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:58,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Full Auto 2 on PSP, March 14th, 2007.

894
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:00,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Heard it here first.

895
01:05:00,516 --> 01:05:04,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if that's the one that doesn't happen, I'm going to laugh my ass off just to share.

896
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:06,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

897
01:05:06,158 --> 01:05:12,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Sony things, Eurogamer got a really in-depth look at PlayStation 3, the interface and the online.

898
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:13,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.

899
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,481
[SPEAKER_08]: They got a pretty in-depth article over at Eurogamer.net.

900
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:21,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the highlights from their tour, of course, the PlayStation 3 is going to be using what's called the Cross Media Bar.

901
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:31,961
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you've played the PSP at all, you're already familiar with how the PS3 is going to be set up, which is kind of interesting that they have that very similar layout between the two.

902
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:34,703
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of makes me wonder if the Wii and DS are going to be similar like that too.

903
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:35,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

904
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:42,048
[SPEAKER_08]: They talk about how you're going to have web browsing on the PlayStation 3, something that the Xbox 360 does not have currently.

905
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:44,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it will have better flash support.

906
01:05:44,804 --> 01:05:46,424
[SPEAKER_08]: and Streaming Media Support.

907
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:48,745
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the cell processor.

908
01:05:48,765 --> 01:05:51,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I would imagine it can run this stuff.

909
01:05:51,706 --> 01:05:54,726
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the friends bar and there's different icons there.

910
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:57,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Your signed in friends show their own icons on the bar there.

911
01:05:58,727 --> 01:06:02,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Other icons would be those that are managing the PlayStation Network account.

912
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:06,689
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a master account and associated accounts.

913
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:09,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming that's for a family setup there.

914
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:13,851
[SPEAKER_08]: You could also, with the master account, limit what your kids do on their accounts and how much they can spend

915
01:06:14,198 --> 01:06:17,461
[SPEAKER_08]: on the PlayStation Store, which is another section of the bar.

916
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:22,584
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, we all know SingStar is going to be huge on the PlayStation Store right out the gate.

917
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:28,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to check out more on the tour of online and what to expect there, check it out at Eurogamer.net.

918
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:36,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what's funny is the Sony Store that they're going to have on there, no point system like the Microsoft and Nintendo teams are doing.

919
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:40,258
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just going to be dollars or your currency.

920
01:06:40,738 --> 01:06:42,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of interesting, I thought.

921
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

922
01:06:43,973 --> 01:06:48,554
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a comment from Mike in the chatroom, Loki is the only one that likes Full Auto.

923
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:52,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe that's true, maybe that's why nobody else has been reporting on it, because you're the only person that likes Full Auto.

924
01:06:54,116 --> 01:06:56,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I didn't care for Afterburner.

925
01:06:57,576 --> 01:06:58,857
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I still reported on it.

926
01:06:59,497 --> 01:07:03,438
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, Oblivion, it was a great game, but eh, it's so.

927
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:05,019
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

928
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:34,214
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that was kind of interesting, and we talked about it a little bit before about Sony and the rumor that X-Fire is going to be teaming up with them for some online partnership and stuff.

929
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:38,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sony came out and said, no, no, no, that's not true, that's only for one game.

930
01:07:38,277 --> 01:07:39,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, it is true.

931
01:07:39,738 --> 01:07:42,099
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually is going to be happening, and it was officially announced.

932
01:07:42,419 --> 01:07:51,785
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be using the middleware, or they're going to be kind of teaming up for a middleware solution that's going to be an add-on to the current...

933
01:07:52,213 --> 01:07:52,413
[SPEAKER_09]: X-Fire

934
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually, I really like X-Fire.

935
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a pretty nice little app.

936
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:23,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if MTV does own it, I really like it.

937
01:08:23,435 --> 01:08:24,476
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cool little application.

938
01:08:24,596 --> 01:08:26,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that should be interesting.

939
01:08:26,097 --> 01:08:29,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be some brownie points for the PlayStation 3 as far as I'm concerned.

940
01:08:29,935 --> 01:08:32,496
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to need as many brownie points as it can get.

941
01:08:33,096 --> 01:08:39,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the delay circumstances, there's actually a rumor that came out.

942
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:50,520
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the Spanish gaming sites called Maristation said that Kutaragi warned there would be a shortage of PS3 stock in Japan and North America and that Europe would have to wait even longer than they already are.

943
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:56,241
[SPEAKER_03]: But a Sony spokesperson has said that that was categorically not true.

944
01:08:57,202 --> 01:08:58,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how they always...

945
01:08:58,942 --> 01:09:01,083
[SPEAKER_09]: He was eating grams at the time.

946
01:09:01,123 --> 01:09:01,623
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

947
01:09:01,703 --> 01:09:02,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

948
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:06,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see, it said that he hasn't done any media briefings since the Tokyo Game Show.

949
01:09:07,145 --> 01:09:15,569
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because they had him, you know, chained to his jungle gym in his house so that he wouldn't go run out into traffic and die because they need him.

950
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,451
[SPEAKER_09]: To spread weird rumors.

951
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:27,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at any rate, Sony's actually planning on shipping 6 million PS3 units on a global scale by...

952
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:29,765
[SPEAKER_03]: The end of the 2007 fiscal year.

953
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:31,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

954
01:09:32,887 --> 01:09:33,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

955
01:09:33,447 --> 01:09:35,648
[SPEAKER_03]: They can plan it, whether it happens or not, hey.

956
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:38,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think there will be further delays?

957
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite all this?

958
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:41,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't doubt it.

959
01:09:42,152 --> 01:09:43,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly if they run into hardware problems.

960
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:47,595
[SPEAKER_09]: If they run into the overheating problems or anything like that.

961
01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:49,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that they didn't foresee.

962
01:09:50,116 --> 01:09:53,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they actually, you remember all those issues they had with the first model PlayStation 2s.

963
01:09:54,118 --> 01:09:56,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, amazingly enough, I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2.

964
01:09:57,765 --> 01:10:01,567
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've had it for years and it hasn't had any problems.

965
01:10:02,247 --> 01:10:08,210
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of them were having issues with coming off track, overheating.

966
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing there actually being lots of issues for the PS3.

967
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:13,692
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

968
01:10:14,635 --> 01:10:15,856
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

969
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:41,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Cyro Interactive Very anime-ish looking game, but it's an adventure type game.

970
01:10:41,645 --> 01:10:43,266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also coming in a limited edition.

971
01:10:43,946 --> 01:10:45,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's Tennis, also coming out.

972
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:47,268
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Korean version, actually.

973
01:10:47,308 --> 01:10:48,969
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out on October 19th.

974
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Sudoku Master on the PlayStation 2.

975
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:56,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Should also be noted that various Wild Arms games are coming out in Sony's version of the Best Hits.

976
01:10:57,714 --> 01:11:01,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can get that cheaper through your importer if you are looking for games such as that.

977
01:11:02,877 --> 01:11:03,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming out on the DS...

978
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:10,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, several games in the Kodomo no Tami no Yomi Kikasi series are coming out.

979
01:11:11,594 --> 01:11:13,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I'm not sure what type of games those are.

980
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:13,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Children's something.

981
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:15,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, some type of children's game there.

982
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:16,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a miscellaneous.

983
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:17,838
[SPEAKER_08]: It's by Starfish.

984
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:19,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Creates this games.

985
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:20,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Creates these, so.

986
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Several games in that series.

987
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,520
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome.

988
01:11:24,521 --> 01:11:24,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh.

989
01:11:24,641 --> 01:11:27,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if I understood any of what I just said, yeah, it would be pretty awesome.

990
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:30,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyways.

991
01:11:30,884 --> 01:11:30,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

992
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:32,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the U.S.

993
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:34,836
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to be getting quite a bit of stuff as well.

994
01:11:35,176 --> 01:11:38,297
[SPEAKER_09]: This week is a very good week for games, so lots of good stuff.

995
01:11:38,477 --> 01:11:45,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Including, of course, Bully, the game that's been getting so much controversy lately on PlayStation 2.

996
01:11:46,339 --> 01:11:50,220
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception on the PSP.

997
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,900
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get your flight sim on there.

998
01:11:52,661 --> 01:11:58,242
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're looking to get your flight sim on on the PC, Microsoft Flight Simulator X is going to be coming out.

999
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:05,993
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as Contact on the DS, Destroy All Humans 2 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

1000
01:12:06,033 --> 01:12:08,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first one was really fun, so I'm looking forward to playing this one.

1001
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:12,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Family Guy on PlayStation 2, PSP, and Xbox.

1002
01:12:13,138 --> 01:12:14,299
[SPEAKER_09]: That one actually looks pretty good.

1003
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:19,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of thought that was going to be a crappy, like, kind of a port of a TV show, but it looks pretty good.

1004
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:22,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendogs, Dalmatian and Friends.

1005
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:23,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Why...

1006
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:25,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Why this late in the game?

1007
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:27,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people still like the puppies.

1008
01:12:27,122 --> 01:12:29,764
[SPEAKER_08]: For those that were too lazy to unlock the Dalmatian in the first one.

1009
01:12:30,465 --> 01:12:31,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Not lazy, just had to find the hat.

1010
01:12:33,526 --> 01:12:41,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on the 360, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also on the 360.

1011
01:12:41,832 --> 01:12:51,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Sims 2 Pets will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and DS, as well as SpongeBob Creature from the Krusty Krab on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

1012
01:12:51,998 --> 01:12:52,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Yippee.

1013
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:59,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, on the PC, we have Battlefield 2142.

1014
01:13:00,832 --> 01:13:02,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is going to be coming out as well.

1015
01:13:03,234 --> 01:13:03,935
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

1016
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:07,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you just don't have time to go buy a game like that.

1017
01:13:07,857 --> 01:13:09,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are going to give one away.

1018
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,461
[SPEAKER_09]: And how might you be able to do this, to enter in?

1019
01:13:13,742 --> 01:13:14,682
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually pretty simple.

1020
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:22,228
[SPEAKER_09]: All you have to do, and this contest will be running until Wednesday, is go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash BF

1021
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:26,343
[SPEAKER_09]: and 2142 for Battlefield 2142.

1022
01:13:27,044 --> 01:13:35,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Just simply enter the contest there and there will be a random drawing on Wednesday and we'll be announcing it in Part A of Episode 205.

1023
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll be able to get that right away.

1024
01:13:37,811 --> 01:13:38,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they'll be able to get it right away.

1025
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:40,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a digital distribution thing.

1026
01:13:40,993 --> 01:13:45,376
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a digital download code so you'll be able to download it straight to your PC.

1027
01:13:46,136 --> 01:13:50,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So look forward to that and I look forward to giving a full review about the game next week.

1028
01:13:51,149 --> 01:13:52,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, doesn't Desperate Housewives come out this week?

1029
01:13:53,531 --> 01:13:57,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I noticed in our chat room, somebody had said they just saw a commercial on VH1.

1030
01:13:57,473 --> 01:13:57,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Who said that?

1031
01:13:57,954 --> 01:13:59,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was last week, to be honest.

1032
01:13:59,695 --> 01:14:00,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it?

1033
01:14:00,195 --> 01:14:00,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was.

1034
01:14:01,256 --> 01:14:04,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, JVmon says, a commercial for the Desperate Housewives video game just aired on VH1.

1035
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means someone's watching Flavor of Love.

1036
01:14:10,563 --> 01:14:11,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame, shame.

1037
01:14:12,196 --> 01:14:12,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug!

1038
01:14:12,496 --> 01:14:13,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug!

1039
01:14:13,337 --> 01:14:13,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug!

1040
01:14:43,356 --> 01:14:47,617
[SPEAKER_03]: King of Fighters, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, more stuff.

1041
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:50,238
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1042
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:51,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Down the line.

1043
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun, you folks over in Europe, playing your renamed version of Bully.

1044
01:14:58,661 --> 01:14:59,481
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up with that?

1045
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:00,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I still don't get that.

1046
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:04,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess Bully must have a real negative context overseas or something.

1047
01:15:04,843 --> 01:15:06,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Could someone please enlighten me from overseas?

1048
01:15:06,804 --> 01:15:07,764
[SPEAKER_08]: What's wrong with the word Bully?

1049
01:15:08,985 --> 01:15:09,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1050
01:15:10,025 --> 01:15:10,125
Hmm.

1051
01:15:11,752 --> 01:15:16,654
[SPEAKER_08]: This issue has been going back and forth and I'm getting to the point where I just don't care anymore.

1052
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you could call this a follow-up.

1053
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:24,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week we said something about how GameStop was tooting their horn that the Wii demo kiosks were going to be exclusive to their store.

1054
01:15:25,138 --> 01:15:25,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?

1055
01:15:26,278 --> 01:15:32,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo of America says, uh-uh, quote, playable Wii setups will be available at a variety of retail outlets.

1056
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:37,745
[SPEAKER_08]: We expect that anyone who wants to try Wii will be able to through multiple different methods.

1057
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:50,892
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to retail outlets, Wii will be playable at a number of mall tours throughout the company, the nationwide Nintendo Fusion Tour, and other grassroots consumer events, which means Loki was misinformed about this when he told us this

1058
01:15:51,553 --> 01:15:52,974
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop

1059
01:16:20,718 --> 01:16:21,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, whatever works.

1060
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:29,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the whole thing, you know, this is kind of, I know this is getting into another story, but maybe the whole thing has to do with interference from lighting.

1061
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:34,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe not being able to control that, and that might have something to do with it.

1062
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:35,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, whatever.

1063
01:16:37,012 --> 01:16:38,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was a bunch of BS, but whatever.

1064
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:39,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1065
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:39,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1066
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:42,096
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just speculation right now.

1067
01:16:42,785 --> 01:16:50,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, an interesting rumor has come out about the Wii console is that it might actually be running Linux already.

1068
01:16:50,747 --> 01:16:51,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha!

1069
01:16:53,268 --> 01:17:04,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those folks that love to install Linux on new things, whether it be, you know, the Nintendo DS, the PSP, a toaster, a Billy Bass, whatever the hell, you know.

1070
01:17:05,816 --> 01:17:06,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad, Nintendo beat you to it.

1071
01:17:06,996 --> 01:17:07,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

1072
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:19,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, a Nintendo insider who blogs under the internet moniker Kiyoshi Saruwatari That means something about monkey.

1073
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:25,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, claims that the Wii console will run an open source Linux OS.

1074
01:17:26,602 --> 01:17:28,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, that hasn't been confirmed.

1075
01:17:28,822 --> 01:17:34,964
[SPEAKER_09]: It's purely speculation right now, but it's basically used for the back end of

1076
01:17:36,205 --> 01:17:40,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Using the software for porting stuff in there like the Opera browser and stuff like that.

1077
01:17:41,168 --> 01:17:46,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says it will be closed and will only allow signed code.

1078
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:50,933
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, anyone that remembers that kind of stuff knows that people break that pretty quick.

1079
01:17:51,694 --> 01:17:51,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

1080
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:53,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Use it to break the region lock.

1081
01:17:53,695 --> 01:17:58,237
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first thing I want you Linux nerds to work on if this is indeed true and the Wii already has it on there.

1082
01:17:58,537 --> 01:18:01,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you to work on the region lock in case there's, you know...

1083
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:03,486
[SPEAKER_08]: OhAndDon for the Wii.

1084
01:18:03,586 --> 01:18:04,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I want that shit imported.

1085
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:06,068
[SPEAKER_08]: ASAP.

1086
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:06,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1087
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:12,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you imagine OhAndDon on the Wii?

1088
01:18:12,335 --> 01:18:14,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking about it and I'm wearing a warm smile.

1089
01:18:14,977 --> 01:18:17,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as far as other things that are... Oh, and hold on.

1090
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to... Sorry.

1091
01:18:19,522 --> 01:18:20,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hate having to read these.

1092
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Bad Transition.

1093
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:23,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Five points from Gryffindor.

1094
01:18:23,546 --> 01:18:23,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1095
01:18:24,688 --> 01:18:28,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on my way to a very wonderful transition.

1096
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:38,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And this will be the last story that we have from Kiyoshi Saruwati because apparently the whole thing was a practical joke made up by him to get spread around the world.

1097
01:18:38,911 --> 01:18:41,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So that will be next from the podcast.

1098
01:18:41,392 --> 01:18:42,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1099
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:44,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So you just made up the last five minutes.

1100
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, I'm keeping that in.

1101
01:18:46,413 --> 01:18:48,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I am reporting the news, okay?

1102
01:18:49,154 --> 01:18:52,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it was purely speculation and this is what this guy said.

1103
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:53,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all his fault, not mine.

1104
01:18:54,704 --> 01:18:55,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I just report the news.

1105
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:56,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's funny.

1106
01:18:56,506 --> 01:18:57,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't shoot the messenger.

1107
01:18:58,249 --> 01:18:59,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really freaking funny.

1108
01:19:00,592 --> 01:19:02,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's five minutes of my life I won't get back.

1109
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:05,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of things that I also think are funny is not really the story.

1110
01:19:07,739 --> 01:19:18,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has announced a launch of LiveMove, which is a development tool to make it easy to produce titles for the Wii easier and faster.

1111
01:19:19,452 --> 01:19:28,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made by, I guess that would be iLive, artificial intelligence specialists.

1112
01:19:30,347 --> 01:19:36,848
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, it's supposed to help allow a developer to train the Wii Remote just by performing motions.

1113
01:19:37,568 --> 01:19:48,210
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote on here from iLive's chairman, Wei Yan, LiveMove will allow the game industry to move away from indirect digital control to more natural analog control for the first time.

1114
01:19:49,991 --> 01:19:56,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Genyo Takeda, who's Nintendo's senior MD of Integrated Research and Development, said,

1115
01:19:57,828 --> 01:20:09,395
[SPEAKER_03]: basically, um, said, when Nintendo's development team saw a live move, we instantly recognized how easy it would greatly increase our ability to explore and experiment with new concepts and make our lives easier.

1116
01:20:10,315 --> 01:20:13,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm looking to see how, uh, what they can come up with that.

1117
01:20:13,497 --> 01:20:14,578
[SPEAKER_03]: They've made some, uh,

1118
01:20:15,569 --> 01:20:20,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Another quote on here, actually, that I think was really cool is, this revolutionary tool liberates the imaginations of game creators.

1119
01:20:20,792 --> 01:20:35,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think, actually, the whole concept of having something that you can use free motion to actually program with, I think really just links very well to the whole mission behind the Wii.

1120
01:20:35,981 --> 01:20:39,503
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have innovative games, but you have innovative development going with it.

1121
01:20:40,184 --> 01:20:40,364
All right.

1122
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:48,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe some developers that want to see what's coming up in Nintendo's world might want to check out the Nintendo Space World Show.

1123
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:50,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the Nintendo World Show for short.

1124
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:56,687
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be November 3rd in Nagoya and November 12th in Osaka.

1125
01:20:57,247 --> 01:21:00,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was from Nintendo's official Japan site.

1126
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:04,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So check it out if you're over in Japan and want to check out what Nintendo's up to.

1127
01:21:04,912 --> 01:21:06,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember, they don't do Tokyo Game Show.

1128
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:08,595
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is kind of their version of that.

1129
01:21:09,414 --> 01:21:10,314
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome.

1130
01:21:10,354 --> 01:21:13,315
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be, of course, hands-on Wii demos and new DS games.

1131
01:21:13,855 --> 01:21:14,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go.

1132
01:21:15,315 --> 01:21:17,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, well, start saving those pennies quick.

1133
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:25,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, some interesting stuff that they're doing with the GameCube version of Twilight Princess in Japan.

1134
01:21:25,418 --> 01:21:29,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only being offered online, kind of similar to what they do with Electroplankton over here.

1135
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:36,200
[SPEAKER_09]: The main reason Nintendo is doing this is to avoid both versions of the game in stores at the same time because of the Wii launch.

1136
01:21:36,755 --> 01:21:43,996
[SPEAKER_09]: They would much rather see the Wii Zelda sell than the GameCube version and that wouldn't be a guarantee if the two versions are on the same shelf.

1137
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:49,917
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no information on whether this same procedure will be passed on to Europe and the US as well.

1138
01:21:51,298 --> 01:21:51,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1139
01:21:52,698 --> 01:21:54,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see if they do that in the US as well.

1140
01:21:55,078 --> 01:21:55,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they will.

1141
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:59,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot more demand for the old GameCube games here.

1142
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:04,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of folks that buy the earlier generations of consoles because they're cheaper.

1143
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,939
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think they'll still be on shelves out here.

1144
01:22:07,959 --> 01:22:08,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1145
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:11,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some people might not want to use the Wii to play Zelda.

1146
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, wasn't there an old story that said you could plug in the old GameCube controller and use that on the Wii version still?

1147
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:18,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1148
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:18,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1149
01:22:19,922 --> 01:22:20,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's kind of funny.

1150
01:22:21,022 --> 01:22:24,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a discussion with Dan about this not too long ago.

1151
01:22:24,922 --> 01:22:29,503
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that he's actually thinking about just picking it up on GameCube anyway instead of on Wii.

1152
01:22:29,823 --> 01:22:31,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for the hell of it or just because of the controls?

1153
01:22:31,604 --> 01:22:32,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because the control...

1154
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:46,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of a few things changed from the E3 demo version that I wasn't too happy with, like not being able to use the remote actually for the sword at all, you have to slash.

1155
01:22:47,612 --> 01:22:47,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, weird.

1156
01:22:48,232 --> 01:22:49,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, I don't like that.

1157
01:22:49,853 --> 01:22:51,994
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're probably just getting it on GameCube.

1158
01:22:52,014 --> 01:22:53,255
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1159
01:22:55,056 --> 01:22:59,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, or you might just have both because you're a whore for Link like that, right?

1160
01:23:00,988 --> 01:23:01,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

1161
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:03,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play Wind Waker.

1162
01:23:04,473 --> 01:23:05,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I refuse to play Wind Waker.

1163
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:09,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a different... That's fake, cartoony Link.

1164
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:10,020
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the real deal.

1165
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:23,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well that is about going to wrap it up for our Part A, but you know, over the past few weeks, we have not been able to end Part A of Orange Lounge Radio until we get to some DDR previews, and that's what we're going to do right now.

1166
01:23:23,691 --> 01:23:29,153
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a look at some new tracks here from DDR Universe and DDR Ultramix 4.

1167
01:23:29,493 --> 01:23:33,534
[SPEAKER_08]: These are new Dance Dance Revolution games coming out from Konami a little bit later this year.

1168
01:23:33,854 --> 01:23:34,494
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1169
01:24:01,591 --> 01:24:02,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1170
01:24:27,507 --> 01:24:28,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We are connected.

1171
01:24:57,825 --> 01:24:59,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1172
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:33,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk with me through the universe.

1173
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:06,777
[SPEAKER_00]: and along the way, see how all of us are connected.

1174
01:26:06,937 --> 01:26:18,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Feast the eyes of your soul, on the love that abounds, in all places at once, seemingly endless, like your own existence in stillness.

1175
01:26:20,547 --> 01:26:23,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We are connected We are connected

1176
01:26:49,012 --> 01:26:50,013
Thank you for watching!

1177
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:27,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Music

1178
01:27:57,674 --> 01:28:01,496
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Jondi and Spech here on the DDR Sneak Peeks with We Are Connected.

1179
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,217
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be coming to DDR Universe.

1180
01:28:03,557 --> 01:28:05,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind that will be cut down a little bit, though.

1181
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:10,961
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the full version you heard, and DDR songs tend to be about a minute and a half to a minute and 45 in length.

1182
01:28:11,321 --> 01:28:12,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So check that out.

1183
01:28:12,382 --> 01:28:20,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And our old buddy, DJ Morpheus, who's in chat right now, the one and only from UndersedationLive.org, made it funny in the chat.

1184
01:28:20,246 --> 01:28:22,487
[SPEAKER_08]: He said Stephen Hawking is on vocals in that song.

1185
01:28:22,827 --> 01:28:24,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're crazy.

1186
01:28:24,955 --> 01:28:26,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyway, let's go to another song here.

1187
01:28:26,856 --> 01:28:29,738
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from DDR Ultramix 4.

1188
01:28:30,599 --> 01:28:34,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a song by Wave Group featuring Scotty D. And of course you know Wave Group.

1189
01:28:34,862 --> 01:28:37,324
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done some of those cover songs that were in Beatmania.

1190
01:28:37,644 --> 01:28:40,346
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've played other songs by them previously during this promotion.

1191
01:28:40,706 --> 01:28:42,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Well they have a song and it's a little bit jazzy.

1192
01:28:42,488 --> 01:28:44,069
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Stompin' at the Gotham.

1193
01:28:44,109 --> 01:28:48,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the next song we're going to play here on the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.

1194
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:49,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1195
01:29:25,123 --> 01:29:26,290
Thanks for watching!

1196
01:30:02,907 --> 01:30:03,757
Keep it going!

1197
01:30:27,628 --> 01:30:31,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop into the Gotham here on the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.

1198
01:30:31,213 --> 01:30:31,974
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a fun one.

1199
01:30:32,495 --> 01:30:33,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice big band sound to that.

1200
01:30:34,017 --> 01:30:34,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very fun.

1201
01:30:34,918 --> 01:30:35,579
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a fun one.

1202
01:30:35,599 --> 01:30:36,601
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be cool to play in DDR.

1203
01:30:37,426 --> 01:30:38,406

1208
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,605
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Zetsubou Tekida here on Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.

1209
01:35:01,511 --> 01:35:10,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here on Orange Lounge Radio by Nico Girard, that is Zetsubou Tekida, or at least I think that's how you pronounce it, but watch it be like some crazy thing where the Z is silent, I don't know.

1210
01:35:10,497 --> 01:35:20,204
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's coming to DDR Ultramix 4, and possibly Beatmania 2DX someday, I don't know, that's kind of how I think that song is, very 2DX-ish song.

1211
01:35:20,324 --> 01:35:22,466
[SPEAKER_03]: That song had no imagination whatsoever.

1212
01:35:22,746 --> 01:35:23,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1213
01:35:23,106 --> 01:35:23,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a fan of that song?

1214
01:35:25,088 --> 01:35:25,288
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1215
01:35:25,368 --> 01:35:25,528
