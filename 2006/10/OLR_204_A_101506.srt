00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,880
Today, October 15th, 2006, more details on the E3 Makeover, PlayStation 3 and Wii's are

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,120
pre-ordered around the nation, and what are the annoying things about the next game generation?

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,840
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,280
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,320
Radio.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,440
We are that internet radio program dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and the

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,420
We talk about all sorts of games.

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,300
We try to avoid those that suck but, you know, once in a while we've got to talk about games

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,760
that suck because we have to tell you to stay the hell away from them.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
And I'm here to help you do that.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
My name is Rob Roberts.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
You might know me as Sky.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
Hi.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Welcome back.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,000
I am back, aren't I?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,080
Yes, you were off at the Mouse House last week.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
For a day.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
I was actually, I came back for a funeral.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
Oh, that's right.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,320
That's right.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
You were, I remember now, so.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,520
And then I fell into a coma for eight hours because I have a sinus infection.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So sick Jamie's back.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,800
Those folks that have been listening to the podcast for a long time know that Jamie was

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,960
sick for a while.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,080
And it started from a sinus infection, so like my doctors all like, okay, pick your

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
antibiotic.

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm like, I get to choose?

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,480
So I'm on erythromycin, which hates my whole digestive system.

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,400
I prefer C-Pro, just five tablets, but that's just me.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,080
Anyway, sorry, we're not The Drug Show.

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
We're Orange Lounge Radio.

37
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Aren't we Loki?

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Tech Master Loki is also here.

39
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Yes.

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
Yes.

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
How you doing?

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Yes, we're not The Drug Show.

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I like your shirt.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,320
You have a me and my Katamari shirt on.

45
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Yes.

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
You know, I never played that on PSP.

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,440
I just kind of missed it.

48
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,400
Like I know I was looking forward to it and then I was kind of like, eh.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,160
I played it a little bit and got bored.

50
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Did you?

51
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Really quick.

52
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,380
Was it just not, it was not the same on the little screen?

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,620
The lack of a second analog stick cramps my hand up very badly.

54
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,880
And so it was just like kind of Metroid Prime Hunter Syndrome where, you know, you just

55
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,760
have to stop playing because it hurts your hand and it's just not, I don't know.

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,640
It's like trying to control a car with a brick or something instead of a steering wheel.

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
I don't know.

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,920
I actually got the urge to play Katamari Damacy yesterday.

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,000
I was lying on the couch kind of just, you know, having one of those lazy days where

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,640
I'm not going to move from this spot and then I'm looking over at my game collection which

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,040
is, you know, kind of next to the TV and then I'm like, I want to roll over things.

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,600
I want to play Katamari Damacy.

63
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
There's something very stress relieving about that game.

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I can't explain it.

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,840
We get that feeling every day during work.

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,400
That's why we have to have our killing breaks.

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I see.

68
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
Hence the Liberty City stories.

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Yes.

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,000
We'll be here Gaming Week in just a minute, but I do want to introduce an old favorite

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,840
of ours that's sitting here tonight on the ground hacking something on the computer over

72
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
there.

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Say hello to Miklotov.

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,640
It's called chatting online, not hacking.

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
What are you chatting on?

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
It's not our chat room.

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,000
No, it's just like instant messenger.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
So you're talking to people better than our listeners.

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Yeah, just some coworkers.

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Oh, okay.

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,960
Well, if you want to join our chat room, www.orangelauntrader.com, click on chat.

83
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,400
Miklotov will be here for a little bit, but you're not going to be here for the whole

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
show, right?

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,920
You have a train or a bus to catch or something?

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Yeah, something like that.

87
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
All right.

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,240
Don't say train.

89
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,120
What's wrong with trains?

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Because I told you what I've been listening to all week.

91
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,280
Oh, I'm going to be riding a train very soon, actually.

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
It's kind of...

93
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,720
If I hear any more Guns N' Roses, I'm going to shoot myself.

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,320
All right, well, I suppose we should start talking about the Gaming Weeks, starting off

95
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
with Dark Sakura.

96
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
How was your Gaming Week?

97
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,380
Full of Guns N' Roses pinball, apparently, because my hubby has seen fit to play a lot

98
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,520
and lots of Guns N' Roses pinballs.

99
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,920
So I either come home to Welcome to the Jungle or Night Train or My Michelle.

100
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,200
And where I love old school...

101
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,280
My Michelle rocks, just for the record.

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Yeah.

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,440
Where I love Guns N' Roses, there's so much I can hear of Night Train, because Dan always

104
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,500
gets to that level and then music somehow gets louder.

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,400
And the thing is, it's like synthesized guitar and everything, like listening to a Super

106
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,800
Nintendo with Axl, you know, all fuzzy over it.

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,480
I was like, dude, no.

108
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:35,800
And I made myself an Xbox Live account, and so I have my own gamertag now.

109
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
After all this time, you finally made your own damn account?

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Because of the PSU demo.

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Yeah.

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Which I haven't played yet.

113
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I just downloaded it.

114
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Okay.

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,720
But for anyone who wants to know, oh my god, I'm going to regret this.

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,520
Go to the forums and look it up.

117
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,160
Yeah, go to the forums and look it up, because I posted it on the gamertag.

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,640
See then it's a free advertisement for the forums.

119
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840
There you go.

120
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,200
And then, this doesn't have to do with anything about, well, actually playing a game, but

121
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,560
it made me think of it since you guys were talking about Katamari, is I had a dream on

122
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,040
like Thursday night that I was rolling a Katamari over my work.

123
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,400
You remember the last time I had dreams about that, right?

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,880
I left that job.

125
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Really?

126
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
To another one.

127
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Yeah.

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Makes me think of that ad that was on.

129
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,520
I think it was for like a bank or credit card or something that showed the Katamari rolling

130
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,920
down the hills in San Francisco.

131
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,800
I mean, the ad agency denied it was inspired by Katamari, but that's what any gamer would

132
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,360
think about when they see that commercial is, oh, ha ha, Katamari.

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Actually, I still have the parody that I made from when I worked at the student loan place,

134
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,560
so I'll post it up in the chat room.

135
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,040
All right.

136
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Yeah.

137
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,880
Loki, how was your gaming week?

138
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
It was okay.

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
What did I play?

140
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,000
I didn't play a whole lot.

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,920
More Saints Row, because that games are really fun.

142
00:05:52,920 --> 00:06:00,040
I finally stole a Titan, which is an armored car with money in it, and I have been performing

143
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,400
the wonderful money duping glitch that's in the game where you can basically blow this

144
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,680
car up over and over collecting the money in it and buying it over again.

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Fun stuff.

146
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,760
Grand Theft Auto, of course, Liberty City Stories, still waiting for Vice City Stories.

147
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,640
Only a few more weeks, a few more weeks, then we can switch games, finally.

148
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,880
And then, other than that, really not a whole lot.

149
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,160
I was meaning to set up my PlayStation 2 and play some games on that, but I need to buy

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,760
a VGA cable for it so I can hook it up to my computer because, unfortunately, Nelly

151
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,940
wants to hog the TV with Zuma.

152
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,940
And so, you know...

153
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
But she's not a gamer.

154
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,540
No, not at all.

155
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,480
She's a single gamer, I guess.

156
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,260
But so, yeah, unfortunately, I can't really play the games on there, so I have to wait

157
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
for that.

158
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,160
I'm packing because I'm moving next week, so that kind of puts a damper on playing games

159
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
and stuff.

160
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,280
But I did play a little bit of Dig Dug, which is kind of neat because that came out this

161
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
week.

162
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I don't know.

163
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
It's just Dig Dug.

164
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,900
I mean, what do you expect?

165
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,240
And then, tried a little bit more of Need for Speed Carbon.

166
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,800
The demo's pretty awesome, actually.

167
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm pretty impressed with it so far.

168
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,400
So may need to check that out once the game finally makes its way out here.

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,980
And then, of course, I know there's some...I tried playing the multiplayer demo of Splinter

170
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,400
Cell, Double Agent, but unfortunately, at the time, I was torrenting a bunch of stuff

171
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,680
and Xbox Live didn't like that too much.

172
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,520
So I'll have to try that next week.

173
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,560
I think that's about all I played, yeah.

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,960
All right.

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,320
My gaming week, a lot of the old standbys.

176
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,600
I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, a little more progress in Enchanted Arms.

177
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
New stuff I checked out this week, though.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,960
I downloaded Dig Dug when it came out on Wednesday, because out of the old Namco classics that

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,840
have been released recently, Pac-Man and Galaga, I would say Dig Dug's my favorite.

180
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,920
It was just always my favorite a long time ago.

181
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,280
I remember playing the game a hell of a lot on Commodore 64 and at a local pizza place

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,980
when local pizza places had a lot of good arcade games.

183
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,400
So it was cool.

184
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,580
It was kind of a little bit of memories.

185
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,480
I have to admit, though, I'm a little bit disappointed, as I'm sure most Xbox fans are

186
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,280
feeling, is that it seems like we've just had nothing but a barrage over the past couple

187
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,440
months of rehashed old classic games, and we're really looking forward to some of the

188
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,000
new stuff, Lumines, Castle Crashers, all this other stuff that's supposed to be coming out.

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,280
I believe I heard somewhere that Xbox has their stuff.

190
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,960
I want to say when we did the story last week about Duke Nukem, the possibilities of that

191
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,240
coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, they had said that Xbox Live has its calendar full through

192
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,360
the end of the year, or something like that, and it's kind of like, why aren't we seeing

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,040
releases every week, or why aren't we seeing more homegrown stuff?

194
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,600
Why can't they release more than one game a week?

195
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Is that so difficult?

196
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I don't know.

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I mean, seriously.

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I don't know.

199
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,520
But yeah, Dig Dug, yay, another classic game, not so yay, but for the value of $5, you can't

200
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
really complain.

201
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,960
It's got really easy achievements if you're into hoarding up the achievements, and unfortunately

202
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,520
no multiplayer or any of that stuff, but it's Dig Dug.

203
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,960
Either you remember it from your childhood and you love it, or you'll download the demo

204
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,540
and think, oh, another 1980s game that I may or may not buy, depending on how much nostalgia

205
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,580
means to me.

206
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,320
Going from something very nostalgic to something very new, it's kind of nostalgic in a way.

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,720
I also played Mortal Kombat Armageddon on PlayStation 2, which is the clusterfuck Mortal

208
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
Kombat, so to speak.

209
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,840
Every single character who was ever in a Mortal Kombat game, except for one obscure, you don't

210
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,200
even remember this chick, but most every single character's in it.

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,320
Did you try the Mario Kart type game?

212
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
I did.

213
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,520
The Motor Kombat, or whatever it's called?

214
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
It's cheesy.

215
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,620
I mean, don't expect...

216
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,080
It's not a racing game.

217
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,120
Mortal Kombat Armageddon was not designed to be a racing game.

218
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,160
It's definitely something extra they tacked on.

219
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
It's cute, it's fun, but it'll get old fast.

220
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,760
The tracks are very simple in design.

221
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,800
They're very, very simple, and each kart only really has one attack that it does, depending

222
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,360
on which character you are.

223
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,280
For instance, Johnny Cage will launch a green bomb onto the track in front of him so he

224
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,760
can hit guys in front of you.

225
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,720
Melina does a boost type thing.

226
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,920
It's a very simple game.

227
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,840
This is not a replacement for Mario Kart.

228
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,720
It's just something extra to giggle at for a few minutes.

229
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,400
The game itself is based off the engine of the previous games.

230
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,480
Unfortunately, I do feel they had to dumb it down a little bit to fit all of the characters,

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,440
just the massive characters they have in this game.

232
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,760
Each character now only has one fighting style and a weapon, but you get a fair tradeoff

233
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,840
because now you have the create a character mode, although essentially what I noticed

234
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,880
in create a character mode is, costumes aside, pretty much everything else you're buying,

235
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,680
you're just buying bits and pieces of what the other characters already have.

236
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,540
But it's still kind of neat.

237
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,600
Some folks like the Barbie mode in their fighting games, so it's kind of fun.

238
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,640
I would say if you like the previous Mortal Kombat games, you're probably going to like

239
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:16,620
this one too, but as far as entry level Mortal Kombat games go, as far as fighting, I actually

240
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,040
think I kind of preferred the last one a little bit, but I don't know.

241
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,600
Actually I haven't gotten to play this one in depth enough yet.

242
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,520
I'll be honest, I didn't even get a chance to check out Conquest mode, which I wanted

243
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
to.

244
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
I heard it short though.

245
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,000
But I really liked the last one, and it was pretty intricate with the fighting styles

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,160
because you had combos that would chain from one style to another to the weapon.

247
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,920
Well, the last one technically was Shell and Monks, so that wasn't really a Mortal Kombat

248
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
game.

249
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
No, not that one.

250
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
The one before it.

251
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Deception.

252
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Deception, yeah.

253
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I actually think I kind of preferred that one.

254
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,480
So what if it didn't have the big cluster of characters?

255
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,000
I've had enough to keep the game fresh and moving.

256
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,240
But if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, this is definitely fan service.

257
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,000
I would say the other disappointing thing about this game is I'm kind of surprised it's

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,960
not next gen.

259
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,280
I think if they went next gen with it, then maybe they could have squeezed all that stuff

260
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
into it.

261
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,640
Of course, it probably would have been in development for another year, but I don't

262
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
know.

263
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,840
They're probably working on one.

264
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
It's not bad.

265
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,360
If we're fighting, considering the amount of variety you get with this game, it's actually

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
pretty good.

267
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,640
It's a fighting game itself.

268
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:25,640
I feel a game like Soul Calibur II or III even is much more intricate in the fighting

269
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,560
styles, whereas this is just variety, fan service, just throwing tons of different things

270
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
at you.

271
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,840
So take it as you will.

272
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
And then that's about it.

273
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,160
One other thing, but we'll get to that later.

274
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,200
So I'll ask Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

275
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,000
My gaming week was pretty good, shockingly, since I'm not only playing Final Fantasy XI

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
anymore.

277
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,280
This week I played a good amount of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Luminous Live on Xbox

278
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Live.

279
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Wait a minute.

280
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Wait a minute.

281
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,600
How come the rest of us haven't gotten a chance to play that?

282
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,520
Because you guys don't use Microsoft's network.

283
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Oh, I see.

284
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
You're special.

285
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
I'm special.

286
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Okay.

287
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,240
And I had a great time with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

288
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,060
Luminous Live, not so much.

289
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,120
The 360 controller really, really, really sucks for that game.

290
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,880
I also picked up three new games this week.

291
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,760
I picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and that's kind of boring, but it got me through

292
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,400
the Wii pre-order line on Friday.

293
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,160
I also picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner, and that's a really, really neat

294
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
game.

295
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm not too far in it.

296
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,320
And I picked up Mortal Kombat Armageddon, and I think it's a decent game, but they screwed

297
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,900
up Rain, and he was my favorite character.

298
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,520
So I was not too happy about that.

299
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,740
Other than that, haven't really played much else, I guess, except for what we'll be talking

300
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,160
about later.

301
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,920
So that's about it.

302
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,600
Other questions in chat room, the always present extra guest on our show, orangelaunchradio.com,

303
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
click on chat.

304
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,120
Jeremy Todd 1 asks, Miklotov, so you're saying the shitty 360 controller's D-pad works good

305
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,220
for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3?

306
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,280
Actually yeah, because you can perform the rolling moves, like down to forward and stuff

307
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,000
like that, really easily.

308
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,960
So yeah, I would say it works pretty well for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

309
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,760
How about the lag in the game, because I know that was something that was a bitch with Street

310
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,680
Fighter 2, and I was just wondering if they fixed that kind of stuff.

311
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,400
I didn't notice any lag, honestly.

312
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
It was really nice.

313
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,060
Yeah, but wouldn't it be harder to judge on your network, though, because that's like

314
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,120
a different thing than the public thing?

315
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
That's true.

316
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,400
So I mean, it might be different on the public.

317
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
I think we got some pretty bad lag, though, when we were playing Street Fighter before

318
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
it came out, also.

319
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,760
Interesting.

320
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,080
There was another comment in chat room, Blaze said, Skye, the original Mortal Kombat never

321
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
had the variety.

322
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
It's a true throwback.

323
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,320
Yeah, I guess, but you know, your expectation level of fighting games was different back

324
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
then.

325
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,920
But then again, come to think of it, that was kind of one of Mortal Kombat's weaknesses

326
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
in the beginning.

327
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,720
I mean, yeah, it had fatalities, but the first one, as great of a game as it is, it is a

328
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,680
little clunky, especially on the Genesis.

329
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,560
How would you like to create a fatality mode in that?

330
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
Oh yeah, that was the other thing about the game that bothered me.

331
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,600
You don't really create a fatality.

332
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,840
You just kind of do these, when it goes finish him, you just start doing like, tor tor square,

333
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,000
a way toward X, you just start doing all this random stuff, and they'll do all these types

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,040
of random things.

335
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,360
Some of them are kind of funny, like one fatality I watched Miklotov do, he ripped somebody's

336
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,040
arms off and then knocked their face off with the arms, which is kind of funny, but the

337
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,260
only problem with that is that once you've kind of gone through that, there actually

338
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,760
isn't this level of variety that you'd think.

339
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,840
I think it was a lot cooler when everybody kind of had their own unique thing they did,

340
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,960
but I understand, again, 60-something characters, it's probably harder to do that, so that's

341
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,320
why they had to go here.

342
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,680
And like I was talking earlier to you about it, I don't think it's totally just that,

343
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,800
it fits with the overall game's theme where everybody's just kind of rushing towards trying

344
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,480
to get this power, and you know, it's not so much a tournament anymore as it's, let's

345
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,340
just quickly kill as many people as we can so we can get farther than everybody else

346
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,840
and get this power.

347
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,400
I do like the fact that maybe the unlock's a lot easier in this game, you don't have

348
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,480
the red, green, blue, grey coins, you just have coins, period, and then you know what

349
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,960
you're unlocking before you do it, unlike the crypt where you had to open up a coffin

350
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,160
and hope it had something good, unless you were cheating using GameFAQs, so anyway.

351
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,320
Anyway, enough about my gaming week, let's get into some housekeeping news.

352
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,240
There's actually not going to be a live show next week, we're going to pre-tape number

353
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,480
205, that's because two of us are going to be out of town next Sunday, so there's not

354
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,960
going to be a live show on Sunday, I believe we're going to pre-tape Wednesday night at

355
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,040
this point, it's going to replace the usual guys on a show that you hear on the live station

356
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,520
only here on Wednesday night, so we will be pre-taping live.

357
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,620
There is, though, something I'm going to bring back that happened at Disneyland, or I should

358
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,400
say didn't happen, no one found me.

359
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
Well, it's a big place.

360
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Yeah.

361
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,960
But I'm going to be at YowieCon this, next weekend, and I will be cosplaying as an Organization

362
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,160
13 member, so you will see me.

363
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Nerd!

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
Chris and Megsy are doing it, too.

365
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Nerds!

366
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,600
I know, but we're cute nerds.

367
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,440
So we are going to be in the big trench coats with stuff.

368
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,500
If you find me, then you will get a CD sampler.

369
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,080
Some CDs from a different drum.

370
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Yeah.

371
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,560
Yeah, we have little three-inch singles, Rain Dancer with Come With Me and Rupesh Cartel,

372
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,880
Death with Soft Names, but one of the B-sides on that single is Yours to Command, which

373
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,600
is one of the new Ditter songs that we premiered earlier on in the DDR preview segment.

374
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,720
So if you find me, if I'm not completely fawning over the Yowie action, then you get

375
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
a present.

376
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,520
I was going to say the man-gina.

377
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,820
But I will also make this disclaimer, and I'm going to be singing Nightmare Before Christmas

378
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:21,000
in 3-D at the Metreon on Friday night, and I will extend it there if somebody recognizes

379
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,680
me, you get the CD.

380
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,480
If not at YowieCon, then at the Metreon.

381
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,640
I worry maybe I should give you some more, because there might be a lot of our listeners

382
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
at YowieCon.

383
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
I'll tell you what.

384
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
First three people.

385
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
How's that?

386
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
We got a lot of these.

387
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
We got a lot of these.

388
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
So there you go.

389
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,520
Two other ones for YowieCon, one is for Nightmare Before Christmas.

390
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
There you go.

391
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Right there.

392
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Three pairs to give away.

393
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Have fun.

394
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:51,600
All right, so go find Dark Sakura at YowieCon.

395
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,160
I thought she already had one.

396
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
That's all right.

397
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
She wants to keep one for herself.

398
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
I see how it is.

399
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
That's fine.

400
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,640
I actually forgot that I already had one, but oh well.

401
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
That's all right.

402
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Have fun.

403
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,720
Give those singles away.

404
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,560
I will be traveling as well this weekend.

405
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,520
This is the weekend where I'm finally going to New York City.

406
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,960
Yes, I missed Digital Life by one whole week because I'm just cool like that.

407
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,040
I will be in New York City this weekend, and I took some listeners' advice and scheduled

408
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,840
a time to be at the Nintendo World Store.

409
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,800
Now here's the thing.

410
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,080
I haven't exactly cleared it with them or anything, and I'm not expecting a swarm of

411
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
people.

412
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,720
We don't exactly have that many people listening to the program, but I will be there Saturday

413
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,640
at noon, so come look for me at the Nintendo World Store.

414
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
You know what?

415
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,920
I have friends, too, so they can come find me.

416
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
So it's a West Coast-East Coast thing.

417
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,120
You can come find Jamie on the West Coast, and you can come find me on the East Coast.

418
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
So you can find some more.

419
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Exactly.

420
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,360
So that will be Saturday at noon at the Nintendo World Store.

421
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
I will be there.

422
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
And Loki, you can find on his couch all weekend long.

423
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:08,400
I'll be on my couch at my house, and I will have a CD in case you find me, just in case.

424
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,360
Mikl Tov, will you be anywhere for the fans to meet?

425
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,040
Actually, no one knows what you look like, anyway.

426
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Yeah, they don't.

427
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,160
I'll be at work, probably, so if you find me at work, I'll give you a high-five, because

428
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I don't have CDs.

429
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
All right.

430
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Sounds good.

431
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,520
Actually, I should, because the picture on the form is sort of outdated.

432
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:33,000
My hair is dyed red now with black streaks in the front, so it will probably be straight,

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
not curly.

434
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,200
Yeah, you look a little different than you do in the album art that you see on iTunes,

435
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,680
like when you download, because that picture is like six months old.

436
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,000
More than that.

437
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,880
We did those pictures last winter.

438
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Wow.

439
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Long time.

440
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
We need new ones.

441
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
It's time for new pictures.

442
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
New ones.

443
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
All right.

444
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,640
But if anyone looks at my DeviantArt account on my Deviant tag, that's what my hair looks

445
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
like.

446
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,680
All right.

447
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,040
So come find us.

448
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,600
New York City, Saturday, YALIcon, Metreon, all weekend long.

449
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,960
Orange Orange Radio invades coast to coast.

450
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,920
DDR previews a little bit later on in this segment.

451
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,480
Two new songs from Ultramix 4 and two new songs from DDR Universe tonight.

452
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,280
But first, some gaming news.

453
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Yes.

454
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Lots of gaming news.

455
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:19,840
And of course, you know, like every year, we were looking forward to E3, keyword is

456
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
were.

457
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:28,320
Unfortunately, E3, as announced last, well, actually earlier this year, it's been downsized.

458
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,240
So yeah, unfortunately we won't be able to see this wonderful giant expo with 60,000

459
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,960
plus people in it.

460
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,800
And well anyways, here's the details on what's going to be happening with this.

461
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,880
It's now being called the E3 Media and Business Summit.

462
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:50,720
It will take place between July 11th and the 13th in Santa Monica, California.

463
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,880
And they're actually going to be taking up several hotels as well as the large Barker

464
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,760
Hanger, which is going to be kind of a show floor type thing, I don't know.

465
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,760
I guess a place that they can use to demonstrate stuff, basically.

466
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,720
And it's going to be invite only.

467
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,840
And basically, according to Doug Lowenstein, this is kind of how he's summing up the whole

468
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
E3.

469
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,820
E3 is not a place where product is sold anymore.

470
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,240
The industry is recognized as a big part of mainstream culture.

471
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,360
So the need for a big glittering event to validate the industry is not what it used

472
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,700
to be.

473
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,940
What is needed is to focus on the fact that E3 is going to be much more about media related

474
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,400
opportunities.

475
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,240
The question is, what is the most efficient way to create those opportunities?

476
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
Here's my question to Doug Lowenstein there.

477
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:52,320
When you say media, do you mean media or the people that have TV shows and giant multi

478
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,680
million dollar websites because talking with some of the other publishers out there, that

479
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
seems to be the case.

480
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,360
They just kind of want to ignore the smaller guys.

481
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,220
So just remember that the smaller guys do have a reach out there in the marketplace

482
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,840
and do contact your customers.

483
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,160
So take that in mind when you're picking those select thousands of people that are going

484
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,380
to be at this event.

485
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,560
So that whole thing where he says there's no need for E3 to be the glittering event

486
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,300
it once was, he's basically saying, Paris Hilton, stay home.

487
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,720
Keep your skanky ass at home with your dumb little dog and get the hell away from my show.

488
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,960
To that I say, Amen.

489
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,680
I understand because there are a lot of people there and it's hard to conduct business, but

490
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:49,160
at the same time, it's good to have the publicity for your games, especially the smaller companies.

491
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,240
They want people noticing their game there because then it gets covered and then the

492
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
word spreads about it.

493
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,780
I think that there are the major news sites out there, but the smaller guys also get the

494
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
message out.

495
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,960
When you're reading it on some of the smaller sites, it's like, wow, this information might

496
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,880
be pretty big if it's being covered.

497
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,160
The smaller sites don't tend to just copy and paste the press release.

498
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,880
Not that I'm insinuating that the big boys do anything, but I overheard at a recent media

499
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,880
event, big boys saying that's essentially what they did is they copied and pasted from

500
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,280
the press release.

501
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,260
So if that's what you want, why bother throwing a show?

502
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,800
Just fucking email E3.

503
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,480
Just put E3 in a zip file and send it to their email.

504
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,520
Web conference, not in a conference room with those intercom things.

505
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
I don't know.

506
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm just worried.

507
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,600
Personally, I'm worried we're not going to be invited.

508
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,440
That's my only worry and it would be very disappointing to me because I really do care

509
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,760
about seeing these companies' product and helping promote that stuff.

510
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,960
That's kind of why we go, but they don't think that just because...

511
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,040
I like how certain TV shows out there, even though they don't cover gaming anymore, still

512
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,520
get top listing on these new events.

513
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
I don't know.

514
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,400
I'm not trying to be focused on that.

515
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,520
If they don't want coverage, then we'll cover something else that wants the coverage that

516
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm sure is a decent game, fine.

517
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,680
But I think it's interesting that the whole thing is being held in Santa Monica because

518
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,380
I think about, shit, we stayed in Santa Monica for the last E3 and had that horrible commute

519
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,120
to downtown LA that made us late for those shows we were doing for Marina.

520
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
That hotel we stayed at, the Best Western or whatever it was, probably going to be twice

521
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,880
as expensive next year now that E3 is there.

522
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,400
But I then think about, boy, Scott over at All Games and the folks at Arena Interactive

523
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Lounge where we broadcast...

524
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Snack dab in the middle of it.

525
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,720
They're probably having a fucking field day at this news.

526
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,440
They're probably so excited.

527
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,200
But I also think, and I'm not insinuating anything, I don't know shit about what they're

528
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,360
doing next year, but just knowing the type of guy that Scott is, he will try and get

529
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,680
some of those indie developers that get shut out of the big show over at the Arena.

530
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,000
My gut tells me based on some things I saw last year that probably I wouldn't put it

531
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,960
past those guys to try and do some type of unofficial E3 satellite thingy there and it's

532
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,720
going to be right in the heart of everything.

533
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,360
And I say, fine, we'll cover that if we can't get into the big show.

534
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,600
So I'm looking forward to it anyways.

535
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,720
Outpost is where it's at next year.

536
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,040
I miss my yearly playing of X-Tango.

537
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,200
Yeah, poor X-Tango.

538
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,920
Hey, yeah, Scott, if you're listening, get the X-Tango folks at Arena.

539
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,400
Tell them to give me a copy.

540
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,680
So we can ask them if their game's ever going to freaking come out.

541
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
That'd be nice.

542
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,480
It's going to be part of the brand new Duke Nukem Forever.

543
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Coming out on the Phantom.

544
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Anyway, speaking of games that we've been waiting for, the demo for Phantasy Star Universe

545
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,520
on Xbox 360 is out.

546
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,160
Today being Sunday for us, is the last day that you can download it.

547
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,800
I think it was down midnight on Saturday.

548
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,280
Well, whatever, by the time the people who download this show hear it, it's too late.

549
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,680
Well, at any rate, I haven't played mine yet.

550
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,560
I did download it yesterday, which is why I made my whole gamertag account and everything.

551
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,840
But it will be up for play until Wednesday midnight, so that's the only time you're going

552
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
to get to.

553
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,520
Of course, it's already been in Japan forever, and I already know someone who has it on PC.

554
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,560
But you know what's really pissy though about the Japanese release is that your CDs are

555
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:42,600
all coded much like the US ones were for the GameCube and Dreamcast.

556
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,120
But you also can only register online, and Sega got a whole crap load of complaints about

557
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,520
that from people who don't have internet service or dial up.

558
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,600
Or they just want to play the single player mode.

559
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,160
They bought it just for single player, but you cannot play unless you register, even

560
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
single player.

561
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Ouch.

562
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Well, as for the open beta, once the actual release is out, it will be $9.99 a month for

563
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,640
our European listeners.

564
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,920
That's 6.99 pounds.

565
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,880
And they're saying that it will be available for your license, or they're calling it guardian

566
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,960
license, will be available for purchase beginning the 24th of November on PC, PlayStation 2,

567
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
and Xbox 360.

568
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,680
Luckily, all the achievements are offline, so I can just rent this thing, which is excellent

569
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
horror.

570
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:39,120
And note the other best part about that beta demo is Tuesday that Xbox Live is going to

571
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,200
be down the whole day, so you actually only get about two days to play that.

572
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Thank you, Sega.

573
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Yeah, that's true.

574
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,440
Yeah, Xbox Live is going to be down Tuesday, so whoops, whoopsie daisy, forgot to plan

575
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
for that.

576
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Oh well.

577
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:57,560
At any rate, it's already out on PC in Japan, and that hasn't stopped people.

578
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,920
My friend who's actually had this game now for about, I would say she's had about three

579
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,320
weeks to a month, right?

580
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,360
There is someone who is on one of the big Phantasy Star sites, again I'm not going to

581
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,640
list names publicly, has made a loading tool for this to bypass the online registration.

582
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,800
You cannot play it online, but you can play it in single player mode if you want to try

583
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,120
out the PC version.

584
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,800
Just look around, it's out there.

585
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,800
I actually got to play the PSU demo, or beta, whatever you want to call it.

586
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,180
The thing is though, it's kind of hard for me to base my judgment off of beta, because

587
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,080
even though the full game is out in ten days, you did download something that's usually

588
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,240
going to be on a DVD, whatever.

589
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,320
But also the thing is that this thing is getting flooded with people that are just like, OMG

590
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,920
free game.

591
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
That's the problem.

592
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,480
I can't wait for these people to be gone, and it's just the people who actually want

593
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,040
to be playing and paid good money for Phantasy Star Universe, and then they'll stop bogging

594
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,120
the servers, I think.

595
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,440
As for the game itself, what I did get to play, the only problem I had with it is the

596
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,720
tutorial was a little bit clunky and would freeze up, so it was easier to bypass it.

597
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,520
If you bypass the tutorial, then you kind of don't know what you're doing in the game,

598
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,200
because just enough has changed from Phantasy Star Online.

599
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,640
Finally, once I figured it out and got in there, it was kind of fun, and I played with

600
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,080
a stranger through one level, and it ran pretty well.

601
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,560
I've got to say, some of the sceneries are really nice.

602
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,600
If you figure out, for those that are playing the beta, go out to the fourth floor, go out

603
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,020
the left side, and then you can transport to different planets, and you can transport

604
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:53,240
to this greenish planet that has a very ancient China-looking city, and then if you go out

605
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,200
in the world there, even though the mission is a level 15 mission, just kind of go into

606
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
it and see what it looks like.

607
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
It's really pretty.

608
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,680
It looks like fall, and things are falling from the trees.

609
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,440
It's nice-looking.

610
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,680
I don't think it's OMG, next-gen, to-the-max nice-looking, but that makes sense, seeing

611
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,880
as it was developed for PlayStation 2 as well, but it's nice.

612
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,280
I probably will pick up the retail version, only because I know at least Miklotov will

613
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,760
play with me, and probably DarkSakura and our buddy Kasumi as well will all be playing.

614
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,640
So it'll be fun, because there will be people to play with.

615
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,360
The one thing that I sort of hope is that since we've done this massive download, it

616
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,160
would be nice, though, for the folks that actually have gone into the effort of downloading

617
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,060
the game, that we could just play off the downloaded version, but maybe there could

618
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,960
be a quick mode or something that they actually use the demo version for.

619
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Oh, I see.

620
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Well, they already said you're not going to be able to transfer your character you made

621
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,000
in the beta over, so...

622
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's ridiculous.

623
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, well.

624
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Miklotov, what do you think?

625
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You've spent a lot of time playing this.

626
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,360
I really like it.

627
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,700
I have a few really glaring issues with it, though.

628
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,480
So I play as a force on Phantasy Star Online, because they're the best.

629
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,720
And in this game, from what I can tell so far is that the only way I can do magic is

630
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,080
if I equip it to a weapon.

631
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,680
So I'm going to have to carry multiple weapons, or maybe, I don't know, I'm talking as loud

632
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,000
as I can.

633
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,080
I have to equip multiple weapons so I can have different magic spells, and that's going

634
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,320
to really make me angry.

635
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,480
And I like that Sega's crazy word filtering stuff still happens.

636
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,240
Somebody had to use periods to cuss at me today, and it was pretty funny.

637
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,040
Why were they cussing at you?

638
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,640
Because they're like 12-year-olds that are playing Xbox Live.

639
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
OMG free game.

640
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Yeah, exactly, like what you said earlier.

641
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
Have you made voice chat in that?

642
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Voice chat?

643
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I don't know.

644
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
I didn't party, because I don't want to play with other people right now.

645
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,960
I believe voice chat is only available once you get into a zone.

646
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,240
It's not like in the lobby, like it was in the first game.

647
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,360
I think it actually is.

648
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
It's in party.

649
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Yeah.

650
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,000
So one thing, though, that for anybody who is playing on Sega's website, they do have

651
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,100
a feedback form.

652
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,200
They want feedback from the beta, apparently.

653
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,380
So make sure that if you see any glitches, anything weird, anything you don't like, make

654
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,600
sure that you post about it on their page.

655
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,120
Doesn't it seem like they're kind of a little close, though, with only 10 days to go?

656
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
I mean, is this going to be another 8 days?

657
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,680
If it's something that just requires a general tweak or a change in code, then...

658
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,120
But the game's got to have already been shipped to retailers, essentially, waiting to go out.

659
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,200
But I think it's talking about major glitches.

660
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,920
Yeah, I know, but here we go again, another Xbox 360 game where they're patching it on

661
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,320
the back end to fix all the bugs.

662
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
You know, I'm just kind of like...

663
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,920
That happens with any type of MMO.

664
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
I guess.

665
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,760
MMOs exist to be glitchy.

666
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,200
I just hope it doesn't stay, you know, rappy Christmas for five years like the old Xbox

667
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
one.

668
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,400
You know, it sucks that it is glitchy, but we shouldn't expect MMOs to be glitchy.

669
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
That's just fucking laziness in programming is what it is.

670
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,040
I mean, you should be doing extensive beta testing on it, especially since the game came

671
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,840
out already in Japan.

672
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,760
You've already got, you know, some beta testing right there, you know, whatever you want to

673
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
call it.

674
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,200
But I think it's really ridiculous just to say, oh, yeah, this is a beta test, and hopefully

675
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,120
everything goes well because we already done the game.

676
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,160
So if we find a bug, yeah, that fucking sucks.

677
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Any other thoughts on PSU?

678
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,840
The only other thing I don't like about it, and I know I'm being negative about it, but

679
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,480
I do really like the game.

680
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,880
At least in PSO, you all kind of look the same, like, you know, all the forces had dresses

681
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,380
and such.

682
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:55,020
But their creation in this game, while it's highly detailed, the costumes, each, like,

683
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,140
the newmans and the humans for each gender, they all get the same costumes.

684
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,560
So you see a lot of the same people running around.

685
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,480
It's pretty terrible because, I mean, I don't want to see a whole bunch of people with just

686
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,800
the black and red shirt on, and it doesn't seem like anybody's really, you know, their

687
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,480
own character because of it.

688
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,400
I do understand that the RBG slider has been removed to change color.

689
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Oh, really?

690
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,960
I didn't know it was there in, like, the...

691
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
It was in the old ones.

692
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,680
You could change the colors of the outfits.

693
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,960
Oh, no, it was...

694
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,920
The hair and different tones.

695
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
You can do it for some of it.

696
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,320
Oh, you can still do the hairs and, like, the eyes and stuff, which is really cool because

697
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,680
you can do eyes before, it's just depending on your face.

698
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,920
But I mean, at least there were, like, different patterns on the different outfits you could

699
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,960
pick in PSO, but now it's just palette swaps, and they look pretty terrible.

700
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,680
You know, since Miklotov likes to play a force, essentially what he's saying is he misses

701
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,600
being able to wear a dress in Phantasy Star Online.

702
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Yeah, actually, I kind of do it.

703
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,080
It doesn't look like a force if I'm wearing shorts and a short-sleeve shirt.

704
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
I'm sorry.

705
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,240
Dude, the forces were great because the men had these evening gowns, and...

706
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,760
Well, what I'm thinking is they probably removed some of the stuff for the beta.

707
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,520
I mean, because it's, you know, they cut down the file size.

708
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,640
I think it's actually like that on the PC version.

709
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,840
I'll have to, I actually have to ask my friend who's been playing it.

710
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh, hopefully they'll release more later.

711
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
I don't know.

712
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,520
There's supposed to be downloadable patches later for extra outfits and things you can

713
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,080
earn, stuff like that.

714
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
All right.

715
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,720
Well, we'll have a more full review of the actual game itself once it's released.

716
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,640
I'm sure at least one of us, if not two or three of us, are going to pick that thing

717
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,960
up, so we'll give you our full thoughts on the game a little later.

718
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,400
In the meantime, if you haven't downloaded the beta yet, too bad.

719
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,880
You're not going to get a chance.

720
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,960
Moving on to another Xbox-related story, Microsoft is teaming up with Best Buy and the Boys and

721
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,000
Girls Club of America to go on a 20-city bus tour.

722
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They're going to be educating parents on the ESRB rating scheme and how to implement parental

723
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,320
controls on the Xbox 360 and the Xbox Live service.

724
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,280
In other words, hopefully there'll be a tutorial on how to block asses on the Xbox 360 cams

725
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,640
for parents.

726
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:20,040
This is a nice, good service, feel-good community thing, but it certainly doesn't help in selling

727
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,120
parents on Xbox 360s, does it?

728
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
I'm sorry?

729
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I think it does.

730
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
What do you mean?

731
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Oh, no, no.

732
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
I'm being a little bit sarcastic.

733
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Oh, sorry.

734
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm stupid.

735
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,560
I'm telling parents on the Xbox 360, like, look at what a great, family-friendly system

736
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
we are.

737
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,000
Nintendo, eat your heart out, you know, type thing, even though, you know, I'm again being

738
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,720
sarcastic because obviously Nintendo and Sony both will have very similar things built in

739
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
their systems.

740
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Anyway, the tour is going to be going around pretty much the top cities in the U.S. where

741
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:56,200
the most people are, you know, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco,

742
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Seattle.

743
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,600
If you want to check out the full schedule, you can always check out xbox.com slash is

744
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,440
your family set.

745
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,720
Is your family set, Loki?

746
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,520
I would hope so because I don't have a family.

747
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,840
I'm set, so, you know, whatever.

748
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,120
I'm set and ready to see some Xbox cam boobies and cocks.

749
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,880
Let's make sure you're 18 and over, please.

750
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,160
I have the internet for boobs.

751
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,200
Well, I haven't seen any of that stuff yet, but yeah, that'd be kind of fun.

752
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
No, neither have I. I'm just kidding.

753
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
I don't really want to see it.

754
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,840
They should have a channel that's only that stuff.

755
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Like the underground?

756
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,360
Like, yeah, something like the red light district or something.

757
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,760
Yeah, you do get to classify yourself.

758
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,480
It's called the green door.

759
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,080
You get to classify yourself, you know, under Xbox, like, oh, you're recreational, you're

760
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,040
pro or you're underground, right?

761
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,560
They do need red light district.

762
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,520
But I have never seen those categories actually dictate where you actually get placed.

763
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
Oh, I have.

764
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
Have you?

765
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,040
Yeah, for ChromeHounds, actually, when you're inviting people, you can make it specific

766
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
to certain...

767
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Oh, whatever.

768
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
All right.

769
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Whatever.

770
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,560
Well, it's pretty cool that they're, you know, kind of given some guidance to parents as

771
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,160
far as, you know, helping their kids with games and stuff.

772
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Although some people, though, should have been receiving better guidance when they dropped

773
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,160
out of high school to play professional video games.

774
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:23,280
One such person, Tom Taylor, T-squared for short, is actually some 20-something year

775
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:32,520
old professional gamer who has landed a $250,000 gaming contract in addition to running his

776
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,880
brand new video game tutoring company.

777
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:43,640
And basically the Associated Press spoke with him about his, you know, earning six figures.

778
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,600
And basically his response to the whole thing was, he takes risks.

779
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I take risks.

780
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,320
In order to get paid, you have to take risks.

781
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,560
I think I took the biggest risk I could take dropping out of school to play video games

782
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,800
and it paid off.

783
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,620
I guess some people are just born with talent in certain things like Michael Jordan was

784
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,200
born to play basketball.

785
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,040
I feel I was born to play video games.

786
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,700
Yeah, that's a really great role model.

787
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,680
Drop out of school so you can play video games professionally.

788
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,100
I don't want to see this guy be, yeah, I suggest all the gaming companies out there pick up

789
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,640
this guy as your spokesperson.

790
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
That's perfect.

791
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,420
That is the, you know, perfect role model you want for your customers.

792
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,840
Drop out of school because, you know what, you could buy some games on a minimum wage

793
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
job.

794
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
It's fine.

795
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,080
I want them to hire me.

796
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,880
I finished school.

797
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
I'm an educated gamer.

798
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,120
I want to tear into this guy but I can't help but think that would be a little bit hypocritical

799
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:51,720
when I think back to college and all the class I missed due to Final Fantasy VII.

800
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
But you know.

801
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,080
I used to skip class to watch Sailor Moon.

802
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,200
I think there's nothing wrong in the fact that, you know, playing video games for a

803
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,080
college, I mean granted that's pretty risky, I mean because, and let's not even get into

804
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,000
how ridiculous it is to pay people to play video games professionally, I mean that is

805
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,240
just ridiculous right there.

806
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,800
And I agree it's ridiculous with professional sports and all that stuff too, but whatever,

807
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
okay.

808
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,520
I don't say video games, video games is definitely not a sport, let me put it that way.

809
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
Just like curling.

810
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,040
I think there's a difference too between high school drop out and college drop out.

811
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,240
College drop out, that's fine.

812
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,140
In this society there's an expectation, you know, well certainly, I mean again I guess

813
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,580
it depends on which part of the country you're in, but you know, there's a real pressure

814
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,440
out there to really, you've got to graduate high school if you want to move up in the

815
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
corporate world.

816
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,800
I mean granted there are jobs available and I don't know, because it's like there's exceptions

817
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,960
to every world, but I just feel like, you know, if you're going to drop out of high

818
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,800
school for a family situation, that's one thing, but you're going to drop out of high

819
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,280
school to play video games, I don't know.

820
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,120
And you know, from what I hear too, his team isn't that great.

821
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,840
So I mean, I don't know.

822
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,880
Interesting comments in our chat room though over at orangelawntrader.com, click on chat.

823
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,620
Black Boy says, wait, how many pop stars never went to college?

824
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,960
Or maybe pop stars dropped out of high school.

825
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,180
I have no problem with people not going to college, because you know what, personally

826
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,280
I didn't go to college and I don't think I really missed anything, because there aren't

827
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,800
actually a lot of people that will start up, you know, their own businesses and stuff and

828
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,840
they're very successful without going to college.

829
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,600
I mean, granted, colleges help with certain jobs and stuff like that, but it's not necessary

830
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,680
if you've already got the smarts to kind of do it, you can pretty much, you know, start

831
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,440
up a company and be successful without it.

832
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,700
I dropped out of college, I'm not exactly proud of it, but at the time it's what I had

833
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,200
to do and I don't regret it.

834
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,440
I've actually been in college off and on now for about 10 years.

835
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,460
But see though, high school is important.

836
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,800
I think you should be finishing high school, I mean, because, or at least test out of it.

837
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Yeah, exactly.

838
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,120
You should be doing better education in high school though.

839
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:02,000
Or, okay, I mean, I don't know, I just have a really big problem with someone like this

840
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,400
being kind of a sponsor, because all we need this guy is to actually start playing good

841
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,500
and winning stuff and then have him doing reviews on games and stuff, yeah, I got really

842
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,960
good by not going to high school, yeah, that's excellent.

843
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
In other words, kids, be cool, stay in school.

844
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Exactly.

845
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,680
Any other comments from our chat room here, Funny Dale says, this guy is going to be working

846
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,520
at Burger King in five years cleaning out the fat fryer.

847
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,800
Hit Stun says, I can see him getting a right thumb injury and being out for a season and

848
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
going broke.

849
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,280
So, that's true, what do you have to fall back on if you get carpal tunnel?

850
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
You're screwed young man.

851
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,040
I have to have that Atari controller that used your eyebrows.

852
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,840
Or hopefully in the future we'll be controlling games with our brains.

853
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:57,080
Well, speaking of brains and certain people who remain unnamed on this radio show, not

854
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:04,220
using them, sorry, well, we've all been paying attention to the fact that Bully was pulled

855
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,760
into court for being, you know, violent game, oh my God.

856
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,840
I have a new name for said dummy.

857
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,640
How about Crack Frompson?

858
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,240
I still like Jackie Poo or Jackass.

859
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:27,800
At any rate, the verdict that went down though with the ruling is basically the judge is

860
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,080
not going to prohibit the sale of Bully.

861
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,520
To quote, in the time that he played the game, the judge said he did not see anything so

862
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,640
violent that would require the game to be held from being shipped.

863
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,920
The judge and Take-Two employee used a cheat code in order to skip around in the game.

864
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,640
From what I understand, I think they played through the game for at least two hours, and

865
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,120
that's plenty of time to get a good feel for the game.

866
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,800
They're also saying that there wasn't anything different than what was seen on TV really.

867
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,640
OMG, there's cheat codes to skip around in the game, excellent.

868
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,600
But if anyone's curious about how everybody's not friend, the real bully of the industry

869
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,000
reacted, he was told to sit down.

870
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,240
Wasn't there like outbursts in the courtroom in that whole thing?

871
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
Oh, I would have loved to have been there.

872
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,640
The thing is that he had no business being there because you cannot work, I think, as

873
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,960
legal advisor for something that you have an interest in.

874
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,320
He did mention though that he hoped that people got injured after playing this game so he

875
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,520
could go, I told you so.

876
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,960
Didn't he like sneak a slingshot into the courtroom to make some type of point about

877
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,680
this is what people are going to do?

878
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,280
Okay, okay, I know we're not really supposed to talk about it.

879
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,840
What about Simpsons?

880
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,480
Bart has a slingshot, I don't see slingshot-related deaths in the news.

881
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,720
He's an idiot, plain and simple.

882
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,640
The man has no comp, you can be educated and still be stupid, and this man is living proof.

883
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,920
I cannot wait.

884
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,400
And actually the thing about him being involved in this case is actually, from what I understand,

885
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,800
precedent to have him disbarred in that state, so let's hope it happens.

886
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,100
Raven's Dolphin says, Dennis the Menace has a slingshot.

887
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,400
Go back to like 50s homely- 40s, I think.

888
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Was it?

889
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
40s, yeah.

890
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,780
I know, they were on Nickelodeon when I was a kid, so.

891
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:28,320
It's human nature, I'm trying to remember which philosopher said this, but the nature

892
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,680
of man is nasty, brutish, and short.

893
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,560
People are prone to violence, it's written into our freaking DNA.

894
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,760
No one talks about the dangers of cup stacking, either.

895
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,600
Really Jack Thompson should- oh, I said it.

896
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,280
Now I gotta go kill myself, that's alright.

897
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,960
Him should actually go after them, because cup stacking is very dangerous, I think.

898
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,920
Someone could put in an eye with that stuff.

899
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,560
Why can't he just go back to attacking the music industry, please?

900
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,880
My whole thing is, if they had pulled this game from Wal-Mart, or whatever, he got the

901
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:11,080
result he wanted, doesn't that set the precedent that Wal-Mart ought to be pulling copies of

902
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:17,960
Kill Bill off the shelves, and Pulp Fiction, and other violent train spotting, and other

903
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,400
really violent movies?

904
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,960
It's a double standard.

905
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,240
Of course, maybe Jack Thompson would like that, I don't know.

906
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,820
I said it too, spank, spank, spank.

907
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,280
Maybe they should change it to Bible Mart.

908
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,160
It's still a very nasty double standard that we're seeing in the overall entertainment

909
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,720
industry.

910
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,560
Right now, video games is the current scapegoat.

911
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,560
That's how it is.

912
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:47,960
It was music in the 80s and early 90s, it's evolved on to- back in the days, it was, you

913
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,160
know, we can't watch this TV show because it's so risque, and they attack in the morning-

914
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,560
Oh my god, Mr. and Mrs. Brady share a bed, who knew?

915
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,400
Oh my god, Elvis and his hip thrusting, who knew?

916
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,440
Or people would go on, what was that example, on the Ed Sullivan Show and ask them to change

917
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
lyrics.

918
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,840
Women are going to look at that and get impregnated immediately.

919
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:16,920
Or even now with the whole not having available women's health care because we're going to

920
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,680
decide to take over the world and fuck everybody, I don't know.

921
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,680
Flaming Bozo in our chat room says, why doesn't he go to porn, why doesn't he fight porn?

922
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,160
But at the same time, they don't sell porn at Wal-Mart, although I, well, I don't know.

923
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,960
Everybody knows Jackie Pooh shops at Wal-Mart.

924
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,520
I'm sure they sell Skinamax type movies there, but anyway.

925
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:41,040
We all know that the whole reason he's so retentive is just that he's just not getting

926
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,040
laid.

927
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Wow.

928
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,040
That's it.

929
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,120
All right, well, you know- There's no one would.

930
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:55,040
Things about our dear friend, Mr. Frompson, get us a little bit angry.

931
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,520
I don't know about you, Dark Sakura, but I just, I get so frustrated whenever I read

932
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,640
about what this clown's up to next, and it makes me just want to rant a little bit.

933
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,440
Doesn't it make you want to rant a little bit?

934
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,440
A little.

935
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,480
So I think it's time to bring on the trumpets and the symphonies that declare it be the

936
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:22,800
FUs of the week.

937
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:30,240
My FU of the week goes towards the stupid evil sinus infection from hell.

938
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,240
For anyone who wasn't listening last year, I was sick for about two months with a weird

939
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:43,400
combination of bronchitis and pneumonia, because, um, as the sinus infection, um, well, I have

940
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,280
a sinus infection again, and it's starting off exactly the same way that my last one

941
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,080
did, so now they're pumping me full of antibiotics and all kinds of anti-allergy drugs and all

942
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,080
kinds of crap.

943
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:59,080
It makes me feel absolutely loony and also lose my voice, like, I wake up in the morning

944
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,080
and have no voice.

945
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,080
It's crazy.

946
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,440
And I love to talk, I guess, and so, you know, I'm on a radio show and all that.

947
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,160
And I'm not always sick.

948
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:15,600
FU to Fireboma, too, but, um, FU to the sinus infection, and also, the advice nurse was

949
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:21,320
so funny, she's like, now, you've got chronic fatigue syndrome, it says here on your things,

950
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,240
you're gonna get really tired.

951
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,520
No shit, lady!

952
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,360
But to, to, to their credit, the Kaiser folks were really nice to me and gave me my choice

953
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,800
of antibiotics, so, yeah, I hate it.

954
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,160
You sound like I've been drinking whiskey all night.

955
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,040
I always thought that chronic fatigue syndrome was an inclination to wearing camo, but, you

956
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,200
know, I guess I'm wrong.

957
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,440
No, chronic fatigue syndrome is wearing camo and, you know, smoking the chronic.

958
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,440
Gotcha.

959
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:00,560
Anyways, um, FU to the India casino that we went to last night, because, um, you know,

960
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,800
I think most Indian, actually, this Indian casino seems to be the worst one, it's Thunder

961
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,800
Valley over here, um, I believe it's in Rockland or something, whatever, in California, and,

962
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,800
um, basically, they want to rape you for your money, kind of like, um, yeah, like America

963
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,720
did to the Indians way back when.

964
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,440
But, um, anyways, um, I did leave there, though, only losing 50 cents, so that, that's really

965
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,440
good.

966
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:32,960
Oh, and, by the way, for Rob, FU, the fact that they do not have coconut shrimp.

967
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,200
Um, my FU of the week goes to commuting.

968
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,920
I'm giving the FU to driving this week, who would have thought?

969
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,160
No, my FU goes to commuting and long commutes, and they make me frumpy and sad.

970
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,160
That's it.

971
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:57,320
My FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making a crappy Xbox A60 controller and ruining a

972
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:04,000
brilliant game like Lumines, because you guys can't make a D-pad.

973
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,600
And that's going to do it for, uh, this week's dose of Angst.

974
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,720
At least it's better than the PSP D-pad.

975
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,680
I like the PSP's D-pad, it's just the analog stick, they're the nub, the nipple, that bugs

976
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,680
me.

977
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,760
When I play Lumines on PSP, I have to use the analog stick on the 360, and I'll tell

978
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,560
you, that's not really fun at all.

979
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:30,500
All right, well, speaking of Sony controllers, there's a new one coming out for the PlayStation

980
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,600
3, which was shown at Digital Life, which happened in New York City this weekend.

981
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,600
I'm sure some of our listeners, I know some of them were there, I'm sure we'll get some

982
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,980
calls in the Skyline a little later from the show from our folks who are at Digital Life.

983
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,640
But there were some awards handed out at Digital Life, and I'm, I'm assuming this was Digital

984
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,960
Life and Ziff Davis that handed out these awards, have no idea how they picked them,

985
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,360
but the reason why I say PlayStation 3 is that Sony PlayStation 3 won the award for

986
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,100
Best of Show.

987
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,760
So it seems like things might be on a little bit of a turnaround.

988
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,360
Even better people own some heavy narcotics.

989
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:09,480
Or somebody's on some payroll, I don't know, but Ziff Davis, they don't have a PlayStation

990
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,480
magazine, do they?

991
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,480
Oh, wait, they do!

992
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,880
Okay, but to be fair, they have one for Xbox 360 as well, right?

993
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,600
No, they have computer and video games.

994
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
Whatever.

995
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
I don't give a shit, okay?

996
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,800
The point is, is that, you know, they got this award or whatever, so it seems like in

997
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,880
some folks' mind, maybe things are coming around for Sony, and maybe now Sony is starting

998
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,680
to put out the, it's hard for me to say.

999
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,680
I didn't play PlayStation 3 at Digital Life, I'm going to be relying on the listeners who

1000
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,820
call in later in the show to tell us how, if the PlayStation 3 at Digital Life was deserving

1001
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,820
of this award.

1002
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,420
I can just see it now.

1003
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,360
You know why the PlayStation 3 is awesome?

1004
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,440
Because it smells like money!

1005
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,820
Somehow I doubt that's it.

1006
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,360
What if they had really good games on display there?

1007
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,400
Loki, you don't know, you weren't there.

1008
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,640
Yeah, but I saw the list of games, and probably not.

1009
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,600
Whatever, you know, hey, great.

1010
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,680
Someone wants to spend $600 for the system, more power to you, go pre-order it at EB.

1011
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,160
Oh, wait, can't do that.

1012
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,440
SSJ100Matt says, Sky, they gave out Japanese horrors and HDTVs.

1013
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,740
DJKipplesandbit says, I went to Digital Life, I have no idea how the PS3 won during that

1014
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,740
show.

1015
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:31,560
Let's see, Jaded2006 says, just keep thinking that Sony is going to make a turnaround.

1016
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
Very interesting.

1017
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:38,440
Also, some other awards won at the show, Gaming Hardware, PlayStation 3.

1018
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,600
Gaming Software, Final Fantasy XII.

1019
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,240
For those of you that have to shop for kids this holiday season, the best gift for kids

1020
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,320
was the Fisher-Price SparkArt Easel.

1021
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,680
Is that like a Light Bright?

1022
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,680
I don't know.

1023
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,140
I'm Miss Light Bright.

1024
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:59,240
Best booth also went to Sony, but the hippest booth went to Napster.

1025
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
Remember them?

1026
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,240
Remember Napster?

1027
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,240
They're still around.

1028
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Hey kids, remember Napster?

1029
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,540
There had to have been recreational pharmaceuticals involved in that show.

1030
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,680
I can neither confirm nor deny those statements again.

1031
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,320
We'll hear from the listeners a little later in the show.

1032
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm sure they're already trying to hammer the Skype line to get in, so we'll see.

1033
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,280
And SSJ100Matt is putting out a call.

1034
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
Where's our listener, GrayWolf?

1035
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,480
He's the guy in the forums that's unapologetic in his Sony Phantom, wishing he was here right

1036
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,480
now.

1037
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Who apparently writes in poetic prose form.

1038
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,640
Hey, they're fun to read.

1039
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,760
You know what?

1040
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,280
I encourage the opposing viewpoint to the masses.

1041
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,960
I encourage the opposing viewpoint as long as it's educated.

1042
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,360
And I'm all for a little bit of friendly debate as long as it doesn't resort to name calling.

1043
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:50,600
Well, Sony is apparently pretty happy after this week's pre-order fest at GameStop and

1044
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
EB.

1045
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,640
Of course, in case you didn't hear, they sold out of all the systems that the stores

1046
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,640
got.

1047
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,760
Well, it's not hard to sell out when you're only reserving eight systems at a store.

1048
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:06,520
I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, now now eight was, you know, a larger number.

1049
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,240
Some stores only got like four, I think.

1050
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,680
Some had sixteen, to be fair.

1051
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,680
But, still.

1052
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,680
Eight to sixteen, whatever.

1053
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,840
Anyway, so that's somewhere between twenty, oh, almost about twenty-eight thousand to

1054
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,080
about fifty-eight thousand systems.

1055
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,880
It's not bad.

1056
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,080
Basically, according to the Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson, Dave

1057
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,080
Cracker.

1058
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,760
Yeah, that's Cracker, all right.

1059
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,760
His name's Cracker?

1060
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,560
Well, Cracker or Craker or whatever.

1061
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,720
Listen up, Cracker!

1062
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,720
Anyways.

1063
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,680
Sorry, I had to be said.

1064
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,440
It was within minutes because, you know, obviously they sold out.

1065
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,120
Oh, yeah, because you had the line going, so.

1066
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,680
It reconfirms the excitement and anticipation that we've known since the very first discussion

1067
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,200
of PlayStation 3.

1068
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,780
We're just pleased to see that the reaction from the consumer is as strong as we anticipated

1069
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,860
it would be.

1070
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,200
It helps validate everything that we've been seeing up to this point.

1071
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,240
So if I released a system with only one unit in the United States, it'd be like, we sold

1072
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,960
everything in one second.

1073
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,040
It's awesome.

1074
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:14,600
My rebuttal to Sony is, everyone just go read VG Cats, look at the last comic, it perfectly

1075
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,880
illustrates it.

1076
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,160
And you know what, I'm sure we'll be covering this a little bit later on, but I don't think

1077
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,280
a lot of those people were keeping those systems.

1078
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,400
It's more like, hey, you know what, the Xbox 360 was being able to be sold for twice retail

1079
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,400
on eBay.

1080
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,400
Hmm.

1081
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,200
I'll tell you what, because I've got a PlayStation 3 pre-ordered.

1082
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,840
I know, traitor.

1083
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,840
My husband ordered.

1084
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,440
No, you're just a gaming whore.

1085
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,200
No, he ordered one and didn't pre-order a Wii and I'm pissed off at him.

1086
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,000
Yeah, F you.

1087
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Anyway.

1088
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,840
But the thing is, is that, you know, like if we decide that we hate it, which I probably

1089
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,720
will, except I want to play White Nights, but I could just autograph it and put it on

1090
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,760
eBay for a million, then, you know, I'd pay for the rest of my college and set up my own

1091
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,840
business and that type of thing.

1092
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,840
I guess.

1093
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
I don't know.

1094
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,320
The Dark Soccer Autographed Edition PS3.

1095
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:11,200
Well, also, I mean, of course, the Wii did also sell out as well at GameStop and EB,

1096
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,560
and I believe each store is getting at least 32, well, they're getting upwards to 32 systems,

1097
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,960
so about, I think it ended up being about twice what they were getting with the PlayStation

1098
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,960
3.

1099
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,360
I think the pro Sony side of this a little bit, you know, there are, I would believe

1100
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,680
there are 50,000 people in this country that excited about the PlayStation 3.

1101
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,760
I mean, for tech junkies, it is a Blu-ray player.

1102
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
It's pretty cheap.

1103
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,520
That's pretty exciting.

1104
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,080
Maybe there's, you know, I would believe that there's that many fanboys.

1105
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,480
I don't think there's any, it's just, you know, it's hard to go, ooh, it's just, it's

1106
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,800
this ravaging success when you consider there's really only eight PlayStation 3s at the store

1107
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,240
to be preserved, I don't know.

1108
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,240
We'll see a little more towards November 17th, but then again, like I've always been saying,

1109
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,000
is launch really that important?

1110
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,680
PlayStation 2 didn't wow me at launch, but it really won me over about a year later.

1111
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,080
Well, I don't know.

1112
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,240
Maybe by a year later, they will have actual systems in the stores.

1113
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,240
All right.

1114
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,800
I want to ask, let me go talk really quick while he's still here, because he's going

1115
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,800
to be leaving in a little bit.

1116
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,360
I wanted to ask you, you actually camped out for the Wii pre-order, right?

1117
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,360
I totally did.

1118
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,360
Tell us about that experience.

1119
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,360
How did that go?

1120
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,360
What time did you get there?

1121
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
Who else was there?

1122
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,740
My roommate decided we were going to go do the Wii pre-order, because we really, really

1123
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,120
want that system after playing it.

1124
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,920
Because unlike some folks, I actually have to report to work at eight o'clock in the

1125
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,920
morning.

1126
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,920
Yeah, whatever.

1127
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,280
I can go whenever I want.

1128
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:41,960
And so we got up about 3.45 AM to go to our local GameStop, and he went a little bit earlier

1129
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:47,600
than I did, but I arrived about a little past five, and there were already 16 people ahead

1130
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:54,920
of me, which was insane to me, because I didn't think people were as stupid as I am.

1131
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,920
Then again, this is the Bay Area.

1132
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,920
This is Tech Home.

1133
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,920
Yeah, that's true.

1134
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:05,520
But I live in the sunset, which is dead, so it was still shocking to me.

1135
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,520
And then more people started showing up, and around, I would say about maybe six, we had

1136
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,840
a good 30 people in line to help pass the time.

1137
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,840
I played clubhouse games, which is OK.

1138
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:22,520
And then I'd say about 9.30, we had a little over 70 people in line.

1139
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,740
What's great about that is that the store opens at 10.

1140
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:31,920
So at about 9.30, 9.40, an employee came out, and those people who had been there since,

1141
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,440
I would say about seven or eight, the people that were towards the back, they got told

1142
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:42,000
that they would not be pre-ordering any systems today, because they only got 32 in.

1143
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,040
So I thought it was kind of jerky that the employees waited that long to come out and

1144
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,440
tell the people in the back of the line that they weren't going to get anything.

1145
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,960
To their credit, though, corporate probably didn't tell them until then.

1146
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,560
They probably didn't get an email until overnight or something.

1147
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,600
That's not true.

1148
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,600
That's not true.

1149
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
Yeah.

1150
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
They knew a few days in advance.

1151
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
Yeah.

1152
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,600
I knew about them.

1153
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Poopy!

1154
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,600
They're just jerks.

1155
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:07,080
But anyway, so they let us in two at a time to pre-order our systems, and I mean, it went

1156
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,080
pretty smooth.

1157
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,040
We got a list of stuff we could pre-order with the system while we were standing in

1158
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,160
line, put the $50 down, and then we were on our way.

1159
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,280
It was really nicely handled, except for that whole not coming out until 9.30 to tell the

1160
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,480
people in the back of the line, because, I mean, you've got 40 people in line that aren't

1161
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,640
getting systems, and we saw the employees get there about 9 and 8.30, so these people

1162
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,400
are just waiting there, waiting for somebody to tell them that they have to go home.

1163
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,180
What types of people did you see in line?

1164
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:40,080
Was it all gaming nerds like you, or did you have the older parents?

1165
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,240
I'm not a gaming nerd.

1166
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,160
You are, but that's beside the point.

1167
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,720
Were there any older people in the line?

1168
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,720
Were there excited girls from college?

1169
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:57,440
I saw maybe three girls, and then the front of the line comprised of scrawny white guys

1170
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:06,020
and Asian guys, and then the back of the line were the older parents that maybe didn't realize

1171
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:12,520
that they'd have to get there really early to get the systems preordered, so it was a

1172
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,520
nice mix.

1173
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,840
I'm just asking that because I'm curious, because Nintendo is trying to reach everybody,

1174
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,840
but is it still the...

1175
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:23,880
They're not going to reach everybody with a preorder that won't last longer than 10

1176
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,880
minutes.

1177
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:30,160
I still don't think that preordering the Wii is all that big of a deal, just because Nintendo

1178
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,120
loves us, and you know they're making lots of them.

1179
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:41,360
I just wanted the security, plus I kind of plan on maybe camping for the PS3, so I didn't

1180
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:50,800
want to try to get to a nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd eBay, eBay, eBay.

1181
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,800
And that's that.

1182
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,800
All right.

1183
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,800
Well, thanks for sharing your story.

1184
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,800
We appreciate it.

1185
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,800
That was very nice of you.

1186
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,080
All right.

1187
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:01,280
How about some more... Anything else you want to say on PS3 preorders?

1188
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,280
Okay.

1189
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:09,840
Well, I mean, there are going to be more preorders, I'm sure, around the world and stuff.

1190
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:15,680
The whole thing is it's going to be very hard to come by, just very, very hard, so if you

1191
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:21,560
are looking to get one, try to get it as soon as possible, because it is going to be like

1192
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,000
the Xbox 360 was last year, and you might end up having to buy it on eBay if you really

1193
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,280
want it or at day one.

1194
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,960
And to be honest, I mean, I would wait, I mean, if it were me, I would wait just because

1195
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,560
a lot of the launch games you may be looking forward to are delayed until next year, so

1196
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:43,160
just kind of keep that in mind when you're thinking about preordering it.

1197
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,680
All right.

1198
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,560
Let's go on to some more gaming news.

1199
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:54,960
Well, speaking of, back to the whole Sony camp, there is actually one thing that I am

1200
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,120
personally excited about coming out on PSP, and that's After Burner.

1201
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,520
Sega did confirm they have a deal with Planet Moon Studios to do a PSP version, a new one

1202
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:13,640
of After Burner, so if anyone who was into the original, hey, and there's a quote actually

1203
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:20,860
from the CEO of Planet Moon, most importantly, it's approximately 9,000% more portable than

1204
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,740
the original arcade cabinet.

1205
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:28,500
That just struck me as a stupid quote, but anyway, it's going to be called After Burner

1206
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,120
Black Falcon.

1207
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:36,920
It will have 19 officially licensed customizable planes, a single player modem, and Wi-Fi multiplayer,

1208
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,040
and they're slated for spring 2007.

1209
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,960
And I'd like to mention we also mentioned that back on episode 200.

1210
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,960
That was also one of the big stories we came out with, so I see one of those under the

1211
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,960
radar things.

1212
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,960
Yes.

1213
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,240
Well, it's been confirmed, you're not a liar, Loki.

1214
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,240
Way to go.

1215
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,240
I know.

1216
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,520
Full auto 2 on PSP, March 14th, 2007, heard it here first.

1217
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,280
Now if that's the one that doesn't happen, I'm going to laugh my ass off just to share.

1218
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,280
Okay.

1219
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,800
Speaking of Sony things, Eurogamer got a really in-depth look at PlayStation 3, the interface

1220
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
and the online.

1221
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Check it out.

1222
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,400
They got a pretty in-depth article over at Eurogamer.net.

1223
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,000
Some of the highlights from their tour, of course, the PlayStation 3 is going to be using

1224
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,280
what's called the cross media bar.

1225
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,840
So if you've played the PSP at all, you're already familiar with how the PS3 is going

1226
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:31,600
to be set up, which is kind of interesting that they have that very similar layout between

1227
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
the two.

1228
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,720
It kind of makes me wonder if the Wii and DS are going to be similar like that too.

1229
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,880
I don't know.

1230
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,080
They talk about how you're going to have web browsing on the PlayStation 3, something that

1231
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,000
the Xbox 360 does not have currently.

1232
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,560
Hopefully it will have better flash support and streaming media support.

1233
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,560
Hopefully.

1234
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,560
We'll see.

1235
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,920
Yes, sir, I would imagine it can run this stuff.

1236
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,860
There's the friends bar and there's different icons there.

1237
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,120
Your signed in friends show their own icons on the bar there.

1238
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:03,280
And then other icons would be those that are managing the PlayStation network account.

1239
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,560
There's a master account and associated accounts.

1240
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,040
So I'm assuming that's for like a family set up there.

1241
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,920
So you could also like with the master account limit what your kids do on their accounts

1242
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:17,560
and how much they can spend on the PlayStation store, which is another section of the bar.

1243
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:22,000
And of course we all know SingStar is going to be huge on the PlayStation store right

1244
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,140
out the gate.

1245
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,920
So if you want to check out more on the tour of online and what to expect there, check

1246
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,920
it out at Eurogamer.net.

1247
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,200
And you know what's funny is the Sony store that they're going to have on there, no point

1248
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,200
system like the Microsoft and Nintendo teams are doing.

1249
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,780
It's just going to be dollars or your currency.

1250
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,120
So that's kind of interesting I thought, I don't know.

1251
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,880
But there's a comment from Mike in the chat room.

1252
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,240
Loki is the only one that likes Full Auto.

1253
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,240
And maybe that's true.

1254
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,300
Maybe that's why no one else has been reporting on it, because you're the only person that

1255
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,200
likes Full Auto.

1256
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,200
So I didn't care for After Burner, you know, I still reported on it.

1257
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,200
To be honest, Oblivion, it was a great game, but eh, so whatever.

1258
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,880
Oh, I don't know about that.

1259
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,160
Oblivion, I mean Oblivion is more than a great game.

1260
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,520
I don't know about your, listen, Full Auto 2 is going to be fun with that one.

1261
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,120
Granted it's exactly the same as Full Auto 1, but it's still fun.

1262
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,120
Whatever.

1263
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,900
Anyway, it's just to hold you over until they come out with a new Twisted Metal.

1264
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,440
That's all that matters right there.

1265
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,360
One thing that was kind of interesting, and we talked about it a little bit before about

1266
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:33,820
Sony and the rumor that XFire is going to be teaming up with them for some online partnership

1267
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:34,820
and stuff.

1268
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,920
And Sony came out and said, no, no, no, that's not true.

1269
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,920
That's only for one game.

1270
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,740
Actually, no, it is true.

1271
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,040
It actually is going to be happening.

1272
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,840
It was officially announced.

1273
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,880
They're going to be using the middleware, or they're going to be kind of teaming up

1274
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:54,280
for a middleware solution that's going to be an add-on to the current, I guess PS3 friends

1275
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,960
list and chatting that they're going to have in the actual PS3.

1276
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,560
So this is going to be a little bit kind of tying into that, you know, being able to play

1277
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,200
games on PC versus the PlayStation 3 and stuff like that.

1278
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,880
So as mentioned before, the first title they'll actually be using that will be the new Untold

1279
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,920
Legends game.

1280
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,280
So it should be interesting.

1281
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,280
See how that turns out.

1282
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,280
I like XFire.

1283
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,520
I actually, I really like XFire.

1284
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,480
I think it's a pretty nice little app, even if MTV does own it, I really like it.

1285
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,640
It's a cool little application.

1286
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,080
So that should be interesting.

1287
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:30,040
I could be some brownie points for the PlayStation 3 as far as I'm concerned.

1288
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:36,240
It's going to need as many brownie points as it can get, but as far as the delay circumstances,

1289
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:42,160
there's actually a rumor that came out, one of the Spanish gaming sites called Meristations

1290
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:47,840
said that Kudaragi warned there would be a shortage of PS3 stock in Japan and North America

1291
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,440
and that Europe would have to wait even longer than they already are, but a Sony spokesperson

1292
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:57,080
has said that that was categorically not true.

1293
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,360
I love how they always put modifiers on.

1294
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,200
He was eating crayons at the time.

1295
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,200
It's okay.

1296
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Exactly.

1297
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,200
He was confused.

1298
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,280
He hasn't run any media briefings since the Tokyo game show.

1299
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:13,400
That's because they had him chained to his jungle gym in his house so that he wouldn't

1300
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:18,360
go run out into traffic and die because they need him.

1301
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,640
To spread weird rumors.

1302
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:26,600
Well, at any rate, Sony is actually planning on shipping 6 million PS3 units on a global

1303
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,720
scale by the end of the 2007 fiscal year.

1304
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,720
Cool.

1305
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,480
All right.

1306
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,480
They can plan it.

1307
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,360
Whether it happens or not, hey.

1308
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,000
Do you think there will be further delays?

1309
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Despite all this?

1310
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,520
I don't doubt it.

1311
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,720
Possibly if they run into hardware problems.

1312
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,840
If they run into the overheating problems or anything like that.

1313
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,800
Something that they didn't foresee.

1314
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,640
Well, they actually remember all those issues they had with the first model PlayStation

1315
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,640
2.

1316
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,600
Although, amazingly enough, I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2 and I've had

1317
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:06,000
it for years and it hasn't had any problems, but a lot of them were having issues with

1318
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,680
coming off track, overheating.

1319
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,200
I'm seeing there actually being lots of issues for the PS3.

1320
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,760
All right.

1321
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,160
Let's go to some release dates.

1322
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,800
These are things that are coming out next week.

1323
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,840
For the most part, we know these aren't going to get delayed.

1324
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,200
Although, hell, even sometimes things get delayed at the last minute.

1325
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,320
In Japan, you can expect these games to be coming out very soon.

1326
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:31,800
On the PlayStation 2, October 19th, Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is out.

1327
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,440
A game called Gift Prism is coming out.

1328
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:41,720
It's from Syro Interactive, a very anime-ish looking game, but it's an adventure-type game.

1329
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,280
It's also coming in a limited edition.

1330
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,240
Everybody's Tennis is also coming out.

1331
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,120
The Korean version actually is coming out on October 19th.

1332
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:54,160
Sudoku Master on the PlayStation 2 should also be noted that various Wild Arms games

1333
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:59,000
are coming out in Sony's version of the best hits, so you can get that cheaper through

1334
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,040
your importer if you are looking for games such as that.

1335
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:10,320
Coming out on the DS, several games in the Kodomo no Tami no Yomi Kikashi series are

1336
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,320
coming out.

1337
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,200
I'm not sure what type of games those are.

1338
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,200
Children's something.

1339
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,200
Yeah.

1340
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,200
It's some type of children's game there.

1341
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,200
It's just a miscellaneous.

1342
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:21,440
It's by Starfish who creates these games.

1343
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,440
Several games in that series.

1344
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,240
It's pretty awesome.

1345
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:28,120
Yeah, if I understood any of what I just said, yeah, it would be pretty awesome.

1346
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:35,240
Well, anyways, but actually the US is going to be getting quite a bit of stuff as well.

1347
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:41,440
This week is a very good week for games, so lots of good stuff, including of course Bully,

1348
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,360
the game that's been getting so much controversy lately on PlayStation 2.

1349
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,680
We have Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception on the PSP.

1350
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,680
Get your flight sim on there.

1351
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,400
If you're looking to get your flight sim on on the PC, Microsoft's Flight Simulator X

1352
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:05,360
is going to be coming out, as well as Contact on the DS, Destroy All Humans 2 on PlayStation

1353
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,360
2 and Xbox.

1354
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,080
The first one was really fun, so I'm looking forward to playing this one.

1355
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:13,200
Family Guy on PlayStation 2, PSP, and Xbox.

1356
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,320
That one actually looks pretty good.

1357
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:20,320
I kind of thought that was going to be a crappy port of a TV show, but it looks pretty good.

1358
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,680
And then 10 Dogs, Dalmatian, and Friends.

1359
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:29,600
Why this late in the game for those that were too lazy to unlock the Dalmatian in the first

1360
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,600
one?

1361
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,600
Not lazy, you just had to find the hat.

1362
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:40,600
Anyways, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on the 360, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent

1363
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,600
also on the 360.

1364
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:48,360
I know Sims 2 Pets will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and DS, as well as SpongeBob Creature from

1365
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,120
Krusty Krab on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

1366
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,120
Yippee.

1367
01:12:53,120 --> 01:13:02,200
And then finally, on the PC, we have Battlefield 2142, and that is going to be coming out as

1368
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,360
well.

1369
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,160
But you know what?

1370
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,920
Maybe you just don't have to tell them to go buy a game like that.

1371
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,440
So we are going to give one away.

1372
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,800
And how might you be able to do this, to enter in?

1373
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,360
It's actually pretty simple.

1374
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,040
All you have to do, and this contest will be running until Wednesday, is go to orange

1375
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:27,160
launch radio dot com slash BF2142, or Battlefield 2142.

1376
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:32,280
Just simply enter the contest there, and there will be a random drawing on Wednesday, and

1377
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,360
we'll be announcing it in part A of episode 205.

1378
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,600
And they'll be able to get that right away.

1379
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,040
Yes, they'll be able to get it right away.

1380
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,240
It's actually a digital distribution thing.

1381
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:46,200
It's a digital download code, so you'll be able to download it straight to your PC.

1382
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,160
So I look forward to that, and I look forward to giving a full review about the game next

1383
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,160
week.

1384
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,680
Now, doesn't Desperate Housewives come out this week?

1385
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,480
Because I noticed in our chat room, somebody had said they just saw a commercial on VH1.

1386
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,480
Who said that?

1387
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,800
I think that was last week, to be honest.

1388
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,800
Was it?

1389
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,800
I think it was.

1390
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,720
Oh, JV Mon says, a commercial for the Desperate Housewives video game just aired on VH1, which

1391
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:10,680
means someone's watching Flavor of Love.

1392
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,740
Same shame.

1393
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,520
His career should have stayed gone when public happened.

1394
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,520
Or to name calling.

1395
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:22,200
I don't know, my attention was diverted elsewhere on the PC, whether it be Warcraft, Final Fantasy

1396
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,040
11, Civilization, one of those other games.

1397
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,300
I might have to go back and check out some more.

1398
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:30,840
I just hear gelatinous cubes, and I think of all of my old D&D games.

1399
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:36,120
But also coming out is Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent on Xbox 360.

1400
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:41,320
A few other things to look forward to, by the way, is the new Blade Dancer game on PSP.

1401
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:48,400
Metal Slug, King of Fighters, Neo-Geo Battle Colosseum, more stuff.

1402
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,840
All right.

1403
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Down the line.

1404
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:58,760
Have fun, you folks over in Europe, playing your renamed version of Bully.

1405
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,760
What is up with that?

1406
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,760
I still don't get that.

1407
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,680
I guess Bully must have a real negative context overseas or something.

1408
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,920
Could someone please enlighten me from overseas?

1409
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,920
What's wrong with the word Bully?

1410
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,640
I don't know.

1411
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,960
This issue has been going back and forth and I'm getting to the point where I just don't

1412
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
care anymore.

1413
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,480
I guess you could call this a follow-up.

1414
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,400
Last week we said something about how GameStop was tooting their horn that the Wii demo kiosks

1415
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,200
were going to be exclusive to their store.

1416
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,240
Well guess what?

1417
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:31,760
Nintendo of America says, uh-uh, playable Wii setups will be available at a variety

1418
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,200
of retail outlets.

1419
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,360
We expect that anyone who wants to try Wii will be able to through multiple different

1420
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,360
methods.

1421
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,720
In addition to retail outlets, Wii will be playable at a number of mall tours throughout

1422
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:46,720
the company, the nationwide Nintendo Fusion Tour, and other grassroots consumer events,

1423
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:52,280
which means Loki was misinformed about this when he told us this a couple months ago in

1424
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,720
his big scoop when the sales people were there.

1425
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,960
GameStop was misinformed on this.

1426
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,360
Part of me is starting to wonder if Nintendo really knows what they're doing until the

1427
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,720
last minute on these demo kiosks.

1428
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,120
I don't know, but whatever.

1429
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,120
Who knows?

1430
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,960
Maybe it's just stuff changes every day.

1431
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:10,480
Now Nintendo has actually clarified that retailers will actually either be getting a traditional

1432
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,160
pre-built interactive kiosk with the TV, Wii, and controllers, or just the Wii and controllers

1433
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,560
that they can set up themselves.

1434
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,560
That's pretty low-tech.

1435
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,300
Hey, whatever works.

1436
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:27,580
Maybe the whole thing, you know, I know this is getting into another story, but maybe the

1437
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:32,840
whole thing has to do with interference from lighting and maybe not being able to control

1438
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,720
it, and that might have something to do with it.

1439
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,840
I thought that was a bunch of BS, but whatever.

1440
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
Who knows?

1441
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,840
Whatever.

1442
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,440
It's just speculation right now.

1443
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:49,180
Well, an interesting rumor has come out about the Wii console is that it might actually

1444
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:53,280
be running Linux already.

1445
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,480
So for those folks that love to install Linux on new things, whether it be the Nintendo

1446
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:06,600
DS, the PSP, a toaster, a Billy Bass, whatever the hell, you know, too bad Nintendo beat

1447
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,600
you to it.

1448
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,600
Yes, exactly.

1449
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:21,640
Apparently a Nintendo insider who blogs under the internet moniker Kiyoshi Saruwatari claims

1450
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:28,640
that the Wii console will run an open source Linux OS, and of course it hasn't been confirmed

1451
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:34,520
and it's purely speculation right now, but it's basically, you know, used for the back

1452
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,900
end of, you know, using the software for, you know, porting stuff in there like the

1453
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,360
Opera browser and stuff like that.

1454
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:47,160
And it says it will be closed and will only allow signed code, but of course, you know,

1455
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,640
anyone that remembers that kind of stuff knows that people will break that pretty quick.

1456
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,640
Good.

1457
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,840
Use it to break the region lock.

1458
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,120
That's the first thing I want you Linux nerds to work on if this is indeed true and the

1459
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,480
Wii already has it on there.

1460
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,080
I want you to work on the region lock in case there's, you know, Oh and Don for the, you

1461
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,080
know, Wii.

1462
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,400
I want that shit imported ASAP.

1463
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Thank you.

1464
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,400
Could you imagine Oh and Don on the Wii?

1465
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,600
I'm thinking about it and I'm wearing a warm smile.

1466
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,240
Well, as far as other things that are...

1467
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,240
Hold on.

1468
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,240
I'd like to...

1469
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,240
Sorry.

1470
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,240
And I hate having to read these.

1471
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,520
Bad transition.

1472
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,520
Five points from Gryffindor.

1473
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,520
Hey.

1474
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,520
Anyways.

1475
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,160
I was on my way to a very wonderful transition.

1476
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:33,840
And this will be the last story that we have from Kiyoshi Sarawati because apparently the

1477
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,960
whole thing was a practical joke made up by him to get spread around the world.

1478
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,560
So that will be nixed from the podcast.

1479
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,560
Thank you very much.

1480
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,080
So you just made up last five minutes.

1481
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,080
Oh no.

1482
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,080
I'm keeping that in.

1483
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,080
Hey.

1484
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,720
I am reporting the news.

1485
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,720
Okay.

1486
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,480
I said it was purely speculation and this is what this guy said.

1487
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,480
It's all his fault.

1488
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,480
Not mine.

1489
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,480
I just...

1490
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,480
I just report the news.

1491
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,480
I think that's funny.

1492
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,480
Don't shoot the messenger.

1493
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,840
I think that's really freaking funny.

1494
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,840
There's five minutes in my life.

1495
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,840
I won't get back.

1496
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,800
Speaking of things that I also think are funny is not really the story.

1497
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:16,160
Nintendo has announced a launch of Live Move, which is a development tool to make it easy

1498
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,440
to produce titles for the Wii easier and faster.

1499
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:28,240
It was made by, I guess that would be iLive, an artificial intelligence specialist.

1500
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:35,940
At any rate, it's supposed to help allow a developer to train the Wii remote just by

1501
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,940
performing motions.

1502
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:43,640
To quote on here from iLive's chairman Wei Yan, Live Move will allow the game industry

1503
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:48,120
to move away from indirect digital control to more natural analog control for the first

1504
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,120
time.

1505
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:59,120
Ganyel Takeda, who's Nintendo's senior MD of integrated research and development, basically

1506
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,760
said when Nintendo's development team saw Live Move, we instantly recognized how easy

1507
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,280
it would greatly increase our ability to explore and experiment with new concepts and make

1508
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,360
our lives easier.

1509
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:15,720
So I'm looking to see what they can come up with.

1510
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,780
Another quote on here that I think is really cool is, this revolutionary tool liberates

1511
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:22,960
the imaginations of game creators, which I think actually the whole concept of having

1512
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:30,360
something that you can use free motion to actually program with I think really just

1513
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:36,120
links very well to the whole mission behind the Wii.

1514
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:41,320
You have innovative games, but you have innovative development going with it.

1515
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,080
Maybe some developers that want to see what's coming up in Nintendo's world might want to

1516
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:51,380
check out the Nintendo Space World Show, of course the Nintendo World Show for short.

1517
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:57,880
It's going to be November 3rd in Nagoya and November 12th in Osaka.

1518
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,720
That was from Nintendo's official Japan site.

1519
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,020
So check it out if you're over in Japan and want to check out what Nintendo's up to because

1520
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:10,440
remember they don't do Tokyo Game Show, so this is kind of their version of that.

1521
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:16,920
There will be of course hands-on Wii demos and new DS games.

1522
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,960
Start saving those pennies quick.

1523
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,240
Some interesting stuff that they're doing with the GameCube version of Twilight Princess

1524
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,920
in Japan is only being offered online, kind of similar to what they do with Electroplankton

1525
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,920
over here.

1526
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,320
The main reason Nintendo is doing this is to avoid both versions of the game in stores

1527
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,800
at the same time because of the Wii launch.

1528
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,560
They would much rather see the Wii Zelda sell than the GameCube version and that wouldn't

1529
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,520
be a guarantee if the two versions are on the same shelf.

1530
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,160
There is no information on whether this same procedure will be passed on to Europe and

1531
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,160
the U.S. as well.

1532
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,160
Interesting.

1533
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,000
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see if they do that in the U.S. as well.

1534
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I don't think they will.

1535
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,040
I think there's a lot more demand for the old GameCube games here.

1536
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,480
I think there's a lot of folks that buy the earlier generations of consoles because they're

1537
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,080
cheaper so I think they'll still be on shelves out here.

1538
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,840
You know what, some people might not want to use the Wii to play Zelda.

1539
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,980
Well, wasn't there an old story that said you could plug in the old GameCube controller

1540
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,960
and use that on the Wii version still?

1541
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,960
I don't know.

1542
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,960
I don't remember.

1543
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:20,960
Maybe.

1544
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,920
For me, I had a discussion with Dan about this not too long ago.

1545
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:29,000
He said that he's actually thinking about just picking it up on GameCube anyway instead

1546
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
of on Wii.

1547
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,160
Just for the hell of it or just because of the controls?

1548
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:38,240
The control, instead of a few things changed from the E3 demo version that I wasn't too

1549
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:45,840
happy with, like not being able to use the remote actually for the sort at all, you have

1550
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,840
to slash.

1551
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,840
Oh, weird.

1552
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:55,680
And I was like, nah, I don't like that so we're probably just getting it on GameCube.

1553
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,920
Or you might just have both because you're a whore for Link like that, right?

1554
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:01,920
Maybe?

1555
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:02,920
Well, I don't know.

1556
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,920
I didn't play Wind Waker.

1557
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,960
I refuse to play Wind Waker.

1558
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:09,260
Well that's a different, that's fake cartoony Link.

1559
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:12,080
That's not the real deal.

1560
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,480
Alright well that is about going to wrap it up for our part A but you know, over the past

1561
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,600
few weeks we have not been able to end part A of Orange Lounge Radio until we get to some

1562
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,780
DDR previews and that's what we're going to do right now.

1563
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:29,560
We're going to take a look at some new tracks here from DDR Universe and DDR UltraMix 4.

1564
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:33,080
These are new Dance Dance Revolution games coming out from Konami a little bit later this

1565
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,200
year, possibly early next year.

1566
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:39,720
We don't have a firm date on DDR Universe yet but we know sometime this winter the game

1567
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,720
is going to be out.

1568
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,520
So far December 2nd but that could always change.

1569
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,200
That could always be changed, absolutely.

1570
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,960
But it doesn't stop us from showing you some of the new mix by Jondi and Spesh and we're

1571
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:55,440
going to hear the long mix right here on the DDR Sneak Peaks here on Orange Lounge Radio

1572
01:23:55,440 --> 01:24:16,160
coming to DDR Universe.

1573
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:39,260
Alright there we go.
