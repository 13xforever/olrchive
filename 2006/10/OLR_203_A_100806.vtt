00:00.000 --> 00:20.320
Today, October 8th, 2006, rumors about next-gen sales at GameStop fly around the Internet,

00:20.320 --> 00:32.760
angry NBA Live fans write a letter to EA, and a popular BS mascot moves to the PSP.

00:32.760 --> 00:36.760
Hello everybody out there on the Internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
Radio.

00:37.760 --> 00:42.800
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.960
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.960 --> 00:44.960
You might know me as Sky.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.200
Joining me, not tonight, is Dark Sakura.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.560
She actually has the night off.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.400
Unfortunately, she had a funeral she had to go to today, so we hope all is well with her

00:53.400 --> 00:54.840
and her family.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.840
We do have, though, tonight, Loki joining us.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.840
Tech master Loki.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.640
Yes, and I'm wiping the salt off of this laptop here.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.320
Were you having a late-night snack just before, I shouldn't say late-night, I guess more late-afternoon

01:05.320 --> 01:07.520
snack before starting the show here?

01:07.520 --> 01:10.080
Yes, McDonald's french fries.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.640
That would definitely be salty.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.040
That would be.

01:13.040 --> 01:17.600
I'm sure it's going to be an interesting program tonight as it is just Loki and just myself

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
here in studio.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.360
We have no third guest, no Miklotov, no Drew Nami, no other people really were available

01:24.360 --> 01:25.360
tonight.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.680
As somebody had suggested, we could do a third co-host through Skype, but I don't know.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.840
There's something about you sitting here in studio and Jamie when she's here sitting in

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
the studio.

01:33.840 --> 01:34.840
Somebody suggested that was a stupid idea.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.880
Well, no, I don't know.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.040
It might be something to try in the future, but just for right now, it's a little difficult.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.580
You can't get that same.

01:41.580 --> 01:46.000
For me, I know there's a lot of shows, podcasts out there that do the Skype co-host thing,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.560
and if it works for your show, awesome.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.840
That's a great way to get a variety of opinions, but this is just the way we've been doing

01:52.840 --> 01:57.480
it for four years, and in the nine years I've been doing radio, I've never had a co-host

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
who wasn't in the studio.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.280
I'll just start answering you with a ten-second delay.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.400
How about that?

02:03.400 --> 02:07.360
I guess if the person you're co-hosting with on Skype has a good connection, it's not so

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
bad, but we'll see.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.840
We have some pretty good connections with our callers, and we will be hearing from them

02:11.840 --> 02:13.160
a little later on in the program.

02:13.160 --> 02:19.120
Of course, our chat room, always the ever-present, tonight, third guest, usually it's the fourth

02:19.120 --> 02:20.240
guest, but tonight they're the third guest.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.960
They get promoted.

02:21.960 --> 02:26.360
I guess our chat room is the co-host substitute tonight, so if you want to join our chat room

02:26.360 --> 02:31.400
and you are listening live here on Sunday night, head on over to www.orangelaunchradio.com

02:31.400 --> 02:32.680
and click on Chat.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.160
All right, let's get into games and start it off, Loki, talking about how was your gaming

02:37.160 --> 02:38.160
week?

02:38.160 --> 02:40.080
My gaming week was great.

02:40.080 --> 02:47.920
I played a lot of Saints Row, and I finally got the 20-hour achievement for that game.

02:47.920 --> 02:53.640
It's fun, and there's actually a whole section of the game I really hadn't explored yet.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.760
It's just a really fun game, so I've been playing that, actually playing through some

02:56.760 --> 02:59.040
of the storyline.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.040
It's one of those games that you are allowed to cheat in it, but you can't get achievement

03:03.040 --> 03:07.720
points doing it, so it feels good to actually play through the game, and to be honest, the

03:07.720 --> 03:12.440
game's not that hard anyways, at least not the part that I'm at.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.600
So I don't know, it's pretty fun.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.320
And the storyline, I like the storyline so far to it, so yeah, it's worth checking out.

03:18.320 --> 03:23.240
Other than that, I've been actually, well, I've been trying to play some PlayStation

03:23.240 --> 03:25.040
2 games, but that didn't happen this week.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.960
I have them all lined up to play next week.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.240
Even games I shouldn't be having to play next week, I will be playing next week.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.960
I see, okay.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.640
But yeah, so lots of good stuff.

03:40.640 --> 03:44.040
There's a lot of people out there that develop games that really leak stuff to the internet

03:44.040 --> 03:46.540
pretty early, so.

03:46.540 --> 03:51.680
And then, of course, just the usual, real quick comment from the chatroom, joshi16 says

03:51.680 --> 03:54.120
the ending to Saints sucks.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.680
Have you gotten that far where you saw the ending?

03:55.680 --> 03:57.080
No, but I don't care.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.080
So what if the ending sucks?

03:58.080 --> 03:59.080
Big deal.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.600
I mean, if your main character doesn't talk, so how great can it be?

04:02.600 --> 04:06.080
I mean, it's just, they should have him do a monologue, that'd be hilarious, because

04:06.080 --> 04:08.400
he's just standing there going, doo doo doo.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.160
You know, a lot of video game endings suck now that I think about it.

04:12.160 --> 04:17.040
It's like Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto's ending sucked, and you beat it so you can

04:17.040 --> 04:20.840
have lots of rockets at your crib, so you can go blow up shit.

04:20.840 --> 04:25.800
That's what I did today, I was, you know, playing, and I blew up cop cars and stuff,

04:25.800 --> 04:30.280
and then I got on the train tracks, and I blew up the L train, and the train fell down,

04:30.280 --> 04:33.760
and usually you can't jump off the tracks without dying, but since there's a big train

04:33.760 --> 04:37.940
pile up next to the tracks, I just jumped on the trains and ran down, and it's fun.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.440
It's fun running around hitting people.

04:39.440 --> 04:44.280
I am looking for, though, because there is an exploit in the game where if you find an

04:44.280 --> 04:49.960
armored car, you can actually take it back to your, you know, crib or whatever, and store

04:49.960 --> 04:53.540
it in your garage, and once you've stored a car in your garage, you basically can respawn

04:53.540 --> 04:55.120
the car numerous times.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.320
Well, the one armored car has money in it, so you respawn it, blow it up, respawn it,

04:59.320 --> 05:02.720
blow it up, and you keep taking the money out of it, so it's a little bit of an exploit,

05:02.720 --> 05:07.760
but not technically cheating, because you're playing with the game's physics.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.200
If that's their mistake, that's fine.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.720
That's why the whole duping glitch in Oblivion, not really cheating, because it was there.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.720
I did not put a code in.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.400
And now the chat room is talking about video game endings, right?

05:19.400 --> 05:23.360
And Jeremy Todd once says, who cares if the ending sucks, if the whole other part of the

05:23.360 --> 05:25.600
game is good, who gives a shit about the ending?

05:25.600 --> 05:30.000
And Joshi16 kind of seems to follow up with that, with saying in response to his comment

05:30.000 --> 05:32.320
earlier, I was just saying, I still like the game.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.160
So what if the ending sucked, huh?

05:34.160 --> 05:38.200
You know what, and if the ending sucks, you just continue playing in multiplayer.

05:38.200 --> 05:43.840
And then of course SmartAss starts its mouth off in the chat room here.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
Where is it?

05:44.840 --> 05:47.960
Oh, Joshi16 says the ending to Pac-Man sucks also.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.960
Didn't I just restart?

05:49.960 --> 05:52.440
No, you get a half-board at the very end.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.440
You can actually look it up.

05:53.440 --> 05:58.480
I was on a Wikipedia marathon this week, reading about different video games on Wikipedia,

05:58.480 --> 06:01.400
and one of them I was reading about was Pac-Man, and they actually have a screenshot of the

06:01.400 --> 06:08.480
256th or 255th board, the one that crashes out the machine, and it's only like a half-board.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.600
It's funky looking.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.600
Look it up on Wikipedia.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.840
You shouldn't be playing that game that long anyways.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.140
That is a long time to be playing one game.

06:15.140 --> 06:19.640
I played Pac-Man this week though, because I just wanted to, I guess.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.640
I don't know.

06:20.640 --> 06:25.520
Okay, and I tried playing Totem Ball, and to be honest, I mean, this isn't a huge surprise

06:25.520 --> 06:31.880
to me, because at E3 when I played Totem Ball, it sucked ass because you had people walking

06:31.880 --> 06:36.380
behind you and it just cannot pick up your movements.

06:36.380 --> 06:41.600
The main thing that comes down to these stupid games that use the camera for movement, like

06:41.600 --> 06:47.440
the eye toy, is that in your typical gaming environment, you do not have a giant white

06:47.440 --> 06:50.720
screen behind you to move in front of.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.520
So I don't know what the fuck environment they test this stuff in, which I'm assuming

06:54.520 --> 07:00.040
has a giant white screen behind them, but that does not work in the real world, so stop

07:00.040 --> 07:05.720
making games that don't work in the real world in just a lab environment, because to be honest,

07:05.720 --> 07:10.320
I can't get this game to work at all, and it's just, it's really sad because my room,

07:10.320 --> 07:14.680
I mean, it's lit well enough I would believe, but I guess not.

07:14.680 --> 07:19.280
So I don't want to have to make special lighting arrangements just to be able to play this

07:19.280 --> 07:24.800
game, and to be honest, the game doesn't look that fun, so whatever, it's free, so I don't

07:24.800 --> 07:30.280
feel like I wasted any money, but I'm not going to be buying any sort of eye toy play

07:30.280 --> 07:35.920
compilations down the road for this vision camera, so I don't know.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.740
I think it's kind of dumb.

07:37.740 --> 07:43.200
But then I played Zuma a little bit, because Nelly was hogging it and playing lots of Zuma,

07:43.200 --> 07:49.040
and then I don't know, I just tried to kind of mix it up a bit with the Xbox Live Arcade

07:49.040 --> 07:50.040
games.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.040
All right.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.040
Very cool.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.840
I also played Totem Ball this week, because I got an Xbox Live camera earlier this week,

07:55.840 --> 07:59.800
so I'm finally there and using that online, and I'll tell you the things I like about

07:59.800 --> 08:01.440
the camera, and I'll tell you things I don't like about the camera.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.040
The things I like about the camera is being able to take your own picture, making your

08:05.040 --> 08:07.360
own game or card picture, and having the cool little effects with it.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
I think I have a good one now.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
Yeah, you have a pretty good one.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.240
I took a very emo picture and did this effect on it.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.040
I wish I could copy it to my MySpace, it would be perfect.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.040
Actually, I'm not sure if you can pull them up, you might be able to pull them up on the

08:18.040 --> 08:19.040
Xbox website.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.040
No, you can't.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.800
It'll show, you know how you have the one that your friends can see, that's your gamer

08:23.800 --> 08:25.400
picture that you took of the camera?

08:25.400 --> 08:28.780
We also have to set the one for what your non-friends see, and that's the one that shows

08:28.780 --> 08:29.780
up on Xbox.com.

08:29.780 --> 08:30.780
That's lame.

08:30.780 --> 08:34.400
So I still have the Doom guy as my icon.

08:34.400 --> 08:39.040
But the other things I like about the camera is video chat is actually really smooth, and

08:39.040 --> 08:42.880
pretty good looking for the camera, provided you don't get a defective one, like Logie

08:42.880 --> 08:43.880
had at first.

08:43.880 --> 08:50.340
I think video chat's pretty awesome, and it's fast, and it's pretty clear.

08:50.340 --> 08:53.480
Some listener I was video chatting with tonight, and they didn't have a camera, so I couldn't

08:53.480 --> 08:59.240
see theirs, but they said that I looked really good, and of course I always look good.

08:59.240 --> 09:03.680
But then we were video chatting earlier in the week, Logie, and it was really smooth,

09:03.680 --> 09:07.040
and plus I made your controller vibrate a lot, for no good reason, just because I could

09:07.040 --> 09:08.040
actually.

09:08.040 --> 09:11.360
Well, then we'll have to video chat later on tonight and I'll just hold down the R button

09:11.360 --> 09:12.360
and shake it up.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.360
Yeah, that's stupid.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.360
Give it to your wife.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.560
She'll enjoy that.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.320
The things I don't like about the camera is totem ball.

09:20.320 --> 09:24.280
Sorry, if you're going to get a camera just so you can play totem ball because it's free

09:24.280 --> 09:30.160
on Xbox Live Arcade, not a selling point for the system, I'm sorry to say, and it basically

09:30.160 --> 09:37.200
boils down to, I mean, the game is an interesting concept, and it seems to be done pretty well

09:37.200 --> 09:41.240
in the graphical sense and all that stuff, but the controls stink.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.840
Controlling it with my hands is no fun at all.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.400
It's fun for about two minutes, and I do have a white wall in this house.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.980
I do have a white background pretty much that I'm playing against.

09:49.980 --> 09:54.040
The lighting is sometimes screwy because the light's coming in from the side, but even

09:54.040 --> 09:58.880
then I didn't have a whole lot of problems with iToy, but this game, I just can't control

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
it the way I want it to.

09:59.880 --> 10:00.880
It's not that great.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.400
And to be honest, I think it'd be cool if they didn't update to it where you can use

10:04.400 --> 10:09.000
the controller because I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard to program that in, but I mean

10:09.000 --> 10:11.040
that would be nice because the game looks kind of fun.

10:11.040 --> 10:16.520
It might be fun to play, you know, kind of like a marble blast type of game, but it's

10:16.520 --> 10:17.520
not very fun.

10:17.520 --> 10:22.240
I cannot get the damn thing to work, and it's frustrating, and after about two minutes playing

10:22.240 --> 10:26.000
this thing, I'm like, fuck this, I'll go play something else.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.480
And to be honest, if I paid for that, I'd be pissed off, and thank God they didn't,

10:30.480 --> 10:31.480
you know.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.640
They had the extra development time that they had because this game, you know, did come

10:34.640 --> 10:39.320
out a couple weeks after the camera, you know, that they would get it right, but apparently

10:39.320 --> 10:46.400
no, they didn't, so whatever, I guess they were like, fuck it, who cares, it's free.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.680
I'll say this, I did enjoy the pinball minigame that comes with it quite a bit where you use

10:50.680 --> 10:51.680
your hands as the flippers.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.320
I mean, it's kind of just like a one gimmick thing, but the pinball game did not frustrate

10:55.320 --> 11:00.080
me nearly as much as the actual game itself trying to control around, but the pinball

11:00.080 --> 11:02.840
one's easy because you just wave your right hand and it moves the right flipper, you wave

11:02.840 --> 11:07.280
your left hand and it moves the left flipper, and that was more entertaining for me than

11:07.280 --> 11:10.560
the actual game game that was there, so.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.080
I haven't tried the pinball yet.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.560
It doesn't look like totem ball is too popular amongst my friends too, like, I got three

11:15.560 --> 11:19.040
really easy achievements that aren't hard to get, and I think I have the highest gamer

11:19.040 --> 11:22.840
score on totem ball if anybody on my friends list, and about, I have about 70 people on

11:22.840 --> 11:27.820
my friends list, and about 10 or 15 of them have the camera, and you know, you know what

11:27.820 --> 11:31.640
game I actually did play, and I, you know, because I know it supports the camera, was

11:31.640 --> 11:33.040
Bank Shot Billiards 2.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
How was that?

11:34.040 --> 11:37.720
You know, it's interesting, I thought there was some 3D support where you can change the

11:37.720 --> 11:39.520
camera angle or something.

11:39.520 --> 11:44.760
I could not find that option whatsoever, so if it's there, it's hidden to me, because

11:44.760 --> 11:47.000
I don't see it, but I did play it.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.920
There was one achievement where you sink the nine ball in on a game of nine ball in the

11:50.920 --> 11:56.640
first break, and I got that the first try, so that wasn't too hard, but the game, the

11:56.640 --> 11:58.060
computer's fucking hard.

11:58.060 --> 12:03.200
Luckily though, you can't adjust the computer difficulty, but it's pretty fun for a billiards

12:03.200 --> 12:08.160
game, you can actually, you have pretty good control over it, so I like it.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.680
Worth 15 bucks?

12:09.680 --> 12:16.760
No, but luckily I got that with my live kit, my one year live kit, it came with it, so

12:16.760 --> 12:21.960
I wouldn't pay $15 for that thing, that thing may be five bucks, but I don't know.

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
Gotcha.

12:22.960 --> 12:29.200
Let's see, I wanted to mention some chat comments here, there's a lot of them going on here,

12:29.200 --> 12:36.240
mostly a lot of people sharing about their gaming week, let's see, I feel bad I can't

12:36.240 --> 12:40.600
pronounce this name, Tacte Poire, I think that is, says totem ball wasn't free, you

12:40.600 --> 12:46.120
paid for it with the camera, I guess essentially you can kind of look at it that way, let's

12:46.120 --> 12:50.680
see, and Ravens Dolphin says along the same lines, yes guy, it is free, you can't complain,

12:50.680 --> 12:52.760
talking about totem ball, so whatever.

12:52.760 --> 12:57.440
I didn't understand though that they threw in there with the 12 month camera bundle,

12:57.440 --> 13:03.340
which is the one I ended up getting, because I got to swap it out at Gamestop, they only

13:03.340 --> 13:08.900
have the gear bundle left, so some idiot employee gave it to me at equal cost, so I got a free

13:08.900 --> 13:16.360
year of live for, well, free actually, so that was interesting, but it came with Robotron,

13:16.360 --> 13:21.880
you know, and I already own Robotron, but that's the dumbest, I don't, why would you

13:21.880 --> 13:25.360
throw that in there, it doesn't even support the camera, I mean, I just don't get that

13:25.360 --> 13:26.360
at all.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.680
For the live element, being able to play on live, it's a cheap little game that they can,

13:29.680 --> 13:31.360
you know, demonstrate the live.

13:31.360 --> 13:36.360
Put in like, I don't know, like hardwood hearts or something, you know one of the other games

13:36.360 --> 13:40.120
that supports the camera, I would think that they would want camera supported games with

13:40.120 --> 13:42.600
the camera, I don't know.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.880
Alright, let's see what else I do with my gaming week, actually not a whole lot else,

13:45.880 --> 13:50.960
it's pretty much the only new game I played, yeah, I'm rocking my brain here, I can't think

13:50.960 --> 13:55.760
of anything else really new, oh, I'll think of one I played, I went back, because of all

13:55.760 --> 13:59.560
the love I was giving to this game recently on the show, I went back and found a copy

13:59.560 --> 14:04.840
of Civilization 1, and I got it running on the computer, and I took over the world once

14:04.840 --> 14:06.360
this week, it was fun.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
That's excellent.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.040
That's one of my favorite games of all time right there, I almost bought Civ 4 for the

14:10.040 --> 14:15.180
PC, but I needed to have a price drop first, because those Civ games always drop in price

14:15.180 --> 14:17.560
later on, so I'm waiting for that.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.760
Well, I was playing also Cookie Mama.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.760
How was Cookie Mama?

14:20.760 --> 14:25.440
It was actually pretty fun, I figured out how to play the game now, so it works pretty

14:25.440 --> 14:30.360
well for me, and it's just like a warrior type of game, it's basically a bunch of mini

14:30.360 --> 14:34.880
games and you cook something, and some are very easy, some are very hard, some will frustrate

14:34.880 --> 14:39.240
the hell out of you because it's just not sensitive enough, or what the case may be,

14:39.240 --> 14:43.440
but I don't know, it's kind of fun, I think you might get bored with it after a while

14:43.440 --> 14:50.000
though, but yeah, that's a really tough thing about the DS games, it's a lot of them, they

14:50.000 --> 14:54.200
have a really short attention span for me, it's not anything I can go back and play and

14:54.200 --> 14:57.680
play and play over and over again, like for example, Grand Theft Auto, I can go back and

14:57.680 --> 15:03.080
play that anytime, and it's still interesting to me, I don't know.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.240
Alright, well that's it for my gaming week, anything else for you?

15:06.240 --> 15:08.520
I believe that's all I had.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.880
Alright, now the chat room was asking us about this, and since we don't have Jamie here tonight

15:12.880 --> 15:15.520
and the segment's a little bit shorter because of it, we got a little time to talk about

15:15.520 --> 15:17.240
this.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.080
Video gaming showed up in a couple shows this week, and of course, one that was very well

15:21.080 --> 15:25.240
known that a lot of people saw was the South Park episode with World of Warcraft, what

15:25.240 --> 15:26.240
did you think?

15:26.240 --> 15:27.240
What did you think of the South Park episode with World of Warcraft?

15:27.240 --> 15:31.160
That was pretty funny, and I probably didn't get a lot of the humor in it because I don't

15:31.160 --> 15:34.320
play World of Warcraft, but it was still funny though, it was hilarious.

15:34.320 --> 15:39.480
I thought it was really well done, but I don't know, for me, I just kind of wish, I don't

15:39.480 --> 15:43.320
know, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge South Park fan and I love the movie, it's one of

15:43.320 --> 15:47.880
my favorite movies ever and I love a lot of the other stuff they do, but this episode

15:47.880 --> 15:53.640
for me, it just wasn't that same satire that I like out of the other stuff.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.800
I don't know, I think the problem was just the plot, I just didn't really like the plot,

15:56.800 --> 16:00.920
it seemed a little, I don't know, I just kind of wish they could have, I think I read a

16:00.920 --> 16:04.740
comment on one of the gaming sites where other people talk about this, where maybe Cartman

16:04.740 --> 16:07.680
could have been running a string of Chinese gold farmers or something, that would have

16:07.680 --> 16:08.880
been funny.

16:08.880 --> 16:19.200
I don't know, it was a little cheesy, but they did a very good job integrating the game

16:19.200 --> 16:25.040
with the show, but because of that, it kind of felt like an infomercial to me.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.200
It felt more like an infomercial, unless it's satire.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.040
Or even better, here's a better description of it, it felt like someone making a machima

16:32.040 --> 16:37.120
of the World of Warcraft game set to the audio track of South Park.

16:37.120 --> 16:43.280
It's like if you were to take a classic episode and just kind of make a machima from it.

16:43.280 --> 16:48.760
And of course, the funniest part of the whole show was, mom, bathroom, bathroom.

16:48.760 --> 16:54.560
But my mind's in the gutter like that, that made me laugh really hard.

16:54.560 --> 16:59.100
And a lot of people, some people are bitching about, oh, the Horde wasn't in it, or oh,

16:59.100 --> 17:02.720
their characters weren't the right levels, and if you're probably complaining about these

17:02.720 --> 17:07.520
types of things, you're probably exactly who these guys were trying to make satire out

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
of.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.520
Any time you're going to incorporate a game into a TV show, it ain't going to be perfect.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.920
Well, I bet you anything they're trying to do that on purpose.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.320
Probably, and I think all things considered, they did a pretty decent job.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.000
I think, yeah, it would have been nice to see a Horde character in there, because I

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
play a Horde character myself, but at the same time, the more I think about it, the

17:24.000 --> 17:27.360
more I go, you're starting to look like that fat guy at the computer with the drool and

17:27.360 --> 17:29.640
the chip on his shirt, so I stopped thinking about it.

17:29.640 --> 17:33.360
It's going to be the end of the world of Warcraft.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.760
Did you see The Office with the Call of Duty 2 references?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.880
I saw the clip of it.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.040
I saw like half of it.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.400
I didn't see the whole episode, but I saw like half of it, and it seemed to get it pretty

17:42.400 --> 17:43.400
well.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.600
The Office is funny.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.200
I have to admit, though, I'm a big fan of the British Office, and I watched that whole

17:48.200 --> 17:53.200
one before the American one showed up, and so it's always weird for me to watch the American

17:53.200 --> 17:57.240
episodes of The Office, but it seems like they did a good job making satire a Call of

17:57.240 --> 17:58.240
Duty.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.760
I watched season one and two of The Office, and I just started watching it last night.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.760
I don't have to borrow them.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.320
They're just different shows, except for the very, very first episode, it was the same

18:04.320 --> 18:07.940
plot in the British one and the American one.

18:07.940 --> 18:11.200
We got up through the second episode, which is Diversity Day.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.200
Yeah, yeah.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.200
That's always funny.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.200
All right.

18:14.200 --> 18:19.800
No, you know, I appreciate that the chat room is going to link me to a torrent of The Office,

18:19.800 --> 18:21.320
but I still have it on the DVR.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.480
I'm just being lazy when it comes to watching it, so I will watch the whole thing.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.280
You know what I'm very disappointed about?

18:26.280 --> 18:30.800
I didn't even realize they had started a new season of it yet, drawing together.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.800
There was a new season.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.800
It was horrible.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
I watched the season premiere, and it was horrible.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
It was horrible.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
I'm sorry.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.240
I didn't find it funny at all.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.240
I don't know.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.000
That's another show I really like that had really weird scenes.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
It was pretty funny.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't know.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
All right.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
Anyway, now we're turning into TV talk, so we better get back to, I mean, a lot of nerds

18:50.000 --> 18:52.200
like their TV.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.240
They have a link type character in it.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.360
I mean, it's game related a little bit, so whatever.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.360
All right.

18:58.360 --> 19:02.000
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.280
We don't have a whole lot tonight.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.840
Obviously, Jamie will be back this week.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
She's out this week.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.880
The DVR previews are continuing tonight.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.280
You'll hear those a little later in this segment.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.440
I want to give a quick shout out to one of our listeners who's in chat tonight, El Mullet,

19:13.440 --> 19:17.440
who hasn't been there for a long, long time, but he says he wanted to come to chat tonight

19:17.440 --> 19:22.120
because he's getting married next week, so he's getting married next Sunday, so he wanted

19:22.120 --> 19:27.920
to have his, I guess, a good last Sunday night hurrah of single life here in the chat room,

19:27.920 --> 19:28.920
so I appreciate that.

19:28.920 --> 19:29.920
I'm wearing the shirt.

19:29.920 --> 19:30.920
You are.

19:30.920 --> 19:31.920
Loki's wearing the shirt we bought him.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.920
Jamie and I got him a shirt before he got married.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.920
It says, Game Over, with the husband frowning and the wife smiling.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.920
It's great.

19:36.920 --> 19:37.920
You've probably seen it on the internet, other places.

19:37.920 --> 19:38.920
It's at Target.

19:38.920 --> 19:39.920
Yeah.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.920
A lot of people have it, but that's cool.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.000
All right.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.440
Anyway.

19:45.440 --> 19:49.560
Any advice for the gamer about to cross into married life?

19:49.560 --> 19:56.680
Hopefully your wife-to-be likes games, otherwise you'll be playing a lot less games.

19:56.680 --> 20:01.320
My suggestion is find something that she likes to do.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.520
My wife is totally jaded on games.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.600
She says, yet she plays Zuma.

20:06.600 --> 20:12.680
I seriously think she's played the 360 more than me this week, and I'm not kidding.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.640
It's like crack to her.

20:14.640 --> 20:20.480
She gets so frustrated if she can't beat certain levels, and she's stuck on level six right

20:20.480 --> 20:25.400
now, and it's just, oh man, she'll be just sitting there for hours, and I'm just like,

20:25.400 --> 20:30.640
can I play Saints Row, and she's like, I'm playing Zuma.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.640
And just so you know, Elle Mullet, we have the stripper coming soon for the chat room

20:33.640 --> 20:34.960
bachelor party.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.920
DMN, go ahead and start taking it off.

20:38.920 --> 20:39.920
Just kidding.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.920
All right.

20:40.920 --> 20:41.920
Let's get into this gaming news, for real.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.920
All right.

20:42.920 --> 20:48.160
So anyways, this week was a whole bunch of Wii news rumors, et cetera, and of course

20:48.160 --> 20:53.800
a lot of them were kind of based around GameStop, and especially since GameStop had their wonderful

20:53.800 --> 20:59.320
annual sales conference in Dallas, lots of information leaking out of there, and of course

20:59.320 --> 21:01.360
lots of secondhand accounts and stuff.

21:01.360 --> 21:05.680
So we don't know how much of this is true, but we're reporting it to you anyways.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.400
One big thing, though, coming out of it was that GameStop said at the show that they would

21:09.400 --> 21:16.160
be the only retail at launch to have Wii demonstration units available in their stores.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.520
And so basically you can go test out the game systems as well.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.680
I don't know if that's entirely true, but maybe at launch, yeah.

21:24.680 --> 21:28.840
Maybe they might be a little bit later to get them to other stores, but I don't know.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.380
You know what I was thinking about with this whole thing, with the GameStop having the

21:32.380 --> 21:34.200
exclusive Wii?

21:34.200 --> 21:38.400
You know, this actually may have some truth in my mind, whereas I think some of the other

21:38.400 --> 21:40.960
rumors we're going to get to are a bunch of poopy.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.040
I think the interesting thing about this, remember when you came on and you did your

21:44.040 --> 21:48.240
episode 198 report, the big one that was really controversial, where you had all these, you

21:48.240 --> 21:51.400
know, things you were talking about, you know, all this upcoming news, and one of the things

21:51.400 --> 21:55.300
you said is that there's not going to be any demo kiosks for the Wii.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.560
They told us that they're not doing demo kiosks for the Wii.

21:57.560 --> 22:02.000
But almost that exact same day, pictures were being posted on the internet elsewhere from

22:02.000 --> 22:05.960
these GameStop EB people that had pictures of the Wii demo unit that was coming in.

22:05.960 --> 22:11.480
But now that this story has come out, I kind of go, this could make both reports accurate,

22:11.480 --> 22:15.440
where of course you guys were told there's not going to be any kiosks because you're

22:15.440 --> 22:16.440
not getting any.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.440
They're all going to GameStop.

22:17.440 --> 22:22.320
And here's the other thing too, our sales rep or whatever from Nintendo deals with only

22:22.320 --> 22:25.800
a certain region, maybe say the West Coast or whatever.

22:25.800 --> 22:31.400
He doesn't deal with, you know, GameStop, you know, which would be the Dallas area.

22:31.400 --> 22:36.800
So where his information might be that there are no kiosks, you know, someone else that

22:36.800 --> 22:41.080
works for Nintendo, yeah, there are kiosks because they're going to GameStop.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.080
So kind of interesting.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.080
It makes sense.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.880
Because I think about that, and I think about trying to put all that together, because I

22:46.880 --> 22:49.560
don't think the reps that were talking to you were full of BS.

22:49.560 --> 22:55.280
I know you're not full of BS, despite what other people on the internet might think.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.520
It kind of adds up for me that this could be true.

22:57.520 --> 23:03.880
And the thing, I think the thing, the major difficulty with having a GameStop kiosk, or

23:03.880 --> 23:08.680
not a GameStop kiosk, but a Wii kiosk is that the controllers don't have a wired version.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.920
There's no one that you can just kind of tie down.

23:11.920 --> 23:16.160
And I mean, sure, you could probably, you know, put some, you know, steel cable on there

23:16.160 --> 23:17.160
or something like that.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.400
Yeah, I don't think it'd be that hard to put a steel cable on.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.200
But I mean, still, it's going to look kind of funky.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.000
Or put a sensor on the back so when someone tries to walk out the door with it, beep,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
beep, beep, beep.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
That won't stop anybody.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I don't know.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
That would come off so easy.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
But anyway.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
It's an idea.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Geez.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
The other news that came out actually.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.680
I want to ask real quick though, what about now, the thing that makes me think this may

23:34.680 --> 23:39.880
not be true is that there was this story earlier about Wal-Mart said that they weren't going

23:39.880 --> 23:41.120
to be doing it or whatever.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.200
And I'm thinking, well, when was Wal-Mart given an option if it's exclusive to GameStop,

23:45.200 --> 23:46.200
right?

23:46.200 --> 23:47.200
Well, who knows?

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
I mean, I don't know.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
I don't know.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
So take it with a grain of salt.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.700
Maybe, okay, well, let me put it this way.

23:51.700 --> 23:55.020
Maybe they weren't the only ones that were going to be exclusive.

23:55.020 --> 23:58.760
Maybe it was going to be GameStop and Wal-Mart and maybe a few other retailers.

23:58.760 --> 24:02.600
But the retailer said, hey, we don't want this demo unit because we're afraid that

24:02.600 --> 24:03.600
people are going to get hurt.

24:03.600 --> 24:07.000
And to be honest, after seeing some of these people try to navigate the self-checkout,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.120
yeah, they will get hurt because they're too dumb to figure it out.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.920
Jeremy Todd 1 says in our chat room, they could just tie a wire where the wrist strap

24:14.920 --> 24:15.920
goes.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.480
That wouldn't be that hard at all.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.480
Okay.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.480
That's a perfectly good option.

24:20.480 --> 24:25.200
And then I could just take my X-Acto knife out of my pocket and cut the wrist strap.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.680
Okay, it's not going to be...

24:27.680 --> 24:29.600
Steel cable does not exactly cut with...

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.600
Take out the wrist.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
Never mind.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
I'm thinking this whole other thing.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
Never mind.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.320
And actually, I don't know if that would work either because wrist straps, those little

24:37.320 --> 24:41.320
things on them, the string's pretty thin, so I don't know if you'd be able to stick

24:41.320 --> 24:42.320
steel cable through.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.320
Ah, whatever.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.320
Whatever.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.320
Okay, let's just say you were able to stick steel cable on there.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.080
Steel people are going to throw them at people and it's just...

24:48.080 --> 24:50.240
We'll just see what freaking happens when it happens.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
And to be honest...

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240
We're a month away.

24:52.240 --> 24:57.080
Just because they don't have a kiosk setup, they can set up a kiosk type setup anyways.

24:57.080 --> 25:01.000
I mean, you know, who's to say someone can't just bust one of these things open and just

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
create their own?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.120
So they'll be out there.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.120
Whatever.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.920
Anyways, there's some other news also that GameStop was going to be the first to be...

25:08.920 --> 25:14.520
Or they're going to be selling the Zune in store, so if you have a fascination with the

25:14.520 --> 25:17.080
Microsoft music player, well, there you go.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.520
You can buy it from them.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.040
It's kind of interesting though, because the other mention on this one article is that

25:22.040 --> 25:25.240
this is kind of the first time that they've done this, but if I remember correctly, they

25:25.240 --> 25:28.520
were actually selling Creative Nomads in their store as well.

25:28.520 --> 25:33.560
Maybe not iPods, but they have been selling music playing devices.

25:33.560 --> 25:38.960
Now some of the more unbelievable rumors from the whole GameStop thing, one of them being

25:38.960 --> 25:46.040
that the GameStop Wii kiosk is going to require a credit card to be able to be used.

25:46.040 --> 25:53.440
So I imagine with this kind of logic here, probably giving them your license or credit

25:53.440 --> 26:00.080
card so you don't walk out with the Wii controller, maybe so that they don't have to strap them

26:00.080 --> 26:01.080
down.

26:01.080 --> 26:04.840
I don't know why, when I first read this story, I imagined in my mind having to slide your

26:04.840 --> 26:07.840
credit card through the Wii demo thing, and I'm like, no way!

26:07.840 --> 26:12.380
I would never do that, because they might charge me for something.

26:12.380 --> 26:17.320
So it'll force me to put a pre-order on the Wii, like all that peer pressure they give

26:17.320 --> 26:21.000
you at those stores.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.720
That makes more sense though, it's kind of like playing pool at a bar, you have to give

26:24.720 --> 26:27.480
them your driver's license so you don't walk out with the cue ball.

26:27.480 --> 26:35.460
I guess, but then again, I hope they don't do this, but I guess you have to, because

26:35.460 --> 26:41.340
people walk away with this stuff, so better safe than sorry, I guess.

26:41.340 --> 26:44.400
I still do think overall it's probably a BS story.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.920
JeremyTodd1 in chat brings up a good point, this can't be true!

26:47.920 --> 26:51.240
Nintendo's trying to market to everybody here, so why would they make the kiosk only available

26:51.240 --> 26:53.280
to older people who have a credit card, that's a very good point.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.320
Or driver's license, yeah, seriously.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.240
I don't think so.

26:58.240 --> 27:04.680
Another story though, coming out of the whole GameStop conference thing, they're saying

27:04.680 --> 27:12.700
that basically GameStop, the PS3 pre-orders are based on loyal customers.

27:12.700 --> 27:18.840
Basically from an anonymous tip given to Kotaku from a GameStop manager, each GameStop store

27:18.840 --> 27:23.720
will receive an average of six systems, more for the higher volume stores and less for

27:23.720 --> 27:24.720
the dead stores.

27:24.720 --> 27:29.200
One of two systems can be given to employees at their store manager's discretion, I don't

27:29.200 --> 27:32.560
think so, but that doesn't sound right at all.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.000
The rest are going to be given out to store regulars.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.480
If a manager feels that he has a customer who is very loyal, shops there often, reserves

27:39.480 --> 27:43.120
many things, they may call them and ask them if they want to guarantee one of the remaining

27:43.120 --> 27:44.120
four consoles.

27:44.120 --> 27:49.840
Apparently all four of the remaining consoles are handed out in this fashion.

27:49.840 --> 27:56.720
That doesn't even sound right at all.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.940
Not every GameStop will get the same amount of PS3s, I don't think.

27:58.940 --> 28:03.760
It would depend on volume, so that whole, you know, you get four or whatever, no, don't

28:03.760 --> 28:04.760
buy it.

28:04.760 --> 28:05.760
That's a crap policy too.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.520
There'd be so much scandal that goes along with that.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.520
And they're not going to go away.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.400
And to be honest, they're not going to give them to employees at all.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.920
If they're going to get four or six, you know, they're not going to do it.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.400
And I think that kind of goes with other stories that we've had about the reservations.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.400
Right.

28:22.400 --> 28:26.520
I just want to say real quick, by the way, we had an issue in our chat room, if you're

28:26.520 --> 28:30.480
listening live on Sunday, where apparently some folks were not able to get in because

28:30.480 --> 28:32.960
somehow the limit got set on the chat room.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.960
That's been removed.

28:33.960 --> 28:34.960
I just took it off.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.760
So if you've been trying to join chat and weren't having any luck, try again, you should

28:37.760 --> 28:38.760
be able to get in now.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.560
And these are chat rooms that full though.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.560
Excellent.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.680
All right.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.680
So no PS3 preorders from regulars, huh?

28:46.680 --> 28:47.680
Yeah.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.680
All right.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.440
Well, there might not be any preorders from anyone at all.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.680
1UP is speculating this week that at the annual GameStop conference held last Saturday in

28:55.680 --> 28:56.680
Dallas.

28:56.680 --> 29:00.320
Quote, the great thing is there is a lot of demand, said Steve Morgan, president of GameStop,

29:00.320 --> 29:01.800
but launch is one day.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.420
And really the key to this business is what flows after the launch.

29:04.420 --> 29:06.000
We did learn a lesson last year.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.800
I think the lesson is caution and optimism at the same time.

29:10.800 --> 29:14.480
GameStop's decision not to guarantee your hardware preorder is by no means carved in

29:14.480 --> 29:15.480
stone.

29:15.480 --> 29:19.400
But from this point, it seems a pretty sure thing from a strictly business point of view.

29:19.400 --> 29:23.440
Last year, GameStop caught some heat after it mistakenly took in more Xbox 360 preorders

29:23.440 --> 29:25.440
than it had the capacity to fulfill.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.360
Certainly, that would be correct.

29:27.360 --> 29:31.440
We all remember people were blaming GameStop when they couldn't get their Xbox 360s.

29:31.440 --> 29:35.720
But people were saying what they promised them.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.120
But certainly, they've learned their lesson, it sounds like, and they won't be doing that

29:38.120 --> 29:40.040
again anytime soon.

29:40.040 --> 29:45.840
But the other thing I heard was that that's not exactly true either, that they are going

29:45.840 --> 29:50.560
to be getting some or they're going to be starting taking preorders because this is

29:50.560 --> 29:52.360
basically the point that they made.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.360
Look at Hawaii.

29:53.360 --> 29:58.320
Hawaii's been doing preorders for the PlayStation 3, and we right now are testing that thing

29:58.320 --> 29:59.320
out.

29:59.320 --> 30:03.480
So yes, they are taking preorders on it, but they're saying that the preorders are probably

30:03.480 --> 30:08.120
not going to start until November.

30:08.120 --> 30:16.000
You might start seeing less information about the GameStop stuff circulating the internet.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
A report came in to Gotaku earlier this week that says that basically, the GameStop employees

30:21.000 --> 30:23.760
have been told to shut their mouths.

30:23.760 --> 30:27.240
I'm a manager at an EB GameStop location, and recently we received this great little

30:27.240 --> 30:29.360
scare notice to pass around the store.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.720
Basically it's been sent in response to all the news about the PS3 Wii preorders, as well

30:32.720 --> 30:37.560
as to scare employees off from buying PS3s and selling them online.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.560
So interesting.

30:38.560 --> 30:41.560
It was this interesting little cease and desist, and you can read the whole thing if you go

30:41.560 --> 30:44.480
over to Gotaku and you can click and find the whole thing.

30:44.480 --> 30:49.080
But it's basically your typical, you know, we'd like to issue a friendly reminder about

30:49.080 --> 30:52.080
the company policy, blah, blah, blah type thing.

30:52.080 --> 30:56.160
So in other words, yeah, stop coming on the internet and blabbing everything because man,

30:56.160 --> 31:00.280
people can't keep their mouths shut when it comes to some of these rumors.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.280
That's kind of funny.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.760
Well, one of these people that can't keep their mouths shut about rumors or release

31:04.760 --> 31:06.760
dates and stuff would be me.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.600
And well, there's lots of good stuff coming, well not a whole lot of good stuff, but still

31:10.600 --> 31:14.800
some pretty good stuff coming out this week on all the systems.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.960
Starting off with the DS, and Rob, apparently I was wrong earlier, Clubhouse Games is coming

31:18.960 --> 31:19.960
out this week.

31:19.960 --> 31:20.960
Alright!

31:20.960 --> 31:22.180
So that would be pretty good.

31:22.180 --> 31:29.080
Crash Boom Bang, if you happen to be craving some Crash the Bandicoot party games, I don't

31:29.080 --> 31:31.440
know, might be something for you.

31:31.440 --> 31:36.780
Anyways, we also have Legend of Spyro A New Beginning coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox

31:36.780 --> 31:37.780
and the GameCube.

31:37.780 --> 31:42.780
If you have a 360, yeah you can play the Xbox version of that if you're really craving some

31:42.780 --> 31:45.840
Legend of Spyro.

31:45.840 --> 31:51.480
Also Avatar is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the GameCube, and all the portable

31:51.480 --> 31:53.760
systems as well.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.020
Should be pretty cool.

31:56.020 --> 31:59.560
You're a fan of the Family Feud, that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Game

31:59.560 --> 32:00.560
Boy Advance.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.560
Worst game I've played at E3, I'm sorry to say.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.660
And don't get me wrong, I love the Feud.

32:04.660 --> 32:10.040
I love the Richard Dawson days where he'd make out with all the women on the show, but

32:10.040 --> 32:14.980
something is just not right in the past 20 years now with Family Feud.

32:14.980 --> 32:15.980
So sorry to say.

32:15.980 --> 32:19.040
Mortal Kombat Armageddon also coming out this week on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.040
Oh, that's this week.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.040
Oh, very cool.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.600
Maybe not so much on the Xbox this week, because I mean the date we have in our system right

32:24.600 --> 32:30.280
now, somehow Midway moved their date just on the Xbox version, so don't be surprised

32:30.280 --> 32:35.640
if you don't see it in stores this week, but you know, it is slated though for this week

32:35.640 --> 32:38.220
though for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, so.

32:38.220 --> 32:47.880
But whatever, anyways, then of course on, you've got Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on PlayStation

32:47.880 --> 32:50.320
2 and Xbox as well as PSP.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.120
For the PC, you're getting a few things.

32:53.120 --> 32:59.800
Warhammer 4000 Dawn of War Dark Crusade, Devil May Cry 3 Dante's Awakening Special Edition

32:59.800 --> 33:08.640
on the PC, also Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf 07, and Dirt Origin of Species.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.640
Alright.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.640
So that should be pretty good.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.760
Next week's going to be lots of good stuff, including Bully.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.760
Oh, okay.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.200
And you're going to be getting that I'm sure?

33:18.200 --> 33:20.440
I'll be getting it one way or another.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.440
Alright.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.440
Let's see.

33:22.440 --> 33:25.640
Next week in Japan, I've got Japanese release dates for you, or I should say this week in

33:25.640 --> 33:29.000
Japan, not a whole lot of pickings for you guys in Japan this week.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.440
It's kind of a slow week.

33:30.440 --> 33:36.240
MotoGP 2006 is on its way, along with Rockstar Table Tennis making its way in Japan this

33:36.240 --> 33:37.240
week.

33:37.240 --> 33:42.380
I also forgot one in PlayStation 2, and this one is awesome, God Hand is coming out this

33:42.380 --> 33:43.380
week.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.380
Oh.

33:44.380 --> 33:45.380
And definitely worth checking out.

33:45.380 --> 33:48.080
I'll actually have a review for that next week.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.560
That's one of the games I have on my slate to play.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.560
Alright.

33:51.560 --> 33:52.560
Sounds good.

33:52.560 --> 33:56.080
Jamie's not here tonight, so sorry to our European listeners, but we're just going to

33:56.080 --> 33:57.240
not do your dates tonight.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.680
No, I'm kidding.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.240
I got you guys covered.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.240
Here we go.

34:01.240 --> 34:05.120
Coming out this week, the week of the 13th, you guys have Crazy Frog Racer and English

34:05.120 --> 34:08.600
Training on the DS, you know, because your English isn't good.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.600
No, I'm kidding.

34:09.600 --> 34:14.120
Obviously, that's going to other territories besides just Britain probably will be released

34:14.120 --> 34:17.560
in the other European territories.

34:17.560 --> 34:21.640
The Power Stone Collection on the PSP, a lot of people saying there's the reason to get

34:21.640 --> 34:22.640
a PSP right there.

34:22.640 --> 34:23.640
I'll tell you what.

34:23.640 --> 34:26.360
I played it at E3, not the same magic at the Dreamcast.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.360
I can't explain it.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.960
It's just not the same magic, but hey, if you're a Power Stone fan, you might get a

34:30.960 --> 34:31.960
kick out of this.

34:31.960 --> 34:36.320
And then Resident Evil 4 Platinum Edition making its way to PlayStation 2 along with

34:36.320 --> 34:41.480
Wild Arms 4, Steam Bot Chronicles also on the PlayStation 2 this week.

34:41.480 --> 34:46.640
If you're a Game Boy Advance player, Rebel Star Tactical Command coming out for the GBA

34:46.640 --> 34:47.960
this week in Europe.

34:47.960 --> 34:48.960
Have fun.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.960
Cool.

34:49.960 --> 34:54.180
Some interesting information, which is not, well, I shouldn't say it's too surprising,

34:54.180 --> 34:59.480
but Miyamoto's actually come out to say that the Wii is, well, the hardware is basically

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
a GameCube.

35:00.480 --> 35:06.000
And, you know, that's kind of like saying a Pentium 4 is basically a Pentium 1.

35:06.000 --> 35:12.360
Basically that it's on the same kind of architecture as the original GameCube, but of course, it's

35:12.360 --> 35:17.060
going to be a little bit more souped up, you know, kind of like, you know, how a DS is

35:17.060 --> 35:21.120
almost a Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance is almost a Super Nintendo and so on and so

35:21.120 --> 35:22.120
forth.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.400
And, yeah, I mean, big deal.

35:24.400 --> 35:28.120
I mean, that's not a big surprise seeing all these games ported from the GameCube over

35:28.120 --> 35:29.680
to the Wii, so.

35:29.680 --> 35:33.360
Well, you know, now the anti-Nintendo fan base, though, is like, you know, oh, you're

35:33.360 --> 35:35.520
paying $250 for a controller.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
Have fun, suckers.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.200
And, you know, people are also saying about, you know, Super Smash Brothers.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.080
I just saw a post in the live-drama community this afternoon that was talking about, you

35:42.080 --> 35:47.280
know, Smash Brothers that's coming out on the Wii is not really going to be using the

35:47.280 --> 35:50.920
Wii functionality in the main game, which is not much of a surprise.

35:50.920 --> 35:54.640
I mean, you know, I kind of wouldn't want it to, but now they're saying, why don't

35:54.640 --> 35:56.040
they just do it on the GameCube then?

35:56.040 --> 35:59.760
Well, just because it's, well, the specs are still upgraded just because, it's just

35:59.760 --> 36:05.360
like saying, you know, a PC nowadays, you know, which is still based on the same architecture

36:05.360 --> 36:10.800
as a PC from like, say, 15 years ago, I mean, granted, they're not the same thing, but

36:10.800 --> 36:16.400
they're based off the same architecture, so, so, you know, big deal.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.400
Like I say, play the games.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.160
If you like the games, great.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.160
Who cares about specs?

36:20.160 --> 36:25.280
I mean, you know, I don't give a shit of how many USB ports are on this thing.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.280
It does not matter.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.360
So, just play the games.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.360
If you like them, great.

36:28.360 --> 36:34.400
I mean, after all, Pac-Man wasn't really pushing, you know, the graphics or anything, so, whatever.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.400
Alright.

36:35.400 --> 36:41.240
Bandit in our chat room says, Miyamoto said it himself that the Wii is a souped-up GameCube.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.280
Certainly a quote a lot of people have been running with this week.

36:43.280 --> 36:48.920
I saw that posted on a lot of blogs, but, you know, so, Sony said that the PlayStation

36:48.920 --> 36:50.400
3 is future proof.

36:50.400 --> 36:56.520
I don't care cancer, so, I mean, I don't believe that either, but whatever.

36:56.520 --> 36:57.520
Alright.

36:57.520 --> 37:02.600
Well, if you are excited to be getting your hands on a Wii soon, good news for you.

37:02.600 --> 37:06.380
The Wii production is exceeding expectations.

37:06.380 --> 37:13.000
According to UBS, 2 million Wii consoles were completed in the third quarter, July to September,

37:13.000 --> 37:16.080
to support the upcoming fourth quarter launch.

37:16.080 --> 37:20.280
In addition, at least 7 million, and potentially as high as 9 million more units, are in the

37:20.280 --> 37:23.360
build plan for the fourth quarter of 2006.

37:23.360 --> 37:28.200
This production ramp handily exceeds a publicly announced target for 6 million units to ship

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
by year-end.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.160
So, Nintendo may have been playing it conservative a little bit with their launch numbers, and

37:33.160 --> 37:34.760
they may have more.

37:34.760 --> 37:39.920
I still think, if you want to get this on launch day, you probably are going to be having

37:39.920 --> 37:42.040
to do the pre-order or the campout or one of those things.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.920
I don't think you're going to be able to walk into the store and pick one up if you didn't

37:44.920 --> 37:46.200
do some type of pre-planning.

37:46.200 --> 37:50.160
And it's great that they're going to have that many units, but this thing's on all the

37:50.160 --> 37:54.680
Christmas lists, all the different retailers' Christmas lists, and once they launch their

37:54.680 --> 38:00.400
marketing campaign for this, it's going to be the hot Christmas item, so you better get

38:00.400 --> 38:02.640
on those pre-order lists as soon as you can.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.240
How important are the launch days, you think?

38:05.240 --> 38:09.940
Because there's been a lot of focus in the past couple generations of gaming about the

38:09.940 --> 38:12.720
launch day and how the launch goes.

38:12.720 --> 38:18.080
We had the Xbox 360 launch, which was this big ass deal, and the Wii launch is shaping

38:18.080 --> 38:20.040
up to be huge as well.

38:20.040 --> 38:24.480
PlayStation 3, it's kind of getting some mixed reactions, but certainly if you're a hardcore

38:24.480 --> 38:27.760
Sony person, this is something you're looking forward to as well.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.160
But how important is launch day?

38:29.160 --> 38:33.800
Because I go back and I think about PlayStation 2, and I think about, I remember seeing the

38:33.800 --> 38:37.440
lines on TV and stuff, but I don't remember being so excited about a PlayStation 2 right

38:37.440 --> 38:39.440
on launch day.

38:39.440 --> 38:44.120
How important is the launch, and yet the PlayStation 2 was still the most successful of the last

38:44.120 --> 38:45.120
gen.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.120
It's just the bragging.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
It's the E-Penis thing.

38:47.120 --> 38:51.200
It's basically, I've got the console and you don't, or I'm playing it first.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.000
Everyone's got to be first.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
So I don't know.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.520
I think what's important is how many units they can sell by the end of the year.

39:00.520 --> 39:05.720
Right now in the U.S., I believe there are up to about 3 million Xbox 360 units.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.880
Don't count on me on that, but I think that's about where they're at.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.200
I think worldwide they're about 6 million.

39:12.200 --> 39:18.200
And if they can sell 4 million Wii units in the United States alone, and I'm sure they're

39:18.200 --> 39:24.380
going to be able to sell all 9 million units of the Wii, they're going to blow past the

39:24.380 --> 39:26.520
competition really quick.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.280
And that's going to probably show something to publishers, because to be honest, publishers

39:30.280 --> 39:34.280
are going to make games mainly for those systems that have the most units out there because

39:34.280 --> 39:36.420
they can sell more units of their game.

39:36.420 --> 39:40.480
And that's going to be important when you don't want this thing being like the GameCube

39:40.480 --> 39:45.300
where it didn't sell as many units, and so the third-party publishers didn't really support

39:45.300 --> 39:46.300
that system.

39:46.300 --> 39:51.620
Whereas now, if they can blow 9 million units away by the end of the year worldwide, that's

39:51.620 --> 39:55.280
going to be a big, like, hello, pay attention to this.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.200
But again, this is all speculation and what-ifs.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.200
Exactly.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.120
So the damn thing could tank, for all we know.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.120
It could.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.120
It could very well tank, but I don't think so.

40:03.120 --> 40:07.000
I think four-hour lines of E3 pretty much tell you it's not going to tank.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Alright, we'll see.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.200
Bandit in our chat room says, Best Buy better not say, oh, you can buy a Wii from us, but

40:12.200 --> 40:13.640
only as a package deal.

40:13.640 --> 40:14.640
Agreed.

40:14.640 --> 40:15.640
They are.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.600
I bet you they will, because, and this is something that I will not buy at a Best Buy.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.140
Well, I'm going to tell you why they're going to do that, though.

40:22.140 --> 40:25.680
The reason why they're going to do that is because there's no margins on this thing.

40:25.680 --> 40:30.520
That's one thing I mentioned a couple episodes ago, is that the margins on the Wii system

40:30.520 --> 40:35.960
is only a few bucks, and they have to sell it in a bundle to make money off this thing,

40:35.960 --> 40:40.360
because they're only making like ten bucks off of each system, so it makes sense to bundle

40:40.360 --> 40:45.080
it with some controllers and, say, a game.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.280
I know our company-

40:46.280 --> 40:49.640
Well, that's going to be what dooms the sales of the Wii, if it-

40:49.640 --> 40:50.640
Not necessarily.

40:50.640 --> 40:54.920
I mean, you don't have to buy it that way, because you can go into a Walmart or whatever

40:54.920 --> 40:57.440
and buy it just by itself.

40:57.440 --> 41:01.440
But some of these companies are going to want to try to do this, and you just don't have

41:01.440 --> 41:02.440
to buy from them.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.400
Or if you're really desperate to get the system at launch, then yeah, you will buy that.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.760
But I don't know.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.740
No one's saying anything for sure, but don't be surprised that they do, because they've

41:11.740 --> 41:13.920
done it in the past with other systems.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.900
Anoush in our chat room says, Sky, do you know of any major stores that are doing a

41:16.900 --> 41:18.480
midnight release?

41:18.480 --> 41:20.640
I imagine a lot of them.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.000
Imagine most will probably have to.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.640
Who did ones for Xbox 360?

41:24.640 --> 41:26.200
That's probably who's going to do them for Wii.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.200
I mean, you can just kind of go down that list right there.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.720
Whoever did them for Xbox 360 is probably going to do them for Wii.

41:31.720 --> 41:36.880
I know a lot of GameStops do them for Madden, and just games, not even systems.

41:36.880 --> 41:42.320
So I would imagine if there's a big GameStop in your area, or EB, any of those type, they

41:42.320 --> 41:44.360
will probably be doing a big midnight party.

41:44.360 --> 41:48.480
God, does that mean we have to go out and report on a midnight launch?

41:48.480 --> 41:49.480
Fuck no.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.280
Why do I have to go out there, dude?

41:52.280 --> 41:54.200
I'm getting mine early.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.760
For the goodness of better journalism.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.080
Yeah, okay.

41:58.080 --> 42:02.800
Listen, I don't want to be like the news crew, because you know every fucking year they always

42:02.800 --> 42:04.320
have some stupid station.

42:04.320 --> 42:08.600
Look, there's people outside waiting in the cold for their new game system.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.600
What's this new game system?

42:09.600 --> 42:10.600
The why?

42:10.600 --> 42:13.920
Why must you have the Nintendo why?

42:13.920 --> 42:14.920
It's Wii.

42:14.920 --> 42:15.920
Why?

42:15.920 --> 42:17.920
Why is it called...

42:17.920 --> 42:18.920
It's Wii.

42:18.920 --> 42:19.920
Why?

42:19.920 --> 42:25.320
I believe I may have actually already committed this program to be working with other podcasters

42:25.320 --> 42:31.760
in some type of Wii news live on launch night.

42:31.760 --> 42:34.160
By the way, there's a staff meeting after the show.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.920
Way to go, Rob.

42:36.920 --> 42:37.920
Loser.

42:37.920 --> 42:43.260
One of the games you might be expecting, I'm not sure if at launch, Bionicle Heroes is

42:43.260 --> 42:46.880
going to be heading to the Wii, and Bionicle Heroes is going to be pretty good.

42:46.880 --> 42:51.520
It's actually done by Traveler's Tale, which I believe is people behind Lego Star Wars

42:51.520 --> 42:57.080
and the Lego Star Wars original trilogy game, so of course you would imagine, okay, Lego's

42:57.080 --> 43:00.440
game, Bionicle Heroes, yeah, makes perfect sense.

43:00.440 --> 43:05.240
This of course, information coming from the ESRB website, which seems to be leaking a

43:05.240 --> 43:12.480
lot of info on upcoming games for the Wii, so look for that soon.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.360
All right.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.360
I will.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.360
Thank you for that.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.360
Excellent.

43:18.360 --> 43:23.280
A lot of people were bitching about the Wii not having a wireless, or I'm sorry, a wired

43:23.280 --> 43:27.840
internet port in it because of course it supports the wireless internet, but what if your house

43:27.840 --> 43:30.560
isn't wired for wireless?

43:30.560 --> 43:31.560
Then you're screwed, right?

43:31.560 --> 43:32.560
Not necessarily.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.560
Not necessarily.

43:33.560 --> 43:37.840
Here's the thing, the dongle, remember the dongle that you got for the Nintendo DS?

43:37.840 --> 43:41.400
You can use that on your Wii, and that was something I had speculated a while back that

43:41.400 --> 43:43.440
you could probably do, so that's pretty cool.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.040
So that's something you can do.

43:45.040 --> 43:50.680
Also, Nintendo has announced they are going to provide an ethernet kit so that you can

43:50.680 --> 43:53.800
directly connect the console to a standard internet router.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.920
It's going to go from USB to ethernet.

43:56.920 --> 43:57.920
Probably.

43:57.920 --> 43:58.920
Yeah.

43:58.920 --> 44:02.720
Good job Nintendo in squelching that little cry of...

44:02.720 --> 44:05.200
I can't imagine those would be too expensive.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.200
I guess...

44:06.200 --> 44:07.200
Well, how much was the other dongle?

44:07.200 --> 44:08.200
$30?

44:08.200 --> 44:09.200
$35?

44:09.200 --> 44:10.200
It's like $25 or something.

44:10.200 --> 44:13.560
I'm going to be honest though, if you're going to be spending that kind of money to get your

44:13.560 --> 44:16.960
Wii online, you might want to think about just upgrading to a wireless router for your

44:16.960 --> 44:17.960
house.

44:17.960 --> 44:18.960
They're not that expensive these days.

44:18.960 --> 44:23.120
Yeah, wireless router, and if you really don't want to spend the money, just spend $25 on

44:23.120 --> 44:29.520
the wireless thing, because then that way you can use the Wi-Fi with your DS as well.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.000
And with your PSP, I think.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
So...

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Why not?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.040
Al Mullet brings up a good point.

44:34.040 --> 44:35.880
You can use the dongle on your Wii.

44:35.880 --> 44:38.600
Why doesn't that sound right?

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
I don't know.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
Good point.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.600
It sounds dirty.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.320
You know, I wonder what's kind of interesting about that?

44:44.320 --> 44:46.000
I wonder if you could use...

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
No, no, you wouldn't be able to use that.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.720
I was going to say use the Xbox 360 one, but that's $99, and that plugs into the Ethernet

44:53.720 --> 44:54.720
port anyways.

44:54.720 --> 44:55.720
All right, anyways, sorry.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.720
I digress.

44:56.720 --> 45:03.560
Now, there's been a lot of, in the past, people cheating in MMOs, basically hiring people

45:03.560 --> 45:10.120
to farm gold for them or to sell accounts to them that are high level and stuff like

45:10.120 --> 45:11.120
that.

45:11.120 --> 45:15.600
And they're kind of doing something like that on the Xbox 360 with someone's gamertag.

45:15.600 --> 45:16.600
That's right.

45:16.600 --> 45:23.280
Someone actually has their gamertag and their Xbox 360 hard drive up on eBay for sale.

45:23.280 --> 45:31.560
The gamertag rants6, who has, by the looks of it, over 30,000 points on their gamer score.

45:31.560 --> 45:34.760
From what I understand, this is actually the number one ranked gamer score on my gamer

45:34.760 --> 45:38.120
card net, I guess so.

45:38.120 --> 45:47.960
The guy's got 19 bids as of right now, as of when Xbox 360 updates reported it.

45:47.960 --> 45:53.160
They've actually, and the biddings end up to $5,000 already.

45:53.160 --> 45:59.400
And the reason why the guy's selling it, well, he's buying a PS3.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
Very interesting.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.400
Interesting.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.440
But why would you buy this just to have the gamer score?

46:03.440 --> 46:06.720
You know, this kind of goes along with another story that it didn't make our show roll for

46:06.720 --> 46:09.760
tonight, but surely a lot of you guys have heard about this.

46:09.760 --> 46:15.040
There's that company out there that's offering to inflate your gamer score or earn you 3,000

46:15.040 --> 46:19.160
gamer score points for, what was it, 3,000 points for 200 bucks, something like that.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.160
Why?

46:20.160 --> 46:21.160
Why would you do that?

46:21.160 --> 46:25.920
For about 10 bucks, you can do the same thing, and even more than that.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.720
And why you would even want to spend this kind of money.

46:27.720 --> 46:30.720
What do you mean, for 10 bucks, you can do the same thing?

46:30.720 --> 46:32.700
There's ways you can inflate your gamer score.

46:32.700 --> 46:33.700
You can cheat.

46:33.700 --> 46:34.700
How?

46:34.700 --> 46:35.700
How?

46:35.700 --> 46:36.700
Saves.

46:36.700 --> 46:37.700
Saves.

46:37.700 --> 46:38.700
Saves.

46:38.700 --> 46:39.700
Saves.

46:39.700 --> 46:40.700
Transferring game saves.

46:40.700 --> 46:41.700
Certain game saves on games will actually unlock achievement points for you.

46:41.700 --> 46:42.700
I got you.

46:42.700 --> 46:43.700
Okay.

46:43.700 --> 46:48.640
Or you can actually hack saves to do that as well.

46:48.640 --> 46:51.840
Why you would spend $300 on this?

46:51.840 --> 46:57.640
Why would you even give away your personal account to some stranger that's beyond me?

46:57.640 --> 46:58.640
I don't know.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.760
But I bet you anything, this is what they're doing, is they're just $300 for like 10 minutes

47:01.760 --> 47:02.760
of work.

47:02.760 --> 47:03.760
Oh, whoops.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.760
That story wasn't a show roll.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.760
It was the next thing I was supposed to go over.

47:07.760 --> 47:08.760
Oh, well.

47:08.760 --> 47:09.760
Well, excellent.

47:09.760 --> 47:10.840
We talked about it now.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.760
We prepped really hard for tonight's show, ladies and gentlemen.

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
Hooray.

47:15.760 --> 47:19.360
Well, that's pretty awesome that you mentioned that.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.760
Yeah, so let's just keep it moving.

47:21.760 --> 47:22.760
Anyways.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.320
I'm a psychic.

47:24.320 --> 47:29.200
You know, I'm glad that there's people out there actually concentrating on Xbox Live

47:29.200 --> 47:33.840
because it just wasn't really that annoying yet.

47:33.840 --> 47:39.180
And so now there's a brand new device out there for Smack Talking called Smack Talk.

47:39.180 --> 47:40.180
It's $29.99.

47:40.180 --> 47:47.440
It's basically a little device that plugs into your headphone port on your Xbox 360

47:47.440 --> 47:54.280
controller and it allows you to record five different Smack Talks into the device.

47:54.280 --> 48:00.160
So you can push the button at any time to release an automated, you know, blah, blah,

48:00.160 --> 48:01.160
blah.

48:01.160 --> 48:02.160
I pwned you, noob.

48:02.160 --> 48:06.680
You know, stuff like that, so hooray.

48:06.680 --> 48:10.240
Or what most people do is like, you know, take South Park recordings from that World

48:10.240 --> 48:14.280
of Warcraft episode, you know, total pwnage, and they just let him put it on the stupid

48:14.280 --> 48:15.280
thing.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.280
Yeah, so it comes through.

48:16.280 --> 48:18.040
You know, because, you know, it's all.

48:18.040 --> 48:21.600
You know what's going to be on mine when I get one of these.

48:21.600 --> 48:24.320
Draw four, bitch.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.320
Just kidding.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.080
I'm not getting one.

48:27.080 --> 48:30.700
I want to point out some of the chat in our chat room about the whole inflating your gamer

48:30.700 --> 48:31.700
score thing.

48:31.700 --> 48:36.800
El mullet has a method, one, sign up with Gamefly, two, rent four games at a time, three,

48:36.800 --> 48:39.440
play the games, four, earn mad points.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.600
And VX JasonXV agrees with that.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.160
Just freaking play.

48:43.160 --> 48:44.360
Seriously.

48:44.360 --> 48:48.000
And Jeremy Todd one wants to ask, Loki, if you could sell your account for $5,000, would

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
you?

48:49.000 --> 48:51.920
Sure would, because I'll just start a new one.

48:51.920 --> 48:53.440
Who cares?

48:53.440 --> 48:56.920
El mullet would like to share he's almost at 10,000 points through the Gamefly renting

48:56.920 --> 48:57.920
method.

48:57.920 --> 48:59.200
I think he does have the highest score on my friends list.

48:59.200 --> 49:02.240
I just don't have time to play that many games.

49:02.240 --> 49:07.240
I have that many games, too, to play, but I just don't have the time.

49:07.240 --> 49:12.360
SSJ wants to know what are the five pre-programmed things in the Smack Talk device.

49:12.360 --> 49:17.640
He says, FAG, FUCK, BITCH, OWNED, RETARD are the five that will be pre-programmed.

49:17.640 --> 49:18.640
Yay.

49:18.640 --> 49:21.640
He said FAG.

49:21.640 --> 49:27.520
Why, people, why?

49:27.520 --> 49:32.240
Well one of these games you may or may not be Smack Talking on is NBA Live 07, but I'll

49:32.240 --> 49:34.880
tell you where the Smack Talk's going right now.

49:34.880 --> 49:37.280
It's going to EA.

49:37.280 --> 49:43.920
Quote from this community, NBA Live community letter to EA from nbalive.org, quote, at one

49:43.920 --> 49:47.600
time EA was producing the best titles money could buy and one had little reason to look

49:47.600 --> 49:48.600
elsewhere.

49:48.600 --> 49:51.400
Now gamers have a sense that if you want the best, it's not EA.

49:51.400 --> 49:55.660
Whether it's looking at the NBA 2K series for our basketball game fix, users leaving

49:55.660 --> 49:59.720
Battlefield 2 because they feel the problems will never be addressed, or former FIFA players

49:59.720 --> 50:04.120
moving on to Pro Evolution winning XI, it's a sense that we are all sharing.

50:04.120 --> 50:08.480
We look at NBA Live over the last few years and we see the same basic game being re-released

50:08.480 --> 50:10.640
with new fancy features.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.640
You know, it's kind of funny because that's what all the non-sports games fans say about

50:13.640 --> 50:14.640
these games.

50:14.640 --> 50:19.000
You know, when they don't understand Madden 06, they go, it's just a roster update.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
It's even worse.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
It kind of is.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Even the fans are admitting it's just a roster update now.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
It's even worse with FIFA.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.360
FIFA, they release two games a year.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.440
The same elemental problems from the last few years are still there.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.880
Some have been tweaked, but the overall issue still exists.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.540
While there are plenty of new features, it gives the impression that EA is saying in

50:33.540 --> 50:36.660
response to the lingering issues, yeah, well hey, look at this.

50:36.660 --> 50:41.520
Be it an All-Star Weekend, Superstar Moves, or Dynasty editions, while those editions

50:41.520 --> 50:45.540
are nice to have, it is piling on a base that cannot support it instead of addressing the

50:45.540 --> 50:46.760
underlying fractures.

50:46.760 --> 50:50.720
EA is just constructing a new structure on the old crumbling foundation.

50:50.720 --> 50:55.760
On this letter, they put YouTube links to actual videos of the game being buggy.

50:55.760 --> 51:00.080
Very interesting rise up of the fan community against this, especially that part where they

51:00.080 --> 51:02.360
say they're all going to go play NBA 2K.

51:02.360 --> 51:03.360
That's pretty...

51:03.360 --> 51:04.360
Them's fighting words.

51:04.360 --> 51:08.700
You've got to talk in numbers because, you know, they keep buying the games, you know.

51:08.700 --> 51:12.240
I would be very interested to see if EA responds to this at all.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.240
Probably not.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.280
If they don't, that's...

51:15.280 --> 51:16.280
I don't know.

51:16.280 --> 51:20.760
I mean, you can probably lose these rabid fans on the internet and still make money

51:20.760 --> 51:25.920
on the game, but, you know, you need to do something about this free publicity or it's

51:25.920 --> 51:26.920
going to go away.

51:26.920 --> 51:27.920
Well, you know what?

51:27.920 --> 51:30.840
I mean, all EA seems to care about nowadays is money anyways.

51:30.840 --> 51:35.780
I mean, you saw the stories about how they're releasing, you know, Madden tutorial videos

51:35.780 --> 51:40.220
on how to throw passes and stuff, and they're charging on Xbox Live or, you know, Marketplace

51:40.220 --> 51:44.120
for this stuff, and it's basically stuff that should have been included in the game in the

51:44.120 --> 51:48.200
first place, and now they're charging, you know, premium content for this.

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
Fuck them.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.160
A lot of responses in our chat room.

51:52.160 --> 51:56.480
Jeremy Todd 1 says, EA's response, blame Canada, not us.

51:56.480 --> 52:00.360
Deep Man says, EA games is never going to lose money as long as they're publishing Maxis

52:00.360 --> 52:03.040
games.

52:03.040 --> 52:07.360
JoeShe16 says, EA will not acknowledge their own faults.

52:07.360 --> 52:14.000
Black Wolf says, EA's response, you already bought our game, bitches.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Interesting.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Yeah.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.040
I mean, you bought them, so whatever.

52:18.040 --> 52:21.640
I would just, you know, wait to play them or wait to buy them, you know, wait for the

52:21.640 --> 52:25.200
reviews to come out so you can find out if it's buggy or not because, you know, this

52:25.200 --> 52:30.560
year actually 2K7 got a way better review than live, so we'll see.

52:30.560 --> 52:31.720
All right.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.820
All this news about buggy games makes me angry.

52:33.820 --> 52:36.920
You shouldn't, you should release your game with minimal faults.

52:36.920 --> 52:40.680
I mean, there's going to be bugs and everything, but minimal faults and not try to patch it

52:40.680 --> 52:45.400
all in the back end, or just not playing patch at all like some companies do, so that makes

52:45.400 --> 52:46.400
us angry.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.400
So you know what that means.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.200
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

52:49.200 --> 52:53.200
You got it.

52:53.200 --> 53:04.480
Since Jamie's not here tonight, I will enter an FU to traffic on her behalf because that's

53:04.480 --> 53:05.840
her typical FU.

53:05.840 --> 53:08.920
Loki, should I be entering an FU to traffic on your behalf as well?

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
I don't know.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.400
I wasn't really driving that much this week.

53:12.400 --> 53:18.800
No, I'm going to say FU to stupid people that are trying to use the self-checkout because

53:18.800 --> 53:24.840
it actually takes longer for them to self-checkout than it would to check out normally, and I

53:24.840 --> 53:29.040
think that's kind of funny sometimes that, you know, they put self-checkout place, you

53:29.040 --> 53:34.760
know, machines in these stores that, you know, people are not smart enough to actually be

53:34.760 --> 53:36.920
able to use, like Walmart, for example.

53:36.920 --> 53:41.360
There should not be self-checkout at Walmart because, my God, these people don't understand

53:41.360 --> 53:47.000
anything other than hunting games, so please remove the self-checkout from Walmart or like

53:47.000 --> 53:51.080
block it off, you know, I can test, you know, you should have a smart card, you know.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.580
I'm a smart person.

53:52.580 --> 53:54.680
I should be able to use this device.

53:54.680 --> 53:55.680
You're dumb.

53:55.680 --> 53:56.680
Go away.

53:56.680 --> 54:00.480
I have a much lamer FU to enter in tonight.

54:00.480 --> 54:05.780
My FU would go to BeatMania 2DX, specifically doubles mode, because it's hard.

54:05.780 --> 54:11.000
It's really hard, like, you know, I can pass, I'm okay at the regular seven-key mode, but,

54:11.000 --> 54:14.800
well, actually I've lost a lot of skill because I haven't played a lot regularly, so FU did

54:14.800 --> 54:19.760
that, the fact that there's no working BeatMania 2DX arcade machine in town anymore, but I

54:19.760 --> 54:20.760
really suck at doubles.

54:20.760 --> 54:23.560
I mean, I've been trying to use your controller to play doubles, and I passed, like, some

54:23.560 --> 54:25.040
fours, but that's about it.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.240
I suck.

54:26.240 --> 54:30.360
It's very humbling to go from being able to pass sevens and some flashing sevens to, like,

54:30.360 --> 54:32.800
oh shit, I can only play fours now because I'm doing doubles.

54:32.800 --> 54:39.440
Well, I can only play fours, and some fours, not even all of them, because I suck at doubles.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.840
Of course, the people that don't play BeatMania that listen to this show is like, what the

54:41.840 --> 54:42.840
hell is he talking about?

54:42.840 --> 54:44.340
What the hell is that?

54:44.340 --> 54:47.280
It's so hard, but anyways.

54:47.280 --> 54:51.960
Some interesting stuff coming out about NBA 2K7, actually, for the PlayStation 3, which

54:51.960 --> 54:54.680
will be coming out around launch.

54:54.680 --> 54:58.680
What's interesting, and, you know, you might remember before when they were talking about

54:58.680 --> 55:02.960
the PlayStation 3 how it's going to support up to seven controllers on one system, because

55:02.960 --> 55:11.240
it has the limitations of Bluetooth, but NBA 2K7 will support seven players offline, which

55:11.240 --> 55:14.040
is pretty interesting.

55:14.040 --> 55:15.520
Seven players is kind of an odd number.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.840
I would think six players would be good enough, since it's, you know, three on three.

55:18.840 --> 55:21.000
Do any of you have that many friends?

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
I don't have that many friends.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.840
I have four controllers, and I never play with four friends, because no one wants to

55:25.840 --> 55:26.840
play.

55:26.840 --> 55:27.840
It's so lonely.

55:27.840 --> 55:31.880
All in all, I'll come over and play, but not NBA, because I suck at those games.

55:31.880 --> 55:33.780
Double dribble for life, man.

55:33.780 --> 55:34.780
Double dribble.

55:34.780 --> 55:38.480
But, see, like, three on three would be cool for, like, NBA Street or something like that,

55:38.480 --> 55:44.520
you know, where they actually have three on three, but seven players is kind of, you know,

55:44.520 --> 55:47.360
so you have three on one and four on the other.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.960
They should have one person that's the ref.

55:49.960 --> 55:50.960
That'd be funny.

55:50.960 --> 55:51.960
Or the mascot.

55:51.960 --> 55:52.960
Or the cheerleader.

55:52.960 --> 55:53.960
Cheerleader.

55:53.960 --> 55:54.960
Excellent.

55:54.960 --> 55:55.960
That'd be cool.

55:55.960 --> 56:01.320
So, new peripherals are coming out for the PlayStation 3.

56:01.320 --> 56:05.480
Of course, I can't remember if we mentioned it last week, but the controller's being named

56:05.480 --> 56:06.480
the Sixaxis.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.440
Didn't we talk a little bit about that last week?

56:08.440 --> 56:11.680
I can't remember if that was last week or not, but, of course, the controller's officially

56:11.680 --> 56:15.460
been dubbed the Sixaxis, and IGN's posted some very nice little screenshots of all these

56:15.460 --> 56:19.840
devices that are coming out, and, by the way, have you been to GameStop recently?

56:19.840 --> 56:24.000
I saw some big banner ads for PlayStation 3 and Wii in the store, like, kind of place-holding

56:24.000 --> 56:27.080
where they're going to put them up on the wall when they get those systems in.

56:27.080 --> 56:28.080
Not yet.

56:28.080 --> 56:31.040
You can see a nice, big, clear picture of the PlayStation 3 controller on there.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.240
And then the memory card USB.

56:32.240 --> 56:35.760
Well, I don't really need to see a big, clear, you know, controller picture because I've

56:35.760 --> 56:36.760
touched it.

56:36.760 --> 56:37.760
Whatever.

56:37.760 --> 56:38.760
Whatever.

56:38.760 --> 56:39.760
I'm just saying.

56:39.760 --> 56:40.760
I'm just saying.

56:40.760 --> 56:41.760
If you want to see one.

56:41.760 --> 56:42.760
I like the remote, though.

56:42.760 --> 56:43.760
Yeah, the remote's pretty cool.

56:43.760 --> 56:44.760
The remote has, like, 10,000 buttons.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.880
It looks like one of those all-in-one style remotes.

56:46.880 --> 56:49.160
Looks like a Harmony remote for the 360.

56:49.160 --> 56:52.080
I'm still weirded out by the whole Spider-Man font on the PlayStation 3, though.

56:52.080 --> 56:55.760
Did you like that remote that they had, the Harmony one, made by Logitech?

56:55.760 --> 56:56.760
You're like, that remote's $150?

56:56.760 --> 56:57.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.600
I still remember seeing that at Best Buy or whatever.

56:59.600 --> 57:00.600
I was like, what the?

57:00.600 --> 57:03.440
You don't need to spend $150 on a remote unless it will never get lost.

57:03.440 --> 57:07.120
But if it's that big, it probably won't ever get lost, so maybe it would be worth it.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.120
I don't know.

57:08.120 --> 57:10.120
It should be, like, attached to the PS3.

57:10.120 --> 57:15.480
Anyways, one thing that Sony's been combating, other than a lot of bad press, is that the

57:15.480 --> 57:19.920
PlayStation 3 is overheating and having, you know, some sort of a similar problem as the

57:19.920 --> 57:22.020
Xbox 360 did.

57:22.020 --> 57:26.280
And this is basically coming from Tokyo Game Show because a lot of the units were overheating.

57:26.280 --> 57:28.480
But from what I heard about Tokyo Game Show, that place wasn't air-conditioned.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.360
Wouldn't that fucking suck?

57:30.360 --> 57:36.440
I mean, as hot as it is in, you know, E3, let alone without AC, fuck that.

57:36.440 --> 57:37.440
I wouldn't go.

57:37.440 --> 57:38.440
That's a good deterrent, though.

57:38.440 --> 57:39.440
They should do that.

57:39.440 --> 57:40.440
Turn off the air.

57:40.440 --> 57:41.440
But, um...

57:41.440 --> 57:43.840
Then the place would smell so awful.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.880
Oh, it probably does anyways.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.800
So anyways, so yeah.

57:48.800 --> 57:53.600
Basically they were having overheating problems at Tokyo Game Show because, you know, the

57:53.600 --> 57:57.280
temperature of the building, which is so high.

57:57.280 --> 58:01.200
What's interesting, though, is I didn't hear about any overheating problems on the 360

58:01.200 --> 58:05.800
or you know, the Wii's or anything like that from Tokyo Game Show, so...

58:05.800 --> 58:06.800
I don't know.

58:06.800 --> 58:07.800
I guess we'll see at launch.

58:07.800 --> 58:08.800
This is why I don't...

58:08.800 --> 58:09.800
I don't know.

58:09.800 --> 58:12.800
I don't know if I want to buy a PlayStation 3 at launch.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.720
It's just too much stuff to get wrong.

58:14.720 --> 58:19.280
Plus, that thing weighs about 15 pounds from what I heard.

58:19.280 --> 58:23.200
I've already decided I'm not getting one to launch because there's nothing coming out

58:23.200 --> 58:24.400
at launch I'm interested in playing.

58:24.400 --> 58:25.400
Exactly.

58:25.400 --> 58:26.400
Sorry, Sony fans.

58:26.400 --> 58:27.400
That's just how I honestly feel about it.

58:27.400 --> 58:28.400
There's nothing I really want at launch.

58:28.400 --> 58:30.240
It's all about the games for me, you know.

58:30.240 --> 58:33.200
Maybe if they had a Twisted Metal or maybe, I don't know.

58:33.200 --> 58:34.200
Oh, I don't know.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.200
Final Fantasy 13 or something.

58:35.200 --> 58:37.400
Final Fantasy 13 would be cool, but to be honest...

58:37.400 --> 58:40.900
Well, then that would be kind of stupid seeing as 12's coming out at the end of October,

58:40.900 --> 58:43.200
but still, you know, you still get my point.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.440
There needs to be something...

58:45.440 --> 58:48.520
And if there is something like that, then I need to be hearing about it real soon.

58:48.520 --> 58:51.400
What do you think about those rumors that, of course, you know, this is nothing new,

58:51.400 --> 58:54.080
but that the launch is actually going to be delayed?

58:54.080 --> 58:56.160
They seem to be really picking up steam this week.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
I wouldn't be surprised.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.680
I mean, think about what happened in the spring.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.320
Oh, yeah, it's coming out.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.320
It's coming out in spring.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.320
It's coming out in spring.

59:03.320 --> 59:04.320
It's summer now.

59:04.320 --> 59:05.320
Oh, yeah, it's not coming out in spring.

59:05.320 --> 59:07.320
I forgot to mention.

59:07.320 --> 59:09.160
Oh, yeah.

59:09.160 --> 59:10.160
That sucks.

59:10.160 --> 59:15.200
I wouldn't be surprised if I see the news story for it, but right now I'm going to expect

59:15.200 --> 59:21.480
it to come out November 17th, and when it doesn't, I'll just be like, well, that's nothing

59:21.480 --> 59:27.560
new, but if they fucking miss this year's Christmas, that ain't good.

59:27.560 --> 59:28.560
That's not good at all.

59:28.560 --> 59:31.680
They're going to have another Neo Geo on their hands.

59:31.680 --> 59:32.680
All right.

59:32.680 --> 59:36.160
Well, there's some additional information out there on the PlayStation 3's interface

59:36.160 --> 59:37.160
this week.

59:37.160 --> 59:43.120
There's a video that shows up on GameTrailers.com, and it was a video that was taken during Tokyo

59:43.120 --> 59:44.120
Game Show.

59:44.120 --> 59:47.440
The video will show the web browser that's integrated into PlayStation 3.

59:47.440 --> 59:50.920
Now, there's something 360 doesn't have on it that makes PS3 stand out a little bit.

59:50.920 --> 59:51.920
I'm surprised that they don't have that.

59:51.920 --> 59:53.920
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised, too.

59:53.920 --> 59:58.440
NBA 2007 is in the video running at 1080p at 60 frames a second.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:03.500
It shows a little bit of the PSP connectivity, some of the photo browser stuff, and the visualizer

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.320
that goes with the music.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.400
Really think PlayStation Portable interface, that's the PlayStation 3 interface.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.640
Well, at least it's consistent.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:19.640
It is, but straight down to pop the game in, you have the background change and the little

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.680
animation icon video or whatever.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.120
Yeah, same thing, so not a huge surprise.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.720
What is kind of surprising, though, is that the PSP, there's been a lot of stuff going

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.920
on in the homebrew community for the PSP, including, and this is very interesting, a

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:43.480
brand new device that someone's actually creating called the PSP Touch Me.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.240
Where did the PSP touch you?

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.080
Show me on the doll where it touched you.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:55.320
It's actually going to be a device that plugs into the USB port and puts kind of a glass

01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.920
screen over the actual screen, and you'll be using a stylus with it as a touch screen.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:08.120
It's kind of interesting to see homebrew people come out with this stuff, thinking of ideas

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.880
that Sony themselves probably didn't even consider.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.000
Even if Sony themselves came out tomorrow and said, hey, we're going to sell this touch

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.320
screen adapter for the PSP, would it, because like you say, the stuff has to be out there

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.120
for the games to be made for it.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.680
That's why peripherals traditionally have not done very well, because they weren't very

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.520
well supported on the game front, so why would the PSP release a touch screen officially

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.640
if no third party games are going to support it?

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.600
I don't think they would anyways.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.020
They might be accused of copying.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.920
So what the hell can I use this for?

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.000
Homebrew games, which is only going to support some homebrew games right now, and it's designed

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.800
to use as an add-on, and it will cost you $56.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.320
No word on when it's going to be released, but it looks pretty cool.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.200
I don't know.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.000
I'm not buying one, but it's kind of neat.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.080
I think it's neat that the community came together and built that.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.280
I think that's the neatest part of it for me.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.440
They built a GPS device for this thing already, so...

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.920
Isn't there an official one now?

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.800
There is an official GPS device that's coming out later this year.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.360
Could that happen where Sony decides to make an official one, or would they not do that

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:24.040
out of fear of being called Nintendo copiers?

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.680
I don't think they would.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.520
I think they think it's gimmicky.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520
They didn't get any.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.080
They did die twice, so I don't know.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.600
But I mean, look at some of the cool stuff homebrew is doing.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:40.080
They released a custom firmware this week also, a 2.71 firmware that runs homebrew games.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:47.880
So you can run your current games right now for the PSP and homebrew without any modification.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:53.200
The only thing is you can't upgrade yours using an official upgrader that comes out

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.920
later on, but you can always downgrade it back to 1.5 and then upgrade again if you

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920
really wanted to.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.240
But come on, they've broken every firmware that they come out with, so that's pretty

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.240
awesome though.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.680
That's going to start to bring this segment to a close.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.680
We're going to get into the DDR previews first.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.120
We have been premiering over the past several weeks some new tracks from Dance Dance Revolution

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.380
Ultramix 4 coming out for the Xbox very soon.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.380
Later this month, right?

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.380
This is last we heard.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.380
Yeah.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.380
Don't know.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.380
Wait, what?

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.380
Ultramix 4.

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.320
Oh, no, no, that's in the middle of November 9th.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.880
Oh, I thought it was this month.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.880
No, November.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.880
Well, shoot.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.880
Well, that's all right.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.840
It seems like there's been a lot of good reaction to the songs we've been playing so far, so

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.800
it'll be well worth the wait for a lot of folks, I think.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.360
People are still busy with Supernova trying to figure out how to beat Pizza Box and all

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360
that.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.880
I completely forgot the mention about stuff about Universe and the price of it, which

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.560
you know, and I'm going to say this is kind of preliminary right now because I don't...

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.940
This is not coming to us from official sources.

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.240
This news that Loki's about to give is not from an official source.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.960
It's from his distribution channels.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960
Yes, exactly.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:10.360
Universe, $49.99 for the game by itself, $79.99 for the game plus a pad, which I don't understand

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.360
why they would do a by-the-self version of the game seeing as there's no pad for the

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.160
360 yet, so I don't know.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.440
But hypothetically, the pad's going to have to be USB, right?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440
It is USB.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:28.280
So does that mean if I happen to own a Red Octane pad that had the USB for my StepMania,

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.040
then I could use that on the 360?

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040
Maybe.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040
Maybe.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.040
Maybe.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.520
Well, I mean, is it going to show into your system as two different games that there are

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.800
not two different games?

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.080
Well, it might not know.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.840
Depends on how it maps out because, you know, that's compatible with the PC, you know, where

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:50.420
you can map the keys for a USB controller, but you can't just plug any USB controller

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:55.720
into the 360 and it will automatically work, so whether it supports it or not.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.320
Well, take it with a little bit of a grain of salt, but those look to be the preliminary

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320
prices for the game.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.080
Yeah, it's just like BeatMania for the US, remember how we announced originally that

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.400
it had two SKUs, one without the controller, one with the controller, and then later on

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.200
they decided we're just going to do the one with the controller because no one has the

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.440
controller yet in the United States, which is stupid, but yeah.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440
That makes sense.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.440
All right.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.960
Well, let's get into some previews from DDR Universe, which is coming out sometime this

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.800
winter and DDR UltraMix 4.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:29.240
We're going to start it off tonight with a song from DDR UltraMix 4, and our good buddy

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.240
Midihead also does songs under the name Monolithic, in fact, I believe that was the first name

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.480
he was using, and we call him our good buddy because he actually does the intro to our

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.840
show here at Orange Launch Radio.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.240
If you ever wondered where that little ditty at the beginning of our program came from,

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.240
that was actually written by him.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:48.320
Well, he has a song that's going to be in DDR UltraMix 4, and it's called Arms, the

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.560
Alpha Omega Extended Mix, and we're going to play it for you right now on the DDR Sneak

01:05:52.560 --> 01:06:14.040
Eeks Orange Launch Radio.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:38.240
It doesn't take so long, running in the gauntlet of my fears, drained of all my energy, slippin'

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:58.160
in the sea of all my tears, feelin' what is cold as I start to freeze, shoutin' out for

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:15.960
help as I go down, deep inside this liquid grave, the water rushes in, I start to drown,

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:33.760
you reach for my hand and hope to say, I looked upon you, concerned was in your eyes, your

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:49.680
tears, they hurt my back, seized me from sorrow, and dried the pain away, so I could

01:07:49.680 --> 01:08:07.920
find another day, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:24.800
turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:42.560
got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:59.440
turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:23.280

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:51.280

01:09:51.280 --> 01:10:19.280
