00:14.356 --> 00:25.865
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, October 8, 2006, rumors about next-gen sales at GameStop fly around the internet, angry NBA Live fans write a letter to EA, and a popular DS mascot moves to the PSP.

00:32.682 --> 00:37.327
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.367 --> 00:42.352
[SPEAKER_01]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.773 --> 00:43.754
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.914 --> 00:44.935
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know me as Sky.

00:45.035 --> 00:46.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining me, not tonight...

00:47.416 --> 00:48.057
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

01:12.267 --> 01:13.548
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody suggested that was a stupid idea.

01:36.141 --> 01:37.621
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just start answering you with a 10 second delay.

01:37.661 --> 01:38.022
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?

02:03.550 --> 02:05.072
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:22.058 --> 02:24.580
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess our chat room is the co-host substitute tonight.

02:24.680 --> 02:32.587
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to join our chat room and you are listening live here on Sunday night, head on over to www.orangelearnsradio.com and click on chat.

02:33.147 --> 02:35.129
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into games and start it off.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.451
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, talking about how was your gaming week?

02:37.571 --> 02:39.412
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was great.

02:40.173 --> 02:44.137
[SPEAKER_03]: I played lots of, actually a lot of Saints Row.

02:44.357 --> 02:46.999
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got the 20 hour achievement for that game.

02:47.823 --> 02:52.747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun, you know, and there's actually a whole section of the game I really hadn't explored yet.

02:53.528 --> 02:57.591
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really fun game, so I've been playing that, actually playing through some of the storyline.

02:58.351 --> 03:03.775
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those games that you are allowed to cheat in it, but you can't get achievement points doing it.

03:04.196 --> 03:10.420
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it feels good to actually play through the game, and to be honest, the game's not that hard anyways, at least not the part that I'm at.

03:12.422 --> 03:13.443
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, it's pretty fun.

03:13.543 --> 03:16.125
[SPEAKER_03]: And the storyline, I like the storyline so far to it, so...

03:16.730 --> 03:18.752
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's worth checking out.

03:19.252 --> 03:24.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I've been actually... Well, I've been trying to play some PlayStation 2 games, but that didn't happen this week.

03:25.377 --> 03:27.118
[SPEAKER_03]: I have them all lined up to play next week.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Even games I shouldn't be having to play next week, I will be playing next week.

03:33.423 --> 03:33.884
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

03:34.224 --> 03:34.564
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

03:35.865 --> 03:38.307
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so lots of good stuff.

03:38.948 --> 03:44.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, you know, there's a lot of people out there that develop games that really leak stuff to the internet pretty early, so...

03:46.488 --> 03:50.392
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, you know, just the usual... Real quick comment from the chatroom.

03:50.632 --> 03:53.094
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshi16 says, The ending to Saints sucks.

03:54.075 --> 03:55.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you gotten that far where you saw the ending?

03:55.977 --> 03:56.858
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I don't care.

03:57.038 --> 03:58.039
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if the ending sucks?

03:58.059 --> 03:58.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if your main character doesn't talk, so, I mean, how great can it be?

04:02.403 --> 04:04.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just... They should have him do a monologue.

04:04.645 --> 04:08.549
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be hilarious, because he'd just stand there going... You know...

04:09.221 --> 04:11.462
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of video game endings suck now that I think about it.

04:11.562 --> 04:13.143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Grand Theft Auto.

04:13.183 --> 04:20.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto's ending sucked, and you beat it so you can have lots of rockets at your crib so you can go blow up shit.

04:21.406 --> 04:22.186
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did today.

04:22.246 --> 04:36.632
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing, and I blew up cop cars and stuff, and then I got on the train tracks, and I blew up the L train, and the train fell down, and usually you can't jump off the tracks without dying, but since there's a big train pileup next to the tracks, I just jumped on the trains and ran down.

04:37.032 --> 04:37.352
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

04:38.078 --> 04:38.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

05:07.748 --> 05:10.033
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's their mistake, that's fine.

05:10.073 --> 05:14.623
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the whole duping glitch in Oblivion, not really cheating because it was there.

05:14.763 --> 05:15.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not put a code in.

05:16.118 --> 05:19.099
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the chatroom is talking about video game endings, right?

05:19.279 --> 05:22.261
[SPEAKER_01]: And JeremyTodd1 says, Who cares if the ending sucks?

05:22.301 --> 05:24.902
[SPEAKER_01]: If the whole other part of the game is good, who gives a shit about the ending?

05:25.422 --> 05:31.704
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joshi16 kind of seems to follow up with that, saying in response to his comment earlier, I was just saying, I still like the game.

05:32.285 --> 05:34.005
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if the ending sucked, huh?

05:34.105 --> 05:34.546
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

05:34.586 --> 05:37.507
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the ending sucks, you just continue playing in multiplayer.

05:38.107 --> 05:42.849
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, SmartAsses starts its mouth off in the chatroom here, saying,

05:43.715 --> 05:44.195
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?

05:44.395 --> 05:47.576
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Joshi16 says, the ending to Pac-Man sucks also.

05:48.896 --> 05:49.956
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that just restart?

05:50.617 --> 05:52.397
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you get a half board at the very end.

05:52.417 --> 05:53.157
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually look it up.

05:53.477 --> 06:07.340
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a Wikipedia marathon this week reading about different video games on Wikipedia, and one of them I was reading about was Pac-Man, and they actually have a screenshot of the 256th or 255th board, the one that crashes out the machine, and it's only like a half board.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.181
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funky looking.

06:09.521 --> 06:10.301
[SPEAKER_01]: Look it up on Wikipedia.

06:10.836 --> 06:11.536
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:36.308 --> 06:49.957
[SPEAKER_03]: The main thing that comes down to these stupid games that use the camera for movement, like the eye toy, is that in your typical gaming environment, you do not have a giant white screen behind you to move in front of.

06:50.678 --> 06:58.523
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what the fuck environment they test this stuff in, which I'm assuming has a giant white screen behind them, but that does not work in the real world.

06:58.923 --> 07:04.607
[SPEAKER_03]: So stop making games that don't work in the real world, in just a lab environment.

07:04.929 --> 07:06.490
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:34.680 --> 07:36.862
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX Live Arcade Games

07:58.376 --> 07:59.058
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:04.793 --> 08:05.393
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:34.373 --> 08:43.435
[SPEAKER_01]: The other things I like about the camera is video chat is actually really smooth and pretty good looking for the camera, provided you don't get a defective one like Loki had at first.

08:43.775 --> 08:49.877
[SPEAKER_01]: I think video chat's pretty awesome, and it's fast, and it's pretty clear.

08:50.257 --> 08:57.339
[SPEAKER_01]: Some listener I was video chatting with tonight, and they didn't have a camera, so I couldn't see theirs, but they said that I looked really good.

08:57.979 --> 08:59.499
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I always look good.

08:59.519 --> 09:03.100
[SPEAKER_01]: We were video chatting earlier in the week, Loki, and it was really smooth.

09:03.570 --> 09:06.052
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus I made your controller vibrate a lot for no good reason.

09:06.613 --> 09:07.514
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a little bit, actually.

09:07.614 --> 09:08.054
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a little bit?

09:08.374 --> 09:12.178
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then we'll have to video chat later on tonight and I'll just hold down the R button and shake it a lot.

09:12.218 --> 09:12.718
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stupid.

09:13.259 --> 09:13.799
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it to your wife.

09:14.080 --> 09:14.540
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll enjoy that.

09:16.502 --> 09:19.284
[SPEAKER_01]: The things I don't like about the camera is Totem Ball.

09:20.465 --> 09:27.832
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, if you're going to get a camera just so you can play Totem Ball because it's free on Xbox Live Arcade, not a selling point.

09:28.391 --> 09:29.352
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:57.896 --> 10:00.838
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I can't control it the way I want it to, it's not that great

10:15.860 --> 10:17.321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's not very fun.

10:17.421 --> 10:20.504
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot get the damn thing to work, and it's frustrating.

10:20.804 --> 10:25.248
[SPEAKER_03]: And after about two minutes playing this thing, I'm like, fuck this, I'll go play something else.

10:25.888 --> 10:28.991
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, if I paid for that, I'd be pissed off.

10:29.291 --> 10:41.441
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank God that in, you know, I think with the extra development time that they had, because this game, you know, did come out a couple weeks after the camera, you know, that they would get it right, but apparently, no, they didn't, so...

10:42.708 --> 10:46.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, I guess they were like, fuck it, who cares, it's free.

10:46.651 --> 10:51.835
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say this, I did enjoy the pinball minigame that comes with it quite a bit where you use your hands as the flippers.

10:51.875 --> 10:53.596
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of just like a one gimmick thing.

10:53.916 --> 10:59.400
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pinball game did not frustrate me nearly as much as the actual game itself trying to control around.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.623
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pinball one's easy because you just wave your right hand and it moves the right flipper.

11:02.643 --> 11:04.704
[SPEAKER_01]: You wave your left hand and it moves the left flipper.

11:05.005 --> 11:09.348
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was more entertaining for me than the actual game that was there.

11:10.658 --> 11:11.738
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried the pinball yet.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.379
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like Totem Ball is too popular amongst my friends, too.

11:14.499 --> 11:21.201
[SPEAKER_01]: I got three really easy achievements that aren't hard to get, and I think I have the highest gamer score on Totem Ball of anybody on my friends list.

11:21.901 --> 11:25.122
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about 70 people on my friends list, and about 10 or 15 of them have the camera.

11:26.522 --> 11:33.124
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what game I actually did play, because I know it supports the camera, was Bankshot Billiards 2.

11:33.684 --> 11:34.024
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that?

11:34.464 --> 11:35.644
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting?

11:35.724 --> 11:38.785
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was some 3D support where you can change the camera angle or something.

11:39.588 --> 11:40.729
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:10.109 --> 12:13.031
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but luckily I got that with my live kit.

12:13.651 --> 12:15.593
[SPEAKER_03]: My one-year live kit came with it.

12:16.893 --> 12:18.514
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't pay $15 for that thing.

12:18.534 --> 12:21.636
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing, maybe $5, but I don't know.

12:21.816 --> 12:22.136
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

12:23.477 --> 12:23.917
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

12:24.237 --> 12:26.739
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to mention some chat comments here.

12:26.799 --> 12:28.420
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of them going on here.

12:29.060 --> 12:31.421
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly a lot of people sharing about their gaming week.

12:32.402 --> 12:32.802
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

12:35.467 --> 12:36.988
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad I can't pronounce this name.

12:37.348 --> 12:40.530
[SPEAKER_01]: Tacte Pueri, I think that is, says Totem Ball wasn't free.

12:40.550 --> 12:41.851
[SPEAKER_01]: You paid for it with the camera.

12:42.931 --> 12:44.732
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess essentially you can kind of look at it that way.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.313
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

12:46.873 --> 12:48.574
[SPEAKER_01]: And RavensDolphin says along the same lines.

12:48.634 --> 12:49.575
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, guy, it is free.

12:49.595 --> 12:50.355
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't complain.

12:50.555 --> 12:52.116
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about Totem Ball.

12:52.236 --> 13:04.303
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I didn't understand, though, that they threw in there with the 12-month camera bundle, which is the one I ended up getting because I got to swap it out at GameStop for, you know, they only have the gear bundle left.

13:05.170 --> 13:12.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Some idiot employee gave it to me at equal cost, so I got a free year of live for... No, free, actually.

13:13.416 --> 13:16.618
[SPEAKER_03]: That was interesting, but it came with Robotron.

13:16.958 --> 13:22.601
[SPEAKER_03]: I already own Robotron, but that's the dumbest... Why would you throw that in there?

13:22.642 --> 13:24.002
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even support the camera.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't get that at all.

13:25.623 --> 13:31.247
[SPEAKER_01]: For the live element, being able to play on live, it's a cheap little game that they can demonstrate the live.

13:31.267 --> 13:31.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Put in like...

13:33.083 --> 13:35.326
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, one of the, like, Hardwood Hearts or something.

13:35.666 --> 13:37.248
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of the other games that supports the camera.

13:37.268 --> 13:40.612
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that they would want camera-supported games with the camera.

13:41.273 --> 13:41.573
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

13:42.254 --> 13:42.555
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

13:43.676 --> 13:44.917
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else I do with my game of the week.

13:44.957 --> 13:45.798
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, not a whole lot else.

13:45.819 --> 13:47.701
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much the only new game I played.

13:49.523 --> 13:50.624
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm racking my brain here.

13:50.644 --> 13:52.507
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of anything else really new that I played.

13:52.607 --> 13:52.707
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

13:53.072 --> 13:53.993
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll think of one I played.

13:54.233 --> 13:57.815
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back because of all the love I was giving to this game recently on the show.

13:58.196 --> 14:05.321
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back and found a copy of Civilization 1 and I got it running on the computer and I took over the world once this week.

14:05.481 --> 14:05.901
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

14:06.241 --> 14:06.822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's excellent.

14:06.982 --> 14:08.883
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite games of all time right there.

14:08.903 --> 14:15.828
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost bought Civ 4 for the PC but I needed to have a price drop first because those Civ games always drop in price later on.

14:16.249 --> 14:17.309
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm waiting for that.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was playing also Cooking Mama.

14:19.751 --> 14:20.432
[SPEAKER_03]: How was Cooking Mama?

14:20.452 --> 14:21.032
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually great.

14:21.325 --> 14:22.246
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:49.392 --> 14:51.793
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them, they have a really short attention span for me.

14:52.373 --> 14:55.614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not anything I can go back and play and play and play over and over again.

14:55.934 --> 15:00.976
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Grand Theft Auto, I can go back and play that any time, and it's still interesting to me.

15:02.056 --> 15:02.376
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

15:03.477 --> 15:03.757
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

15:03.857 --> 15:05.017
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it for my gaming week.

15:05.057 --> 15:05.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else for you?

15:06.698 --> 15:08.238
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's all I had.

15:08.438 --> 15:08.658
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

15:08.938 --> 15:15.561
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the chat room was asking us about this, and since we don't have Jamie here tonight and this segment's a little bit shorter because of it, we got a little time to talk about this.

15:17.051 --> 15:18.953
[SPEAKER_01]: Video gaming showed up in a couple shows this week.

15:19.474 --> 15:25.040
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, one that was very well known that a lot of people saw was the South Park episode with World of Warcraft.

15:25.100 --> 15:25.661
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think?

15:25.681 --> 15:27.483
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think of the South Park episode with World of Warcraft?

15:27.503 --> 15:28.524
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty funny.

15:28.884 --> 15:33.269
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably didn't get a lot of the humor in it because I don't play World of Warcraft, but it was still funny, though.

15:33.509 --> 15:34.170
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hilarious.

15:34.531 --> 15:36.513
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was really well done, but I don't know.

15:36.553 --> 15:37.874
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I just kind of wish...

15:39.275 --> 15:53.603
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge South Park fan, and I love the movie, it's one of my favorite movies ever, and I love a lot of the other, you know, stuff they do, but this episode for me, it just wasn't that same satire that I like out of the, you know, other stuff.

15:53.643 --> 15:55.384
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I think the problem was just the plot.

15:55.444 --> 15:56.645
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't really like the plot.

15:56.765 --> 16:00.427
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed a little, like, I don't know, I just kind of wish they could have, you know, they could have done something.

16:00.447 --> 16:08.031
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I read a comment on one of the gaming sites where other people were talking about this, where, you know, maybe Cartman could have been running a string of Chinese gold farmers or something, you know, that would have been funny.

16:08.927 --> 16:12.330
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I didn't, I don't know, it was a little cheesy.

16:12.350 --> 16:24.739
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they did a very good job integrating, I can't talk tonight, the game with the show, but because of that, it kind of felt like an infomercial to me.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.082
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt more like an infomercial, unless it's satire.

16:28.122 --> 16:30.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even better, here's a better description of it.

16:30.184 --> 16:36.589
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like someone making a mockument of the World of Warcraft game set to the audio track of South Park.

16:38.170 --> 16:38.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically.

16:38.792 --> 16:38.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.794
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if you were to take a classic episode and just kind of make a mocky mock from it.

16:43.174 --> 16:47.416
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, the funniest part of the whole show was, Mom, bathroom, bathroom.

16:48.677 --> 16:51.158
[SPEAKER_01]: But just my mind's in the gutter like that.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.659
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that made me laugh really hard.

16:52.679 --> 17:00.583
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people, you know, some people are bitching about, you know, oh, the horde wasn't in it or, oh, their characters weren't the right levels.

17:01.063 --> 17:05.786
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're probably complaining about these types of things, you're probably exactly who these guys are trying to –

17:06.547 --> 17:07.387
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

17:33.317 --> 17:33.837
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

17:56.241 --> 17:57.442
[SPEAKER_01]: Making satire of Call of Duty.

17:57.502 --> 17:59.464
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you just got season one and two of The Office.

17:59.484 --> 17:59.764
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you?

17:59.884 --> 18:01.165
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to borrow them.

18:01.185 --> 18:03.607
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just different shows, except for the very, very first episode.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.869
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same plot in the British one and the American one.

18:07.910 --> 18:10.973
[SPEAKER_03]: We got up through the second episode, which is Diversity Day.

18:11.153 --> 18:12.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

18:12.994 --> 18:13.535
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always funny.

18:14.275 --> 18:14.535
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

18:15.136 --> 18:21.321
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, I appreciate that the chat room is going to link me to a torrent of The Office, but I still have it on the DVR.

18:21.341 --> 18:21.581
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just...

18:22.165 --> 18:22.965
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:45.389 --> 18:51.555
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're turning into TV talk, so we better get back to... I mean, a lot of nerds like their TV.

18:52.175 --> 18:54.197
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a Link-type character in it.

18:54.277 --> 18:58.280
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's game-related a little bit, so... Whatever.

18:58.701 --> 18:59.061
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

19:00.255 --> 19:01.936
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

19:01.956 --> 19:03.197
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a whole lot tonight.

19:03.257 --> 19:04.718
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, Jamie will be back this week.

19:04.778 --> 19:05.659
[SPEAKER_01]: She's out this week.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.800
[SPEAKER_01]: The DDR previews are continuing tonight.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.761
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear those a little later in this segment.

19:10.322 --> 19:15.405
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give a quick shout-out to one of our listeners who's in chat tonight, El Mullet, who hasn't been there for a long, long time.

19:15.825 --> 19:21.009
[SPEAKER_01]: But he says he wanted to come to chat tonight because he's getting married next Sunday, so he wanted to kind of have his...

19:23.505 --> 19:28.267
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a good last Sunday night hurrah of single life here in the chat room, so I appreciate that.

19:28.287 --> 19:28.767
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing the shirt.

19:28.827 --> 19:29.207
[SPEAKER_01]: You are!

19:29.487 --> 19:30.947
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki's wearing the shirt we bought him.

19:30.967 --> 19:32.428
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie and I got him a shirt before he got married.

19:32.468 --> 19:35.809
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Game Over, with the husband frowning and the wife smiling.

19:36.109 --> 19:36.389
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.009
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably seen it on the internet, other places.

19:38.049 --> 19:38.690
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Target.

19:38.990 --> 19:40.210
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of people have it.

19:40.550 --> 19:40.890
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

19:42.271 --> 19:42.531
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

19:44.992 --> 19:45.312
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

19:45.392 --> 19:49.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Any advice for the gamer about to cross into married life?

19:49.433 --> 19:52.234
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully your wife to be likes games.

19:53.598 --> 19:55.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise you'll be playing a lot less games.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.841
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion is find something that she likes to do.

20:00.382 --> 20:00.742
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

20:01.282 --> 20:02.943
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife is totally jaded on games.

20:03.464 --> 20:05.945
[SPEAKER_03]: She says, yet she plays Zuma.

20:06.866 --> 20:10.748
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously think she's played the 360 more than me this week.

20:11.388 --> 20:12.189
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not kidding.

20:12.609 --> 20:14.390
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like crack to her.

20:14.550 --> 20:18.992
[SPEAKER_03]: She gets so frustrated if she can't beat certain levels.

20:19.012 --> 20:20.733
[SPEAKER_03]: She's stuck on level 6 right now.

20:21.334 --> 20:21.734
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just

20:22.757 --> 20:26.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, she'll be sitting there for hours and I'm just like, can I play Saints Row?

20:26.743 --> 20:28.165
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, Blaine Zuma!

20:28.726 --> 20:34.434
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so you know, El Mullet, we have the stripper coming soon for the chatroom bachelor party.

20:35.215 --> 20:37.098
[SPEAKER_01]: DMN, go ahead and start taking it off.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.201
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.

20:40.126 --> 20:41.487
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news, for real.

20:41.567 --> 20:46.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so anyways, this week was a whole bunch of Wii news rumors, etc.

20:47.731 --> 20:55.596
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, a lot of them were kind of based around GameStop, and especially since GameStop had their wonderful annual sales conference in Dallas.

20:56.577 --> 21:03.461
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of information leaking out of there, and of course, lots of second-hand accounts and stuff, so we don't know how much of this is true, but

21:04.039 --> 21:05.220
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pouring it to you anyways.

21:05.620 --> 21:15.446
[SPEAKER_03]: One big thing though coming out of it was that GameStop said at the show that they'd be the only retail at launch to have Wii demonstration units available in their stores.

21:16.066 --> 21:19.748
[SPEAKER_03]: And so basically you can go test out the game systems as well.

21:20.628 --> 21:23.930
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's entirely true, but maybe at launch, yeah.

21:24.511 --> 21:26.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they might be a little bit later to get them in other stores, but

21:28.702 --> 21:34.387
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I was thinking about with this whole thing with GameStop having the exclusive Wii?

21:34.447 --> 21:40.232
[SPEAKER_01]: This actually may have some truth in my mind, whereas I think some of the other rumors we're going to get to are a bunch of poopy.

21:41.072 --> 21:54.744
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the interesting thing about this, remember when you came on and you did your episode 198 report, the big one that was really controversial where you had all these things, you were talking about all this upcoming news, and one of the things you said is that there's not going to be any demo kiosks for the Wii.

21:54.764 --> 21:57.166
[SPEAKER_01]: They told us that they're not doing demo kiosks for the Wii.

21:57.466 --> 21:59.067
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the other thing, too.

21:59.087 --> 22:02.449
[SPEAKER_01]: Our sales rep or whatever from Nintendo deals with only a certain region.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.210
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, say, the West Coast or whatever.

22:25.757 --> 22:30.821
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't deal with GameStop, which would be the Dallas area.

22:31.322 --> 22:37.687
[SPEAKER_03]: So where his information might be that there are no kiosks, someone else that works for Nintendo

22:38.337 --> 22:41.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there are kiosks because they're going to GameStop.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.280
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of interesting.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.401
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.

22:43.421 --> 22:49.526
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think about that and I think about trying to put all that together because I don't think the reps that were talking to you were full of BS.

22:49.606 --> 22:53.069
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're not full of BS despite what other people on the internet might think.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.072
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of adds up for me that this could be true.

22:57.472 --> 23:09.009
[SPEAKER_03]: and the thing I think the thing the major difficulty with having a GameStop you know kiosk or not a GameStop kiosk but a Wii kiosk is that the controllers don't have a wired version there's no

23:09.969 --> 23:10.429
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:30.439 --> 23:32.941
[SPEAKER_03]: The other news that came out actually... I want to ask real quick, though.

23:32.981 --> 23:41.027
[SPEAKER_01]: What about... Now, the thing that makes me think this may not be true is that there was this story earlier about Walmart said that they weren't going to be doing it or whatever.

23:41.047 --> 23:45.410
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, well, when was Walmart given an option if it's exclusive to GameStop, right?

23:45.811 --> 23:46.031
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

23:46.792 --> 23:47.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

23:47.332 --> 23:48.073
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

23:48.153 --> 23:48.453
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

23:48.513 --> 23:49.574
[SPEAKER_01]: So take it with a grain of salt.

23:49.654 --> 23:51.315
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, okay, well, let me put it this way.

23:51.475 --> 23:54.697
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they weren't the only ones that were going to be exclusive.

23:54.837 --> 23:58.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was going to be GameStop and Walmart and maybe a few other retailers.

23:58.580 --> 24:03.523
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the retailers said, hey, we don't want this demo unit because we're afraid that people are going to get hurt.

24:03.723 --> 24:10.748
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, you know, after seeing some of these people try to navigate the self-checkout, yeah, they will get hurt because they're too dumb to figure it out.

24:11.208 --> 24:15.711
[SPEAKER_01]: JeremyTodd1 says in our chat room, they could just tie a wire where the wrist strap goes.

24:15.751 --> 24:16.672
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't be that hard at all.

24:17.509 --> 24:19.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a perfectly good option.

24:20.011 --> 24:24.195
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I could just take my X-Acto knife out of my pocket and cut the wrist strap.

24:25.616 --> 24:30.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's not going to be... Steel cable does not exactly cut with... Oh, I see.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.481
[SPEAKER_01]: Take out the wrist.

24:31.721 --> 24:32.121
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

24:32.161 --> 24:33.382
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking this whole other thing.

24:33.442 --> 24:33.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

24:34.223 --> 24:42.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't know if that would work either because wrist straps, you know, those little things on them, the string's pretty thin, so I don't know if you'd be able to stick steel cable through.

24:42.310 --> 24:42.590
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, whatever.

24:42.630 --> 24:44.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's just say you were able to stick steel cable on there.

24:45.052 --> 24:46.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Still people are going to throw them at people.

24:47.313 --> 24:50.653
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just see what freaking happens when it happens.

24:50.813 --> 24:51.713
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a month away.

24:51.814 --> 24:56.775
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because they don't have a kiosk set up, they can set up a kiosk type set up anyways.

24:57.175 --> 25:01.816
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who's to say someone can't just bust one of these things open and just create their own.

25:02.836 --> 25:03.596
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be out there.

25:04.696 --> 25:05.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

25:05.537 --> 25:11.898
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, there's some other news also that GameStop was going to be the first to be or they're going to be selling the Zune in stores so if you have a

25:13.328 --> 25:17.050
[SPEAKER_03]: A Fascination with the Microsoft Music Player Well, there you go.

25:17.070 --> 25:17.891
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy it from them.

25:18.471 --> 25:28.337
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting, though, because the other mention on this one article was that this is kind of the first time that they've done this, but if I remember correctly, they were actually selling Creative Nomads in their store as well.

25:28.377 --> 25:31.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not iPods, but they have been selling music playing devices.

25:33.540 --> 25:42.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, some of the more unbelievable rumors from the whole GameStop thing, one of them being that the GameStop Wii Kiosk is going to require

25:43.365 --> 25:45.266
[SPEAKER_03]: A credit card to be able to be used.

25:45.946 --> 26:00.352
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I imagine if they're, you know, with this kind of logic here, probably giving them your license or credit card so you don't walk out with the Wii controller, you know, maybe so that, you know, they don't have to, like, strap them down.

26:01.272 --> 26:07.815
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, when I first read this story, I imagined in my mind, like, having to slide your credit card through the Wii demo thing, and I'm like, no way!

26:07.875 --> 26:11.837
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never do that, because they might charge me for something, you know?

26:12.337 --> 26:12.477
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

26:13.289 --> 26:14.010
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

26:41.457 --> 26:44.079
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do think overall it's probably a BS story.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.321
[SPEAKER_01]: JeremyTodd1 in chat brings up a good point.

26:46.361 --> 26:47.142
[SPEAKER_01]: This can't be true!

26:47.642 --> 26:52.647
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's trying to market to everybody here, so why would they make the kiosk only available to older people who have a credit card?

26:52.667 --> 26:53.367
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good point.

26:53.387 --> 26:54.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Or driver's license, yeah.

26:54.729 --> 26:55.049
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

26:55.870 --> 26:56.130
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

26:56.450 --> 26:57.111
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

26:57.731 --> 27:02.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Another story, though, coming out of the whole GameStop conference thing.

27:04.177 --> 27:05.158
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that

27:05.891 --> 27:13.476
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop store will receive an average of six systems, more for the higher volume stores and less for the dead stores.

27:13.496 --> 27:18.000
[SPEAKER_03]: One of two systems can be given to employees at their store manager's discretion.

27:29.011 --> 27:32.112
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so, but that doesn't sound right at all.

27:32.552 --> 27:34.873
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest are going to be given out to store regulars.

27:34.953 --> 27:43.917
[SPEAKER_03]: If a manager feels that he has a customer who is very loyal, shops there often, reserves many things, they may call them and ask them if they want to guarantee one of the remaining four consoles.

27:44.257 --> 27:47.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently all four of the remaining consoles are handed out in this fashion.

27:49.719 --> 27:52.800
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't even sound right at all.

27:54.781 --> 27:55.181
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I...

27:56.559 --> 27:58.880
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every GameStop will get the same amount of PS3s, I don't think.

27:58.900 --> 27:59.840
[SPEAKER_01]: It would depend on volume.

27:59.880 --> 28:04.023
[SPEAKER_01]: So that whole, you know, you get four or whatever, no, I don't buy it.

28:04.063 --> 28:05.543
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a crap policy, too.

28:05.563 --> 28:07.565
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be so much scandal that goes along with that.

28:07.585 --> 28:08.565
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going to give... No way.

28:08.885 --> 28:11.907
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, they're not going to give them to employees at all.

28:12.167 --> 28:16.409
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they're going to get four or six, you know, they're not going to do it.

28:16.850 --> 28:21.292
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that kind of goes with other stories that we've had about the reservations.

28:21.572 --> 28:21.712
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

28:22.473 --> 28:23.953
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say real quick, by the way, we had a...

28:25.439 --> 28:32.721
[SPEAKER_01]: issue in our chat room if you're listening live on Sunday where apparently some folks were not able to get in because somehow the limit got set on the chat room.

28:32.741 --> 28:33.641
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been removed.

28:34.001 --> 28:34.641
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took it off.

28:34.661 --> 28:37.542
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've been trying to join chat and weren't having any luck, try again.

28:37.562 --> 28:39.042
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to get in now.

28:39.382 --> 28:40.623
[SPEAKER_01]: It means our chat room is that full, though.

28:41.903 --> 28:42.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

28:42.643 --> 28:42.983
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

28:43.603 --> 28:46.404
[SPEAKER_01]: So no PS3 pre-orders from regulars, huh?

28:47.184 --> 28:47.364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

28:47.544 --> 28:47.784
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

28:47.824 --> 28:50.165
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there might not be any pre-orders from anyone at all.

28:51.357 --> 29:01.305
[SPEAKER_01]: OneUp is speculating this week that at the annual GameStop conference held last Saturday in Dallas, quote, the great thing is there is a lot of demand, said Steve Morgan, president of GameStop, but launch is one day.

29:01.706 --> 29:04.308
[SPEAKER_01]: And really the key to this business is what flows after the launch.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.749
[SPEAKER_01]: We did learn a lesson last year.

29:06.069 --> 29:08.992
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the lesson is caution and optimism at the same time.

29:10.415 --> 29:18.780
[SPEAKER_01]: GameStop's decision not to guarantee your hardware pre-order is by no means carved in stone, but from this point, it seems a pretty sure thing from a strictly business point of view.

29:19.180 --> 29:24.964
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, GameStop caught some heat after it mistakenly took in more Xbox 360 pre-orders than it had the capacity to fulfill.

29:25.424 --> 29:27.245
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, that would be, you know, correct.

29:27.305 --> 29:35.030
[SPEAKER_01]: We all remember people were blaming GameStop when they couldn't get their Xbox 360s, but, you know, people were saying, well, they should have promised them, you know, yeah, it's

29:35.629 --> 29:38.991
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly they've learned their lesson, it sounds like, and they won't be doing that again anytime soon.

29:39.832 --> 29:44.134
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing I heard was that that's not exactly true either.

29:44.795 --> 29:48.717
[SPEAKER_03]: That they are going to be getting some, or they're going to be starting taking pre-orders.

29:49.257 --> 29:51.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is basically the point that they made.

29:52.239 --> 29:52.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at Hawaii.

29:53.180 --> 29:56.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawaii's been doing pre-orders for the PlayStation 3 and Wii right now.

29:57.082 --> 29:58.343
[SPEAKER_03]: They're testing that thing out.

29:58.643 --> 30:01.325
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, they are taking pre-orders on it, but...

30:02.099 --> 30:04.060
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop employees have been told to shut their mouths.

30:23.438 --> 30:28.682
[SPEAKER_01]: Quote, I'm a manager at an EB GameStop location and recently we received this great little scare notice to pass around the store.

30:29.042 --> 30:36.687
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's been sent in response to all the news about the PS3 Wii pre-orders as well as to scare employees off from buying PS3s and selling them online.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.669
[SPEAKER_01]: So, interesting.

30:38.869 --> 30:43.652
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this interesting little cease and desist and you can read the whole thing if you go over to Kotaku and you can click and find the whole thing.

30:44.373 --> 30:51.658
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's basically your typical, you know, we'd like to issue a friendly reminder about the company policy, blah, blah, blah type thing.

30:52.038 --> 30:52.158
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

30:52.594 --> 30:58.196
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, yeah, stop coming on the internet and blabbing everything because, man, people can't keep their mouth shut when it comes to some of these rumors.

31:00.136 --> 31:00.817
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of funny.

31:01.177 --> 31:06.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of these people that can't keep their mouth shut about rumors or release dates and stuff would be me.

31:06.639 --> 31:13.961
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, there's lots of good stuff, well, not a whole lot of good stuff, but still some pretty good stuff coming out this week on all the systems.

31:14.581 --> 31:19.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off with the DS, and Rob, apparently I was wrong earlier, Clubhouse Games is coming out this week on the DS.

31:19.943 --> 31:20.483
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

31:20.936 --> 31:22.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Crash Boom Bang Xbox GameCube Xbox GameCube

31:50.684 --> 31:52.746
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the portable systems as well.

31:53.667 --> 31:54.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be pretty cool.

31:55.309 --> 32:00.153
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a fan of the Family Feud, that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance.

32:00.193 --> 32:02.235
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst game I played at E3, I'm sorry to say.

32:02.516 --> 32:04.277
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get me wrong, I love the Feud.

32:04.758 --> 32:10.984
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Richard Dawson days where you make out with all the women on the show, but something is just

32:12.068 --> 32:17.972
[SPEAKER_01]: Not right in the past 20 years now with Family Feud, so... Mortal Kombat Armageddon, also coming out this week.

32:18.092 --> 32:19.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's this week.

32:20.073 --> 32:20.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

32:20.814 --> 32:31.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not so much on the Xbox this week, because, I mean, the date we have in our system right now, somehow Midway moved their date just on the Xbox version, so don't be surprised if you don't see it in stores this week.

32:32.301 --> 32:38.745
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it is slated, though, for this week, though, for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, so... But, whatever.

32:39.065 --> 32:39.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um...

32:40.823 --> 32:50.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, you've got Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox as well as PSP.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.811
[SPEAKER_03]: For the PC, you're getting a few things.

32:53.051 --> 33:00.636
[SPEAKER_03]: Warhammer 4000, Dawn of War, Dark Crusade, Devil May Cry 3, Dante's Awakening Special Edition on the PC.

33:01.196 --> 33:08.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf 07, and Dirt, Origin of Species.

33:09.922 --> 33:10.202
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

33:10.549 --> 33:12.090
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be pretty good.

33:12.430 --> 33:14.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week's going to be lots of good stuff, including Bully.

33:15.591 --> 33:16.051
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

33:16.151 --> 33:17.451
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be getting that, I'm sure?

33:18.252 --> 33:19.532
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be getting it one way or another.

33:19.672 --> 33:19.992
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

33:21.113 --> 33:21.593
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

33:22.253 --> 33:25.954
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week in Japan, I've got Japanese release dates for you, or I should say this week in Japan.

33:26.414 --> 33:28.875
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole lot of pickings for you guys in Japan this week.

33:28.915 --> 33:29.816
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a slow week.

33:30.396 --> 33:36.498
[SPEAKER_01]: MotoGP 2006 is on its way, along with Rockstar Table Tennis making its way in Japan this week.

33:36.857 --> 33:37.637
[SPEAKER_03]: I also forgot one.

33:38.578 --> 33:39.038
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2.

33:39.538 --> 33:40.538
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is awesome.

33:41.139 --> 33:42.659
[SPEAKER_03]: God Hand is coming out this week.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely worth checking out.

33:45.180 --> 33:47.601
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll actually have a review for that next week.

33:47.981 --> 33:51.163
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the games I have on my slate to play.

33:51.983 --> 33:57.045
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's not here tonight, so sorry to our European listeners, but we're just going to not do your dates tonight.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.561
[SPEAKER_01]: PowerStone Collection on the PSP

34:25.000 --> 34:26.462
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the same magic as the Dreamcast.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.182
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't explain it.

34:27.302 --> 34:28.303
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not the same magic.

34:28.363 --> 34:31.607
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, if you're a Power Stone fan, you might get a kick out of this.

34:32.167 --> 34:41.296
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Resident Evil 4 Platinum Edition making its way to the PlayStation 2 along with Wild Arms 4, Steam Bot Chronicles also on the PlayStation 2 this week.

34:41.496 --> 34:47.603
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a Game Boy Advance player, Rebel Star Tactical Command coming out for the GBA this week in Europe.

34:47.903 --> 34:48.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun.

34:48.784 --> 34:48.964
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

34:50.382 --> 35:00.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interesting information, which is not, well, I shouldn't say it's too surprising, but Miyamoto's actually come out to say that the Wii is, well, the hardware is basically a GameCube.

35:00.634 --> 35:04.558
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's kind of like saying a Pentium 4 is basically a Pentium 1.

35:05.559 --> 35:08.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, that it's on the same kind of...

35:09.502 --> 35:10.803
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:30.165 --> 35:35.306
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, now the anti-Nintendo fan base, though, is like, you know, oh, you're paying $250 for a controller.

35:35.366 --> 35:36.386
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun, suckers.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.307
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people are also saying about, you know, Super Smash Bros.

35:39.347 --> 35:41.387
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw a post in the LiveJournal community this afternoon.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.627
[SPEAKER_01]: It was talking about, you know, Smash Bros.

35:43.448 --> 35:50.869
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming out on the Wii is not really going to be using the Wii functionality in the main game, which is not much of a surprise.

35:50.929 --> 35:52.929
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I kind of wouldn't want it to.

35:53.329 --> 35:55.770
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing, why don't they just do it on the GameCube then?

35:56.130 --> 36:07.775
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just because it's... Well, the specs are still upgraded, just because... It's just like saying, you know, a PC nowadays, you know, which is still based on the same architecture as a PC from, like, say, 15 years ago.

36:08.395 --> 36:14.318
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, they're not the same thing, but they're based off the same architecture, so... So?

36:14.718 --> 36:15.378
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, big deal.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I say, play the games.

36:17.319 --> 36:18.860
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like the games, great.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.180
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares about specs?

36:20.300 --> 36:24.082
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I don't give a shit of how many USB ports are on this thing.

36:24.102 --> 36:24.402
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

36:25.217 --> 36:25.877
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not matter.

36:25.997 --> 36:28.318
[SPEAKER_03]: So just play the games if you like them, great.

36:28.638 --> 36:34.321
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, after all, Pac-Man wasn't really pushing the graphics or anything, so whatever.

36:36.702 --> 36:37.022
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

36:37.062 --> 36:40.923
[SPEAKER_01]: Bandit in our chatroom says, Miyamoto said it himself that the Wii is a souped up GameCube.

36:40.983 --> 36:43.244
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly a quote a lot of people have been running with this week.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.765
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that posted on a lot of blogs.

36:45.585 --> 36:46.646
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.987
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Sony said that the PlayStation 3 is future-proof.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.568
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll cure cancer, so I mean...

36:53.686 --> 36:56.471
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe that either, but whatever

37:06.023 --> 37:15.452
[SPEAKER_01]: According to UBS, 2 million Wii consoles were completed in the third quarter, July to September, to support the upcoming fourth quarter launch.

37:16.072 --> 37:22.458
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, at least 7 million and potentially as high as 9 million more units are in the build plan for the fourth quarter of 2006.

37:23.299 --> 37:29.064
[SPEAKER_01]: This production ramp handily exceeds a publicly announced target for 6 million units to ship by year end.

37:29.494 --> 37:33.837
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nintendo may have been playing it conservative a little bit with their launch numbers, and they may have more.

37:34.918 --> 37:41.963
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think if you want to get this on launch day, you probably are going to be having to do the pre-order or the campout or one of those things.

37:42.003 --> 37:46.086
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you're going to be able to walk into the store and pick one up if you didn't do some type of pre-planning.

37:46.126 --> 37:59.035
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's great that they're going to have that many units, but this thing's on all the Christmas lists, all the different retailers' Christmas lists, and once they launch their marketing campaign for this, it's going to be the hot Christmas item, so yeah.

37:59.448 --> 38:00.249
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38:27.649 --> 38:29.010
[SPEAKER_01]: But how important is launch day?

38:29.030 --> 38:38.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I go back and I think about PlayStation 2 and I think about... I remember seeing the lines on TV and stuff, but I don't remember being so excited about a PlayStation 2 right on launch day.

38:39.374 --> 38:40.514
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is the line?

38:40.534 --> 38:44.055
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet the PlayStation 2 was still the most successful of the last gen.

38:44.075 --> 38:44.736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the bragging.

38:44.976 --> 38:46.176
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the e-penis thing.

38:46.256 --> 38:49.217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, I've got the console and you don't.

38:49.778 --> 38:50.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm playing it first.

38:51.318 --> 38:53.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's got to be first, so...

38:54.560 --> 38:54.900
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.162
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's important is how many units they can sell by the end of the year.

38:58.342 --> 39:05.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think if they're... I mean, right now in the US, I believe they're up to about 3 million Xbox 360 units.

39:05.467 --> 39:08.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't count on me on that, but I think that's about where they're at.

39:08.969 --> 39:11.370
[SPEAKER_03]: I think worldwide they're about 6 million.

39:12.090 --> 39:22.397
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they can sell 4 million Wii units in the United States alone, and if they're able to... I'm sure they're going to be able to sell all 9 million units of the Wii.

39:22.497 --> 39:22.917
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to...

39:23.818 --> 39:24.418
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

39:50.754 --> 39:51.735
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:07.185 --> 40:07.725
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll see.

40:08.646 --> 40:13.329
[SPEAKER_01]: Bandit in our chatroom says, Best Buy better not say, oh, you can buy a Wii from us, but only as a package deal.

40:13.589 --> 40:13.990
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.

40:14.350 --> 40:14.670
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.

40:15.751 --> 40:16.431
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you they will.

40:16.611 --> 40:19.653
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will not buy it at Best Buy.

40:19.793 --> 40:22.015
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to tell you why they're going to do that, though.

40:22.135 --> 40:25.177
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why they're going to do that is because there's no margins on this thing.

40:25.537 --> 40:35.764
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing I mentioned a couple episodes ago, is that the margins on the Wii system is only a few bucks, and they have to sell it in a bundle to make money off this thing.

40:36.084 --> 40:36.645
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

40:54.653 --> 40:57.113
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever and buy it just by itself.

40:57.273 --> 41:02.094
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of these companies are going to want to try to do this and you just don't have to buy from them.

41:02.294 --> 41:05.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're really desperate to get the system at launch, then yeah, you will buy that.

41:06.195 --> 41:07.595
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

41:07.715 --> 41:13.076
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's saying anything for sure, but don't be surprised if they do because they've done it in the past with other systems.

41:13.896 --> 41:17.917
[SPEAKER_01]: Anush in our chatroom says, Sky, do you know of any major stores that are doing a midnight release?

41:18.577 --> 41:20.278
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine most will probably have to.

41:22.970 --> 41:24.491
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did ones for Xbox 360?

41:24.531 --> 41:25.792
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably who's going to do them for Wii.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.914
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can just kind of go down that list right there.

41:29.175 --> 41:31.476
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever did them for Xbox 360 is probably going to do them for Wii.

41:31.817 --> 41:36.480
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of GameStops do them for Madden, and those are just games, not even systems.

41:36.840 --> 41:44.085
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would imagine if there's a big GameStop in your area, or EB, any of those types, they will probably be doing a big midnight party.

41:45.707 --> 41:48.268
[SPEAKER_01]: God, does that mean we have to go out and report on a midnight launch?

41:48.989 --> 41:49.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck no.

41:49.710 --> 41:50.250
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do?

41:50.855 --> 41:52.196
[SPEAKER_03]: What have I got to go out there, dude?

41:52.296 --> 41:53.176
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting mine early.

41:54.157 --> 41:56.478
[SPEAKER_01]: For the goodness of better journalism.

41:57.359 --> 41:57.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

41:58.479 --> 42:04.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, I don't want to be like the news crew, because you know every fucking year they always have some stupid station.

42:04.663 --> 42:08.445
[SPEAKER_02]: Look it, there's people outside waiting in the cold for their new game system.

42:08.465 --> 42:09.566
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this new game system?

42:09.826 --> 42:10.366
[SPEAKER_02]: The why?

42:10.466 --> 42:11.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is this?

42:11.127 --> 42:13.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Why must you have the Nintendo Y?

42:13.868 --> 42:14.328
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Wii.

42:14.589 --> 42:15.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

42:15.209 --> 42:18.271
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it called... It's Wii.

42:18.371 --> 42:18.691
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

42:18.711 --> 42:18.771
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

42:20.485 --> 42:29.170
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I may have actually already committed this program to be working with other podcasters in some type of a wee news live on launch night.

42:31.471 --> 42:31.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

42:31.751 --> 42:33.772
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, there's a staff meeting after the show.

42:34.593 --> 42:35.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to go, Rob.

42:37.094 --> 42:37.494
[SPEAKER_03]: Loser.

42:39.250 --> 42:44.211
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the games you might be expecting, I'm not sure if at launch, Bionicle Heroes is going to be heading to the Wii.

42:44.712 --> 42:46.512
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bionicle Heroes is going to be pretty good.

42:46.792 --> 42:53.754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually done by Traveler's Tale, which I believe is the people behind LEGO Star Wars and the LEGO Star Wars original trilogy games.

42:53.874 --> 42:59.556
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, you would imagine, okay, a LEGO's game, Bionicle Heroes, yeah, makes perfect sense.

43:00.336 --> 43:07.098
[SPEAKER_03]: This, of course, information coming from the ESRB website, which seems to be leaking a lot of info on...

43:08.058 --> 43:09.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Upcoming games for the Wii.

43:10.740 --> 43:11.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for that soon.

43:13.942 --> 43:14.263
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

43:15.443 --> 43:15.764
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

43:15.984 --> 43:16.704
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be looking for that.

43:17.305 --> 43:17.805
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

43:17.885 --> 43:24.430
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were bitching about the Wii not having a wired internet port in it.

43:24.750 --> 43:29.033
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, of course it supports the wireless internet, but what if your house isn't wired for wireless?

43:30.374 --> 43:31.575
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're screwed, right?

43:31.595 --> 43:31.695
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

43:32.262 --> 43:33.403
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not necessarily.

43:33.764 --> 43:34.324
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.

43:34.564 --> 43:35.185
[SPEAKER_01]: The dongle.

43:35.405 --> 43:37.787
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the dongle that you got for the Nintendo DS?

43:37.807 --> 43:38.688
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use that on your Wii.

43:39.769 --> 43:42.752
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was something I'd speculated a while back that you could probably do, so that's pretty cool.

43:43.393 --> 43:44.454
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something you can do.

43:45.234 --> 43:53.883
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Nintendo has announced they are going to provide an Ethernet kit so that you can directly connect the console to a standard Internet router.

43:53.983 --> 43:56.325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to go from USB to Ethernet.

43:56.565 --> 43:57.326
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, so...

43:58.357 --> 44:02.074
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, Nintendo, in squelching that little cry of...

44:02.842 --> 44:04.884
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine those would be too expensive.

44:05.464 --> 44:07.005
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how much was the other dongle?

44:07.025 --> 44:07.005
$30?

44:07.606 --> 44:10.068
[SPEAKER_03]: $35?

44:07.706 --> 44:10.068
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $25 or something.

44:10.208 --> 44:11.169
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be honest, though.

44:11.189 --> 44:17.294
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be spending that kind of money to get your Wii online, you might want to think about just upgrading to a wireless router for your house.

44:17.354 --> 44:18.955
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not that expensive these days.

44:18.975 --> 44:28.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a wireless router, and if you really don't want to spend the money, just spend $25 on the wireless thing, because then that way you can use the Wi-Fi with your DS as well.

44:29.484 --> 44:31.125
[SPEAKER_01]: And with your PSP, I think, so...

44:31.724 --> 44:31.984
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

44:32.385 --> 44:33.686
[SPEAKER_01]: El Mullet brings up a good point.

44:33.986 --> 44:35.747
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the dongle on your Wii.

44:35.827 --> 44:36.848
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't that sound right?

44:38.669 --> 44:39.050
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

44:39.090 --> 44:39.430
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.

44:40.170 --> 44:41.091
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds dirty.

44:41.972 --> 44:44.213
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wonder what's kind of interesting about that.

44:44.394 --> 44:47.936
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you could use... No, no, you wouldn't be able to use that.

44:47.956 --> 44:54.321
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say use the Xbox 360 one, but that's $99, and that plugs in the Ethernet port anyways.

44:54.781 --> 44:55.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry, I digress.

44:56.563 --> 44:56.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

44:57.620 --> 45:01.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's been a lot of, you know, in the past, people cheating in MMOs.

45:01.883 --> 45:10.089
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, basically hiring people to, you know, farm gold for them or to, you know, sell accounts to them that are high level and stuff like that.

45:10.449 --> 45:15.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now they're kind of doing something like that on the Xbox 360 with someone's Gamertag.

45:15.473 --> 45:15.873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

45:16.013 --> 45:22.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone actually has their Gamertag and their Xbox 360 hard drive up on eBay for sale.

45:23.258 --> 45:24.880
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gamertag Rants 6 is...

45:26.060 --> 45:50.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Who has, by the looks of it, over 30,000 points on their gamer score From what I understand, this is actually the number one ranked gamer score on my gamer card net I guess so The guy's got 19 bids as of right now As of when Xbox 360 updates reported it They've actually, and the bidding's up to $5,000 already

45:53.067 --> 45:54.388
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why the guy's selling it?

45:54.528 --> 45:56.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's buying a PS3.

45:59.233 --> 46:00.053
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.

46:00.814 --> 46:03.096
[SPEAKER_01]: But why would you buy this just to have the gamer score?

46:03.416 --> 46:09.602
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this kind of goes along with another story that didn't make our show roll for tonight, but surely a lot of you guys have heard about this.

46:09.622 --> 46:18.270
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that company out there that's offering to inflate your gamer score or earn you 3,000 gamer score points for, what was it, 3,000 points for 200 bucks, something like that?

46:19.304 --> 46:19.624
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

46:20.004 --> 46:20.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you do that?

46:21.125 --> 46:25.348
[SPEAKER_03]: For about 10 bucks you can do the same thing and even more than that.

46:25.848 --> 46:27.749
[SPEAKER_03]: And why you would even want to spend this kind of money?

46:28.150 --> 46:30.151
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean for 10 bucks you can do the same thing?

46:30.551 --> 46:32.472
[SPEAKER_03]: There's ways you can inflate your gamer score.

46:32.652 --> 46:33.173
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cheat.

46:34.053 --> 46:34.274
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

46:34.774 --> 46:35.014
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

46:35.294 --> 46:35.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Saves.

46:36.255 --> 46:36.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Game saves.

46:36.755 --> 46:37.636
[SPEAKER_03]: Transferring game saves.

46:37.936 --> 46:40.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain game saves on games will actually unlock achievement points for you.

46:41.118 --> 46:42.259
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotcha.

46:42.379 --> 46:42.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

46:43.159 --> 46:46.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can actually hack saves to do that as well.

46:47.382 --> 46:47.542
[SPEAKER_03]: But

46:48.446 --> 46:50.348
[SPEAKER_03]: So why you would spend $300 on this?

46:51.809 --> 46:56.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you even give away your personal account to some stranger?

46:56.893 --> 46:57.533
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beyond me.

46:57.773 --> 46:58.114
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

46:58.174 --> 46:59.595
[SPEAKER_03]: But I bet you anything this is what they're doing.

46:59.615 --> 47:02.137
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just $300 for like 10 minutes of work.

47:04.419 --> 47:05.720
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whoops, that story wasn't in the show.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.421
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the next thing I was supposed to go over?

47:07.521 --> 47:09.102
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, excellent.

47:09.122 --> 47:10.303
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about it now.

47:10.803 --> 47:13.345
[SPEAKER_01]: We prepped really hard for tonight's show, ladies and gentlemen.

47:14.286 --> 47:15.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

47:15.047 --> 47:15.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

47:16.371 --> 47:19.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's pretty awesome that you mentioned that.

47:19.133 --> 47:21.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so let's just keep it moving.

47:21.514 --> 47:33.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, now, you know, I'm glad that there's people out there actually, you know, concentrating on Xbox Live because, you know, it just wasn't really that annoying yet.

47:33.762 --> 47:38.725
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now there's a brand new device out there for smack talking called Smack Talk.

47:39.105 --> 47:39.225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $29.99.

47:40.913 --> 47:47.476
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a little device that plugs into your headphone port on your Xbox 360 controller.

47:48.316 --> 47:53.758
[SPEAKER_03]: And it allows you to record five different smack talks into the device.

47:54.198 --> 47:59.901
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can push the button at any time to release an automated blah, blah, blah.

48:00.701 --> 48:01.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I pwned you, noob.

48:01.941 --> 48:02.822
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, stuff like that.

48:02.842 --> 48:02.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

48:04.909 --> 48:05.409
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray.

48:06.090 --> 48:06.690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's excellent.

48:06.710 --> 48:14.676
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what most people do is like, you know, take South Park recordings from that World of Warcraft episode, you know, total pwnage, and then put it on the stupid thing.

48:14.996 --> 48:15.797
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it comes through.

48:15.837 --> 48:20.260
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because, you know, it's all... You know what's going to be on mine when I get one of these.

48:21.461 --> 48:22.541
[SPEAKER_01]: Draw four, bitch!

48:24.143 --> 48:25.163
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding, I'm not getting one.

48:27.116 --> 48:31.318
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to point out some of the chat in our chat room about the whole inflating your gamer score thing.

48:31.918 --> 48:32.918
[SPEAKER_01]: Elmolet has a method.

48:33.178 --> 48:34.399
[SPEAKER_01]: One, sign up with Gamefly.

48:34.459 --> 48:35.959
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, rent four games at a time.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.480
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, play the games.

48:37.780 --> 48:38.821
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, earn mad points.

48:39.401 --> 48:41.281
[SPEAKER_01]: And VXJasonXV agrees with that.

48:41.341 --> 48:42.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Just freaking play.

48:43.382 --> 48:43.742
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

48:44.303 --> 48:48.084
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jeremy Todd 1 wants to ask, Loki, if you could sell your account for $5,000, would you?

48:48.944 --> 48:50.805
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, because I just started a new one.

48:52.406 --> 48:52.946
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?

48:53.553 --> 48:57.176
[SPEAKER_01]: Elmullet would like to share he's almost at 10,000 points through the Gamefly renting method.

48:57.576 --> 48:59.218
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he does have the highest score on my friends list.

48:59.338 --> 49:01.260
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't have time to play that many games.

49:01.980 --> 49:05.904
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have that many games, too, to play, but I just don't have the time.

49:07.425 --> 49:12.249
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ wants to know, what are the five pre-programmed things in the Smack Talk device?

49:12.349 --> 49:17.774
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, fag, fuck, bitch, owned, retard are the five that will be pre-programmed.

49:17.794 --> 49:18.654
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

49:18.674 --> 49:19.275
[SPEAKER_01]: He said fag.

49:19.635 --> 49:20.256
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

49:21.437 --> 49:21.757
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

49:24.821 --> 49:25.841
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, people, why?

49:27.402 --> 49:31.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of these games you may or may not be smack talking on is NBA Live 07.

49:32.404 --> 49:34.444
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you where the smack talk's going right now.

49:34.825 --> 49:35.405
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to EA.

49:36.630 --> 49:37.751
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.

49:55.171 --> 50:01.813
[SPEAKER_01]: users leaving Battlefield 2 because they feel the problems will never be addressed, or former FIFA players moving on to Pro Evolution winning XI.

50:02.273 --> 50:03.773
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sense that we are all sharing.

50:04.073 --> 50:09.794
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at NBA Live over the last few years and we see the same basic game being re-released with new fancy features.

50:10.615 --> 50:14.236
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's kind of funny because that's what all the non-sports games fans say about these games.

50:14.276 --> 50:18.777
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when they don't understand Madden 06, 07, they go, it's just a roster update.

50:18.917 --> 50:20.017
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of is.

50:20.057 --> 50:21.197
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the fans are admitting it.

50:21.237 --> 50:22.698
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even worse with FIFA.

50:22.778 --> 50:24.478
[SPEAKER_01]: FIFA, they release two games a year.

50:25.371 --> 50:27.974
[SPEAKER_01]: The same elemental problems from the last few years are still there.

50:28.334 --> 50:30.516
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have been tweaked, but the overall issues still exist.

50:30.816 --> 50:36.181
[SPEAKER_01]: While there are plenty of new features, it gives the impression that EA is saying in response to the lingering issues, yeah, well, hey, look at this.

50:36.641 --> 50:40.644
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it an all-star weekend, superstar moves, or dynasty additions.

50:40.905 --> 50:44.468
[SPEAKER_01]: While those additions are nice to have, it is piling on a base that cannot support it.

50:44.768 --> 50:50.253
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of addressing the underlying fractures, EA is just constructing a new structure on the old crumbling foundation.

50:50.533 --> 50:52.575
[SPEAKER_01]: And on this letter, they put YouTube links.

50:53.115 --> 50:54.916
[SPEAKER_01]: to actual videos of the game being buggy.

50:55.557 --> 51:01.780
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting rise up of the fan community against this, especially that part where they say they're all going to go play NBA 2K.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.202
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty, that them's fighting words.

51:04.222 --> 51:10.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you gotta talk in numbers because, you know, I would be very interested to see if EA responds to this.

51:11.646 --> 51:11.886
[SPEAKER_01]: At all.

51:12.727 --> 51:13.187
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

51:13.327 --> 51:21.752
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, that's, I don't know, I mean, you can probably lose these rabid fans on the internet and still make money on the game, but

51:22.805 --> 51:26.566
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to do something about this free publicity or it's going to go away.

51:27.106 --> 51:28.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

51:28.507 --> 51:30.988
[SPEAKER_03]: All EA seems to care about nowadays is money anyways.

51:31.248 --> 51:37.390
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw the stories about how they're releasing Madden tutorial videos on how to throw passes and stuff.

51:37.430 --> 51:41.391
[SPEAKER_03]: They're charging on Xbox Live Marketplace for this stuff.

51:42.071 --> 51:44.712
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically stuff that should have been included in the game in the first place.

51:45.752 --> 51:47.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're charging premium content for this.

51:48.953 --> 51:49.433
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck them.

51:49.733 --> 51:51.734
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of responses in our chat room.

51:52.250 --> 52:15.300
[SPEAKER_01]: JeremyTodd1 says, EA's response, blame Canada, not us Deekman says, EA Games is never going to lose money as long as they're publishing Maxis games Joshi16 says, EA will not acknowledge their own faults Blackwolf says, EA's response, you already bought our game, bitches Interesting Yeah, I mean

52:16.786 --> 52:17.967
[SPEAKER_03]: You bought them, so whatever.

52:18.107 --> 52:19.688
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just, you know, wait to play them.

52:20.108 --> 52:20.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait to buy them.

52:20.829 --> 52:24.692
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, wait for the reviews to come out so you can find out if it's buggy or not.

52:24.712 --> 52:28.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, this year, actually, 2K7 got a way better review than live.

52:29.055 --> 52:30.376
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll see.

52:31.016 --> 52:33.718
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, all this news about buggy games makes me angry.

52:33.758 --> 52:37.101
[SPEAKER_01]: You should release your game with minimal faults.

52:37.141 --> 52:41.364
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's going to be bugs and everything, but minimal faults and not try to patch it all on the back end.

52:41.544 --> 52:44.506
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just not playing patch it all like some companies do.

52:45.206 --> 52:45.927
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes us angry.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.097
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what that means.

52:47.297 --> 52:49.118
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for... FU of the Week.

52:49.138 --> 52:49.618
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.

52:59.461 --> 53:05.443
[SPEAKER_01]: Since Jamie's not here tonight, I will enter an FU to traffic on her behalf because that's her typical FU.

53:06.323 --> 53:08.804
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, should I be entering an FU to traffic on your behalf as well?

53:09.604 --> 53:09.704
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

53:10.129 --> 53:12.131
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I wasn't really driving that much this week.

53:12.731 --> 53:23.819
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to say FD to stupid people that are trying to use the self-checkout because it actually takes longer for them to self-checkout than it would to check out normally.

53:24.299 --> 53:35.107
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's kind of funny sometimes that they put self-checkout machines in these stores that you know people are not smart enough to actually be able to use.

53:35.147 --> 53:36.428
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Walmart, for example.

53:36.868 --> 53:38.970
[SPEAKER_03]: There should not be self-checkout at Walmart because

53:39.986 --> 53:42.667
[SPEAKER_03]: My god, these people don't understand anything other than hunting games.

53:42.807 --> 53:46.508
[SPEAKER_03]: So, please, remove the self-checkout from Walmart.

53:46.588 --> 53:48.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, like, block it off, you know, IQ test.

53:49.449 --> 53:50.890
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have a smart card, you know.

53:51.250 --> 53:52.330
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a smart person.

53:52.670 --> 53:53.951
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be able to use this device.

53:54.591 --> 53:55.071
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dumb.

53:55.651 --> 53:55.971
[SPEAKER_01]: Go away.

53:58.472 --> 54:00.413
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a much lamer FU to enter in tonight.

54:00.453 --> 54:05.654
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU would go to Beatmania 2DX, specifically doubles mode, because it's hard.

54:05.714 --> 54:06.675
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard.

54:06.735 --> 54:07.715
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I can pass...

54:08.417 --> 54:14.819
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay at the regular 7 key mode, but, well, actually I've lost a lot of skill because I haven't played a lot regularly, so F you to that.

54:15.119 --> 54:19.221
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that there's no working Beatmania 2DX arcade machine in town anymore.

54:19.481 --> 54:20.821
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really suck at doubles.

54:20.981 --> 54:24.743
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been trying to use your controller to play doubles, and I passed, like, some 4s, but that's about it.

54:25.103 --> 54:25.563
[SPEAKER_01]: I suck.

54:26.183 --> 54:32.745
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very humbling to go from being able to pass 7s and some flashing 7s to, like, shit, I can only play 4s now because I'm doing doubles.

54:33.706 --> 54:37.807
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only play 4s and some 4s, not even all of them.

54:38.849 --> 54:39.429
[SPEAKER_03]: I suck at this.

55:05.996 --> 55:12.118
[SPEAKER_03]: but NBA 2K7 will support seven players offline which is pretty interesting.

55:13.839 --> 55:15.419
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven players is kind of an odd number.

55:15.519 --> 55:18.700
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think six players would be good enough since it's three on three.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.201
[SPEAKER_01]: Do any of you have that many friends?

55:21.021 --> 55:21.741
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have that many friends.

55:21.801 --> 55:26.083
[SPEAKER_03]: I have four controllers and I never play with four friends because no one wants to play.

55:26.663 --> 55:27.283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so lonely.

55:28.323 --> 55:31.684
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come over and play but not NBA because I suck at those games.

55:31.704 --> 55:33.165
[SPEAKER_01]: Double dribble for life, man.

55:33.615 --> 55:34.135
[SPEAKER_01]: Double Dribble

55:58.139 --> 56:01.200
[SPEAKER_01]: So new peripherals are coming out for the PlayStation 3.

56:01.300 --> 56:06.381
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I can't remember if we mentioned it last week, but the controller's being named the Six Axis.

56:07.141 --> 56:08.402
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't we talk a little bit about that last week?

56:08.442 --> 56:10.142
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if that was last week or not.

56:10.462 --> 56:16.684
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, the controller's officially been dubbed the Six Axis, and IGN's posted some very nice little screenshots of all these devices that are coming out.

56:17.284 --> 56:18.144
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, have you been to...

56:19.033 --> 56:19.814
[SPEAKER_01]: GameStop recently.

56:19.874 --> 56:26.858
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some big banner ads for PlayStation 3 and Wii in the store, like kind of placeholding where they're going to put them up on the wall when they get those systems in.

56:27.358 --> 56:30.560
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a nice big clear picture of the PlayStation 3 controller on there.

56:30.981 --> 56:32.161
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the memory card USB.

56:32.181 --> 56:36.384
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't really need to see a big clear controller picture because I've touched it.

56:36.544 --> 56:36.784
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

56:36.804 --> 56:37.365
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.

56:37.805 --> 56:38.305
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.

56:38.505 --> 56:39.246
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see one.

56:40.011 --> 56:40.691
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the remote, though.

56:40.811 --> 56:41.772
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the remote's pretty cool.

56:41.792 --> 56:43.453
[SPEAKER_01]: The remote has like 10,000 buttons.

56:44.273 --> 56:46.534
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like one of those all-in-one style remotes.

56:46.734 --> 56:49.115
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like the Harmony remote for the 360.

56:49.155 --> 56:52.156
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still weirded out by the whole Spider-Man font on the PlayStation 3, though.

56:52.176 --> 56:55.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you like that remote that they had, the Harmony one made by Logitech?

56:55.678 --> 56:56.738
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, that remote's $150?

56:56.838 --> 56:58.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:58.219 --> 56:59.540
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing that at Best Buy or whatever.

56:59.560 --> 57:03.581
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what the... You don't need to spend $150 on a remote unless it will never get lost.

57:03.881 --> 57:05.522
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's that big, it probably won't ever get lost.

57:06.242 --> 57:07.023
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it would be worth it.

57:07.203 --> 57:07.463
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

57:07.783 --> 57:09.344
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be attached to the PS3.

57:10.225 --> 57:21.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, one thing that Sony's been combating, other than a lot of bad press, is that the PlayStation 3 is overheating and having some sort of a similar problem as the Xbox 360 did.

57:21.909 --> 57:25.951
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is basically coming from Tokyo Game Show, because a lot of the units were overheating.

57:26.211 --> 57:28.952
[SPEAKER_03]: But from what I heard about Tokyo Game Show, that place wasn't air-conditioned.

57:29.272 --> 57:30.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that fucking suck?

57:30.913 --> 57:34.994
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's hot as it is in E3, let alone without AC.

57:35.915 --> 57:37.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that, I wouldn't go.

57:37.515 --> 57:38.376
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good deterrent, though.

57:38.516 --> 57:39.496
[SPEAKER_03]: They should do that, turn off the air.

57:40.103 --> 57:43.725
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the place would smell so awful.

57:44.165 --> 57:46.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it probably does anyways.

57:47.267 --> 57:55.831
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, basically they're having overheating problems at Tokyo Game Show because, you know, the temperature of the building was just so high.

57:57.172 --> 58:06.156
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting, though, is I didn't hear about any overheating problems on the 360 or, you know, the Wii's or anything like that from Tokyo Game Show, so I don't know.

58:06.176 --> 58:06.997
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see at launch.

58:07.937 --> 58:09.078
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I don't

58:09.537 --> 58:09.857
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

58:09.977 --> 58:12.158
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I want to buy a PlayStation 3 at launch.

58:12.718 --> 58:14.439
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too much stuff to get wrong.

58:15.380 --> 58:17.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, that thing weighs about 15 pounds from what I heard.

58:19.601 --> 58:24.364
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already decided I'm not getting one at launch because there's nothing coming out at launch I'm interested in playing.

58:24.524 --> 58:25.344
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Sony fans.

58:25.364 --> 58:26.745
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how I honestly feel about it.

58:26.845 --> 58:28.405
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing I really want at launch.

58:28.425 --> 58:29.626
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the games for me, you know.

58:30.066 --> 58:33.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if they had a Twisted Metal or maybe, I don't know.

58:33.668 --> 58:35.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know, Final Fantasy XIII or something.

58:35.368 --> 58:36.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIII would be cool, but

58:37.096 --> 58:37.997
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59:07.137 --> 59:09.459
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I hope that sucks.

59:10.060 --> 59:26.835
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wouldn't be surprised if I see the news story for it, but right now I'm going to expect it to come out November 17th, and when it doesn't, I'll just be like, well, that's nothing new, but if they fucking miss this year's Christmas, that ain't good.

59:27.375 --> 59:28.516
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good at all.

59:28.536 --> 59:31.339
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have another Neo Geo on their hands.

59:32.489 --> 59:32.849
[SPEAKER_01]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7

59:53.887 --> 59:58.389
[SPEAKER_01]: NBA 2007 is in the video running at 1080p at 60 frames a second.

59:58.429 --> 01:00:04.433
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows a little bit of the PSP connectivity, some of the photo browser stuff, and the visualizer that goes with the music.

01:00:05.914 --> 01:00:11.238
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically think PlayStation Portable interface, that's the PlayStation 3 interface.

01:00:11.898 --> 01:00:12.999
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at least it's consistent.

01:00:13.579 --> 01:00:14.620
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, but I mean...

01:00:15.717 --> 01:00:22.001
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, straight down to pop the game in and you have the background change and a little animation icon video or whatever.

01:00:22.021 --> 01:00:26.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same thing, so not a huge surprise.

01:00:27.064 --> 01:00:41.872
[SPEAKER_03]: What is kind of surprising, though, is that the PSP, there's been a lot of, you know, stuff going on in the homebrew community for the PSP, including, and this is very interesting, a brand new device that someone's actually creating called the PSP Touch Me.

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:44.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, where did the PSP touch you?

01:00:45.014 --> 01:00:45.054
Ha!

01:00:46.189 --> 01:00:47.610
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me on the doll where it touched you.

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:59.818
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually going to be a device that plugs into the USB port and puts kind of a glass screen over the actual screen, and you'll be using a stylus with it as a touchscreen.

01:01:00.338 --> 01:01:04.921
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of interesting to see homebrew people come out with this stuff.

01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:11.203
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking of ideas that Sony themselves probably didn't even consider.

01:01:11.984 --> 01:01:24.851
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but even if Sony themselves came out tomorrow and said, hey, we're going to sell this touchscreen adapter for the PSP, would it... I mean, because, like you say, the stuff has to be out there for the games to be made for it.

01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:31.896
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why peripherals traditionally have not done very well, because they weren't very well supported on the game front.

01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:35.918
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would the PSP release a touchscreen officially if no...

01:01:36.641 --> 01:01:38.702
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they would anyways.

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.883
[SPEAKER_03]: They might be accused of copying.

01:01:41.963 --> 01:01:43.263
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the hell can I use this for?

01:01:43.683 --> 01:01:47.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Homebrew games, which it's only going to support some homebrew games right now.

01:01:48.325 --> 01:01:51.566
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's designed to use as an add-on and it will cost you $56.

01:01:52.986 --> 01:01:57.968
[SPEAKER_03]: And no word on when it's going to be released, but it looks pretty cool.

01:01:58.768 --> 01:01:59.049
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:03.410
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not buying one, but it's kind of neat.

01:02:04.519 --> 01:02:07.080
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's neat that the community came together and built that.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.660
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the neatest part of it for me.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just like they built a GPS device for this thing already, so... Isn't there an official one now?

01:02:13.821 --> 01:02:15.422
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an official GPS device.

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:16.482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out later this year.

01:02:16.522 --> 01:02:22.603
[SPEAKER_01]: So could that happen where Sony decides to make an official one, or would they not do that out of fear of being called Nintendo copiers?

01:02:23.523 --> 01:02:26.724
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they would... I don't think they... I think they think it's gimmicky.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:30.125
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, you know, they did do the eye toy, so... I don't know.

01:02:30.999 --> 01:02:33.340
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, look at some of the cool stuff Homebrew is doing.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:39.882
[SPEAKER_03]: They released a custom firmware this week also, a 2.71 firmware that runs Homebrew games.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:46.944
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can run your current games right now for the PSP and Homebrew without any modification.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:58.888
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing is you can't upgrade using an official upgrader that comes out later on, but you can always downgrade it back to 1.5 and then upgrade again if you really wanted to, but

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:00.094
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

01:03:00.514 --> 01:03:04.755
[SPEAKER_03]: They've broken every firmware that they come out with, so that's pretty awesome, though.

01:03:05.476 --> 01:03:05.736
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:03:07.096 --> 01:03:10.157
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to start to bring this segment to a close.

01:03:10.597 --> 01:03:12.758
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into the DDR previews first.

01:03:13.658 --> 01:03:20.960
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been premiering over the past several weeks some new tracks from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4 coming out for the Xbox very soon.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.140
[SPEAKER_01]: Later this month, right?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.040
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the last we heard.

01:03:23.561 --> 01:03:23.801
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:03:23.981 --> 01:03:24.281
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.681
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, what?

01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:26.921
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultramix 4.

01:03:27.302 --> 01:03:27.862
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no.

01:03:27.902 --> 01:03:28.402
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in...

01:03:29.377 --> 01:03:29.877
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:57.324
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm going to say this is kind of preliminary right now because I don't... This is not coming to us from official sources.

01:03:57.844 --> 01:04:01.106
[SPEAKER_01]: This news that Loki's about to give is not from an official source.

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:02.627
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from his distribution channels.

01:04:02.787 --> 01:04:03.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

01:04:04.268 --> 01:04:15.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Universe, $49.99 for the game by itself, $79.99 for the game plus a pad, which I don't understand why they would do a by-the-self version of the game seeing as there's no pad for the 360 yet, so...

01:04:17.714 --> 01:04:18.014
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:20.375
[SPEAKER_01]: But hypothetically, the pad's going to have to be USB, right?

01:04:20.415 --> 01:04:29.160
[SPEAKER_01]: It is USB, so I don't know if it supports... So does that mean if I happen to own a red octane pad that had the USB for my Stepmania, then I could use that on the 360?

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:30.720
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:31.481
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

01:04:31.561 --> 01:04:37.484
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's... Well, I mean, is it going to show into your system as two different games that there are not two different games?

01:04:38.004 --> 01:04:39.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it might not know.

01:04:39.465 --> 01:04:41.726
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on how it maps out, because...

01:04:42.284 --> 01:04:52.447
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's compatible with a PC, you know, where you can map the keys for a USB controller, but you can't just plug in a USB controller into the 360 and it'll automatically work.

01:04:53.107 --> 01:04:55.588
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whether it supports it or not.

01:04:55.888 --> 01:05:00.010
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we'll take it with a little bit of a grain of salt, but those look to be the preliminary prices for the game.

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:01.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just like Beatmania for the US.

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:06.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how we announced originally that it had two SKUs, one without the controller and one with the controller?

01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:07.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true, that's true.

01:05:08.462 --> 01:05:08.722
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR ULTRAMIX 4

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.012
[SPEAKER_01]: and our good buddy MiniHead also does songs under the name Monolithic.

01:05:33.072 --> 01:05:34.753
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I believe that was the first name he was using.

01:05:35.093 --> 01:05:38.915
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call him our good buddy because he actually does the intro to our show here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:43.096
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever wondered where that little ditty at the beginning of our program came from, that was actually written by him.

01:05:43.336 --> 01:05:50.259
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he has a song that's going to be in DDR Ultramix 4 and it's called Arms, the Alpha Omega Extended Mix.

01:05:50.299 --> 01:05:53.921
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to play it for you right now on the DDR Sneak Peeks, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:58.168 --> 01:05:58.554
Thank you.

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:32.662
Thank you for watching!

01:11:06.226 --> 01:11:13.895
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our buddy MidiHead making an original piece there under the name Monolithic with Arms, the Alpha Omega mix.

01:11:13.955 --> 01:11:15.216
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that was the long mix.

01:11:15.236 --> 01:11:17.158
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I forgot to say that before we started playing it.

01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:21.383
[SPEAKER_01]: That is coming to DDR Ultra Mix 4 a little later this year.

01:11:21.723 --> 01:11:24.306
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's go into some of the DDR cuts now.

01:11:24.386 --> 01:11:27.530
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first song is going to be from DDR Universe.

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:29.110
[SPEAKER_01]: Coibito

01:12:08.436 --> 01:12:11.117
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:12:43.932 --> 01:12:44.813
Thank you for watching.

01:12:44.853 --> 01:12:45.613
See you next time.

01:13:28.001 --> 01:13:34.244
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio bringing you that premiere there of Coibito from DDR Universe.

01:13:34.624 --> 01:13:36.545
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Togo Project featuring Sana.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:40.187
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's go into another song from DDR Ultramix 4.

01:13:40.387 --> 01:13:49.391
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by a group called Dirty Hertz, and it features Renna Jones, and the song is called Snake Charmer, and it's coming to DDR Ultramix 4 here on the Sneak Peeks.

01:14:49.241 --> 01:14:50.165
Thanks for watching!

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:29.226
[SPEAKER_01]: SnakeCharmer on Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:39.815 --> 01:15:47.602
[SPEAKER_01]: because this song was actually in the trailer for DDR Universe and we can confirm it is in the game, which you probably would have figured out.

01:15:48.142 --> 01:15:49.163
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also tell you the name of it.

01:15:49.223 --> 01:15:53.106
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Treble, Bass, and Attitude and it's by a group called The Acolyte.

01:15:53.406 --> 01:15:57.550
[SPEAKER_01]: So here it is on the DDR Sneak Peeks on DDR Universe, Treble, Bass, and Attitude.

01:17:27.008 --> 01:17:28.429
[SPEAKER_01]: from DDR Universe.

01:17:28.509 --> 01:17:31.471
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Treble Basin Attitude by The Acolyte.

01:17:32.292 --> 01:17:32.712
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

01:17:32.752 --> 01:17:33.653
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a... Hold on.

01:17:33.673 --> 01:17:37.816
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to put my glow sticks away because that was a little bit of a raving song there or something.

01:17:38.457 --> 01:17:40.378
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like folks in the chat room agree there.

01:17:40.398 --> 01:17:41.319
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking there.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.301
[SPEAKER_01]: Usyagi.

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:43.941
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

01:17:44.261 --> 01:17:45.843
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably totally mispronounced that name.

01:17:46.263 --> 01:17:50.506
[SPEAKER_01]: Usyagi says, I see myself hyped up on candy and energy drinks playing that song.

01:17:50.686 --> 01:17:51.027
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

01:17:51.447 --> 01:17:54.149
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely the mood I'm going to have to be in to play that song.

01:17:54.434 --> 01:17:55.154
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:22.023
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 minutes before we went live tonight, we were like, shit, we were going to talk about this and totally left it off the show roll.

01:18:22.103 --> 01:18:22.363
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

01:18:22.644 --> 01:18:25.205
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is some pretty big news a lot of people were talking about this week.

01:18:25.245 --> 01:18:26.506
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Loki, what's this all about?

01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:37.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's been officially announced, as we talked about a while ago when Kotaku leaked it, I guess, about the Burger King games coming to a store near you.

01:18:37.372 --> 01:18:38.613
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be three games.

01:18:39.053 --> 01:18:46.137
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one called Big Bumpin', which is going to be kind of like a Mario Kart racing game with bumper cars.

01:18:46.693 --> 01:18:59.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Pocket Bike Racer, which is also another racing game, and Sneak King, which is going to be basically kind of a stealthy game where you're supposed to be delivering burgers to hungry people.

01:19:00.282 --> 01:19:01.863
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very interesting.

01:19:01.883 --> 01:19:11.329
[SPEAKER_03]: The games are going to retail for about $3.99 each, and actually they will be working on both the 360 and the Xbox.

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:15.372
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 360 version, each one's going to have 200 achievement points.

01:19:16.006 --> 01:19:17.055
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

01:19:17.418 --> 01:19:17.962
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

01:19:18.979 --> 01:19:25.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, granted, this is like consumer whoring to the max, but... But that Sneak King game looks awesome!

01:19:25.464 --> 01:19:32.449
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't help but want to buy these, and yeah... The price is right, so what if it's corporate whore lease sponsored out?

01:19:32.489 --> 01:19:37.533
[SPEAKER_03]: If the games are fun, I guess that's what... I think this Sneak King could turn out to be a really cult classic.

01:19:37.693 --> 01:19:39.214
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know if I get the game.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:43.738
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it could just be... It could be a good concept that ends up getting horribly executed.

01:19:43.758 --> 01:19:44.258
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

01:19:44.458 --> 01:19:46.740
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole appeal of Sneak King is the fact that

01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:48.231
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:20:12.759 --> 01:20:15.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, I mean, so it's very interesting.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:21.802
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, 200 achievement points per game, so that's pretty cool if you want to whore up your achievement points.

01:20:22.502 --> 01:20:27.304
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't they release these on Xbox Live Arcade is what I don't understand.

01:20:27.624 --> 01:20:28.144
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know either.

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:32.545
[SPEAKER_01]: Bandit says, oh god, it's MC Kids all over again.

01:20:33.266 --> 01:20:37.027
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly not the first corporately sponsored game we've seen.

01:20:37.127 --> 01:20:37.847
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

01:20:38.439 --> 01:20:39.800
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.381
[SPEAKER_01]: Just before we did.

01:21:02.841 --> 01:21:07.424
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kotaku is reporting that the Wii could be launching early?

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:12.287
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the interesting thing is what they're showing are these screenshots from Best Buys.

01:21:12.987 --> 01:21:15.869
[SPEAKER_01]: Not their site, but I guess their internal computer system.

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:21.113
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've looked up the Sony PlayStation 3 in there, and sure enough it shows that November 17th is the street date.

01:21:21.513 --> 01:21:27.216
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've looked up the Wii, and the Wii shows an in-stock date of October 29th.

01:21:28.815 --> 01:21:34.239
[SPEAKER_01]: So, why would they have that in their system as coming in on October 29th if something wasn't fishy?

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.621
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, that seems a little interesting.

01:21:36.741 --> 01:21:40.905
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be getting the units early, you know, because they're going to have, you know, a lot of them.

01:21:42.666 --> 01:21:46.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting enough, though, October 29th is a Sunday, and Nintendo Lake is launching on a Sunday.

01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:48.571
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think it's full of BS.

01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:54.035
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's any way, not after all this campaign and everything, I know it's wishful thinking...

01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:54.880
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:19.841 --> 01:22:21.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be getting it fucking early, and that's awesome.

01:22:21.983 --> 01:22:22.444
[SPEAKER_01]: You hope.

01:22:22.924 --> 01:22:24.286
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope, yeah.

01:22:24.366 --> 01:22:28.190
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a few other things I wanted to mention real quick before we end this segment.

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:28.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

01:22:29.151 --> 01:22:30.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff I forgot to mention.

01:22:30.252 --> 01:22:31.994
[SPEAKER_03]: The under-the-radar type of stuff.

01:22:32.995 --> 01:22:37.280
[SPEAKER_03]: As mentioned earlier, we talked about DDR Universe, the price of it, $49.99 for the game, only $79.99 for the bundle.

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Game's supposed to be coming out December 5th.

01:22:41.843 --> 01:22:43.244
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the date as it is right now.

01:22:43.264 --> 01:22:47.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, dates keep moving around for November and December, so I wouldn't be surprised if it moves.

01:22:48.247 --> 01:22:55.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interesting stuff, though, talking about the PlayStation 3 launch games, and I think we might have a story later on that kind of covers some of this, too.

01:22:56.211 --> 01:23:00.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Koei, their games are actually delayed now because their dev units got to them late.

01:23:01.554 --> 01:23:05.997
[SPEAKER_03]: Both Fatal Inertia and Bladestorm are going to be coming out now February 16th.

01:23:07.479 --> 01:23:10.301
[SPEAKER_03]: and Super Swing Golf or Super Swing Golf Penga, I believe it's called in Japan.

01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:52.283
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be also coming out on the 13th and we mentioned earlier I think on an earlier podcast about the Activision Wii games being $59.99 well finally someone tuned them in to the fact that no games for the Wii are $59.99 so they've dropped them all down to $49.99 which is excellent

01:23:54.366 --> 01:24:00.127
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking to save some money on some 360 games, Rumble Roses XX just dropped down to $39.99.

01:24:00.287 --> 01:24:04.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with MLB 2K6 on the Xbox 360.

01:24:05.048 --> 01:24:09.629
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also dropped on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the PSP quite a bit.

01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:13.849
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gradius Collection on the PSP has dropped to $19.99.

01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:17.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Boy Micro has dropped to $79.99, because I guess those things aren't selling.

01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:19.890
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dreamfall dropped down to $29.99.

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:20.370
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very cool.

01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:20.670
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:24:24.451 --> 01:24:28.192
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

01:24:28.312 --> 01:24:30.392
[SPEAKER_01]: But fear not, the show is not yet over.

01:24:30.812 --> 01:24:37.254
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening on the podcast, you get a new segment of Orange Lounge Radio a little bit later in the week on Wednesday or so.

01:24:37.274 --> 01:24:48.296
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to us live, though, whether it be here on Sunday nights when we tape on OrangeLoungeRadio.com or to our rebroadcast on All Games Radio Monday night and Tuesday morning, you only have to wait about 10 minutes.

01:24:49.276 --> 01:24:51.657
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:52.602 --> 01:24:57.573
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:24:58.034 --> 01:25:02.364
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
