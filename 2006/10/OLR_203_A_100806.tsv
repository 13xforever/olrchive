0	20320	Today, October 8th, 2006, rumors about next-gen sales at GameStop fly around the Internet,
20320	32760	angry NBA Live fans write a letter to EA, and a popular BS mascot moves to the PSP.
32760	36760	Hello everybody out there on the Internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36760	37760	Radio.
37760	42800	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
42800	43960	My name is Rob Roberts.
43960	44960	You might know me as Sky.
44960	48200	Joining me, not tonight, is Dark Sakura.
48200	49560	She actually has the night off.
49560	53400	Unfortunately, she had a funeral she had to go to today, so we hope all is well with her
53400	54840	and her family.
54840	56840	We do have, though, tonight, Loki joining us.
56840	57840	Tech master Loki.
57840	61640	Yes, and I'm wiping the salt off of this laptop here.
61640	65320	Were you having a late-night snack just before, I shouldn't say late-night, I guess more late-afternoon
65320	67520	snack before starting the show here?
67520	70080	Yes, McDonald's french fries.
70080	71640	That would definitely be salty.
71640	73040	That would be.
73040	77600	I'm sure it's going to be an interesting program tonight as it is just Loki and just myself
77600	78600	here in studio.
78600	84360	We have no third guest, no Miklotov, no Drew Nami, no other people really were available
84360	85360	tonight.
85360	88680	As somebody had suggested, we could do a third co-host through Skype, but I don't know.
88680	92840	There's something about you sitting here in studio and Jamie when she's here sitting in
92840	93840	the studio.
93840	94840	Somebody suggested that was a stupid idea.
94840	96880	Well, no, I don't know.
96880	100040	It might be something to try in the future, but just for right now, it's a little difficult.
100040	101580	You can't get that same.
101580	106000	For me, I know there's a lot of shows, podcasts out there that do the Skype co-host thing,
106000	108560	and if it works for your show, awesome.
108560	112840	That's a great way to get a variety of opinions, but this is just the way we've been doing
112840	117480	it for four years, and in the nine years I've been doing radio, I've never had a co-host
117480	118480	who wasn't in the studio.
118480	121280	I'll just start answering you with a ten-second delay.
121280	123400	How about that?
123400	127360	I guess if the person you're co-hosting with on Skype has a good connection, it's not so
127360	128360	bad, but we'll see.
128360	131840	We have some pretty good connections with our callers, and we will be hearing from them
131840	133160	a little later on in the program.
133160	139120	Of course, our chat room, always the ever-present, tonight, third guest, usually it's the fourth
139120	140240	guest, but tonight they're the third guest.
140240	141960	They get promoted.
141960	146360	I guess our chat room is the co-host substitute tonight, so if you want to join our chat room
146360	151400	and you are listening live here on Sunday night, head on over to www.orangelaunchradio.com
151400	152680	and click on Chat.
152680	157160	All right, let's get into games and start it off, Loki, talking about how was your gaming
157160	158160	week?
158160	160080	My gaming week was great.
160080	167920	I played a lot of Saints Row, and I finally got the 20-hour achievement for that game.
167920	173640	It's fun, and there's actually a whole section of the game I really hadn't explored yet.
173640	176760	It's just a really fun game, so I've been playing that, actually playing through some
176760	179040	of the storyline.
179040	183040	It's one of those games that you are allowed to cheat in it, but you can't get achievement
183040	187720	points doing it, so it feels good to actually play through the game, and to be honest, the
187720	192440	game's not that hard anyways, at least not the part that I'm at.
192440	193600	So I don't know, it's pretty fun.
193600	198320	And the storyline, I like the storyline so far to it, so yeah, it's worth checking out.
198320	203240	Other than that, I've been actually, well, I've been trying to play some PlayStation
203240	205040	2 games, but that didn't happen this week.
205040	208960	I have them all lined up to play next week.
208960	213240	Even games I shouldn't be having to play next week, I will be playing next week.
213240	215960	I see, okay.
215960	220640	But yeah, so lots of good stuff.
220640	224040	There's a lot of people out there that develop games that really leak stuff to the internet
224040	226540	pretty early, so.
226540	231680	And then, of course, just the usual, real quick comment from the chatroom, joshi16 says
231680	234120	the ending to Saints sucks.
234120	235680	Have you gotten that far where you saw the ending?
235680	237080	No, but I don't care.
237080	238080	So what if the ending sucks?
238080	239080	Big deal.
239080	242600	I mean, if your main character doesn't talk, so how great can it be?
242600	246080	I mean, it's just, they should have him do a monologue, that'd be hilarious, because
246080	248400	he's just standing there going, doo doo doo.
248400	252160	You know, a lot of video game endings suck now that I think about it.
252160	257040	It's like Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto's ending sucked, and you beat it so you can
257040	260840	have lots of rockets at your crib, so you can go blow up shit.
260840	265800	That's what I did today, I was, you know, playing, and I blew up cop cars and stuff,
265800	270280	and then I got on the train tracks, and I blew up the L train, and the train fell down,
270280	273760	and usually you can't jump off the tracks without dying, but since there's a big train
273760	277940	pile up next to the tracks, I just jumped on the trains and ran down, and it's fun.
277940	279440	It's fun running around hitting people.
279440	284280	I am looking for, though, because there is an exploit in the game where if you find an
284280	289960	armored car, you can actually take it back to your, you know, crib or whatever, and store
289960	293540	it in your garage, and once you've stored a car in your garage, you basically can respawn
293540	295120	the car numerous times.
295120	299320	Well, the one armored car has money in it, so you respawn it, blow it up, respawn it,
299320	302720	blow it up, and you keep taking the money out of it, so it's a little bit of an exploit,
302720	307760	but not technically cheating, because you're playing with the game's physics.
307760	310200	If that's their mistake, that's fine.
310200	314720	That's why the whole duping glitch in Oblivion, not really cheating, because it was there.
314720	315720	I did not put a code in.
315720	319400	And now the chat room is talking about video game endings, right?
319400	323360	And Jeremy Todd once says, who cares if the ending sucks, if the whole other part of the
323360	325600	game is good, who gives a shit about the ending?
325600	330000	And Joshi16 kind of seems to follow up with that, with saying in response to his comment
330000	332320	earlier, I was just saying, I still like the game.
332320	334160	So what if the ending sucked, huh?
334160	338200	You know what, and if the ending sucks, you just continue playing in multiplayer.
338200	343840	And then of course SmartAss starts its mouth off in the chat room here.
343840	344840	Where is it?
344840	347960	Oh, Joshi16 says the ending to Pac-Man sucks also.
347960	349960	Didn't I just restart?
349960	352440	No, you get a half-board at the very end.
352440	353440	You can actually look it up.
353440	358480	I was on a Wikipedia marathon this week, reading about different video games on Wikipedia,
358480	361400	and one of them I was reading about was Pac-Man, and they actually have a screenshot of the
361400	368480	256th or 255th board, the one that crashes out the machine, and it's only like a half-board.
368480	369600	It's funky looking.
369600	370600	Look it up on Wikipedia.
370600	372840	You shouldn't be playing that game that long anyways.
372840	375140	That is a long time to be playing one game.
375140	379640	I played Pac-Man this week though, because I just wanted to, I guess.
379640	380640	I don't know.
380640	385520	Okay, and I tried playing Totem Ball, and to be honest, I mean, this isn't a huge surprise
385520	391880	to me, because at E3 when I played Totem Ball, it sucked ass because you had people walking
391880	396380	behind you and it just cannot pick up your movements.
396380	401600	The main thing that comes down to these stupid games that use the camera for movement, like
401600	407440	the eye toy, is that in your typical gaming environment, you do not have a giant white
407440	410720	screen behind you to move in front of.
410720	414520	So I don't know what the fuck environment they test this stuff in, which I'm assuming
414520	420040	has a giant white screen behind them, but that does not work in the real world, so stop
420040	425720	making games that don't work in the real world in just a lab environment, because to be honest,
425720	430320	I can't get this game to work at all, and it's just, it's really sad because my room,
430320	434680	I mean, it's lit well enough I would believe, but I guess not.
434680	439280	So I don't want to have to make special lighting arrangements just to be able to play this
439280	444800	game, and to be honest, the game doesn't look that fun, so whatever, it's free, so I don't
444800	450280	feel like I wasted any money, but I'm not going to be buying any sort of eye toy play
450280	455920	compilations down the road for this vision camera, so I don't know.
455920	457740	I think it's kind of dumb.
457740	463200	But then I played Zuma a little bit, because Nelly was hogging it and playing lots of Zuma,
463200	469040	and then I don't know, I just tried to kind of mix it up a bit with the Xbox Live Arcade
469040	470040	games.
470040	471040	All right.
471040	472040	Very cool.
472040	475840	I also played Totem Ball this week, because I got an Xbox Live camera earlier this week,
475840	479800	so I'm finally there and using that online, and I'll tell you the things I like about
479800	481440	the camera, and I'll tell you things I don't like about the camera.
481440	485040	The things I like about the camera is being able to take your own picture, making your
485040	487360	own game or card picture, and having the cool little effects with it.
487360	488360	I think I have a good one now.
488360	489360	Yeah, you have a pretty good one.
489360	492240	I took a very emo picture and did this effect on it.
492240	495040	I wish I could copy it to my MySpace, it would be perfect.
495040	498040	Actually, I'm not sure if you can pull them up, you might be able to pull them up on the
498040	499040	Xbox website.
499040	500040	No, you can't.
500040	503800	It'll show, you know how you have the one that your friends can see, that's your gamer
503800	505400	picture that you took of the camera?
505400	508780	We also have to set the one for what your non-friends see, and that's the one that shows
508780	509780	up on Xbox.com.
509780	510780	That's lame.
510780	514400	So I still have the Doom guy as my icon.
514400	519040	But the other things I like about the camera is video chat is actually really smooth, and
519040	522880	pretty good looking for the camera, provided you don't get a defective one, like Logie
522880	523880	had at first.
523880	530340	I think video chat's pretty awesome, and it's fast, and it's pretty clear.
530340	533480	Some listener I was video chatting with tonight, and they didn't have a camera, so I couldn't
533480	539240	see theirs, but they said that I looked really good, and of course I always look good.
539240	543680	But then we were video chatting earlier in the week, Logie, and it was really smooth,
543680	547040	and plus I made your controller vibrate a lot, for no good reason, just because I could
547040	548040	actually.
548040	551360	Well, then we'll have to video chat later on tonight and I'll just hold down the R button
551360	552360	and shake it up.
552360	553360	Yeah, that's stupid.
553360	554360	Give it to your wife.
554360	556560	She'll enjoy that.
556560	560320	The things I don't like about the camera is totem ball.
560320	564280	Sorry, if you're going to get a camera just so you can play totem ball because it's free
564280	570160	on Xbox Live Arcade, not a selling point for the system, I'm sorry to say, and it basically
570160	577200	boils down to, I mean, the game is an interesting concept, and it seems to be done pretty well
577200	581240	in the graphical sense and all that stuff, but the controls stink.
581240	583840	Controlling it with my hands is no fun at all.
583840	587400	It's fun for about two minutes, and I do have a white wall in this house.
587400	589980	I do have a white background pretty much that I'm playing against.
589980	594040	The lighting is sometimes screwy because the light's coming in from the side, but even
594040	598880	then I didn't have a whole lot of problems with iToy, but this game, I just can't control
598880	599880	it the way I want it to.
599880	600880	It's not that great.
600880	604400	And to be honest, I think it'd be cool if they didn't update to it where you can use
604400	609000	the controller because I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard to program that in, but I mean
609000	611040	that would be nice because the game looks kind of fun.
611040	616520	It might be fun to play, you know, kind of like a marble blast type of game, but it's
616520	617520	not very fun.
617520	622240	I cannot get the damn thing to work, and it's frustrating, and after about two minutes playing
622240	626000	this thing, I'm like, fuck this, I'll go play something else.
626000	630480	And to be honest, if I paid for that, I'd be pissed off, and thank God they didn't,
630480	631480	you know.
631480	634640	They had the extra development time that they had because this game, you know, did come
634640	639320	out a couple weeks after the camera, you know, that they would get it right, but apparently
639320	646400	no, they didn't, so whatever, I guess they were like, fuck it, who cares, it's free.
646400	650680	I'll say this, I did enjoy the pinball minigame that comes with it quite a bit where you use
650680	651680	your hands as the flippers.
651680	655320	I mean, it's kind of just like a one gimmick thing, but the pinball game did not frustrate
655320	660080	me nearly as much as the actual game itself trying to control around, but the pinball
660080	662840	one's easy because you just wave your right hand and it moves the right flipper, you wave
662840	667280	your left hand and it moves the left flipper, and that was more entertaining for me than
667280	670560	the actual game game that was there, so.
670560	672080	I haven't tried the pinball yet.
672080	675560	It doesn't look like totem ball is too popular amongst my friends too, like, I got three
675560	679040	really easy achievements that aren't hard to get, and I think I have the highest gamer
679040	682840	score on totem ball if anybody on my friends list, and about, I have about 70 people on
682840	687820	my friends list, and about 10 or 15 of them have the camera, and you know, you know what
687820	691640	game I actually did play, and I, you know, because I know it supports the camera, was
691640	693040	Bank Shot Billiards 2.
693040	694040	How was that?
694040	697720	You know, it's interesting, I thought there was some 3D support where you can change the
697720	699520	camera angle or something.
699520	704760	I could not find that option whatsoever, so if it's there, it's hidden to me, because
704760	707000	I don't see it, but I did play it.
707000	710920	There was one achievement where you sink the nine ball in on a game of nine ball in the
710920	716640	first break, and I got that the first try, so that wasn't too hard, but the game, the
716640	718060	computer's fucking hard.
718060	723200	Luckily though, you can't adjust the computer difficulty, but it's pretty fun for a billiards
723200	728160	game, you can actually, you have pretty good control over it, so I like it.
728160	729680	Worth 15 bucks?
729680	736760	No, but luckily I got that with my live kit, my one year live kit, it came with it, so
736760	741960	I wouldn't pay $15 for that thing, that thing may be five bucks, but I don't know.
741960	742960	Gotcha.
742960	749200	Let's see, I wanted to mention some chat comments here, there's a lot of them going on here,
749200	756240	mostly a lot of people sharing about their gaming week, let's see, I feel bad I can't
756240	760600	pronounce this name, Tacte Poire, I think that is, says totem ball wasn't free, you
760600	766120	paid for it with the camera, I guess essentially you can kind of look at it that way, let's
766120	770680	see, and Ravens Dolphin says along the same lines, yes guy, it is free, you can't complain,
770680	772760	talking about totem ball, so whatever.
772760	777440	I didn't understand though that they threw in there with the 12 month camera bundle,
777440	783340	which is the one I ended up getting, because I got to swap it out at Gamestop, they only
783340	788900	have the gear bundle left, so some idiot employee gave it to me at equal cost, so I got a free
788900	796360	year of live for, well, free actually, so that was interesting, but it came with Robotron,
796360	801880	you know, and I already own Robotron, but that's the dumbest, I don't, why would you
801880	805360	throw that in there, it doesn't even support the camera, I mean, I just don't get that
805360	806360	at all.
806360	809680	For the live element, being able to play on live, it's a cheap little game that they can,
809680	811360	you know, demonstrate the live.
811360	816360	Put in like, I don't know, like hardwood hearts or something, you know one of the other games
816360	820120	that supports the camera, I would think that they would want camera supported games with
820120	822600	the camera, I don't know.
822600	825880	Alright, let's see what else I do with my gaming week, actually not a whole lot else,
825880	830960	it's pretty much the only new game I played, yeah, I'm rocking my brain here, I can't think
830960	835760	of anything else really new, oh, I'll think of one I played, I went back, because of all
835760	839560	the love I was giving to this game recently on the show, I went back and found a copy
839560	844840	of Civilization 1, and I got it running on the computer, and I took over the world once
844840	846360	this week, it was fun.
846360	847360	That's excellent.
847360	850040	That's one of my favorite games of all time right there, I almost bought Civ 4 for the
850040	855180	PC, but I needed to have a price drop first, because those Civ games always drop in price
855180	857560	later on, so I'm waiting for that.
857560	859760	Well, I was playing also Cookie Mama.
859760	860760	How was Cookie Mama?
860760	865440	It was actually pretty fun, I figured out how to play the game now, so it works pretty
865440	870360	well for me, and it's just like a warrior type of game, it's basically a bunch of mini
870360	874880	games and you cook something, and some are very easy, some are very hard, some will frustrate
874880	879240	the hell out of you because it's just not sensitive enough, or what the case may be,
879240	883440	but I don't know, it's kind of fun, I think you might get bored with it after a while
883440	890000	though, but yeah, that's a really tough thing about the DS games, it's a lot of them, they
890000	894200	have a really short attention span for me, it's not anything I can go back and play and
894200	897680	play and play over and over again, like for example, Grand Theft Auto, I can go back and
897680	903080	play that anytime, and it's still interesting to me, I don't know.
903080	906240	Alright, well that's it for my gaming week, anything else for you?
906240	908520	I believe that's all I had.
908520	912880	Alright, now the chat room was asking us about this, and since we don't have Jamie here tonight
912880	915520	and the segment's a little bit shorter because of it, we got a little time to talk about
915520	917240	this.
917240	921080	Video gaming showed up in a couple shows this week, and of course, one that was very well
921080	925240	known that a lot of people saw was the South Park episode with World of Warcraft, what
925240	926240	did you think?
926240	927240	What did you think of the South Park episode with World of Warcraft?
927240	931160	That was pretty funny, and I probably didn't get a lot of the humor in it because I don't
931160	934320	play World of Warcraft, but it was still funny though, it was hilarious.
934320	939480	I thought it was really well done, but I don't know, for me, I just kind of wish, I don't
939480	943320	know, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge South Park fan and I love the movie, it's one of
943320	947880	my favorite movies ever and I love a lot of the other stuff they do, but this episode
947880	953640	for me, it just wasn't that same satire that I like out of the other stuff.
953640	956800	I don't know, I think the problem was just the plot, I just didn't really like the plot,
956800	960920	it seemed a little, I don't know, I just kind of wish they could have, I think I read a
960920	964740	comment on one of the gaming sites where other people talk about this, where maybe Cartman
964740	967680	could have been running a string of Chinese gold farmers or something, that would have
967680	968880	been funny.
968880	979200	I don't know, it was a little cheesy, but they did a very good job integrating the game
979200	985040	with the show, but because of that, it kind of felt like an infomercial to me.
985040	988200	It felt more like an infomercial, unless it's satire.
988200	992040	Or even better, here's a better description of it, it felt like someone making a machima
992040	997120	of the World of Warcraft game set to the audio track of South Park.
997120	1003280	It's like if you were to take a classic episode and just kind of make a machima from it.
1003280	1008760	And of course, the funniest part of the whole show was, mom, bathroom, bathroom.
1008760	1014560	But my mind's in the gutter like that, that made me laugh really hard.
1014560	1019100	And a lot of people, some people are bitching about, oh, the Horde wasn't in it, or oh,
1019100	1022720	their characters weren't the right levels, and if you're probably complaining about these
1022720	1027520	types of things, you're probably exactly who these guys were trying to make satire out
1027520	1028520	of.
1028520	1031520	Any time you're going to incorporate a game into a TV show, it ain't going to be perfect.
1031520	1033920	Well, I bet you anything they're trying to do that on purpose.
1033920	1038320	Probably, and I think all things considered, they did a pretty decent job.
1038320	1041000	I think, yeah, it would have been nice to see a Horde character in there, because I
1041000	1044000	play a Horde character myself, but at the same time, the more I think about it, the
1044000	1047360	more I go, you're starting to look like that fat guy at the computer with the drool and
1047360	1049640	the chip on his shirt, so I stopped thinking about it.
1049640	1053360	It's going to be the end of the world of Warcraft.
1053360	1055760	Did you see The Office with the Call of Duty 2 references?
1055760	1057880	I saw the clip of it.
1057880	1059040	I saw like half of it.
1059040	1062400	I didn't see the whole episode, but I saw like half of it, and it seemed to get it pretty
1062400	1063400	well.
1063400	1064600	The Office is funny.
1064600	1068200	I have to admit, though, I'm a big fan of the British Office, and I watched that whole
1068200	1073200	one before the American one showed up, and so it's always weird for me to watch the American
1073200	1077240	episodes of The Office, but it seems like they did a good job making satire a Call of
1077240	1078240	Duty.
1078240	1080760	I watched season one and two of The Office, and I just started watching it last night.
1080760	1081760	I don't have to borrow them.
1081760	1084320	They're just different shows, except for the very, very first episode, it was the same
1084320	1087940	plot in the British one and the American one.
1087940	1091200	We got up through the second episode, which is Diversity Day.
1091200	1092200	Yeah, yeah.
1092200	1093200	That's always funny.
1093200	1094200	All right.
1094200	1099800	No, you know, I appreciate that the chat room is going to link me to a torrent of The Office,
1099800	1101320	but I still have it on the DVR.
1101320	1104480	I'm just being lazy when it comes to watching it, so I will watch the whole thing.
1104480	1106280	You know what I'm very disappointed about?
1106280	1110800	I didn't even realize they had started a new season of it yet, drawing together.
1110800	1111800	There was a new season.
1111800	1112800	It was horrible.
1112800	1113800	I watched the season premiere, and it was horrible.
1113800	1114800	It was horrible.
1114800	1115800	I'm sorry.
1115800	1118240	I didn't find it funny at all.
1118240	1119240	I don't know.
1119240	1121000	That's another show I really like that had really weird scenes.
1121000	1122000	It was pretty funny.
1122000	1123000	I don't know.
1123000	1124000	All right.
1124000	1130000	Anyway, now we're turning into TV talk, so we better get back to, I mean, a lot of nerds
1130000	1132200	like their TV.
1132200	1134240	They have a link type character in it.
1134240	1137360	I mean, it's game related a little bit, so whatever.
1137360	1138360	All right.
1138360	1142000	Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1142000	1143280	We don't have a whole lot tonight.
1143280	1144840	Obviously, Jamie will be back this week.
1144840	1145840	She's out this week.
1145840	1147880	The DVR previews are continuing tonight.
1147880	1150280	You'll hear those a little later in this segment.
1150280	1153440	I want to give a quick shout out to one of our listeners who's in chat tonight, El Mullet,
1153440	1157440	who hasn't been there for a long, long time, but he says he wanted to come to chat tonight
1157440	1162120	because he's getting married next week, so he's getting married next Sunday, so he wanted
1162120	1167920	to have his, I guess, a good last Sunday night hurrah of single life here in the chat room,
1167920	1168920	so I appreciate that.
1168920	1169920	I'm wearing the shirt.
1169920	1170920	You are.
1170920	1171920	Loki's wearing the shirt we bought him.
1171920	1172920	Jamie and I got him a shirt before he got married.
1172920	1175920	It says, Game Over, with the husband frowning and the wife smiling.
1175920	1176920	It's great.
1176920	1177920	You've probably seen it on the internet, other places.
1177920	1178920	It's at Target.
1178920	1179920	Yeah.
1179920	1181920	A lot of people have it, but that's cool.
1181920	1184000	All right.
1184000	1185440	Anyway.
1185440	1189560	Any advice for the gamer about to cross into married life?
1189560	1196680	Hopefully your wife-to-be likes games, otherwise you'll be playing a lot less games.
1196680	1201320	My suggestion is find something that she likes to do.
1201320	1203520	My wife is totally jaded on games.
1203520	1206600	She says, yet she plays Zuma.
1206600	1212680	I seriously think she's played the 360 more than me this week, and I'm not kidding.
1212680	1214640	It's like crack to her.
1214640	1220480	She gets so frustrated if she can't beat certain levels, and she's stuck on level six right
1220480	1225400	now, and it's just, oh man, she'll be just sitting there for hours, and I'm just like,
1225400	1230640	can I play Saints Row, and she's like, I'm playing Zuma.
1230640	1233640	And just so you know, Elle Mullet, we have the stripper coming soon for the chat room
1233640	1234960	bachelor party.
1234960	1238920	DMN, go ahead and start taking it off.
1238920	1239920	Just kidding.
1239920	1240920	All right.
1240920	1241920	Let's get into this gaming news, for real.
1241920	1242920	All right.
1242920	1248160	So anyways, this week was a whole bunch of Wii news rumors, et cetera, and of course
1248160	1253800	a lot of them were kind of based around GameStop, and especially since GameStop had their wonderful
1253800	1259320	annual sales conference in Dallas, lots of information leaking out of there, and of course
1259320	1261360	lots of secondhand accounts and stuff.
1261360	1265680	So we don't know how much of this is true, but we're reporting it to you anyways.
1265680	1269400	One big thing, though, coming out of it was that GameStop said at the show that they would
1269400	1276160	be the only retail at launch to have Wii demonstration units available in their stores.
1276160	1280520	And so basically you can go test out the game systems as well.
1280520	1284680	I don't know if that's entirely true, but maybe at launch, yeah.
1284680	1288840	Maybe they might be a little bit later to get them to other stores, but I don't know.
1288840	1292380	You know what I was thinking about with this whole thing, with the GameStop having the
1292380	1294200	exclusive Wii?
1294200	1298400	You know, this actually may have some truth in my mind, whereas I think some of the other
1298400	1300960	rumors we're going to get to are a bunch of poopy.
1300960	1304040	I think the interesting thing about this, remember when you came on and you did your
1304040	1308240	episode 198 report, the big one that was really controversial, where you had all these, you
1308240	1311400	know, things you were talking about, you know, all this upcoming news, and one of the things
1311400	1315300	you said is that there's not going to be any demo kiosks for the Wii.
1315300	1317560	They told us that they're not doing demo kiosks for the Wii.
1317560	1322000	But almost that exact same day, pictures were being posted on the internet elsewhere from
1322000	1325960	these GameStop EB people that had pictures of the Wii demo unit that was coming in.
1325960	1331480	But now that this story has come out, I kind of go, this could make both reports accurate,
1331480	1335440	where of course you guys were told there's not going to be any kiosks because you're
1335440	1336440	not getting any.
1336440	1337440	They're all going to GameStop.
1337440	1342320	And here's the other thing too, our sales rep or whatever from Nintendo deals with only
1342320	1345800	a certain region, maybe say the West Coast or whatever.
1345800	1351400	He doesn't deal with, you know, GameStop, you know, which would be the Dallas area.
1351400	1356800	So where his information might be that there are no kiosks, you know, someone else that
1356800	1361080	works for Nintendo, yeah, there are kiosks because they're going to GameStop.
1361080	1362080	So kind of interesting.
1362080	1363080	It makes sense.
1363080	1366880	Because I think about that, and I think about trying to put all that together, because I
1366880	1369560	don't think the reps that were talking to you were full of BS.
1369560	1375280	I know you're not full of BS, despite what other people on the internet might think.
1375280	1377520	It kind of adds up for me that this could be true.
1377520	1383880	And the thing, I think the thing, the major difficulty with having a GameStop kiosk, or
1383880	1388680	not a GameStop kiosk, but a Wii kiosk is that the controllers don't have a wired version.
1388680	1391920	There's no one that you can just kind of tie down.
1391920	1396160	And I mean, sure, you could probably, you know, put some, you know, steel cable on there
1396160	1397160	or something like that.
1397160	1398400	Yeah, I don't think it'd be that hard to put a steel cable on.
1398400	1401200	But I mean, still, it's going to look kind of funky.
1401200	1404000	Or put a sensor on the back so when someone tries to walk out the door with it, beep,
1404000	1405000	beep, beep, beep.
1405000	1406000	That won't stop anybody.
1406000	1407000	I don't know.
1407000	1408000	That would come off so easy.
1408000	1409000	But anyway.
1409000	1410000	It's an idea.
1410000	1411000	Geez.
1411000	1412000	The other news that came out actually.
1412000	1414680	I want to ask real quick though, what about now, the thing that makes me think this may
1414680	1419880	not be true is that there was this story earlier about Wal-Mart said that they weren't going
1419880	1421120	to be doing it or whatever.
1421120	1425200	And I'm thinking, well, when was Wal-Mart given an option if it's exclusive to GameStop,
1425200	1426200	right?
1426200	1427200	Well, who knows?
1427200	1428200	I mean, I don't know.
1428200	1429200	I don't know.
1429200	1430200	So take it with a grain of salt.
1430200	1431700	Maybe, okay, well, let me put it this way.
1431700	1435020	Maybe they weren't the only ones that were going to be exclusive.
1435020	1438760	Maybe it was going to be GameStop and Wal-Mart and maybe a few other retailers.
1438760	1442600	But the retailer said, hey, we don't want this demo unit because we're afraid that
1442600	1443600	people are going to get hurt.
1443600	1447000	And to be honest, after seeing some of these people try to navigate the self-checkout,
1447000	1451120	yeah, they will get hurt because they're too dumb to figure it out.
1451120	1454920	Jeremy Todd 1 says in our chat room, they could just tie a wire where the wrist strap
1454920	1455920	goes.
1455920	1457480	That wouldn't be that hard at all.
1457480	1458480	Okay.
1458480	1460480	That's a perfectly good option.
1460480	1465200	And then I could just take my X-Acto knife out of my pocket and cut the wrist strap.
1465200	1467680	Okay, it's not going to be...
1467680	1469600	Steel cable does not exactly cut with...
1469600	1470600	Oh, oh, oh, I see.
1470600	1471600	Take out the wrist.
1471600	1472600	Never mind.
1472600	1473600	I'm thinking this whole other thing.
1473600	1474600	Never mind.
1474600	1477320	And actually, I don't know if that would work either because wrist straps, those little
1477320	1481320	things on them, the string's pretty thin, so I don't know if you'd be able to stick
1481320	1482320	steel cable through.
1482320	1483320	Ah, whatever.
1483320	1484320	Whatever.
1484320	1485320	Okay, let's just say you were able to stick steel cable on there.
1485320	1488080	Steel people are going to throw them at people and it's just...
1488080	1490240	We'll just see what freaking happens when it happens.
1490240	1491240	And to be honest...
1491240	1492240	We're a month away.
1492240	1497080	Just because they don't have a kiosk setup, they can set up a kiosk type setup anyways.
1497080	1501000	I mean, you know, who's to say someone can't just bust one of these things open and just
1501000	1502000	create their own?
1502000	1504120	So they'll be out there.
1504120	1505120	Whatever.
1505120	1508920	Anyways, there's some other news also that GameStop was going to be the first to be...
1508920	1514520	Or they're going to be selling the Zune in store, so if you have a fascination with the
1514520	1517080	Microsoft music player, well, there you go.
1517080	1518520	You can buy it from them.
1518520	1522040	It's kind of interesting though, because the other mention on this one article is that
1522040	1525240	this is kind of the first time that they've done this, but if I remember correctly, they
1525240	1528520	were actually selling Creative Nomads in their store as well.
1528520	1533560	Maybe not iPods, but they have been selling music playing devices.
1533560	1538960	Now some of the more unbelievable rumors from the whole GameStop thing, one of them being
1538960	1546040	that the GameStop Wii kiosk is going to require a credit card to be able to be used.
1546040	1553440	So I imagine with this kind of logic here, probably giving them your license or credit
1553440	1560080	card so you don't walk out with the Wii controller, maybe so that they don't have to strap them
1560080	1561080	down.
1561080	1564840	I don't know why, when I first read this story, I imagined in my mind having to slide your
1564840	1567840	credit card through the Wii demo thing, and I'm like, no way!
1567840	1572380	I would never do that, because they might charge me for something.
1572380	1577320	So it'll force me to put a pre-order on the Wii, like all that peer pressure they give
1577320	1581000	you at those stores.
1581000	1584720	That makes more sense though, it's kind of like playing pool at a bar, you have to give
1584720	1587480	them your driver's license so you don't walk out with the cue ball.
1587480	1595460	I guess, but then again, I hope they don't do this, but I guess you have to, because
1595460	1601340	people walk away with this stuff, so better safe than sorry, I guess.
1601340	1604400	I still do think overall it's probably a BS story.
1604400	1607920	JeremyTodd1 in chat brings up a good point, this can't be true!
1607920	1611240	Nintendo's trying to market to everybody here, so why would they make the kiosk only available
1611240	1613280	to older people who have a credit card, that's a very good point.
1613280	1616320	Or driver's license, yeah, seriously.
1616320	1618240	I don't think so.
1618240	1624680	Another story though, coming out of the whole GameStop conference thing, they're saying
1624680	1632700	that basically GameStop, the PS3 pre-orders are based on loyal customers.
1632700	1638840	Basically from an anonymous tip given to Kotaku from a GameStop manager, each GameStop store
1638840	1643720	will receive an average of six systems, more for the higher volume stores and less for
1643720	1644720	the dead stores.
1644720	1649200	One of two systems can be given to employees at their store manager's discretion, I don't
1649200	1652560	think so, but that doesn't sound right at all.
1652560	1655000	The rest are going to be given out to store regulars.
1655000	1659480	If a manager feels that he has a customer who is very loyal, shops there often, reserves
1659480	1663120	many things, they may call them and ask them if they want to guarantee one of the remaining
1663120	1664120	four consoles.
1664120	1669840	Apparently all four of the remaining consoles are handed out in this fashion.
1669840	1676720	That doesn't even sound right at all.
1676720	1678940	Not every GameStop will get the same amount of PS3s, I don't think.
1678940	1683760	It would depend on volume, so that whole, you know, you get four or whatever, no, don't
1683760	1684760	buy it.
1684760	1685760	That's a crap policy too.
1685760	1687520	There'd be so much scandal that goes along with that.
1687520	1688520	And they're not going to go away.
1688520	1692400	And to be honest, they're not going to give them to employees at all.
1692400	1696920	If they're going to get four or six, you know, they're not going to do it.
1696920	1700400	And I think that kind of goes with other stories that we've had about the reservations.
1700400	1702400	Right.
1702400	1706520	I just want to say real quick, by the way, we had an issue in our chat room, if you're
1706520	1710480	listening live on Sunday, where apparently some folks were not able to get in because
1710480	1712960	somehow the limit got set on the chat room.
1712960	1713960	That's been removed.
1713960	1714960	I just took it off.
1714960	1717760	So if you've been trying to join chat and weren't having any luck, try again, you should
1717760	1718760	be able to get in now.
1718760	1721560	And these are chat rooms that full though.
1721560	1722560	Excellent.
1722560	1723680	All right.
1723680	1726680	So no PS3 preorders from regulars, huh?
1726680	1727680	Yeah.
1727680	1728680	All right.
1728680	1731440	Well, there might not be any preorders from anyone at all.
1731440	1735680	1UP is speculating this week that at the annual GameStop conference held last Saturday in
1735680	1736680	Dallas.
1736680	1740320	Quote, the great thing is there is a lot of demand, said Steve Morgan, president of GameStop,
1740320	1741800	but launch is one day.
1741800	1744420	And really the key to this business is what flows after the launch.
1744420	1746000	We did learn a lesson last year.
1746000	1750800	I think the lesson is caution and optimism at the same time.
1750800	1754480	GameStop's decision not to guarantee your hardware preorder is by no means carved in
1754480	1755480	stone.
1755480	1759400	But from this point, it seems a pretty sure thing from a strictly business point of view.
1759400	1763440	Last year, GameStop caught some heat after it mistakenly took in more Xbox 360 preorders
1763440	1765440	than it had the capacity to fulfill.
1765440	1767360	Certainly, that would be correct.
1767360	1771440	We all remember people were blaming GameStop when they couldn't get their Xbox 360s.
1771440	1775720	But people were saying what they promised them.
1775720	1778120	But certainly, they've learned their lesson, it sounds like, and they won't be doing that
1778120	1780040	again anytime soon.
1780040	1785840	But the other thing I heard was that that's not exactly true either, that they are going
1785840	1790560	to be getting some or they're going to be starting taking preorders because this is
1790560	1792360	basically the point that they made.
1792360	1793360	Look at Hawaii.
1793360	1798320	Hawaii's been doing preorders for the PlayStation 3, and we right now are testing that thing
1798320	1799320	out.
1799320	1803480	So yes, they are taking preorders on it, but they're saying that the preorders are probably
1803480	1808120	not going to start until November.
1808120	1816000	You might start seeing less information about the GameStop stuff circulating the internet.
1816000	1821000	A report came in to Gotaku earlier this week that says that basically, the GameStop employees
1821000	1823760	have been told to shut their mouths.
1823760	1827240	I'm a manager at an EB GameStop location, and recently we received this great little
1827240	1829360	scare notice to pass around the store.
1829360	1832720	Basically it's been sent in response to all the news about the PS3 Wii preorders, as well
1832720	1837560	as to scare employees off from buying PS3s and selling them online.
1837560	1838560	So interesting.
1838560	1841560	It was this interesting little cease and desist, and you can read the whole thing if you go
1841560	1844480	over to Gotaku and you can click and find the whole thing.
1844480	1849080	But it's basically your typical, you know, we'd like to issue a friendly reminder about
1849080	1852080	the company policy, blah, blah, blah type thing.
1852080	1856160	So in other words, yeah, stop coming on the internet and blabbing everything because man,
1856160	1860280	people can't keep their mouths shut when it comes to some of these rumors.
1860280	1861280	That's kind of funny.
1861280	1864760	Well, one of these people that can't keep their mouths shut about rumors or release
1864760	1866760	dates and stuff would be me.
1866760	1870600	And well, there's lots of good stuff coming, well not a whole lot of good stuff, but still
1870600	1874800	some pretty good stuff coming out this week on all the systems.
1874800	1878960	Starting off with the DS, and Rob, apparently I was wrong earlier, Clubhouse Games is coming
1878960	1879960	out this week.
1879960	1880960	Alright!
1880960	1882180	So that would be pretty good.
1882180	1889080	Crash Boom Bang, if you happen to be craving some Crash the Bandicoot party games, I don't
1889080	1891440	know, might be something for you.
1891440	1896780	Anyways, we also have Legend of Spyro A New Beginning coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox
1896780	1897780	and the GameCube.
1897780	1902780	If you have a 360, yeah you can play the Xbox version of that if you're really craving some
1902780	1905840	Legend of Spyro.
1905840	1911480	Also Avatar is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the GameCube, and all the portable
1911480	1913760	systems as well.
1913760	1916020	Should be pretty cool.
1916020	1919560	You're a fan of the Family Feud, that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Game
1919560	1920560	Boy Advance.
1920560	1922560	Worst game I've played at E3, I'm sorry to say.
1922560	1924660	And don't get me wrong, I love the Feud.
1924660	1930040	I love the Richard Dawson days where he'd make out with all the women on the show, but
1930040	1934980	something is just not right in the past 20 years now with Family Feud.
1934980	1935980	So sorry to say.
1935980	1939040	Mortal Kombat Armageddon also coming out this week on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
1939040	1940040	Oh, that's this week.
1940040	1941040	Oh, very cool.
1941040	1944600	Maybe not so much on the Xbox this week, because I mean the date we have in our system right
1944600	1950280	now, somehow Midway moved their date just on the Xbox version, so don't be surprised
1950280	1955640	if you don't see it in stores this week, but you know, it is slated though for this week
1955640	1958220	though for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, so.
1958220	1967880	But whatever, anyways, then of course on, you've got Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on PlayStation
1967880	1970320	2 and Xbox as well as PSP.
1970320	1973120	For the PC, you're getting a few things.
1973120	1979800	Warhammer 4000 Dawn of War Dark Crusade, Devil May Cry 3 Dante's Awakening Special Edition
1979800	1988640	on the PC, also Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf 07, and Dirt Origin of Species.
1988640	1990640	Alright.
1990640	1992640	So that should be pretty good.
1992640	1994760	Next week's going to be lots of good stuff, including Bully.
1994760	1995760	Oh, okay.
1995760	1998200	And you're going to be getting that I'm sure?
1998200	2000440	I'll be getting it one way or another.
2000440	2001440	Alright.
2001440	2002440	Let's see.
2002440	2005640	Next week in Japan, I've got Japanese release dates for you, or I should say this week in
2005640	2009000	Japan, not a whole lot of pickings for you guys in Japan this week.
2009000	2010440	It's kind of a slow week.
2010440	2016240	MotoGP 2006 is on its way, along with Rockstar Table Tennis making its way in Japan this
2016240	2017240	week.
2017240	2022380	I also forgot one in PlayStation 2, and this one is awesome, God Hand is coming out this
2022380	2023380	week.
2023380	2024380	Oh.
2024380	2025380	And definitely worth checking out.
2025380	2028080	I'll actually have a review for that next week.
2028080	2030560	That's one of the games I have on my slate to play.
2030560	2031560	Alright.
2031560	2032560	Sounds good.
2032560	2036080	Jamie's not here tonight, so sorry to our European listeners, but we're just going to
2036080	2037240	not do your dates tonight.
2037240	2038680	No, I'm kidding.
2038680	2040240	I got you guys covered.
2040240	2041240	Here we go.
2041240	2045120	Coming out this week, the week of the 13th, you guys have Crazy Frog Racer and English
2045120	2048600	Training on the DS, you know, because your English isn't good.
2048600	2049600	No, I'm kidding.
2049600	2054120	Obviously, that's going to other territories besides just Britain probably will be released
2054120	2057560	in the other European territories.
2057560	2061640	The Power Stone Collection on the PSP, a lot of people saying there's the reason to get
2061640	2062640	a PSP right there.
2062640	2063640	I'll tell you what.
2063640	2066360	I played it at E3, not the same magic at the Dreamcast.
2066360	2067360	I can't explain it.
2067360	2070960	It's just not the same magic, but hey, if you're a Power Stone fan, you might get a
2070960	2071960	kick out of this.
2071960	2076320	And then Resident Evil 4 Platinum Edition making its way to PlayStation 2 along with
2076320	2081480	Wild Arms 4, Steam Bot Chronicles also on the PlayStation 2 this week.
2081480	2086640	If you're a Game Boy Advance player, Rebel Star Tactical Command coming out for the GBA
2086640	2087960	this week in Europe.
2087960	2088960	Have fun.
2088960	2089960	Cool.
2089960	2094180	Some interesting information, which is not, well, I shouldn't say it's too surprising,
2094180	2099480	but Miyamoto's actually come out to say that the Wii is, well, the hardware is basically
2099480	2100480	a GameCube.
2100480	2106000	And, you know, that's kind of like saying a Pentium 4 is basically a Pentium 1.
2106000	2112360	Basically that it's on the same kind of architecture as the original GameCube, but of course, it's
2112360	2117060	going to be a little bit more souped up, you know, kind of like, you know, how a DS is
2117060	2121120	almost a Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance is almost a Super Nintendo and so on and so
2121120	2122120	forth.
2122120	2124400	And, yeah, I mean, big deal.
2124400	2128120	I mean, that's not a big surprise seeing all these games ported from the GameCube over
2128120	2129680	to the Wii, so.
2129680	2133360	Well, you know, now the anti-Nintendo fan base, though, is like, you know, oh, you're
2133360	2135520	paying $250 for a controller.
2135520	2136520	Have fun, suckers.
2136520	2139200	And, you know, people are also saying about, you know, Super Smash Brothers.
2139200	2142080	I just saw a post in the live-drama community this afternoon that was talking about, you
2142080	2147280	know, Smash Brothers that's coming out on the Wii is not really going to be using the
2147280	2150920	Wii functionality in the main game, which is not much of a surprise.
2150920	2154640	I mean, you know, I kind of wouldn't want it to, but now they're saying, why don't
2154640	2156040	they just do it on the GameCube then?
2156040	2159760	Well, just because it's, well, the specs are still upgraded just because, it's just
2159760	2165360	like saying, you know, a PC nowadays, you know, which is still based on the same architecture
2165360	2170800	as a PC from like, say, 15 years ago, I mean, granted, they're not the same thing, but
2170800	2176400	they're based off the same architecture, so, so, you know, big deal.
2176400	2177400	Like I say, play the games.
2177400	2179160	If you like the games, great.
2179160	2180160	Who cares about specs?
2180160	2185280	I mean, you know, I don't give a shit of how many USB ports are on this thing.
2185280	2186280	It does not matter.
2186280	2187360	So, just play the games.
2187360	2188360	If you like them, great.
2188360	2194400	I mean, after all, Pac-Man wasn't really pushing, you know, the graphics or anything, so, whatever.
2194400	2195400	Alright.
2195400	2201240	Bandit in our chat room says, Miyamoto said it himself that the Wii is a souped-up GameCube.
2201240	2203280	Certainly a quote a lot of people have been running with this week.
2203280	2208920	I saw that posted on a lot of blogs, but, you know, so, Sony said that the PlayStation
2208920	2210400	3 is future proof.
2210400	2216520	I don't care cancer, so, I mean, I don't believe that either, but whatever.
2216520	2217520	Alright.
2217520	2222600	Well, if you are excited to be getting your hands on a Wii soon, good news for you.
2222600	2226380	The Wii production is exceeding expectations.
2226380	2233000	According to UBS, 2 million Wii consoles were completed in the third quarter, July to September,
2233000	2236080	to support the upcoming fourth quarter launch.
2236080	2240280	In addition, at least 7 million, and potentially as high as 9 million more units, are in the
2240280	2243360	build plan for the fourth quarter of 2006.
2243360	2248200	This production ramp handily exceeds a publicly announced target for 6 million units to ship
2248200	2249200	by year-end.
2249200	2253160	So, Nintendo may have been playing it conservative a little bit with their launch numbers, and
2253160	2254760	they may have more.
2254760	2259920	I still think, if you want to get this on launch day, you probably are going to be having
2259920	2262040	to do the pre-order or the campout or one of those things.
2262040	2264920	I don't think you're going to be able to walk into the store and pick one up if you didn't
2264920	2266200	do some type of pre-planning.
2266200	2270160	And it's great that they're going to have that many units, but this thing's on all the
2270160	2274680	Christmas lists, all the different retailers' Christmas lists, and once they launch their
2274680	2280400	marketing campaign for this, it's going to be the hot Christmas item, so you better get
2280400	2282640	on those pre-order lists as soon as you can.
2282640	2285240	How important are the launch days, you think?
2285240	2289940	Because there's been a lot of focus in the past couple generations of gaming about the
2289940	2292720	launch day and how the launch goes.
2292720	2298080	We had the Xbox 360 launch, which was this big ass deal, and the Wii launch is shaping
2298080	2300040	up to be huge as well.
2300040	2304480	PlayStation 3, it's kind of getting some mixed reactions, but certainly if you're a hardcore
2304480	2307760	Sony person, this is something you're looking forward to as well.
2307760	2309160	But how important is launch day?
2309160	2313800	Because I go back and I think about PlayStation 2, and I think about, I remember seeing the
2313800	2317440	lines on TV and stuff, but I don't remember being so excited about a PlayStation 2 right
2317440	2319440	on launch day.
2319440	2324120	How important is the launch, and yet the PlayStation 2 was still the most successful of the last
2324120	2325120	gen.
2325120	2326120	It's just the bragging.
2326120	2327120	It's the E-Penis thing.
2327120	2331200	It's basically, I've got the console and you don't, or I'm playing it first.
2331200	2333000	Everyone's got to be first.
2333000	2335000	So I don't know.
2335000	2340520	I think what's important is how many units they can sell by the end of the year.
2340520	2345720	Right now in the U.S., I believe there are up to about 3 million Xbox 360 units.
2345720	2348880	Don't count on me on that, but I think that's about where they're at.
2348880	2352200	I think worldwide they're about 6 million.
2352200	2358200	And if they can sell 4 million Wii units in the United States alone, and I'm sure they're
2358200	2364380	going to be able to sell all 9 million units of the Wii, they're going to blow past the
2364380	2366520	competition really quick.
2366520	2370280	And that's going to probably show something to publishers, because to be honest, publishers
2370280	2374280	are going to make games mainly for those systems that have the most units out there because
2374280	2376420	they can sell more units of their game.
2376420	2380480	And that's going to be important when you don't want this thing being like the GameCube
2380480	2385300	where it didn't sell as many units, and so the third-party publishers didn't really support
2385300	2386300	that system.
2386300	2391620	Whereas now, if they can blow 9 million units away by the end of the year worldwide, that's
2391620	2395280	going to be a big, like, hello, pay attention to this.
2395280	2397200	But again, this is all speculation and what-ifs.
2397200	2398200	Exactly.
2398200	2400120	So the damn thing could tank, for all we know.
2400120	2401120	It could.
2401120	2403120	It could very well tank, but I don't think so.
2403120	2407000	I think four-hour lines of E3 pretty much tell you it's not going to tank.
2407000	2408000	Alright, we'll see.
2408000	2412200	Bandit in our chat room says, Best Buy better not say, oh, you can buy a Wii from us, but
2412200	2413640	only as a package deal.
2413640	2414640	Agreed.
2414640	2415640	They are.
2415640	2419600	I bet you they will, because, and this is something that I will not buy at a Best Buy.
2419600	2422140	Well, I'm going to tell you why they're going to do that, though.
2422140	2425680	The reason why they're going to do that is because there's no margins on this thing.
2425680	2430520	That's one thing I mentioned a couple episodes ago, is that the margins on the Wii system
2430520	2435960	is only a few bucks, and they have to sell it in a bundle to make money off this thing,
2435960	2440360	because they're only making like ten bucks off of each system, so it makes sense to bundle
2440360	2445080	it with some controllers and, say, a game.
2445080	2446280	I know our company-
2446280	2449640	Well, that's going to be what dooms the sales of the Wii, if it-
2449640	2450640	Not necessarily.
2450640	2454920	I mean, you don't have to buy it that way, because you can go into a Walmart or whatever
2454920	2457440	and buy it just by itself.
2457440	2461440	But some of these companies are going to want to try to do this, and you just don't have
2461440	2462440	to buy from them.
2462440	2466400	Or if you're really desperate to get the system at launch, then yeah, you will buy that.
2466400	2467760	But I don't know.
2467760	2471740	No one's saying anything for sure, but don't be surprised that they do, because they've
2471740	2473920	done it in the past with other systems.
2473920	2476900	Anoush in our chat room says, Sky, do you know of any major stores that are doing a
2476900	2478480	midnight release?
2478480	2480640	I imagine a lot of them.
2480640	2483000	Imagine most will probably have to.
2483000	2484640	Who did ones for Xbox 360?
2484640	2486200	That's probably who's going to do them for Wii.
2486200	2489200	I mean, you can just kind of go down that list right there.
2489200	2491720	Whoever did them for Xbox 360 is probably going to do them for Wii.
2491720	2496880	I know a lot of GameStops do them for Madden, and just games, not even systems.
2496880	2502320	So I would imagine if there's a big GameStop in your area, or EB, any of those type, they
2502320	2504360	will probably be doing a big midnight party.
2504360	2508480	God, does that mean we have to go out and report on a midnight launch?
2508480	2509480	Fuck no.
2509480	2512280	Why do I have to go out there, dude?
2512280	2514200	I'm getting mine early.
2514200	2516760	For the goodness of better journalism.
2516760	2518080	Yeah, okay.
2518080	2522800	Listen, I don't want to be like the news crew, because you know every fucking year they always
2522800	2524320	have some stupid station.
2524320	2528600	Look, there's people outside waiting in the cold for their new game system.
2528600	2529600	What's this new game system?
2529600	2530600	The why?
2530600	2533920	Why must you have the Nintendo why?
2533920	2534920	It's Wii.
2534920	2535920	Why?
2535920	2537920	Why is it called...
2537920	2538920	It's Wii.
2538920	2539920	Why?
2539920	2545320	I believe I may have actually already committed this program to be working with other podcasters
2545320	2551760	in some type of Wii news live on launch night.
2551760	2554160	By the way, there's a staff meeting after the show.
2554160	2556920	Way to go, Rob.
2556920	2557920	Loser.
2557920	2563260	One of the games you might be expecting, I'm not sure if at launch, Bionicle Heroes is
2563260	2566880	going to be heading to the Wii, and Bionicle Heroes is going to be pretty good.
2566880	2571520	It's actually done by Traveler's Tale, which I believe is people behind Lego Star Wars
2571520	2577080	and the Lego Star Wars original trilogy game, so of course you would imagine, okay, Lego's
2577080	2580440	game, Bionicle Heroes, yeah, makes perfect sense.
2580440	2585240	This of course, information coming from the ESRB website, which seems to be leaking a
2585240	2592480	lot of info on upcoming games for the Wii, so look for that soon.
2592480	2595360	All right.
2595360	2596360	I will.
2596360	2597360	Thank you for that.
2597360	2598360	Excellent.
2598360	2603280	A lot of people were bitching about the Wii not having a wireless, or I'm sorry, a wired
2603280	2607840	internet port in it because of course it supports the wireless internet, but what if your house
2607840	2610560	isn't wired for wireless?
2610560	2611560	Then you're screwed, right?
2611560	2612560	Not necessarily.
2612560	2613560	Not necessarily.
2613560	2617840	Here's the thing, the dongle, remember the dongle that you got for the Nintendo DS?
2617840	2621400	You can use that on your Wii, and that was something I had speculated a while back that
2621400	2623440	you could probably do, so that's pretty cool.
2623440	2625040	So that's something you can do.
2625040	2630680	Also, Nintendo has announced they are going to provide an ethernet kit so that you can
2630680	2633800	directly connect the console to a standard internet router.
2633800	2636920	It's going to go from USB to ethernet.
2636920	2637920	Probably.
2637920	2638920	Yeah.
2638920	2642720	Good job Nintendo in squelching that little cry of...
2642720	2645200	I can't imagine those would be too expensive.
2645200	2646200	I guess...
2646200	2647200	Well, how much was the other dongle?
2647200	2648200	$30?
2648200	2649200	$35?
2649200	2650200	It's like $25 or something.
2650200	2653560	I'm going to be honest though, if you're going to be spending that kind of money to get your
2653560	2656960	Wii online, you might want to think about just upgrading to a wireless router for your
2656960	2657960	house.
2657960	2658960	They're not that expensive these days.
2658960	2663120	Yeah, wireless router, and if you really don't want to spend the money, just spend $25 on
2663120	2669520	the wireless thing, because then that way you can use the Wi-Fi with your DS as well.
2669520	2671000	And with your PSP, I think.
2671000	2672000	So...
2672000	2673000	Why not?
2673000	2674040	Al Mullet brings up a good point.
2674040	2675880	You can use the dongle on your Wii.
2675880	2678600	Why doesn't that sound right?
2678600	2679600	I don't know.
2679600	2680600	Good point.
2680600	2681600	It sounds dirty.
2681600	2684320	You know, I wonder what's kind of interesting about that?
2684320	2686000	I wonder if you could use...
2686000	2688000	No, no, you wouldn't be able to use that.
2688000	2693720	I was going to say use the Xbox 360 one, but that's $99, and that plugs into the Ethernet
2693720	2694720	port anyways.
2694720	2695720	All right, anyways, sorry.
2695720	2696720	I digress.
2696720	2703560	Now, there's been a lot of, in the past, people cheating in MMOs, basically hiring people
2703560	2710120	to farm gold for them or to sell accounts to them that are high level and stuff like
2710120	2711120	that.
2711120	2715600	And they're kind of doing something like that on the Xbox 360 with someone's gamertag.
2715600	2716600	That's right.
2716600	2723280	Someone actually has their gamertag and their Xbox 360 hard drive up on eBay for sale.
2723280	2731560	The gamertag rants6, who has, by the looks of it, over 30,000 points on their gamer score.
2731560	2734760	From what I understand, this is actually the number one ranked gamer score on my gamer
2734760	2738120	card net, I guess so.
2738120	2747960	The guy's got 19 bids as of right now, as of when Xbox 360 updates reported it.
2747960	2753160	They've actually, and the biddings end up to $5,000 already.
2753160	2759400	And the reason why the guy's selling it, well, he's buying a PS3.
2759400	2760400	Very interesting.
2760400	2761400	Interesting.
2761400	2763440	But why would you buy this just to have the gamer score?
2763440	2766720	You know, this kind of goes along with another story that it didn't make our show roll for
2766720	2769760	tonight, but surely a lot of you guys have heard about this.
2769760	2775040	There's that company out there that's offering to inflate your gamer score or earn you 3,000
2775040	2779160	gamer score points for, what was it, 3,000 points for 200 bucks, something like that.
2779160	2780160	Why?
2780160	2781160	Why would you do that?
2781160	2785920	For about 10 bucks, you can do the same thing, and even more than that.
2785920	2787720	And why you would even want to spend this kind of money.
2787720	2790720	What do you mean, for 10 bucks, you can do the same thing?
2790720	2792700	There's ways you can inflate your gamer score.
2792700	2793700	You can cheat.
2793700	2794700	How?
2794700	2795700	How?
2795700	2796700	Saves.
2796700	2797700	Saves.
2797700	2798700	Saves.
2798700	2799700	Saves.
2799700	2800700	Transferring game saves.
2800700	2801700	Certain game saves on games will actually unlock achievement points for you.
2801700	2802700	I got you.
2802700	2803700	Okay.
2803700	2808640	Or you can actually hack saves to do that as well.
2808640	2811840	Why you would spend $300 on this?
2811840	2817640	Why would you even give away your personal account to some stranger that's beyond me?
2817640	2818640	I don't know.
2818640	2821760	But I bet you anything, this is what they're doing, is they're just $300 for like 10 minutes
2821760	2822760	of work.
2822760	2823760	Oh, whoops.
2823760	2825760	That story wasn't a show roll.
2825760	2827760	It was the next thing I was supposed to go over.
2827760	2828760	Oh, well.
2828760	2829760	Well, excellent.
2829760	2830840	We talked about it now.
2830840	2834760	We prepped really hard for tonight's show, ladies and gentlemen.
2834760	2835760	Hooray.
2835760	2839360	Well, that's pretty awesome that you mentioned that.
2839360	2841760	Yeah, so let's just keep it moving.
2841760	2842760	Anyways.
2842760	2844320	I'm a psychic.
2844320	2849200	You know, I'm glad that there's people out there actually concentrating on Xbox Live
2849200	2853840	because it just wasn't really that annoying yet.
2853840	2859180	And so now there's a brand new device out there for Smack Talking called Smack Talk.
2859180	2860180	It's $29.99.
2860180	2867440	It's basically a little device that plugs into your headphone port on your Xbox 360
2867440	2874280	controller and it allows you to record five different Smack Talks into the device.
2874280	2880160	So you can push the button at any time to release an automated, you know, blah, blah,
2880160	2881160	blah.
2881160	2882160	I pwned you, noob.
2882160	2886680	You know, stuff like that, so hooray.
2886680	2890240	Or what most people do is like, you know, take South Park recordings from that World
2890240	2894280	of Warcraft episode, you know, total pwnage, and they just let him put it on the stupid
2894280	2895280	thing.
2895280	2896280	Yeah, so it comes through.
2896280	2898040	You know, because, you know, it's all.
2898040	2901600	You know what's going to be on mine when I get one of these.
2901600	2904320	Draw four, bitch.
2904320	2905320	Just kidding.
2905320	2907080	I'm not getting one.
2907080	2910700	I want to point out some of the chat in our chat room about the whole inflating your gamer
2910700	2911700	score thing.
2911700	2916800	El mullet has a method, one, sign up with Gamefly, two, rent four games at a time, three,
2916800	2919440	play the games, four, earn mad points.
2919440	2921600	And VX JasonXV agrees with that.
2921600	2923160	Just freaking play.
2923160	2924360	Seriously.
2924360	2928000	And Jeremy Todd one wants to ask, Loki, if you could sell your account for $5,000, would
2928000	2929000	you?
2929000	2931920	Sure would, because I'll just start a new one.
2931920	2933440	Who cares?
2933440	2936920	El mullet would like to share he's almost at 10,000 points through the Gamefly renting
2936920	2937920	method.
2937920	2939200	I think he does have the highest score on my friends list.
2939200	2942240	I just don't have time to play that many games.
2942240	2947240	I have that many games, too, to play, but I just don't have the time.
2947240	2952360	SSJ wants to know what are the five pre-programmed things in the Smack Talk device.
2952360	2957640	He says, FAG, FUCK, BITCH, OWNED, RETARD are the five that will be pre-programmed.
2957640	2958640	Yay.
2958640	2961640	He said FAG.
2961640	2967520	Why, people, why?
2967520	2972240	Well one of these games you may or may not be Smack Talking on is NBA Live 07, but I'll
2972240	2974880	tell you where the Smack Talk's going right now.
2974880	2977280	It's going to EA.
2977280	2983920	Quote from this community, NBA Live community letter to EA from nbalive.org, quote, at one
2983920	2987600	time EA was producing the best titles money could buy and one had little reason to look
2987600	2988600	elsewhere.
2988600	2991400	Now gamers have a sense that if you want the best, it's not EA.
2991400	2995660	Whether it's looking at the NBA 2K series for our basketball game fix, users leaving
2995660	2999720	Battlefield 2 because they feel the problems will never be addressed, or former FIFA players
2999720	3004120	moving on to Pro Evolution winning XI, it's a sense that we are all sharing.
3004120	3008480	We look at NBA Live over the last few years and we see the same basic game being re-released
3008480	3010640	with new fancy features.
3010640	3013640	You know, it's kind of funny because that's what all the non-sports games fans say about
3013640	3014640	these games.
3014640	3019000	You know, when they don't understand Madden 06, they go, it's just a roster update.
3019000	3020000	It's even worse.
3020000	3021000	It kind of is.
3021000	3022000	Even the fans are admitting it's just a roster update now.
3022000	3023000	It's even worse with FIFA.
3023000	3025360	FIFA, they release two games a year.
3025360	3028440	The same elemental problems from the last few years are still there.
3028440	3030880	Some have been tweaked, but the overall issue still exists.
3030880	3033540	While there are plenty of new features, it gives the impression that EA is saying in
3033540	3036660	response to the lingering issues, yeah, well hey, look at this.
3036660	3041520	Be it an All-Star Weekend, Superstar Moves, or Dynasty editions, while those editions
3041520	3045540	are nice to have, it is piling on a base that cannot support it instead of addressing the
3045540	3046760	underlying fractures.
3046760	3050720	EA is just constructing a new structure on the old crumbling foundation.
3050720	3055760	On this letter, they put YouTube links to actual videos of the game being buggy.
3055760	3060080	Very interesting rise up of the fan community against this, especially that part where they
3060080	3062360	say they're all going to go play NBA 2K.
3062360	3063360	That's pretty...
3063360	3064360	Them's fighting words.
3064360	3068700	You've got to talk in numbers because, you know, they keep buying the games, you know.
3068700	3072240	I would be very interested to see if EA responds to this at all.
3072240	3073240	Probably not.
3073240	3075280	If they don't, that's...
3075280	3076280	I don't know.
3076280	3080760	I mean, you can probably lose these rabid fans on the internet and still make money
3080760	3085920	on the game, but, you know, you need to do something about this free publicity or it's
3085920	3086920	going to go away.
3086920	3087920	Well, you know what?
3087920	3090840	I mean, all EA seems to care about nowadays is money anyways.
3090840	3095780	I mean, you saw the stories about how they're releasing, you know, Madden tutorial videos
3095780	3100220	on how to throw passes and stuff, and they're charging on Xbox Live or, you know, Marketplace
3100220	3104120	for this stuff, and it's basically stuff that should have been included in the game in the
3104120	3108200	first place, and now they're charging, you know, premium content for this.
3108200	3109200	Fuck them.
3109200	3112160	A lot of responses in our chat room.
3112160	3116480	Jeremy Todd 1 says, EA's response, blame Canada, not us.
3116480	3120360	Deep Man says, EA games is never going to lose money as long as they're publishing Maxis
3120360	3123040	games.
3123040	3127360	JoeShe16 says, EA will not acknowledge their own faults.
3127360	3134000	Black Wolf says, EA's response, you already bought our game, bitches.
3134000	3135000	Interesting.
3135000	3136000	Yeah.
3136000	3138040	I mean, you bought them, so whatever.
3138040	3141640	I would just, you know, wait to play them or wait to buy them, you know, wait for the
3141640	3145200	reviews to come out so you can find out if it's buggy or not because, you know, this
3145200	3150560	year actually 2K7 got a way better review than live, so we'll see.
3150560	3151720	All right.
3151720	3153820	All this news about buggy games makes me angry.
3153820	3156920	You shouldn't, you should release your game with minimal faults.
3156920	3160680	I mean, there's going to be bugs and everything, but minimal faults and not try to patch it
3160680	3165400	all in the back end, or just not playing patch at all like some companies do, so that makes
3165400	3166400	us angry.
3166400	3167400	So you know what that means.
3167400	3169200	It's time for the FUs of the Week.
3169200	3173200	You got it.
3173200	3184480	Since Jamie's not here tonight, I will enter an FU to traffic on her behalf because that's
3184480	3185840	her typical FU.
3185840	3188920	Loki, should I be entering an FU to traffic on your behalf as well?
3188920	3189920	I don't know.
3189920	3192400	I wasn't really driving that much this week.
3192400	3198800	No, I'm going to say FU to stupid people that are trying to use the self-checkout because
3198800	3204840	it actually takes longer for them to self-checkout than it would to check out normally, and I
3204840	3209040	think that's kind of funny sometimes that, you know, they put self-checkout place, you
3209040	3214760	know, machines in these stores that, you know, people are not smart enough to actually be
3214760	3216920	able to use, like Walmart, for example.
3216920	3221360	There should not be self-checkout at Walmart because, my God, these people don't understand
3221360	3227000	anything other than hunting games, so please remove the self-checkout from Walmart or like
3227000	3231080	block it off, you know, I can test, you know, you should have a smart card, you know.
3231080	3232580	I'm a smart person.
3232580	3234680	I should be able to use this device.
3234680	3235680	You're dumb.
3235680	3236680	Go away.
3236680	3240480	I have a much lamer FU to enter in tonight.
3240480	3245780	My FU would go to BeatMania 2DX, specifically doubles mode, because it's hard.
3245780	3251000	It's really hard, like, you know, I can pass, I'm okay at the regular seven-key mode, but,
3251000	3254800	well, actually I've lost a lot of skill because I haven't played a lot regularly, so FU did
3254800	3259760	that, the fact that there's no working BeatMania 2DX arcade machine in town anymore, but I
3259760	3260760	really suck at doubles.
3260760	3263560	I mean, I've been trying to use your controller to play doubles, and I passed, like, some
3263560	3265040	fours, but that's about it.
3265040	3266240	I suck.
3266240	3270360	It's very humbling to go from being able to pass sevens and some flashing sevens to, like,
3270360	3272800	oh shit, I can only play fours now because I'm doing doubles.
3272800	3279440	Well, I can only play fours, and some fours, not even all of them, because I suck at doubles.
3279440	3281840	Of course, the people that don't play BeatMania that listen to this show is like, what the
3281840	3282840	hell is he talking about?
3282840	3284340	What the hell is that?
3284340	3287280	It's so hard, but anyways.
3287280	3291960	Some interesting stuff coming out about NBA 2K7, actually, for the PlayStation 3, which
3291960	3294680	will be coming out around launch.
3294680	3298680	What's interesting, and, you know, you might remember before when they were talking about
3298680	3302960	the PlayStation 3 how it's going to support up to seven controllers on one system, because
3302960	3311240	it has the limitations of Bluetooth, but NBA 2K7 will support seven players offline, which
3311240	3314040	is pretty interesting.
3314040	3315520	Seven players is kind of an odd number.
3315520	3318840	I would think six players would be good enough, since it's, you know, three on three.
3318840	3321000	Do any of you have that many friends?
3321000	3322000	I don't have that many friends.
3322000	3325840	I have four controllers, and I never play with four friends, because no one wants to
3325840	3326840	play.
3326840	3327840	It's so lonely.
3327840	3331880	All in all, I'll come over and play, but not NBA, because I suck at those games.
3331880	3333780	Double dribble for life, man.
3333780	3334780	Double dribble.
3334780	3338480	But, see, like, three on three would be cool for, like, NBA Street or something like that,
3338480	3344520	you know, where they actually have three on three, but seven players is kind of, you know,
3344520	3347360	so you have three on one and four on the other.
3347360	3349960	They should have one person that's the ref.
3349960	3350960	That'd be funny.
3350960	3351960	Or the mascot.
3351960	3352960	Or the cheerleader.
3352960	3353960	Cheerleader.
3353960	3354960	Excellent.
3354960	3355960	That'd be cool.
3355960	3361320	So, new peripherals are coming out for the PlayStation 3.
3361320	3365480	Of course, I can't remember if we mentioned it last week, but the controller's being named
3365480	3366480	the Sixaxis.
3366480	3368440	Didn't we talk a little bit about that last week?
3368440	3371680	I can't remember if that was last week or not, but, of course, the controller's officially
3371680	3375460	been dubbed the Sixaxis, and IGN's posted some very nice little screenshots of all these
3375460	3379840	devices that are coming out, and, by the way, have you been to GameStop recently?
3379840	3384000	I saw some big banner ads for PlayStation 3 and Wii in the store, like, kind of place-holding
3384000	3387080	where they're going to put them up on the wall when they get those systems in.
3387080	3388080	Not yet.
3388080	3391040	You can see a nice, big, clear picture of the PlayStation 3 controller on there.
3391040	3392240	And then the memory card USB.
3392240	3395760	Well, I don't really need to see a big, clear, you know, controller picture because I've
3395760	3396760	touched it.
3396760	3397760	Whatever.
3397760	3398760	Whatever.
3398760	3399760	I'm just saying.
3399760	3400760	I'm just saying.
3400760	3401760	If you want to see one.
3401760	3402760	I like the remote, though.
3402760	3403760	Yeah, the remote's pretty cool.
3403760	3404760	The remote has, like, 10,000 buttons.
3404760	3406880	It looks like one of those all-in-one style remotes.
3406880	3409160	Looks like a Harmony remote for the 360.
3409160	3412080	I'm still weirded out by the whole Spider-Man font on the PlayStation 3, though.
3412080	3415760	Did you like that remote that they had, the Harmony one, made by Logitech?
3415760	3416760	You're like, that remote's $150?
3416760	3417760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3417760	3419600	I still remember seeing that at Best Buy or whatever.
3419600	3420600	I was like, what the?
3420600	3423440	You don't need to spend $150 on a remote unless it will never get lost.
3423440	3427120	But if it's that big, it probably won't ever get lost, so maybe it would be worth it.
3427120	3428120	I don't know.
3428120	3430120	It should be, like, attached to the PS3.
3430120	3435480	Anyways, one thing that Sony's been combating, other than a lot of bad press, is that the
3435480	3439920	PlayStation 3 is overheating and having, you know, some sort of a similar problem as the
3439920	3442020	Xbox 360 did.
3442020	3446280	And this is basically coming from Tokyo Game Show because a lot of the units were overheating.
3446280	3448480	But from what I heard about Tokyo Game Show, that place wasn't air-conditioned.
3448480	3450360	Wouldn't that fucking suck?
3450360	3456440	I mean, as hot as it is in, you know, E3, let alone without AC, fuck that.
3456440	3457440	I wouldn't go.
3457440	3458440	That's a good deterrent, though.
3458440	3459440	They should do that.
3459440	3460440	Turn off the air.
3460440	3461440	But, um...
3461440	3463840	Then the place would smell so awful.
3463840	3465880	Oh, it probably does anyways.
3465880	3468800	So anyways, so yeah.
3468800	3473600	Basically they were having overheating problems at Tokyo Game Show because, you know, the
3473600	3477280	temperature of the building, which is so high.
3477280	3481200	What's interesting, though, is I didn't hear about any overheating problems on the 360
3481200	3485800	or you know, the Wii's or anything like that from Tokyo Game Show, so...
3485800	3486800	I don't know.
3486800	3487800	I guess we'll see at launch.
3487800	3488800	This is why I don't...
3488800	3489800	I don't know.
3489800	3492800	I don't know if I want to buy a PlayStation 3 at launch.
3492800	3494720	It's just too much stuff to get wrong.
3494720	3499280	Plus, that thing weighs about 15 pounds from what I heard.
3499280	3503200	I've already decided I'm not getting one to launch because there's nothing coming out
3503200	3504400	at launch I'm interested in playing.
3504400	3505400	Exactly.
3505400	3506400	Sorry, Sony fans.
3506400	3507400	That's just how I honestly feel about it.
3507400	3508400	There's nothing I really want at launch.
3508400	3510240	It's all about the games for me, you know.
3510240	3513200	Maybe if they had a Twisted Metal or maybe, I don't know.
3513200	3514200	Oh, I don't know.
3514200	3515200	Final Fantasy 13 or something.
3515200	3517400	Final Fantasy 13 would be cool, but to be honest...
3517400	3520900	Well, then that would be kind of stupid seeing as 12's coming out at the end of October,
3520900	3523200	but still, you know, you still get my point.
3523200	3525440	There needs to be something...
3525440	3528520	And if there is something like that, then I need to be hearing about it real soon.
3528520	3531400	What do you think about those rumors that, of course, you know, this is nothing new,
3531400	3534080	but that the launch is actually going to be delayed?
3534080	3536160	They seem to be really picking up steam this week.
3536160	3537160	I wouldn't be surprised.
3537160	3539680	I mean, think about what happened in the spring.
3539680	3541320	Oh, yeah, it's coming out.
3541320	3542320	It's coming out in spring.
3542320	3543320	It's coming out in spring.
3543320	3544320	It's summer now.
3544320	3545320	Oh, yeah, it's not coming out in spring.
3545320	3547320	I forgot to mention.
3547320	3549160	Oh, yeah.
3549160	3550160	That sucks.
3550160	3555200	I wouldn't be surprised if I see the news story for it, but right now I'm going to expect
3555200	3561480	it to come out November 17th, and when it doesn't, I'll just be like, well, that's nothing
3561480	3567560	new, but if they fucking miss this year's Christmas, that ain't good.
3567560	3568560	That's not good at all.
3568560	3571680	They're going to have another Neo Geo on their hands.
3571680	3572680	All right.
3572680	3576160	Well, there's some additional information out there on the PlayStation 3's interface
3576160	3577160	this week.
3577160	3583120	There's a video that shows up on GameTrailers.com, and it was a video that was taken during Tokyo
3583120	3584120	Game Show.
3584120	3587440	The video will show the web browser that's integrated into PlayStation 3.
3587440	3590920	Now, there's something 360 doesn't have on it that makes PS3 stand out a little bit.
3590920	3591920	I'm surprised that they don't have that.
3591920	3593920	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised, too.
3593920	3598440	NBA 2007 is in the video running at 1080p at 60 frames a second.
3598440	3603500	It shows a little bit of the PSP connectivity, some of the photo browser stuff, and the visualizer
3603500	3606320	that goes with the music.
3606320	3611400	Really think PlayStation Portable interface, that's the PlayStation 3 interface.
3611400	3613640	Well, at least it's consistent.
3613640	3619640	It is, but straight down to pop the game in, you have the background change and the little
3619640	3622680	animation icon video or whatever.
3622680	3627120	Yeah, same thing, so not a huge surprise.
3627120	3632720	What is kind of surprising, though, is that the PSP, there's been a lot of stuff going
3632720	3637920	on in the homebrew community for the PSP, including, and this is very interesting, a
3637920	3643480	brand new device that someone's actually creating called the PSP Touch Me.
3643480	3646240	Where did the PSP touch you?
3646240	3649080	Show me on the doll where it touched you.
3649080	3655320	It's actually going to be a device that plugs into the USB port and puts kind of a glass
3655320	3660920	screen over the actual screen, and you'll be using a stylus with it as a touch screen.
3660920	3668120	It's kind of interesting to see homebrew people come out with this stuff, thinking of ideas
3668120	3672880	that Sony themselves probably didn't even consider.
3672880	3676000	Even if Sony themselves came out tomorrow and said, hey, we're going to sell this touch
3676000	3683320	screen adapter for the PSP, would it, because like you say, the stuff has to be out there
3683320	3685120	for the games to be made for it.
3685120	3689680	That's why peripherals traditionally have not done very well, because they weren't very
3689680	3695520	well supported on the game front, so why would the PSP release a touch screen officially
3695520	3697640	if no third party games are going to support it?
3697640	3700600	I don't think they would anyways.
3700600	3702020	They might be accused of copying.
3702020	3703920	So what the hell can I use this for?
3703920	3709000	Homebrew games, which is only going to support some homebrew games right now, and it's designed
3709000	3713800	to use as an add-on, and it will cost you $56.
3713800	3718320	No word on when it's going to be released, but it looks pretty cool.
3718320	3721200	I don't know.
3721200	3724000	I'm not buying one, but it's kind of neat.
3724000	3727080	I think it's neat that the community came together and built that.
3727080	3729280	I think that's the neatest part of it for me.
3729280	3732440	They built a GPS device for this thing already, so...
3732440	3733920	Isn't there an official one now?
3733920	3736800	There is an official GPS device that's coming out later this year.
3736800	3740360	Could that happen where Sony decides to make an official one, or would they not do that
3740360	3744040	out of fear of being called Nintendo copiers?
3744040	3745680	I don't think they would.
3745680	3747520	I think they think it's gimmicky.
3747520	3748520	They didn't get any.
3748520	3751080	They did die twice, so I don't know.
3751080	3754600	But I mean, look at some of the cool stuff homebrew is doing.
3754600	3760080	They released a custom firmware this week also, a 2.71 firmware that runs homebrew games.
3760080	3767880	So you can run your current games right now for the PSP and homebrew without any modification.
3767880	3773200	The only thing is you can't upgrade yours using an official upgrader that comes out
3773200	3777920	later on, but you can always downgrade it back to 1.5 and then upgrade again if you
3777920	3778920	really wanted to.
3778920	3784240	But come on, they've broken every firmware that they come out with, so that's pretty
3784240	3787240	awesome though.
3787240	3790680	That's going to start to bring this segment to a close.
3790680	3793680	We're going to get into the DDR previews first.
3793680	3798120	We have been premiering over the past several weeks some new tracks from Dance Dance Revolution
3798120	3801380	Ultramix 4 coming out for the Xbox very soon.
3801380	3802380	Later this month, right?
3802380	3803380	This is last we heard.
3803380	3804380	Yeah.
3804380	3805380	Don't know.
3805380	3806380	Wait, what?
3806380	3807380	Ultramix 4.
3807380	3810320	Oh, no, no, that's in the middle of November 9th.
3810320	3811880	Oh, I thought it was this month.
3811880	3812880	No, November.
3812880	3813880	Well, shoot.
3813880	3814880	Well, that's all right.
3814880	3818840	It seems like there's been a lot of good reaction to the songs we've been playing so far, so
3818840	3822800	it'll be well worth the wait for a lot of folks, I think.
3822800	3826360	People are still busy with Supernova trying to figure out how to beat Pizza Box and all
3826360	3827360	that.
3827360	3831880	I completely forgot the mention about stuff about Universe and the price of it, which
3831880	3835560	you know, and I'm going to say this is kind of preliminary right now because I don't...
3835560	3837940	This is not coming to us from official sources.
3837940	3841240	This news that Loki's about to give is not from an official source.
3841240	3842960	It's from his distribution channels.
3842960	3843960	Yes, exactly.
3843960	3850360	Universe, $49.99 for the game by itself, $79.99 for the game plus a pad, which I don't understand
3850360	3855360	why they would do a by-the-self version of the game seeing as there's no pad for the
3855360	3858160	360 yet, so I don't know.
3858160	3860440	But hypothetically, the pad's going to have to be USB, right?
3860440	3861440	It is USB.
3861440	3868280	So does that mean if I happen to own a Red Octane pad that had the USB for my StepMania,
3868280	3870040	then I could use that on the 360?
3870040	3871040	Maybe.
3871040	3872040	Maybe.
3872040	3873040	Maybe.
3873040	3876520	Well, I mean, is it going to show into your system as two different games that there are
3876520	3877800	not two different games?
3877800	3880080	Well, it might not know.
3880080	3884840	Depends on how it maps out because, you know, that's compatible with the PC, you know, where
3884840	3890420	you can map the keys for a USB controller, but you can't just plug any USB controller
3890420	3895720	into the 360 and it will automatically work, so whether it supports it or not.
3895720	3899320	Well, take it with a little bit of a grain of salt, but those look to be the preliminary
3899320	3900320	prices for the game.
3900320	3904080	Yeah, it's just like BeatMania for the US, remember how we announced originally that
3904080	3907400	it had two SKUs, one without the controller, one with the controller, and then later on
3907400	3911200	they decided we're just going to do the one with the controller because no one has the
3911200	3914440	controller yet in the United States, which is stupid, but yeah.
3914440	3915440	That makes sense.
3915440	3916440	All right.
3916440	3921960	Well, let's get into some previews from DDR Universe, which is coming out sometime this
3921960	3923800	winter and DDR UltraMix 4.
3923800	3929240	We're going to start it off tonight with a song from DDR UltraMix 4, and our good buddy
3929240	3934240	Midihead also does songs under the name Monolithic, in fact, I believe that was the first name
3934240	3937480	he was using, and we call him our good buddy because he actually does the intro to our
3937480	3938840	show here at Orange Launch Radio.
3938840	3942240	If you ever wondered where that little ditty at the beginning of our program came from,
3942240	3943240	that was actually written by him.
3943240	3948320	Well, he has a song that's going to be in DDR UltraMix 4, and it's called Arms, the
3948320	3952560	Alpha Omega Extended Mix, and we're going to play it for you right now on the DDR Sneak
3952560	3974040	Eeks Orange Launch Radio.
3974040	3998240	It doesn't take so long, running in the gauntlet of my fears, drained of all my energy, slippin'
3998240	4018160	in the sea of all my tears, feelin' what is cold as I start to freeze, shoutin' out for
4018160	4035960	help as I go down, deep inside this liquid grave, the water rushes in, I start to drown,
4035960	4053760	you reach for my hand and hope to say, I looked upon you, concerned was in your eyes, your
4053760	4069680	tears, they hurt my back, seized me from sorrow, and dried the pain away, so I could
4069680	4087920	find another day, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't
4087920	4104800	turn so bad, now that I've got you in your arms, it doesn't turn so bad, now that I've
