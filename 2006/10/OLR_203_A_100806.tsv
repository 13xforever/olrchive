14356	25865	Tonight, October 8, 2006, rumors about next-gen sales at GameStop fly around the internet, angry NBA Live fans write a letter to EA, and a popular DS mascot moves to the PSP.
32682	37327	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37367	42352	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
42773	43754	My name is Rob Roberts.
43914	44935	You might know me as Sky.
45035	46657	Joining me, not tonight...
47416	48057	DarkSakura
72267	73548	And somebody suggested that was a stupid idea.
96141	97621	I'll just start answering you with a 10 second delay.
97661	98022	How about that?
123550	125072	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
142058	144580	I guess our chat room is the co-host substitute tonight.
144680	152587	So if you want to join our chat room and you are listening live here on Sunday night, head on over to www.orangelearnsradio.com and click on chat.
153147	155129	Alright, let's get into games and start it off.
155189	157451	Loki, talking about how was your gaming week?
157571	159412	My gaming week was great.
160173	164137	I played lots of, actually a lot of Saints Row.
164357	166999	I finally got the 20 hour achievement for that game.
167823	172747	It's fun, you know, and there's actually a whole section of the game I really hadn't explored yet.
173528	177591	It's just a really fun game, so I've been playing that, actually playing through some of the storyline.
178351	183775	And it's one of those games that you are allowed to cheat in it, but you can't get achievement points doing it.
184196	190420	So, you know, it feels good to actually play through the game, and to be honest, the game's not that hard anyways, at least not the part that I'm at.
192422	193443	So, I don't know, it's pretty fun.
193543	196125	And the storyline, I like the storyline so far to it, so...
196730	198752	Yeah, it's worth checking out.
199252	204917	Other than that, I've been actually... Well, I've been trying to play some PlayStation 2 games, but that didn't happen this week.
205377	207118	I have them all lined up to play next week.
208800	213123	Even games I shouldn't be having to play next week, I will be playing next week.
213423	213884	I see.
214224	214564	Okay.
215865	218307	But yeah, so lots of good stuff.
218948	224852	Man, you know, there's a lot of people out there that develop games that really leak stuff to the internet pretty early, so...
226488	230392	And then, of course, you know, just the usual... Real quick comment from the chatroom.
230632	233094	Joshi16 says, The ending to Saints sucks.
234075	235436	Have you gotten that far where you saw the ending?
235977	236858	No, but I don't care.
237038	238039	So what if the ending sucks?
238059	238399	Big deal.
238760	242383	I mean, if your main character doesn't talk, so, I mean, how great can it be?
242403	244625	I mean, it's just... They should have him do a monologue.
244645	248549	That'd be hilarious, because he'd just stand there going... You know...
249221	251462	A lot of video game endings suck now that I think about it.
251562	253143	It's like Grand Theft Auto.
253183	260706	Grand Theft Auto's ending sucked, and you beat it so you can have lots of rockets at your crib so you can go blow up shit.
261406	262186	That's what I did today.
262246	276632	I was playing, and I blew up cop cars and stuff, and then I got on the train tracks, and I blew up the L train, and the train fell down, and usually you can't jump off the tracks without dying, but since there's a big train pileup next to the tracks, I just jumped on the trains and ran down.
277032	277352	It was fun.
278078	278758	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
307748	310033	If that's their mistake, that's fine.
310073	314623	That's why the whole duping glitch in Oblivion, not really cheating because it was there.
314763	315625	I did not put a code in.
316118	319099	Now the chatroom is talking about video game endings, right?
319279	322261	And JeremyTodd1 says, Who cares if the ending sucks?
322301	324902	If the whole other part of the game is good, who gives a shit about the ending?
325422	331704	And Joshi16 kind of seems to follow up with that, saying in response to his comment earlier, I was just saying, I still like the game.
332285	334005	So what if the ending sucked, huh?
334105	334546	You know what?
334586	337507	And if the ending sucks, you just continue playing in multiplayer.
338107	342849	And then, of course, SmartAsses starts its mouth off in the chatroom here, saying,
343715	344195	Where is it?
344395	347576	Oh, Joshi16 says, the ending to Pac-Man sucks also.
348896	349956	Isn't that just restart?
350617	352397	No, you get a half board at the very end.
352417	353157	You can actually look it up.
353477	367340	I was on a Wikipedia marathon this week reading about different video games on Wikipedia, and one of them I was reading about was Pac-Man, and they actually have a screenshot of the 256th or 255th board, the one that crashes out the machine, and it's only like a half board.
367960	369181	It's funky looking.
369521	370301	Look it up on Wikipedia.
370836	371536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
396308	409957	The main thing that comes down to these stupid games that use the camera for movement, like the eye toy, is that in your typical gaming environment, you do not have a giant white screen behind you to move in front of.
410678	418523	So I don't know what the fuck environment they test this stuff in, which I'm assuming has a giant white screen behind them, but that does not work in the real world.
418923	424607	So stop making games that don't work in the real world, in just a lab environment.
424929	426490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
454680	456862	XBOX Live Arcade Games
478376	479058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
484793	485393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
514373	523435	The other things I like about the camera is video chat is actually really smooth and pretty good looking for the camera, provided you don't get a defective one like Loki had at first.
523775	529877	I think video chat's pretty awesome, and it's fast, and it's pretty clear.
530257	537339	Some listener I was video chatting with tonight, and they didn't have a camera, so I couldn't see theirs, but they said that I looked really good.
537979	539499	Of course, I always look good.
539519	543100	We were video chatting earlier in the week, Loki, and it was really smooth.
543570	546052	And plus I made your controller vibrate a lot for no good reason.
546613	547514	Only a little bit, actually.
547614	548054	Only a little bit?
548374	552178	Well, then we'll have to video chat later on tonight and I'll just hold down the R button and shake it a lot.
552218	552718	That's stupid.
553259	553799	Give it to your wife.
554080	554540	She'll enjoy that.
556502	559284	The things I don't like about the camera is Totem Ball.
560465	567832	Sorry, if you're going to get a camera just so you can play Totem Ball because it's free on Xbox Live Arcade, not a selling point.
568391	569352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
597896	600838	I just, I can't control it the way I want it to, it's not that great
615860	617321	It's just, it's not very fun.
617421	620504	I cannot get the damn thing to work, and it's frustrating.
620804	625248	And after about two minutes playing this thing, I'm like, fuck this, I'll go play something else.
625888	628991	And to be honest, if I paid for that, I'd be pissed off.
629291	641441	And thank God that in, you know, I think with the extra development time that they had, because this game, you know, did come out a couple weeks after the camera, you know, that they would get it right, but apparently, no, they didn't, so...
642708	646191	Whatever, I guess they were like, fuck it, who cares, it's free.
646651	651835	I'll say this, I did enjoy the pinball minigame that comes with it quite a bit where you use your hands as the flippers.
651875	653596	I mean, it's kind of just like a one gimmick thing.
653916	659400	But the pinball game did not frustrate me nearly as much as the actual game itself trying to control around.
659701	662623	But the pinball one's easy because you just wave your right hand and it moves the right flipper.
662643	664704	You wave your left hand and it moves the left flipper.
665005	669348	And that was more entertaining for me than the actual game that was there.
670658	671738	I haven't tried the pinball yet.
672039	674379	It doesn't look like Totem Ball is too popular amongst my friends, too.
674499	681201	I got three really easy achievements that aren't hard to get, and I think I have the highest gamer score on Totem Ball of anybody on my friends list.
681901	685122	I have about 70 people on my friends list, and about 10 or 15 of them have the camera.
686522	693124	And you know what game I actually did play, because I know it supports the camera, was Bankshot Billiards 2.
693684	694024	How was that?
694464	695644	You know what's interesting?
695724	698785	I thought there was some 3D support where you can change the camera angle or something.
699588	700729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
730109	733031	No, but luckily I got that with my live kit.
733651	735593	My one-year live kit came with it.
736893	738514	I wouldn't pay $15 for that thing.
738534	741636	That thing, maybe $5, but I don't know.
741816	742136	Gotcha.
743477	743917	Let's see.
744237	746739	I wanted to mention some chat comments here.
746799	748420	There's a lot of them going on here.
749060	751421	Mostly a lot of people sharing about their gaming week.
752402	752802	Let's see.
755467	756988	I feel bad I can't pronounce this name.
757348	760530	Tacte Pueri, I think that is, says Totem Ball wasn't free.
760550	761851	You paid for it with the camera.
762931	764732	I guess essentially you can kind of look at it that way.
765833	766313	Let's see.
766873	768574	And RavensDolphin says along the same lines.
768634	769575	Yes, guy, it is free.
769595	770355	You can't complain.
770555	772116	Talking about Totem Ball.
772236	784303	The one I didn't understand, though, that they threw in there with the 12-month camera bundle, which is the one I ended up getting because I got to swap it out at GameStop for, you know, they only have the gear bundle left.
785170	792395	Some idiot employee gave it to me at equal cost, so I got a free year of live for... No, free, actually.
793416	796618	That was interesting, but it came with Robotron.
796958	802601	I already own Robotron, but that's the dumbest... Why would you throw that in there?
802642	804002	It doesn't even support the camera.
804203	805603	I just don't get that at all.
805623	811247	For the live element, being able to play on live, it's a cheap little game that they can demonstrate the live.
811267	811787	Put in like...
813083	815326	I don't know, one of the, like, Hardwood Hearts or something.
815666	817248	You know, one of the other games that supports the camera.
817268	820612	I would think that they would want camera-supported games with the camera.
821273	821573	I don't know.
822254	822555	All right.
823676	824917	Let's see what else I do with my game of the week.
824957	825798	Actually, not a whole lot else.
825819	827701	That's pretty much the only new game I played.
829523	830624	Yeah, I'm racking my brain here.
830644	832507	I can't think of anything else really new that I played.
832607	832707	Oh!
833072	833993	I'll think of one I played.
834233	837815	I went back because of all the love I was giving to this game recently on the show.
838196	845321	I went back and found a copy of Civilization 1 and I got it running on the computer and I took over the world once this week.
845481	845901	It was fun.
846241	846822	That's excellent.
846982	848883	That's one of my favorite games of all time right there.
848903	855828	I almost bought Civ 4 for the PC but I needed to have a price drop first because those Civ games always drop in price later on.
856249	857309	So I'm waiting for that.
857690	859371	Well, I was playing also Cooking Mama.
859751	860432	How was Cooking Mama?
860452	861032	It's actually great.
861325	862246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
889392	891793	A lot of them, they have a really short attention span for me.
892373	895614	It's not anything I can go back and play and play and play over and over again.
895934	900976	For example, Grand Theft Auto, I can go back and play that any time, and it's still interesting to me.
902056	902376	I don't know.
903477	903757	All right.
903857	905017	Well, that's it for my gaming week.
905057	905657	Anything else for you?
906698	908238	I believe that's all I had.
908438	908658	All right.
908938	915561	Now, the chat room was asking us about this, and since we don't have Jamie here tonight and this segment's a little bit shorter because of it, we got a little time to talk about this.
917051	918953	Video gaming showed up in a couple shows this week.
919474	925040	And, of course, one that was very well known that a lot of people saw was the South Park episode with World of Warcraft.
925100	925661	What did you think?
925681	927483	What did you think of the South Park episode with World of Warcraft?
927503	928524	That was pretty funny.
928884	933269	And I probably didn't get a lot of the humor in it because I don't play World of Warcraft, but it was still funny, though.
933509	934170	It was hilarious.
934531	936513	I thought it was really well done, but I don't know.
936553	937874	For me, I just kind of wish...
939275	953603	I don't know, like, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge South Park fan, and I love the movie, it's one of my favorite movies ever, and I love a lot of the other, you know, stuff they do, but this episode for me, it just wasn't that same satire that I like out of the, you know, other stuff.
953643	955384	I don't know, I think the problem was just the plot.
955444	956645	I just didn't really like the plot.
956765	960427	It seemed a little, like, I don't know, I just kind of wish they could have, you know, they could have done something.
960447	968031	I think I read a comment on one of the gaming sites where other people were talking about this, where, you know, maybe Cartman could have been running a string of Chinese gold farmers or something, you know, that would have been funny.
968927	972330	I don't know, I didn't, I don't know, it was a little cheesy.
972350	984739	I mean, they did a very good job integrating, I can't talk tonight, the game with the show, but because of that, it kind of felt like an infomercial to me.
985120	988082	It felt more like an infomercial, unless it's satire.
988122	990124	Or even better, here's a better description of it.
990184	996589	It felt like someone making a mockument of the World of Warcraft game set to the audio track of South Park.
998170	998450	Basically.
998792	998952	Yeah.
999632	1002794	It's like if you were to take a classic episode and just kind of make a mocky mock from it.
1003174	1007416	And, of course, the funniest part of the whole show was, Mom, bathroom, bathroom.
1008677	1011158	But just my mind's in the gutter like that.
1011218	1012659	I mean, that made me laugh really hard.
1012679	1020583	And a lot of people, you know, some people are bitching about, you know, oh, the horde wasn't in it or, oh, their characters weren't the right levels.
1021063	1025786	And if you're probably complaining about these types of things, you're probably exactly who these guys are trying to –
1026547	1027387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1053317	1053837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1076241	1077442	Making satire of Call of Duty.
1077502	1079464	Actually, you just got season one and two of The Office.
1079484	1079764	Did you?
1079884	1081165	I'm going to have to borrow them.
1081185	1083607	They're just different shows, except for the very, very first episode.
1083647	1086869	It was the same plot in the British one and the American one.
1087910	1090973	We got up through the second episode, which is Diversity Day.
1091153	1092134	Yeah, yeah.
1092994	1093535	That's always funny.
1094275	1094535	All right.
1095136	1101321	No, you know, I appreciate that the chat room is going to link me to a torrent of The Office, but I still have it on the DVR.
1101341	1101581	I'm just...
1102165	1102965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1125389	1131555	Now we're turning into TV talk, so we better get back to... I mean, a lot of nerds like their TV.
1132175	1134197	They have a Link-type character in it.
1134277	1138280	I mean, it's game-related a little bit, so... Whatever.
1138701	1139061	All right.
1140255	1141936	Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1141956	1143197	We don't have a whole lot tonight.
1143257	1144718	Obviously, Jamie will be back this week.
1144778	1145659	She's out this week.
1145959	1147800	The DDR previews are continuing tonight.
1148120	1149761	You'll hear those a little later in this segment.
1150322	1155405	I wanted to give a quick shout-out to one of our listeners who's in chat tonight, El Mullet, who hasn't been there for a long, long time.
1155825	1161009	But he says he wanted to come to chat tonight because he's getting married next Sunday, so he wanted to kind of have his...
1163505	1168267	I guess a good last Sunday night hurrah of single life here in the chat room, so I appreciate that.
1168287	1168767	I'm wearing the shirt.
1168827	1169207	You are!
1169487	1170947	Loki's wearing the shirt we bought him.
1170967	1172428	Jamie and I got him a shirt before he got married.
1172468	1175809	It says, Game Over, with the husband frowning and the wife smiling.
1176109	1176389	It's great.
1176409	1178009	You've probably seen it on the internet, other places.
1178049	1178690	It's at Target.
1178990	1180210	Yeah, a lot of people have it.
1180550	1180890	That's cool.
1182271	1182531	All right.
1184992	1185312	Anyway.
1185392	1189333	Any advice for the gamer about to cross into married life?
1189433	1192234	Well, hopefully your wife to be likes games.
1193598	1195579	Otherwise you'll be playing a lot less games.
1196660	1198841	My suggestion is find something that she likes to do.
1200382	1200742	I don't know.
1201282	1202943	My wife is totally jaded on games.
1203464	1205945	She says, yet she plays Zuma.
1206866	1210748	I seriously think she's played the 360 more than me this week.
1211388	1212189	And I'm not kidding.
1212609	1214390	It's like crack to her.
1214550	1218992	She gets so frustrated if she can't beat certain levels.
1219012	1220733	She's stuck on level 6 right now.
1221334	1221734	And it's just
1222757	1226723	Oh man, she'll be sitting there for hours and I'm just like, can I play Saints Row?
1226743	1228165	And she's like, Blaine Zuma!
1228726	1234434	And just so you know, El Mullet, we have the stripper coming soon for the chatroom bachelor party.
1235215	1237098	DMN, go ahead and start taking it off.
1238800	1239201	Just kidding.
1240126	1241487	Alright, let's get into some gaming news, for real.
1241567	1246950	Alright, so anyways, this week was a whole bunch of Wii news rumors, etc.
1247731	1255596	And of course, a lot of them were kind of based around GameStop, and especially since GameStop had their wonderful annual sales conference in Dallas.
1256577	1263461	Lots of information leaking out of there, and of course, lots of second-hand accounts and stuff, so we don't know how much of this is true, but
1264039	1265220	We're pouring it to you anyways.
1265620	1275446	One big thing though coming out of it was that GameStop said at the show that they'd be the only retail at launch to have Wii demonstration units available in their stores.
1276066	1279748	And so basically you can go test out the game systems as well.
1280628	1283930	I don't know if that's entirely true, but maybe at launch, yeah.
1284511	1286792	Maybe they might be a little bit later to get them in other stores, but
1288702	1294387	You know what I was thinking about with this whole thing with GameStop having the exclusive Wii?
1294447	1300232	This actually may have some truth in my mind, whereas I think some of the other rumors we're going to get to are a bunch of poopy.
1301072	1314744	I think the interesting thing about this, remember when you came on and you did your episode 198 report, the big one that was really controversial where you had all these things, you were talking about all this upcoming news, and one of the things you said is that there's not going to be any demo kiosks for the Wii.
1314764	1317166	They told us that they're not doing demo kiosks for the Wii.
1317466	1319067	And here's the other thing, too.
1319087	1322449	Our sales rep or whatever from Nintendo deals with only a certain region.
1322489	1324210	Maybe, say, the West Coast or whatever.
1345757	1350821	He doesn't deal with GameStop, which would be the Dallas area.
1351322	1357687	So where his information might be that there are no kiosks, someone else that works for Nintendo
1358337	1361379	Yeah, there are kiosks because they're going to GameStop.
1361500	1362280	So kind of interesting.
1362440	1363401	It makes sense.
1363421	1369526	Because I think about that and I think about trying to put all that together because I don't think the reps that were talking to you were full of BS.
1369606	1373069	I know you're not full of BS despite what other people on the internet might think.
1375290	1377072	It kind of adds up for me that this could be true.
1377472	1389009	and the thing I think the thing the major difficulty with having a GameStop you know kiosk or not a GameStop kiosk but a Wii kiosk is that the controllers don't have a wired version there's no
1389969	1390429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1410439	1412941	The other news that came out actually... I want to ask real quick, though.
1412981	1421027	What about... Now, the thing that makes me think this may not be true is that there was this story earlier about Walmart said that they weren't going to be doing it or whatever.
1421047	1425410	And I'm thinking, well, when was Walmart given an option if it's exclusive to GameStop, right?
1425811	1426031	Well...
1426792	1427172	Who knows?
1427332	1428073	I mean, I don't know.
1428153	1428453	I don't know.
1428513	1429574	So take it with a grain of salt.
1429654	1431315	Maybe, okay, well, let me put it this way.
1431475	1434697	Maybe they weren't the only ones that were going to be exclusive.
1434837	1438440	Maybe it was going to be GameStop and Walmart and maybe a few other retailers.
1438580	1443523	But, you know, the retailers said, hey, we don't want this demo unit because we're afraid that people are going to get hurt.
1443723	1450748	And to be honest, you know, after seeing some of these people try to navigate the self-checkout, yeah, they will get hurt because they're too dumb to figure it out.
1451208	1455711	JeremyTodd1 says in our chat room, they could just tie a wire where the wrist strap goes.
1455751	1456672	That wouldn't be that hard at all.
1457509	1459531	Okay, that's a perfectly good option.
1460011	1464195	And then I could just take my X-Acto knife out of my pocket and cut the wrist strap.
1465616	1470480	Okay, it's not going to be... Steel cable does not exactly cut with... Oh, I see.
1470500	1471481	Take out the wrist.
1471721	1472121	Never mind.
1472161	1473382	I'm thinking this whole other thing.
1473442	1473783	Never mind.
1474223	1482250	Actually, I don't know if that would work either because wrist straps, you know, those little things on them, the string's pretty thin, so I don't know if you'd be able to stick steel cable through.
1482310	1482590	Ah, whatever.
1482630	1484672	Okay, let's just say you were able to stick steel cable on there.
1485052	1486732	Still people are going to throw them at people.
1487313	1490653	We'll just see what freaking happens when it happens.
1490813	1491713	We're a month away.
1491814	1496775	Just because they don't have a kiosk set up, they can set up a kiosk type set up anyways.
1497175	1501816	I mean, who's to say someone can't just bust one of these things open and just create their own.
1502836	1503596	They'll be out there.
1504696	1505496	Whatever.
1505537	1511898	Anyways, there's some other news also that GameStop was going to be the first to be or they're going to be selling the Zune in stores so if you have a
1513328	1517050	A Fascination with the Microsoft Music Player Well, there you go.
1517070	1517891	You can buy it from them.
1518471	1528337	It's kind of interesting, though, because the other mention on this one article was that this is kind of the first time that they've done this, but if I remember correctly, they were actually selling Creative Nomads in their store as well.
1528377	1531559	Maybe not iPods, but they have been selling music playing devices.
1533540	1542926	Now, some of the more unbelievable rumors from the whole GameStop thing, one of them being that the GameStop Wii Kiosk is going to require
1543365	1545266	A credit card to be able to be used.
1545946	1560352	So, you know, I imagine if they're, you know, with this kind of logic here, probably giving them your license or credit card so you don't walk out with the Wii controller, you know, maybe so that, you know, they don't have to, like, strap them down.
1561272	1567815	I don't know why, when I first read this story, I imagined in my mind, like, having to slide your credit card through the Wii demo thing, and I'm like, no way!
1567875	1571837	I would never do that, because they might charge me for something, you know?
1572337	1572477	So...
1573289	1574010	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1601457	1604079	I still do think overall it's probably a BS story.
1604440	1606321	JeremyTodd1 in chat brings up a good point.
1606361	1607142	This can't be true!
1607642	1612647	Nintendo's trying to market to everybody here, so why would they make the kiosk only available to older people who have a credit card?
1612667	1613367	That's a very good point.
1613387	1614468	Or driver's license, yeah.
1614729	1615049	Seriously.
1615870	1616130	I don't know.
1616450	1617111	I don't think so.
1617731	1622435	Another story, though, coming out of the whole GameStop conference thing.
1624177	1625158	They're saying that
1625891	1633476	GameStop store will receive an average of six systems, more for the higher volume stores and less for the dead stores.
1633496	1638000	One of two systems can be given to employees at their store manager's discretion.
1649011	1652112	I don't think so, but that doesn't sound right at all.
1652552	1654873	The rest are going to be given out to store regulars.
1654953	1663917	If a manager feels that he has a customer who is very loyal, shops there often, reserves many things, they may call them and ask them if they want to guarantee one of the remaining four consoles.
1664257	1667778	Apparently all four of the remaining consoles are handed out in this fashion.
1669719	1672800	That doesn't even sound right at all.
1674781	1675181	Yeah, I...
1676559	1678880	Not every GameStop will get the same amount of PS3s, I don't think.
1678900	1679840	It would depend on volume.
1679880	1684023	So that whole, you know, you get four or whatever, no, I don't buy it.
1684063	1685543	That's a crap policy, too.
1685563	1687565	There'd be so much scandal that goes along with that.
1687585	1688565	And they're not going to give... No way.
1688885	1691907	To be honest, they're not going to give them to employees at all.
1692167	1696409	I mean, if they're going to get four or six, you know, they're not going to do it.
1696850	1701292	And I think that kind of goes with other stories that we've had about the reservations.
1701572	1701712	Right.
1702473	1703953	I just want to say real quick, by the way, we had a...
1705439	1712721	issue in our chat room if you're listening live on Sunday where apparently some folks were not able to get in because somehow the limit got set on the chat room.
1712741	1713641	That's been removed.
1714001	1714641	I just took it off.
1714661	1717542	So if you've been trying to join chat and weren't having any luck, try again.
1717562	1719042	You should be able to get in now.
1719382	1720623	It means our chat room is that full, though.
1721903	1722223	Excellent.
1722643	1722983	All right.
1723603	1726404	So no PS3 pre-orders from regulars, huh?
1727184	1727364	Yeah.
1727544	1727784	All right.
1727824	1730165	Well, there might not be any pre-orders from anyone at all.
1731357	1741305	OneUp is speculating this week that at the annual GameStop conference held last Saturday in Dallas, quote, the great thing is there is a lot of demand, said Steve Morgan, president of GameStop, but launch is one day.
1741706	1744308	And really the key to this business is what flows after the launch.
1744368	1745749	We did learn a lesson last year.
1746069	1748992	I think the lesson is caution and optimism at the same time.
1750415	1758780	GameStop's decision not to guarantee your hardware pre-order is by no means carved in stone, but from this point, it seems a pretty sure thing from a strictly business point of view.
1759180	1764964	Last year, GameStop caught some heat after it mistakenly took in more Xbox 360 pre-orders than it had the capacity to fulfill.
1765424	1767245	Certainly, that would be, you know, correct.
1767305	1775030	We all remember people were blaming GameStop when they couldn't get their Xbox 360s, but, you know, people were saying, well, they should have promised them, you know, yeah, it's
1775629	1778991	But certainly they've learned their lesson, it sounds like, and they won't be doing that again anytime soon.
1779832	1784134	But the other thing I heard was that that's not exactly true either.
1784795	1788717	That they are going to be getting some, or they're going to be starting taking pre-orders.
1789257	1791799	Because this is basically the point that they made.
1792239	1792980	Look at Hawaii.
1793180	1796642	Hawaii's been doing pre-orders for the PlayStation 3 and Wii right now.
1797082	1798343	They're testing that thing out.
1798643	1801325	So yes, they are taking pre-orders on it, but...
1802099	1804060	GameStop employees have been told to shut their mouths.
1823438	1828682	Quote, I'm a manager at an EB GameStop location and recently we received this great little scare notice to pass around the store.
1829042	1836687	Basically, it's been sent in response to all the news about the PS3 Wii pre-orders as well as to scare employees off from buying PS3s and selling them online.
1837468	1838669	So, interesting.
1838869	1843652	It was this interesting little cease and desist and you can read the whole thing if you go over to Kotaku and you can click and find the whole thing.
1844373	1851658	But it's basically your typical, you know, we'd like to issue a friendly reminder about the company policy, blah, blah, blah type thing.
1852038	1852158	So,
1852594	1858196	In other words, yeah, stop coming on the internet and blabbing everything because, man, people can't keep their mouth shut when it comes to some of these rumors.
1860136	1860817	That's kind of funny.
1861177	1866138	Well, one of these people that can't keep their mouth shut about rumors or release dates and stuff would be me.
1866639	1873961	And, well, there's lots of good stuff, well, not a whole lot of good stuff, but still some pretty good stuff coming out this week on all the systems.
1874581	1879923	Starting off with the DS, and Rob, apparently I was wrong earlier, Clubhouse Games is coming out this week on the DS.
1879943	1880483	All right.
1880936	1882717	Crash Boom Bang Xbox GameCube Xbox GameCube
1910684	1912746	and all the portable systems as well.
1913667	1914468	Should be pretty cool.
1915309	1920153	If you're a fan of the Family Feud, that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance.
1920193	1922235	Worst game I played at E3, I'm sorry to say.
1922516	1924277	And don't get me wrong, I love the Feud.
1924758	1930984	I love the Richard Dawson days where you make out with all the women on the show, but something is just
1932068	1937972	Not right in the past 20 years now with Family Feud, so... Mortal Kombat Armageddon, also coming out this week.
1938092	1939313	Oh, that's this week.
1940073	1940574	Very cool.
1940814	1951841	Maybe not so much on the Xbox this week, because, I mean, the date we have in our system right now, somehow Midway moved their date just on the Xbox version, so don't be surprised if you don't see it in stores this week.
1952301	1958745	But, you know, it is slated, though, for this week, though, for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, so... But, whatever.
1959065	1959466	Anyways, um...
1960823	1970209	Then, of course, you've got Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox as well as PSP.
1971070	1972811	For the PC, you're getting a few things.
1973051	1980636	Warhammer 4000, Dawn of War, Dark Crusade, Devil May Cry 3, Dante's Awakening Special Edition on the PC.
1981196	1988281	Also, Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf 07, and Dirt, Origin of Species.
1989922	1990202	All right.
1990549	1992090	So that should be pretty good.
1992430	1994450	Next week's going to be lots of good stuff, including Bully.
1995591	1996051	Oh, okay.
1996151	1997451	And you're going to be getting that, I'm sure?
1998252	1999532	I'll be getting it one way or another.
1999672	1999992	All right.
2001113	2001593	Let's see.
2002253	2005954	Next week in Japan, I've got Japanese release dates for you, or I should say this week in Japan.
2006414	2008875	Not a whole lot of pickings for you guys in Japan this week.
2008915	2009816	It's kind of a slow week.
2010396	2016498	MotoGP 2006 is on its way, along with Rockstar Table Tennis making its way in Japan this week.
2016857	2017637	I also forgot one.
2018578	2019038	PlayStation 2.
2019538	2020538	This one is awesome.
2021139	2022659	God Hand is coming out this week.
2023620	2024800	Definitely worth checking out.
2025180	2027601	I'll actually have a review for that next week.
2027981	2031163	That's one of the games I have on my slate to play.
2031983	2037045	Jamie's not here tonight, so sorry to our European listeners, but we're just going to not do your dates tonight.
2038120	2039561	PowerStone Collection on the PSP
2065000	2066462	Not the same magic as the Dreamcast.
2066542	2067182	I can't explain it.
2067302	2068303	It's just not the same magic.
2068363	2071607	But hey, if you're a Power Stone fan, you might get a kick out of this.
2072167	2081296	And then Resident Evil 4 Platinum Edition making its way to the PlayStation 2 along with Wild Arms 4, Steam Bot Chronicles also on the PlayStation 2 this week.
2081496	2087603	If you're a Game Boy Advance player, Rebel Star Tactical Command coming out for the GBA this week in Europe.
2087903	2088243	Have fun.
2088784	2088964	Cool.
2090382	2100213	Some interesting information, which is not, well, I shouldn't say it's too surprising, but Miyamoto's actually come out to say that the Wii is, well, the hardware is basically a GameCube.
2100634	2104558	And, you know, that's kind of like saying a Pentium 4 is basically a Pentium 1.
2105559	2108182	Basically, that it's on the same kind of...
2109502	2110803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2130165	2135306	Well, you know, now the anti-Nintendo fan base, though, is like, you know, oh, you're paying $250 for a controller.
2135366	2136386	Have fun, suckers.
2136786	2139307	And, you know, people are also saying about, you know, Super Smash Bros.
2139347	2141387	I just saw a post in the LiveJournal community this afternoon.
2141407	2142627	It was talking about, you know, Smash Bros.
2143448	2150869	that's coming out on the Wii is not really going to be using the Wii functionality in the main game, which is not much of a surprise.
2150929	2152929	I mean, you know, I kind of wouldn't want it to.
2153329	2155770	But another thing, why don't they just do it on the GameCube then?
2156130	2167775	Well, just because it's... Well, the specs are still upgraded, just because... It's just like saying, you know, a PC nowadays, you know, which is still based on the same architecture as a PC from, like, say, 15 years ago.
2168395	2174318	I mean, granted, they're not the same thing, but they're based off the same architecture, so... So?
2174718	2175378	You know, big deal.
2176299	2177199	Like I say, play the games.
2177319	2178860	If you like the games, great.
2179120	2180180	Who cares about specs?
2180300	2184082	I mean, you know, I don't give a shit of how many USB ports are on this thing.
2184102	2184402	I mean...
2185217	2185877	It does not matter.
2185997	2188318	So just play the games if you like them, great.
2188638	2194321	I mean, after all, Pac-Man wasn't really pushing the graphics or anything, so whatever.
2196702	2197022	Alright.
2197062	2200923	Bandit in our chatroom says, Miyamoto said it himself that the Wii is a souped up GameCube.
2200983	2203244	Certainly a quote a lot of people have been running with this week.
2203284	2204765	I saw that posted on a lot of blogs.
2205585	2206646	But, you know.
2207306	2209987	So, Sony said that the PlayStation 3 is future-proof.
2210007	2212568	It'll cure cancer, so I mean...
2213686	2216471	I don't believe that either, but whatever
2226023	2235452	According to UBS, 2 million Wii consoles were completed in the third quarter, July to September, to support the upcoming fourth quarter launch.
2236072	2242458	In addition, at least 7 million and potentially as high as 9 million more units are in the build plan for the fourth quarter of 2006.
2243299	2249064	This production ramp handily exceeds a publicly announced target for 6 million units to ship by year end.
2249494	2253837	So Nintendo may have been playing it conservative a little bit with their launch numbers, and they may have more.
2254918	2261963	I still think if you want to get this on launch day, you probably are going to be having to do the pre-order or the campout or one of those things.
2262003	2266086	I don't think you're going to be able to walk into the store and pick one up if you didn't do some type of pre-planning.
2266126	2279035	And I mean, it's great that they're going to have that many units, but this thing's on all the Christmas lists, all the different retailers' Christmas lists, and once they launch their marketing campaign for this, it's going to be the hot Christmas item, so yeah.
2279448	2280249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2307649	2309010	But how important is launch day?
2309030	2318753	Because I go back and I think about PlayStation 2 and I think about... I remember seeing the lines on TV and stuff, but I don't remember being so excited about a PlayStation 2 right on launch day.
2319374	2320514	How important is the line?
2320534	2324055	And yet the PlayStation 2 was still the most successful of the last gen.
2324075	2324736	It's just the bragging.
2324976	2326176	It's the e-penis thing.
2326256	2329217	It's basically, I've got the console and you don't.
2329778	2330998	Or I'm playing it first.
2331318	2333139	Everyone's got to be first, so...
2334560	2334900	I don't know.
2335100	2338162	I think what's important is how many units they can sell by the end of the year.
2338342	2345326	Because I think if they're... I mean, right now in the US, I believe they're up to about 3 million Xbox 360 units.
2345467	2348628	Don't count on me on that, but I think that's about where they're at.
2348969	2351370	I think worldwide they're about 6 million.
2352090	2362397	And if they can sell 4 million Wii units in the United States alone, and if they're able to... I'm sure they're going to be able to sell all 9 million units of the Wii.
2362497	2362917	They're going to...
2363818	2364418	and DarkSakura.
2390754	2391735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2407185	2407725	All right, we'll see.
2408646	2413329	Bandit in our chatroom says, Best Buy better not say, oh, you can buy a Wii from us, but only as a package deal.
2413589	2413990	Agreed.
2414350	2414670	They are.
2415751	2416431	I bet you they will.
2416611	2419653	And I will not buy it at Best Buy.
2419793	2422015	Well, I'm going to tell you why they're going to do that, though.
2422135	2425177	The reason why they're going to do that is because there's no margins on this thing.
2425537	2435764	That's one thing I mentioned a couple episodes ago, is that the margins on the Wii system is only a few bucks, and they have to sell it in a bundle to make money off this thing.
2436084	2436645	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2454653	2457113	or whatever and buy it just by itself.
2457273	2462094	But some of these companies are going to want to try to do this and you just don't have to buy from them.
2462294	2465955	Or if you're really desperate to get the system at launch, then yeah, you will buy that.
2466195	2467595	But I don't know.
2467715	2473076	No one's saying anything for sure, but don't be surprised if they do because they've done it in the past with other systems.
2473896	2477917	Anush in our chatroom says, Sky, do you know of any major stores that are doing a midnight release?
2478577	2480278	I imagine most will probably have to.
2482970	2484491	Who did ones for Xbox 360?
2484531	2485792	That's probably who's going to do them for Wii.
2486192	2488914	I mean, you can just kind of go down that list right there.
2489175	2491476	Whoever did them for Xbox 360 is probably going to do them for Wii.
2491817	2496480	I know a lot of GameStops do them for Madden, and those are just games, not even systems.
2496840	2504085	So I would imagine if there's a big GameStop in your area, or EB, any of those types, they will probably be doing a big midnight party.
2505707	2508268	God, does that mean we have to go out and report on a midnight launch?
2508989	2509529	Fuck no.
2509710	2510250	What are we going to do?
2510855	2512196	What have I got to go out there, dude?
2512296	2513176	I'm getting mine early.
2514157	2516478	For the goodness of better journalism.
2517359	2517879	Yeah, okay.
2518479	2524243	Listen, I don't want to be like the news crew, because you know every fucking year they always have some stupid station.
2524663	2528445	Look it, there's people outside waiting in the cold for their new game system.
2528465	2529566	What's this new game system?
2529826	2530366	The why?
2530466	2531107	Why is this?
2531127	2533388	Why must you have the Nintendo Y?
2533868	2534328	It's Wii.
2534589	2535069	Why?
2535209	2538271	Why is it called... It's Wii.
2538371	2538691	Why?
2538711	2538771	Why?
2540485	2549170	I believe I may have actually already committed this program to be working with other podcasters in some type of a wee news live on launch night.
2551471	2551711	Fine.
2551751	2553772	By the way, there's a staff meeting after the show.
2554593	2555533	Way to go, Rob.
2557094	2557494	Loser.
2559250	2564211	One of the games you might be expecting, I'm not sure if at launch, Bionicle Heroes is going to be heading to the Wii.
2564712	2566512	And Bionicle Heroes is going to be pretty good.
2566792	2573754	It's actually done by Traveler's Tale, which I believe is the people behind LEGO Star Wars and the LEGO Star Wars original trilogy games.
2573874	2579556	So, of course, you would imagine, okay, a LEGO's game, Bionicle Heroes, yeah, makes perfect sense.
2580336	2587098	This, of course, information coming from the ESRB website, which seems to be leaking a lot of info on...
2588058	2589639	Upcoming games for the Wii.
2590740	2591501	Look for that soon.
2593942	2594263	Alright.
2595443	2595764	I will.
2595984	2596704	I'll be looking for that.
2597305	2597805	Excellent.
2597885	2604430	A lot of people were bitching about the Wii not having a wired internet port in it.
2604750	2609033	Because, you know, of course it supports the wireless internet, but what if your house isn't wired for wireless?
2610374	2611575	Then you're screwed, right?
2611595	2611695	Right.
2612262	2613403	No, not necessarily.
2613764	2614324	Here's the thing.
2614564	2615185	The dongle.
2615405	2617787	Remember the dongle that you got for the Nintendo DS?
2617807	2618688	You can use that on your Wii.
2619769	2622752	And that was something I'd speculated a while back that you could probably do, so that's pretty cool.
2623393	2624454	So that's something you can do.
2625234	2633883	Also, Nintendo has announced they are going to provide an Ethernet kit so that you can directly connect the console to a standard Internet router.
2633983	2636325	It's going to go from USB to Ethernet.
2636565	2637326	Probably, so...
2638357	2642074	Good job, Nintendo, in squelching that little cry of...
2642842	2644884	I can't imagine those would be too expensive.
2645464	2647005	Well, how much was the other dongle?
2647025	2647005	$30?
2647606	2650068	$35?
2647706	2650068	It's like $25 or something.
2650208	2651169	I'm going to be honest, though.
2651189	2657294	If you're going to be spending that kind of money to get your Wii online, you might want to think about just upgrading to a wireless router for your house.
2657354	2658955	They're not that expensive these days.
2658975	2668363	Yeah, a wireless router, and if you really don't want to spend the money, just spend $25 on the wireless thing, because then that way you can use the Wi-Fi with your DS as well.
2669484	2671125	And with your PSP, I think, so...
2671724	2671984	Why not?
2672385	2673686	El Mullet brings up a good point.
2673986	2675747	You can use the dongle on your Wii.
2675827	2676848	Why doesn't that sound right?
2678669	2679050	I don't know.
2679090	2679430	Good point.
2680170	2681091	It sounds dirty.
2681972	2684213	You know, I wonder what's kind of interesting about that.
2684394	2687936	I wonder if you could use... No, no, you wouldn't be able to use that.
2687956	2694321	I was going to say use the Xbox 360 one, but that's $99, and that plugs in the Ethernet port anyways.
2694781	2695822	Anyway, sorry, I digress.
2696563	2696683	Okay.
2697620	2701843	Now, there's been a lot of, you know, in the past, people cheating in MMOs.
2701883	2710089	You know, basically hiring people to, you know, farm gold for them or to, you know, sell accounts to them that are high level and stuff like that.
2710449	2715413	Well, now they're kind of doing something like that on the Xbox 360 with someone's Gamertag.
2715473	2715873	That's right.
2716013	2722578	Someone actually has their Gamertag and their Xbox 360 hard drive up on eBay for sale.
2723258	2724880	The Gamertag Rants 6 is...
2726060	2750980	Who has, by the looks of it, over 30,000 points on their gamer score From what I understand, this is actually the number one ranked gamer score on my gamer card net I guess so The guy's got 19 bids as of right now As of when Xbox 360 updates reported it They've actually, and the bidding's up to $5,000 already
2753067	2754388	And the reason why the guy's selling it?
2754528	2756170	Well, he's buying a PS3.
2759233	2760053	Very interesting.
2760814	2763096	But why would you buy this just to have the gamer score?
2763416	2769602	You know, this kind of goes along with another story that didn't make our show roll for tonight, but surely a lot of you guys have heard about this.
2769622	2778270	There's that company out there that's offering to inflate your gamer score or earn you 3,000 gamer score points for, what was it, 3,000 points for 200 bucks, something like that?
2779304	2779624	Why?
2780004	2780685	Why would you do that?
2781125	2785348	For about 10 bucks you can do the same thing and even more than that.
2785848	2787749	And why you would even want to spend this kind of money?
2788150	2790151	What do you mean for 10 bucks you can do the same thing?
2790551	2792472	There's ways you can inflate your gamer score.
2792652	2793173	You can cheat.
2794053	2794274	How?
2794774	2795014	How?
2795294	2795654	Saves.
2796255	2796715	Game saves.
2796755	2797636	Transferring game saves.
2797936	2800878	Certain game saves on games will actually unlock achievement points for you.
2801118	2802259	I gotcha.
2802379	2802999	Okay.
2803159	2806921	Or you can actually hack saves to do that as well.
2807382	2807542	But
2808446	2810348	So why you would spend $300 on this?
2811809	2816853	Why would you even give away your personal account to some stranger?
2816893	2817533	It's beyond me.
2817773	2818114	I don't know.
2818174	2819595	But I bet you anything this is what they're doing.
2819615	2822137	They're just $300 for like 10 minutes of work.
2824419	2825720	Oh, whoops, that story wasn't in the show.
2825800	2827421	What was the next thing I was supposed to go over?
2827521	2829102	Oh, well, excellent.
2829122	2830303	We talked about it now.
2830803	2833345	We prepped really hard for tonight's show, ladies and gentlemen.
2834286	2835027	Hooray.
2835047	2835167	Hooray.
2836371	2839053	Well, that's pretty awesome that you mentioned that.
2839133	2841074	Yeah, so let's just keep it moving.
2841514	2853081	Anyways, now, you know, I'm glad that there's people out there actually, you know, concentrating on Xbox Live because, you know, it just wasn't really that annoying yet.
2853762	2858725	And so now there's a brand new device out there for smack talking called Smack Talk.
2859105	2859225	It's $29.99.
2860913	2867476	It's basically a little device that plugs into your headphone port on your Xbox 360 controller.
2868316	2873758	And it allows you to record five different smack talks into the device.
2874198	2879901	So you can push the button at any time to release an automated blah, blah, blah.
2880701	2881801	I pwned you, noob.
2881941	2882822	You know, stuff like that.
2882842	2882922	Yeah.
2884909	2885409	Hooray.
2886090	2886690	That's excellent.
2886710	2894676	Or what most people do is like, you know, take South Park recordings from that World of Warcraft episode, you know, total pwnage, and then put it on the stupid thing.
2894996	2895797	Yeah, so it comes through.
2895837	2900260	You know, because, you know, it's all... You know what's going to be on mine when I get one of these.
2901461	2902541	Draw four, bitch!
2904143	2905163	Just kidding, I'm not getting one.
2907116	2911318	I want to point out some of the chat in our chat room about the whole inflating your gamer score thing.
2911918	2912918	Elmolet has a method.
2913178	2914399	One, sign up with Gamefly.
2914459	2915959	Two, rent four games at a time.
2916240	2917480	Three, play the games.
2917780	2918821	Four, earn mad points.
2919401	2921281	And VXJasonXV agrees with that.
2921341	2922642	Just freaking play.
2923382	2923742	Seriously.
2924303	2928084	And Jeremy Todd 1 wants to ask, Loki, if you could sell your account for $5,000, would you?
2928944	2930805	Sure, because I just started a new one.
2932406	2932946	Who cares?
2933553	2937176	Elmullet would like to share he's almost at 10,000 points through the Gamefly renting method.
2937576	2939218	I think he does have the highest score on my friends list.
2939338	2941260	I just don't have time to play that many games.
2941980	2945904	And I have that many games, too, to play, but I just don't have the time.
2947425	2952249	SSJ wants to know, what are the five pre-programmed things in the Smack Talk device?
2952349	2957774	He says, fag, fuck, bitch, owned, retard are the five that will be pre-programmed.
2957794	2958654	Yay.
2958674	2959275	He said fag.
2959635	2960256	Oh.
2961437	2961757	Anyways.
2964821	2965841	Why, people, why?
2967402	2971223	Well, one of these games you may or may not be smack talking on is NBA Live 07.
2972404	2974444	But I'll tell you where the smack talk's going right now.
2974825	2975405	It's going to EA.
2976630	2977751	Thank you for watching.
2995171	3001813	users leaving Battlefield 2 because they feel the problems will never be addressed, or former FIFA players moving on to Pro Evolution winning XI.
3002273	3003773	It's a sense that we are all sharing.
3004073	3009794	We look at NBA Live over the last few years and we see the same basic game being re-released with new fancy features.
3010615	3014236	You know, it's kind of funny because that's what all the non-sports games fans say about these games.
3014276	3018777	You know, when they don't understand Madden 06, 07, they go, it's just a roster update.
3018917	3020017	It kind of is.
3020057	3021197	Even the fans are admitting it.
3021237	3022698	It's even worse with FIFA.
3022778	3024478	FIFA, they release two games a year.
3025371	3027974	The same elemental problems from the last few years are still there.
3028334	3030516	Some have been tweaked, but the overall issues still exist.
3030816	3036181	While there are plenty of new features, it gives the impression that EA is saying in response to the lingering issues, yeah, well, hey, look at this.
3036641	3040644	Be it an all-star weekend, superstar moves, or dynasty additions.
3040905	3044468	While those additions are nice to have, it is piling on a base that cannot support it.
3044768	3050253	Instead of addressing the underlying fractures, EA is just constructing a new structure on the old crumbling foundation.
3050533	3052575	And on this letter, they put YouTube links.
3053115	3054916	to actual videos of the game being buggy.
3055557	3061780	Very interesting rise up of the fan community against this, especially that part where they say they're all going to go play NBA 2K.
3062200	3064202	That's pretty, that them's fighting words.
3064222	3070866	Well, you gotta talk in numbers because, you know, I would be very interested to see if EA responds to this.
3071646	3071886	At all.
3072727	3073187	Probably not.
3073327	3081752	If they don't, that's, I don't know, I mean, you can probably lose these rabid fans on the internet and still make money on the game, but
3082805	3086566	You need to do something about this free publicity or it's going to go away.
3087106	3088347	Well, you know what?
3088507	3090988	All EA seems to care about nowadays is money anyways.
3091248	3097390	You saw the stories about how they're releasing Madden tutorial videos on how to throw passes and stuff.
3097430	3101391	They're charging on Xbox Live Marketplace for this stuff.
3102071	3104712	It's basically stuff that should have been included in the game in the first place.
3105752	3107833	Now they're charging premium content for this.
3108953	3109433	Fuck them.
3109733	3111734	A lot of responses in our chat room.
3112250	3135300	JeremyTodd1 says, EA's response, blame Canada, not us Deekman says, EA Games is never going to lose money as long as they're publishing Maxis games Joshi16 says, EA will not acknowledge their own faults Blackwolf says, EA's response, you already bought our game, bitches Interesting Yeah, I mean
3136786	3137967	You bought them, so whatever.
3138107	3139688	I would just, you know, wait to play them.
3140108	3140669	Wait to buy them.
3140829	3144692	You know, wait for the reviews to come out so you can find out if it's buggy or not.
3144712	3148955	Because, you know, this year, actually, 2K7 got a way better review than live.
3149055	3150376	So, we'll see.
3151016	3153718	Alright, all this news about buggy games makes me angry.
3153758	3157101	You should release your game with minimal faults.
3157141	3161364	I mean, there's going to be bugs and everything, but minimal faults and not try to patch it all on the back end.
3161544	3164506	Or just not playing patch it all like some companies do.
3165206	3165927	That makes us angry.
3166297	3167097	So you know what that means.
3167297	3169118	It's time for... FU of the Week.
3169138	3169618	You got it.
3179461	3185443	Since Jamie's not here tonight, I will enter an FU to traffic on her behalf because that's her typical FU.
3186323	3188804	Loki, should I be entering an FU to traffic on your behalf as well?
3189604	3189704	Uh...
3190129	3192131	I don't know, I wasn't really driving that much this week.
3192731	3203819	No, I'm going to say FD to stupid people that are trying to use the self-checkout because it actually takes longer for them to self-checkout than it would to check out normally.
3204299	3215107	And I think that's kind of funny sometimes that they put self-checkout machines in these stores that you know people are not smart enough to actually be able to use.
3215147	3216428	Like Walmart, for example.
3216868	3218970	There should not be self-checkout at Walmart because
3219986	3222667	My god, these people don't understand anything other than hunting games.
3222807	3226508	So, please, remove the self-checkout from Walmart.
3226588	3228989	Or, like, block it off, you know, IQ test.
3229449	3230890	You should have a smart card, you know.
3231250	3232330	I'm a smart person.
3232670	3233951	I should be able to use this device.
3234591	3235071	You're dumb.
3235651	3235971	Go away.
3238472	3240413	I have a much lamer FU to enter in tonight.
3240453	3245654	My FU would go to Beatmania 2DX, specifically doubles mode, because it's hard.
3245714	3246675	It's really hard.
3246735	3247715	Like, you know, I can pass...
3248417	3254819	I'm okay at the regular 7 key mode, but, well, actually I've lost a lot of skill because I haven't played a lot regularly, so F you to that.
3255119	3259221	The fact that there's no working Beatmania 2DX arcade machine in town anymore.
3259481	3260821	But I really suck at doubles.
3260981	3264743	I mean, I've been trying to use your controller to play doubles, and I passed, like, some 4s, but that's about it.
3265103	3265563	I suck.
3266183	3272745	It's very humbling to go from being able to pass 7s and some flashing 7s to, like, shit, I can only play 4s now because I'm doing doubles.
3273706	3277807	I can only play 4s and some 4s, not even all of them.
3278849	3279429	I suck at this.
3305996	3312118	but NBA 2K7 will support seven players offline which is pretty interesting.
3313839	3315419	Seven players is kind of an odd number.
3315519	3318700	I would think six players would be good enough since it's three on three.
3318800	3320201	Do any of you have that many friends?
3321021	3321741	I don't have that many friends.
3321801	3326083	I have four controllers and I never play with four friends because no one wants to play.
3326663	3327283	It's so lonely.
3328323	3331684	I'll come over and play but not NBA because I suck at those games.
3331704	3333165	Double dribble for life, man.
3333615	3334135	Double Dribble
3358139	3361200	So new peripherals are coming out for the PlayStation 3.
3361300	3366381	Of course, I can't remember if we mentioned it last week, but the controller's being named the Six Axis.
3367141	3368402	Didn't we talk a little bit about that last week?
3368442	3370142	I can't remember if that was last week or not.
3370462	3376684	But of course, the controller's officially been dubbed the Six Axis, and IGN's posted some very nice little screenshots of all these devices that are coming out.
3377284	3378144	And by the way, have you been to...
3379033	3379814	GameStop recently.
3379874	3386858	I saw some big banner ads for PlayStation 3 and Wii in the store, like kind of placeholding where they're going to put them up on the wall when they get those systems in.
3387358	3390560	You can see a nice big clear picture of the PlayStation 3 controller on there.
3390981	3392161	And then the memory card USB.
3392181	3396384	Well, I don't really need to see a big clear controller picture because I've touched it.
3396544	3396784	Whatever.
3396804	3397365	I'm just saying.
3397805	3398305	I'm just saying.
3398505	3399246	If you want to see one.
3400011	3400691	I like the remote, though.
3400811	3401772	Yeah, the remote's pretty cool.
3401792	3403453	The remote has like 10,000 buttons.
3404273	3406534	It looks like one of those all-in-one style remotes.
3406734	3409115	Looks like the Harmony remote for the 360.
3409155	3412156	I'm still weirded out by the whole Spider-Man font on the PlayStation 3, though.
3412176	3415638	Did you like that remote that they had, the Harmony one made by Logitech?
3415678	3416738	You're like, that remote's $150?
3416838	3418179	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3418219	3419540	I remember seeing that at Best Buy or whatever.
3419560	3423581	I was like, what the... You don't need to spend $150 on a remote unless it will never get lost.
3423881	3425522	But if it's that big, it probably won't ever get lost.
3426242	3427023	Maybe it would be worth it.
3427203	3427463	I don't know.
3427783	3429344	It should be attached to the PS3.
3430225	3441209	Anyways, one thing that Sony's been combating, other than a lot of bad press, is that the PlayStation 3 is overheating and having some sort of a similar problem as the Xbox 360 did.
3441909	3445951	And this is basically coming from Tokyo Game Show, because a lot of the units were overheating.
3446211	3448952	But from what I heard about Tokyo Game Show, that place wasn't air-conditioned.
3449272	3450453	Wouldn't that fucking suck?
3450913	3454994	I mean, it's hot as it is in E3, let alone without AC.
3455915	3457095	Fuck that, I wouldn't go.
3457515	3458376	That's a good deterrent, though.
3458516	3459496	They should do that, turn off the air.
3460103	3463725	Then the place would smell so awful.
3464165	3466566	Oh, it probably does anyways.
3467267	3475831	So, yeah, basically they're having overheating problems at Tokyo Game Show because, you know, the temperature of the building was just so high.
3477172	3486156	What's interesting, though, is I didn't hear about any overheating problems on the 360 or, you know, the Wii's or anything like that from Tokyo Game Show, so I don't know.
3486176	3486997	I guess we'll see at launch.
3487937	3489078	This is why I don't
3489537	3489857	I don't know.
3489977	3492158	I don't know if I want to buy a PlayStation 3 at launch.
3492718	3494439	It's just too much stuff to get wrong.
3495380	3497741	Plus, that thing weighs about 15 pounds from what I heard.
3499601	3504364	I've already decided I'm not getting one at launch because there's nothing coming out at launch I'm interested in playing.
3504524	3505344	Sorry, Sony fans.
3505364	3506745	That's just how I honestly feel about it.
3506845	3508405	There's nothing I really want at launch.
3508425	3509626	It's all about the games for me, you know.
3510066	3513047	Maybe if they had a Twisted Metal or maybe, I don't know.
3513668	3515288	Oh, I don't know, Final Fantasy XIII or something.
3515368	3516689	Final Fantasy XIII would be cool, but
3517096	3517997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3547137	3549459	Oh yeah, I hope that sucks.
3550060	3566835	You know, I wouldn't be surprised if I see the news story for it, but right now I'm going to expect it to come out November 17th, and when it doesn't, I'll just be like, well, that's nothing new, but if they fucking miss this year's Christmas, that ain't good.
3567375	3568516	That's not good at all.
3568536	3571339	They're going to have another Neo Geo on their hands.
3572489	3572849	PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7
3593887	3598389	NBA 2007 is in the video running at 1080p at 60 frames a second.
3598429	3604433	It shows a little bit of the PSP connectivity, some of the photo browser stuff, and the visualizer that goes with the music.
3605914	3611238	Basically think PlayStation Portable interface, that's the PlayStation 3 interface.
3611898	3612999	Well, at least it's consistent.
3613579	3614620	It is, but I mean...
3615717	3622001	I mean, straight down to pop the game in and you have the background change and a little animation icon video or whatever.
3622021	3626483	Yeah, same thing, so not a huge surprise.
3627064	3641872	What is kind of surprising, though, is that the PSP, there's been a lot of, you know, stuff going on in the homebrew community for the PSP, including, and this is very interesting, a brand new device that someone's actually creating called the PSP Touch Me.
3642873	3644474	Which, where did the PSP touch you?
3645014	3645054	Ha!
3646189	3647610	Show me on the doll where it touched you.
3648511	3659818	But it's actually going to be a device that plugs into the USB port and puts kind of a glass screen over the actual screen, and you'll be using a stylus with it as a touchscreen.
3660338	3664921	So it's kind of interesting to see homebrew people come out with this stuff.
3667301	3671203	Thinking of ideas that Sony themselves probably didn't even consider.
3671984	3684851	Yeah, but even if Sony themselves came out tomorrow and said, hey, we're going to sell this touchscreen adapter for the PSP, would it... I mean, because, like you say, the stuff has to be out there for the games to be made for it.
3684891	3691896	So that's why peripherals traditionally have not done very well, because they weren't very well supported on the game front.
3691916	3695918	So why would the PSP release a touchscreen officially if no...
3696641	3698702	I don't think they would anyways.
3700542	3701883	They might be accused of copying.
3701963	3703263	So what the hell can I use this for?
3703683	3707825	Homebrew games, which it's only going to support some homebrew games right now.
3708325	3711566	And it's designed to use as an add-on and it will cost you $56.
3712986	3717968	And no word on when it's going to be released, but it looks pretty cool.
3718768	3719049	I don't know.
3721269	3723410	I'm not buying one, but it's kind of neat.
3724519	3727080	I think it's neat that the community came together and built that.
3727120	3728660	I think that's the neatest part of it for me.
3728680	3733361	Well, just like they built a GPS device for this thing already, so... Isn't there an official one now?
3733821	3735422	There is an official GPS device.
3735482	3736482	It's coming out later this year.
3736522	3742603	So could that happen where Sony decides to make an official one, or would they not do that out of fear of being called Nintendo copiers?
3743523	3746724	I don't think they would... I don't think they... I think they think it's gimmicky.
3747444	3750125	But then again, you know, they did do the eye toy, so... I don't know.
3750999	3753340	But I mean, look at some of the cool stuff Homebrew is doing.
3754540	3759882	They released a custom firmware this week also, a 2.71 firmware that runs Homebrew games.
3760882	3766944	So you can run your current games right now for the PSP and Homebrew without any modification.
3766964	3778888	The only thing is you can't upgrade using an official upgrader that comes out later on, but you can always downgrade it back to 1.5 and then upgrade again if you really wanted to, but
3779534	3780094	I mean, come on.
3780514	3784755	They've broken every firmware that they come out with, so that's pretty awesome, though.
3785476	3785736	All right.
3787096	3790157	That's going to start to bring this segment to a close.
3790597	3792758	We're going to get into the DDR previews first.
3793658	3800960	We have been premiering over the past several weeks some new tracks from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4 coming out for the Xbox very soon.
3801260	3802140	Later this month, right?
3802360	3803040	Is the last we heard.
3803561	3803801	Yeah.
3803981	3804281	Don't know.
3804301	3805681	Wait, what?
3806341	3806921	Ultramix 4.
3807302	3807862	Oh, no, no.
3807902	3808402	That's in...
3809377	3809877	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3832441	3837324	and I'm going to say this is kind of preliminary right now because I don't... This is not coming to us from official sources.
3837844	3841106	This news that Loki's about to give is not from an official source.
3841166	3842627	It's from his distribution channels.
3842787	3843568	Yes, exactly.
3844268	3855614	Universe, $49.99 for the game by itself, $79.99 for the game plus a pad, which I don't understand why they would do a by-the-self version of the game seeing as there's no pad for the 360 yet, so...
3857714	3858014	I don't know.
3858054	3860375	But hypothetically, the pad's going to have to be USB, right?
3860415	3869160	It is USB, so I don't know if it supports... So does that mean if I happen to own a red octane pad that had the USB for my Stepmania, then I could use that on the 360?
3869760	3870120	Maybe.
3870460	3870720	Maybe.
3871141	3871481	Maybe.
3871561	3877484	So it's... Well, I mean, is it going to show into your system as two different games that there are not two different games?
3878004	3879285	Well, it might not know.
3879465	3881726	It depends on how it maps out, because...
3882284	3892447	You know, that's compatible with a PC, you know, where you can map the keys for a USB controller, but you can't just plug in a USB controller into the 360 and it'll automatically work.
3893107	3895588	So, whether it supports it or not.
3895888	3900010	Alright, we'll take it with a little bit of a grain of salt, but those look to be the preliminary prices for the game.
3900030	3901890	Yeah, it's just like Beatmania for the US.
3901910	3906632	Remember how we announced originally that it had two SKUs, one without the controller and one with the controller?
3906652	3907312	Oh, that's true, that's true.
3908462	3908722	DDR ULTRAMIX 4
3928570	3933012	and our good buddy MiniHead also does songs under the name Monolithic.
3933072	3934753	In fact, I believe that was the first name he was using.
3935093	3938915	And we call him our good buddy because he actually does the intro to our show here at Orange Lounge Radio.
3938935	3943096	If you ever wondered where that little ditty at the beginning of our program came from, that was actually written by him.
3943336	3950259	Well, he has a song that's going to be in DDR Ultramix 4 and it's called Arms, the Alpha Omega Extended Mix.
3950299	3953921	We're going to play it for you right now on the DDR Sneak Peeks, Orange Lounge Radio.
3958168	3958554	Thank you.
4231790	4232662	Thank you for watching!
4266226	4273895	That's our buddy MidiHead making an original piece there under the name Monolithic with Arms, the Alpha Omega mix.
4273955	4275216	And of course, that was the long mix.
4275236	4277158	I think I forgot to say that before we started playing it.
4277819	4281383	That is coming to DDR Ultra Mix 4 a little later this year.
4281723	4284306	All right, let's go into some of the DDR cuts now.
4284386	4287530	And the first song is going to be from DDR Universe.
4288290	4289110	Coibito
4328436	4331117	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4363932	4364813	Thank you for watching.
4364853	4365613	See you next time.
4408001	4414244	Orange Lounge Radio bringing you that premiere there of Coibito from DDR Universe.
4414624	4416545	That is Togo Project featuring Sana.
4417045	4420187	All right, let's go into another song from DDR Ultramix 4.
4420387	4429391	It's by a group called Dirty Hertz, and it features Renna Jones, and the song is called Snake Charmer, and it's coming to DDR Ultramix 4 here on the Sneak Peeks.
4489241	4490165	Thanks for watching!
4527042	4529226	SnakeCharmer on Orange Lounge Radio
4539815	4547602	because this song was actually in the trailer for DDR Universe and we can confirm it is in the game, which you probably would have figured out.
4548142	4549163	We'd also tell you the name of it.
4549223	4553106	It's called Treble, Bass, and Attitude and it's by a group called The Acolyte.
4553406	4557550	So here it is on the DDR Sneak Peeks on DDR Universe, Treble, Bass, and Attitude.
4647008	4648429	from DDR Universe.
4648509	4651471	That is Treble Basin Attitude by The Acolyte.
4652292	4652712	All right.
4652752	4653653	That's a... Hold on.
4653673	4657816	I got to put my glow sticks away because that was a little bit of a raving song there or something.
4658457	4660378	It seems like folks in the chat room agree there.
4660398	4661319	I'm looking there.
4662640	4663301	Usyagi.
4663701	4663941	I'm sorry.
4664261	4665843	I probably totally mispronounced that name.
4666263	4670506	Usyagi says, I see myself hyped up on candy and energy drinks playing that song.
4670686	4671027	I agree.
4671447	4674149	That's definitely the mood I'm going to have to be in to play that song.
4674434	4675154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4697020	4702023	10 minutes before we went live tonight, we were like, shit, we were going to talk about this and totally left it off the show roll.
4702103	4702363	Oops.
4702644	4705205	But this is some pretty big news a lot of people were talking about this week.
4705245	4706506	So, Loki, what's this all about?
4706626	4717012	Well, it's been officially announced, as we talked about a while ago when Kotaku leaked it, I guess, about the Burger King games coming to a store near you.
4717372	4718613	And there's going to be three games.
4719053	4726137	There's one called Big Bumpin', which is going to be kind of like a Mario Kart racing game with bumper cars.
4726693	4739702	Pocket Bike Racer, which is also another racing game, and Sneak King, which is going to be basically kind of a stealthy game where you're supposed to be delivering burgers to hungry people.
4740282	4741863	And it's very interesting.
4741883	4751329	The games are going to retail for about $3.99 each, and actually they will be working on both the 360 and the Xbox.
4752010	4755372	And the 360 version, each one's going to have 200 achievement points.
4756006	4757055	So that's pretty cool.
4757418	4757962	And, um...
4758979	4765404	Yeah, granted, this is like consumer whoring to the max, but... But that Sneak King game looks awesome!
4765464	4772449	I can't help but want to buy these, and yeah... The price is right, so what if it's corporate whore lease sponsored out?
4772489	4777533	If the games are fun, I guess that's what... I think this Sneak King could turn out to be a really cult classic.
4777693	4779214	Well, I don't know if I get the game.
4779274	4783738	I mean, it could just be... It could be a good concept that ends up getting horribly executed.
4783758	4784258	We'll see.
4784458	4786740	The whole appeal of Sneak King is the fact that
4787310	4788231	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4812759	4815620	Whatever, I mean, so it's very interesting.
4815700	4821802	And yeah, 200 achievement points per game, so that's pretty cool if you want to whore up your achievement points.
4822502	4827304	Why didn't they release these on Xbox Live Arcade is what I don't understand.
4827624	4828144	I don't know either.
4828524	4832545	Bandit says, oh god, it's MC Kids all over again.
4833266	4837027	Certainly not the first corporately sponsored game we've seen.
4837127	4837847	Yeah, yeah.
4838439	4839800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4861480	4862381	Just before we did.
4862841	4867424	And Kotaku is reporting that the Wii could be launching early?
4867904	4872287	Now, the interesting thing is what they're showing are these screenshots from Best Buys.
4872987	4875869	Not their site, but I guess their internal computer system.
4876430	4881113	And they've looked up the Sony PlayStation 3 in there, and sure enough it shows that November 17th is the street date.
4881513	4887216	But they've looked up the Wii, and the Wii shows an in-stock date of October 29th.
4888815	4894239	So, why would they have that in their system as coming in on October 29th if something wasn't fishy?
4895060	4896621	I don't know, that seems a little interesting.
4896741	4900905	They could be getting the units early, you know, because they're going to have, you know, a lot of them.
4902666	4906969	Interesting enough, though, October 29th is a Sunday, and Nintendo Lake is launching on a Sunday.
4907390	4908571	I still think it's full of BS.
4908751	4914035	I don't think there's any way, not after all this campaign and everything, I know it's wishful thinking...
4914380	4914880	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4939841	4941603	I'll be getting it fucking early, and that's awesome.
4941983	4942444	You hope.
4942924	4944286	I hope, yeah.
4944366	4948190	I did have a few other things I wanted to mention real quick before we end this segment.
4948210	4948370	Sure.
4949151	4950232	Some stuff I forgot to mention.
4950252	4951994	The under-the-radar type of stuff.
4952995	4957280	As mentioned earlier, we talked about DDR Universe, the price of it, $49.99 for the game, only $79.99 for the bundle.
4957300	4958701	Game's supposed to be coming out December 5th.
4961843	4963244	That's the date as it is right now.
4963264	4967406	Of course, dates keep moving around for November and December, so I wouldn't be surprised if it moves.
4968247	4975631	Some interesting stuff, though, talking about the PlayStation 3 launch games, and I think we might have a story later on that kind of covers some of this, too.
4976211	4980293	Koei, their games are actually delayed now because their dev units got to them late.
4981554	4985997	Both Fatal Inertia and Bladestorm are going to be coming out now February 16th.
4987479	4990301	and Super Swing Golf or Super Swing Golf Penga, I believe it's called in Japan.
5016530	5032283	I'll be also coming out on the 13th and we mentioned earlier I think on an earlier podcast about the Activision Wii games being $59.99 well finally someone tuned them in to the fact that no games for the Wii are $59.99 so they've dropped them all down to $49.99 which is excellent
5034366	5040127	If you're looking to save some money on some 360 games, Rumble Roses XX just dropped down to $39.99.
5040287	5044968	Same with MLB 2K6 on the Xbox 360.
5045048	5049629	It's also dropped on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the PSP quite a bit.
5050669	5053849	The Gradius Collection on the PSP has dropped to $19.99.
5054229	5057870	Game Boy Micro has dropped to $79.99, because I guess those things aren't selling.
5058410	5059890	And Dreamfall dropped down to $29.99.
5059930	5060370	So, very cool.
5060410	5060670	All right.
5064451	5068192	And that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
5068312	5070392	But fear not, the show is not yet over.
5070812	5077254	If you're listening on the podcast, you get a new segment of Orange Lounge Radio a little bit later in the week on Wednesday or so.
5077274	5088296	If you're listening to us live, though, whether it be here on Sunday nights when we tape on OrangeLoungeRadio.com or to our rebroadcast on All Games Radio Monday night and Tuesday morning, you only have to wait about 10 minutes.
5089276	5091657	So we'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
5092602	5097573	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
5098034	5102364	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
