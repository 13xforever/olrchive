We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

you in two parts and if you want to hear all the news we already talked about, youíve

00:36.160 --> 00:40.160
got to go to part A. If youíre thinking like, ìHey, why doesnít this podcast talk about

00:40.160 --> 00:43.280
this?î Well, maybe we already did or maybe we missed something and you want to email

00:43.280 --> 00:44.600
us and yell at us about it.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.160
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.740
We love getting emails from you guys.

00:47.740 --> 00:51.320
We got a whole crap load of them this week because we had a long period there with the

00:51.320 --> 00:52.800
pre-taping of our show last week.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.120
Bob is obviously not speaking for me.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.120
What?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.120
What?

00:57.120 --> 00:59.120
We enjoy getting emails from you guys.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.120
Oh, no, I love getting emails.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.120
Thatís it.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.120
Bob is obviously not speaking for me.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
Oh, you know what I mean.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
I go in there too.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
I peek.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
I peek around.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Iím joking.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.120
I like getting email.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.400
Usually youíll share them with me anyway if theyíre really good or really bad.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.120
I love the hate mail though.

01:13.120 --> 01:19.120
I finally just told somebody off in the email and he was so retarded that his only response

01:19.120 --> 01:20.120
was yawn.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.620
Iím like, ìHaha, pwned.î Iím sure that person is still listening and just got a boner

01:24.620 --> 01:25.620
hearing you say that.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.620
Good.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.620
Iím joking because I think that your hate mail is hilarious and really stupid.

01:29.620 --> 01:33.080
So send your hate mail to mailbag at orangealmsradio.com so Dark Star Kara can make fun of it.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.080
Weíll get to that a little later.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.080
Weíll get to the mailbag a little later.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.560
But for now, we need some news.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.320
Loki, save us from this endless debate about hate mail.

01:40.320 --> 01:48.600
Well, Toys ë Us did their wonderful pre-orders for Playstation 3 and the Wii on the 29th.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.920
So that already happened if youíre probably listening to us now.

01:51.920 --> 01:58.880
And yeah, it was a clusterfuck, much like the Gamestop EB pre-orders.

01:58.880 --> 02:05.480
They actually were having lines of people lining up a day in advance.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.280
So pretty crazy.

02:07.280 --> 02:12.480
A lot of the Toys ë Us stores were getting anywhere from like, what was it, I think it

02:12.480 --> 02:26.240
was four to eight Playstation 3s and like sixÖ
