Tonight, October 15th, 2006.
More details on the E3 makeover.
PlayStation 3 and Wii's are pre-ordered around the nation.
And what are the annoying things about the next game generation?
Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that internet radio program.
DarkSakura.com
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
You were... I remember now, so... And then I fell into a coma for eight hours because I have a sinus infection.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So sick Jamie's back.
Those folks that have been listening to the podcast for a long time know that Jamie was sick for a while.
Yeah, and it started from a sinus infection.
So my doctors are like, okay, pick your antibiotic.
I'm like, I get to choose?
So I'm on erythromycin, which hates my whole digestive system.
I prefer C-Pro, just five tablets, but that's just me.
Anyway, sorry, we're not the drug show.
We're Orange Lounge Radio.
Aren't we, Loki?
Techmaster Loki is also here.
Yes.
Yes, how you doing?
Yes, we're not the drug show.
I like your shirt.
You have a Me and Mike Katamari shirt on.
Yes.
You know, I never played that on PSP.
I just kind of missed it.
I was looking forward to it, and then I was kind of like, eh.
I played it a little bit and got bored.
Did you?
Really quick.
Was it just not the same on the little screen?
The lack of a second analog stick.
Cramps my hand up very badly.
And so it was just like kind of Metroid Prime Hunter Syndrome where, you know, you just have to stop playing because it hurts your hand and it's just not, I don't know, it's like trying to control a car with a brick or something instead of a steering wheel.
I don't know.
I actually got the urge to play Katamari Damacy yesterday.
I was lying on the couch kind of just, you know, having one of those lazy days where I'm like, I'm not going to move from this spot.
And then I'm looking over at my game collection, which is, you know, kind of next to the TV, and then I'm like,
I want to roll over things.
I want to play Katamari Damacy.
There's something very stress relieving about that game.
I can't explain it.
We get that feeling every day during work.
That's why we have to have our killing breaks.
I see.
Hence the Liberty City stories.
Yes.
We'll get to your gaming week in just a minute, but I do want to introduce an old favorite of ours that's sitting here tonight on the ground hacking something on the computer over there.
Say hello to Miklatov.
Don't say train.
What's wrong with trains?
Because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My Michelle rocks, just for the record.
Yeah.
No!
And I made myself an Xbox Live account, and so I have my own gamertag now.
After all this time, you finally made your own damn account.
Because of the PSU demo.
Yeah.
Which I haven't played yet, I just downloaded it.
Okay.
But for anyone who wants to know, oh my god, I'm going to regret this.
Just go to the forums and look it up.
Yeah, go to the forums and look it up, because I posted it on the gamertag.
See, then it's free advertisement for the forums.
and then this doesn't have to do with anything about well actually playing a game but it made me think of it since you guys were talking about Katamari is I had a dream on like Thursday night that I was rolling a Katamari over my work you remember the last time I had dreams about that right?
I left that job really?
to another one makes me think of that ad that was on I think it was for like a bank or a credit card or something that showed the Katamari rolling down the hills of San Francisco I mean it
The ad agency denied it was inspired by Katamari, but that's what any gamer would think about when they see that commercial.
It's just, oh, haha, Katamari.
Actually, I still have the parody that I made from when I worked at the student loan place, so I'll post it up in the chat room.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was okay.
What did I play?
I didn't play a whole lot.
More Saints Row, because that game is really fun.
I finally...
I finally stole a Titan, which is an armored car with money in it, and I have been performing the wonderful money duping glitch that's in the game, where you can basically blow this car up over and over, collecting the money in it, and buying it over again.
Fun stuff.
Grand Theft Auto, of course, Liberty City Stories, still waiting for Vice City Stories, only a few more weeks, a few more weeks, then we can switch games, finally.
And then...
Other than that, really not a whole lot.
I was meaning to set up my PlayStation 2 and play some games on that, but I need to buy a VGA cable for it so I can hook it up to my computer because unfortunately Nelly wants to hog the TV with Zuma.
But she's not a gamer.
No, not at all.
She's a single gamer, I guess.
So yeah, unfortunately I can't really play the games on there, so I have to wait for that.
Plus I'm also packing because I'm moving next week, so...
That kind of puts a damper on playing games and stuff.
But I did play a little bit of Dig Dug, which is kind of neat because that came out this week.
I don't know.
It's just Dig Dug.
I mean, what do you expect?
And then tried a little bit more of Need for Speed Carbon.
The demo is pretty awesome, actually.
I'm pretty impressed with it so far.
So you may need to check that out once the game finally makes its way out here.
Um, then of course, I know there's some, I tried playing the multiplayer demo of Splinter Cell, uh, Double Agent, but unfortunately at the time I was torrenting a bunch of stuff and Xbox Live didn't like that too much.
So, I'll have to try that next week.
I think that's about all I played, yeah.
All right.
My gaming week, a lot of the old standbys.
I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, a little more progress in Enchanted Arms.
New stuff I checked out this week, though.
I downloaded Dig Dug when it came out on Wednesday.
Out of the old Namco classics that have been released recently, Pac-Man and Galaga,
DiggDugg
So, you know, it was cool.
It was kind of, you know, a little bit of memories.
I have to admit, though, I'm a little bit disappointed, as I'm sure most Xbox fans are feeling, is that it seems like we just had nothing but a barrage over the past couple months of rehashed old classic games, and we're really looking forward to some of the new stuff, you know, Luminous.
Castle Crashers, and all this other stuff that's supposed to be coming out.
And I believe I heard somewhere that Xbox has their stuff.
I want to say when we did the story last week about Duke Nukem, and the possibilities of that coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, that they had said that Xbox Live has its calendar full through the end of the year, or something like that.
And it's kind of like, why aren't we seeing releases every week then?
Or why aren't we seeing more homegrown stuff?
Why can't they do releases more than one game a week?
Is that so difficult?
I mean, seriously.
I don't know.
But yeah, so, you know, Dig Dug, yay.
Another classic game, not so yay.
But for the value of $5, can't really complain.
It's, you know, got really easy achievements if you're into hoarding up the achievements.
And unfortunately, no multiplayer or any of that stuff.
But, you know, it's Dig Dug.
Either you remember it from your childhood and you love it, or you'll download the demo and think, oh, another 1980s game that I may or may not buy, depending on
How much nostalgia means to me.
Going from something very nostalgic to something very new, it's kind of nostalgic in a way.
I also played Mortal Kombat Armageddon on PlayStation 2, which is, you know, the clusterfuck Mortal Kombat, so to speak.
It's, you know, every single character was ever in a Mortal Kombat game except for like one obscure, you know, you don't even remember this chick.
But like most, every single character's in it, yeah?
Yeah.
Did you try the Mario Kart type game?
I did.
The Motor Combat or whatever it's called.
It's cheesy.
I mean, don't expect... It's not a racing game, okay?
Mortal Kombat Armageddon was not designed to be a racing game.
It's definitely something extra they tacked on.
It's cute, it's fun, but it'll get old fast.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, the last one technically was Shell and Monks, so that wasn't really a Mortal Kombat game.
No, no, not that one.
The one before it.
Deception.
Deception, yeah.
I actually think I kind of preferred that one.
So what if it didn't have the big cluster of characters?
It had enough to keep the game fresh and moving.
But if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, this is definitely fan service.
I would say the other disappointing thing about this game is I'm kind of surprised it's not next-gen.
I think if they went next-gen with it, then maybe they could have squeezed all that stuff into it.
Of course, it probably would have been in development for another year, but, you know, I don't know.
They're probably working on one.
It's not bad.
For a fighting game, you know, considering the amount of variety you get with this game, you know, it's actually pretty good.
It's just, I don't know, it's a fighting game itself.
I feel a game like...
Soul Calibur 2 or 3 even is much more intricate in the fighting styles, whereas this is just variety, fan service, you know, just throwing tons of different things at you.
So, take it as you will.
And then that's about it.
One other thing, but we'll get to that later.
So I'll ask Miklatov, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was pretty good, shockingly, since I'm not only playing Final Fantasy XI anymore.
This week I played a good amount of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Luminous Live on Xbox Live.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
How come the rest of us haven't gotten a chance to play that?
Because you guys don't use Microsoft's network.
Oh, I see.
You're special.
I'm special.
And I had a great time with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
Luminous Live, not so much.
The 360 controller really, really, really sucks for that game.
I also picked up
Three new games this week.
I picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and that's kind of boring, but it got me through the Wii pre-order line on Friday.
I also picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner, and that's a really, really neat game.
I'm not too far in it.
And I picked up Mortal Kombat Armageddon.
And I think it's a decent game, but they screwed up Rain and he was my favorite character.
So I was not too happy about that.
Other than that, haven't really played much else, I guess, except for what we'll be talking about later.
So that's about it.
Um, other questions in chat room, uh, the always present extra guest on our show, orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat.
Jeremy Todd 1 asks, Miklatov, so you're saying the shitty 360 controllers D-pad works good for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3?
Actually, yeah, because you can perform the rolling moves, like, you know, down to forward and stuff like that, really easily.
Um, so, yeah, I would say it works pretty well for Mortal Kombat, uh, 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, rather.
Street Fighter 2
There was another comment in chatroom, Blaze said, Sky, the original Mortal Kombat never had the variety, it's a true throwback.
Yeah, I guess, but you know, your expectation level of fighting games was different back then.
But then again, come to think of it, that was kind of one of Mortal Kombat's weaknesses in the beginning.
I mean, yeah, it had fatalities, but the first one, as great of a game as it is, it is a little clunky.
Especially on the Genesis.
How would you like to create a fatality mode in that?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The only problem with that is that once you've gone through that, there actually isn't this level of variety that you'd think.
I think it was a lot cooler when everybody had their own unique thing they did.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No one found me.
Well, it's a big place.
But I'm going to be at YowieCon next weekend.
And I will be cosplaying as an Organization 13 member.
So you will see me.
Nerd!
And Chris and Megzy are doing it too.
Nerds!
I know, but we're cute nerds.
So we are going to be in the big trench coats with stuff.
If you find me...
Then you will get a CD sampler.
Some CDs from a different drum.
Yeah.
Yeah, we have little three-inch singles.
Rain Dancer with Come With Me and Rupesh Kartel, Death With Soft Names.
But one of the B-sides on that single is Yours To Command, which is one of the new Ditter songs that we premiered earlier on in the DDR preview segment.
So if you find me, if I'm not completely fawning over, you know, the...
Yowie Action, then you get a present.
I was going to say the Mangina.
But I will also make this disclaimer.
I'm going to be seeing Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D at the Metreon on Friday night.
And I will extend it there.
If somebody recognizes me, you get the CD.
All right.
If not at YowieCon, then at the Metreon.
I worry maybe I should give you some more because there might be a lot of our listeners at YowieCon.
We'll see.
First three people.
How's that?
Alright, we got a lot of these.
We got a lot of these, so there you go.
Two of them are for YaoiCon, one is for Nightmare Before Christmas.
There you go.
Right there, three pairs to give away.
Have fun.
Alright, so go find DarkSakura at YaoiCon.
Huh?
Oh, you... I thought... Oh, never mind.
Rob can't count!
I thought she already had one.
That's alright.
She wants to keep one for herself.
I see how it is.
That's fine.
I actually forgot that I already had one, but I will.
That's all right.
Have fun.
Give those singles away.
I will be traveling as well this weekend.
This is the weekend where I'm finally going to New York City.
Yes, I missed digital life by one whole week because I'm just cool like that.
I will be in New York City this weekend, and I took some listeners' advice and scheduled a time to be at the Nintendo World Store.
Now, here's the thing.
I haven't exactly cleared it with them or anything, and I'm not expecting a swarm of people.
We don't exactly have that many people that listen to the program.
But I will be there Saturday at noon, so come look for me at the Nintendo World Store.
And you know what?
I'll take some CDs, too, so they can come find me.
So it's a West Coast, East Coast thing.
You can come find Jamie on the West Coast, and you can come find me on the East Coast.
So he can find more.
Exactly.
So that'll be Saturday at noon at the Nintendo World Store.
I will be there.
And Loki you can find on his couch all weekend long.
I'll be on my couch at my house.
Probably getting some.
Yeah, probably.
But I will have a CD in case you find me.
Just in case.
Mikotov, will you be anywhere for the fans to meet?
Actually, no one knows what you look like anyway.
Yeah, they don't.
I'll be at work, probably.
So if you find me at work...
I'll give you a high five, because I don't have CDs.
Alright, sounds good.
Actually, I should, because the picture on the form is sort of outdated.
My hair is dyed red now with black streaks in the front, so it will probably be straight, not curly.
Yeah, you look a little different than you do in the album art that you see on iTunes, because that picture is like six months old.
More than that, we did those pictures last winter.
Wow.
It's time for new pictures.
We need new ones.
New ones.
All right.
If anyone looks at my DeviantArt account on my Deviant tag, that's what my hair looks like.
All right.
So come find us.
New York City, Saturday, YaliCon, Metreon, all weekend long.
Orange Launch Radio invades coast to coast.
DDR previews a little bit later on in this segment.
Two new songs from Ultramix 4 and two new songs from DDR Universe.
Tonight.
But first, some gaming news.
Yes.
Lots of gaming news.
And of course, like every year, we were looking forward to E3.
The key word is were.
Unfortunately, E3, as announced earlier this year, has been downsized.
Unfortunately, we won't be able to see this wonderful giant expo with 60,000 plus people in it and
Well, anyways, here's the details on what's going to be happening with this.
It's now being called the E3 Media and Business Summit.
It will take place between July 11th and the 13th in Santa Monica, California.
And they're actually going to be taking up several hotels as well as the large Barker Hangar, which is going to be kind of a show floor type thing.
I don't know.
I guess a place that they can use to demonstrate stuff.
and it's going to be invite only and basically according to Doug Lowenstein this is kind of how he's summing up the whole E3.
E3 is not a place where a product is sold anymore.
The industry is recognized as a big part of mainstream culture so the need for a big glittering event to validate the industry is not what it used to be.
What is needed is to focus on the fact that E3 is going to be much more
about media-related opportunities.
The question is, what is the most efficient way to create those opportunities?
Here's my question to Doug Lewenstein there.
When you say media, do you mean media or the people that have TV shows and giant multi-million dollar websites?
Because talking with some of the other publishers out there, that seems to be the case.
They just kind of want to ignore the smaller guys.
So,
Just remember that the smaller guys do have a reach out there in the marketplace and do contact your customers.
So take that in mind when you're picking those select thousands of people that are going to be at this event.
So that whole thing where he says there's no need for E3 to be the glittering event it once was, he's basically saying, Paris Hilton, stay home!
Keep your skanky ass at home with your dumb little dog and get the hell away from my show.
And to that I say amen.
Well, I understand because there are a lot of people there and it's hard to conduct business.
But at the same time, it's good to have the publicity for your games, especially the smaller companies.
They want people noticing their game there because then it gets covered and then the word spreads about it.
And I think
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
at a recent media event.
Big Boy saying that's essentially what they did is they copy-pasted from the press release.
So if that's what you want, you know, why bother throwing a show?
Just fucking email E3.
Just put E3 in a zip file and send it to their email.
Web conference.
Not in a conference room with those intercom things.
I don't know.
I'm just worried, personally, I'm worried we're not going to be invited.
That's my only worry.
Because, you know, and it would be very disappointing to me because I really do care about, you know,
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Scott over at All Games and the folks at Arena Interactive Lounge where we broadcast they're probably having a fucking field day at this news they're probably so excited but I also think and I'm not insinuating anything I don't know shit about what they're doing next year but just knowing the type of guy that Scott is
Outpost is where it's at next year.
I miss my yearly playing of Xtango.
Poor Xtango.
Hey, yeah, Scott, if you're listening, get the Xtango folks at Arena.
Tell them to give me a copy.
So we can ask them if their game's ever going to freaking come out.
It'll be nice.
It's going to be part of the brand new Duke Nukem Forever.
Coming out on the Phantom.
Anyway.
Speaking of games that we've been waiting for, the demo for Phantasy Star Universe on Xbox 360 is out.
Today being Sunday for us.
It is the last day that you can download it.
I think it was down midnight on Saturday.
Well, whatever.
By the time the people who download this show hear it, it's too late.
Either way, it sucked.
Well, at any rate, I haven't played mine yet.
I did download it yesterday, which is why I made my whole Gamertag account and everything.
But it will be up for play until Wednesday midnight.
So that's the only time you're going to get to.
Of course, it's already been in Japan forever, and I already know someone who has it on PC.
But you know what's really pissy, though, about the Japanese release is that your CDs are all coded much like the...
and DarkSakura.
Once the actual release is out, it will be $9.99 a month for our European listeners.
That's $6.99 pounds.
And they're saying that it will be available for your license, or they're calling it Guardian License, will be available for purchase beginning the 24th of November on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.
Luckily, all the achievements are offline, so I can just rent this thing, which is excellent.
Whore.
And note the other best part about that beta demo.
It's Tuesday that Xbox Live is going to be down the whole day.
So you actually only get about two days to play that.
Thank you, Sega.
Yeah, that's right.
Xbox Live is going to be down Tuesday.
So whoops.
Whoopsie-daisy.
Forgot to plan for that.
Oh well.
Well, at any rate.
It's already out on PC in Japan and that hasn't stopped people.
There is someone who is on one of the big Phantasy Star sites.
Again, I'm not going to list names publicly.
Has made a loading tool for this to bypass the online registration.
You cannot play it online, but you can play it in single player mode if you want to try out the PC version.
Just look around.
It's out there.
I actually got to play the PSU demo.
or Beta, whatever you want to call it.
Now, the thing is, though, it's kind of hard for me to base my judgment off of Beta because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What I did get to play, the only problem I had with it is the tutorial was a little bit clunky and would freeze up, so it was easier to bypass it.
But if you bypass the tutorial, then you kind of don't know what you're doing in the game because just enough has changed from Phantasy Star Online.
But finally, once I figured it out and got in there, it was kind of fun, and I played with a stranger through one level, and it ran pretty well.
and I gotta say, some of the sceneries are really nice.
Like, if you figure out, once you go to the, for those that are playing the beta, go up to the fourth floor, go out the left side, and then you can transport to different planets, and you can transport to this greenish planet that has like a very, like, um...
and so on.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The one thing that I sort of hope is that, you know, since we've done this massive download, it would be nice, though, that for the folks that actually have gone into the effort of downloading the game, that we could just play off the downloaded version, but maybe there could be, like, a quick mode or something that they actually use the demo version for.
Oh, I see.
Well, they already said you're not going to be able to transfer your character you made in the beta over, so... Yeah, that's ridiculous.
Oh, well.
Mikotov, what do you think?
You spent a lot of time playing this.
I really like it.
I have a few really glaring issues with it though So I play as a force on Phantasy Star Online because they're the best And in this game, from what I can tell so far Is that the only way I can do magic is if I equip it to a weapon So I'm going to have to carry multiple weapons Or maybe, I don't know I'm talking as loud as I can
I have to equip multiple weapons so I can have different magic spells and that's going to really make me angry.
And I like that Sega's crazy word filtering stuff still happens.
Like somebody had to use periods to cuss at me today and it was pretty funny.
Why were they cussing at you?
Because they're like 12 year olds that are playing Xbox Live.
OMG free game.
Yeah, exactly like what you said earlier.
voice chat, I don't know I didn't party because I don't want to play with other people right now I believe voice chat is only available once you get into a zone it's not like in the lobby like it was in the first game I think it actually is, it's in party but one thing though for anybody who is playing on Sega's website, they do have a feedback form they want feedback from the beta apparently, so make sure that if you see any glitches, anything weird, anything you don't like
Make sure that you post about it on their page.
Doesn't it seem like they're kind of a little close, though, with only ten days to go?
I mean, is this going to be another eight days?
If it's something that just requires a general tweak or a change in code, then... But the games have already been shipped to retailers, essentially, waiting to go out.
But I think it's talking about, like, major glitches.
Yeah, I know, but here we go again, another Xbox 360 game where they're patching it on the back end to fix all the bugs.
You know, I'm just kind of like... That happens with any type of MMO.
MMOs exist to be glitchy.
I just hope it doesn't stay, you know, Wrappy Christmas for five years like the old Xbox one.
It sucks that it is glitchy, but we shouldn't expect MMOs to be glitchy.
That's just fucking laziness in programming is what it is.
I mean, you should be doing extensive beta testing, especially since the game came out already in Japan.
You've already got some beta testing right there, whatever you want to call it, but
I think it's really ridiculous just to say, oh yeah, this is a beta test and hopefully everything goes well because we already done the game.
So if we find a bug, yeah, that fucking sucks.
Any other thoughts on PSU?
The only other thing I don't like about it, and I know I'm being negative about it, but I do really like the game.
At least in PSO, you all kind of look the same, like, you know, all the forces had dresses and such, but their creation in this game, while it's highly detailed, the costumes, each, like, the numens and the humans for each gender, they all get the same costumes, so...
You see a lot of the same people running around.
It's pretty terrible, because, I mean, I don't want to see a whole bunch of people with just the black and red shirt on.
And it doesn't seem like anybody's really, you know, their own character because of it.
I do understand that the RBG slider has been removed to change color.
Oh, really?
I didn't know it was there in, like... It was in the old ones.
You could change the colors of the outfits.
Oh, um, no, it was...
The hair and different tones.
You can do it for some of the hairs.
And the eyes and stuff, which is really cool because you can do eyes before.
It's just depending on your face.
But I mean, at least there were different patterns on the different outfits you could pick in PSO.
But now it's just palette swaps and they look pretty terrible.
You know, since Miklatov likes to play a force, essentially what he's saying is he misses being able to wear a dress in Phantasy Star Online.
Yeah, actually, I kind of do.
It doesn't look like a Force if I'm wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt.
I'm sorry.
Dude, the Forces were great because the men had these evening gowns.
What I'm thinking is they probably removed some of the stuff for the beta.
I mean, because it's, you know, they cut down the file size.
I think it's actually like that on the PC version.
I'll have to, I actually have to ask my friend who's been playing it.
Oh, hopefully they'll release more later.
I don't know.
Thanks for watching!
Moving on to another Xbox-related story.
Microsoft is teaming up with Best Buy and the Boys and Girls Club of America to go on a 20-city bus tour.
They're going to be educating parents on the ESRB rating scheme and how to implement parental controls on the Xbox 360 and the Xbox Live service.
In other words, hopefully there'll be a tutorial on how to block asses on the Xbox 360 cams for parents.
So, you know,
This is a nice, you know, good service, feel-good community thing, but it certainly doesn't help in selling parents on Xbox 360s, does it?
I'm sorry?
I think it does.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anyway, the tour is going to be going around pretty much the top cities in the U.S.
where the most people are, you know, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle.
If you want to check out the full schedule, you can always check out xbox.com slash isyourfamilyset.
Is your family set, Loki?
I would hope so, because I don't have a family.
I'm set, so, you know...
I'm sat and ready to see some Xbox Cam boobies and cocks.
Let's make sure you're 18 and over, please.
I have the internet for boobs.
Well, I haven't seen any of that stuff yet, but yeah, that'd be kind of fun.
No, neither have I. I'm just kidding.
I don't really want to see it.
They should have a channel that's only that stuff.
Like the Underground?
Like, yeah, something like the Red Light District or something.
Well, yeah, you do get to classify yourself.
Call the Green Door.
Well, you get to classify yourself, you know, under Xbox.
Like, ooh, you're recreational, you're pro, you're Underground, right?
They do need Red Light District.
But I have never seen those categories actually dictate...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One such person, Tom Taylor, T-Squared for short, is actually some 20-something-year-old professional gamer who has landed a $250,000 gaming contract in addition to running his brand new video game tutoring company.
And basically...
The Associated Press spoke with him about his earning six figures, and basically his response to the whole thing was, he takes risks.
I take risks.
In order to get paid, you have to take risks.
I think I took the biggest risk I could take dropping out of school to play video games, and it paid off.
I guess some people are just born with talent in certain things, like Michael Jordan was born to play basketball.
I feel I was born to play video games.
Yeah, that's a really great role model.
Drop out of school so you can play video games professionally.
I don't want to see this guy.
I suggest all the gaming companies out there pick up this guy as your spokesperson.
That is the perfect role model you want for your customers.
Drop out of school because you know what?
You can buy some games on a minimum wage job.
It's fine.
I want them to hire me.
I finished school.
I'm an educated gamer.
I want to tear into this guy, but I can't help but think that would be a little bit hypocritical when I think back to college and all the class I missed due to Final Fantasy VII.
I used to skip class to watch Sailor Moon.
I think there's nothing wrong in the fact that playing video games for a profession... I mean, granted, that's pretty risky.
I mean, because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I think there's a difference, too, between high school dropout and college dropout.
College dropout, that's fine.
In this society, there's an expectation, you know, well, certainly, I mean, again, I guess it depends on which part of the country you're in, but, you know, there's a real pressure out there to really, you've got to graduate high school if you want to move up in the corporate world.
I mean, granted, there are jobs available, and I don't know, because it's like there's exceptions to every rule, but I just feel like
Blackboy says, wait, how many pop stars never went to college?
Well, I have no problem with people not going to college because, you know what, personally, I didn't go to college and I don't think I really missed anything because there are actually a lot of people that will start up their own businesses and stuff and they're very successful without going to college.
I mean, granted, college does help with certain jobs and stuff like that, but it's not necessary if you've already got the smarts to kind of do it.
You can pretty much start up a company and be successful without it.
I dropped out of college.
I'm not exactly proud of it, but at the time, it's what I had to do and I don't regret it.
I've actually been in college off and on now for about 10 years.
But see, though, high school is important.
I think you should be finishing high school.
I mean, because... Or at least test out of it.
Yeah, exactly.
You should be doing better education in high school, though.
Or, okay, I mean, I don't know.
I just have a really big problem with someone like this being, you know, kind of a sponsor.
Because, you know, all we need this guy is to actually start playing good and winning stuff.
And then, you know, we'll have him, you know,
I got really good by not going to high school.
Yeah, that's excellent.
In other words, kids, be cool.
Stay in school.
Exactly.
Other comments from our chat room here.
Funnydale says, this guy is going to be working at Burger King in five years, cleaning out the fat fryer.
Hitstun says, I could see him getting a right thumb injury and being out for a season and going broke.
So that's true.
What do you have to fall back on if you get carpal tunnel?
You're screwed, young man.
I have to have that Atari controller that used your eyebrows.
Or hopefully in the future we'll be controlling games with our brains.
Well, speaking of brains and certain people who remain unnamed on this radio show not using them!
Sorry.
Well, we've all been paying attention to the fact that Bully was pulled into court for being, you know, Violent Game, oh my god.
I have a new name for said...
How about Crack Frommson?
I still like Jackie Poo.
Oh, whatever.
Or Jackass.
At any rate, the verdict that went down, though, with the ruling is basically the judge is not going to prohibit the sale of Bully.
To quote, in the time that he played the game, the judge said he did not see anything so violent that would require the game to be held from being shipped.
The Judge and Take-Two employee used a cheat code in order to skip around in the game.
From what I understand, I think they played through the game for at least two hours.
And that's plenty of time to get a good feel for the game.
They're also saying that there wasn't anything different than what was seen on TV, really.
OMG, there's cheat codes to skip around in the game.
Excellent.
But if anyone's curious about how everybody's not friend, the real bully of the industry reacted, he was told to sit down.
Yeah, weren't there like outbursts in the courtroom and that whole thing?
Oh, I would have loved to have been there.
The thing is that he had no business being there because he has, you cannot work...
I think is legal advisor for something that you have an interest in.
He did mention though that he hoped that people got injured after playing this game so he could go, I told you so.
Didn't he like sneak a slingshot into the courtroom to make some type of point about this is what people are going to do?
Okay, okay.
I know we're not really supposed to talk about it.
What about Simpsons?
Bart has a slingshot.
I don't see slingshot related deaths in the news.
He's an idiot.
You can be educated and still be stupid.
And this man is living proof.
I cannot wait.
And actually, the thing about him being involved in this case is actually, from what I understand, precedent to have him disbarred in that state.
So let's hope it happens.
RavensDolphin says, Dennis the Menace has a slingshot.
Go back to, like, 50s, you know, homely.
40s, I think.
Was it?
40s, yeah.
They were on Nickelodeon when I was a kid, so...
It's human nature.
I'm trying to remember which philosopher said this, but the nature of man is nasty, brutish, and short.
You know, people are prone to violence.
It's written into our freaking DNA.
You know, no one talks about the dangers of cup stacking either.
Really, Jack Thompson... Oh, I said it.
Now I gotta go kill myself.
It's alright.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Doesn't that set the precedent that Walmart ought to be pulling copies of Kill Bill off the shelves and Pulp Fiction and other violent train spotting and other really violent movies?
It's a double standard.
Of course, maybe Jack Thompson would like that.
I don't know.
I said it too.
Spank, spank, spank.
Maybe they should change it to Bible Mart.
Look, it's still a very nasty double standard that we're seeing in the overall entertainment industry today.
Right now, video games is the current scapegoat.
I mean, that's how it is.
It was music in the 80s and early 90s.
It's evolved on to, you know, it was, back in the days, it was, you know, we can't watch this TV show because it's so risque.
And they attack in the middle.
Oh my God, Mr. and Mrs. Brady share a bed.
Who knew?
Oh my God.
Elvis.
and his hip thrusting.
Oh no.
Or, you know, people would go on, what was that example, on the Ed Sullivan show and ask him to change lyrics.
Women are going to look at that and get impregnated immediately.
Or even now with the whole, you know, not having, you know, available women's, you know, health care because we're going to decide to take over the world, you know, and fuck everybody.
I don't know.
Flaming Bozo in our chatroom says, why doesn't he go to porn?
Why doesn't he fight porn?
But at the same time, they don't sell porn at Walmart.
Because everybody knows Jackie Poo shops at Walmart.
I'm sure they sell Skinamax type movies there, but anyway.
We all know that the whole reason he's so retentive is that he's just not getting laid.
Wow.
That's it.
No one would.
Stories about our dear friend, Mr.
Get us a little bit angry.
I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but I get so frustrated whenever I read about what this clown's up to next.
It makes me just want to rant a little bit.
Doesn't it make you want to rant a little bit?
A little.
So I think it's time to bring on the trumpets and the symphonies to declare it be the FUs of the Week!
My F.U.
of the week goes towards the stupid evil sinus infection from hell.
For anyone who wasn't listening last year, I was sick for about two months with a weird combination of bronchitis and pneumonia because of the sinus infection.
Well, I have a sinus infection again, and it's starting off exactly the same way that my last one did.
So now they're pumping me full of antibiotics and all kinds of anti-allergy drugs and all kinds of crap.
It makes me feel absolutely loony and also lose my voice.
Like, I wake up in the morning and have no voice.
It's crazy.
And I love to talk, I guess, since I'm on a radio show and all that.
And I'm not always sick.
F you to Fireboma, too.
But, um...
A few to the sinus infection.
And also, the advice nurse was so funny.
She's like, now, you've got chronic fatigue syndrome.
It says here on your things you're going to get really tired.
No shit, lady.
But to their credit, the Kaiser folks were really nice to me and gave me my choice of antibiotics.
Yeah, I hate it.
You sound like I've been drinking whiskey all night.
I always thought that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome was an inclination to wearing camo, but, you know, I guess I'm wrong.
No, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is wearing camo and, you know, smoking the chronic.
Gotcha.
Anyways, F you to the Indian Casino that we went to last night because, you know, like most Indian... Actually, this Indian Casino seems to be the worst one.
It's Thunder Valley over here.
I believe it's in Rockland or something, whatever, in California.
And basically, they want to rape you for your money.
Kind of like America did to the Indians way back when.
But anyways, I did leave there the only losing 50 cents, so that's really good.
Oh, and by the way, for Rob, F you the fact that they do not have coconut shrimp.
My F you of the week goes to commuting.
I'm giving the FU to driving this week.
Who would have thought?
No, my FU goes to commuting and long commutes and they make me frumpy and sad.
That's it.
Mikotov.
My FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making a crappy Xbox 360 controller and ruining a brilliant game like Luminous because you guys can't make a D-pad.
And that's going to do it for this week's Dose of Angst.
It works so much better to play Luminous on PSP.
I have to use the analog stick on the 360, and I'll tell you, that's not really fun at all.
All right.
Well, speaking of Sony controllers, there's a new one coming out for the PlayStation 3, which was shown at Digital Life, which happened in New York City this weekend.
I'm sure some of our listeners, I know some of them were there.
I'm sure we'll get some calls in the Skype line a little later from the show from our folks who are at Digital Life.
But there were some awards handed out at Digital Life, and I'm assuming this was Digital Life and Ziff Davis that handed out these awards.
I have no idea how they picked them.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, wait, they do!
Okay, but to be fair, they have one for Xbox 360 as well, right?
No, they have computer and video game.
Whatever.
I don't give a shit, okay?
The point is, is that, you know, they got this award or whatever, so it seems like, in some folks' mind, maybe things are coming around for Sony, and maybe now Sony is starting to put out the... It's hard for me to say.
I didn't play PlayStation 3 at Digital
I'm going to be relying on the listeners who call in later in the show to tell us if the PlayStation 3 at Digital Life was deserving of this award.
I can just see it now.
You know why the PlayStation 3 is awesome?
Because it smells like money!
Somehow I doubt that's it.
What if they had really good games on display there?
Loki, you don't know.
You weren't there.
Yeah, but I saw the list of games and probably not.
Whatever, you know.
Hey, great.
Someone wants to spend $600 for the system.
More power to you.
Go pre-order it at EB.
Oh, wait.
Can't do that.
SSJ100 Matt says, Sky, they gave out Japanese whores and HD TVs.
DJ Kipples and Bits says, I went to Digital Life.
I have no idea how the PS3 won during that show.
Let's see.
Jaded2006 says, Just keep thinking that Sony is going to make a turnaround.
Hmm.
Very interesting.
Also, some other awards won at the show.
Gaming Hardware, PlayStation 3.
Gaming Software, Final Fantasy XII.
For those of you that have to shop for kids this holiday season, the best gift for kids was the Fisher-Price Spark Art Easel.
Is that like a Light Bright?
I don't know.
I miss Light Bright.
Best Booth also went to Sony.
But the hippest booth...
went to Napster.
Remember them?
Remember Napster?
Hey kids, remember Napster?
There had to have been recreational pharmaceuticals involved in that show.
I can neither confirm nor deny those statements again.
We'll hear from the listeners a little later in the show.
I'm sure they're already trying to hammer the Skype line to get in.
So we'll see.
And SSJ100 Matt is putting out a call.
Where's our listener Graywolf?
He's the guy in the forums that...
Unapologetic in a Sony fandom.
Who apparently writes in poetic prose form.
They're fun to read.
You know what?
I encourage the opposing viewpoint to the masses.
I encourage the opposing viewpoint as long as it's educated.
And I'm all for a little bit of friendly debate as long as it doesn't resort to name-calling.
Sony is apparently pretty happy after this week's pre-order fest at GameStop and EB.
Of course, in case you didn't hear, they sold out of all the systems that the stores got.
Well, it's not hard to sell out when you're only reserving 8 systems at a store.
I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, now, now, 8 was, you know, a larger number.
Some stores only got like 4, I think.
Well, some had 16, to be fair, but still.
8 to 16, whatever.
Anyway, so that's somewhere between 28,000 to about 58,000 systems.
It's not bad.
Basically, according to the Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson, Dave Cracker... Yeah, that's Cracker, alright.
His name's Cracker?
Well, Cracker, or Craker, or whatever.
Listen up, Cracker!
Anyways, sorry, it had to be said.
It was within minutes, because, you know, obviously...
Oh yeah, because you had the line going.
It reconfirms the excitement and anticipation that we've known since the very first discussion of PlayStation 3.
We're just pleased to see that the reaction from the consumer is as strong as we anticipated it would be.
It helps validate everything that we've been seeing up to this point.
So if I released a system with only one unit in the United States, we'd be like, we sold everything in one second.
It's awesome!
My rebuttal to Sony is, everyone just go read VG Cats, look at the last comic.
It perfectly illustrates it.
And you know what?
I'm sure we'll be covering this a little bit later on, but I don't think a lot of those people were keeping those systems.
It's more like, hey, you know what?
The Xbox 360 was being able to be sold for twice retail on eBay.
Hmm.
I'll tell you what, because I've got a PlayStation 3 pre-ordered.
I know, traitor.
My
No, you're just a gaming whore.
The DarkSakura Autographed Edition PS3.
Well, also, I mean, of course, the Wii did also sell out as well.
GameStop, and EB.
I believe each store was getting upwards to 32 systems.
I think it ended up being about twice what they were getting with the PlayStation 3.
Now, to give the pro-Sony side of this a little bit, I would believe there are 50,000 people in this country that excited about the PlayStation 3.
I mean, for tech junkies, it is a Blu-ray player.
It's pretty cheap.
That's pretty exciting.
I would believe that there's that many fanboys.
I don't think there's any.
It's hard to go, ooh, it's this ravaging success when you consider there's really only eight PlayStation 3s at the store to be reserved.
I don't know.
We'll see a little more towards November 17th.
But then again, like I've always been saying, is launch really that important?
PlayStation 2 didn't wow me at launch, but it really won me over about a year later.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe by a year later they will have actual systems in the stores.
Alright.
I want to ask Mikotov really quick while he's still here because he's going to be leaving in a little bit.
I wanted to ask you, you actually camped out for the Wii pre-order, right?
I totally did.
Tell us about that experience.
How did that go?
What time did you get there?
Who else was there?
So me and my roommate decided we were going to go do the Wii pre-order because we really, really want that system after playing it.
Because unlike some folks, I actually have to report to work at 8 o'clock in the morning.
Yeah, whatever.
I can go whenever I want.
And so we got up about 3.45 a.m.
to go to our local GameStop.
And he went a little bit earlier than I did, but I arrived about a little past 5.
And there were already 16 people ahead of me, which was insane to me.
Because, you know, I didn't think people were as stupid as I am.
Then again, this is the Bay Area.
This is, you know, tech home.
Yeah, that's true.
But I live in the sunset, which is like dead, so...
It was still shocking to me.
And then, you know, more people started showing up.
And around, I would say about maybe six, we had a good 30 people in line to help pass the time.
I played clubhouse games, which is okay.
And then I'd say about 9.30, we had a little over 70 people in line.
What's great about that is that the store opens at 10.
So at about 9.30, 9.40, an employee came out and those people who had been there since I would say about 7 or 8, the people that were towards the back, they got told that they would not be pre-ordering any systems today because they only got 32 in.
So I thought it was kind of jerky that the employees waited that long to come out and tell the people in the back of the line that they weren't going to get anything.
To their credit, though, corporate probably didn't tell them until then.
They probably didn't get an email until overnight or something.
That's not true.
That's not true.
They knew a few days in advance.
Poopy!
They're just jerks.
But anyway, so they let us in two at a time to pre-order our systems, and it went pretty smooth.
They gave out a list of stuff we could pre-order with the system while we were standing in line, put the $50 down, and then we were on our way.
It was really...
Thanks for watching!
What types of people did you see in line?
Was it all gaming nerds like you, or did you have the older parents?
I'm not a gaming nerd.
You are, but that's beside the point.
Were there any older people in the line?
Were there excited girls from college?
I saw maybe three girls.
And then the front of the line comprised of scrawny white guys and Asian guys.
And then the back of the line were the older parents that maybe...
I still don't think that pre-ordering the Wii is all that big of a deal just because Nintendo loves us and you know they're making lots of them
I just wanted the security.
Plus, I kind of plan on maybe camping for the PS3.
So, I didn't want to try to get too... Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.
eBay, eBay, eBay.
And that was that.
Alright, well, thanks for sharing your story.
We appreciate it.
That was very nice of you.
Alright.
How about some more?
Anything else you want to say on PS3 pre-orders?
Well, I mean...
There are going to be more pre-orders, I'm sure, around the world.
The whole thing is, it's going to be very hard to come by.
Just very, very hard.
So if you are looking to get one, try to get it as soon as possible.
Because it is going to be like the Xbox 360 was last year.
And you might end up having to buy it on eBay if you really want it day one.
And to be honest, I would wait.
I mean, if it were me, I would wait just because a lot of launch games you may be looking forward to are delayed until next year.
So, you know, kind of keep that in mind when you're thinking about pre-ordering it.
All right.
Let's go on to some more gaming news.
Well, speaking of back to the whole Sony camp, there is actually one thing that I am personally excited about coming out on PSP, and that's After Burner.
Sega did confirm they have a deal with Planet Moon Studios to do a PSP version, a new one, of Afterburner.
So if anyone who was into the original, hey.
And there's a quote actually from the CEO of Planet Moon.
Most importantly, it's approximately 9,000% more portable than the original arcade cabinet.
That just struck me as a stupid quote.
But anyway, it's going to be called Afterburner Black Falcon.
It will have 19 officially licensed customizable planes, a single player modem, and Wi-Fi multiplayer.
And they're slated for spring 2007.
And I'd like to mention we also mentioned that back on episode 200.
That was also one of the big stories we came out with.
I see one of those under the radar things.
Yes.
All right, well.
It's been confirmed.
You're not a liar, Loki.
Way to go.
I know.
Full Auto 2 on PSP, March 14th, 2007.
Heard it here first.
Now, if that's the one that doesn't happen, I'm going to laugh my ass off just to share.
Okay.
Speaking of Sony things, Eurogamer got a really in-depth look at PlayStation 3, the interface and the online.
Check it out.
They got a pretty in-depth article over at Eurogamer.net.
Some of the highlights from their tour, of course, the PlayStation 3 is going to be using what's called the Cross Media Bar.
So if you've played the PSP at all, you're already familiar with how the PS3 is going to be set up, which is kind of interesting that they have that very similar layout between the two.
It kind of makes me wonder if the Wii and DS are going to be similar like that too.
I don't know.
They talk about how you're going to have web browsing on the PlayStation 3, something that the Xbox 360 does not have currently.
Hopefully it will have better flash support.
and Streaming Media Support.
It's got the cell processor.
I would imagine it can run this stuff.
There's the friends bar and there's different icons there.
Your signed in friends show their own icons on the bar there.
Other icons would be those that are managing the PlayStation Network account.
There's a master account and associated accounts.
I'm assuming that's for a family setup there.
You could also, with the master account, limit what your kids do on their accounts and how much they can spend
on the PlayStation Store, which is another section of the bar.
And of course, we all know SingStar is going to be huge on the PlayStation Store right out the gate.
So if you want to check out more on the tour of online and what to expect there, check it out at Eurogamer.net.
And you know what's funny is the Sony Store that they're going to have on there, no point system like the Microsoft and Nintendo teams are doing.
It's just going to be dollars or your currency.
So that's kind of interesting, I thought.
I don't know.
But there's a comment from Mike in the chatroom, Loki is the only one that likes Full Auto.
And maybe that's true, maybe that's why nobody else has been reporting on it, because you're the only person that likes Full Auto.
So, I didn't care for Afterburner.
You know, I still reported on it.
To be honest, Oblivion, it was a great game, but eh, it's so.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One thing that was kind of interesting, and we talked about it a little bit before about Sony and the rumor that X-Fire is going to be teaming up with them for some online partnership and stuff.
And Sony came out and said, no, no, no, that's not true, that's only for one game.
Actually, no, it is true.
It actually is going to be happening, and it was officially announced.
They're going to be using the middleware, or they're going to be kind of teaming up for a middleware solution that's going to be an add-on to the current...
X-Fire
I actually, I really like X-Fire.
I think it's a pretty nice little app.
Even if MTV does own it, I really like it.
It's a cool little application.
So, that should be interesting.
I could be some brownie points for the PlayStation 3 as far as I'm concerned.
It's going to need as many brownie points as it can get.
But as far as the delay circumstances, there's actually a rumor that came out.
One of the Spanish gaming sites called Maristation said that Kutaragi warned there would be a shortage of PS3 stock in Japan and North America and that Europe would have to wait even longer than they already are.
But a Sony spokesperson has said that that was categorically not true.
I love how they always...
He was eating grams at the time.
It's okay.
Exactly.
Well, see, it said that he hasn't done any media briefings since the Tokyo Game Show.
That's because they had him, you know, chained to his jungle gym in his house so that he wouldn't go run out into traffic and die because they need him.
To spread weird rumors.
Well, at any rate, Sony's actually planning on shipping 6 million PS3 units on a global scale by...
The end of the 2007 fiscal year.
Cool.
Alright.
They can plan it, whether it happens or not, hey.
Do you think there will be further delays?
Despite all this?
I don't doubt it.
Possibly if they run into hardware problems.
If they run into the overheating problems or anything like that.
Something that they didn't foresee.
Well, they actually, you remember all those issues they had with the first model PlayStation 2s.
Although, amazingly enough, I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2.
and I've had it for years and it hasn't had any problems.
But a lot of them were having issues with coming off track, overheating.
I'm seeing there actually being lots of issues for the PS3.
All right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Cyro Interactive Very anime-ish looking game, but it's an adventure type game.
It's also coming in a limited edition.
Everybody's Tennis, also coming out.
It's the Korean version, actually.
It's coming out on October 19th.
Sudoku Master on the PlayStation 2.
Should also be noted that various Wild Arms games are coming out in Sony's version of the Best Hits.
So you can get that cheaper through your importer if you are looking for games such as that.
Coming out on the DS...
Um, several games in the Kodomo no Tami no Yomi Kikasi series are coming out.
Uh, I'm not sure what type of games those are.
Children's something.
Yeah, some type of children's game there.
Just a miscellaneous.
It's by Starfish.
Creates this games.
Creates these, so.
Several games in that series.
That's pretty awesome.
Uh.
Yeah, if I understood any of what I just said, yeah, it would be pretty awesome.
Well, anyways.
Um.
Actually, the U.S.
is going to be getting quite a bit of stuff as well.
This week is a very good week for games, so lots of good stuff.
Including, of course, Bully, the game that's been getting so much controversy lately on PlayStation 2.
We have Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception on the PSP.
You can get your flight sim on there.
If you're looking to get your flight sim on on the PC, Microsoft Flight Simulator X is going to be coming out.
as well as Contact on the DS, Destroy All Humans 2 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
And the first one was really fun, so I'm looking forward to playing this one.
Family Guy on PlayStation 2, PSP, and Xbox.
That one actually looks pretty good.
I kind of thought that was going to be a crappy, like, kind of a port of a TV show, but it looks pretty good.
Nintendogs, Dalmatian and Friends.
Why...
Why this late in the game?
Because people still like the puppies.
For those that were too lazy to unlock the Dalmatian in the first one.
Not lazy, just had to find the hat.
Anyways, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on the 360, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also on the 360.
I know Sims 2 Pets will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and DS, as well as SpongeBob Creature from the Krusty Krab on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.
Yippee.
And then finally, on the PC, we have Battlefield 2142.
And that is going to be coming out as well.
But you know what?
Maybe you just don't have time to go buy a game like that.
So we are going to give one away.
And how might you be able to do this, to enter in?
It's actually pretty simple.
All you have to do, and this contest will be running until Wednesday, is go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash BF
and 2142 for Battlefield 2142.
Just simply enter the contest there and there will be a random drawing on Wednesday and we'll be announcing it in Part A of Episode 205.
And they'll be able to get that right away.
Yes, they'll be able to get it right away.
It's a digital distribution thing.
It's a digital download code so you'll be able to download it straight to your PC.
So look forward to that and I look forward to giving a full review about the game next week.
Now, doesn't Desperate Housewives come out this week?
Because I noticed in our chat room, somebody had said they just saw a commercial on VH1.
Who said that?
I think that was last week, to be honest.
Was it?
I think it was.
Oh, JVmon says, a commercial for the Desperate Housewives video game just aired on VH1.
Which means someone's watching Flavor of Love.
Shame, shame.
Metal Slug!
Metal Slug!
Metal Slug!
King of Fighters, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, more stuff.
All right.
Down the line.
Have fun, you folks over in Europe, playing your renamed version of Bully.
What is up with that?
I still don't get that.
I guess Bully must have a real negative context overseas or something.
Could someone please enlighten me from overseas?
What's wrong with the word Bully?
I don't know.
Hmm.
This issue has been going back and forth and I'm getting to the point where I just don't care anymore.
I guess you could call this a follow-up.
Last week we said something about how GameStop was tooting their horn that the Wii demo kiosks were going to be exclusive to their store.
Well, guess what?
Nintendo of America says, uh-uh, quote, playable Wii setups will be available at a variety of retail outlets.
We expect that anyone who wants to try Wii will be able to through multiple different methods.
In addition to retail outlets, Wii will be playable at a number of mall tours throughout the company, the nationwide Nintendo Fusion Tour, and other grassroots consumer events, which means Loki was misinformed about this when he told us this
GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop
Hey, whatever works.
Maybe the whole thing, you know, this is kind of, I know this is getting into another story, but maybe the whole thing has to do with interference from lighting.
And maybe not being able to control that, and that might have something to do with it.
Oh, whatever.
I thought that was a bunch of BS, but whatever.
Who knows?
Whatever.
It's just speculation right now.
Well, an interesting rumor has come out about the Wii console is that it might actually be running Linux already.
Ha!
So for those folks that love to install Linux on new things, whether it be, you know, the Nintendo DS, the PSP, a toaster, a Billy Bass, whatever the hell, you know.
Too bad, Nintendo beat you to it.
Yes, exactly.
Apparently, a Nintendo insider who blogs under the internet moniker Kiyoshi Saruwatari That means something about monkey.
Anyways, claims that the Wii console will run an open source Linux OS.
And, of course, that hasn't been confirmed.
It's purely speculation right now, but it's basically used for the back end of
Using the software for porting stuff in there like the Opera browser and stuff like that.
And it says it will be closed and will only allow signed code.
But of course, anyone that remembers that kind of stuff knows that people break that pretty quick.
Good.
Use it to break the region lock.
That's the first thing I want you Linux nerds to work on if this is indeed true and the Wii already has it on there.
I want you to work on the region lock in case there's, you know...
OhAndDon for the Wii.
I want that shit imported.
ASAP.
Thank you.
Could you imagine OhAndDon on the Wii?
I'm thinking about it and I'm wearing a warm smile.
Well, as far as other things that are... Oh, and hold on.
I'd like to... Sorry.
And I hate having to read these.
Bad Transition.
Five points from Gryffindor.
Hey!
I was on my way to a very wonderful transition.
And this will be the last story that we have from Kiyoshi Saruwati because apparently the whole thing was a practical joke made up by him to get spread around the world.
So that will be next from the podcast.
Thank you very much.
So you just made up the last five minutes.
Oh no, I'm keeping that in.
Okay, I am reporting the news, okay?
I said it was purely speculation and this is what this guy said.
It's all his fault, not mine.
I just report the news.
I think that's funny.
Don't shoot the messenger.
I think that's really freaking funny.
Well, there's five minutes of my life I won't get back.
Speaking of things that I also think are funny is not really the story.
Nintendo has announced a launch of LiveMove, which is a development tool to make it easy to produce titles for the Wii easier and faster.
It was made by, I guess that would be iLive, artificial intelligence specialists.
At any rate, it's supposed to help allow a developer to train the Wii Remote just by performing motions.
To quote on here from iLive's chairman, Wei Yan, LiveMove will allow the game industry to move away from indirect digital control to more natural analog control for the first time.
Genyo Takeda, who's Nintendo's senior MD of Integrated Research and Development, said,
basically, um, said, when Nintendo's development team saw a live move, we instantly recognized how easy it would greatly increase our ability to explore and experiment with new concepts and make our lives easier.
So, I'm looking to see how, uh, what they can come up with that.
They've made some, uh,
Another quote on here, actually, that I think was really cool is, this revolutionary tool liberates the imaginations of game creators.
Which I think, actually, the whole concept of having something that you can use free motion to actually program with, I think really just links very well to the whole mission behind the Wii.
So you have innovative games, but you have innovative development going with it.
All right.
Well, maybe some developers that want to see what's coming up in Nintendo's world might want to check out the Nintendo Space World Show.
Of course, the Nintendo World Show for short.
It's going to be November 3rd in Nagoya and November 12th in Osaka.
And that was from Nintendo's official Japan site.
So check it out if you're over in Japan and want to check out what Nintendo's up to.
Because remember, they don't do Tokyo Game Show.
So this is kind of their version of that.
That's pretty awesome.
There will be, of course, hands-on Wii demos and new DS games.
I want to go.
Anyways, well, start saving those pennies quick.
Well, some interesting stuff that they're doing with the GameCube version of Twilight Princess in Japan.
It's only being offered online, kind of similar to what they do with Electroplankton over here.
The main reason Nintendo is doing this is to avoid both versions of the game in stores at the same time because of the Wii launch.
They would much rather see the Wii Zelda sell than the GameCube version and that wouldn't be a guarantee if the two versions are on the same shelf.
There is no information on whether this same procedure will be passed on to Europe and the US as well.
Interesting.
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see if they do that in the US as well.
I don't think they will.
I think there's a lot more demand for the old GameCube games here.
I think there's a lot of folks that buy the earlier generations of consoles because they're cheaper.
So I think they'll still be on shelves out here.
And you know what?
I mean, some people might not want to use the Wii to play Zelda.
Well, wasn't there an old story that said you could plug in the old GameCube controller and use that on the Wii version still?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Actually, it's kind of funny.
I had a discussion with Dan about this not too long ago.
He said that he's actually thinking about just picking it up on GameCube anyway instead of on Wii.
Just for the hell of it or just because of the controls?
Just because the control...
Instead of a few things changed from the E3 demo version that I wasn't too happy with, like not being able to use the remote actually for the sword at all, you have to slash.
Oh, weird.
And I was like, no, I don't like that.
So we're probably just getting it on GameCube.
All right.
Well, or you might just have both because you're a whore for Link like that, right?
Well, I don't know.
I didn't play Wind Waker.
I refuse to play Wind Waker.
Well, that's a different... That's fake, cartoony Link.
That's not the real deal.
Alright, well that is about going to wrap it up for our Part A, but you know, over the past few weeks, we have not been able to end Part A of Orange Lounge Radio until we get to some DDR previews, and that's what we're going to do right now.
We're going to take a look at some new tracks here from DDR Universe and DDR Ultramix 4.
These are new Dance Dance Revolution games coming out from Konami a little bit later this year.

Outro Music
That was Jondi and Spech here on the DDR Sneak Peeks with We Are Connected.
That's going to be coming to DDR Universe.
Keep in mind that will be cut down a little bit, though.
That was the full version you heard, and DDR songs tend to be about a minute and a half to a minute and 45 in length.
So check that out.
And our old buddy, DJ Morpheus, who's in chat right now, the one and only from UndersedationLive.org, made it funny in the chat.
He said Stephen Hawking is on vocals in that song.
So you're crazy.
Alright, anyway, let's go to another song here.
This is from DDR Ultramix 4.
And this is a song by Wave Group featuring Scotty D. And of course you know Wave Group.
They've done some of those cover songs that were in Beatmania.
And we've played other songs by them previously during this promotion.
Well they have a song and it's a little bit jazzy.
It's called Stompin' at the Gotham.
And it's the next song we're going to play here on the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Keep it going!
Stop into the Gotham here on the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.
That was a fun one.
Nice big band sound to that.
That was very fun.
That was a fun one.
That'll be cool to play in DDR.
Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peeks
Forever in the sky, forever young, you're working well
Coming soon to Dance Dance Revolution Universe Day Behavior with Close Your Eyes the Activated Mix here on Orange Lounge Radio
Zetsubou Tekida
So check it out.
It's Zetsubou Tekida here on Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.
Alright, here on Orange Lounge Radio by Nico Girard, that is Zetsubou Tekida, or at least I think that's how you pronounce it, but watch it be like some crazy thing where the Z is silent, I don't know.
But that's coming to DDR Ultramix 4, and possibly Beatmania 2DX someday, I don't know, that's kind of how I think that song is, very 2DX-ish song.
That song had no imagination whatsoever.
Really?
Not a fan of that song?
No.
Well...
