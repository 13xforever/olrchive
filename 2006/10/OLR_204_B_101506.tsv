0	27640	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 204 for this October the 15th of 2006.
27640	30600	If this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget that Orange Lounge
30600	34880	Radio is podcast twice a week, so you're actually listening to the second half of a show already
34880	35880	in progress.
35880	39200	If you want to catch the whole thing live when it broadcasts, you should listen to Orange
39200	44080	Lounge Radio live on Sunday nights, or there's always our rebroadcast that plays on all games
44080	49240	radio Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
49240	55260	Speaking of all games radio, our buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show over there Sunday
55260	59520	nights as well just before we do, he's going to be doing some type of trivia contest at
59520	64640	the big video games expo, which I wish I was going, but sadly I'm not.
64640	70000	The VG Expo, if you're within traveling distance, unfortunately, when I talk about going now
70000	72760	we're talking about a plane ticket, but for those of you on the East Coast, it's probably
72760	75640	very drivable from lots of different spots on the East Coast.
75640	76640	Check it out.
76640	83080	Valley Forge Convention Center right outside Philly, October 27th through the 29th, VGExpo.com.
83080	85880	Bobby wanted me to point out, for those of you that went to Digital Life, this is only
85880	90080	a couple hours from New York, and this is nothing but games at this show, so check it
90080	91080	out.
91080	94800	Bobby's going to be doing some game show hosting, which I'm a little bit jealous because I like
94800	101200	hosting game shows, but sadly no con has asked us to do a game show yet, oh well.
101200	102200	Such is life.
102200	103200	Yes.
103200	104200	Back to games.
104200	105200	Exactly.
105200	110240	Well, such is life that we would have more news about Halo 3 at some point, and at some
110240	111640	point it's going to be Halloween.
111640	120720	Yes, the spooky holiday will feature some brand new news about Halo 3, and yeah, that's
120720	123880	about all we know is that there's going to be news.
123880	131040	It's news about upcoming news, and Halo 3 is coming soon.
131040	133440	That's going to be the big news.
133440	136600	Do you think, as we theorized previously, because you know you have that whole report
136600	141620	talking about Halo 3 is likely to be coming out in April or May, do you think this could
141620	143520	be where they drop that bombshell?
143520	145620	Could this be the big bombshell that's coming out?
145620	149200	It would be aptly timed, but probably not.
149200	152840	Do you think it's more something along the notion of gameplay?
152840	158680	You know this is time, though, to take a little bit of Sony's thunder from PlayStation 3,
158680	163640	to get people talking about Halo 3 amongst the PlayStation 3 and Wii chaos that's sure
163640	164640	to be going on in November.
164640	168600	Well, I guess currently right now they're showing Halo 3 to a select group of magazine
168600	176880	journalists, not websites, but a handful of magazine folks, and yeah, it looks like they're
176880	182760	going to be having some sort of an event, and they're inviting game journalists from
182760	189160	the U.S. and Europe to visit their studio and show a quick single player demo.
189160	195160	All right, well, you know, I would say go out and buy the magazine to see the news,
195160	198160	but it's going to be all over the Internet the day it comes out anyway, probably before
198160	204280	it lands in your mailbox, so just read the Internet.
204280	211080	Speaking of things that are at least being said around the Internet and other places,
211080	212080	Sony's talking some crap.
212080	225080	Actually, to be specific, that would be Nobuyuki Ide, who was the former CEO of Sony.
225080	229920	He's actually their current chief corporate advisor, so when he was asked about the Xbox
229920	236200	360 beating the PS3 to market, he said Microsoft is not a technology company.
236200	239320	No, they make lunchboxes.
239320	248480	Well, and Nintendo makes cards, at least they used to back in the day, but, you know.
248480	249840	Yeah, they made Hanafuda cards.
249840	252120	Does it used to run brothels, too?
252120	255960	I really don't know.
255960	262480	I just think that that's funny, because this guy was responsible for a lot of damage to
262480	268800	Sony's profits back in the day.
268800	274040	I think that it would be in Sony's best interest right now not to be throwing mud.
274040	275040	That's what I would be doing.
275040	279040	You know, concentrate on getting your console out instead of saying, our console is better
279040	283800	than your console, except our console is not out yet, and yours is.
283800	289200	Well, Sony pisses me off even more, because they're discontinuing the iBo.
289200	290200	I love the iBo.
290200	291920	Yeah, but the iBo is useless.
291920	294120	The iBo is their little robot dog.
294120	297800	I think that if they're going to do anything, they should make the iBo a peripheral for
297800	298800	the PS3.
298800	299800	That would sell more units.
299800	302240	Oh, yeah, I think that might actually happen.
302240	304360	That might sell me one.
304360	305360	I'd buy one.
305360	306360	That's just what I need.
306360	308360	My PlayStation 3 to bark at me and play Blu-rays.
308360	310000	Brilliant idea, Jamie.
310000	318320	After all, I mean, after looking at the iAdjudgment setup that they have at G, I think I'd rather
318320	320480	have a barking PlayStation 3 in that iAdjudgment.
320480	321480	No, no, no.
321480	322480	It wouldn't bark.
322480	328280	It would hook up to the PS3, and instead of having Nintendogs, you'd have a real dog sim
328280	329600	because you'd have your robot dog.
329600	332240	So it's like Rob the Robot.
332240	337040	But only good for more than one game.
337040	339680	This is why you're on Internet radio, Jamie, and not in a boardroom.
339680	340680	You know what?
340680	342720	My idea is with some money.
342720	343720	People should hire me.
343720	346160	They need to create Rob the Robot.
346160	350360	I always wanted a miniature version of it for the DS or something like that, that would
350360	354680	sit next to your DS and do the same little thing and just re-release Gyromite or something
354680	355680	like that.
355680	356680	I think that'd be fun.
356680	360440	Well, actually, one of the good things about the iBo is it actually was a very inexpensive,
360440	367120	pretty, you know, interestingly complex AI in the little system that you could afford
367120	373080	better than a human-sized robot, and a lot of AI developers and robotics experts were
373080	375440	actually buying iBos for experiments.
375440	378800	Drunami in our chat room is suggesting that here on Orangetown's radio, we could replace
378800	380800	Loki with an iBo.
380800	381800	That would be cute.
381800	382800	That would be pretty fun.
382800	383800	I bet the iBo is a lot cuter.
383800	385800	iBos are really cute.
385800	392440	It'd go well with my new Mac when I get it.
392440	395800	Speaking of Sony, before Loki has a chance to give a counter argument there, speaking
395800	400160	about Sony executives who are sitting in boardrooms eating crayons all day when they ought to
400160	407000	be working, this executive, Michael Ephraim from Sony of Australia, you know, he made
407000	411880	this crazy comment earlier in the week that was essentially insinuating that the Wii and
411880	416200	the 360 were too pricey.
416200	422320	The maker of the most expensive console for the next gen says the Wii and the 360 are
422320	423320	too pricey.
423320	424320	Okay, whatever.
424320	427600	Well, he further clarified his statements later in the week, but this is what he said,
427600	432020	quote, sorry you didn't have the opportunity to buy a PlayStation 3 this year, but I'm
432020	436240	sure it beats lining up in a queue for hours on end only to be told the store has sold
436240	437240	out.
437240	438240	Okay.
438240	441600	No doubt in response to the delays over in Europe and some of the other countries.
441600	445240	So yeah, too bad you didn't have that opportunity to do that now.
445240	450100	Don't worry, your opportunity is coming soon.
450100	456080	This just goes, look, again, I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is going to be a just fine system.
456080	459240	Give it a little, it's like a fine wine, it will age just fine.
459240	464840	But Sony executives, seriously, gag order, seriously Sony, if you're listening, you
464840	471200	need all these people to STFU, you need to get a public figure that is not going to be
471200	478040	a laughing stock of the internet such as Reggie Miyamoto over there or Major Nelson, Peter
478040	483280	Moore over here, Sony needs somebody like that.
483280	489760	And I'll tell you what, it's not this guy, it's not Kaz, giant enemy crab guy, who as
489760	493440	I hear has suffered so much embarrassment from that, he doesn't do public appearances
493440	494440	anymore.
494440	498360	I feel bad for him almost in a way, his boss has probably made him do that, and Kaz.
498360	503200	Oh, I'm sure they leave giant enemy crabs at his desk and stuff like that.
503200	507000	You know that game is just never going to come out now, or if it does come out, that
507000	509120	will be on the big sticker.
509120	512800	It should be one of those things like the movie Showgirls, where at this point it should
512800	518440	just be self-aware of the joke that it is now and just market itself as, hey, we're
518440	520760	that historically accurate game with the crabs.
520760	522880	That would be funny though.
522880	524720	Maybe they could just say the game caught crabs.
524720	528140	He goes to his doctor for a physical, I've got bad news for you.
528140	531720	You have giant enemy crabs, poor guy.
531720	536560	Anyways, yeah, but as if it wasn't bad enough, you know, that Sony is opening their mouth
536560	541640	and getting themselves in trouble, now of course they're receiving flak from the most
541640	547160	likely of places, a Microsoft blogger, whoo, anyways.
547160	553640	But this apparent Microsoft blogger was talking about their PS3 online service and saying
553640	558840	that, well, it seems to be a mishmash of online accounts, logins, services, for example, now
558840	564360	when I play a PS3 title, I simply can't depend on having a single friends list, Sony will
564360	570120	manage the master list, which should have presence in every PS3 title, and XFire will
570120	574120	be a plugin that some publishers integrate into some games, and some won't.
574120	578240	That means gamers can't depend on finding their friends in one place.
578240	582840	And he goes on talking about more other stuff and talking about how XFire is going to cost
582840	586360	money because they're, you know, licensing it and stuff, and what's that going to do
586360	589520	with the whole service and the fact that we haven't really heard much about, you know,
589520	594560	their online service and, yeah, so who knows.
594560	597920	So some fair, equal time type stories here.
597920	600440	Microsoft's doing some of the smack talking too.
600440	605180	Maybe should be leaving the PR to folks like Major Nelson and maybe some of the underground
605180	610800	communities, the huge Xbox fan communities out there, some of our other friendly podcasts
610800	613480	such as Gamertag and XBL, you know.
613480	618280	But there is some other interesting stuff though, and this is funny because as soon
618280	626840	as they, you know, ran this, that of course someone had to come to Sony's defense, and
626840	627840	that they did.
627840	633600	And actually, they were talking about, you know, some of the information and they also
633600	640800	posted it in their blog saying there's some bad information, you know, there responding
640800	642200	to the blog post.
642200	648040	That I'll get to in a sec, but it was interesting to me because it highlights some pretty core
648040	652120	differences in the approach that the PlayStation folks have taken and just kind of talking
652120	656760	about how, you know, the XFire friends list is not a replacement for the PS3 friends list
656760	664960	and that it's, you know, I don't know, it's basically Sony's, some guy named Smed.
664960	674960	All right, yeah, so very interesting, yeah, their online president, Smed.
674960	675960	Okay.
675960	678720	Welcome to Sony, eat this crayon.
678720	684120	All right, look, let's go from all these smack talking executives to you guys smack talking
684120	685720	us in our mailbag.
685720	688280	No, just kidding, we haven't gotten a lot of hate mail recently, have we?
688280	689280	Not really.
689280	690280	Oh, that's good, that's good.
690280	693120	I'm glad you guys have been nice and polite, we appreciate that.
693120	697040	You can send us an email, it's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com and every week Dark
697040	702400	Sakura suits up with her rubber gloves and his besto suit and digs in there and tries
702400	706800	to avoid the anthrax and the flames from the hate mail, of which we haven't gotten much
706800	707800	lately.
707800	710440	Actually, I did get anthrax lately, but it was with Public Enemy bringing the noise.
710440	714400	I see, but me saying, you know, we haven't gotten hate mail, you know, that just encouraged
714400	717480	like five pieces of hate mail for this week, so that should be fun.
717480	719440	We like getting the hate mail, it's fun to read.
719440	721400	Sometimes it's amusing for five seconds.
721400	725000	Yeah, so anyway, let's read some of our email, shall we Dark Sakura?
725000	729600	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, send us more.
729600	738800	Well, the first email actually comes from Orko4, basically saying that in Hickory, North
738800	744720	Carolina there was a restaurant called Tallywhacker's, me bringing up how they should make peckers
744720	748960	as a thing to hooters, and that the owner wanted the waiters to be shirtless and wearing
748960	754080	speedos but they couldn't for help violations, so they wore, you know, really tight ass shorts
754080	755080	and tank tops.
755080	757760	Oh yeah, I remember you talking about the mail hooters a couple weeks ago.
757760	759280	They went out of business.
759280	760880	I wonder why.
760880	763600	And the last line says, keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear the Doctor Who
763600	764600	website of the week.
764600	768040	Well, it's not Doctor Who this week, so ugh.
768040	769040	It's Torchwood.
769040	770040	That's a spin-off.
770040	772560	I see.
772560	780280	Next comes from Mike, hey, the other day I saw a Nintendo presentation on game trailers.
780280	782040	Is that how it really started off, hey!
782040	783040	It said hey.
783040	786480	It said suddenly it's that little fairy that follows you in The Legend of Zelda, wasn't
786480	787480	it, Natty?
787480	788480	Hey, listen!
788480	789480	Hey, listen!
789480	793480	That's how I want you all to open up your emails from now on.
793480	795480	Hey, listen!
795480	802240	Anyway, to continue, it says that the price points for the Virtual Console 500, 700, and
802240	806320	1000 points are actually awarded as starting at points.
806320	810000	So does this mean that we could be paying $15 for a Nintendo 64 game?
810000	812000	Just wanted to hear your thoughts.
812000	813000	Possibly.
813000	814000	We'll see.
814000	817120	I went through behind him.
817120	818960	You know what I was just thinking about, though?
818960	824240	If Ocarina of Time does come to Virtual Console, why would I get that?
824240	827520	Because I have the little GameCube disc that had it on there, so.
827520	829400	Yeah, that was a limited release, so.
829400	830400	Yeah, whatever.
830400	833640	I thought the Nintendo 64 was going to be $10.
833640	841240	I thought it was $5 for NES, $8 for Super Nintendo, $10 for Nintendo 64.
841240	842240	Yeah.
842240	843240	Oh.
843240	844240	Okay.
844240	845240	Another email from Michael.
845240	850520	It says, hey, Skyloki and DarkSakura and maybe Drudami, who is not here tonight.
850520	851520	He's in our chat.
851520	852520	Stop that.
852520	853520	Stop what?
853520	860640	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
860640	862320	Rob, only you can see this.
862320	863760	Oh, look, you can see it, too.
863760	864760	But it's aimed toward you.
864760	865760	I see.
865760	866760	Thank you.
866760	867760	Is that your IQ?
867760	868760	One?
868760	869760	No.
869760	870760	Mail?
870760	871760	Email?
871760	874160	First off, I'd like to say that I love your show.
874160	875160	Thank you.
875160	879480	And I've been listening on the podcast stream for a year and a few months, and I most recently
879480	881240	listened live last week.
881240	890200	Speaking of which, I was the one who called in and hung up Tassete Purim, I guess I said
890200	891200	that.
891200	892200	I think it's Latin.
892200	893200	I didn't take Latin.
893200	894200	Sorry.
894200	895800	I think he's actually renamed himself in chat to just call me Mike.
895800	897200	So we'll call him Mike.
897200	898200	Hi, Mike.
898200	899200	Sorry about that.
899200	901840	I forgot to mute the live stream while using Skype.
901840	902840	Oops.
902840	905800	Anyway, earlier on Xbox, what's up with me?
905800	908840	On episode 203, sports games came up.
908840	911600	Most of the hosts on OLR aren't sports games fans.
911600	914000	You said that sports games are just a roster update.
914000	916280	Well, the same can be said about music games.
916280	921080	Sure, games like DDR have a few very marginal new innovations, but for the most part, the
921080	923480	games are just the same damn thing with new music.
923480	926720	And to some idiotic gamers, they just hear weird Japanese techno and they think it's
926720	931120	the same damn thing with the same music and a new number after the title.
931120	935400	While I disagree with both arguments, I think that both make a valid point.
935400	937880	So here's my call to the game developers and producers.
937880	939840	Don't make a new game until it's ready.
939840	944080	Sure, your game can have all the songs or players in the world, but don't put it out
944080	947560	until it is better than its predecessor.
947560	951800	That's exactly what they're doing at 3D Realms.
951800	952800	What?
952800	956280	It took Nukem forever.
956280	959100	They're making sure that it's ready.
959100	960100	Is email done?
960100	961100	No.
961100	962100	Okay.
962100	963420	Because I want to say something, but go ahead.
963420	966460	This goes for all games, not just music or sports games.
966460	968600	Take the Halo franchise, for example.
968600	969860	Halo 1, a masterpiece.
969860	971800	Halo 2, an Unreal Tournament skin.
971800	974240	Don't get me wrong, I play Halo 2 almost exclusively.
974240	977600	Halo 2 was pushed out the door too quickly and just for live experience.
977600	982220	Halo 2 was an unsatisfying game that could have been even better than the original.
982220	985560	Then the master of re-releasing a game, whether it needs to be or not.
985560	986560	Metal Slug.
986560	987600	I love Metal Slug.
987600	988600	It rocks.
988600	992080	But when it's been pushed toward me on every available medium with no new features, it
992080	995280	makes me never want to buy a Metal Slug game again, even if it has every feature in the
995280	996280	world.
996280	998880	I love Metal Slug.
998880	1000920	Anyway.
1000920	1002600	Game developers need to realize something.
1002600	1006120	Sure, you release the sequel to a good game, it sells well.
1006120	1008140	But what if you want to make it a trilogy?
1008140	1009500	Is it accepted?
1009500	1011820	Or is it looked on as milking the franchise?
1011820	1017240	It makes sense in the short term, but in one of the worst options in the long run.
1017240	1023600	Soon gamers will get smart and realize they are being scammed by buying the same game
1023600	1025000	every year.
1025000	1028520	I've been trying to tell this to anyone who will listen, sadly I think it's too late.
1028520	1031640	PS, sorry if I'm sending you this email again, it's to the first one.
1031640	1034440	Oh, yeah, I didn't get the first one, sorry.
1034440	1040720	Okay, I thought it was a pretty clever comparison, the whole roster update versus the music games,
1040720	1045000	but I think for that it really depends on what you're into.
1045000	1051200	I don't hate sports games, I just recognize that that's not what I'm into, you know?
1051200	1057080	And I'm sure for most of them, maybe dance games isn't really what they're into, and
1057080	1062160	so they wouldn't recognize the fact that the new dance games do go through interface upgrades
1062160	1067160	and usually there's a new mode in them somewhere, and certainly the entire list of songs gets
1067160	1072080	refreshed with, in the beginning there were quite a few carryovers, but in the more recent
1072080	1075120	mixes, there's been very few carryovers, and so on and so on.
1075120	1080760	I'm not going to bore you to death with the comparisons, but it's an interesting analogy,
1080760	1086200	but I think us being fans of dance games, we don't see that, you or other sports games
1086200	1092360	fans being fans of sports games, you don't see that either, that the rest of us just
1092360	1093720	see the roster update or whatever.
1093720	1097540	Well, actually I think it's exactly the same thing, the fact that neither of the games
1097540	1104520	have huge improvements, granted sports games go through graphical improvements and roster
1104520	1110340	updates, but this is even coming from people reviewing the brand new EA lineup or whatever
1110340	1114340	that they aren't really adding anything new and it really just is a roster update.
1114340	1121100	But that's something that they need to improve in both dance games and sports games and probably
1121100	1130960	a lot of other games, like God of War 2, that looks like an update to God of War 1, a lot
1130960	1133360	of games are like that nowadays.
1133360	1137280	Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room has an interesting point, roster updates don't really change
1137280	1138920	the gameplay all too much.
1138920	1141760	New music and music games do change gameplay a bit.
1141760	1145380	You have to learn new steps and that sort to the new songs.
1145380	1152460	You don't really change much for roster updates, but even the sports games do get some new
1152460	1157700	modes for their respective games just once in a while, just like the dance games.
1157700	1162400	For instance, we know that in the new Xbox ones we're going to have the non-stop mixes,
1162400	1163400	things like that.
1163400	1165400	Alright, that's my thoughts.
1165400	1173080	Well, we also got another email from Rini and it's a fairly long one, so just to sort
1173080	1181200	of paraphrase of it, it's going into more innovation in the DDR series of games, but
1181200	1182200	I'm going to start from here.
1182200	1184680	Actually, I want to read the first one just because it was really nice.
1184680	1187920	Good day to OLR and happy belated episode 203.
1187920	1191320	May you have another 396 more at this point and beyond.
1191320	1194320	That was really sweet, thank you.
1194320	1199280	So to continue on toward the middle part of this letter, there was some discussion going
1199280	1204360	on in the Air and in Japan and DDR UK forums that was started to see what users had in
1204360	1208360	mind for some realistic and reasonable feature additions that could be added to DDR.
1208360	1213000	I'll try to make things brisk with a few suggestions made by the community.
1213000	1217900	Preview background mode and steps at the song wheel and maybe at the modifier screen.
1217900	1220640	Challenge steps for every song in the sense that they would not only give something for
1220640	1225200	expert players, but would also bring out the full potential of the song according to Konami
1225200	1230140	so that we don't have the boring as hell licenses from the arcade supernova that has gaps of
1230140	1232440	nothing for no reason.
1232440	1236920	Wave break 0.25 and half speed, why hasn't Konami put these in?
1236920	1241320	If UltraMix 3 allows 0.5 speed and Phantom modifiers, then why can't the PS2 versions
1241320	1242920	have them?
1242920	1249060	Custom courses set on a home version can be used at the arcade with the ability to include
1249060	1251760	any song available on the arcade machine.
1251760	1255200	Also should have a maximum of four songs on nonstop mode and allow modifiers and a max
1255200	1259640	of five songs on challenge mode that disallows modifiers for these courses.
1259640	1264560	Trade edit data online and at the arcade, submit arcade score data online through a
1264560	1267440	home version by way of memory card.
1267440	1271320	Those are some good suggestions.
1271320	1275200	They are good suggestions and certainly we've thought through the show, many years we've
1275200	1279840	been doing the show, a lot of you guys when you've called in said very similar things.
1279840	1283640	Keep in mind that another thing that maybe goes along with the last email, the whole
1283640	1287080	roster updates, something Konami seems to be doing with the DDR is that they really
1287080	1290040	try to make each one its own separate thing.
1290040	1294800	The Xbox DDRs and the PlayStation 2 DDRs are really separate, they're their own different
1294800	1295800	things.
1295800	1300000	It's interesting to see where the arcade versions fit in now with the whole...
1300000	1306520	I think Supernova for me feels more like a, is there a market for DDR again?
1306520	1307520	I don't know.
1307520	1311560	If Supernova is successful, I would think that maybe we're going to get another arcade
1311560	1312560	release.
1312560	1313560	I don't know.
1313560	1314560	I think either way it's inevitable.
1314560	1317800	We're going to see Supernova 2 or something like that next year because with the leftover
1317800	1321200	songs that you didn't get from the arcade this year at least, but we'll see.
1321200	1326680	I am going to put this one up on our site, but there is though a last paragraph on here.
1326680	1333820	By the way, the emails that I post are going to be on the live show discussion area on
1333820	1334820	our forums.
1334820	1338920	It says Implayboy can just get the fuck out with their pathetic excuse of a video game
1338920	1339920	related centerfold.
1339920	1345280	All the artistic offerings out there read hentai, beat the shit they have easily and
1345280	1348440	for free, although it is commendable that they get CG nudity, right?
1348440	1349440	P.S.
1349440	1350440	More goddamn ferret.
1350440	1353920	I actually heard that the CG nudity on it looked pretty crappy.
1353920	1358160	I did look at the final thing, well the final one that was post-ed, censored of course.
1358160	1361520	It wasn't that great.
1361520	1369560	Well it's Fake Boobs Implayboy, which is kind of a, you know, it's like money at the bank.
1369560	1370560	Exactly.
1370560	1375080	Well, to continue, the next one comes from JeremyTod1.
1375080	1378240	First off, you probably already got a couple of emails on the subject and probably aren't
1378240	1380920	even going to talk about it on the show, but here's my email.
1380920	1384280	O.L.R.'s enemy, G4, is finally mostly gone.
1384280	1390280	Yes, I know the words G4 are banned from O.L.R., but for now we might not need to talk about
1390280	1394400	them much anymore.
1394400	1398520	This is all I'm going to say on this because you're right, those words are banned from
1398520	1402160	this network.
1402160	1406680	I think a lot of people are saying it's definitely the doom and gloom of the network.
1406680	1411400	I think it's more the doom and gloom of the network as a gaming network because it's being
1411400	1416520	merged in with E-Networks, which also runs like the Style Channel and some other channels.
1416520	1421080	That doesn't mean the station's gone or merged into E yet, although I think that may be a
1421080	1423760	foregone conclusion that happens in the future.
1423760	1429840	But don't expect any gaming content outside of X-Play, but this is not news again.
1429840	1434000	That channel has not been a gaming channel for the past 18 months.
1434000	1435380	Where have you been?
1435380	1437720	This is still not news.
1437720	1438720	So what?
1438720	1440260	They're doing a corporate restructuring around there.
1440260	1441880	It's not going to save them.
1441880	1444760	Flush that shit down the toilet and be done with it.
1444760	1448240	There is a quote on here, though, that I knew it from the get-go.
1448240	1449940	I do agree with the vision.
1449940	1456800	This is actually a quote from the Ian-style chief, Ted Harbert.
1456800	1460960	I do agree with the vision of going after young men more than going after gaming.
1460960	1463600	Gaming has been demonstrated as being too narrow.
1463600	1465600	Narrow my ass!
1465600	1469080	There are a lot of gamers out there.
1469080	1472480	Text email, please.
1472480	1476840	No offense to the men listening and the men in the room, but stupid men.
1476840	1477840	Anyway.
1477840	1478840	Well.
1478840	1479920	I didn't mean you guys.
1479920	1484920	You guys are fairly liberated in your mental states, and so are our listeners.
1484920	1485920	Kisses.
1485920	1486920	Is that all the email?
1486920	1487920	No!
1487920	1488920	Well, then get to the next one.
1488920	1489920	We're out of time here.
1489920	1491920	Yeah, my voice is running out.
1491920	1495840	Hey, O-L-R. This, by the way, comes from Kenji.
1495840	1499600	So I just picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and I cannot emphasize this enough.
1499600	1503680	It is definitely a must-buy if you've got to hook up to the Wi-Fi connection.
1503680	1509020	Even though the bowling physics are awful, you can't go all-in, and you can bet yourself
1509020	1510960	out of a negative chip score.
1510960	1514080	Playing nine-ball is similar to playing the game underwater or in space.
1514080	1515080	Take your pick.
1515080	1517240	You can't deny the infinite replayability of this game.
1517240	1519860	Also, you can pick to chat via Wi-Fi.
1519860	1523120	It can only be, however, on matches with your friends, and, of course, you can pick to via
1523120	1526560	local wireless play and chat with your present messages on WorldFi Wi-Fi.
1526560	1528400	So DMN lied to us last week?
1528400	1531480	Of course, he had the game before most people.
1531480	1534320	He had the game before most people, so he probably didn't have friends on Wi-Fi yet,
1534320	1535320	so that makes sense.
1535320	1537320	That makes me want to buy the game, though.
1537320	1538320	Why?
1538320	1539320	Dirty Wi-Fi.
1539320	1540320	Dirty Wi-Fi chat?
1540320	1541320	Yeah.
1541320	1542320	That would be fun.
1542320	1545960	Anyway, it is because of the awesomeness of this game that I come to you with a request,
1545960	1546960	nay, a favor.
1546960	1551120	I wanted to make an OLR Clubhouse games night where we all exchange friend codes, make a
1551120	1553720	date and time, and basically play the night away.
1553720	1558080	Perhaps you'd all like to participate, you being Jamie, Sky, and Loki, and you also being
1558080	1560120	the rest of the people listening.
1560120	1566000	At long last, pick to chatting, drop 4 biatch can become a reality, but only with your help.
1566000	1568880	I've left a post in the forums for anyone who's interested, as I always love the show.
1568880	1569880	Kenji?
1569880	1572920	Just so you know, I did see that post earlier in the week, and I actually just moved it
1572920	1577080	to the OL Army forums because it's kind of fit a little more with that because we try
1577080	1581760	to create teams in certain games that will follow the cardinal rule of the OL Army is
1581760	1583320	don't be a dick.
1583320	1587000	So we just want people to join up that just want to have fun and not try to have that
1587000	1591080	elitist attitude or like, you know, my plus four sword can be your plus two, you know,
1591080	1592080	who cares?
1592080	1593080	Get in the game and have fun with it.
1593080	1594600	Put your plus four sword in your pants.
1594600	1595600	That's exactly right.
1595600	1599120	So I actually moved that post over to the OL Army and I posted my code there.
1599120	1604480	So if you want to add that would be cool and certainly we could set up a night for gaming.
1604480	1607880	Maybe it could be a tie in with one of the live shows that we do during the week because
1607880	1610880	a lot of people don't know there's shows we do on Orange Launch Radio, but we don't podcast
1610880	1613300	because, you know, we like to be a live radio network.
1613300	1617960	So Dark Sakura has her thing on Tuesdays and I have a show on Wednesdays and there may
1617960	1619800	be more shows coming soon.
1619800	1623620	We know Loki's got something in the works and there's something else I'm trying to get
1623620	1624620	on board.
1624620	1625620	We'll see.
1625620	1629800	We're coming from GS 191, we got a really long email, but I thought it was very cool
1629800	1634920	and have posted it on that thread that I mentioned prior on there.
1634920	1637120	So I'd love to get some discussion started up on that.
1637120	1638120	I will.
1638120	1640800	The other emails that I was going to post up to will be coming.
1640800	1644480	It's just been, like I said, I've had a sinus infection the last week, so I haven't really
1644480	1645480	done much of anything.
1645480	1646480	Excuses, excuses.
1646480	1647480	I'm kidding.
1647480	1648960	Would you like the sinus infection?
1648960	1649960	Not really.
1649960	1652260	I would love to see you on erythromycin.
1652260	1653260	Not really.
1653260	1654260	Okay.
1654260	1655780	Not erythromycin.
1655780	1659080	Just a, you know, he who shall not be named.
1659080	1660080	Anything else for emails?
1660080	1661080	Yes.
1661080	1663120	God damn, we got a lot of emails this week.
1663120	1664120	They love us.
1664120	1665120	One more.
1665120	1666120	Last email.
1666120	1667120	We got to keep moving.
1667120	1668120	Yes.
1668120	1669120	This is the one that came on through MySpace.
1669120	1670120	Ah, okay.
1670120	1671120	Yes.
1671120	1672120	I remember this one.
1672120	1673120	This is a MySpace message.
1673120	1674120	Gally from Breakdown Radio.
1674120	1675120	Mm-hmm.
1675120	1676120	Hey guys, Gally here from the Breakdown.
1676120	1678600	I'm a big fan of the show and you guys rock swords big time.
1678600	1682260	Sorry I didn't send this to your mailbag, but I think being yelled at by the boss right
1682260	1683600	now, damn the man.
1683600	1688160	Anyway, with all this talk of the Wii 60 going down, do you guys think it's a smart move
1688160	1689160	on a personal level?
1689160	1693180	Do you guys already have 360s, but try and look at it from the perspective of a gamer
1693180	1694960	who has neither yet?
1694960	1699800	Do you think it would be a wise move to do the Wii 60, stick with one of the two, or
1699800	1704200	is the last alternative, which I highly doubt because of Sakura's crayon eating references,
1704200	1705360	holding out for the PS3?
1705360	1709520	It seems a lot of gamers out there face that dilemma and we've been thinking this question
1709520	1710520	a lot from our listeners.
1710520	1714000	I'm sorry, we've been getting this question a lot from our listeners and peers.
1714000	1716640	So what do you think?
1716640	1720840	Okay, DarkSakura, please remind our listeners of the golden rule of gaming.
1720840	1723520	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1723520	1729400	Yes, and this is why I have her bring this up because it's really about what you want
1729400	1732160	out of this next generation of gaming.
1732160	1736860	If you're rich and are really into gaming and want to buy all three systems, hey, go
1736860	1737860	for it.
1737860	1738860	Get them all.
1738860	1743780	But if you are not rich and you only have the choice, you know, do I want to get a PS3
1743780	1747960	or do I want to do the Wii 60 thing, or hell, can I really only pick one of these?
1747960	1752240	You know, you really have to consider what games do you want to play.
1752240	1757960	And I think especially right now between Wii and Xbox 360, there's vastly different games
1757960	1762060	available on the two systems, so you really have to ask yourself, am I wanting to do the
1762060	1769200	wavy controller, Elibits, Zelda, WarioWare type of game, or do I want to get online and
1769200	1775720	play Gears of War and soon Halo 3 and maybe some, you know, games like Enchanted Arms
1775720	1779820	or NFL NBA type games that are available on Xbox 360?
1779820	1781800	You really have to consider.
1781800	1785320	And then the way PlayStation 3 works into it is that, you know, even though a lot of
1785320	1790000	games that, you know, we're hearing are kind of the same things we saw on Xbox 360, i.e.
1790000	1796640	Oblivion and so on, they are going to have their own games eventually that stand out.
1796640	1800600	My personal mindset is that you don't need to get a PlayStation 3 right out the gate,
1800600	1806960	but I say that because for me, there's no games on this yet that I have to have.
1806960	1809700	A year from now, I'm probably going to feel a lot differently.
1809700	1813600	By the time Final Fantasy 13, Metal Gear Solid 4 start hitting the market, you know what,
1813600	1815840	I'm probably going to be Sony fanboy all over again.
1815840	1818500	But as far as the launch goes, I'm not really sold.
1818500	1822780	So if you think you're going to have some money now and then more money in a year and
1822780	1826500	PlayStation 3 doesn't have the lineup for you right now, do what I'm doing.
1826500	1830880	Buy the Wii now so you have your Wii 6, because I bought the Xbox 360, you know, six months
1830880	1834240	ago so, you know, it's spaced out enough where this isn't a huge financial impact.
1834240	1837320	Buy the Wii when it comes out and then buy the PlayStation 3 later down the line.
1837320	1839960	But, you know, again, it's up to you and what games you want to play.
1839960	1841840	And there's no real clear answer we can give.
1841840	1843920	We can only tell you based on what we play.
1843920	1846780	But there's going to be Sony fanboys that say, no, you have to have one of these on
1846780	1853240	launch because you have to have Lair and Warhawk and Sixaxis for life and yadda, yadda, yadda.
1853240	1854680	But it's all about what you want.
1854680	1861360	Well, from my perspective, I'm getting them all anyway, so...
1861360	1863320	I'd say if you can get them all, get them all.
1863320	1866560	That way you're not limited.
1866560	1870080	ActDeaf says, I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'll get a 360 just to play
1870080	1871940	UNO.
1871940	1875200	You might be being sarcastic, but you're really wasting your time if that's all you want because
1875200	1879480	you can play it for free on Zone MSN, or, hell, Clubhouse Games has something just like
1879480	1880480	it.
1880480	1885600	So, if now you must have strip UNO with the webcam, well, I suppose a 360 is the only
1885600	1887600	place you could do that.
1887600	1888600	I don't know.
1888600	1891960	Rama says PlayStation 3 will be bringing it back to the store after it breaks in 20 minutes.
1891960	1893520	Hey, you know what?
1893520	1894880	That's something to be said too.
1894880	1897360	Maybe you don't want to get a first generation worth of console.
1897360	1899320	I learned my lesson with the Xbox 360.
1899320	1902840	Go back and listen to some episodes around February when I bought my Xbox 360.
1902840	1907280	The damn thing broke when I bought it, and I was pissed, and I was going to go torch
1907280	1912200	down Microsoft, but since then they fixed it for free, and I've been a happy boy.
1912200	1918560	I did also want to make an announcement, though, for Pump Up the Volume, actually, this week.
1918560	1919560	Your Tuesday show.
1919560	1920560	Yes.
1920560	1921560	Yes.
1921560	1922560	Excuse me.
1922560	1923560	There will be a delay on the show.
1923560	1926680	It will be starting around 730 to 8 this week.
1926680	1929320	I just wanted to go ahead and make a mention of that.
1929320	1930840	I am doing it.
1930840	1931840	All right.
1931840	1935080	Let's go ahead and listen to the other live programming on Orange Launch Radio.
1935080	1938800	All done with the mailbag?
1938800	1939800	Yeah.
1939800	1940800	Okay.
1940800	1943240	Moving on to more gaming news.
1943240	1948960	There is a movie called 8-Bit under development.
1948960	1953840	According to VH1's Game Break, quote, this movie is about how games affect our culture,
1953840	1957820	how the genre crosses the culture to influence music, art, and the way we think.
1957820	1962160	In 8-Bit, artists invade the online shooter Counter-Strike to add messages of peace on
1962160	1965580	walls with paintball guns if they don't get shot first.
1965580	1970640	In 8-Bit, people make compelling trance club and even pop-focus music using old Game Boys.
1970640	1975200	In 8-Bit, artists Mary Flanagan's take the software from Unreal Tournament 2003 to make
1975200	1980560	Domestik, a memorous world in which she tells a story about how her father was trapped in
1980560	1982320	the family's house during a fire.
1982320	1984400	It's amazing stuff all the way around.
1984400	1985400	Huh.
1985400	1986400	Sounds kind of artsy.
1986400	1989920	That might be interesting.
1989920	1991480	It's kind of weird that I've never heard of any of this stuff.
1991480	1993140	Well, I mean, I've heard of the music, certainly.
1993140	1996040	We know a lot of those bands, but I haven't heard of any of those other art projects,
1996040	1997200	so that might be worth checking out.
1997200	1998200	I've heard of the Game Boy one.
1998200	1999200	Really?
1999200	2000200	Well, yeah, yeah.
2000200	2001200	The Game Boy music one.
2001200	2002200	Yeah.
2002200	2004200	We've also had bands that use the type of...
2004200	2005200	Yeah.
2005200	2008680	I'm talking about like the Counter-Strike, Grandpa and the fire thing and the whole...
2008680	2009680	Those sort of things.
2009680	2010680	I've never heard of that before.
2010680	2012440	That might be interesting.
2012440	2019320	Bringing paintballs into a wall does not make for a winning team, but it's an interesting
2019320	2022160	kind of art form when it's done in a game, huh?
2022160	2023160	Maybe?
2023160	2024160	Yeah.
2024160	2029040	It's very unique, but it's also kind of neat, and one of the rumors that's going to be coming
2029040	2034960	soon, and you might actually be able to watch 8-bit on this, that Microsoft might be adding
2034960	2040040	XVID and DivX support to the 360 in the fall dashboard update.
2040040	2048680	Now, no idea whether it's true or not, but the news actually comes from a developers
2048680	2053720	conference that was going on, actually.
2053720	2063920	Some Dutch colleagues from xLife.nl were invited to a training session for shop employees and
2063920	2068920	basically kind of just talking a little bit about technology and stuff.
2068920	2074200	One of the questions that was asked, basically at the event, they had a talk with the host
2074200	2079000	and asked them whether it was going to be DivX or XVID support in the future or other
2079000	2083160	codecs, and he said that it was something that Microsoft was working hard to implement,
2083160	2088320	and a firmware update is expected within two months.
2088320	2089320	We'll have to see.
2089320	2094360	That might be a rumor for now, but it would make sense if they supported something like
2094360	2095360	that.
2095360	2097100	I don't know if they will, though.
2097100	2104400	Something that's not a rumor is a new multiplayer mode for Red Steel is going to be called Killer
2104400	2105400	Mode.
2105400	2112320	It's a special multiplayer setup, so you'll use your mission brief via the speaker and
2112320	2113320	the Wiimote.
2113320	2121360	I was hearing something about this, that basically, I think the Wiimote is supposed to ring, and
2121360	2125160	so you put it up to your ear and it'll actually whisper like, you know...
2125160	2126160	This is Snake.
2126160	2130640	This isn't like, you need to kill player four and do not kill the other players or something
2130640	2131640	like that.
2131640	2134520	It gives you your mission in a little speaker so the other people don't know what your mission
2134520	2135520	is.
2135520	2136520	That's pretty cool.
2136520	2137520	That is damn innovative, isn't it?
2137520	2138520	That's pretty fun.
2138520	2139520	I like that.
2139520	2140520	That is pretty cool.
2140520	2141520	That's innovation.
2141520	2145100	I like that.
2145100	2146960	This might be innovative as well for the Wii.
2146960	2149140	The Wii might just be this system of innovation.
2149140	2155020	That's certainly the direction that Nintendo wanted to go in, whether the public is open
2155020	2156240	to that or not.
2156240	2158440	I'm not quite sure.
2158440	2166920	The rumor is that a Wii is going to go into digital distribution in 2007.
2166920	2170520	What they're actually doing, they're talking about service, I think it's going to be very
2170520	2175840	similar to Xbox Live Arcade, and they kind of touched on this a little bit during E3,
2175840	2184640	saying that they're going to be helping finance certain smaller games for the Wii marketplace.
2184640	2187040	This I think is going to be very similar to that.
2187040	2190920	They're going to be talking a little bit more about releasing games.
2190920	2194880	You see some of the stuff, not necessarily old games on Xbox Live Arcade, but newer games
2194880	2197520	that are small made for that kind of setup.
2197520	2202760	I don't see this really replacing the current distribution we have now, but it's interesting
2202760	2207160	because you've heard a lot of talk about this whole digital distribution moving on into
2207160	2210440	the next gaming area, especially on PlayStation 3 as well.
2210440	2211440	There's a quote here.
2211440	2212840	Let me read this real fast.
2212840	2216600	This is from, I believe this is from Nintendo themselves.
2216600	2221060	Beginning in spring 2007, Nintendo will apparently begin the Wii Compact software line of games
2221060	2225600	which will allow players to download certain Wii titles to their console rather than purchasing
2225600	2226600	a disc.
2226600	2230120	Pricing and storage details as well as what software will be made available, not provided.
2230120	2234140	Yeah, it's going to be very interesting on the storage details because it doesn't really
2234140	2238040	have much storage in that system, only 512.
2238040	2239840	I'm sure there will be an external.
2239840	2243120	If there's a peripheral to be made, Nintendo's on it.
2243120	2244120	Definitely.
2244120	2245880	It was actually kind of interesting.
2245880	2249880	They had some pics from the new peripherals that were announced for Japan, and we got
2249880	2253640	to see a picture of the Ethernet adapter for the Wii.
2253640	2260040	It's just USB Ethernet, which is kind of cool, and new cables and whatnot.
2260040	2266080	So, anyways, there's some interesting stuff also coming out about the Wii, and I know
2266080	2270600	one of the stories that was run during the week when talking about how sunlight was causing
2270600	2276320	a problem with the Wiim remotes, where it was interfering with the IR field that the
2276320	2281040	actual receiver and emitters were putting out.
2281040	2285640	Well, apparently, Nintendo has commented on that, and they said that it's not a major
2285640	2286640	issue.
2286640	2290040	It says, our testing thus far shows no great risk of light interference while playing a
2290040	2293580	game that relies on the pointer and sensor bar.
2293580	2299600	And so, granted, that's going to be about as much interference as having a bright light
2299600	2304840	shining on your TV or something like that, that won't really interfere with it.
2304840	2307280	I'm kind of on the fence with this.
2307280	2309400	I guess we'll have to see when it comes out.
2309400	2310400	But you know what, though?
2310400	2317000	If there's anything to be learned from this, especially from the iToy and from the Xbox
2317000	2322080	Live Vision camera, my house is always too dark, so I don't think too much light is ever
2322080	2324080	going to be a problem.
2352080	2357160	She serves the internet up and down and left and right, and finds a website that she finds
2357160	2359360	worthy of sharing with you all.
2359360	2363880	It's called her Website of the Week, and here it is.
2363880	2369760	This Website of the Week was actually one given to me by our dear friend and listener,
2369760	2374360	Rob with Two Bees, and I'll spell it out.
2374360	2382200	It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com, which is for the Entertainment Consumers Association, which
2382200	2384000	is actually very cool.
2384000	2389480	To read this little blurb from their website, the Entertainment Consumers Association is
2389480	2393800	a non-profit membership organization established to serve the needs of those who play computer
2393800	2395800	and video games.
2395800	2402520	Formed in 2006, the ECA is an advocacy organization for consumers of interactive entertainment.
2402520	2404080	You can actually sign up for their site.
2404080	2405160	They have things to win.
2405160	2409680	They also have lots of information, links to game politics, too.
2409680	2414080	It seems that there's a little bit of an affiliation there.
2414080	2419480	Lots of really good stuff, FAQs, news, just things that are going on as far as our legal
2419480	2420800	rights as gamers.
2420800	2423960	In fact, there's another blurb on here.
2423960	2428120	It says, today more than ever before, gamers need to stand together to defend against political
2428120	2432780	activity that is threatening the creation and publishing of video games.
2432780	2437500	On behalf of the gaming community, the ECA lobbies legislators directly as well as launching
2437500	2441160	grassroots digital initiatives to preserve our rights as gamers.
2441160	2443160	What was that link again?
2443160	2447900	It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com.
2447900	2448900	Check it out, boys and girls.
2448900	2449900	Definitely.
2449900	2453560	I'll be linking it in the chat room.
2453560	2456480	GameTap is a service we've mentioned a few times on this show.
2456480	2460880	It's still getting a little steam, a few more subscribers every now and then.
2460880	2467120	They have launched a 500 player beta of Uru Live, which you might know also as the missed
2467120	2468800	online project.
2468800	2472680	This is a pretty big deal because what happened is the project was abandoned and then GameTap
2472680	2476680	has kind of picked it up and ran with it, so it's kind of interesting.
2476680	2481440	Gay Gamer recently ran a report on this and they said this, quote, GameTap has improved
2481440	2485000	the game with new sound support and a new physics engine that makes it much easier and
2485000	2488880	faster to interact with others, something that bogged down the original game.
2488880	2493480	As things go as planned, Uru Live may begin to incorporate content generated by its incredibly
2493480	2495080	creative player community.
2495080	2496080	Interesting.
2496080	2497080	That's pretty cool.
2497080	2501640	I hope they keep doing more stuff like that, supporting smaller games, maybe helping some
2501640	2503520	PC games get published and stuff like that.
2503520	2506720	I think what's kind of neat about that, too, is that you're paying essentially the GameTap
2506720	2510120	fee for access to all this, so if they get more MMOs, it's kind of like you're paying
2510120	2514320	one fee for all these MMOs, and GameTap is relatively cheap.
2514320	2518160	It's the same price they're charging for Phantasy Star Universe, in a way.
2518160	2520600	I don't want to sound like a commercial because I've already been accused of being on their
2520600	2521600	payroll.
2521600	2527840	No, I actually pay the $10 a month for GameTap, which is sad because I rarely ever use it
2527840	2533540	because I check it out once every other week or so to see what's new.
2533540	2535640	This is something I definitely will check out.
2535640	2536640	I'm very curious.
2536640	2541600	Obviously, I can't get it in the beta, but when it's released.
2541600	2548500	This week, Unfettered Blather, a blogging site, actually ran a top ten list of the top
2548500	2553800	ten things about next-gen that are annoying.
2553800	2555840	Let's go off the list here.
2555840	2557040	Big highlights, of course.
2557040	2560200	Number one, Sony's alternate reality.
2560200	2563520	No matter how you spin it, we just want a game console first.
2563520	2566300	Go push your format war somewhere else.
2566300	2570080	Number two, dual-price skew nonsense with the new next-gen console.
2570080	2571580	You know what, though?
2571580	2575120	If you read those stories about people who are pre-ordering the PS3, some of them were
2575120	2577040	doing it because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.
2577040	2580560	I don't know if number one has as much validity as people think.
2580560	2581560	I don't know.
2581560	2585200	Anyways, cost between consoles and computers vanishing.
2585200	2590200	$60 games, expensive peripherals, consoles being released at $600 price points.
2590200	2596520	Chasing Nintendo, since you just can't ignore the changes in industry, but sure fun watching
2596520	2601920	these two mega-corporations scramble to keep up with Nintendo's ideas.
2601920	2608040	And other fun stuff, they're also on there, mainly repeating the $60 game thing and name
2608040	2612120	changes like they're saying the revolution was a better name and stuff like that.
2612120	2614440	That $60 game thing should have been number one.
2614440	2616500	That's the most annoying, if anything.
2616500	2617500	Come on.
2617500	2618500	$60 bucks.
2618500	2620080	My game would have made my list.
2620080	2622000	Yeah, we haven't really seen it.
2622000	2625020	That whole Gran Turismo thing, though, I don't think we've really seen what exactly
2625020	2627600	is going to come of that, you know what I mean?
2627600	2628600	Interesting.
2628600	2629600	All right.
2629600	2634360	Well, if you have more annoying things, you could maybe write this guy and maybe he'll
2634360	2636880	do an extended list in the future.
2636880	2643840	Well, in other news, in regards to, we had brought up there was going to be a Castlevania
2643840	2645840	movie, right?
2645840	2649960	Well, it's going to be written by Warren Ellis.
2649960	2650960	Pretty cool, huh?
2650960	2655600	But also, it is going to be direct to DVD.
2655600	2657640	I don't know.
2657640	2659400	Direct to DVD, that's not good.
2659400	2662080	There have been some good things put direct to DVD.
2662080	2664680	Well, it kind of seems to be one place the movie industry is going.
2664680	2667400	You have all these god-awful sequels going direct to DVD.
2667400	2673440	Why not something kind of new, unique, unless you saw Van Helsing, which was kind of Castlevania
2673440	2675200	the movie in a way.
2675200	2676200	Not really.
2676200	2677200	Just kidding.
2677200	2683320	At any rate, there's a quote on here saying, for an entity currently known only as Project
2683320	2690800	51 Productions, a production blog will follow on the official site.
2690800	2693640	We just keep our eyes on it to see what happens.
2693640	2694640	All right.
2694640	2696360	Well, I'm looking for it.
2696360	2697360	I'll rent it.
2697360	2698760	I'll put it in my Netflix queue.
2698760	2702480	Having him write it, that's like a fan-gasm right there.
2702480	2704480	I don't know.
2704480	2708520	By the way, it is the animated Castlevania thing that we were talking about before.
2708520	2713220	So animated movie, that wouldn't be too bad, I guess, and this is not live action.
2713220	2714880	After all, they are making BloodRayne 2.
2714880	2719600	I mean, god, do we really need more video game movies like that, but I don't know.
2719600	2721240	It should be pretty cool.
2721240	2723720	Okay, here we go.
2723720	2727520	He basically was a comic writer.
2727520	2731440	I actually did remember that he did work for Excalibur because I read Excalibur from its
2731440	2739440	beginning incarnation and on, did DV8, which was a Gen 13 spinoff, Stormwatch.
2739440	2745960	The Authority did some stuff for Vertigo, Transmetropolitan was one.
2745960	2755080	Also was working on the Counter-X line of titles for Marvel, as in Generation X, X-Man,
2755080	2764960	X-Force, and is also working on Avatar comics, Homage comics, lots of different comic stuff.
2764960	2766160	I just had to pull up the list.
2766160	2768000	I knew Excalibur off the top of my head.
2768000	2771880	Comic fan-gasm for those folks that are looking forward to the Castlevania movie.
2771880	2775000	I always remembered the Excalibur stuff, but I knew he did a whole bunch of other things
2775000	2776000	too.
2776000	2779720	Well, another animated thing that's very popular is South Park, and of course, a couple of
2779720	2781320	weeks ago, they had the Wow episode.
2781320	2786360	Well, man, you should have kept a tab on Wikipedia because people just started coming up with
2786360	2791360	these huge lists of things that were inconsistent in the episode.
2791360	2795160	I mean, obviously, these were the same guys that Matt and Trey were trying to make fun
2795160	2796160	of.
2796160	2798320	For instance, here's one.
2798320	2801780	Trailers for this episode show Stan and Kyle in what appears to be the undercity right
2801780	2803140	after Kenny is killed.
2803140	2804840	In the airing of the show, they were in Goldshire.
2804840	2811440	I mean, it's like, damn, people, get a life.
2811440	2815220	But I do want to point out, I watched this week's episode of South Park, and for those
2815220	2819480	folks that heard my review of the Wow episode of South Park last week, that satire I said
2819480	2821720	was missing, that was in this week's episode.
2821720	2823840	This week's episode of South Park was freaking hilarious.
2823840	2828600	I laughed my ass off, but I just have a fucked-up sense of humor.
2828600	2829600	What can I say?
2829600	2833200	Don't you think that they probably did that stuff on purpose or just didn't really give
2833200	2834200	a crap?
2834200	2835200	That's what they did.
2835200	2836200	Ah, bathroom.
2836200	2841120	So then there's another wonderful rumor going around the interweb this week.
2841120	2846520	That would be that the sword featured in the actual episode of South Park was a real sword.
2846520	2854280	Sword of the 1000 Truths is supposed to be winnable in the arena matches in Burning Crusade.
2854280	2860240	Some people think that it's an obvious Photoshop, but who knows, I guess we'll see when Burning
2860240	2863440	Crusade hits stores.
2863440	2865960	That's kind of interesting though.
2865960	2867880	It actually wouldn't surprise me if that were true.
2867880	2869720	I actually don't think that's a fanboy thing.
2869720	2873960	I think that could actually be true because that episode of South Park felt like such
2873960	2878000	this huge infomercial, it would be the perfect tie-in.
2878000	2881520	Well it was funny though, because actually some of the stats were a little bit different
2881520	2885400	from the actual cartoon.
2885400	2895840	Of course it says 197 to 296 damage, 88 damage per second, plus 21 stamina, requires level
2895840	2896840	70.
2896840	2901520	It says equip improves hit rating by 8, improves critical strike rating by 14, and improves
2901520	2902520	your resub.
2902520	2904120	Why don't you go post that on Wikipedia, you damn nerd?
2904120	2906120	It doesn't match what was in the show.
2906120	2908000	No, they already posted that on Wikipedia.
2908000	2909600	Oh, I see.
2909600	2914920	So that would be interesting to see if that's going to actually be coming out.
2914920	2919600	Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, looks like those wow nerds during the correcting needs a clue.
2919600	2920600	I got a clue.
2920600	2921600	I got a raging clue.
2921600	2922880	My clue is over there.
2922880	2923880	Let's go there.
2923880	2924880	Oh my, ClueGoo.
2924880	2925880	ClueGoo.
2925880	2926880	That's a raging clue.
2926880	2927880	I get it.
2927880	2930320	It's a joke about the South Park from this week.
2930320	2931320	That's funny.
2931320	2932320	Good job, listeners.
2932320	2933320	Good job.
2933320	2935320	Geeky, geeky, geeky, geeky.
2935320	2937240	Yeah, well, you know what?
2937240	2940840	You are on an internet radio program about video games.
2940840	2941840	Hi.
2941840	2942840	Hi, you're black.
2942840	2944560	Hey, hey, hey.
2944560	2947280	I calls them as I sees them, dude.
2947280	2954400	Well, you remember my allusion to the Phantom earlier in part A?
2954400	2955400	Yes.
2955400	2956400	Aha.
2956400	2957400	Pay attention, listeners.
2957400	2959320	Well, I was giving foreshadowing.
2959320	2960320	Ooh.
2960320	2964400	Yeah, they actually are starting to sell something for Phantom.
2964400	2966760	Isn't that funny?
2966760	2971280	They have been showing off this thing called the Phantom wireless lap board and Phantom
2971280	2974320	wireless laser mouse.
2974320	2979640	The two together are basically just a way to sit on your ass and browse the internet
2979640	2980640	with a keyboard.
2980640	2988320	It's like Web TV, only with a swivel keyboard thing and a piece of hard plastic underneath
2988320	2989320	it.
2989320	2990860	So is this the next generation of gaming?
2990860	2993360	My ass.
2993360	2996920	Like I said, Web TV, we've had this shit before.
2996920	3000120	But I...
3000120	3001120	Hard surface.
3001120	3002120	Was that funny, Loki?
3002120	3003120	No, I'm sorry.
3003120	3010280	I was just reading our chat room, and Black Boy's like, I have a blue kettle.
3010280	3011820	My kettle's silver.
3011820	3015340	There was a comment made in chat room to what I had said earlier, and I asked Black Boy
3015340	3019640	if his kettle was black, and he said it's actually blue.
3019640	3026120	The Get Well Gamers Foundation, it's another nice charity that was posted about a little
3026120	3029760	bit earlier this week on gaygamer.net.
3029760	3034400	Our next step is to see that we have product donations to support our new increased capacity.
3034400	3038760	At the moment, we have nowhere near what is required, but given our track record of success,
3038760	3041080	we are confident that someone will answer the call.
3041080	3045220	With the holidays fast approaching, however, it's crucial that we receive donations as
3045220	3046760	soon as possible.
3046760	3048880	Now what is it that they're donating to?
3048880	3054040	Very similar to the whole Penny Arcade deal that they do, these guys help donate video
3054040	3057160	games and game systems and things to children.
3057160	3059420	So that's pretty cool.
3059420	3064980	And this is a pretty cool thing, is that you can actually donate your old games, so games
3064980	3068060	you might think are old and outdated and you're never going to play anymore, like instead
3068060	3073080	of throwing a Nintendo 64 in the garbage, you could donate it to a charity like this.
3073080	3077920	And listen, if you've watched, fucking, Mind Mancia, you would know that nobody wants
3077920	3079520	a Nintendo 64 anymore.
3079520	3085280	I would just like to point out, in this picture, on this site, there is a child, a sick child,
3085280	3086440	you're playing a Nintendo 64.
3086440	3087440	Hasn't he suffered enough?
3087440	3089520	He suffered an heartless bastard.
3089520	3093800	Hey, hey, I still love Pokemon Snap.
3093800	3094800	Me too.
3094800	3097320	And Mario 64 is the shit.
3097320	3099440	I also threw away a PlayStation.
3099440	3101440	Well, I've done that.
3101440	3103560	I have a stack of five of them in my back room.
3103560	3105040	You hurtless, both of you.
3105040	3106040	They don't work.
3106040	3107040	Oh, come on.
3107040	3108040	If it's broken, then it's broken.
3108040	3114880	One of our old ones, it will still sort of work, you have to tilt it sideways at a 45
3114880	3117400	degree angle for it to read the discs right.
3117400	3118400	Maybe I'll donate mine to this charity.
3118400	3120400	I don't really play my Nintendo 64.
3120400	3124080	My Nintendo 64 was broken, it was all blurry, and the polygons were simple.
3124080	3125080	See, now you're making it up.
3125080	3127080	Now you're just making stuff up.
3127080	3130880	If I'm going to play Nintendo 64, I'll play my DS.
3130880	3131880	Exactly.
3131880	3133840	Anyway, just admit you're a bad person and get to the next story.
3133840	3137400	I am a bad person, and I have no problem with that.
3137400	3139800	You're a bad, bad man.
3139800	3145160	Listen, if it comes, I'm getting my Wii, and I ain't donating shit.
3145160	3146560	That's my Wii.
3146560	3147560	You're going to-
3147560	3148560	Whatever.
3148560	3149560	I'm not going to say any more.
3149560	3150560	Anyways-
3150560	3151560	You're going to get cancer.
3151560	3152560	That's just what's going to happen.
3152560	3153560	It's karma.
3153560	3154560	You're going to die in a fire.
3154560	3157560	Well, they all have a Nintendo 64 again.
3157560	3158560	The circle comes full.
3158560	3161280	You know you really want a 64 double D?
3161280	3162280	What?
3162280	3165480	I think we really need to go to the next story at this point before we get this-
3165480	3170560	Okay, look, we've got one foot in hell, so let's please go to the next story.
3170560	3175360	Anyways, because in hell, if you throw water on the ground, you're going to get steam.
3175360	3176360	That's my transition.
3176360	3181320	Because steam is getting a lot more cool games coming to it.
3181320	3185760	One of those games is a fan favorite, Psychonauts.
3185760	3190420	That's kind of neat, and of course, other things that you're going to be seeing on steam
3190420	3197120	other than Psychonauts, and Psychonauts, by the way, is just going to be about 20 bucks.
3197120	3201520	You're also going to see such wonderful games like Call of Duty 2, as well as some other
3201520	3206880	Activision titles, Call of Duty United Offensive, and Gun.
3206880	3210360	Those are also going to be coming, as well as the brand new game that will also be coming
3210360	3218120	to Xbox Live Arcade someday, RoboBlitz is also making its way, so lots of fun stuff
3218120	3219120	for steam.
3219120	3223240	They should do a game called Call of Booty.
3223240	3224480	Or porn.
3224480	3227920	You know, they have World of Porncraft.
3227920	3229680	They should definitely have Call of Booty.
3229680	3231680	Well speaking of World of...
3231680	3232680	You know what?
3232680	3233680	I should...
3233680	3234680	Okay.
3234680	3237320	I have this great entrepreneur idea here.
3237320	3238320	Would this sell?
3238320	3240280	That we're going to share with the entire internet.
3240280	3241280	I don't know.
3241280	3242280	Patent pending.
3242280	3243280	It's mine.
3243280	3244280	Trademarked.
3244280	3245280	You steal this, I sue you.
3245280	3246640	Okay, here it is.
3246640	3253340	Make a porn company that does nothing but video game tie-ins like that.
3253340	3256200	I think there's an audience out there for that.
3256200	3260720	We could do both gay, straight, lesbo, whatever, everything, trisexual, it doesn't matter,
3260720	3264160	furries, sure, we'll find something for you guys too, Pokemon or something.
3264160	3268000	I believe like Banjo-Kazooie porn.
3268000	3272600	Because think about it, there are movie studios that make their porns based off of movies.
3272600	3275080	The first one I ever saw was called The Boneheads.
3275080	3278360	The first one I ever saw was Whore of the Rings, actually that wasn't the first one.
3278360	3279360	Remember Ally McPheil?
3279360	3280360	That one was funny.
3280360	3285920	Ally McPheil with Ron Jeremy, okay see, these porn studios make killings off of...
3285920	3288520	off of TV spoofs and movie spoofs.
3288520	3293520	How about video game spoofs and Final Fuck X?
3293520	3294640	Who doesn't remember that one?
3294640	3296320	That was a great Japanese import.
3296320	3298320	We need some good, domestically made...
3298320	3299320	Really good cosplay.
3299320	3304360	Bring me your whores and your sluts and let's put them in some video game porn.
3304360	3308100	I'll make them stars and make a lot of money in the process.
3308100	3312040	Remember strippers are people too, naked people.
3312040	3316680	Anyway, next story, right?
3316680	3319320	Back to the world of something craft.
3319320	3324540	Well, you know how everyone was all hyper about the character transfer system for World
3324540	3325540	of Warcraft?
3325540	3330280	Well, apparently it sucks a lot of ass.
3330280	3338680	There's an article up on Kotaku that was written by someone who experienced this ass-ness firsthand.
3338680	3342680	They're actually going through it saying that he offered a... what?
3342680	3345320	Sorry, it's the chat room.
3345320	3346560	Finish your story, then I'll go back.
3346560	3347560	No, just tell me.
3347560	3348560	Because now there's...
3348560	3352240	Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls, I saw that at a store last week.
3352240	3355720	Now they're going off on all these movies that we could make here.
3355720	3363260	We have DMN says Super Princess Penis, DMN says Conquers Bad Furry Day, Mantic says Crash
3363260	3367600	Bandicunt, DMN says Elite Beat Off Agents.
3367600	3368600	You guys are brilliant.
3368600	3369600	I love it.
3369600	3372760	And Bandit says simply Paris Hilton's Gem Quest.
3372760	3375560	That's practically porn anyway.
3375560	3376560	You guys are awesome.
3376560	3382280	Well, back to my story, our dirty-minded listeners.
3382280	3383280	Chrome Horse.
3383280	3384280	That was...
3384280	3385280	Good one, Travis.
3385280	3386280	Travis, yeah.
3386280	3387280	Anyway...
3387280	3388280	Yeah, no more porn.
3388280	3389280	No more porn.
3389280	3390280	Sorry.
3390280	3395040	They finished the first step of the character transfer and paid everything on the credit
3395040	3396240	card.
3396240	3398240	They said it would take 12 hours to move it.
3398240	3399240	They checked again.
3399240	3400240	12 hours again.
3400240	3404160	12 hours later, they checked again, and still another 12 hours.
3404160	3408200	And people on the forums were bitching up a storm.
3408200	3413680	And actually, there was a...
3413680	3417640	They were basically putting the same old cut and paste response on the forum.
3417640	3418640	Blah, blah, blah.
3418640	3419640	This is normal.
3419640	3420640	Working as intended.
3420640	3421640	My butt.
3421640	3423240	You know, that type of thing.
3423240	3430200	And they said no one could resolve it by working with their customer service.
3430200	3434880	It was suggested canceling the transfer and starting again, and no one else had any luck
3434880	3436320	with it.
3436320	3441120	So they actually checked it.
3441120	3442120	Checked it.
3442120	3443120	Nothing was going through.
3443120	3448280	And they actually didn't bill, though, the credit card, you said, later, but there was
3448280	3453680	an issue, though, with people who were using debit cards saying that the transfer would
3453680	3459600	fail at the finalization stage and charge the account 20 euros for each failed attempt.
3459600	3463400	And it was redoing it over and over and over.
3463400	3468040	So they encouraged them to retry it, yet it was withdrawing 20 euros every time.
3468040	3470320	It looks like it was retrying it on its own.
3470320	3471320	Oh, nice.
3471320	3477260	So it wasn't charging credit cards, like I said, but it was charging debit accounts and
3477260	3481120	draining people's bank accounts.
3481120	3490960	So Blizzard hasn't worked for about eight days, and Blizzard finally came out and said
3490960	3491960	something about it.
3491960	3497680	But there has not been a statement issued by Blizzard.
3497680	3501780	There hasn't been an ETA as to when they're going to get that fixed.
3501780	3506200	As I understand it, though, this is only screwing over the euro banks, not American transfers.
3506200	3514480	That's what I'm seeing right here, but they can't just be so closed-mouthed about this.
3514480	3516560	They have to be ford with it.
3516560	3519800	They're going to lose so much freaking business.
3519800	3524060	On top of that, there's any type of number of suits that are going to come up over just
3524060	3526880	how much money they've taken from these bank accounts.
3526880	3531360	They've really screwed themselves with this.
3531360	3535040	When you see it happening, you stop the service.
3535040	3536600	You do it right then.
3536600	3538680	It's just ridiculous.
3538680	3539720	Not cool, not cool.
3539720	3544240	Hopefully there will be some type of compensation or free time given.
3544240	3545240	No free time.
3545240	3546240	They have to give these people their money back.
3546240	3550140	Well, that too, obviously, but something else for their troubles.
3550140	3552320	It's no fun having a dry bank account for a few days.
3552320	3554200	Trust me, I've been there.
3554200	3560320	At least the banks have been freezing the accounts that are in question.
3560320	3561320	That's good.
3561320	3566160	Dark Sakura, would you watch a movie called Select Caliber 3?
3566160	3570680	Hell yeah!
3570680	3573240	Black Boy says, Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll.
3573240	3574240	That sounds fun.
3574240	3577440	I thought there was a game, Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll.
3577440	3578640	Yeah, but it could be a porn too.
3578640	3583240	Sorry, I promised we wouldn't do any more of the porn, but some of them are just so
3583240	3584240	damn funny.
3584240	3585240	What can I say?
3585240	3587280	Skype line's open.
3587280	3588280	You can call us.
3588280	3589640	Go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
3589640	3590800	Click on interact with us.
3590800	3597960	The user name is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can pick up the telephone and call, 916-226-9067.
3597960	3601360	In the meantime, some quick last minute stories, some things to squeeze in there.
3601360	3603260	I did want to mention this.
3603260	3608880	If you're a fan of the game In the Groove, you can now, with this latest update they've
3608880	3613280	done on the machine, you can do your own custom MP3s and steps.
3613280	3618760	So basically, In the Groove has basically come out and legitimized itself as Step Mania
3618760	3619760	in the arcade.
3619760	3621520	There's only one problem though.
3621520	3626520	What are they going to do for audio licensing since I'm sure they didn't address that since
3626520	3633800	the game is not licensed on the machine and usually the machine will cover the licensing
3633800	3638280	for the songs that are in the game, but now that place, say if the RIA comes in and hears
3638280	3643000	someone playing Christina Aguilera or something like that on the machine, they could sue them.
3643000	3645960	Sorry, Chatham is correcting me and saying it's actually OGG files.
3645960	3646960	We are starting to get some calls.
3646960	3647960	We'll come back to this in a minute.
3647960	3648960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3648960	3649960	Who's this?
3649960	3650960	Hi.
3650960	3651960	This is Sephiroth1215 here.
3651960	3653960	Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.
3653960	3656600	What's on your mind?
3656600	3660560	I'm pretty much fresh off of Digital Life.
3660560	3662080	How is Digital Life?
3662080	3665320	Tell us a little bit about this.
3665320	3667640	The first time you get in there, it looks kind of cool.
3667640	3669140	It's nice and big.
3669140	3672800	So much to see, but it's really not that great this year.
3672800	3673800	Really?
3673800	3675900	Why is that?
3675900	3678880	You had some good things.
3678880	3683880	Maybe a few gaming booths, depending on what you like, though.
3683880	3686880	Now Digital Life is not exclusively a gaming show, right?
3686880	3688480	There's lots of stuff there.
3688480	3693480	No, there's plenty of stuff there.
3693480	3701480	Probably a lot of the space, though, was from MLG and another gaming league of some sort.
3701480	3704880	Was Sony the best booth there?
3704880	3708840	Sony's booth was kind of small, not to mention it was right next to Microsoft's booth.
3708840	3709840	Really?
3709840	3712560	Did you get your hands on the plate?
3712560	3717100	I got to play the PS3.
3717100	3720040	It played very well from what I got to see.
3720040	3722720	It played a little bit of Resistance.
3722720	3726520	Okay, that's something that didn't have an E3, I don't think, right?
3726520	3728760	What did you think of it?
3728760	3729760	It was good.
3729760	3735840	I was more so looking at the graphics and the movements of the characters more so than
3735840	3736840	the gameplay, though.
3736840	3738020	What do you think?
3738020	3743120	Did this sell you on the game, or on the system, I should say?
3743120	3750280	It proved to me that the system can be more solid than I originally thought, because I
3750280	3755760	thought maybe everything was going to be kind of blocky, or it wasn't...
3755760	3759040	I don't know how to explain it, really.
3759040	3765680	But I guess just to compare, I got to play the Wii a bit, and I played Elibits, and oddly
3765680	3767400	enough there were problems playing that.
3767400	3769360	Oh, what kind of problems?
3769360	3776240	The controls were off, I mean, you had to stay to the left, and it had the same kind
3776240	3781800	of problem that Sonic did, where you go a little bit and the cursor goes far off into
3781800	3782800	the screen.
3782800	3785440	Was it just maybe miscalibrated?
3785440	3787640	It might have been, I'm not quite sure.
3787640	3795960	It was only a demo of the game, so it could change later, not to mention the loading time
3795960	3799760	was way over a minute, just to even start the demo.
3799760	3806200	Hmm, wow, so that's interesting, kind of a different reaction than we heard from E3,
3806200	3809920	where everybody was buzzing about the Wii and not so buzzing about the PS3.
3809920	3812720	What do you think was the best thing you saw at Digital Life?
3812720	3817800	Honestly, the best thing at Digital Life was the DDR booth, which is where I was working
3817800	3819120	all weekend.
3819120	3822440	What was there, what was at the DDR booth that made it so great?
3822440	3824960	There's tournaments going on all weekend long.
3824960	3830920	Not to mention, we were the only booth that had the best giveaways.
3830920	3834720	What kind of stuff was being, oh, that's right, because they do like the $1,000 tournament
3834720	3835720	there or something, right?
3835720	3837240	Like big, big money.
3837240	3844440	Overall, it was about over $8,000 worth of prize money and prizes.
3844440	3848640	I'm kind of pissed I missed New York City by a week, I would have loved to have been
3848640	3849640	there.
3849640	3854560	Honestly, it's alright, because from what I hear they're having talks about, it's not
3854560	3860320	completely official yet, so you can't take my word on it, is next year, because there's
3860320	3864920	no more big E3, there's also going to be a Digital Life in LA.
3864920	3865920	Oh, interesting.
3865920	3867840	We might have to check that out.
3867840	3871680	Are you going to be at Nintendo World Store Saturday at noon, because I'm going to be
3871680	3872680	there?
3872680	3873680	Yeah.
3873680	3874680	Alright.
3874680	3879520	Not to put you on the spot or anything, but if you're not there, I'm going to cry.
3879520	3880520	No, I'm kidding.
3880520	3881520	I might have to see you.
3881520	3883000	No, I didn't know you were going to be there Saturday.
3883000	3884680	Oh, did you not hear the part A?
3884680	3886680	Yeah, I'm going to be there Saturday at noon.
3886680	3887680	Okay.
3887680	3888680	I'll be there.
3888680	3889680	Alright.
3889680	3890680	Well, we'll see you then.
3890680	3894680	Anything else you want to say for listeners?
3894680	3895680	No, not really.
3895680	3896680	Alright.
3896680	3897680	We'll go to some more calls.
3897680	3899520	Glad to hear you had a good time at Digital Life.
3899520	3900520	Take care.
3900520	3901520	You too.
3901520	3902520	Laid up.
3902520	3903520	Alright, bye.
3903520	3904520	Bye.
3904520	3907120	Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.
3907120	3911880	It's Orange Lounge Radio, username on Skype, or you can always give us a call on the old
3911880	3912880	regular telephone.
3912880	3913880	It's 916-226-9627.
3913880	3914880	Yes.
3914880	3916160	Let's go to another call.
3916160	3917440	Yes, you're on the air.
3917440	3918840	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3918840	3919840	Who's this?
3919840	3921160	Legend of Zaku.
3921160	3922160	Hold on, Legend of Zaku.
3922160	3923480	You need to sit tight for a minute.
3923480	3924720	Just a hint, guys.
3924720	3927600	I'm going to let you in on a little radio secret here, okay?
3927600	3931480	Sometimes we pick up the calls a little bit before I'm ready to acknowledge that you're
3931480	3935560	actually on the line just because it makes for a smoother transition that way.
3935560	3938880	So until we say, Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3938880	3939880	Shh.
3939880	3940880	Be quiet.
3940880	3941880	Be quiet.
3941880	3942880	Alright.
3942880	3943880	Zaku, what's on your mind?
3943880	3945160	Yo, I was also there too, man.
3945160	3946280	I was also at Digital Life.
3946280	3949320	I had a feeling you'd have something to say on Digital Life.
3949320	3950320	As a matter of fact, I competed.
3950320	3952480	I competed in freestyle on Saturday.
3952480	3953480	And how was it?
3953480	3960280	And what I'm about to post right now in the chat room is a link to the actual, to my routine.
3960280	3962600	Granted, it was a bad routine.
3962600	3963600	Get it?
3963600	3967800	Yes, you got the get it joke right there.
3967800	3968800	Hold on.
3968800	3969800	I did give the audience a good opportunity.
3969800	3970800	Hold on.
3970800	3971800	I'm actually looking at it right now.
3971800	3972800	Let me turn this down.
3972800	3975360	Yeah, it was a bad routine.
3975360	3978080	You're looking at the screen.
3978080	3980480	How long did you practice this?
3980480	3982580	I was totally unprepared for this.
3982580	3985400	This was an improv all the way.
3985400	3990880	I was like, yeah, you got some cool alarm movements there, but yeah, Zaku, you're looking
3990880	3992120	at the screen too much, buddy.
3992120	3993120	I'm sorry.
3993120	3994120	I know.
3994120	3995120	But it's alright though.
3995120	3999760	I wouldn't care less right now because I had a good time and I have no regrets for that.
3999760	4003040	Did you see somebody left you a comment to go dance on some landmines?
4003040	4005240	The internet's mean.
4005240	4006240	Alright.
4006240	4010880	I also played the Wii.
4010880	4014160	Yeah, what did you think of the Wii?
4014160	4015160	On Elibits, definitely.
4015160	4016720	That was hot.
4016720	4017720	You liked Elibits?
4017720	4019040	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
4019040	4023680	I mean, it was fun for the fact that you could actually aim and move stuff around.
4023680	4027360	It wasn't miscalibrated for you?
4027360	4035320	Yeah, I mean, it was a little jerky, but I had to move a little bit back because when
4035320	4038960	I moved up closer, it wasn't even engaging.
4038960	4044880	The more further away I was from the screen, the more better the controls were.
4044880	4045880	What about PS3?
4045880	4048320	Did you get your little hands on the PS3?
4048320	4050480	The lines were pretty long for that.
4050480	4052400	I managed to play Guitar Hero 2 as well.
4052400	4054040	What did you think of that?
4054040	4055960	It's kind of like the same thing.
4055960	4057840	It just has more difficulties.
4057840	4061160	You can select characters and guitars.
4061160	4064520	Here's another last minute story involving Guitar Hero 2 now that you brought it up.
4064520	4065520	Yeah, about the controller.
4065520	4066520	Hey!
4066520	4067520	Hey!
4067520	4068520	Who's hosting this show?
4068520	4069520	I'm sorry, man.
4069520	4073360	I'm sorry about spilling the beans, as you were.
4073360	4074840	You might as well finish your thought.
4074840	4080680	Zaku, why don't you play OLR Reporter here and tell us this story about Guitar Hero 2?
4080680	4090760	From what's being said, a demo version is not allowing you to play third-party controllers.
4090760	4096920	In other words, this company that essentially made its name on making third-party controllers
4096920	4103080	has locked third-party controllers out of its next game, according to the demo, if the
4103080	4107020	demo is any indication.
4107020	4109520	Right now, I've got to go, but I'll let you know.
4109520	4110880	I have some freeze swag.
4110880	4111880	What happened?
4111880	4112880	What's going on?
4112880	4113880	Why do you have to go so fast?
4113880	4116280	Now, I've got some stuff to take care of.
4116280	4117280	All right.
4117280	4121120	I'll let you know if any freeze swag has something to do with it.
4121120	4122120	All right, Zaku.
4122120	4128080	Go tell the cops who said aye.
4128080	4129080	Worst call ever.
4129080	4135720	This is the part in Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood that we learn about the word of the day.
4135720	4139160	The word of the day is fire escape.
4139160	4141720	You know what a fire escape is?
4141720	4143760	Cabbage Patch Kid.
4143760	4145960	Hi, Aaron Orange Laudreo.
4145960	4146960	Who's this?
4146960	4147960	Hi.
4147960	4148960	It's Rama.
4148960	4149960	Hi, Rama.
4149960	4150960	What's on your mind?
4150960	4151960	Hi, Rama.
4151960	4153840	Hi, Uchan.
4153840	4154840	Go figure.
4154840	4158160	All the New York City listeners are trying to hammer like mad to get through tonight.
4158160	4159160	Let me guess.
4159160	4160160	Did you go to Digital Life?
4160160	4161160	Yes, I did.
4161160	4164720	You did say last week you want all the New York callers to call in, so we did.
4164720	4165720	All right.
4165720	4166720	Well, what's on your mind?
4166720	4167720	How was Digital Life?
4167720	4168720	It was fun.
4168720	4173240	Yesterday I didn't get as much swag, but today I got there early, got plenty of good stuff,
4173240	4174240	mostly t-shirts.
4174240	4178840	Did you get to play PlayStation 3?
4178840	4181120	I didn't even bother.
4181120	4182120	Why not?
4182120	4186920	They had NBA Live up there, and it was like everybody else was around there like drooling
4186920	4187920	over NBA Live.
4187920	4189640	I'm like, it's just a game.
4189640	4194320	I played at the $600 brick last week and walked away, played the Wii.
4194320	4195720	You're cutting out a little bit there.
4195720	4199240	You said you didn't play the $600 brick, but you played the Wii?
4199240	4200240	Yes.
4200240	4201240	How was the Wii?
4201240	4204520	It was a little bit new to me.
4204520	4205520	I played Elibit.
4205520	4206520	It was fun.
4206520	4208640	Was Elibit the only game they had there or something?
4208640	4213040	No, they also had Madden for the Wii, but EA shut down now for some odd reason.
4213040	4214040	Oh, okay.
4214040	4216040	What did you think of Elibit?
4216040	4218280	It was fun.
4218280	4222200	I didn't even want to get off the machine.
4222200	4223200	Okay.
4223200	4224200	What happened with DDR?
4224200	4226480	Did you do any of the DDR stuff?
4226480	4229320	I walked over there, but it was so crowded, so I just watched.
4229320	4233600	I just hung out with Zaku and Sephiroth for a bit.
4233600	4234600	All right.
4234600	4235600	I mostly...
4235600	4238320	And you're all going to come see me in New York next week, right?
4238320	4239320	Oh, hell yeah, dude.
4239320	4240320	I'm telling you.
4240320	4242320	Get in touch with me Friday night for dinner.
4242320	4243320	All right.
4243320	4244320	Sounds good.
4244320	4248000	Well, I'll email you with the real itinerary a little later.
4248000	4249000	Of course.
4249000	4251240	That's the only thing I'm publicly saying I'm doing is the Saturday noon thing, but
4251240	4253440	I'll tell you a little more about what I'm doing later.
4253440	4254440	That's cool.
4254440	4255440	All right.
4255440	4256440	Anything else you want to share about Digital Life?
4256440	4257440	Man, it was fun.
4257440	4264000	I mean, I remember talking before about how it's going to be the next E3, but it's more
4264000	4267160	of a tech explore than anything else, so...
4267160	4271080	So you're saying because of the fact it's a little bit too broad in its tech specs that
4271080	4274040	it may not have the power to be the next E3?
4274040	4276160	I don't see it happening any time soon.
4276160	4277160	I don't.
4277160	4278160	All right.
4278160	4279160	Well, we'll see.
4279160	4280160	We'll see.
4280160	4281160	Especially if there's a Digital Life LA.
4281160	4282160	We'll see.
4282160	4283160	All right, Rama, thanks for the call.
4283160	4284160	No, Saturday.
4284160	4285160	You got it.
4285160	4286160	Friday.
4286160	4287160	Maybe Friday if you're lucky.
4287160	4288160	All right.
4288160	4289160	All right.
4289160	4290160	Later.
4290160	4291160	Hey.
4291160	4292160	That was Rama here, another New York City listener.
4292160	4293760	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4293760	4294760	Who's this?
4294760	4295760	Raven's Dolphin.
4295760	4296760	Hello, buddy.
4296760	4298480	What's on your mind?
4298480	4301160	You made me force me to get a Wii order.
4301160	4302160	Hold on.
4302160	4303160	Hold on.
4303160	4304160	Sit tight for a minute there.
4304160	4305160	Hold on.
4305160	4308200	Extrovert snuck in here while we've been taking these calls.
4308200	4311280	Did you notice, Extrovert, that all the same people that call into the Wednesday show call
4311280	4312280	into this show?
4312280	4313640	Isn't that funny?
4313640	4315040	That is mucho hilarious.
4315040	4316480	Yeah, it's great.
4316480	4317480	It's the same people.
4317480	4318480	Listen to both shows.
4318480	4319480	It's amazing.
4319480	4320480	I'm sorry, Raven's Dolphin.
4320480	4321480	What were you saying?
4321480	4322520	You were saying something about the Wii pre-ordering?
4322520	4325600	You forced me to get a Wii order for the day of Orange Launch Radio.
4325600	4326600	What did I do?
4326600	4327600	Get a gun to your head?
4327600	4328600	No.
4328600	4330600	You've been talking about, you've got to get a Wii.
4330600	4331600	You've got to get a Wii.
4331600	4332600	You've got to get a Wii.
4332600	4333600	What did I say?
4333600	4334600	You've got to get a Wii.
4334600	4335600	You've got to get a Wii.
4335600	4336760	But that's what's going through my mind.
4336760	4337760	You're like, Wii.
4337760	4338760	Like, 200?
4338760	4344240	No, because I want a Wii really badly.
4344240	4347480	As I said earlier, I referenced what I told that email bag thing earlier.
4347480	4349880	You really have to make decisions based on what's best for you.
4349880	4353960	And what's best for me right now, Wii.
4353960	4356360	I figured your logic too.
4356360	4360360	I'm going Wii 60 all the way.
4360360	4361360	How was your experience pre-ordering?
4361360	4362520	Where did you go?
4362520	4363520	How was it?
4363520	4366000	Actually, it wasn't that bad.
4366000	4368600	The mall I didn't go to was jammed.
4368600	4371440	I mean, God, I'm glad I didn't go there.
4371440	4373760	But the one in Atlantic City was nice.
4373760	4376560	I stood in line for an hour and 40 minutes.
4376560	4380240	It was like this woman, her car broke down.
4380240	4382320	I'm sorry to hear that.
4382320	4384200	But her kid wanted the Wii so bad.
4384200	4385400	It was eight people.
4385400	4387400	And they were all nice.
4387400	4390920	Wait, it was eight people that all came together?
4390920	4392880	Or it was eight people on the line?
4392880	4393880	Eight people in line.
4393880	4394880	Oh, that doesn't seem...
4394880	4396560	Whereabouts are you from?
4396560	4397900	Atlantic City.
4397900	4401440	That doesn't seem very long, all things considered, for a town like Atlantic City.
4401440	4402920	Only eight people on the line.
4402920	4403920	Huh.
4403920	4404920	Well, okay.
4404920	4406640	We're a small town.
4406640	4407960	The only thing we do is gamble.
4407960	4408960	I guess that's true.
4408960	4409960	That's true.
4409960	4413280	Yeah, but I bet the Vegas GameStop lines were long.
4413280	4414280	I bet.
4414280	4420280	Well, you know, one of the best places to go for cheap electronics is pawn shops in
4420280	4422300	gambling towns.
4422300	4424040	So go to your local pawn shop.
4424040	4425040	Find a Wii.
4425040	4427040	That's a good suggestion.
4427040	4429320	Well, what did you pre-order with your Wii?
4429320	4431960	Did you just get the Wii or did you get any games?
4431960	4437560	I just got the Wii because I know I have to have it Orange Lounge radio episode I can't
4437560	4439160	remember for the 19th.
4439160	4440160	All right.
4440160	4443200	Yeah, I don't know what number it is either, but it's going to be an interesting show.
4443200	4445680	Our buddy DMN is actually going to be here in-house.
4445680	4448680	So we're going to have our Nintendo QA guy actually here in-house.
4448680	4450000	So it'll be fun.
4450000	4451080	Yeah, one more.
4451080	4457480	I actually went to a McDonald's for a Wayport and it works pretty good.
4457480	4458480	All right.
4458480	4459480	That's cool.
4459480	4460920	And you got a vision camera.
4460920	4463320	Now we can have a Rob Astley.
4463320	4464520	No.
4464520	4466240	Not happening.
4466240	4467880	Not without proper compensation.
4467880	4468880	Bye.
4468880	4469880	All right, freak.
4469880	4470880	I'm hanging up on you now.
4470880	4471880	Bye.
4471880	4472880	Bye.
4472880	4473880	What is up with that?
4473880	4474880	What's with the...
4474880	4477640	It's so weird.
4477640	4478640	Who would want to see that?
4478640	4481280	Who would want to see my ass on Xbox Live?
4481280	4482280	That's disgusting.
4482280	4483280	Oh, Rob.
4483280	4484400	You know everyone wants to see your ass.
4484400	4485840	Not until I work it out a little bit.
4485840	4486840	Sorry.
4486840	4487840	I think they want to see your Wii.
4487840	4489620	Well, they ain't going to get that.
4489620	4490620	One more call.
4490620	4491840	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge radio.
4491840	4492840	Who's this?
4492840	4493840	It's Darkteeth.
4493840	4496600	Hey, what's on your mind, Darkteeth?
4496600	4497600	Darkteeth?
4497600	4498600	No, Darktetsuya.
4498600	4499600	It's...
4499600	4500600	Darkteeth.
4500600	4501600	It's short for Darktetsuya.
4501600	4502600	I'm sorry.
4502600	4503600	Shut up and let the man talk.
4503600	4504600	We have iced tea.
4504600	4505600	We have darkteeth.
4505600	4506600	He's one of our hardworking staffers.
4506600	4507600	What's on your mind?
4507600	4511240	I had a few FUs.
4511240	4512240	You have FUs?
4512240	4513240	Well...
4513240	4514240	Are they gaming-related?
4514240	4515240	Yeah.
4515240	4518880	Okay, then we'll take them.
4518880	4519880	What's up?
4519880	4527920	Well, you heard about Konami's little Link issue thing on Supernova?
4527920	4532960	Yeah, I guess they officially declared that Link Mode ain't happening this week, or, I
4532960	4536520	mean, this week the official press announcement went out, or whatever you want to call it.
4536520	4540720	At least DDR Freak ran it, that said Link Mode's not happening in Supernova.
4540720	4541720	That makes you mad?
4541720	4542720	Yeah.
4542720	4543720	Oh, a little bit.
4543720	4547360	Were you looking forward to making custom dance steps to songs such as, you know, what...
4547360	4550040	I don't even know what the hell songs are in Supernova.
4550040	4552960	Well, I had it planned.
4552960	4553960	I see.
4553960	4554960	Okay.
4554960	4555960	Any other FUs?
4555960	4556960	Gaming-related?
4556960	4564840	Well, just that my local arcade hasn't gotten Supernova yet.
4564840	4568480	What is up with lack of Supernova machines in Sacramento?
4568480	4569480	I know.
4569480	4571400	I guess we're just not a real town.
4571400	4573640	We're just some cow town in the middle of nowhere.
4573640	4575560	Well, someday, Dark Tetsuya, someday.
4575560	4576560	Yeah.
4576560	4579640	Hey, did you do any of the Wii pre-ordering or PlayStation 3?
4579640	4580640	Oh, no.
4580640	4581640	I'm not kidding.
4581640	4582640	Are you going to be getting any of them?
4582640	4585440	I'll probably get a Wii for Christmas.
4585440	4586440	Okay.
4586440	4588960	Oh, you're hoping Santa will bring you one?
4588960	4590280	Yeah.
4590280	4591480	Have you been good this year?
4591480	4592480	Oh, yeah.
4592480	4595760	Well, then maybe Santa will bring you one, so that'll be cool.
4595760	4596760	All right.
4596760	4599440	Or he'll give you a spanking or some coal.
4599440	4600440	Yeah.
4600440	4603840	If you've been bad, though, you'll get a six axis, and that's all you get.
4603840	4607080	You just get the paperweight of a six axis.
4607080	4608680	You guys aren't on the Afterbirth, right?
4608680	4609680	No.
4609680	4610680	We're on the actual podcast show.
4610680	4611680	Oh, wow.
4611680	4612680	I've never been on the podcast before.
4612680	4613680	I guess this is my first time.
4613680	4614680	Oh, sorry.
4614680	4617140	Extrofer's one of our other personalities on Orange Lawns Radio.
4617140	4619560	He does the Wednesday night show with me, and what else would they know you from?
4619560	4621720	He had a train wreck show that was on the station a while ago.
4621720	4622720	Yeah.
4622720	4623720	It was called Train Wreck the Show.
4623720	4625000	You play a lot of World of Warcraft.
4625000	4626720	You've been on this show before, haven't you?
4626720	4629080	I've been on Orange Lawns Radio, but I haven't been on the podcast.
4629080	4630080	That is the podcast.
4630080	4632080	Orange Lawns Radio is the podcast.
4632080	4633080	No, no.
4633080	4634080	I was on it before you guys.
4634080	4635080	Oh, okay.
4635080	4636080	You did the live show and then the podcast.
4636080	4637080	Fine.
4637080	4638080	Well, now you're here.
4638080	4639080	I don't fucking care.
4639080	4640080	Welcome to the goddamn show.
4640080	4641080	Thank you.
4641080	4642080	Now be quiet.
4642080	4643080	All right.
4643080	4644080	Anything else on your mind, Dark Dead Sea?
4644080	4645080	Blood in your vagina.
4645080	4648680	Well, other than that, I really like Supernova.
4648680	4649680	Yeah?
4649680	4651960	Do you like the home release of Supernova?
4651960	4652960	Yep.
4652960	4653960	Top three songs.
4653960	4654960	Quick.
4654960	4655960	Oh, God.
4655960	4662440	That'll settle with that honor, humanity, and Gummel and the couple.
4662440	4663440	Of course.
4663440	4664920	Of course you'd say that.
4664920	4666480	Guacamole del Taco, right?
4666480	4667480	Oh, yeah.
4667480	4668480	All right.
4668480	4669480	All right, Dark Tetsuya.
4669480	4670480	Thanks so much for the call.
4670480	4671480	Have a good one.
4671480	4672480	All right?
4672480	4673480	You too.
4673480	4674480	Later.
4674480	4675780	One of our hardworking staff members there, that Dark Tetsuya.
4675780	4677280	We appreciate him.
4677280	4681160	All right, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight, if you didn't get through.
4681160	4682320	So sorry.
4682320	4683320	Try again next week.
4683320	4685320	Any other last minute stories?
4685320	4686760	Loki.
4686760	4687760	Of course.
4687760	4692320	We talked about it earlier about video game movies and there being a movie called 8-Bit
4692320	4693560	the Movie.
4693560	4696920	Well, actually, there is another movie coming out.
4696920	4699680	For your PSP, you can download the entire movie.
4699680	4707100	It's called Killing Time 24x7, and it is available online, actually, for full download
4707100	4709000	to your PSP, which I think is kind of cool.
4709000	4713120	It's kind of like a Hitman movie, basically.
4713120	4718400	The main character who kills people and in his spare time hangs out with his friends
4718400	4724040	and goes to arcades and whatnot and stuff, gets a new assignment, and his new hit is
4724040	4728360	his father, and so it's kind of based on that.
4728360	4729360	It's actually pretty cool.
4729360	4736360	The download itself is about 300, just over 300 megs, and you can actually find it to
4736360	4742200	download and I'm pulling up the website actually right now.
4742200	4743200	Thrilling radio.
4743200	4744200	Sorry.
4744200	4758800	Yeah, but anyways, I believe it's killingtime-24-7.com if you want to download it, download it for
4758800	4759800	your PSP.
4759800	4760800	All right.
4760800	4761800	That's it?
4761800	4763800	That's all I have.
4763800	4764800	Wow.
4764800	4765800	For now.
4765800	4766800	That's all I have.
4766800	4767800	Usually you have a whole shitload of last minute news.
4767800	4771960	Well, you know, I mean, we can talk about some other stuff, I guess, since we were talking
4771960	4772960	about...
4772960	4773960	How about one sentence?
4773960	4774960	One sentence news.
4774960	4775960	One sentence news.
4775960	4776960	Okay.
4776960	4777960	Yes.
4777960	4778960	Coming soon.
4778960	4779960	Sky's voice the game.
4779960	4780960	No.
4780960	4785320	The, was it the, one of the professional gaming leagues in Pizza Hut teamed up and no one
4785320	4786320	cared.
4786320	4787320	That was good.
4787320	4789040	That was one sentence.
4789040	4792800	Tony Hawk's Project 8 gets some pretty awesome multiplayer on the 360.
4792800	4795360	PlayStation 3 does not have any multiplayer whatsoever.
4795360	4797240	I think that was two sentences, but that's all right.
4797240	4798240	It was good.
4798240	4799240	Send me a colon.
4799240	4800240	Was there?
4800240	4801240	Okay.
4801240	4805640	Um, Microsoft launched a new website to browse Xbox Live Marketplace.
4805640	4808720	Ah, I actually saw that.
4808720	4809720	And that was pretty cool.
4809720	4811920	Ah, that, see, you made it two sentences.
4811920	4814560	I was, I was done with the story.
4814560	4815560	Oh, sorry.
4815560	4816560	Anyways.
4816560	4818080	And the website is Xbox Pipeline or whatever that's called.
4818080	4819760	Xbox Live Pipeline, something like that.
4819760	4820760	Something like that.
4820760	4821760	Anyways.
4821760	4822760	We're so informative.
4822760	4823760	Yeah, there's some website.
4823760	4826360	I couldn't tell you what the name of it is.
4826360	4827360	Whoa, okay.
4827360	4828360	Here.
4828360	4829360	Okay.
4829360	4830480	I will tell you the exact website because I am awesome like that.
4830480	4836720	Anyways, the actual website is XboxLivePipeline.com, so go check it out if you haven't already.
4836720	4838280	It has the look and feel of an Xbox.
4838280	4839280	It's kind of nice.
4839280	4840280	It's pretty cool.
4840280	4842760	I have some news.
4842760	4844480	Okay.
4844480	4847400	Loki is officially very funny.
4847400	4851320	Last night we went and ate out at a, um, buffet place.
4851320	4852320	Okay.
4852320	4854440	I'm sorry, this doesn't have to do with the games.
4854440	4857800	We killed people on the way because we were racing there.
4857800	4860400	Is that good enough?
4860400	4866560	Anyways, Loki asks the waiter, the waitress or whoever she was serving us or whatever.
4866560	4873840	She said he, he asked her if we, they're serving any popcorn shrimp and she goes, and he looks
4873840	4874840	at her.
4874840	4875840	He goes, okay.
4875840	4879920	And everybody's like, did you understand what she just said?
4879920	4882360	Loki's, Loki's just very calm.
4882360	4884360	I didn't understand anything.
4884360	4887080	Anyways, it's just so funny.
4887080	4890320	Give it up for extra furnace, farewell performance here on Orange Labs Radio.
4890320	4891320	All right.
4891320	4896400	Um, one thing I did want to mention, I read this week on the PlayStation 3 online web
4896400	4901160	browser they were talking about, um, that it has is for text entry.
4901160	4905400	If you don't have, you know, a controller or whatever, it has that crappy text entry
4905400	4908040	that they have on the PSP.
4908040	4909040	Isn't that stupid?
4909040	4911320	I just wanted to mention that.
4911320	4917840	Um, some other fun stuff I was going to say, um, I remember, well, Japan's getting a brand
4917840	4923360	new Wii classic controller plus five or 5,000 point bundle, which is nice because we'll
4923360	4926080	never see that here.
4926080	4929320	And I think that was all I had.
4929320	4934080	Oh, oh, PlayStation 3 Oblivion's getting, was supposed to be getting exclusive content
4934080	4937280	for it, but it actually is going to be available for us as well.
4937280	4940560	So on the Xbox 360 and PC.
4940560	4942120	Oh well.
4942120	4945840	Oh, a new Prey content for online multiplayer maps and stuff.
4945840	4947400	I really haven't played much Prey.
4947400	4948400	We should.
4948400	4951200	It's some easy ass achievement points and achievement points more like you ought to
4951200	4952200	be efficient.
4952200	4953200	I know.
4953200	4954200	I'm meaning to get some.
4954200	4956440	If you and I would play some death match, we could get those 25 kill achievements like
4956440	4957440	that.
4957440	4958440	It'd be easy.
4958440	4961240	Just, yeah, too bad they don't have split screen multiplayer because that's how I did
4961240	4964280	it with, uh, Ghost Recon.
4964280	4965280	Cheater.
4965280	4966280	Cheater.
4966280	4967280	All right.
4967280	4969520	Um, I don't have any more last minute news.
4969520	4970520	Dark Sakura?
4970520	4977320	Um, actually I did want to make a mention, uh, for our European listeners, um, that people
4977320	4984960	who are fans of Eurogamer, they've, uh, brought out a new download service, uh, for a $12.95
4984960	4991320	a month for the Ultimate Collection so you can get, uh, uh, different games.
4991320	4996400	Um, they actually have, uh, for $6.95, access to the Essential Collection with 90 games
4996400	5000680	to choose from including Prince of Persia, Hitman, Contract, Splinter Cell, Pandora,
5000680	5001680	Tomorrow.
5001680	5007160	Um, lots of different stuff coming up on there, um, but I would recommend going onto their
5007160	5009040	main page and taking a look at it.
5009040	5015800	If you want to play, uh, Java or NES games on your PC at work instead of working, you
5015800	5024520	can go to vnes.thatsanderskid.com and they have a whole Java thing for playing Nintendo
5024520	5025520	games.
5025520	5026520	All right, this is too much news for one night.
5026520	5027520	It's time to wrap up the program.
5027520	5028520	I'm done.
5028520	5030320	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5030320	5033840	Extrofer, your final thought, dare I ask?
5033840	5036520	Loki, will you marry me?
5036520	5038160	Loki, your final thought.
5038160	5039160	No.
5039160	5042160	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
5042160	5049800	Oh, yes, I forgot the Grudge 2 opened up this weekend.
5049800	5051400	Who wants to go see it with me?
5051400	5054720	Not me, that's my final thought.
5054720	5059560	Extrofer will go see it with me, won't you?
5059560	5060560	No.
5060560	5061560	I'm kidding.
5061560	5062560	I'm kidding.
5062560	5063560	I'm kidding.
5063560	5064560	Oh, damn, I wish it were a TV.
5064560	5065560	No, I totally won't.
5065560	5066560	You should see the way he did that.
5066560	5067560	He kind of did this whole little...
5067560	5068560	I will.
5068560	5069560	Well, no.
5069560	5070560	No, I...
5070560	5071800	It's not you, Dark Sakura.
5071800	5072800	It's the movie.
5072800	5073800	I...
5073800	5074800	You know what?
5074800	5075800	No, I will see it.
5075800	5076800	I just want to see Sarah Michelle Gellar die.
5076800	5077800	I do, too.
5077800	5078800	Oh, my God.
5078800	5079800	Spoilers.
5079800	5080800	No, she doesn't die soon.
5080800	5086760	I saw a really good movie this last weekend, though, called The Departed.
5086760	5087760	It was so great.
5087760	5088760	Great, great, great.
5088760	5089760	Guess what?
5089760	5090760	Guess what?
5090760	5091760	What?
5091760	5092760	Rob.
5092760	5093760	What?
5093760	5094760	Rob.
5094760	5095760	What?
5095760	5096760	What?
5096760	5097760	What?
5097760	5098760	What?
5098760	5099760	What?
5099760	5100760	What?
5100760	5101760	What?
5101760	5102760	What's going on right there?
5102760	5106280	Two quick, quick quick things that came out.
5106280	5112000	One thing that's being reported in our chat literally right this second, Bubble Bubble
5112000	5114020	for the DS is broken.
5114020	5116360	Players cannot be past level 30.
5116360	5118500	This has been confirmed by Codemasters.
5118500	5119960	Way to go, Codemasters QA.
5119960	5121080	Loki, your thing, real quick?
5121080	5123820	Oh, I was just making fun of this thing.
5123820	5129420	They ran a report on Gizmodo about stuff that you can buy that looks stupid.
5129420	5134700	that you can buy that looks stupid. There's a Mame cabinet costume for Halloween. I just
5134700	5139640	thought it was funny because the joystick, which is abnormally large, is placed right
5139640	5144720	next to where his penis would be, and the coin door, which has two slots right where
5144720	5149460	his balls would be. That's just the college humor in me.
5149460	5154440	That's lovely. And on that note, we're going to call it a night for Orange Lounge Radio
5154440	5159380	this week. Remember, we will not be live on Sunday next week. We're pre-taped because
5159380	5162420	both DarkSakura and I are traveling. Shh. God dammit.
5162420	5166700	Remember, YowieCon. Or New York City, Nintendo World Store.
5166700	5170700	Or Nightmare Before Christmas at the Metreon on Friday night.
5170700	5173900	And that- Exeter! Hey, I do a lot better than you do.
5173900	5178900	I know. Can I just unplug that microphone? Yeah, there we go. See, now it's unplugged.
5178900	5184580	Thank you for supporting independent internet radio even when it's crappy like tonight.
5184580	5185580	Good night.
5185580	5190580	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
