15436	19118	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19598	25260	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 204 for this, October the 15th of 2006.
25840	35524	And if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget that Orange Lounge Radio is podcast twice a week, so you're actually listening to the second half of a show already in progress.
35844	40926	If you want to catch the whole thing live when it broadcasts, you should listen to Orange Lounge Radio live on Sunday nights.
41406	48832	or there's always our rebroadcast that plays on All Games Radio, Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
49372	63703	Speaking of All Games Radio, our buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show over there Sunday nights as well, just before we do, he's going to be doing some type of trivia contest at the big video games expo, which I wish I was going, but sadly I'm not.
64635	71109	The VG Expo, if you're within traveling distance, unfortunately, when I talk about going, now we're talking about a plane ticket.
71149	74357	But for those of you on the East Coast, it's probably very drivable from lots of different spots.
74718	74918	VGExpo.com
105236	111599	Well, such is life that we would have more news about Halo 3 at some point and at some point it's going to be Halloween.
112019	122963	Yes, the spooky holiday will feature some brand new news about Halo 3 and yeah, that's about all we know is that there's going to be news.
123784	125464	It's news about upcoming news.
127105	129906	Halo 3 is coming soon.
130826	131967	That's going to be the big news.
133393	143402	Do you think as we theorized previously, because you had that whole report talking about Halo 3 is likely to be coming out in April or May, do you think this could be where they drop that bombshell?
143442	145063	Could this be the big bombshell that's coming out?
145604	149227	It would be aptly timed, but probably not.
149487	151769	You think it's more something along the notion of gameplay?
152830	157194	You know this is time, though, to take a little bit of Sony's thunder from PlayStation 3.
158652	164714	to get people talking about Halo 3 amongst the PlayStation 3 and Wii chaos that's sure to be going on in November.
164874	183199	Well, I guess currently right now they're showing Halo 3 to a select group of magazine journalists, not websites, but a handful of magazine folks, and yeah, it looks like they're going to be having some sort of event, and they're inviting game journalists from the U.S.
183259	188020	and Europe to visit their studio and show a quick single-player
188897	189317	Demo.
190618	201364	Alright, well, you know, I would say go out and buy the magazine to see the news, but it's going to be all over the internet the day it comes out anyway, probably before it lands in your mailbox, so just read the internet.
204085	212089	Speaking of things that are at least being said around the internet and other places, Sony's talking some crap.
213010	217032	Actually, to be specific, that would be Nobuyuki Ide, who is the
218129	222512	former, um, uh, wasn't he the former CEO of Sony?
225014	227837	He's actually their current chief corporate advisor.
228317	235703	So when he was asked about the Xbox 360 being the PS3 to market, he said Microsoft is not a technology company.
236583	238305	No, they make lunchboxes.
243849	245130	Well, and Nintendo makes cards.
246147	251328	at least they used to back in the day but you know yeah they made Hanafuda cards doesn't he used to run brothels too?
252228	275574	I really don't know but this I just think that's funny because this guy was responsible for a lot of damage to Sony's profits back in the day but you know I think that it would be in Sony's best interest right now not to be throwing mud you know that's what I would be doing you know
275885	280047	Concentrate on getting your console out instead of saying, our console's better than your console.
280647	283628	I mean, except our console's not out yet and yours is.
283868	287970	Well, Sony pisses me off even more because they're discontinuing the AIBO.
289350	290151	I love the AIBO.
290291	291571	Yeah, but the AIBO is useless.
291891	293312	The AIBO is their little robot dog.
293752	294252	Oh.
294332	298134	I think that if they're going to do anything, they should make the AIBO a peripheral for the PS3.
298174	300515	That would sell more units.
300535	302055	That might actually happen.
302075	303136	That might sell me one.
304304	304684	I'd buy one.
304704	307786	That's just what I need, my PlayStation 3 to bark at me and play Blu-rays.
308667	309787	Brilliant idea, Jamie.
309867	315691	After all, I mean, after looking at what was the Eye of Judgment set up that they have at G... I don't think that's true.
315751	317792	I thought it would lower your blood pressure.
318012	320513	I'd rather have a barking PlayStation 3 in that Eye of Judgment.
320974	321394	No, no, no.
321474	322174	It wouldn't bark.
322234	329539	It would hook up to the PS3 and you would play, like, instead of having Nintendogs, you'd have a real dog sim because you'd have your robot dog.
329599	330739	So it's like Rob the Robot.
332140	333381	But only, like...
334395	335575	Only good for more than one game.
335595	339236	You know, I always wish they would... This is why you're on internet radio, Jamie, and not in a boardroom.
339796	341237	You know what?
341277	342517	My ideas would sell money.
342577	343377	People should hire me.
343938	355000	They need to create Rob the Robot, like, as in... I always wanted, like, a miniature version of it for, like, the DS or something like that, that would sit next to your DS and do the same little thing and just re-release Gyromite or something like that.
355201	355821	I think that'd be fun.
356041	359982	Well, actually, one of the good things, though, about the AIBO is it actually was a very inexpensive...
361260	369422	Pretty, you know, interestingly complex AI, you know, in the little system that you could afford better than, like, a human-sized robot.
369462	375103	And a lot of AI developers and robotics experts were actually buying AIBOs for experiments.
375443	379804	Drunami in our chatroom is suggesting that here on Orange Sounds Radio we could replace Loki with an AIBO.
380684	381544	That would be cute.
381564	382345	That would be pretty fun.
382365	383545	I bet the AIBO is a lot cuter.
384665	385925	AIBOs are really cute.
386205	387586	It'd go well with my new Mac.
388626	389206	When I get it.
392003	413834	Speaking of Sony, before Loki has a chance to give a counter-argument there, speaking about Sony executives who are sitting in boardrooms eating crayons all day when they ought to be working, this executive, Michael Ephraim from Sony of Australia, you know, he made this crazy comment earlier in the week that was essentially insinuating that the Wii and the 360 were too pricey.
416155	419277	The maker of the most expensive console...
420020	422882	for the next gen says the Wii and the 360 are too pricey.
423022	423562	Okay, whatever.
423843	426985	Well, he further clarified his statements later in the week, but this is what he said.
427345	436571	Quote, sorry you didn't have the opportunity to buy a PlayStation 3 this year, but I'm sure it beats lining up in a queue for hours on end only to be told the store has sold out.
437132	437432	Okay.
437492	441335	No doubt in response to the delays over in Europe and some of the other countries.
441575	444857	So, yeah, too bad you didn't have that opportunity to do that now.
445037	445678	Don't worry.
445878	447499	Your opportunity is coming soon.
449977	455942	This just goes, look, again, I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is going to be a just fine system.
456002	458744	Give it a little, it's like a fine wine, it'll age just fine.
459144	462467	But Sony executives, seriously, gag order.
462907	467231	Seriously, Sony, if you're listening, you need all these people to STFU.
467591	479180	You need to get a public figure that, you know, is not going to be a laughing stock of the internet, such as Reggie Miyamoto over there, or Major Nelson, Peter Moore over here.
479938	481559	Sony needs somebody like that.
483200	493707	And I'll tell you what, it's not this guy, it's not the giant enemy crab guy, who, as I hear, has suffered so much embarrassment from that, he doesn't do public appearances anymore.
493767	495568	I feel bad for him, almost, in a way.
495848	497109	His bosses probably made him do that.
497609	498030	And Kaz.
498670	503113	Oh, I'm sure they, like, leave giant enemy crabs at his desk and stuff like that.
503173	504854	You know that game's just never going to come out now.
505374	508736	or if it does come out, that'll be on the big sticker.
509096	520442	It should be one of those things like the movie Showgirls where at this point it should just be self-aware of the joke that it is now and just market itself as, hey, we're that historically accurate game with the crabs.
522403	524524	Maybe they could just say the game caught crabs.
524704	526465	He goes to his doctor for a physical.
526905	527926	I've got bad news for you.
528086	529506	You have giant enemy crabs.
530207	530867	Poor guy.
532308	532628	Anyways.
533106	533966	Now when I play a PS3 title...
560974	573884	I simply can't depend on having a single friends list so I'm going to go manage the master list which should have presence in every PS3 title and X-Fire will be a plugin that some publishers integrate into some games and some won't.
574004	576907	That means gamers can't depend on finding their friends in one place.
578108	588816	And he goes on talking about more other stuff and talking about how X-Fire is going to cost money because they're licensing it and stuff and what's that going to do with the whole service and the fact that we haven't really heard much about
589127	590448	and their online service.
591629	593670	Yeah, so who knows?
594510	597312	So some fair equal time type stories here.
597412	599634	Microsoft's doing some of the smack talking too.
600274	612342	Maybe should be leaving the PR to folks like Major Nelson and maybe some of the underground communities, the huge Xbox fan communities out there, some of our other friendly podcasts such as Gamer Tag and XBL.
613382	615524	But there is some other interesting stuff though.
617093	627217	This is funny because as soon as they ran this, that of course someone had to come to Sony's defense and that they did.
627757	643482	And actually, they were talking about some of the information and they also posted in their blog saying there's some bad information there responding to the blog post that I'll get to in a sec.
643662	645443	But it was interesting to me in...
646255	648136	X-Fire Friends List Online President Smed
676391	677212	Welcome to Sony.
677292	677993	Eat this crayon.
678693	679033	All right.
679634	685218	Look, let's go from all these smack-talking executives to you guys smack-talking us in our mailbag.
685678	686259	No, just kidding.
686299	688080	We haven't gotten a lot of hate mail recently, have we?
688340	688721	Not really.
688761	689321	Well, that's good.
689461	689802	That's good.
689822	691303	I'm glad you guys have been nice and polite.
691323	692123	We appreciate that.
693004	693925	You can send us an email.
693965	696246	It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
696287	698188	And every week, Dark Sakura suits up.
698772	699712	DarkSakura.com Send us more.
730470	754726	Well, the first email actually comes from Orko4, basically saying that in Hickory, North Carolina, there was a restaurant called Tallywhackers, me bringing up how they should make peckers as a thing to Hooters, and that the owner wanted the waiters to be shirtless and wearing Speedos, but they couldn't for health violations, so they wore really tight-ass shorts and tank tops.
754826	757708	Oh yeah, I remember you talking about the male Hooters a couple weeks ago.
757728	758068	I wonder why.
760780	764363	and the last line says, keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear the Doctor Who website of the week.
764643	768606	Well, it's not Doctor Who this week, so it's Torchwood.
769807	770447	That's a spin-off.
770888	771568	I see.
772249	774430	Next comes from Mike.
776412	776712	Hey!
777633	780355	The other day I saw a Nintendo presentation on game trailers.
780375	781395	Is that how it really started off?
781435	781736	Hey!
783237	785879	Suddenly it's that little fairy that follows you in The Legend of Zelda.
785919	786019	Hey!
786039	786459	Listen!
786499	786659	Hey!
786699	787600	Listen!
788280	788641	Listen!
790297	792578	That's how I want you all to open up your emails from now on.
792858	793898	Hey, listen!
795819	797099	Anyway, to continue.
797879	805661	It's said that the price points for the virtual console, 500, 700, and 1,000 points are actually worded as starting at points.
806261	809862	So, does this mean that we could be paying $15 for a Nintendo 64 game?
809882	810883	Just wanted to hear your thoughts.
811863	812323	Possibly.
813864	814284	We'll see.
814304	815344	I wouldn't be behind him.
817056	818457	You know what I was just thinking about, though?
818918	823842	If Ocarina of Time does come to Virtual Console, why would I get that?
823902	827285	Because I have the little GameCube disc that had it on there.
827865	830107	It has a limited release, so whatever.
831008	832969	I thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $10.
833690	836933	I thought it was $5 for NES, $8 for Super Nintendo, $10 for Nintendo 64.
836973	837974	Another email from Michael.
846192	849714	This is HeySky, Loki, and DarkSakura, and maybe Drew Nami, who is not here tonight.
850454	851194	He's in our chat room.
852135	852475	Stop that.
853595	853956	Stop what?
857777	861059	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
861079	862059	Rob, only you can see this.
862640	864380	Oh, Loki can see it too, but it's aimed toward you.
864841	865121	I see.
865221	865521	Thank you.
865661	866281	Is that your IQ?
866681	866781	One?
867542	867702	No.
868362	868602	Mail?
869002	869223	Email?
872024	873985	First off, I'd like to say that I love your show.
874205	874485	Thank you.
875014	880696	and I've been listening on the podcast stream for a year and a few months and I most recently listened live last week.
881217	890180	Speaking of which, I was the one who called in and hung up Tasete Purim, I guess I said that.
890700	891421	I think it's Latin.
891641	892501	I didn't take Latin, sorry.
892561	895302	I think he's actually renamed himself in chat to just call me Mike.
895762	896843	So we'll call him Mike.
897143	897503	Hi, Mike.
898324	898924	Sorry about that.
898984	901605	I forgot to mute the live stream while using Skype.
901665	901865	Oops.
901885	901965	Oops.
902563	905865	Anyway, earlier on Xbox, what's up with me?
905885	908787	On episode 203, sports games came up.
908847	911069	Most of the hosts on OLR aren't sports games fans.
911549	913951	You said that sports games are just a roster update.
914291	916072	Well, the same can be said about music games.
916373	922977	Sure, games like DDR have a few very marginal new innovations, but for the most part, the games are just the same damn thing with new music.
923398	931043	And to some idiotic gamers, they just hear weird Japanese techno and they think it's the same damn thing with the same music and a new number after the title.
931513	934915	While I disagree with both arguments, I think that both make a valid point.
935355	937657	So here's my call to the game developers and producers.
937717	939458	Don't make a new game until it's ready.
940318	945922	Sure, your game can have all the songs of players in the world, but don't put it out until it is better than its predecessor.
947443	950845	That's exactly what they're doing at 3D Realms.
952366	952626	What?
955308	956008	Duke Nukem Forever.
956168	958329	They're making sure that it's ready.
959090	959830	Is the email done?
960071	960351	No.
960431	960671	Okay.
962304	966327	This goes for all games, not just music or sports games.
966367	967988	Take the Halo franchise, for example.
968388	969649	Halo 1, a masterpiece.
969689	971330	Halo 2, an Unreal Tournament skin.
971670	974052	Don't get me wrong, I play Halo 2 almost exclusively.
974092	977253	Halo 2 has pushed out the door too quickly, and just for live experience.
977434	981716	Halo 2 was an unsatisfying game that could have been even better than the original.
982116	985098	Then the master of re-releasing a game, whether it needs to be or not.
985458	985959	Metal Slug.
986759	987500	I love Metal Slug.
987600	988000	It rocks.
988536	1016151	but when it's been pushed toward me on every available medium with no new features it makes me never want to buy a Metal Slug game again even if it has every feature in the world I love Metal Slug anyway game developers need to realize something sure you release the sequel to a good game it sells well but what if you want to make it a trilogy is it accepted or is it looked on as milking the franchise it makes sense in the short term but in one of the worst options in the long run
1017060	1024162	Soon gamers will get smart and realize they are being scammed by buying the same game every year.
1025083	1027203	I've been trying to tell this to anyone who will listen.
1027243	1028284	Sadly, I think it's too late.
1029124	1029384	P.S.
1029404	1030784	Sorry if I'm sending you this email again.
1030804	1031365	It said the first one.
1031485	1033045	Oh, yeah, I didn't get the first one.
1033065	1033285	Sorry.
1035526	1040027	Okay, I thought it was a pretty clever comparison, the whole roster update versus the music games.
1040528	1041748	But I think...
1042674	1044756	For that, it really depends on what you're into.
1044816	1047959	I mean, I don't hate sports games.
1048079	1049961	I just recognize that that's not what I'm into.
1051102	1056627	And I'm sure for most of them, maybe dance games isn't really what they're into.
1056987	1064294	And so they wouldn't recognize the fact that the new dance games do go through interface upgrades and usually there's a new mode in them somewhere.
1064714	1068037	And certainly the entire list of songs gets refreshed with
1068433	1069353	and so on and so on.
1069373	1071054	I'm not going to bore you to death with the comparisons.
1071074	1075235	It's an interesting analogy, but I think us being fans of dance games, we don't see that.
1075255	1077536	You or other sports games fans, you don't see the comparison.
1091033	1093615	That either, that the rest of us just see the roster update or whatever.
1093955	1095816	Well, actually, I think it's exactly the same thing.
1095836	1100538	In fact, that neither of the games have, you know, very, you know, huge improvements.
1100839	1104601	Granted, sports games go through, you know, graphical improvements and stuff and roster updates.
1105061	1113726	But, you know, this is even coming from people, you know, reviewing, you know, the brand new EA lineup or whatever that they aren't really adding anything new and it really just is a roster update.
1114146	1119049	But, you know, that's something that they need to prove in both, you know, dance games and, you know,
1119850	1122052	Sports Games, and probably a lot of other games.
1122112	1124173	I mean, like, what, God of War 2?
1124593	1128356	I mean, that looks basically like kind of an update, you know, to God of War 1.
1128937	1132559	You know, look at... Oh, a lot of games are like that nowadays, you know.
1133380	1135381	Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room has an interesting point.
1135802	1138504	Roster updates don't really change the gameplay all too much.
1138924	1141406	New music and music games do change gameplay a bit.
1141706	1144988	You have to learn new steps and that sort to the new songs.
1145328	1147510	You don't really change much for roster updates.
1148291	1148751	Well,
1149505	1155807	But, you know, even the sports games do get some new modes, you know, for their respective games just once in a while.
1155847	1156987	Just like the dance games, you know.
1157648	1162829	For instance, we know that in the new Xbox ones, we're going to have the non-stop mixes and things like that.
1163009	1164930	All right.
1165430	1165930	That's my thoughts.
1166270	1168831	Well, we also got another email from Rini.
1170471	1175093	And it's a fairly long one, so just to sort of paraphrase a bit, it's going into...
1175822	1179763	More innovation in the DDR series of games.
1181004	1181984	But I'm going to start from here.
1182064	1184005	Actually, I want to read the first one just because it was really nice.
1184565	1187346	Good day to OLR and happy belated episode 203.
1187886	1191027	May you have another 396 more at this point and beyond.
1192248	1192948	That was really sweet.
1192988	1193328	Thank you.
1194268	1204692	So to continue on toward the middle part of this letter, there was some discussion going on in the Aaron in Japan and DDR UK forums that started to see what users had in mind
1205185	1208327	for some realistic and reasonable feature additions that can be added to DDR.
1208367	1212149	I'll try to make things brisk with a few suggestions made by the community.
1212669	1217052	Preview background mode and steps at the song wheel and maybe at the modifier screen.
1217652	1231060	Challenge steps for every song in the sense that they would not only give something for expert players but would also bring out the full potential of the song according to Konami so that we don't have the boring as hell licenses from the arcade supernova that has gaps of nothing for no reason.
1232384	1236507	Wave Break, 0.25 and half speed, why hasn't Konami put these in?
1236907	1241710	If Vulture Mix 3 allows 0.5 speed and phantom modifiers, then why can't the PS2 versions have them?
1242671	1251116	Custom courses set on a home version can be used at the arcade with the ability to include any song available on the arcade machine.
1251616	1259001	Also should have a maximum of 4 songs on non-stop mode to allow modifiers and a max of 5 songs on challenge mode that disallows modifiers for these courses.
1259608	1261730	Trade edit data online and at the arcade.
1261891	1265995	Submit arcade score data online through a home version by way of memory card.
1267377	1268458	Those are some good suggestions.
1269619	1278669	They are, you know, they are good suggestions and certainly we've thought, you know, through the show, many years we've been doing the show, a lot of you guys when you've called in said very similar things.
1279158	1280018	Thanks for watching!
1309392	1311613	I would think that maybe we're going to get another arcade release.
1311873	1312213	I don't know.
1312333	1315834	I think either way it's inevitable we're going to see Supernova 2 or something like that next year.
1315914	1320275	Because with the leftover songs that you didn't get from the arcade this year at least.
1321416	1325357	I am going to put this one up on our site, but there is a last paragraph on here.
1326397	1334360	And by the way, the emails that I post are going to be on the live show discussion area on our forums.
1335074	1335234	Well...
1363406	1373574	Fake Boobs in Playboy OLR's enemy, G4, is finally mostly gone Yes, I know the words G4 are banned from OLR but for now we might not need to talk about them much anymore
1394271	1399318	This is all I'm going to say on this because you're right, those words are banned from this network.
1402322	1406007	I think a lot of people are saying it's definitely the doom and gloom of the network.
1406848	1410173	I think it's more the doom and gloom of the network as a gaming network.
1410632	1411433	Thanks for watching!
1429665	1433329	That channel has not been a gaming channel for the past 18 months.
1433849	1434670	Where have you been?
1435210	1437272	This is still not news.
1437653	1440035	So what they're doing a corporate restructuring around there.
1440195	1441256	It's not going to save them.
1441836	1444559	Flush that shit down the toilet and be done with it.
1444699	1448022	There is a quote on here, though, that I knew it from the get-go.
1448502	1449644	I do agree with the vision.
1449864	1455549	This is actually a quote from the Ian Stile chief, Ted Harbert.
1456880	1460381	I do agree with the vision of going after young men more than going after gaming.
1460721	1462902	Gaming has been demonstrated as being too narrow.
1464103	1465103	Narrow my ass!
1467724	1468824	There are a lot of gamers out there.
1468904	1469584	Text email, please.
1471105	1476107	Just more... No offense to the men listening and the men in the room, but stupid men.
1476547	1476807	Anyway.
1477687	1477907	Well.
1479008	1479868	I didn't mean you guys.
1479888	1483950	You guys are fairly liberated in your mental states, and so are our listeners.
1484850	1485130	Kisses.
1486107	1486687	Is that all the email?
1486887	1487128	No!
1487408	1488508	Oh, well then get to the next one.
1488688	1489489	We're out of time here.
1490029	1491310	Yeah, my voice is running out.
1492690	1493371	Hey, OLR.
1493511	1494672	This, by the way, comes from Kenji.
1495772	1499434	So, I just picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and I cannot emphasize this enough.
1499554	1502956	It is definitely a must-buy if you've got a hookup to the Wi-Fi connection.
1503536	1510280	Even though the bowling physics are awful, you can't go all in, and you can bet yourself out of a negative chip score.
1510780	1514482	Playing 9-ball is similar to playing the game underwater or in space, take your pick.
1514935	1517056	You can't deny the infinite replayability of this game.
1517376	1519297	Also, you can pick to chat via Wi-Fi.
1519838	1521939	It can only be, however, on matches with your friends.
1521979	1526421	And, of course, you can pick to via local wireless play and chat with your present messages on WorldFi Wi-Fi.
1526501	1527942	So, DMN lied to us last week?
1529382	1531283	Of course, he had the game before most people.
1531463	1534385	He had the game before most people, so he probably didn't have friends on Wi-Fi yet.
1534405	1534925	So, that makes sense.
1534945	1536106	That makes me want to buy the game, though.
1537246	1537446	Why?
1538067	1538847	Dirty Wi-Fi.
1539407	1540248	Dirty Wi-Fi chat?
1540628	1541448	Yeah, that would be fun.
1542029	1542329	Anyway...
1542941	1546564	It is because of the awesomeness of this game that I come to you with a request, nay, a favor.
1547184	1553289	I wanted to make an OLR Clubhouse Games Night where we all exchange friend codes, make a date and time, and basically play the night away.
1553689	1559213	Perhaps you'd all like to participate, you being Jamie, Skye, and Loki, and you also being the rest of the people listening.
1560034	1565278	At long last, Picto-chatting Drop 4 Biatch can become a reality, but only with your help.
1566013	1567814	I've left a post in the forums for anyone who's interested.
1567894	1568734	As always, love the show.
1568814	1569155	Kenji.
1569415	1582881	Just so you know, I did see that post earlier in the week, and I actually just moved it to the OL Army forums because it's kind of fit a little more with that because we try to create teams in certain games that will follow the cardinal rule of the OL Army is don't be a dick.
1583261	1590685	So we just want people to join up that just want to have fun and not try to have that elitist attitude or like, you know, my plus four sword can beat your plus two sword.
1591105	1591526	Who cares?
1591826	1593047	Get in the game and have fun with it.
1593087	1594448	Put your plus four sword in your pants.
1594468	1595428	That's exactly right.
1595488	1598991	So I actually moved that post over to the OL Army and I posted my code there.
1599071	1600652	So if you want to add, that would be cool.
1601132	1603594	And certainly we could set up a night for gaming.
1604275	1608818	Maybe it could be a tie-in with one of the live shows that we do during the week because a lot of people don't know.
1608978	1610179	There are shows we do on Orange Launch Radio.
1610199	1612901	We don't podcast because we like to be a live radio network.
1613743	1619304	DarkSakura has her thing on Tuesdays and I have a show on Wednesdays and there may be more shows coming soon.
1619764	1624125	We know Loki's got something in the works and there's something else I'm trying to get on board.
1624166	1624546	We'll see.
1625326	1635048	Also coming from GS191, we got a really long email but I thought it was very cool and have posted it on that thread that I mentioned prior on there so I'd
1635529	1637290	You'd love to get some discussion started up on that.
1637650	1640631	The other emails that I was going to post up to you will be coming.
1640731	1645073	It's just been, like I said, I've had a sinus infection the last week, so I haven't really done much of anything.
1645093	1645913	Excuses, excuses.
1646233	1646674	I'm kidding.
1647414	1648714	Would you like the sinus infection?
1648854	1649255	Not really.
1649295	1650935	I would love to see you on erythromycin.
1652176	1652496	Not really.
1652756	1654797	Okay, and I would really love to see you on erythromycin.
1655557	1657818	Just, you know, he who shall not be named.
1658838	1659859	Anything else for emails?
1659879	1660079	Yes!
1660632	1662474	God damn, we got a lot of emails this week.
1663074	1663575	They love us.
1664656	1664936	One more.
1665136	1666237	Last email, we gotta keep moving.
1666397	1666598	Yes.
1667338	1668920	This is the one that came on through Myspace.
1669700	1670861	Ah, okay, yes, I remember this one.
1671082	1672083	This is a Myspace message.
1672103	1673464	Gally from Breakdown Radio.
1674545	1676066	Hey guys, Gally here from the Breakdown.
1676106	1678428	I'm a big fan of the show and you guys rock soars big time.
1678949	1682552	Sorry I didn't send this to your mailbag, but I think I'm being yelled at by the boss right now.
1682652	1683293	Damn the man.
1684028	1689072	Anyway, with all this talk of the Wii 60 going down, do you guys think it's a smart move on a personal level?
1689553	1694156	Do you guys already have 360s, but try and look at it from the perspective of a gamer who has neither yet?
1694937	1704925	Do you think it would be a wise move to do the Wii 60, stick with one of the two, or is the last alternative, which I highly doubt because of Sakura's crayon-eating references, holding out for the PS3?
1706001	1706542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1726187	1726747	DarkSakura.com
1738450	1745315	But if you are not rich and you only have the choice, you know, do I want to get a PS3 or do I want to do the Wii 60 thing?
1745675	1747476	Or hell, can I really only pick one of these?
1747876	1751599	You know, you really have to consider what games do you want to play.
1752139	1759324	And I think especially right now between Wii and Xbox 360, there's vastly different games available on the two systems.
1759664	1766629	So you really have to ask yourself, am I wanting to do the wavy controller, Elebits, Zelda, WarioWare type of game?
1767289	1779413	or do I want to get online and play Gears of War and soon Halo 3 and maybe some games like Enchanted Arms or NFL, NBA type games that are available on Xbox 360.
1779733	1780774	You really have to consider.
1781694	1789897	And then the way PlayStation 3 works into it is that even though a lot of games that we're hearing are kind of the same things we saw on Xbox 360, i.e.
1790097	1795699	Oblivion and so on, they are going to have their own games eventually that stand out.
1796581	1806362	My personal mindset is that you don't need to get a PlayStation 3 right out the gate, but I say that because for me, there's no games on this yet that I have to have.
1807020	1809541	A year from now, I'm probably going to feel a lot differently.
1809641	1813522	By the time Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4 start hitting the market, you know what?
1813582	1815422	I'm probably going to be Sony fanboy all over again.
1815722	1818103	But as far as the launch goes, I'm not really sold.
1818423	1825984	So if you think you're going to have some money now and then more money in a year and PlayStation 3 doesn't have the lineup for you right now, do what I'm doing.
1826425	1833866	Buy the Wii now so you have your Wii 6 because I bought the Xbox 360 six months ago so it's spaced out enough where this isn't a huge financial impact.
1834166	1836587	Buy the Wii when it comes out and then buy the PlayStation 3 later down the line.
1837079	1864007	but you know again it's up to you and what games you want to play and there's no real clear answer we can give we can only tell you based on what we play but there's going to be so many fanboys that say no you have to have one of these on launch because you have to have Lair and Warhawk and Six Axes for Life and yada yada yada but it's all about what you want well from my perspective I'm getting them all anyway so I'd say if you can get them all get them all that way you're not limited
1866439	1892564	Actdeft says I've said it before and I'll say it again I'll get a 360 just to play Uno you might be being sarcastic but you're really wasting your time if that's all you want because you can play it for free on Zone MSN or hell Clubhouse Games has something just like it so if now you must have strip Uno with the webcam well I suppose the 360 is the only place you can do that I don't know Rama says PlayStation 3 will be bringing it back to the store after it breaks in 20 minutes hey you know what
1893286	1894467	That's something to be said, too.
1894587	1897349	Maybe you don't want to get a first-generation worth of console.
1897389	1899210	I learned my lesson with the Xbox 360.
1899250	1902392	Go back and listen to some episodes around February when I bought my Xbox 360.
1902772	1905454	The damn thing broke when I bought it, and I was pissed.
1905934	1911198	And I was going to go torch down Microsoft, but since then they fixed it for free, and I've been a happy boy.
1912258	1913819	I did also want to make an announcement, though.
1914059	1914220	What?
1916141	1918282	For Pump Up the Volume, actually, this week.
1918422	1919243	Your Tuesday show, yes.
1919263	1919423	Yes.
1920043	1921044	Excuse me.
1921428	1923229	There will be a delay on the show.
1923729	1926191	It will be starting around 7.30 to 8 this week.
1927912	1930053	Just wanted to go ahead and make a mention that I am doing it.
1930974	1931274	All right.
1931474	1933755	So come listen to the other live programming on Orange Launch Radio.
1935036	1935837	All done with the mailbag?
1935857	1938979	Yeah.
1939259	1940520	Okay.
1940580	1942301	Moving on to more gaming news.
1943141	1947024	There's a movie called 8-Bit under development.
1947524	1947724	Huh.
1948697	1957350	According to VH1's Game Break, quote, this movie is about how games affect our culture, how the genre crosses the culture to influence music, art, and the way we think.
1957811	1963580	In 8-bit, artists invade the online shooter Counter-Strike to add messages of peace on walls with paintball guns.
1963940	1964380	Thanks for watching!
1989511	1991432	It's kind of weird that I've never heard of any of this stuff.
1991472	1993053	Well, I mean, I've heard of the music, certainly.
1993113	1997354	We know a lot of those bands, but I haven't heard of any of those other art projects, so that might be worth checking out.
1997374	1998135	I've heard the Game Boy one.
1998415	1998635	Really?
1998675	2000576	Well, yeah, yeah, the Game Boy music one, yeah.
2000616	2009240	We've also had bands that use the type of... I'm talking about like the Counter-Strike, Grandpa and the Fire thing, and the whole... those sort of things.
2009260	2010200	I've never heard of that before.
2010420	2011261	That might be interesting.
2011961	2016683	Well, shooting paintballs into a wall does not make for a winning team.
2017430	2021411	But when it's, you know, it's an interesting kind of art form when it's done in a game, huh?
2021931	2022232	Maybe?
2023392	2025072	It's very unique.
2026193	2039377	But it's also kind of neat, and it's one of the rumors that's going to be coming soon, and you might actually be able to watch 8-Bit on this, that Microsoft might be adding Xvid and DivX support to the 360 in the fall dashboard update.
2040017	2045619	Now, no idea whether it's true or not, but the news actually comes from
2048299	2052322	A developers conference that was going on actually.
2053583	2068194	Some Dutch colleagues from xlife.nl were invited to a training session for shop employees and basically kind of just talking a little bit about technology and stuff.
2068672	2079235	And one of the questions that was asked basically at the event, they had a talk with the host and asked him whether there's going to be DivX or Xvid support in the future or other codecs.
2079775	2085936	And he said that it was something that Microsoft was working hard to implement and a firmware update is expected within two months.
2087277	2088897	So we'll have to see.
2088977	2091218	That might be rumor for now.
2092438	2094459	But it would make sense if they supported something like that.
2094539	2095699	I don't know if they will, though.
2096812	2104876	Something that's not a rumor is a new multiplayer mode for Red Steel is going to be called Killer Mode.
2104996	2112819	It's a special multiplayer setup, so you'll use your mission brief via the speaker in the Wiimote.
2113279	2114680	So, this is a B.
2115438	2125627	Yeah, I was hearing something about this, that, like, basically, like, I think the Wiimote is supposed to ring, and so you put it up to your ear, and it'll actually whisper, like, you know, This is Snake.
2125807	2131071	Yeah, you need, no, it says something like, you need to kill player four and do not kill the other players, or something like that.
2131391	2134674	Like, it gives you your mission in a little speaker so the other people don't know what your mission is.
2134714	2135335	That's pretty cool.
2135355	2136736	That is damn innovative, isn't it?
2137156	2137677	That's pretty fun.
2137717	2138277	I like that.
2138878	2139658	That is pretty cool.
2140579	2141340	That's innovation.
2141620	2142080	I like that.
2142841	2143121	Mm-hmm.
2143682	2143962	All right.
2144434	2146275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2166391	2166951	XBOX LIVE ARCADE
2183940	2186841	And this, I think, is going to be kind of very similar to that.
2186941	2190222	They're going to be talking a little bit more, I think, about releasing games.
2190382	2197264	Like, you know, you see some of the stuff, not necessarily old games on Xbox Live Arcade, but newer games that are small, maybe for that kind of setup.
2197304	2202206	Yeah, I don't see this really replacing the current distribution we have now.
2202246	2209528	But it's interesting because, you know, you've heard a lot of talk about this whole digital distribution moving on into the next gaming area, especially on PlayStation 3 as well.
2210329	2210949	There's a quote here.
2210969	2211829	Let me read this real fast.
2212362	2216006	And this is from, I believe this is from Nintendo themselves.
2216326	2226076	Beginning in Spring 2007, Nintendo will apparently begin the Wii Compact Software line of games which will allow players to download certain Wii titles to their console rather than purchasing a disc.
2226376	2230020	Pricing and storage details, as well as what software will be made available, not provided.
2230623	2231263	and New Cables and Whatnot.
2260987	2280537	So anyways, there's some interesting stuff also coming out about the Wii, and I know one of the stories that was run during the week when talking about how Sunlight was causing a problem with the Wii remotes where it was interfering with the IR field that the actual receiver and emitters were putting out.
2281260	2286003	Well, apparently Nintendo has commented on that, and they said that it's not a major issue.
2286124	2292548	It says, our testing thus far shows no great risk of light interference while playing a game that relies on the pointer and sensor bar.
2293449	2302175	And so, you know, granted, that's going to be about as much interference as having, you know, bright light shining on your TV or something like that.
2303036	2304417	That won't really interfere with it.
2305097	2307279	I'm, you know, kind of on the fence with this.
2307319	2308680	I guess we'll have to see when it comes out.
2309318	2310138	But you know what, though?
2310579	2319643	If there's anything to be learned from this, especially from the eye toy and from the Xbox Live Vision camera, my house is always too dark.
2319943	2322964	So I don't think too much light is ever going to be a problem.
2324145	2327226	JeremyTub1 in chat says, Who gives a shit if sunlight affects it?
2327246	2328207	You aren't playing outside.
2328547	2330668	If it's shining through a window, close the freaking blinds.
2331628	2334550	Minini283 says, Everyone plays games in their basements anyway.
2336010	2337111	No, I play in my living room.
2337131	2337351	Huh.
2338643	2340243	I think it was a joke about nerds there.
2363752	2372640	This website of the week was actually one given to me by our dear friend and listener, Rob with two B's.
2373120	2374041	I'll spell it out.
2374241	2381447	It's theca.com, which is for the Entertainment Consumers Association.
2385912	2394602	The Entertainment Consumers Association is a non-profit membership organization established to serve the needs of those who play computer and video games.
2395623	2401530	Formed in 2006, the ECA is an advocacy organization for consumers of interactive entertainment.
2402476	2404017	You can actually sign up for their site.
2404037	2405078	They have things to win.
2405118	2408100	They also have lots of information.
2408160	2409601	Links to game politics, too.
2410181	2412263	Seems that there's a little bit of an affiliation there.
2413384	2415025	Just lots of really good stuff.
2415125	2420568	FAQs, news, just things that are going on as far as our legal rights as gamers.
2422149	2423750	In fact, there's another blurb on here.
2423770	2431896	It says, Today, more than ever before, gamers need to stand together to defend against political activity that is threatening the creation and publishing of video games.
2432751	2440620	On behalf of the gaming community, the ECA lobbies legislators directly as well as launching grassroots digital initiatives to preserve our rights as gamers.
2441581	2442462	What was that link again?
2443062	2445905	It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com.
2447367	2448548	Alright, check it out boys and girls.
2448869	2450170	Definitely, I'll be linking it in the chat room.
2451591	2459737	All right, well, GameTap is a service we've mentioned a few times on this show, and it's, you know, still getting a little steam, a few more subscribers every now and then.
2460217	2468343	Well, they have launched a 500-player beta of Uru Live, which you might know also as the Myst Online Project.
2468643	2475588	And this is a pretty big deal, because what happened is the project was abandoned, and then GameTap has kind of picked it up and ran with it, so it's kind of interesting.
2476625	2488375	Gay Gamer recently ran a report on this, and they said this, quote, GameTap has improved the game with new sound support and a new physics engine that makes it much easier and faster to interact with others, something that bogged down the original game.
2488755	2494920	And if things go as planned, Uru Live may begin to incorporate content generated by its incredibly creative player community.
2495240	2495421	Hmm.
2495921	2496261	Interesting.
2496341	2496982	That's pretty cool.
2497082	2500625	I hope they keep doing more stuff like that and supporting smaller games and maybe helping in
2501515	2503397	Some PC games get published and stuff like that.
2503417	2508061	I think what's kind of neat about that too is that you're paying essentially the GameTap fee for access to all this.
2508081	2511783	So if they get more MMOs, it's kind of like you're paying one fee for all these MMOs.
2511844	2513585	And GameTap is relatively cheap.
2514245	2516307	It's the same price they're charging for Phantasy Star Universe.
2518209	2521051	I don't want to sound like a commercial because I've already been accused of being on their payroll.
2523793	2528657	I actually pay the $10 a month for GameTap, which is sad because I rarely ever use it because I'm just so
2529310	2532473	I check it out like once every other week or so to see what's new.
2532973	2535115	But this is something I definitely will check out.
2535735	2536736	I'm very curious.
2537336	2539818	Obviously I can't get into beta, but when it's released.
2540519	2552128	Anyways, this week Unfettered Blather, a blogging site, actually ran a top ten list of the top ten things about next gen that are annoying.
2552628	2555070	So let's go off the list here.
2555090	2557352	The big highlights, of course, number one,
2558476	2559997	Sony's alternate reality.
2560137	2563358	No matter how you spin it, we just want a game console first.
2563458	2565499	Go push your format war somewhere else.
2566139	2570061	Number two, dual price skew nonsense with the new next-gen console.
2570081	2570761	You know what, though?
2571542	2576944	If you read those stories about people who are pre-ordering the PS3, some of them were doing it because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.
2577144	2579925	I don't know if number one has as much validity as people think.
2580666	2580986	I don't know.
2581446	2581706	Anyways.
2582433	2585014	Cost between consoles and computers vanishing.
2585514	2589856	$60 games, expensive peripherals, consoles being released at $600 price points.
2590977	2600340	Chasing Nintendo says you just can't ignore the changes in industry, but sure fun watching these two megacorporations scramble to keep up with Nintendo's ideas.
2601821	2603942	And other fun stuff, they're also on there.
2605042	2611225	Mainly repeating the $60 game thing, and name changes, like they're saying the Revolution was a better name, and
2612013	2614194	That $60 game thing should have been number one.
2614254	2615755	That's the most annoying, if anything.
2616396	2616876	Come on.
2616896	2620318	$60 would have made my list.
2620918	2623260	We haven't really seen that whole Gran Turismo thing, though.
2623300	2625781	I don't think we've really seen what exactly is going to come of that.
2625821	2626241	You know what I mean?
2628022	2628382	Interesting.
2629063	2629363	Alright.
2630484	2636427	Well, if you have more annoying things, you could maybe write this guy and maybe he'll do an extended list in the future.
2637492	2645016	Well, in other news, in regards to, you know, we had brought up there was going to be a Castlevania movie, right?
2646216	2649217	Well, it's going to be written by Warren Ellis.
2649838	2650598	Pretty cool, huh?
2651198	2654080	But also, it is going to be direct-to-DVD.
2655680	2656121	I don't know.
2657401	2658942	Direct-to-DVD, that's not good.
2660097	2662137	There have been some good things put direct to DVD.
2662177	2664638	Well, it kind of seems to be one place the movie industry is going.
2664658	2667259	You have all these god-awful sequels going direct to DVD.
2667339	2670700	Why not, you know, something kind of, you know, new, unique?
2671420	2674180	Unless you saw Van Helsing, which was kind of Castlevania the movie in a way.
2675101	2675961	Not really, just kidding.
2676501	2687804	Well, at any rate, there's a quote on here saying, for an entity currently known only as Project 51's productions, a production blog will follow on the official site.
2688564	2688844	So...
2690740	2693341	We just keep our eyes on it to see what happens.
2694181	2695842	All right.
2695862	2696782	Well, I'll rent it.
2697083	2698363	I'll put it in my Netflix queue.
2698383	2701764	But having him write it, that's like fangasm right there.
2701784	2702925	I don't know.
2703185	2708207	It's supposed to be the... By the way, it is the animated Castlevania thing that we were talking about before.
2708507	2710588	So animated movie, that wouldn't be too bad, I guess.
2710608	2711869	This is not live action.
2713089	2714810	After all, they are making BloodRayne 2.
2714850	2717591	I mean, God, do we really need more video game movies like that?
2717671	2718991	But I don't know.
2719612	2720372	It should be pretty cool.
2721849	2722710	Okay, here we go.
2722750	2725512	He worked on, he basically was a comic writer.
2726613	2733097	Did some work for, I actually did remember that he did work for Excalibur because I've read Excalibur from its beginning incarnation on.
2734018	2743345	Did DV8, which was a Gen 13 spinoff, Stormwatch, The Authority, did some stuff for Vertigo, Transmetropolitan was one.
2745767	2751211	Also, did, was working on the Counter-X line of titles for Marvel.
2752947	2757789	X-Men, X-Force, Avatar Comics, Homage Comics, South Park
2781792	2782933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2812045	2821627	I do want to point out, I watched this week's episode of South Park, and for those folks that heard my review of the WoW episode of South Park last week, that satire I said was missing, that was in this week's episode.
2821647	2823828	This week's episode of South Park was freaking hilarious.
2823868	2825748	I laughed my ass off.
2826748	2828489	I just have a fucked up sense of humor.
2828509	2828989	What can I say?
2829669	2833570	Don't you think that they probably did that stuff on purpose, or just didn't really give a crap?
2833650	2834410	I'm pretty sure they did.
2835490	2836090	Ah, bathroom.
2836810	2840611	So then there's another wonderful rumor going around the interweb this week.
2841055	2846020	That would be that the sword featured in the actual episode of South Park was a real sword.
2846360	2852626	Sword of the 1000 Truths is supposed to be winnable in the arena matches in Burning Crusade.
2854167	2858992	Some people think that it's an obvious Photoshop, but who knows?
2859032	2862275	I guess we'll see when Burning Crusade hits stores.
2863316	2864357	That's kind of interesting, though.
2865897	2867798	It actually wouldn't surprise me if that were true.
2867939	2869700	I actually don't think that's a fanboy thing.
2869740	2875384	I think that could actually be true because that episode of South Park felt like such this huge infomercial.
2875864	2877645	It would be the perfect tie-in.
2878086	2884950	Well, it was funny, though, because some of the stats were a little bit different from the actual cartoon.
2885351	2887993	Of course, it says 197 to 296 damage, 88 damage per second, plus 21 stamina.
2895049	2895730	Requires level 70.
2895850	2900434	It says equip improves hit rating by 8, improves critical strike rating by 14.
2900494	2903757	Why don't you go post that on Wikipedia, you damn nerd?
2904077	2905779	It doesn't match what was in the show.
2906460	2907901	No, they already posted that on Wikipedia.
2907941	2908902	Oh, I see.
2909523	2912285	So, that'd be interesting to see if that's going to actually be coming out.
2912305	2913146	I don't know.
2914908	2919392	Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, looks like those WoW nerds during the correcting needs a clue.
2919772	2920392	I got a clue.
2920532	2921493	I got a raging clue.
2921633	2922614	My clue is over there.
2922734	2923354	Let's go there.
2923795	2925616	Oh my, clue goo.
2925656	2926557	That's a raging clue.
2927197	2927557	I get it.
2927878	2930139	It's a joke about the South Park from this week.
2930219	2930640	That's funny.
2931560	2932221	Good job, listeners.
2932341	2932641	Good job.
2934122	2936964	Yeah, well, you know what?
2937164	2940647	You are on an internet radio program about video games.
2942008	2942748	Hi, you're black.
2942788	2943529	Hey, hey, hey.
2944805	2947307	I calls them as I sees them, dude.
2947908	2954152	Well, you remember my allusion to the Phantom earlier in Part A?
2954172	2955113	Yes.
2955333	2956354	Pay attention, listeners.
2957175	2959697	Well, I was giving foreshadowing.
2961518	2964080	Yeah, they actually are starting to sell something for Phantom.
2964801	2965461	Isn't that funny?
2966702	2972567	They have been showing off this thing called the Phantom Wireless Lapboard and Phantom Wireless Laser Mouse.
2974264	2980447	The two together are basically just a way to sit on your ass and browse the internet with a keyboard.
2980567	2988350	It's like Web TV, only with a swivel keyboard thing and a piece of hard plastic underneath it.
2988550	2990251	So is this the next generation of gaming?
2990811	2991471	My ass.
2993252	2995753	Like I said, Web TV, we've had this shit before.
2997394	2997834	But I...
2999790	3000650	and DarkSakura.
3019625	3029613	The Get Well Gamers Foundation, it's another nice charity that was posted about a little bit earlier this week on GayGamer.net, quote,
3036818	3037239	DarkSakura.com
3059295	3063818	and this is the pretty cool thing is that you can actually donate your old games.
3064158	3072764	So, you know, games you might think are old and outdated and you're never going to play anymore, like instead of throwing a Nintendo 64 in the garbage, you could donate it to a charity like this.
3073004	3079489	Hey, listen, if you've watched fucking Mind Mancia, you would know that nobody wants a Nintendo 64 anymore.
3079509	3082991	I would just like to point out, in this picture, on this site...
3083706	3086087	There is a child, a sick child, you're playing a Nintendo 64.
3086147	3087767	Haven't he suffered enough?
3087787	3089487	You heartless bastard.
3090247	3093468	Hey, hey, I still love Pokemon Snap.
3093728	3094468	Me too.
3094528	3096409	And Mario 64 is the shit.
3097389	3098769	I also threw away a PlayStation.
3100330	3101370	Well, I've done that.
3101510	3103370	I have a stack of five of them in my back room.
3103390	3104911	You heartless both of you.
3105531	3106111	They don't work.
3107171	3107611	Oh, come on.
3107651	3109532	If it's broken, then it's broken.
3109832	3112634	One of our old ones, it will still sort of work.
3112674	3116996	You have to tilt it sideways at a 45 degree angle for it to read the discs right.
3117336	3118637	Maybe I'll donate mine to this charity.
3118657	3120878	I don't really play my Nintendo 64.
3120918	3121899	My Nintendo 64 was broken.
3121939	3123980	It was all blurry and the polygons were simple.
3124040	3124880	See, now you're making it up.
3125200	3126141	Now you're just making stuff up.
3127061	3129022	If I'm going to play Nintendo 64, I'll play my DS.
3129923	3130543	Exactly.
3131352	3133814	Anyway, just admit you're a bad person and get to the next story.
3133914	3137196	I am a bad person, and I have no problems with that.
3137256	3138757	You're a bad, bad man.
3139538	3144582	Listen, if it comes, I'm getting my Wii, and I ain't donating shit.
3145042	3145743	That's my Wii.
3146443	3148645	They're gonna, whatever, I'm not gonna say anymore.
3149185	3149665	Anyways.
3149685	3150526	You're gonna get cancer.
3150866	3151907	That's just what's gonna happen.
3152447	3152928	It's karma.
3153828	3155049	You're gonna die in a fire.
3155069	3157491	You know you really want a 64DD?
3162395	3164717	I think we really need to go to the next story at this point.
3165538	3169501	Okay, look, we've got one foot in hell, so let's please go to the next story.
3170301	3174925	Anyways, because in hell, if you throw water on the ground, you're going to get steam.
3175245	3179329	That's my transition, because steam is getting a lot more cool games coming to it.
3180169	3186194	And one of those games is a fan favorite, Psychonauts, and that's kind of neat.
3187819	3191381	and, of course, other things that you're going to be seeing on Steam other than Psychonauts.
3191481	3194082	And Psychonauts, by the way, is just going to be about $20.
3194463	3206329	You're also going to see such wonderful games like Call of Duty 2, as well as some other Activision titles, Call of Duty, Call of Duty United Offensive, and Gun.
3206789	3213212	Those are also going to be coming, as well as the brand new game that will also be coming to Xbox Live Arcade someday.
3214033	3215954	Rebel Blitz is also making its way.
3216394	3216654	So...
3217153	3218774	Lots of fun stuff for Steam.
3221156	3222777	They should do a game called Call of Booty.
3225439	3225999	Or porn.
3226260	3227861	They have World of Porncraft.
3227881	3229142	They should definitely have Call of Booty.
3229622	3232004	Well, speaking of World of... You know what?
3232644	3233625	I should... Okay.
3234325	3237288	I have this great entrepreneur idea here.
3237628	3240290	We're going to share with the entire internet.
3240330	3240730	I don't know.
3241050	3241771	Patent pending.
3241831	3242291	It's mine.
3242351	3242852	Trademarked.
3242872	3243952	You steal this, I sue you.
3244032	3244553	Okay, here it is.
3246366	3253273	Make a porn company that does nothing but video game tie-ins like that.
3253473	3255275	I think there's an audience out there for that.
3255656	3259540	And we could do both gay, straight, lesbo, whatever, everything.
3259580	3260621	Trisexual, it doesn't matter.
3260661	3262663	Furries, sure, we'll find something for you guys too.
3262983	3263864	Pokemon or something.
3264184	3265946	Maybe like Banjo-Kazooie.
3266847	3267427	Porn.
3267748	3267868	Porn.
3292288	3294630	FinalFuckX, who doesn't remember that one?
3294650	3296111	That was a great Japanese import.
3296151	3299433	No, we need some good domestically made... Really good cosplay.
3299453	3304216	Bring me your whores and your sluts and let's put them in some video game porn.
3304556	3307758	I'll make them stars and make a lot of money in the process.
3307878	3309519	Remember, strippers are people too.
3309979	3310720	Naked people.
3313522	3314722	Anyway, next story, right?
3316523	3318765	Back to the world of SomethingCraft...
3319833	3320373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3343425	3344786	Sorry, it's the chat room.
3345326	3346427	Finish your story, then I'll go back.
3346467	3347387	No, just tell me.
3348108	3350269	Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.
3350429	3352310	I saw that at a store last week.
3352330	3355652	Now they're going off on all these movies that we could make here.
3355692	3357913	We have DMN says Super Princess Penis.
3359074	3361475	DMN says Conker's Bad Furry Day.
3362316	3372281	Mantic says Crash Bandicunt, DMN says Elite Beat Off Agents, and Bandit says simply Paris Hilton's Gem Quest.
3373681	3374922	That's basically porn anyway.
3375502	3376303	You guys are awesome.
3377083	3378624	Well, back to my story.
3379484	3380645	Dirty-minded listeners.
3382145	3384306	Chrome Horse.
3384506	3385167	Good one, Travis.
3385307	3385987	Travis, yes.
3387196	3388937	No more porn, no more porn, sorry.
3388977	3395358	They finished the first step of the character transfer and paid everything on the credit card.
3396199	3398179	They said it would take 12 hours to move it.
3398219	3403621	They checked again, 12 hours again, 12 hours later, they checked again, and still another 12 hours.
3404101	3406961	And people on the forums were bitching up a storm.
3408002	3412003	And actually, there was a...
3413657	3417581	They were basically putting the same old cut-and-paste response on the forum.
3417641	3420683	Blah, blah, blah, this is normal, working as intended, my butt.
3421283	3422104	You know, that type of thing.
3423085	3429550	And they said no one could resolve it by working with their customer service.
3430211	3435295	It was suggested canceling the transfer and starting again, and no one else had any luck with it.
3436275	3436515	So...
3439400	3439900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3459554	3463358	and it was redoing it over and over and over.
3463378	3467982	So they encouraged them to retry it, yet it was withdrawing 20 euros every time.
3468022	3469623	It looks like it was retrying it on its own.
3469783	3470224	Oh, nice.
3471245	3480193	So it wasn't charging credit cards, like I said, but it was charging debit accounts and draining people's bank accounts.
3481094	3483736	So Blizzard hasn't...
3485723	3491648	They said that it hasn't worked for about eight days and Blizzard finally came out and said something about it.
3491748	3496912	But there has not been a statement issued by Blizzard.
3497593	3501456	There hasn't been an ETA as to when they're going to get that fixed.
3501756	3506200	As I understand it, though, this is only screwing over the Euro banks, not American transfers.
3506220	3507140	That's what I'm seeing right here.
3507941	3508341	Oh, sorry.
3509122	3514386	But they can't just be so closed-mouthed about this.
3514466	3515147	They have to be
3516403	3519305	They are going to lose so much freaking business.
3519746	3526171	On top of that, there's any type of number of suits are going to come up over just how much money they've taken from these bank accounts.
3527833	3529714	They've really screwed themselves with this.
3531296	3534218	When you see it happening, you stop the service.
3534999	3536040	You do it right then.
3537529	3539430	DarkSakura, would you watch a movie called Slut Caliber 3?
3539470	3539691	Hell yeah!
3570666	3572487	Blackboy says Super Monkey Ball, touch and roll.
3573127	3573707	That sounds fun.
3573727	3575508	I thought that was a game.
3576268	3577428	Super Monkey Ball, touch and roll.
3577448	3578509	Yeah, but it could be a porn, too.
3578589	3582510	Sorry, I promised we wouldn't do any more of the porn.
3582530	3583870	But some of them are just so damn funny.
3583910	3584471	What can I say?
3585191	3586191	Skype line's open.
3587232	3587952	You can call us.
3588052	3589492	Go to orangeloungeradio.com.
3589512	3590713	Click on Interact With Us.
3590753	3592653	The username is OrangeloungeRadio.
3592753	3594354	Or you can pick up the telephone and call 916-226-9067.
3597771	3601372	Oh, in the meantime, some quick last minute stories, some things to squeeze in there.
3601412	3602272	I did want to mention this.
3603232	3612974	If you're a fan of the game In the Groove, you can now, this latest update they've done on the machine, you can do your own custom MP3s and steps.
3613234	3619335	So basically now you have, In the Groove has basically come out and legitimized itself as Step Mania in the arcade.
3620355	3621356	There's only one problem though.
3621436	3623336	What are they going to do for audio licensing?
3623922	3630648	Since I'm sure they didn't address that, since the game is not, you know, these are not licensed on the machine.
3631429	3634972	And usually the machine will cover the licensing for the songs that are in the game.
3635012	3642459	But now that place, say if the RIA comes in and hears someone playing, you know, Christina Aguilera or something like that on the machine, they could sue them.
3643460	3645902	Sorry, chat room is correcting me and saying it's actually OGG files.
3645942	3646883	We are starting to get some calls.
3646903	3647843	We'll come back to this in a minute.
3648104	3649025	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3649045	3649365	Who's this?
3650069	3652090	Hi, this is Sephiroth1215 here.
3652470	3653851	Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.
3653871	3654452	What's on your mind?
3656733	3659995	I'm pretty much fresh off of Digital Life.
3660475	3661916	How was Digital Life?
3661976	3663136	Tell us a little bit about this.
3664217	3667559	You know, the first time you get in there, it looks kind of cool.
3667619	3668439	It's nice and big.
3669080	3672442	So much to see, but it's really not that great this year.
3673002	3673242	Really?
3673302	3673762	Why is that?
3675844	3676984	You had some good things.
3677625	3678145	You had some...
3678740	3682083	Maybe a few gaming booths, depending on what you like, though.
3683244	3686728	Now, Digital Life is not exclusively a gaming show, right?
3686768	3687889	There's lots of stuff there.
3688729	3690551	No, there's plenty of stuff there.
3693274	3700220	Probably a lot of the space, though, was from MLG and another gaming league of some sort.
3701321	3702763	Was Sony the best booth there?
3702783	3703864	No.
3704676	3706057	Sony's booth was kind of small.
3706237	3708698	Not to mention it was right next to Microsoft's booth.
3709118	3709399	Really?
3710739	3711640	Did you get your hands on the plate?
3712620	3713881	I got to play the PS3.
3714241	3714401	And?
3715142	3720125	And it played very well from what I got to see.
3720465	3720745	Alright.
3720765	3722706	I played a little bit of Resistance.
3723706	3725908	Okay, that's something they didn't have at E3, I don't think, right?
3726388	3726968	What did you think of it?
3728769	3729230	It was good.
3729750	3733452	I was more so looking at the graphics and the movements of the characters...
3734617	3736738	More so than the gameplay, though.
3737439	3737879	What do you think?
3737939	3739060	Did this sell you on the game?
3739520	3740560	Or on the system, I should say?
3743062	3757810	It proved to me that the system can be more solid than I originally thought because I thought maybe everything was going to be kind of blocky or it wasn't... I don't know how to explain it, really.
3758831	3762513	But I guess just to compare, I got to play the Wii a bit.
3763988	3767189	I played Elebits, and oddly enough, there were problems playing that.
3767649	3768449	Oh, what kind of problems?
3769309	3771230	The controls were off.
3771370	3782373	I mean, you had to stay to the left, and it had the same kind of problem that Sonic did, where you go a little bit, and the cursor goes far off into the screen.
3782613	3784253	Was it just maybe miscalibrated?
3785393	3786053	It might have been.
3786093	3787334	I'm not quite sure.
3787614	3792295	It was only a demo of the game, so it could change later.
3792836	3799181	Not to mention the loading time was way over a minute just to even start the demo.
3800663	3802044	Wow, so that's interesting.
3802084	3809370	Kind of a different reaction than we heard from E3 where everybody was buzzing about the Wii and not so buzzing about the PS3.
3809830	3811692	What do you think was the best thing you saw at Digital Life?
3813473	3818498	Honestly, the best thing at Digital Life was the DDR booth, which is where I was working all weekend.
3819058	3819599	What was there?
3819619	3821180	What was at the DDR booth that made it so great?
3822196	3824556	There's tournaments going on all weekend long.
3825797	3829757	Not to mention we were the only booth that had the best giveaways.
3830858	3831998	What kind of stuff was being given?
3832018	3835458	Oh, that's right, because they do like the $1,000 tournament there or something, right?
3835498	3836298	Like big, big money.
3837999	3844280	Overall, it was about over $8,000 worth of prize money and prizes.
3844300	3846940	I'm kind of pissed I missed New York City by a week.
3846980	3847780	I would have loved to have been there.
3849021	3850441	You know, honestly, it's all right because...
3851755	3864638	From what I hear they're having talks about, it's not completely official yet, so you can't take my word on it, is next year, because there's no more Big E3, there's also going to be a Digital Life in LA.
3865518	3866199	Oh, interesting.
3866779	3867699	We might have to check that out.
3868979	3871060	Are you going to be at Nintendo World Store Saturday at noon?
3871080	3871760	Because I'm going to be there.
3874060	3874341	Yeah.
3874641	3874981	All right.
3876001	3879122	Not to put you on the spot or anything, but if you're not there, I'm going to cry.
3879482	3880002	No, I'm kidding.
3880825	3881666	I might have some CDs.
3881706	3883267	I didn't know you were going to be there Saturday.
3883527	3884568	Oh, did you not hear the part A?
3884608	3886209	Yeah, I'm going to be there Saturday at noon.
3887590	3887870	Okay.
3888050	3888590	All right.
3888630	3889051	I'll be there.
3889311	3889651	All right.
3889991	3890772	Well, we'll see you then.
3890932	3893233	Anything else you want to say for the listeners?
3894694	3895315	No, not really.
3895675	3895975	All right.
3896235	3897836	We'll go to some more calls.
3898017	3899317	Glad to hear you had a good time at Digital Life.
3899458	3899758	Take care.
3900658	3900959	You too.
3901199	3901399	Later.
3901459	3902419	All right.
3902460	3902660	Bye.
3902980	3903160	Bye.
3904195	3904835	Legend of Zaku
3924801	3927023	I'm going to let you in on a little radio secret here, okay?
3927463	3935088	Sometimes we pick up the calls a little bit before I'm ready to acknowledge that you're actually on the line just because it makes for a smoother transition that way.
3935488	3938410	So until we say, Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3938910	3940472	Shh, be quiet.
3940492	3940732	All right.
3941032	3941332	All right.
3941712	3942893	Saku, what's on your mind?
3943574	3945155	Yo, I was also there too, man.
3945195	3946255	I was also at Digital Life.
3946556	3948377	I had a feeling you'd have something to say on Digital Life.
3949337	3950518	As a matter of fact, I competed.
3950858	3952199	I competed in freestyle on Saturday.
3952419	3952880	And how was it?
3953871	3960092	What I'm about to post right now in the chat room is a link to the actual, to my routine.
3960232	3962293	Granted, it was a bad routine.
3962473	3962773	Get it?
3965954	3969215	Yes, you get the get it joke right there.
3970035	3971575	Hold on, I'm actually looking at it right now.
3971755	3974496	Yeah, it was a bad routine.
3975236	3976336	You're looking at the screen!
3978017	3978917	How long did you practice this?
3980504	3982366	I was totally unprepared for this.
3982466	3983928	This was an improv all the way.
3985449	3989233	I was like, yeah, you got some cool alarm movements there, but yeah.
3990134	3992096	Saku, you're looking at the screen too much, buddy.
3992156	3992657	I'm sorry.
3992677	3994458	I know, but it's alright though.
3995359	3999784	I wouldn't care less right now because I had a good time and I have no regrets for that.
3999924	4002667	Did you see somebody left you a comment to go dance on some landmines?
4006698	4007719	Oh, the internet's mean.
4008319	4011021	I also played the Wii.
4011601	4012482	Yeah, what did you think of the Wii?
4014103	4015424	On Elebits, definitely.
4015464	4015924	That was hot.
4016644	4017425	You liked Elebits?
4018145	4019026	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
4019066	4023089	I mean, it was fun for the fact that you could actually aim and move stuff around.
4025410	4026831	It wasn't miscalibrated for you?
4028283	4033506	Yeah, I mean, it was a little jerky, but I had to move a little bit back.
4034866	4038248	Because when I moved up closer, it wasn't even engaging.
4038368	4043551	So the more further away I was from the screen, the more better the controls were.
4044792	4045352	What about PS3?
4045592	4046933	Did you get your little hands on the PS3?
4047373	4050114	No, the lines were pretty long for that.
4050555	4052315	I managed to play Guitar Hero 2 as well.
4052335	4053216	What did you think of that?
4054153	4057735	It's kind of like the same thing, it just has more difficulties.
4057755	4060036	You can select characters and guitars.
4061057	4064358	Here's another last minute story involving Guitar Hero 2 now that you brought it up.
4064378	4065559	Yeah, about the controller.
4065699	4068060	Hey, hey, who's hosting this show?
4068620	4069501	I'm sorry, man.
4069861	4072342	I'm sorry about spilling the beans, as you were.
4072843	4074484	No, you might as well finish your thought.
4074504	4078966	Why don't you go, Zaku, why don't you play OLR Reporter here and tell us this story about Guitar Hero 2.
4080540	4088482	From what's being said is that the demo version is not allowing you to play third-party controllers.
4090423	4099605	So, in other words, this company that essentially made its name on making third-party controllers has locked third-party controllers out of its next game.
4101926	4104167	According to the demo, if the demo is any indication.
4105167	4105567	Alright.
4106887	4108668	Right now I've got to go, but I'll let you know
4109591	4110873	I have some free swag for you.
4110893	4111313	What happened?
4111553	4112054	What's going on?
4112314	4113195	Why do you have to go so fast?
4113456	4115978	Nah, I got some stuff to take care of.
4115998	4119663	I'll let you know if any free swag helps.
4119683	4120784	The cops are there.
4121084	4122987	Alright, Zaku, go tell the cops we said hi.
4128032	4129014	Worst call ever.
4130618	4135380	This is the part in Mr. Robinson's neighborhood that we learn about the word of the day.
4135401	4138262	The word of the day is fire escape.
4138642	4140923	Kids, do you know what a fire escape is?
4141544	4142724	Cabbage patch, kid.
4144665	4145846	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
4145866	4146306	Who's this?
4147267	4148187	Hi, it's Ranma.
4148427	4149068	Hi, Ranma.
4149088	4149828	What's on your mind?
4149848	4150788	Hi, Ranma.
4151709	4153050	Hi, Ocean.
4153810	4154410	Go figure.
4154450	4157712	All the New York City listeners are trying to hammer like mad to get through tonight.
4158112	4158572	Let me guess.
4158592	4159513	Did you go to Digital Life?
4160345	4164707	Yes, I did, and you did say last week you want all the New York callers to call in, so we did.
4164947	4165967	Alright, well, what's on your mind?
4165987	4166708	How was Digital Life?
4167628	4168408	It was fun.
4168708	4174131	Yesterday, I didn't get as much swag, but today I got there early, got plenty of good stuff, mostly t-shirts.
4176432	4177652	Did you get to play PlayStation 3?
4179013	4180633	I didn't even bother.
4181074	4181514	Why not?
4181534	4188016	They had NBA Live up there, and it was like, everybody else was around there, like, drooling over NBA Live.
4188076	4189377	I'm like, it's just a game.
4189764	4192486	I pointed at the $600 brick, laughed and walked away.
4192746	4193406	Played the Wii.
4194247	4195688	You're cutting out a little bit there.
4195728	4198709	You said you didn't play the $600 brick, but you played the Wii?
4199530	4199750	Yes.
4199950	4200731	How was the Wii?
4202252	4204173	It was a little bit new to me.
4204373	4205113	Played Elebit.
4205233	4205834	It was fun.
4206194	4207975	Was Elebit the only game they had there or something?
4209056	4212758	No, they also had Madden for the Wii, but EA shut that down for some odd reason.
4213258	4213518	Oh, okay.
4213979	4215179	So, what did you think of Elebit?
4216480	4217301	It was fun.
4217321	4217861	I mean, it was...
4218365	4219746	I didn't even want to get off the machine.
4219766	4224289	I walked over there, but it was so crowded, so I just watched.
4224309	4227691	I just hung out with Zaku and Sephiroth for a bit.
4227771	4228572	Oh, hell yeah, dude.
4228652	4231974	I'm telling you, get in touch with me Friday night for dinner.
4231994	4235917	I'll email you with the real itinerary a little later.
4247992	4248352	Of course.
4248392	4253014	That's the only thing I'm publicly saying I'm doing is the Saturday noon thing, but I'll tell you a little more about what I'm doing later.
4253275	4254195	That's cool.
4254335	4255936	Alright, anything else you want to share about Digital Life?
4257237	4258377	Man, it was fun.
4258477	4265821	I mean, I remember talking before about how it's going to be the next E3, but it's more of a tech expo than anything else.
4267121	4273164	So you're saying because of the fact it's a little bit too broad in its tech specs that it may not have the power to be the next E3?
4274205	4276826	I don't see it happening anytime soon, literally, I don't.
4277085	4278146	Alright, well, we'll see.
4278386	4278726	We'll see.
4279187	4280828	Especially if there's a Digital Life LA, we'll see.
4281288	4282449	Alright, Ranma, thanks for the call.
4282589	4284871	We'll see you on Saturday.
4284971	4286092	Maybe Friday, if you're lucky.
4286152	4286452	Alright.
4288133	4288393	Later.
4290214	4292196	That was Ranma here, another New York City listener.
4292216	4293677	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4293697	4294077	Who's this?
4294598	4295378	Gravings Dolphin.
4295778	4296279	Hello, buddy.
4296299	4296939	What's on your mind?
4298400	4300902	You made me force me to get a Wii order.
4301062	4301803	Hold on, hold on.
4302363	4303204	Sit tight for a minute there.
4303244	4303464	Hold on.
4304096	4305997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4328209	4330231	No, you've been talking about, you've got to get a Wii.
4330251	4330852	You've got to get a Wii.
4330932	4332133	You've got to get a Wii.
4332253	4333374	When did I say you've got to get a Wii?
4333394	4334015	You've got to get a Wii.
4335296	4336657	But that's what is going through my mind.
4336677	4338018	You're like, Wii, like 200?
4338679	4341822	Well, because I want a Wii really badly.
4343003	4343544	But that's me.
4343924	4347387	You know, as I said earlier, I referenced what I told that email bag thing earlier.
4347427	4349529	You really have to make decisions based on what's best for you.
4349810	4351131	And what's best for me right now?
4354053	4356195	I figured your logic too.
4356395	4357756	I'm going Wii 60 all the way.
4357896	4361620	Alright, so how was your experience pre-ordering?
4361640	4362380	Where did you go?
4362481	4362881	How was it?
4363752	4365073	Actually, it wasn't that bad.
4365953	4368554	The mall I didn't go to was jammed.
4368694	4371115	I mean, God, I'm glad I didn't go there.
4371315	4373656	But the one in Atlantic City was nice.
4373916	4376177	I stood in line for an hour and 40 minutes.
4376557	4379699	It was like this woman, her car broke down.
4380379	4381740	I'm sorry to hear that.
4382180	4384221	But her kid wanted the Wii so bad.
4384281	4386882	It was eight people, and they were all nice.
4388823	4392124	Wait, it was eight people that all came together, or it was eight people in the line?
4392774	4393635	Eight people in line.
4393715	4395476	Oh, that doesn't seem... Whereabouts are you from?
4396657	4397418	Atlantic City.
4397798	4401121	That doesn't seem very long, all things considered, for a town like Atlantic City.
4401341	4402342	Only eight people in the line.
4402842	4403042	Huh.
4403423	4403883	Well, okay.
4404604	4406005	We're a small town.
4406625	4407926	The only thing we do is gamble.
4408226	4408847	I guess that's true.
4408867	4409307	That's true.
4410068	4412270	Yeah, but I bet the Vegas GameStop lines were long.
4413371	4413791	I bet.
4414451	4421237	But, you know, one of the best places to go for cheap electronics is pawn shops in gambling towns.
4422253	4424374	So go to your local pawn shop, find a Wii.
4424634	4425974	That's a good suggestion.
4426354	4429235	Alright, so what did you pre-order with your Wii?
4429275	4431136	Did you just get the Wii or did you get any games?
4432056	4434817	I just got the Wii because I know I have to have it.
4434997	4439158	Orange Lounge Radio episode, I can't remember, for the 19th.
4439818	4442899	Alright, yeah, I don't know what number it is either, but it's going to be an interesting show.
4443199	4445060	Our buddy DMN is actually going to be here in-house.
4445620	4449081	So we're going to have our Nintendo QA guy actually here in-house, so it'll be fun.
4450268	4451529	Yeah, one more.
4452170	4456073	I actually went to a McDonald's for a way port, and it works pretty good.
4457455	4458656	Alright, that's cool.
4459396	4460698	And you got a vision camera.
4460898	4462759	Now we can have a Rob Astey.
4462920	4463240	No.
4464421	4465061	Not happening.
4466142	4467864	Not without proper compensation.
4468945	4470366	Alright, freak, I'm hanging up on you now.
4471487	4471667	Bye.
4472468	4473149	What is up with that?
4473249	4475591	It's so weird.
4477216	4478956	Well, who'd want to see that?
4479196	4481097	Who'd want to see my ass on Xbox Live?
4481117	4481937	That's disgusting.
4482297	4484157	Oh, Rob, you know everyone wants to see your ass.
4484237	4486058	Not until I work it out a little bit, sorry.
4486198	4487478	I think they want to see your wee.
4488418	4489398	Well, they ain't going to get that.
4489558	4490078	One more call.
4490718	4491698	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4491738	4492079	Who's this?
4493059	4493939	It's Dark Teeth.
4494339	4495919	Hey, what's on your mind, Dark Teeth?
4496439	4496959	Dark Teeth?
4497359	4498680	No, Dark Tetsuya.
4498740	4500420	Dark Tea, short for Dark Tetsuya.
4500700	4501140	I'm sorry.
4501200	4502320	Shut up and let the man talk.
4502520	4503761	We have iced tea.
4503941	4506041	He's one of our hardworking staffers.
4506081	4506501	What's on your mind?
4508005	4510706	I had a few FUs.
4511146	4512126	You have FUs?
4513007	4516028	Well... Are they gaming related?
4517248	4517548	Yeah.
4517748	4518688	Okay, then we'll take them.
4518728	4519068	What's up?
4521009	4528051	Well, you heard about Konami's link issue thing on Supernova?
4528291	4532853	Yeah, I guess they officially declared that link mode ain't happening this week.
4532913	4536294	I mean, this week the official press announcement went out or whatever you want to call it.
4536474	4537594	At least DDR Freak ran it.
4538739	4540200	Link Mode is not happening in Supernova.
4540601	4541181	That makes you mad?
4542563	4543163	A little bit.
4543704	4552572	Were you looking forward to making custom dance steps to songs such as... I don't even know what the hell songs are in Supernova.
4552612	4553533	Fascination Max.
4554995	4555795	I had it planned.
4557057	4557797	Any other FUs?
4557917	4558498	Gaming related?
4560245	4564268	Oh, just that my local arcade hasn't got Supernova yet.
4564688	4567990	What is up with lack of Supernova machines in Sacramento?
4568731	4569191	I know.
4569531	4570992	I guess we're just not a real town.
4571272	4572873	We're just some cow town in the middle of nowhere.
4573534	4575495	Well, someday, Dark Tetsuya, someday.
4575955	4579177	Hey, did you do any of the Wii pre-ordering or PlayStation 3?
4579938	4580318	Oh, no.
4580638	4581099	Not yet.
4581199	4582219	Are you going to be getting any of them?
4583820	4585101	Probably get a Wii for Christmas.
4585501	4585762	Okay.
4585802	4588003	Oh, you're hoping Santa will bring you one.
4590164	4591185	Have you been good this year?
4592445	4592745	Oh, yeah.
4592905	4595146	Well, then maybe Santa will bring you one, so that'll be cool.
4595826	4596166	All right.
4596746	4597906	Or he'll give you a spanking.
4598686	4599347	Or some coal.
4600187	4603508	Yeah, if you've been bad, though, you'll get a six-axis, and that's all you get.
4604428	4606588	You just get the paperweight of a six-axis.
4607029	4608609	You guys aren't on the afterbirth, right?
4608979	4610522	No, we're on the actual podcast show.
4610723	4612306	I've never been on the podcast before.
4612487	4613449	Oh, sorry.
4614010	4617097	Extrofer is one of our other personalities on Orange Lounge Radio.
4617137	4618440	He does the Wednesday night show with me.
4618500	4619522	And what else would they know you from?
4619824	4621005	Well, other than that, I really like Supernova.
4649315	4649615	Yeah?
4649655	4651196	Do you like the home release of Supernova?
4652116	4652316	Yep.
4652756	4653997	Top three songs, quick.
4655917	4656477	Oh, God.
4656577	4662239	Centerfold, Battle Without Honor, Humanity, and Gumland a Couple.
4662759	4663260	Of course.
4663380	4664260	Of course you'd say that.
4664920	4666181	Guacamole Del Taco, right?
4667321	4667641	Oh, yeah.
4667781	4668061	All right.
4668161	4669062	All right, Dark Tetsuya.
4669082	4669922	Thanks so much for the call.
4669942	4670662	Have a good one, all right?
4671462	4671822	You too.
4671942	4672223	Later.
4673223	4675604	One of our hardworking staff members there, that Dark Tetsuya.
4675724	4676564	We appreciate him.
4677831	4679972	All right, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight.
4680212	4681693	If you didn't get through, so sorry.
4682213	4683014	Try again next week.
4683074	4684255	Any other last-minute stories?
4684895	4685255	Loki.
4686736	4687176	Of course.
4687696	4693079	We talked earlier about video game movies and there being a movie called 8-Bit the Movie.
4693860	4696241	Well, actually, there is another movie coming out.
4696821	4699543	For your PSP, you can download the entire movie.
4699603	4705286	It's called Killing Time 24-7, and it is available online, actually.
4706021	4708883	for full download to your PSP, which I think is kind of cool.
4708943	4712065	It's kind of like a Hitman movie, basically.
4713106	4724733	The main character who kills people and in his spare time hangs out with his friends and goes to arcades and whatnot and stuff gets a new assignment and his new hit is his father.
4725254	4728096	And so it's kind of based on that.
4728296	4729096	It's actually pretty cool.
4729116	4734880	The download itself is about 300 or just over 300 megs and you can actually find it
4736281	4738162	To download, and I'm pulling up the website.
4738242	4742884	Actually, right now... Thrilling Radio.
4743404	4743804	Sorry.
4744665	4748546	Yeah, but anyways... Let's see.
4748726	4758010	I believe it's KillingTime- Yeah, it's KillingTime-24-7.com If you want to download it.
4758070	4759291	Free download for your PSP.
4760712	4760972	Alright.
4762032	4762432	That's it?
4762793	4763353	That's all I had.
4763413	4763673	Wow!
4764454	4765955	That was good, that was one sentence.
4789008	4791871	Tony Hawk's Project 8 gets some pretty awesome multiplayer on the 360.
4792672	4795214	PlayStation 3 does not have any multiplayer whatsoever.
4795414	4796956	I think that was two sentences, but that's all right.
4797316	4797696	It was good.
4797777	4798337	Semicolon.
4798377	4798657	Was there?
4798737	4801841	Okay.
4802021	4805004	Microsoft launched a new website to browse Xbox Live Marketplace.
4806545	4807786	Ah, I actually saw that.
4808547	4809448	And that was pretty cool.
4810364	4811666	I thought, so you made it two sentences?
4812186	4814168	I was, I was dealt the story.
4814188	4814588	Oh, sorry.
4815028	4815369	Anyways.
4815549	4817951	And the website is Xbox Pipeline or whatever that's called?
4818031	4819252	Xbox Live Pipeline, something like that?
4819272	4820132	Something like that.
4820473	4820753	Anyways.
4821433	4822574	We're so informative.
4824076	4825016	Yeah, there's some website.
4825036	4826017	I couldn't tell you what the name of it is.
4826037	4826998	Well, okay, here, okay.
4827178	4830160	I will tell you the exact website because I am awesome like that.
4830581	4836346	Anyways, the actual website is XboxLivePipeline.com, so go check it out if you haven't already.
4836666	4838167	It has the look and feel of an Xbox.
4838227	4838587	It's kind of nice.
4838627	4839288	It's pretty cool.
4840706	4841426	I have some news.
4842907	4843267	Okay.
4844367	4846367	Loki is officially very funny.
4847148	4850868	Last night we went and ate out at a buffet place.
4851589	4851889	Okay.
4852229	4853809	I'm sorry, this doesn't have to do with games.
4854389	4857270	We killed people on the way because we were racing there.
4857790	4859490	Is that good enough?
4859811	4866212	Anyways, Loki asks the waitress or whoever she was serving us or whatever.
4866552	4870193	He asks her if they're serving any popcorn shrimp.
4870996	4875780	and she goes, and he looks at her and he goes, okay.
4876200	4879422	And everybody's like, did you understand what she just said?
4879882	4881964	And Loki's just very calm.
4882504	4883385	I didn't understand anything.
4883545	4886047	Anyways, it was just so funny.
4886968	4888148	Give it up for Extra Furnace.
4888188	4890210	Farewell performance here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4890330	4890790	All right.
4891691	4897355	One thing I did want to mention, I read this week on the PlayStation 3 online web browser they were talking about,
4898465	4900526	that it has is for text entry.
4901127	4906911	If you don't have a controller or whatever, it has that crappy text entry that they have on the PSP.
4907892	4908913	Isn't that stupid?
4909413	4910634	Just wanted to mention that.
4912496	4914117	Some other fun stuff I was going to say.
4914137	4924245	I remember, well, Japan's getting a brand new Wii Classic controller plus 5,000 point bundle, which is nice because we'll never see that here.
4925924	4929146	And I think that was all I had.
4929326	4937052	Oh, PlayStation 3 Oblivion was supposed to be getting exclusive content for it, but it actually is going to be available for us as well.
4937212	4939814	So, on the Xbox 360 and PC.
4940594	4940814	Oh well.
4943016	4944617	Oh, a new Prey content for online.
4944777	4945718	Multiplayer maps and stuff.
4946098	4947059	I really haven't played much Prey.
4948413	4950094	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4977120	4978581	People who are fans of Eurogamer.
4979101	4991086	They've brought out a new download service for $12.95 a month for the Ultimate Collection, so you can get different games.
4991846	5001049	They actually have, for $6.95, access to the Essential Collection with 90 games to choose from, including Prince of Persia, Hitman, Contract, Splinter Cell, Pandora, Tomorrow.
5001570	5002990	Lots of different stuff coming up on there.
5003010	5003330	Um...
5005512	5033401	but I would recommend going on to their main page and taking a look at it if you want to play Java NES games on your PC at work instead of working you can go to vnes.thatsanderskid.com and they have a whole Java thing for playing Nintendo games alright this is too much news for one night it's time to wrap up the program let's go around and get everybody's final thought Extifer your final thought dare I ask
5034255	5035736	Loki, will you marry me?
5036716	5037757	Loki, your final thought.
5037857	5038077	No.
5039038	5040418	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5046242	5049543	Oh yes, I forgot The Grudge 2 opened up this weekend.
5049744	5050724	Who wants to go see it with me?
5051244	5052645	Not me, that's my final thought.
5054566	5055847	Extrovert will go see it with me, won't you?
5059628	5062670	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5062690	5063851	Oh damn, I wish we were on TV.
5063951	5064631	No, I totally won't.
5064671	5067693	You should see the way he did that, he kind of did this whole little thing.
5067733	5068634	Well, no.
5069954	5072296	It's not you, DarkSakura, it's the movie.
5072996	5073877	You know what, no, I will see it.
5073937	5075598	I just want to see Sarah Michelle Gellar die.
5075898	5076418	I do too.
5076438	5077919	Oh my god, spoilers.
5078439	5081041	No, she doesn't die soon.
5082242	5085484	I saw a really good movie this last weekend though called The Departed.
5085824	5086464	I want to see that.
5086724	5087525	It was so great.
5088271	5089432	Great, great, great.
5089653	5090053	Guess what?
5090373	5090554	What?
5091214	5091435	Rob.
5091995	5092175	What?
5092516	5092696	What?
5093036	5093337	What?
5093477	5093977	What?
5095940	5102427	Okay, see the problem is folks who didn't listen to the three hour show when the grudge came out don't understand why you make that weird ass noise.
5103448	5104709	Why are you making that weird ass noise?
5104749	5107432	I remember the episode when I did that almost the entire thing.
5107553	5109335	Two quick, quick things that came out.
5110134	5115681	One thing that's being reported in our chat, like literally right this second, Bubble Bobble for the DS is broken.
5115741	5117022	Players cannot pass level 30.
5117103	5119545	This has been confirmed by Codemasters.
5119906	5121628	Way to go, Codemasters QA.
5121808	5122769	Loki, your thing real quick.
5123410	5125252	Oh, I was just making fun of this thing.
5125553	5128276	They ran a report on Gizmodo about...
5129318	5130799	Stuff that you can buy that looks stupid.
5131220	5134422	There's a Mame Cabinet costume for Halloween.
5134502	5141387	I just thought it was funny because the joystick, which is abnormally large, is placed right next to where his penis would be.
5141908	5145651	And the coin door, which has two slots right where his balls would be.
5146051	5148773	That's just the college humor in me.
5149253	5149954	That's lovely.
5150683	5155107	And on that note, we're going to call it a night for Orange Lounge Radio this week.
5155587	5158350	Remember, we will not be live on Sunday next week.
5158370	5160952	We're pre-taped because both DarkSakura and I are traveling.
5162173	5163554	Remember, YowieCon.
5164775	5166577	Or New York City, Nintendo World Store.
5166917	5169760	Or Nightmare Before Christmas at the Metreon on Friday night.
5172562	5173783	Hey, I do it a lot better than you do.
5174464	5175785	Can I just unplug that microphone?
5176145	5176645	Yeah, there we go.
5176886	5177566	See, now it's unplugged.
