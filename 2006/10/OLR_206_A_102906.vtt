Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Tonight, October 29th, 2006,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Halo Movie News and Halo 3 tidbits,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Sony and UK Importers go to war,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
and could custom character creation cause trouble for one gaming company?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello everybody out there in the land of internet broadcasting and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
It is episode number 206 for this, October 29th, 2006.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm here to help you through that.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
You might know me as Sky.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
If you're joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-hosts over there in that corner,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I've taken a vow of silence for five seconds.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Great, then I'll introduce Loki.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I give up.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
How are you doing? Seriously though, Jamie?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Head.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
You have a little headache?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Little.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm sorry.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
It was a migraine earlier, but I feel a lot better now.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm very hyper thanks to my coffee.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh goody, we have a hyper Jamie tonight.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
That always makes for a fun show.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
And you forgot.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
What?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
When are we going to set that thing on fire?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Nine.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Hello.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
How you doing?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Good.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
How'd the move go?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
It went good.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm just, you know, without internet until tomorrow.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
That's got to stink.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Not really, because I just play, well actually it's been so busy with unpacking, you know,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
last minute apartment stuff and all that stuff.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Really haven't had a chance to like sit down.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.240
But I have been stealing my neighbor's wireless, but it only seems to work for about five minutes

01:53.240 --> 01:54.240
at a time.

01:54.240 --> 01:59.520
So, you know, I get on there real quickly and read, you know, news and try to check

01:59.520 --> 02:01.080
my email and that doesn't always work.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.400
Have you tried to look at the shared folders on the network to see if there's like porn?

02:04.400 --> 02:09.760
Actually, her network is unsecured, but her shared folders are password protected.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.760
Interesting.

02:10.760 --> 02:14.000
So, they got it halfway right.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.840
Not that we endorse stealing Wi-Fi, but hey, if you're going to leave it open, people might

02:18.840 --> 02:19.840
use it.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.840
All right.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.680
We have a special guest for this tonight, and this is nice because we actually have

02:23.680 --> 02:26.480
someone who I believe has never been on the program before.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.280
So it's nice to have some new blood on the show once in a while.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.280
So say hello everyone to Renee.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.280
Yay.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
Hi.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.280
I'm here.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
How you doing Renee?

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
I'm good.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.680
Don't be afraid to just put that mic right up to your mic because they're not that sensitive

02:37.680 --> 02:38.680
unfortunately.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.680
All right.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
This is better.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.960
Their emotions are sensitive though, so don't make fun of them.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.160
We just want to make sure they can all hear you.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.160
All right.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.160
So you've been a listener of Orange Launch for a little while, right?

02:48.160 --> 02:49.160
Yeah.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.160
Because you've sent us emails before.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Yes, I have.

02:51.160 --> 02:55.280
And I think I joked previously, like on one of the episodes a few weeks ago, that Renee

02:55.280 --> 02:56.280
needs...

02:56.280 --> 02:59.520
Or I said something about like she needs to come to the show or I'm going to take her

02:59.520 --> 03:03.800
on my trip and I'm going to put her in a box and poke holes in it because I've met Renee

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
before.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.760
Renee and I run into each other at weird places like E3 and the...

03:08.760 --> 03:09.920
Your friend's concert at Final Fantasy.

03:09.920 --> 03:10.920
I remember that.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.880
We ran into each other at the very first-year friend's concert in L.A.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.600
But you were here and you brought your box with you, I saw.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.600
Yes, I brought my box.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.600
It has holes.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.780
Now, kids on the internet who are going to read into that statement, just freaking clean

03:25.780 --> 03:26.780
up right now.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.200
I'm going to come over there and wash out your brain with soap.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.200
All right.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
Anyway.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
But how are you doing?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.200
Good.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
Good.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.640
So what kind of a gamer are you?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.160
What kind of games do you like to play?

03:37.160 --> 03:39.200
What kind of stuff do you like?

03:39.200 --> 03:46.440
At heart, I am a console gamer, so I've been playing a couple of PC games recently.

03:46.440 --> 03:54.040
Actually, last week, I tapped into my tabletop gaming and I was playing some Hero Quest,

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
so...

03:55.040 --> 03:56.040
Wow.

03:56.040 --> 04:02.000
So I guess I like RPGs, rhythm and simulation-type games, puzzles, so...

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
All right.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Very cool.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.440
The typical gamer girl.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.040
Well, welcome to the program.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.040
Thank you.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
Now, something occurred to me this morning.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.600
You actually, at one point, worked in the industry a little bit, didn't you?

04:13.600 --> 04:14.600
I still do, actually.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
You do?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.600
Yes, I do.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.600
Really?

04:17.600 --> 04:18.600
You used to work at Konami a couple of years ago.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.600
I did.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.600
I used to work at Konami.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.600
That's where I actually started off.

04:21.600 --> 04:26.880
I have been in the DDR community for a while, and that's when I started listening to Orange

04:26.880 --> 04:31.200
Lounge Radio, because that's where all the cool kids went to, they listened to Orange

04:31.200 --> 04:32.200
Lounge.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
Love the endorsement.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
Love it.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.200
Thank you.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.720
I met Mike Noh, also known as Asian Innovation.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.080
Best rapper ever.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.960
Not if you have to deal with him rapping at work, I'll tell you that.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.680
No, but his drunken rap's pretty funny.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.260
Oh my God, it is pretty funny.

04:51.260 --> 04:57.120
And so I met him, and he said, you know, do you like video games?

04:57.120 --> 04:58.120
I'm like, yeah.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.600
And he's like, would you like to be a video game tester at Konami?

05:00.600 --> 05:02.320
And I said, sure.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.920
And so that's where I started off at Konami.

05:04.920 --> 05:10.760
I started doing step data, and then I moved into functionality QA testing.

05:10.760 --> 05:16.600
And then I left QA to go pursue other career.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
It happens.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.600
It happens.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
You move on.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
Yeah.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.120
And then actually I went back into the video game industry to go to LucasArts, and I was

05:24.120 --> 05:25.520
a QA tester there.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.280
I did compliance testing, so that's like standards, first party standards.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.800
So you know, testing to make sure that if we are developing a game for Microsoft or

05:33.800 --> 05:39.000
Sony that they have the right terminology, or it doesn't fail.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.440
That's what I've heard from some people in the industry, is that those companies are

05:41.440 --> 05:49.200
very strict on, you know, you have to call this button like the Xbox 360 guide button.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.240
And you can't say, oh, that center silver glowing button, or the silver button on the

05:53.240 --> 05:55.320
controller, it has to be the guide button.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.320
Exactly.

05:56.320 --> 06:03.600
And you know, Microsoft and especially Sony, they're very stringent that you have to use

06:03.600 --> 06:10.080
like their controller layout, like if you're going to show it on screen or in the manual,

06:10.080 --> 06:14.520
it has to look exactly like it, or else, you know, they'll be very angry at you.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.160
Bad things happen, yeah.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.160
That's interesting.

06:17.160 --> 06:21.240
So there's a lot more that goes into putting a game like on the multi-platform than you

06:21.240 --> 06:22.240
might think at first.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.240
Definitely.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.240
Oh, definitely.

06:24.240 --> 06:29.440
I've seen games fail submission from, you know, going into production just because of

06:29.440 --> 06:36.440
the fact that, you know, the message that comes up when you unplug your controller wasn't

06:36.440 --> 06:37.440
correct.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.440
Wow.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.440
Yeah.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.440
That's a lot of money, too.

06:40.440 --> 06:47.000
It's like at least a couple thousand each time you submit to Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Wow.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yes.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Interesting.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Well, thanks for the insight.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
That's pretty awesome.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
No problem.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.480
And right now, I'm working at Perpetual Entertainment.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.280
They haven't come up with any games yet, but the two games that they do have in development

07:01.280 --> 07:05.000
is Gods and Heroes, Roam Rising, and Star Trek Online.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Star Trek.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Star Trek Online?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yes.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Star Trek Online.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Awesome.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Oh, that's something I might get into.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I'm the resident Trekkie.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm a closet Trekkie, a little bit.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Shh.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Don't tell anyone.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Okay.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
But I like Trek.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
So you're in the closet for some things, but out of the closet for us.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yes.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Appreciate that.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm still kidnapping you to go see Warp 11.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
All right.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, cool.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
That's very cool.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
So this is very neat.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.440
And of course, our chat room is very excited to see another gamer girl on the show over

07:34.440 --> 07:36.160
at Orangelaunchradio.com.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.160
Click on Chat.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.120
We have some folks in the chat room there.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.480
Fireboma is reminding us that free advertisement doesn't work on your own station.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.000
So these plugs for Orange Launch Radio don't really do anything here.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Let's see.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
What else here?

07:48.000 --> 07:53.200
DMN says that DNL is his hero, because your name in the online world is DNL.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
Yes, it is.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.660
So DNL is DMN's hero.

07:55.660 --> 07:56.660
That's a lot of initials.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.160
We have alphabet soup going on here.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.160
All right.

07:59.160 --> 08:03.100
Well, let's get into what we do at the top of every show and talk about our gaming week.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.760
So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

08:04.760 --> 08:05.760
I played stuff, actually.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.760
Really?

08:06.760 --> 08:07.760
What did you play?

08:07.760 --> 08:10.720
Well, we had a barbecue at my place last night that somebody who was invited didn't show

08:10.720 --> 08:11.720
up for.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.720
Sorry, other things, you know.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.720
That's okay.

08:13.720 --> 08:14.720
Busy boy.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.720
I have to tease.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.480
But we broke out the 360 and played.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.520
Okay, we had to see how awful the Sonic demo was.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.440
Dan's actually pretty damn good at controlling that, but it's still awful.

08:25.440 --> 08:29.960
And it was funny, our friend Alex was over, and Alex is an ex-Marine.

08:29.960 --> 08:35.400
He takes it very seriously, and he was just, he could have been a drill sergeant.

08:35.400 --> 08:40.040
His voice is like, this is making my head explode!

08:40.040 --> 08:41.920
So that was pretty funny.

08:41.920 --> 08:46.040
And then they put up the fear demo, but it was actually cool, because Alex had been playing

08:46.040 --> 08:51.880
it on PC and was going through the differences between the PC and the Xbox 360 in his opinion.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.600
He said it was actually pretty damn close.

08:55.600 --> 09:00.280
And I have to say that I'm probably going to play fear if I don't get motion sick from

09:00.280 --> 09:01.280
it.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.680
The demo did not make me that motion sick, because first-person shooters always do that

09:04.680 --> 09:06.120
to me.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.840
I love, though, the very freaky element of, Dan's like, okay, watch this, this is about

09:09.840 --> 09:11.400
to get all Silent Hill.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
Look!

09:12.400 --> 09:14.680
I was like, ooh, blood.

09:14.680 --> 09:20.400
I actually, I did hang out with Jamie this week outside the show, which was fun.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.000
And I got to see the walkthrough of the fear demo as well, and it looked pretty neat.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.780
I don't usually get into first-person shooters, but I like the whole freaky element that fear

09:27.780 --> 09:28.780
has going on.

09:28.780 --> 09:32.560
And I kind of miss it on the PC, you know, I just, I don't do a whole lot of gaming on

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
the PC.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.560
I apologize to our PC gamer fans.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.240
There's a couple once in a while that'll make me look, but fear's maybe something I'll look

09:39.240 --> 09:41.200
at on the console, for sure.

09:41.200 --> 09:47.260
Well, apart from that, I actually played my first game, well actually I had Dan play it

09:47.260 --> 09:50.600
for me, because I was sort of, my eyes hurt.

09:50.600 --> 09:56.940
So he played Uno on my gamertag, and my first game was one with a draw four.

09:56.940 --> 09:57.940
So I was like, hey!

09:57.940 --> 10:02.520
And then we saw somebody picking their nose on the webcam.

10:02.520 --> 10:07.480
That's pretty tame compared to a lot of things I've heard that people are seeing on Uno webcams.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.880
Nothing is as fun as Dan shit-talking, though.

10:09.880 --> 10:10.880
That's just really funny.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.880
But he doesn't do it in the microphone.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.880
No.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.140
But it was really funny to just hear him, you know, sit there and shit-talk all these

10:15.140 --> 10:17.600
people, they can't hear them, but it's really funny.

10:17.600 --> 10:24.320
But I also, I bought PSU yesterday, and got around to playing a little bit today.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.680
Phantasy Star Universe, for those not in the know.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.680
Yeah.

10:28.680 --> 10:33.220
I couldn't, for some reason I couldn't get online, it said that my thing was interrupted

10:33.220 --> 10:34.600
or something by the server.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.880
I was like...

10:35.880 --> 10:36.880
Oh!

10:36.880 --> 10:37.880
Try backing out and going back in.

10:37.880 --> 10:38.880
I did.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.880
Didn't work.

10:39.880 --> 10:40.880
Really?

10:40.880 --> 10:41.880
There might have weird server things.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.000
Well, at any rate, if that doesn't work, I'm just gonna change out the credit card

10:44.000 --> 10:49.760
I used, because I used my ATM card, but my bank has weird authorization things.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.640
So I'm going to try it again later, but I did play a little bit in story mode, and it's

10:54.640 --> 10:58.040
like uber-automé, cliche the game.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.040
It's not bad.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.040
It's pretty.

11:00.040 --> 11:04.560
I'm like, okay, but the voice acting sort of irritates me, and hearing the main song

11:04.560 --> 11:06.760
in English irritates me as well.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.060
I was like, whoever they got to sing just can't.

11:10.060 --> 11:15.600
I have a very bad problem with professional singers who are tone deaf, because that's

11:15.600 --> 11:17.820
what this lady sounded like.

11:17.820 --> 11:21.960
And so that was really it for my gaming week.

11:21.960 --> 11:26.280
I did try to play a little bit of Pirate King, but I had some computer issues, and I think

11:26.280 --> 11:27.840
I'm just not going to play that anymore.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.480
It got kind of boring really fast.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.940
Oh, that's too bad.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.600
It's a cute game, just boring.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.400
Alex in our chatroom offers some advice, says, yeah, Jamie, it's been doing that to everyone.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.680
You'll have to keep trying until it works, in regards to Phantasy Star Universe.

11:41.680 --> 11:45.120
It did that to me once, but then when I went back in, it worked, so I don't know.

11:45.120 --> 11:53.520
Well, I'm thinking that I'm going to try to recreate my ranger chick that kicked ass.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.520
All right.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.520
Well, good luck to you.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.480
Hopefully I can, but I'm still pissed off, though, about not being able to make a really

11:59.480 --> 12:01.480
girly man.

12:01.480 --> 12:05.040
We'll have to party up together sometime, but it'll have to wait a couple weeks, because

12:05.040 --> 12:08.720
12's out this week, and that's going to be my life for a couple weeks.

12:08.720 --> 12:17.640
I also, though, would like to give a public shout out to the GameStop on Sunrise, because

12:17.640 --> 12:24.320
you guys had some of the best customer service, despite the fact that you know my husband.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.200
You guys are really, really great, and I have to give a shout out.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.860
Now, one thing we should point out, because obviously most of our listeners don't live

12:29.860 --> 12:33.080
in the Sacramento area, but the GameStop on Sunrise is funny, because right across the

12:33.080 --> 12:34.960
street is a mall with a GameStop in it.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.680
So these two are within walking distance of each other.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.680
It's kind of crazy.

12:38.680 --> 12:43.040
They were a very busy store, but for as busy as they were, I was noticing that they were

12:43.040 --> 12:48.360
trying to give everybody attention, and that, to me, was just really kind of refreshing

12:48.360 --> 12:49.720
to see at a GameStop.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.120
That's good advice for any employees that we might have that listen to this show, because

12:53.120 --> 12:57.240
I know we do have some employees of certain games, not just GameStop, but GameCrazy, all

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
the other ones, too, listen to this.

12:58.240 --> 13:02.560
My hubby is no longer associated with GameStop, but that still doesn't mean I hate him.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.560
All right.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.080
Let's go over to Loki.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.080
How was your gaming week?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.080
I didn't play too much.

13:07.080 --> 13:12.200
I played Saints Row, finished the Vice King storyline, so now I'm a quarter of the way

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
through the game.

13:13.200 --> 13:18.440
I started the West Side Rollers storyline, and I don't know.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.440
It's still fun.

13:19.440 --> 13:24.400
I still play it every lunch, usually causing some sort of mayhem and trying to find new

13:24.400 --> 13:32.320
ways to die or explode or just glitches in the game, and yeah, it's really entertaining.

13:32.320 --> 13:38.320
I played the Tony Hawk's Project 8 demo, and I don't care for it one bit.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.880
It's a great game, I'm sure.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.320
It's just too technical now.

13:41.320 --> 13:47.280
If you aren't really into Tony Hawk and you're picking this up the first time to go into

13:47.280 --> 13:50.320
it, you're going to have trouble doing a lot of stuff.

13:50.320 --> 13:55.560
I felt an awful lot, whereas Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it was fucking easy.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.860
It was fun to be able to pull off crazy stuff, and it wasn't too hard.

13:59.860 --> 14:04.280
Now they're just giving you way too much damn control over stuff, and I think that'd be

14:04.280 --> 14:07.600
good if you know what you're doing, but if you don't know what you're doing, that's not

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
really good.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.600
I don't know.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.600
It's pretty, though.

14:10.600 --> 14:15.600
What was the other demo I was going to try?

14:15.600 --> 14:23.120
I meant to try Rainbow Six, but we were supposed to be playing in our theater at work, but

14:23.120 --> 14:27.960
we didn't get a chance to do that, so I didn't play it.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.920
Or Need for Speed Most Wanted, actually, because I'm trying to finish up the game before Carbon

14:31.920 --> 14:40.720
comes out, and I'm about halfway through that now, so that's good.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.040
Waiting for Vice City Stories, it's coming out on Tuesday, so we'll be able to switch

14:44.040 --> 14:48.440
out the game pretty soon, so I'll have a full review of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

14:48.440 --> 14:49.440
next week.

14:49.440 --> 14:56.480
In the meantime, though, we are finishing up Liberty City Stories, and I am still kicking

14:56.480 --> 15:05.400
major ass in our killing spree at work, and so far I'm ahead by, I think, 30 kills, which

15:05.400 --> 15:06.400
is awesome.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
All right.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.400
Anything else?

15:08.400 --> 15:09.400
No.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.400
All right.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.880
Then I can talk about my gaming week.

15:13.880 --> 15:18.260
First off, it's been a little while since we've done a show, because we pre-taped last

15:18.260 --> 15:20.680
week on Wednesday, because we did all that traveling.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.400
How was YowieCon, by the way?

15:22.400 --> 15:23.400
Dark Sakura.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
I forgot another game I played.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
Oh, what's that?

15:25.400 --> 15:28.720
I downloaded Luminous for mobile, and it's actually pretty fun.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
Yeah?

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
For a mobile game?

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
I've been playing Shinin.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.720
I usually don't, really, Shinin's on the mobile version.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.360
Here, I'll tell you what, I'll play it up in a second, because I can get it to play

15:35.360 --> 15:36.360
through the mic.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.360
All right.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.360
Do it after.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.360
But YowieCon was fun.

15:39.360 --> 15:45.240
I forgot to mention, I played Luminous live, and eh, eh, eh.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.240
It's not the same as PSP.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.920
I don't think it's worth spending the $15.

15:49.920 --> 15:50.920
I just don't know.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.920
For half the game?

15:51.920 --> 15:52.920
Yeah.

15:52.920 --> 15:53.920
For half the PSP version?

15:53.920 --> 15:54.920
Yeah.

15:54.920 --> 15:55.920
I don't know.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.280
It's okay, I guess, but I have problems with some of the graphics in there.

16:00.280 --> 16:05.080
Some of the tilesets that they have are hard to see, and it really hurts my eyes to try

16:05.080 --> 16:07.280
to concentrate on it.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.480
If they had an option to keep a specific tileset and just change the music or something, that

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
would be great.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.840
Well, you can do that in a different mode, but then you don't unlock new skins, because

16:15.840 --> 16:17.880
you can do a skin rotate.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.520
You can set the order of the skins as they show up, but then if you don't play through

16:21.520 --> 16:24.740
the regular mode, you can't unlock skins to use in that mode, so it's kind of a double

16:24.740 --> 16:25.740
edged sword.

16:25.740 --> 16:29.600
And then there's the achievement in order to use that mode or whatever, you have to

16:29.600 --> 16:34.480
unlock a ton of different skins, but the problem is you have to score 500,000 points, and the

16:34.480 --> 16:39.500
only way you're able to do that with one play through is you have to buy the other packs.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.120
So in order to get certain achievements, you have to buy the other packs.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.680
Thank you very much Cute Entertainment.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.280
My Gaming Week, I played Phantasy Star Universe.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.980
Now I can finally talk about it, because I've played the commercial release, and so I feel

16:52.980 --> 16:55.920
a little better giving a full review of this game.

16:55.920 --> 17:01.480
I like Phantasy Star Universe a lot because it's different from other MMOs because it's

17:01.480 --> 17:04.640
a little more action oriented from what you're used to.

17:04.640 --> 17:10.280
Final Fantasy World of Warcraft have action elements, but in the end I feel that Phantasy

17:10.280 --> 17:15.200
Star Universe is a lot more action oriented than the others.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.080
It kind of feels like a 3D Diablo, that's kind of what Phantasy Star Online was.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.200
Phantasy Star Universe takes a lot of what was started in Phantasy Star Online and just

17:23.200 --> 17:28.680
improves on it, so it's really a good sequel, solid sequel to Phantasy Star Online.

17:28.680 --> 17:32.960
I do love the fact that they put in a single player mode, and it's actually surprisingly

17:32.960 --> 17:33.960
decent.

17:33.960 --> 17:38.120
I thought it was going to be kind of a write off crappy thing, but the story is not half

17:38.120 --> 17:39.120
bad.

17:39.120 --> 17:43.880
I love the way how they have it set up like a cheesy anime type thing, but I agree with

17:43.880 --> 17:48.160
Jamie that whoever is singing that opening song is pretty bad, but a lot of animes have

17:48.160 --> 17:52.360
cheesy openings, but literally you play the game in chapters, and every chapter starts

17:52.360 --> 17:55.600
off with the same cheesy anime-ish opening.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.000
It's not actual anime, but they use the in-game engine and do it, but you'll see what I mean.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.920
It's set up just like an anime.

18:00.920 --> 18:05.680
But the funny thing is when you beat a chapter, then it goes like, next time on Phantasy Star

18:05.680 --> 18:06.680
Universe.

18:06.680 --> 18:10.160
It's really funny, so I love the way it's set up, and I don't think the story is that

18:10.160 --> 18:11.160
bad.

18:11.160 --> 18:14.080
The only thing I don't like is that there's odd loading in cut scenes.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.880
They don't load the cut scene all at once.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.720
They'll load half, and then there's a cut scene, and then they do another.

18:18.720 --> 18:24.400
It's kind of weird, so it's got some weird loading issues, but you kind of get over that.

18:24.400 --> 18:30.520
The other thing I think that doesn't settle well with me in Phantasy Star Universe is

18:30.520 --> 18:35.840
that it seems like the gameplay might seem to get a little repetitive towards the end,

18:35.840 --> 18:41.240
but they've added a lot of different types of weapons and certain types of spells that

18:41.240 --> 18:42.240
you can use.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.840
I don't know if this game is necessarily going to be for everyone, but if you check

18:45.840 --> 18:49.360
out the beta and you liked it, I'd say give the commercial release a try.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.280
You don't have to put up with the online stuff if you don't want to because the single player

18:52.280 --> 18:53.400
mode is pretty decent.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.880
It's a decent game.

18:54.880 --> 19:01.080
I don't know if it's $60, but there's the PlayStation 2 and PC ones available I think

19:01.080 --> 19:02.200
a little bit cheaper.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.360
But I'm going to play this for a little while, but I don't know if I'd play this more than

19:05.360 --> 19:06.360
like three months.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.740
I think the magic will be gone in a few months, but we'll see.

19:08.740 --> 19:11.800
It's all up to Sega, and are they going to keep it new and keep it fresh and keep it

19:11.800 --> 19:12.800
updated?

19:12.800 --> 19:17.640
Right now I worry a little bit because they are having some server problems, but I suppose

19:17.640 --> 19:18.640
it's early on.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.640
They just launched a big game.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.800
There's going to be a few issues, but hopefully those will fix themselves because I know they

19:23.800 --> 19:29.160
had a lot of game maintenance problems with Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox, and I'd

19:29.160 --> 19:31.880
really hate to see the same thing happen with the universe.

19:31.880 --> 19:37.160
So fan community, speak up when things are going wrong, and hopefully Sega will be listening.

19:37.160 --> 19:43.760
I do recommend Phantasy Star Universe to fans of role-playing type games, and I would say

19:43.760 --> 19:47.400
the closest thing I could really compare it to that's not online would be something like,

19:47.400 --> 19:52.080
I don't know, it feels a little bit like Zelda to me, a little bit, but maybe with less puzzle

19:52.080 --> 19:53.080
element.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.120
I will say though that some of the scenery in Phantasy Star Universe is gorgeous.

19:56.120 --> 20:00.320
There's a planet that has a very old Asia type theme to it.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.200
It's really gorgeous, some of the areas there.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.920
So it's really a step up graphically from PSO, which got kind of old with the graphics

20:06.920 --> 20:10.360
after playing it a little while.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.880
Let's see, the other game I want to talk about really quickly is Clubhouse Games for the

20:13.880 --> 20:17.040
DS because I picked it up, but I haven't really talked about it on the show.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
It's pretty cool.

20:18.040 --> 20:22.840
There's a lot, a lot of games on it, and I think that value alone makes it worth a purchase

20:22.840 --> 20:24.440
if you're into the casual games.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.640
If you're not into casual games, you want something with more depth, I don't think there's

20:28.640 --> 20:30.040
going to be a whole lot here for you.

20:30.040 --> 20:34.560
They try to make it a little longer gameplay and kind of streamline it all together with

20:34.560 --> 20:39.520
things like mission mode and stamp mode, but overall it's nothing more than just an excuse

20:39.520 --> 20:41.200
to make you try every single game.

20:41.200 --> 20:46.440
I was a little disappointed that online doesn't have certain games in it, so be careful before

20:46.440 --> 20:47.440
you pick up the game.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.920
Check out, do some research online and see if the games you want to play online are even

20:50.920 --> 20:56.560
playable because they aren't all playable online, so be careful.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.200
If you want, I have that music queued up so people can hear what it sounds like.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.560
If it'll come through, hopefully.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.560
It should.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.560
I'm starting the level over.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.680
Oh, it's like a cheesy mini version of it, I can hear it.

21:06.680 --> 21:11.680
Yeah, it's like a cheesy mini version of it.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.000
I guess for a phone it's not bad.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.640
It'll pick up in a second.

21:16.640 --> 21:25.360
Now, see, this makes me kind of go, why isn't this on the Xbox Live one?

21:25.360 --> 21:28.120
This is like the best song in the game, and they got it on the frickin' cell phone, but

21:28.120 --> 21:30.000
they didn't get it on Xbox Live?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
That's weird.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Oh, well.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Anyway, thank you, Jamie.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.440
I think it turned out pretty nicely.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.280
Yeah, for a cell phone game, that's not bad.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.280
You know I hate cell phone games, usually.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.280
Anyway.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.680
Renee, how was your gaming week?

21:41.680 --> 21:43.880
What kind of games have you been playing?

21:43.880 --> 21:50.840
Besides the HeroQuest, I have been playing Clubhouse games as well.

21:50.840 --> 21:56.000
I don't really have Wi-Fi set up at my house, and so I've been stealing Wi-Fi from the Metreon

21:56.000 --> 21:58.800
because I live in San Francisco.

21:58.800 --> 22:05.200
The only game that I've actually been able to play online is Darts, and it's fine.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.680
But I do understand that if there are some games that you do like and you want to check,

22:09.680 --> 22:14.320
you definitely want to check out and see if you can play it online, because I really was

22:14.320 --> 22:18.560
looking forward to playing Split, or Spit, or Speed.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.800
That was the one I wanted to do, too.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.080
And yeah, because I totally kill on that, so I'm awesome.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.080
We should play it together.

22:25.080 --> 22:28.640
See, we should have totally battled, but we can't, because we can't play it on the internet.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.040
Don't cry.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.520
I've also played LocoRoco.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.760
I really love that game.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.440
I've beat it like two times now, and it's really cute.

22:38.440 --> 22:47.160
Basically it's made by SCEI, or Sony Computer Detainment International, which is Sony.

22:47.160 --> 22:52.560
Basically you play as a world, and there's these little LocoRocos that are these little

22:52.560 --> 23:02.640
yellow blobs, and you help them roll around and get rid of the mojos that are trying to

23:02.640 --> 23:05.880
invade the world, and that's basically it.

23:05.880 --> 23:12.080
I guess the closest you can compare it to would be Katamari Damacy, but it's not really.

23:12.080 --> 23:16.680
It's kind of hard when you have these very original games to try and compare it to something

23:16.680 --> 23:17.680
else.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.680
Definitely.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.480
Probably people were going, like, Fantasy Star Universe is like Zelda.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.480
What the hell is he saying?

23:21.480 --> 23:22.480
I don't know.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.480
Is it a sword-slashing thing?

23:23.480 --> 23:24.480
I don't know.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.480
I don't know.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.560
It's the best thing I can name.

23:27.560 --> 23:32.280
The reason why I actually started playing LocoRoco again, because I basically beat it

23:32.280 --> 23:38.560
about a month ago, was because I had gone to visit the Sony store at the Metreon, or

23:38.560 --> 23:44.040
PlayStation store, and they had this little booth set up, and they had these little inflatable

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
LocoRocos.

23:45.040 --> 23:52.920
There was two one-foot LocoRoco inflatables, and then this one huge three-foot one.

23:52.920 --> 23:58.440
I walked up to one of the workers there, and I said, oh, are you guys selling these?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.960
He's like, no, actually, sorry.

24:00.960 --> 24:05.520
I made a little pouty face, because that's what I do.

24:05.520 --> 24:08.680
I asked him, well, can I at least look at it?

24:08.680 --> 24:14.640
He went behind the booth, and he took the smaller one, and he handed that to me.

24:14.640 --> 24:20.080
As soon as I had it in my grasp, I held onto it, and I gave it a quick little hug, and

24:20.080 --> 24:26.440
I said, oh, it's so cute, like the girl I am.

24:26.440 --> 24:30.440
Of course, his heart melted, and he's like, oh, do you want it?

24:30.440 --> 24:31.440
I'm like, of course.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.200
He's like, well, you can have it for free.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
Here it is with her today.

24:35.200 --> 24:40.200
It's here with me today, and before he could say, I'm just kidding, I squeed, and I just

24:40.200 --> 24:41.200
ran out.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.200
I'm very happy.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.560
He ran away before he could take it back.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.520
That's why I started playing Loco Roco again.

24:49.520 --> 24:54.920
Another game that I've been playing, actually, right now, I just picked up Cooking Mama.

24:54.920 --> 25:00.880
In the Bay Area, I've visited at least five different EB's, and I've asked every single

25:00.880 --> 25:05.040
time, every time I've gone, and this is multiple occasions, I ask, do you guys have Cooking

25:05.040 --> 25:06.040
Mama?

25:06.040 --> 25:15.680
As I've come to expect it, their answer is no, and like the little fangirl of Nintendo

25:15.680 --> 25:20.060
DS games I am, I pout and walk away.

25:20.060 --> 25:25.600
But today, when I came to visit Sacramento, I went to the EB games over in Ardenwood,

25:25.600 --> 25:31.280
and they had Cooking Mama, and right now, Mama is telling me to poke my steak.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.280
Wow, okay.

25:34.280 --> 25:40.920
What kind of game is this?

25:40.920 --> 25:47.400
This is some sick, twisted little game under the cutesy farce of a Cooking Mama title.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.600
Hey, well, you know, whatever Mama wants, she gets.

25:50.600 --> 25:56.920
Next year, we're going to have Cooking Emerald, where he yells out things while you're trying

25:56.920 --> 25:57.920
to cook.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.920
Bam!

25:58.920 --> 25:59.920
Yeah.

25:59.920 --> 26:03.800
Mama wants you to come over here and poke my steak.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
This is dirty.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.800
Dirty, dirty.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
I'm sorry.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.800
I think I need to get that game.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
Wow.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.840
Maybe there's some girly thing, I don't get, oh well, forget it, I don't know.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.960
All right, well that's cool, well great, and I'm glad you brought, can I give your Loco

26:16.960 --> 26:17.960
Rocodoll a hug?

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
Yes, you can, you can.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.960
Yay!

26:19.960 --> 26:21.560
Here I go.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.640
This is great radio, by the way.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.880
If only you could see Rob now, he has the biggest grin ever.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.600
I know, it's cute, it's very cute.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.300
I would have tried to steal one too, but you know, I would have had to find a worker there

26:32.300 --> 26:35.800
that bats for my team, and I don't know if there are any there, so, well it is San Francisco

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
for God's sake.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.800
Yes.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.440
The official Sony store is still there at the Metreon, even though Sony sold it, right?

26:40.440 --> 26:41.440
It is.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.440
The Metreon itself.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.440
Exactly.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.440
I was at the Metreon last week.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.200
That's right, and how was your experience at the Metreon?

26:46.200 --> 26:50.960
I saw Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D, and I had only had three hours of sleep and it

26:50.960 --> 26:54.880
had been going all day, so I actually fell asleep during the parts where they're handing

26:54.880 --> 26:55.880
out all the presents.

26:55.880 --> 26:59.920
But right at the beginning, it's me, Chris, Megzi, and Mecco, who is our friend from Canada.

26:59.920 --> 27:04.000
We're all trying to grab the snowflakes at the beginning of the movie, and then me and

27:04.000 --> 27:08.800
Megzi are like, ooh, Jack.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.000
But the thing about it is that they've touched up the quality or something on it because

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
you can actually see the fibers move in the different clothes that are actually, like

27:17.000 --> 27:21.560
in Sally's dress for instance, you can see the different fiber layouts different for

27:21.560 --> 27:25.920
when they've used different doll models, you know, when they've had her up there for the

27:25.920 --> 27:27.880
different positions and everything.

27:27.880 --> 27:33.600
So if you go, and I think it's actually playing through, I think through December, if you

27:33.600 --> 27:39.000
go onto, actually just do a search for it, a website will pop up for Disney, and you

27:39.000 --> 27:42.320
can actually order your tickets through Fandango, which I highly recommend because it's going

27:42.320 --> 27:44.200
to be sold out the whole time.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.200
Especially this season, yeah.

27:45.200 --> 27:50.720
Yeah, if you can see it anywhere, go see it because it's seriously, it is worth the view.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.720
Awesome.

27:51.720 --> 27:52.720
All right.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.520
And sitting in line was kind of fun, but not really.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.920
Now while you were doing that, I was in New York City and I actually met up with some

27:57.920 --> 27:58.920
of our listeners.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.480
So some folks came out to see me at Nintendo World, I thought there was going to be like

28:02.480 --> 28:06.160
two people, but it turned out to be about seven, so it was cool, I was glad to see some

28:06.160 --> 28:08.080
folks show up at Nintendo World to say hi.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.160
So thank you very much to the New York City folks who came out and said hi, and we went

28:11.160 --> 28:13.400
to lunch together in Times Square, it was very cool.

28:13.400 --> 28:18.160
And hold on one minute, I'll be right back because they gave us some stuff from Digital

28:18.160 --> 28:19.740
Life, so I'll be right back.

28:19.740 --> 28:25.520
Next radio ever, where Rob runs out of the room, giddy like a little schoolgirl.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
That's adorable.

28:26.520 --> 28:34.440
In the meantime, the ferret will serenade everybody, and oh, Rob's back.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.840
You could have stayed gone, this could have been a ferret show.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.520
So I have shirts, so I don't know who wants what, but the white one seems a little more

28:40.520 --> 28:42.080
girly, so I'm going to give the white one to Jamie.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.080
I wear black though.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.080
Oh, you want the black one?

28:44.080 --> 28:45.080
What's the black one say?

28:45.080 --> 28:49.340
The black one says, let's see, it's- If it's white, I won't wear it.

28:49.340 --> 28:50.340
The quad father.

28:50.340 --> 28:51.340
Okay, I'll take the white one.

28:51.340 --> 28:52.340
Okay.

28:52.340 --> 28:57.000
Then I'll give the black one to Loki, because he's kind of dark too, so he's dark and gothic

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
and tragic and all that stuff.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Hey, I'm the resident goth.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Oh, this is cool.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.480
And I have- Unplug and connect.

29:02.480 --> 29:06.000
I have some mouse pads as well, so I'm going to give one to Renee as well, so there you

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
go.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Thank you.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
And then you guys get mouse pads too.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
That's what I wanted.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Oh.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
The listeners.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Verizon wireless mouse pad.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
That's funny, because I use singular.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
But I thought that was very nice.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
You do?

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
I thought that was very nice that our listeners kept us in mind there, so thank you.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Of course, thank you.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.560
And I'm also going to give Renee, because we have a whole stock of these CDs, some CDs

29:24.560 --> 29:25.560
from a different drum.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.760
Ooh, I love a different drum.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
I know, aren't they the best?

29:27.760 --> 29:28.760
I know.

29:28.760 --> 29:32.240
And we have some CDs here, and we've been giving these away just kind of sporadically.

29:32.240 --> 29:36.680
We have a CD single for Come With Me from DDR Ultramix 3, a rain dancer, and a song that's

29:36.680 --> 29:41.560
going to be in Ultramix 4, Rupesh Cartel, Yours to Command, is a B-side on this CD,

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
so enjoy.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.560
Ooh, amazing.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.560
Thank you.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.560
I will.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.560
No problemo.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.560
Have fun with that.

29:47.560 --> 29:52.000
Thank you so much for keeping, and to start us off, we are going to reenact the voicemails

29:52.000 --> 29:56.680
of the week this week, and we have a very special message from our webmaster.

29:56.680 --> 29:57.680
Let's take a listen.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.680
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

29:59.680 --> 30:04.200
This is Jason, and I have a very special and happy announcement from all of us.

30:04.200 --> 30:10.560
Starting as of right now, you have a toll-free number that any of you are willing to use.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.880
That number, first off, is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

30:14.880 --> 30:19.520
That is 1-877-4263657.

30:19.520 --> 30:23.320
This is unfortunately only going to the United States and Canada, but the rest of you still

30:23.320 --> 30:26.600
have Skype, and will work at any time.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
Free for you.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
Have fun.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
All right.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Awesome.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
So now we're almost like legitimate radio here.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.840
We have our own 800 number, or 877 number, but same thing.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.780
So we have a new toll-free number for you guys to use, and you can use that in interacting

30:38.780 --> 30:41.800
with our station when we take calls a little later in the program.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.660
That number, once again, 877-GAME-OLR.

30:45.660 --> 30:50.200
That's 877-4263657.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.300
Because of the fact that we have the toll-free number now, we're thinking this might encourage

30:53.300 --> 30:57.280
folks to leave us voicemails, so we are going to open up that segment we did a while back.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.280
We're going to reopen up that segment for the voicemails of the week.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.480
I'll let you know the topic a little later on in the program.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.560
We'll take your calls on the new 800 number a little bit later.

31:05.560 --> 31:09.080
The old 916 number still works for those of you in the area, but I imagine most people

31:09.080 --> 31:11.280
probably aren't going to want to use that.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.980
Tonight marks the last week of our DDR previews.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.820
New songs for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.

31:16.820 --> 31:20.400
Too bad that today's last week, but we've been doing it for eight weeks, and we've got

31:20.400 --> 31:22.100
some new songs for you guys tonight.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.600
Very excited about that.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.080
Orange Lounge Radio has a brand new YouTube channel.

31:26.080 --> 31:30.400
If you listened to last week's episode, I believe I threatened to put something up.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.000
Oh, the Loki drunk thing playing Mario Kart.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.400
I threatened to put that up on YouTube.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.200
I did, so check that out.

31:36.200 --> 31:39.880
We are on YouTube under username Orange Lounge Radio, and some folks have already found the

31:39.880 --> 31:40.880
videos and are subscribing to them.

31:40.880 --> 31:45.680
I'm sure that was of excellent quality seeing as, you know, I think it was formatted for

31:45.680 --> 31:46.680
the PSP.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.880
It actually didn't come out that bad.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.600
It actually came out pretty good.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.040
I put some other stuff up there, too.

31:51.040 --> 31:55.480
We have some news bits, like you remember the Oh, It's So Much Fun clip?

31:55.480 --> 31:59.300
That's up there as well on YouTube, but one of them, there's a Guitar Hero story that

31:59.300 --> 32:03.160
has Dark Soccer and Loki in it, and it came out squished for some reason.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.160
The video is squished.

32:04.160 --> 32:08.360
It's letterboxed, but not really, so I don't know what to do about that, but it's all there

32:08.360 --> 32:11.120
if you folks want to check it out.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.980
All right, let's get into some news.

32:12.980 --> 32:17.720
Loki's going to start us off tonight, and he's going to cover some things that happened

32:17.720 --> 32:21.560
because we pre-taped on Wednesday, and usually we do our show on Sunday, so he's going to

32:21.560 --> 32:25.360
kind of do a bit of a gap story, so things we didn't get a chance to talk about last

32:25.360 --> 32:26.360
week that we should have.

32:26.360 --> 32:30.120
And pretty much the only thing that we missed talking about was the PlayStation Day in San

32:30.120 --> 32:35.460
Francisco, and of course lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation 3, and a lot of

32:35.460 --> 32:39.800
things being pulled out of the PlayStation 3, including the fact that they will not have

32:39.800 --> 32:42.000
a gamer score system.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.040
Originally they were going to be putting out that entitlement system that everyone had

32:46.040 --> 32:50.200
a problem with because it kind of ripped off of the Xbox Live achievement system.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.780
Well, that's not going to happen according to Jack Trenton from Sony.

32:54.780 --> 32:57.160
There's no gamer score system at all.

32:57.160 --> 33:03.360
They just kind of ran out of time and didn't feel like putting it in there, so very interesting

33:03.360 --> 33:04.360
there.

33:04.360 --> 33:10.680
And if you happen to be lucky enough to snag one of the first PlayStation 3s out there,

33:10.680 --> 33:17.480
one of the first 500,000 of course, you may be getting a copy of Talladega Nights on Blu-ray,

33:17.480 --> 33:20.880
because of course they really want to push that Blu-ray format with the Blu-ray drive

33:20.880 --> 33:25.960
being in the actual console, so you get to enjoy that Will Ferrell comedy.

33:25.960 --> 33:30.280
And it was actually pretty good, so definitely worth it, kind of like the Spider-Man 2 on

33:30.280 --> 33:31.280
the PSP.

33:31.280 --> 33:37.400
Anyways, some other stuff you'll be getting with your system of course, you probably want

33:37.400 --> 33:44.080
to be getting some games, and their launch games have really kind of slimmed down a bit.

33:44.080 --> 33:51.280
Sony's first party stuff, they've got Resistance, Fall of Man, NBA 07, and Genji Days of Blade.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.480
Those will all be launch titles.

33:53.480 --> 33:58.840
Now of course, Lair and Warhawk have been pushed to next year, so you won't see those

33:58.840 --> 34:00.200
for a while.

34:00.200 --> 34:06.080
Some other wonderful third party games though, of course the exclusive Full Auto 2 will be

34:06.080 --> 34:13.960
coming out from Sega, Until Legends Dark Kingdom, Ridge Racer 7, and of course they will also

34:13.960 --> 34:20.920
be getting versions of Fear, Fight Night Round 3, Elder Scrolls, Oblivion, Blazing Angels,

34:20.920 --> 34:24.400
Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk's Project 8, and all the big stuff.

34:24.400 --> 34:30.840
So it's an interesting launch window, I don't know.

34:30.840 --> 34:36.360
Anywho, some stuff not Sony related.

34:36.360 --> 34:41.000
Luminous Live, now there's been of course a lot of controversy over the whole buy half

34:41.000 --> 34:46.720
of a game, purchase the rest of the game later on kind of format.

34:46.720 --> 34:52.520
Well Mitsuguchi himself actually was interviewed by IGN, and one of the questions they asked

34:52.520 --> 34:59.680
him was about that system, and of course he supports it, and basically saying Luminous

34:59.680 --> 35:04.000
when it came out on the PSP was more expensive, and he feels that I guess you should pay the

35:04.000 --> 35:06.360
same price on the 360.

35:06.360 --> 35:11.100
Well thank you very much, I'll remember that when you release any other Q Entertainment

35:11.100 --> 35:16.920
games like the wonderful 99 Nights, glad I rushed out to buy that one.

35:16.920 --> 35:21.560
I actually did rush out to buy 99 Nights because I loved the demo and everything, and I got

35:21.560 --> 35:26.040
mine for free, so glad I didn't spend money.

35:26.040 --> 35:33.800
I will say though, I will not be buying Luminous Plus or Luminous 2, or any of your Extend

35:33.800 --> 35:39.360
Extra, every Extend Extra, screw you, I'm not buying that crap either.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.760
And I will buy them all because I'm a whore.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.240
Actually I probably won't get the PS2 one, that is a little bit of overkill, but I do

35:44.240 --> 35:48.200
want Luminous 2 and I do want every Extend Extra, so what can I say.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.200
Sorry.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.000
Whatever.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.800
So that pretty much does it for the big stories that we missed in that little bit of a gap,

35:55.800 --> 35:59.480
I want to do some comments from chat real fast because the chat room is just lit up

35:59.480 --> 36:00.640
on some of this stuff.

36:00.640 --> 36:05.200
Jeremy Todd 1 says they ran out of time, it's kind of interesting to know that the 360 came

36:05.200 --> 36:09.440
out a year earlier than PlayStation 3 and yet it has achievements, and so the PlayStation

36:09.440 --> 36:13.520
3 had an extra year to get it, but they couldn't even get this simple feature?

36:13.520 --> 36:16.520
I don't know, lack of achievements, is that going to kill the PS3?

36:16.520 --> 36:17.920
I don't think it's a big deal.

36:17.920 --> 36:23.160
I don't think that's really a big deal, but I think what's really interesting is some

36:23.160 --> 36:28.800
of the launch games not having online support, that is a big deal right there I think.

36:28.800 --> 36:34.440
This just adds one of those little mouth protectors in Kudaragi's helmet.

36:34.440 --> 36:39.720
You're an achievement point, Torloki, does this lower your opinion of Sony or do you

36:39.720 --> 36:40.720
really care?

36:40.720 --> 36:41.720
Not really.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.600
If anything, Microsoft has this wonderful achievement system to get me to buy games

36:44.600 --> 36:51.060
I normally probably wouldn't buy or to rent games, it kind of drives the market a little

36:51.060 --> 37:00.880
bit to get you to play more games, so I guess it would, to be honest, it's not a real deal

37:00.880 --> 37:06.220
breaker for me, but I think the lack of online and certain games for them is a deal breaker

37:06.220 --> 37:07.220
for me.

37:07.220 --> 37:12.320
And the other thing is they haven't really still haven't said what their online service

37:12.320 --> 37:16.920
has, and they're saying it's free, but I don't see multiplayer gaming as...

37:16.920 --> 37:18.400
They showed a friends list.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.640
Okay, friends list is free, you get that free with Xbox Live, but they still have not come

37:22.640 --> 37:26.000
out and said multiplayer gaming is free.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.960
They have not said that yet, so I'm thinking it's probably not free.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.920
Shadow Charlie in our chat room says, what about backwards memory card support for PlayStation

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
3?

37:35.920 --> 37:36.920
You've got to buy something for that, though.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.920
Yeah, there's a little adapter.

37:37.920 --> 37:42.280
You can do that with the 360, but you've got to buy something, so mind if I ask you that?

37:42.280 --> 37:47.160
Well, you know what, at least they're putting out the actual device to do it instead of

37:47.160 --> 37:48.160
some third party.

37:48.160 --> 37:55.320
I mean, props to them for that, but I don't know, they're pretty much coming out with

37:55.320 --> 37:57.000
equivalents for everything.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.960
Fireboma in our chat says, I thought it wasn't a Sony launch until Ridge Racer game was launched

38:00.960 --> 38:01.960
with it.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.200
That's true, it's got to be a Ridge Racer.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.680
Ridge Racer, I had to, at least one more time.

38:06.680 --> 38:10.080
I think this is interesting.

38:10.080 --> 38:15.400
Kendro lends an interesting perspective here on the Luminous microtransactions debate.

38:15.400 --> 38:19.640
If microtransactions total the price of a normal game, then that's kind of cool, and

38:19.640 --> 38:23.960
as somebody had calculated above, if you buy Luminous and all the microtransactions, it's

38:23.960 --> 38:25.040
going to be about $35.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.400
Well, let me put it this way.

38:27.400 --> 38:32.880
It's either they release it on live and you have the option to buy these microtransactions,

38:32.880 --> 38:39.000
or they just port it and throw it out on a CD or DVD and just put it in there and you

38:39.000 --> 38:43.160
get it all anyways, and it's all the same game, kind of like Luminous Plus.

38:43.160 --> 38:47.080
What I didn't like about the whole thing is I felt they weren't very upfront about telling

38:47.080 --> 38:48.720
us what the game was not going to have.

38:48.720 --> 38:52.900
I was very disappointed to find VS Computer wasn't there, because that's kind of a way

38:52.900 --> 38:57.240
you could unlock skins in the original PSP version, so I kind of went there to try and

38:57.240 --> 38:59.360
unlock more skins, and you kind of couldn't do it.

38:59.360 --> 39:02.400
So that was a little bit disappointing, and I didn't realize that feature was going to

39:02.400 --> 39:05.360
be gone, or well, have one stage only.

39:05.360 --> 39:10.120
I can understand downloading more skins, but I don't like downloading new features.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.320
I shouldn't have to buy two-player.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.440
You know what, Blaze says they could have packaged Luminous as a real game and no one

39:16.440 --> 39:22.980
would be bitching, and you know what, I don't know, it would have been a little less deceptive

39:22.980 --> 39:23.980
in my mind.

39:23.980 --> 39:26.640
I don't know, there's a certain element of deception with this whole thing.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.480
Maybe I'm being overreactive, I don't know.

39:28.480 --> 39:33.120
Well, also one thing to consider being in the video game industry is the production

39:33.120 --> 39:39.040
costs, you know, they would have to not only go through rigorous testing to ensure that

39:39.040 --> 39:46.360
all of the content in the game follows Microsoft's strict rules, but also how much it would cost

39:46.360 --> 39:53.800
to send and make the CDs and the manuals and things like that, otherwise you could just

39:53.800 --> 39:54.800
buy it online.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.980
True, but don't the online games go through a similar process?

39:57.980 --> 40:02.120
Maybe it's not as rigid, but the way, because remember when we had that story a couple weeks

40:02.120 --> 40:05.920
back about how Duke Nukem wasn't going to be on Xbox Live anytime soon because it would

40:05.920 --> 40:10.200
have to go through a process, and Microsoft supposedly has all these games in a queue

40:10.200 --> 40:15.720
waiting to go on the arcade, so maybe there is still a process, but maybe it's less stringent

40:15.720 --> 40:20.120
than having to put the manual, do the clamshells, all that stuff.

40:20.120 --> 40:25.400
So it would definitely cost less to go straight to Live.

40:25.400 --> 40:30.300
I think the reason why they did it on Live to begin with was so they could, it started

40:30.300 --> 40:34.560
off as a microtransactions thing, it was like, oh we could sell the Madonna skin and we could

40:34.560 --> 40:38.120
sell whatever other artist skins we're going to have, and then it just turned into, hey

40:38.120 --> 40:40.500
let's microtransaction for everything!

40:40.500 --> 40:43.240
But there's some interesting perspectives, I know we got an email on this too, so I'll

40:43.240 --> 40:47.000
save that for the mailbag that lends an interesting perspective as well.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.360
Well I'm sure we've got more stories about it too, I know there's other stuff this week,

40:51.360 --> 40:55.560
but I haven't looked at the show rules, so good job prepping for tonight.

40:55.560 --> 41:00.060
For example, the whole Madden training videos thing where they want you to buy that stuff,

41:00.060 --> 41:07.080
I think people are starting to see, oh microtransactions are working, then everyone's jumping on bandwagon,

41:07.080 --> 41:09.880
but no one's getting it right.

41:09.880 --> 41:15.720
It's kind of like one of those things, like back when motion sensing, ooh motion sensing

41:15.720 --> 41:22.980
is cool, let's all release motion sensing stuff now, and not everyone has it, or stuff

41:22.980 --> 41:24.960
for the DS.

41:24.960 --> 41:29.240
Touchscreen is awesome, let's make more games supporting touchscreen, like some games had

41:29.240 --> 41:34.440
the touchscreen with pause, just retarded stuff like that, so some people don't get

41:34.440 --> 41:35.440
it.

41:35.440 --> 41:39.080
We've got to keep it moving here, we're like 40 minutes into the show and two stories in,

41:39.080 --> 41:44.260
so I want to mention this story, this was another one from last week, but this was so

41:44.260 --> 41:50.040
huge that it's still being blogged about this week, and this is a feature in the video game

41:50.040 --> 41:57.720
Bully, that gaygamer.net and another site, I believe it was Game Brink, captured videos

41:57.720 --> 42:03.560
of hot boy-on-boy action, basically, that the main character in the game, Jimmy Hopkins,

42:03.560 --> 42:06.000
can kiss boys as well as girls in the game.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Hey boy.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.200
Actually, I believe there were certain ones.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.240
You have to inspect them first and you'll have an action option for kiss.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.700
There's about 10% of the characters you can do that to.

42:17.700 --> 42:24.340
And they have the same animation as the females.

42:24.340 --> 42:30.040
It's causing this big controversy, I don't know, I sit back at this and I go, and keep

42:30.040 --> 42:33.520
in mind I'm gay myself, and I'm looking at this going, this is a way bigger deal than

42:33.520 --> 42:34.520
it ought to be.

42:34.520 --> 42:40.800
I'm just sitting here going, when it was in the Sims, it was like, okay, hey, you can

42:40.800 --> 42:44.080
just do this if you want or do this if you want, but now it seems to be like, I don't

42:44.080 --> 42:47.800
know, with all these sites reporting on it and all this stuff, you guys are making a

42:47.800 --> 42:52.880
big deal out of what shouldn't, it's just, hey, if you want to play the game like this,

42:52.880 --> 42:57.720
if you want to try this, like Fable, yeah, and Fable, you kind of did that too.

42:57.720 --> 43:01.320
I don't know why this is such a, it's dumb, and you know why?

43:01.320 --> 43:05.120
Because people are looking, they are, I swear to God, people are just making Rockstar fucking

43:05.120 --> 43:06.700
scapegoat for everything.

43:06.700 --> 43:10.640
They are scrutinizing these games to find something wrong so they can go and sue them

43:10.640 --> 43:11.640
some more.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.640
You know what?

43:12.640 --> 43:18.680
Before you go and start doing that, be warned that they did put this content, they brought

43:18.680 --> 43:22.080
it to the attention of the ERSRB when they were giving it a team rating.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.800
So you know what?

43:23.800 --> 43:29.280
Fuck off, because this is all kosher, you know, people approved this for the team rating,

43:29.280 --> 43:30.760
and that's it, that's the game, play it.

43:30.760 --> 43:34.840
You know, at least, hey, at least he's not fucking bashing skulls in or, you know, eating

43:34.840 --> 43:40.000
brains or something like that, just, it's just fucking kissing, that's all it is.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
You know what?

43:41.000 --> 43:46.300
By curious people, there are tons of them in college and stuff, who gives a shit about

43:46.300 --> 43:52.720
just, you know, a fictional character who's not even real kissing a fictional character

43:52.720 --> 43:56.760
who's not even real who happens to be disguised as a male person.

43:56.760 --> 44:02.320
I mean, these are, it's like saying, oh, you know, two puppets making out, oh, but they're

44:02.320 --> 44:06.540
male puppets, you know, so that's really wrong.

44:06.540 --> 44:12.440
And nobody really cried out about the whole, you know, blowjob scene in Team America that

44:12.440 --> 44:16.680
I noticed, because they were puppets.

44:16.680 --> 44:21.960
Well, I don't know, I mean, I understand, you know, why, you know, especially, you know,

44:21.960 --> 44:26.840
gay gaming sites would be a little bit, you know, yay about this, because they, you don't

44:26.840 --> 44:28.720
get this option in a lot of games.

44:28.720 --> 44:32.480
You don't, you don't really, you know, so it's kind of nice to see sandbox games going

44:32.480 --> 44:36.160
towards that, hey, you know, if we're going to interact a romance element into this and

44:36.160 --> 44:39.840
we truly want to be, you know, open, hey, we're going to, you know, so I applaud that

44:39.840 --> 44:43.700
Rockstar did this, but I can't help but take, you know, so I'm not saying it's a bad thing

44:43.700 --> 44:44.700
at all.

44:44.700 --> 44:45.700
I think it's great.

44:45.700 --> 44:46.700
I think it's awesome.

44:46.700 --> 44:51.640
I think, you know, I'm very glad to see that, you know, that's kind of being put into games,

44:51.640 --> 44:56.240
you know, and the true sandbox idea of do whatever you want, literally.

44:56.240 --> 44:59.600
If they were going to be really, though, accurate about it, though, they should have had some

44:59.600 --> 45:07.080
girls just, you know, be, I'm not interested in you, I'm interested in her.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.240
Nobody would have blinked an eye.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.240
That's the other weird thing.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.240
Nobody would have blinked an eye at that.

45:11.240 --> 45:16.760
Because the vast majority, I hate to say the vast majority of gamers out there are, well,

45:16.760 --> 45:20.200
desperate young men who like to see hot lesbian action.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.680
They should just do a game called hot lesbian action.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.040
It would sell.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.880
It's called Dead or Alive Extreme.

45:26.880 --> 45:29.200
Yeah, with independently moving boobs.

45:29.200 --> 45:34.720
Where you sit on the other pair's back and do, sorry.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.720
Never mind.

45:35.720 --> 45:36.720
What were you going to say?

45:36.720 --> 45:42.920
I was going to say Vice City Stories actually has, one of the main characters is a transsexual.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.640
You don't know who it is, but one of them is, you know, we learn later on, one of them

45:46.640 --> 45:50.040
is a tranny and they have a major role in the game.

45:50.040 --> 45:55.360
So it's like Rockstar's trying to, I don't know, push the boundaries of it.

45:55.360 --> 45:59.840
I don't know, it's just, they're just, you know, writing diverse characters into their

45:59.840 --> 46:00.840
games.

46:00.840 --> 46:01.840
Exactly.

46:01.840 --> 46:02.840
You know?

46:02.840 --> 46:03.840
What's wrong with that?

46:03.840 --> 46:04.840
It's about time.

46:04.840 --> 46:08.120
You know, these kind of aren't the games that really interest me.

46:08.120 --> 46:09.120
Here's the thing.

46:09.120 --> 46:12.520
I'm not going to go buy Bully just because it has this in it and I know other people

46:12.520 --> 46:20.120
who did and I'm kind of like, you know it's a game and this is like five seconds of a

46:20.120 --> 46:21.120
game.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.120
I don't know.

46:22.120 --> 46:23.120
I don't understand why you would go.

46:23.120 --> 46:28.480
I mean, maybe they're trying to support the cause or whatever, which, okay, whatever.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.480
But you know what though?

46:29.480 --> 46:34.520
I'd go see a movie that had Christina Ricci naked or something like that.

46:34.520 --> 46:37.400
Maybe five seconds of the movie, but I'd go see because of that.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.400
All right.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.400
Point made.

46:39.400 --> 46:43.760
Well, speaking of things that have absolutely nothing to do with sexuality, unless you just

46:43.760 --> 46:51.160
happen to swing toward Master Chief that way, there is still plans by Microsoft to do the

46:51.160 --> 46:56.600
Halo movie, however, the film studios decided not to.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.240
So Microsoft has issued a statement.

46:58.240 --> 47:02.200
We were disappointed that Universal wanted to significantly renegotiate the financial

47:02.200 --> 47:06.360
points of the deal, but the Halo franchise is hugely popular and our goal remains the

47:06.360 --> 47:10.520
same, to find a partner that shares our passion and will creatively collaborate with us to

47:10.520 --> 47:13.300
best represent the story.

47:13.300 --> 47:16.760
So it may happen, but not anytime soon.

47:16.760 --> 47:20.560
Yeah, I think this just means delays, development hell.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.560
Yeah, seriously.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.560
Oh, well.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.560
You know what?

47:23.560 --> 47:28.000
If it takes that much time to get it right, I would much rather see them delay it and

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
get it right.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.720
I mean, Halo is a game, so I think the games are what a lot of us are more excited about

47:34.720 --> 47:35.780
than the movie.

47:35.780 --> 47:37.240
So Hollywood, take your time.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.840
Just don't fuck it up.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.120
Exactly.

47:40.120 --> 47:44.540
Some interesting stuff, those rumored from Game Informer is they're saying that they

47:44.540 --> 47:51.880
have an insider that's let them know that Halo 3 is going to be getting a demo early

47:51.880 --> 47:58.340
next year, and that's pretty much all we know right now is speculation.

47:58.340 --> 48:04.520
There might be a Halo 3 demo early next year, and that would make sense considering the

48:04.520 --> 48:13.280
supposed release date of Halo 3 being March or April of next year, so yeah, but duh.

48:13.280 --> 48:17.040
But one of the interesting rumors I also read about Halo 3 demos, they were saying they

48:17.040 --> 48:19.540
might charge for it.

48:19.540 --> 48:20.540
That was a weird rumor.

48:20.540 --> 48:22.260
I read that too.

48:22.260 --> 48:23.260
I don't know.

48:23.260 --> 48:29.560
The only way I could see that being, well I guess they kind of already do that.

48:29.560 --> 48:36.160
You can go to Best Buy I think and buy a World of Warcraft 14 day trial for a couple bucks.

48:36.160 --> 48:39.280
So I guess charging for demos isn't absolutely unheard of.

48:39.280 --> 48:44.640
I think it does make a lot of people go eh, but if people will pay it, they're going to

48:44.640 --> 48:45.640
get away with it.

48:45.640 --> 48:48.920
Especially if it's multiplayer and online demo, there's going to be a lot of people

48:48.920 --> 48:51.140
that are down for that.

48:51.140 --> 48:56.800
They probably do have room to get away with charging for that, so I guess we'll see.

48:56.800 --> 48:57.800
What do you think?

48:57.800 --> 48:58.800
Would you pay for a Halo 3 demo?

48:58.800 --> 48:59.800
Eh, probably.

48:59.800 --> 49:00.800
Depends on how much it is.

49:00.800 --> 49:01.800
It would be nice.

49:01.800 --> 49:06.960
If it's like five bucks, I'm not paying for that, but you know, and also I'm not really

49:06.960 --> 49:11.200
a good indicator of whether you'd pay for it or not because I would probably buy it

49:11.200 --> 49:15.120
just to report on it for the show, so you know.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.880
With the gamer in you, the regular gamer, nonjournalist in you?

49:17.880 --> 49:18.880
No.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.880
Okay.

49:19.880 --> 49:20.880
I wouldn't pay for it because, you know what I mean?

49:20.880 --> 49:21.880
I never played Halo.

49:21.880 --> 49:25.560
What if it, now here's a good idea that might justify that, what if it came with those little

49:25.560 --> 49:29.720
pictures or themes or something, came with it, like to maybe sweeten the deal?

49:29.720 --> 49:30.720
No.

49:30.720 --> 49:31.720
No?

49:31.720 --> 49:32.720
No, I wouldn't do that.

49:32.720 --> 49:36.960
Here's what I would do is I would, I subscribe to Xbox Magazine and let me get this straight.

49:36.960 --> 49:43.080
Xbox Magazine, they used to come with demos that you couldn't find on Xbox Live Marketplace

49:43.080 --> 49:45.880
and they used to get them like way early and stuff.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.980
That's not the case anymore.

49:46.980 --> 49:52.120
Their demos are almost useless now since you can get everything on Xbox Live Marketplace.

49:52.120 --> 49:56.280
I think there's only one demo that I've seen that has not hit the Marketplace and

49:56.280 --> 50:01.380
that would be Timeshift because that was before when it was being put out by Atari instead

50:01.380 --> 50:03.120
of Nvidia.

50:03.120 --> 50:09.000
So, you know, if they put it out, that's what I would say they should do is put it

50:09.000 --> 50:11.500
in the magazine.

50:11.500 --> 50:14.840
Interesting comments from our chat room, Bandit says they should not charge for the demo but

50:14.840 --> 50:17.880
should charge for the opportunity to play multiplayer in the demo.

50:17.880 --> 50:21.880
Well, you know, because servers cost money to maintain, I guess, although no other multiplayer

50:21.880 --> 50:23.920
demos have been charged as of yet.

50:23.920 --> 50:28.680
Let's see, ShadowNextGen makes it very clear, I'm not paying for a demo.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.440
I ain't doing it.

50:30.440 --> 50:35.120
Let's see, VidPower says Halo 3 will be microtransactions.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.000
Spend 400 points to get the sniper rifle.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.660
Oh, I hope not.

50:38.660 --> 50:39.660
I hope not.

50:39.660 --> 50:40.660
I don't think so.

50:40.660 --> 50:42.480
Because it's going to give people money.

50:42.480 --> 50:43.480
Maps maybe.

50:43.480 --> 50:44.840
I would see maps.

50:44.840 --> 50:47.360
I think the way they did it in Halo 1 was great.

50:47.360 --> 50:50.820
You know, if you are an addict and you have to have these maps right now, great.

50:50.820 --> 50:53.240
Pay for them and then in three months they'll be free.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.240
You know?

50:54.240 --> 50:55.240
I don't know.

50:55.240 --> 50:58.040
But I think it would throw off the balance of the game to have some people get the sniper

50:58.040 --> 51:02.660
rifles but some people don't, you know, and we're arbitrarily picking a weapon here.

51:02.660 --> 51:06.760
We don't mean that that's actually going to happen but I just hope they use caution in

51:06.760 --> 51:08.320
the microtransactions.

51:08.320 --> 51:11.240
Maybe learning a little bit from this luminous backlash that's going on.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.880
What about EA?

51:12.880 --> 51:14.640
Jeremy Todd 1 is a very interesting point.

51:14.640 --> 51:20.200
People who don't have their 360 connected to live will find the OXM's demo very useful.

51:20.200 --> 51:23.880
Some people that play Halo don't play it on live because it does have a very thorough

51:23.880 --> 51:24.960
story mode in it.

51:24.960 --> 51:28.000
So something to think about.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.800
Alright, anyway, one other story about the 360.

51:32.800 --> 51:36.220
It's possible that there's going to be a dashboard update this week.

51:36.220 --> 51:40.440
Now this is speculation but the speculation is coming from something Major Nelson said

51:40.440 --> 51:42.520
in his latest podcast.

51:42.520 --> 51:46.320
He was talking to a developer on the show and basically they were talking about the

51:46.320 --> 51:49.060
wireless communicator that's coming out very soon.

51:49.060 --> 51:52.040
The wireless communicator is scheduled to come out October 31st.

51:52.040 --> 51:55.760
Major Nelson said, you know, if you were to go to the store today and buy it, you can't

51:55.760 --> 51:58.520
use it until the fall upgrade to the dashboard.

51:58.520 --> 52:01.860
Well then that gets people to think, okay, so he's saying that if, because this came

52:01.860 --> 52:06.220
out last week, this podcast, if you have this communicator early, it's not going to do you

52:06.220 --> 52:07.220
any good.

52:07.220 --> 52:09.720
So no worries trying to go find a leaked one.

52:09.720 --> 52:15.280
But if the actual date for this is the 31st and it's not going to work until the dashboard

52:15.280 --> 52:19.120
update goes into effect, doesn't that mean that the dashboard update needs to happen

52:19.120 --> 52:21.240
on the 31st or they're going to have some angry customers?

52:21.240 --> 52:24.120
They would need to put it up beforehand.

52:24.120 --> 52:27.660
And I think it's about the time to do that anyways because you're going to want to have

52:27.660 --> 52:32.880
the dashboard update ready for the 7th when the HD DVD player comes out.

52:32.880 --> 52:37.280
You're going to want to have, you know, the update ready for when the PlayStation 3 comes

52:37.280 --> 52:41.000
out, so you have that 1080p and you can compete with them.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.640
And whatever other fun stuff they want to throw in there, more backwards compatibility

52:44.640 --> 52:45.640
maybe.

52:45.640 --> 52:49.820
You know, hey, maybe it'd be nice if they had some Ultimate Mortal Combat, or Mortal

52:49.820 --> 52:54.160
Combat Annihilation, you know, backwards compatibility on there, I'd like to play with that, but

52:54.160 --> 52:55.160
you know.

52:55.160 --> 52:56.840
We'll see what happens.

52:56.840 --> 53:00.520
If anything, if it's not this week, it's very soon.

53:00.520 --> 53:04.080
Do you think that they've been quiet about the dashboard update because they don't want

53:04.080 --> 53:07.120
people going, when's it coming out, Major Nelson, when's it coming out, Major Nelson,

53:07.120 --> 53:08.120
when's it coming out?

53:08.120 --> 53:13.280
Well, I'm sure he's trying to be quiet about anything, yeah, just because his fanbase is

53:13.280 --> 53:14.280
a little...

53:14.280 --> 53:15.280
...needy.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.280
...bitchy.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.280
...needy.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.280
Are you there?

53:18.280 --> 53:19.280
Are you there?

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Are you there?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
Are you there?

53:21.280 --> 53:22.280
Yeah.

53:22.280 --> 53:23.280
Major Nelson seems like a really great guy.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.280
I've never met him in person.

53:24.280 --> 53:25.280
He seems really cool.

53:25.280 --> 53:29.720
I will turn this dashboard update around if you do not behave.

53:29.720 --> 53:34.080
But if you read those comments on his board, and you know it's getting to him because,

53:34.080 --> 53:37.400
you know, he's sad to make some changes, yeah, I'd be so annoyed too.

53:37.400 --> 53:38.720
All right, anyway.

53:38.720 --> 53:43.840
Well, something that may annoy other people in regards to Microsoft is that there's actually

53:43.840 --> 53:51.120
indications that they favor the live gold account above the platinum ones.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.120
Well, they should...

53:52.120 --> 53:53.120
Over the silver?

53:53.120 --> 53:54.120
I'm sorry, over the silver.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.120
They should.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.120
I'm paying for it.

53:56.120 --> 54:04.520
Well, basically they're saying that, especially for some of the demos that are coming out,

54:04.520 --> 54:09.760
they're releasing them to the gold accounts before they're releasing them to the silver.

54:09.760 --> 54:16.480
So you'll get the newer trailers, the newer demos, instead of, you know, having to wait

54:16.480 --> 54:19.200
for them because they're releasing them about a week or so afterwards.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.200
That's fine.

54:20.200 --> 54:27.400
That's perfect because it's more incentive to go play on gold, and you know what, hey,

54:27.400 --> 54:28.400
it's free.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.600
You can't complain if you're getting demos later on.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.600
Just whatever.

54:31.600 --> 54:32.600
Pay for it.

54:32.600 --> 54:36.080
So if you're paying 50 bucks for your year subscription, you should be getting your stuff.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.080
Exactly.

54:37.080 --> 54:41.040
You should have some sort of perks, and I'm surprised there hasn't really been much more

54:41.040 --> 54:42.040
other than this.

54:42.040 --> 54:43.040
I mean, so...

54:43.040 --> 54:46.800
If not, then if you've got the silver, if you want them at the same time, they should

54:46.800 --> 54:55.000
do some sort of pay-by-download for those, if you want to get them ahead of time, but

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
other than that...

54:56.000 --> 54:58.920
50 dollars a year is really not that expensive.

54:58.920 --> 55:02.080
And they do giveaways and specials all the time.

55:02.080 --> 55:05.560
It's expensive next to free, which is what PlayStation 3 is promising, although I know

55:05.560 --> 55:09.640
they haven't said anything about, I just, you know, I just have a feeling it's going

55:09.640 --> 55:10.640
to be free.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.240
I think they've kind of insinuated it, you know what I mean?

55:13.240 --> 55:15.400
But I don't think they're going to come out of nowhere and say, surprise, you're going

55:15.400 --> 55:16.400
to have to pay for this.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.560
I'm going to piss more people off with that.

55:17.560 --> 55:20.840
I think Sony is in a corner now where they have to make it free.

55:20.840 --> 55:25.640
Didn't they have that comparison chart that got them in a lot of trouble, that was comparing

55:25.640 --> 55:31.020
the Sony PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360, and it was talking about like, hey, this comes

55:31.020 --> 55:35.320
with it, and on Xbox, it was basically trying to show the Xbox 360 actually costs more than

55:35.320 --> 55:38.880
the PlayStation 3, like it was that comparison, and one of the things was they talked about

55:38.880 --> 55:43.240
Play Online, and it was free on PlayStation 3, so I'm pretty sure it's going to be...

55:43.240 --> 55:45.720
Well, 50 a month, though, it's not that expensive.

55:45.720 --> 55:53.760
You're technically paying about, I think, $4.17 a month, if you consider, which is less

55:53.760 --> 56:02.400
than the cost of lunch, so if you think about it in the big picture, you really are not

56:02.400 --> 56:05.200
paying all that much for your subscription cost for Live.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.440
Couple quick comments in chat.

56:06.440 --> 56:09.800
Blaze says, good, if I'm paying $50 a year, I should get it earlier.

56:09.800 --> 56:13.960
JeremyTau1 says, I'd rather pay $50 a year for Live, which has a lot more neat features

56:13.960 --> 56:18.600
than have the free PS3 Online service, and it having not as many features, so interesting

56:18.600 --> 56:19.600
point there as well.

56:19.600 --> 56:20.600
Pay for what you get.

56:20.600 --> 56:21.600
All right.

56:21.600 --> 56:25.320
ShadowNextGen agrees, $50 a year for Xbox Live is a great value.

56:25.320 --> 56:28.000
All right.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Interesting.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
I don't know.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.080
I mean, I'm glad that they have some perks for the gold people.

56:35.080 --> 56:41.280
Anywho, some other fun stuff that's come out about Halo 3 this week, mainly leaked from

56:41.280 --> 56:47.360
a Swedish magazine called Level, they've had some actual screenshots and stuff, and of

56:47.360 --> 56:52.400
course, brand new info about the game, including some new weapons like Spiker, which is a new

56:52.400 --> 56:57.720
brute weapon, a Spartan laser that apparently tears vehicles apart, and a nail grenade,

56:57.720 --> 57:00.440
which sticks in the walls and sends nails everywhere.

57:00.440 --> 57:05.400
Brand new vehicles like the Mongoose, which is like a miniature ATV for two passengers

57:05.400 --> 57:10.680
with no weapons on it, and then the one that people are hoping is mistranslated, but the

57:10.680 --> 57:17.320
Man Cannon, which launches players into the air, kind of like jump pads in Unreal or Quake

57:17.320 --> 57:19.080
Arena.

57:19.080 --> 57:20.080
Come step in, sir.

57:20.080 --> 57:23.000
You want to see my Man Cannon?

57:23.000 --> 57:24.520
Some interesting stuff.

57:24.520 --> 57:27.560
They're going to be having the left and right trigger weapons.

57:27.560 --> 57:34.320
You'll be able to reload them separately using the left and right shoulder buttons, and apparently

57:34.320 --> 57:39.440
the X button has some sort of secret functionality to it that they haven't mentioned yet.

57:39.440 --> 57:41.440
Man Cannon.

57:41.440 --> 57:43.400
It's not the Man Cannon.

57:43.400 --> 57:47.440
Some other interesting stuff is it's going to be coming out in three different SKUs.

57:47.440 --> 57:51.240
The first one is game only, the second one will be a collector's edition, and the third

57:51.240 --> 57:59.100
one is the legendary edition, which includes a replica of Master Chief's helmet, which

57:59.100 --> 58:05.040
is miniaturized, it's about cat size, so you can put it on your cat, or your Man Cannon.

58:05.040 --> 58:09.480
It's also going to include documentaries, developer commentary, spinoff material like

58:09.480 --> 58:15.400
Red vs. Blue, Spark of Life, etc., and all the cut scenes from Halo 1.53 and HD on a

58:15.400 --> 58:16.400
separate disc.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.400
That's kind of cool.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.480
And maybe a sneak peek at the Halo movie, they're just speculating right now.

58:20.480 --> 58:24.680
But lots of screenshots, looks very pretty, very, very pretty.

58:24.680 --> 58:30.480
Of course, also coming out at the same time, not to be outdone by this leaked information,

58:30.480 --> 58:37.920
one up had to mention that EGM will be also having some content on Halo 3, which by the

58:37.920 --> 58:46.180
looks of their content, almost identical to what is in that Swedish magazine, and yeah,

58:46.180 --> 58:49.880
so they'll be coming, in fact they're going to be doing three weeks of coverage for Halo

58:49.880 --> 58:51.880
3.

58:51.880 --> 58:56.640
I thought usually you did that leading up to a game's release.

58:56.640 --> 59:01.280
This is just randomly, hey folks, three weeks of Halo 3 stuff.

59:01.280 --> 59:06.060
Okay, well, okay, that's what you want to do.

59:06.060 --> 59:10.960
That whole Man Cannon thing reminds me of when we were playing F.E.A.R. last night,

59:10.960 --> 59:20.400
and there's a weapon in there called the Penetrator, so if that gives you any indication, so anyway.

59:20.400 --> 59:24.360
Let's see, PooEater says, okay, so I'm guessing Man Cannon will be the next joke we run into

59:24.360 --> 59:27.480
the ground, most likely, most likely.

59:27.480 --> 59:32.120
DJ Morpheus asks, hello, by the way, to our good buddy DJ Morpheus, honestly, who really

59:32.120 --> 59:34.800
looks at the developer extras?

59:34.800 --> 59:36.880
That's kind of a good question.

59:36.880 --> 59:38.440
It depends on the game.

59:38.440 --> 59:43.400
I wouldn't buy this Halo 3 Uber edition or whatever, that's too much crap, but I know

59:43.400 --> 59:45.360
people who love their Halo.

59:45.360 --> 59:49.040
I might do that just to put a Halo helmet in my cube.

59:49.040 --> 59:52.400
I don't really have a lot of game memorabilia, and that might be kind of fun.

59:52.400 --> 59:55.120
I have to see what it looks like, if it looks retarded, I'm not buying it.

59:55.120 --> 01:00:00.480
Well, no, I actually love seeing all of the behind the scenes stuff, being in a design

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:06.520
major myself, I love seeing all the artistic elements that go behind it, but when we got

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.640
the Toy Story box set, I was watching all the rendering errors first, before I was even

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.960
watching the movies, because I'm just into all that kind of stuff.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960
I think it's great.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.880
I like the ones in Shrek, though, where the donkey turns into a big fuzzy porcupine looking

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.880
thing.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.320
Well, I personally wouldn't mind buying the extra stuff.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.680
For Company of Heroes, which is an RTS game for the PC, they had just the regular edition

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.680
and they had the special silver edition, and with the special silver edition, they had

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:40.720
a DVD with special features of how they made the storyline, the people they interviewed,

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.800
and it even came with little flashcards, so that you can see what type of tanks you were

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:52.000
fighting and what were some of their names and some of the weak spots and everything,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.160
so it was pretty interesting for those people who love World War II.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:01.400
I'm getting the collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII, so I can watch all the extras

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:09.640
that are going to be there, and yes, I probably will watch them, because I'm sad.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.160
This is another game I believe has a collector's edition, yes, Gears of War has a collector's

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.160
edition coming out.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.920
Well, Gears of War has gone gold-ish.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.200
It has gone officially gold, too, it's gold.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:26.360
Cliffy B says, my job as designer of Gears of War is well more or less done, and that

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.800
was coming from his official blog, so it does look like Gears of War is going to make it

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800
out there on time.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.520
Then it was actually, I think, later on that week also, it was also officially gold.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.880
I believe Major Nelson kind of dropped that bomb a little later, I think, from what I'm

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.880
reading.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.880
Yeah, they're all ready to go.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.880
So, the game will be out on time, doesn't look like any delays are going to happen unless

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.980
something really screws up, but that's exciting, because for the Halo 3, folks, this is a real

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.460
hold-em-over game.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.560
Even for non-Halo people, maybe this is something.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.560
It's really cool-looking.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:02.180
Yeah, I hope there's a demo on Marketplace, so I can check it out, because it looked really

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.380
cool at E3, but watching and playing are two very, very different things.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.920
I'm buying it.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.440
Maybe I'll borrow yours, then, and check it out first.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.480
I do think I want it, though, after Final Fantasy XII is beaten.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.440
I'm not getting Final Fantasy XII, though.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.520
Look, I'm going to say this.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.040
I've been a very, very good boy.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:25.680
There is a pirated copy of Final Fantasy XII sitting on the floor of my living room right

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.200
now, and I haven't touched it.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.880
I'm being good, and I'm being a very good boy.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.720
Well it's kind of on someone else's PlayStation's hard drive, so I can't really give that away.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:42.800
I'm not going to name names, but he's sitting in this room, and it's not me.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.240
I'm not touching it.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.200
I'm going to wait and buy a legitimate copy of the game when it comes out, because I want

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.200
to do the sappy, like, oh, I'm going to play it on launch day like everyone, and I got

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:58.360
the call today that says they're just going to do the midnight launch party at GameStop,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.760
so I'm tempted to take a camera.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.280
Does somebody want to go with me late tomorrow?

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.220
I'll go with you if you want to get me a copy.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.220
Take a video camera?

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:05.220
Tomorrow.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.840
I'm not going to buy you that game after you bashed on it on this program, so you hate

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840
the battle system.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840
You can kiss my butt.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.440
Actually, actually, actually, actually, there are things about that game that make me want

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.120
it, but I'm still so busy.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.440
I really am getting into PSU now, but you let me make a game on my memory card, so I

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.440
play over here.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.240
GameStops have had Final Fantasy XII since, like, Friday, by the way.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.680
Yeah, so did CompUSA, but they put them all out on the shelves, from what I hear, but

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.080
I'm being good, and I'm waiting.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.400
Did somebody want to come, like, we could take a video camera, do something for YouTube.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.400
I'll go with you.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.400
I don't know.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.400
I've got to work on Tuesday.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.400
Yeah, we'll see.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.560
I do, too, but hey, staying up late might be fun.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.200
Well, speaking of things, though, that are kind of messed up, you know, they broke a

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.040
particular Walmart in Arkansas, broke street date for Guitar Hero 2.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.800
It was actually reported on, so since it's actually supposed to be released on November

01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:02.080
7th, and Walmart said, uh-uh, we're releasing it now, then maybe your local Walmart will

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080
have it.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.240
I'm actually sort of thinking about making a run by Walmart, just because I have to play

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.240
Trogdor.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.160
If you know, this is kind of a, well, it's a related story.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:22.600
You know you can actually hack the demo to play the songs that were unlocked in the game.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.600
Apparently they were on the demo disc.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.080
Way to go, programmers!

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.080
You rock!

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.840
Keeping that content on discs.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.680
This is how hot coffee happens.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.920
Anyways, so yeah, apparently you can hack the demo.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.920
They have some programming.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.920
I've got the demo at my house.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920
Yeah.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.920
I have to see what's what.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.360
They have Trogdor on there.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.600
I don't get it, because I will just keep going back to playing YYZ over and over and over

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600
again.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.720
I was even watching this live performance of Rush doing that on YouTube, with the longest

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.480
drum solo ever.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.400
I am actually passing on Guitar Hero 2 until the 360 version.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.440
I sold my Guitar Hero today.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.440
Wow.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.760
I'm going to probably get both.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:11.700
As much as I really enjoy Red Octane and so forth, I actually really like Guitar Freaks,

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.440
and that's where my allegiance goes to.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.640
It goes to Konami, I'm sorry.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640
Oh, interesting.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.520
Actually, I would say you're a little bit in the minority there.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.760
A lot of people don't really prefer Guitar Freaks.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.320
I think it just depends on your taste in music, too.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.120
Would you say you like to listen to that Japanese rock and the stuff that's usually in those

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.120
games?

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.120
Oh, definitely.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.560
That's probably why you prefer Guitar Freaks in the end.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560
It really is about the music.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560
Yeah.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.780
I would not have been as excited about Guitar Hero 2 if it wasn't that they put bass mode

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.080
in it, which I always do on Guitar Freaks.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.080
Same here.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.320
The good thing, though, that I actually will still prefer Guitar Freaks over Guitar Hero

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.480
4 is because I've got Dramania and I've got a controller, so it's all about putting it

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.640
in session mode and just going at it when you've got a group of people.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.240
Too bad Keyboard Mania wouldn't link, but that's still...

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.600
It's not that I dislike Guitar Hero.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.680
I really do want to play Guitar Hero 2, but now it's just such a bad time.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.000
I really hate Christmas.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.080
I love it and I hate it, because they just avalanche the games on us at this period.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.680
And to some people, it's Yule.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680
Well, whatever.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680
You know what I mean.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.800
Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.520
It's just this avalanche of games right now and I can't play them all, so I might as well

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.480
just wait for the 360 version, which will have better graphics, widescreen, and maybe

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.160
some extra songs.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.160
Who knows?

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.160
We'll wait and see.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.160
And I'll play it then.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.680
You can come play at my house.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.200
Just like I played pinball this week, I forgot to say it in my gaming week, I finally got

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200
to play one at the table.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.200
I played Guns N' Roses.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200
That's right.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200
My, my, my, my, my, Michelle.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.200
All right.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.600
It was when he goes, I hate you, Michelle!

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.600
That was funny, bro.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.600
I don't hate Christmas.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.080
I don't hate chatter saying I hate Christmas.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.600
I don't hate Christmas.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.640
I hate you for saying I hate Christmas.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:56.200
Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, the full track list has been out for a little bit now, including

01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:04.680
such wonderful tracks as we mentioned, Strong Bad, Trogdor, The Burninator, from, you know,

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.920
the Homestar Runner, yes, Homestar Runner Flash animation.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.960
And if you happen to be a fan of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, you might recognize this band

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:24.000
Death Lock as they perform their hit Thunder Horse, and of course Death Lock is from Meneloc,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.280
Meneloc plus the wonderful, very violent show on Adult Swim.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.400
I think they had that on the E3 demo, didn't they?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.400
I don't think so.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.760
I thought, I remembered hearing it.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:41.520
Anyways, some other stuff that they've got coming out, I believe a new Freeze Pops, or

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:47.280
another Freeze Pops song on there, Less Talk, More Rock, yay, Freeze Pop, and some other

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:55.280
stuff and just a bunch of bands I've never heard of, Honest Bob and the Factory to Deals

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280
incentive.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:00.120
Well, these are all, you know, the indie bands that they put in there too, which is kind

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.120
of cool.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.920
So yeah, it's pretty cool, and lots of tracks, so definitely worth picking up if you have

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920
a guitar.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.920
I don't, so I won't.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.920
Well, you can buy the bundle.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.920
Why would I do that?

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.920
I just sold back the guitar.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.640
I'm waiting for the 360.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640
Which is a big mistake.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.120
Why did you announce the 360 one before this?

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.940
Because we'd be so pissed if they announced it after.

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:24.440
You would be pissed, and I would be pissed, and we'd be on this show yelling and bitching.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.440
But we'd buy it anyways.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440
Probably.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:35.220
All right, let's talk about now Guitar Hero 2 is coming out in a couple weeks, but coming

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.600
out this week, if you are in Japan, let's talk about some release dates.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.960
Xbox 360 is having a ton of stuff go to their Platinum Collection in Japan this week, including

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:49.880
99 Nights, Project Gotham Racing 3, Rumble Roses XX, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.680
Every Party.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.320
Also another Xbox 360 system is coming out.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.920
It's kind of their, you know, they talked about this earlier, they're going to release

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.260
kind of a reduced bundle in Japan.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.080
So that is out this week, Xbox Live Vision making its debut as well.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:09.040
For those of you holding out on the PlayStation 2, lots of fans still about the PS2.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.100
In Japan, you can get Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:19.600
Also coming out, Slaughter Upcore 9 and Gallop Racer in Breed.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.040
I don't leave it to you to figure out what that is, but I want to point out, this one

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040
gave us this bot.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.880
Horses with extra holds on their heads.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.160
That's how they translate it, folks.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.520
There it is, I'm looking here at this game, the Slaughter Upcore 9, it looks like it has

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.000
a Go-Go Dancer on the front there.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.560
It's a gambling simulator, so it has a little Go-Go Girl on the front there.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.480
Let's see, let me look at the box art here for this Gallop Racer.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.840
Yeah, it looks like a, it says it right there on the box, look at this, here it is, right

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.840
there in the studio.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.400
Gallop Racer in Breed, right there, 10th anniversary.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.000
I'm sorry, but is that like, is that kind of like...

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.560
If you're an inbred horse, you probably are going to gallop everywhere.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560
Mississippi horse!

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:04.480
And I can say that because I'm from the south, so it's a Mississippi horse.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.380
Now hold on though, because this doesn't beat what's coming out on the DS, okay?

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:13.280
Coming out on the DS in Japan, there's a new Kirby game, Hoshi no Kirby Sanjyou, and Lego

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:19.880
Star Wars 2 on the Nintendo DS, but here it is, the title of the week for Japanese imports,

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.520
Love Hamster on the Nintendo DS.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.200
It's a strategy game by Digital Kids, and just look at the box art, look at the box

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.440
art, how could you not love that hamster?

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.120
I want the Love Hamster!

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.720
I'm going to import Love Hamster.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.060
I have dwarf hamsters myself, and if it's anything like real hamsters, then they probably

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:48.720
should rename it to Hamster Inbreeding.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.300
Because they multiply it like crazy.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.240
Now just keep in mind, please keep your love hamsters away from your man cannons, okay?

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.840
Boys and girls, I'd appreciate that.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.480
My brain is now swimming from love hamsters.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:08.520
Well, anyway, as for our UK friends, we've got a number of things coming out.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.040
On the first, we have Sam & Max Season 1 Culture Shock for PC.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.000
On the third, a number of titles, we have Curious George for PlayStation 2, Desperate

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.100
Housewives for PC, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories on PSP, on just about everything Need

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:27.960
for Speed Carbon, Neverwinter Nights 2 on PC, Rule of Rose on PlayStation 2, Scooby

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.400
Doo Who's Watching Who on a number of things, and SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:40.400
Krusty Krab, yeah, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on PC.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:50.880
A few things, though, that should be made a mention of, I'll go ahead and list some

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.480
of them for the sixth because there's actually the biggest one coming out will be Phantasy

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.000
Star Universe coming out on the sixth of November.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.320
Other things to look forward to within the month, actually, after having played the demo,

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.120
is WWE SmackDown vs. Raw.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120
It's actually really good.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.960
And if you want to beat everybody, use Kane.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:18.040
Okay, anyways, I don't speak wrestling, sorry.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:24.560
Yeah, well, each week we like to talk about some stuff that you may not have heard yet,

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.280
and this week, of course, I'm going to start things off with a few date changes and a few

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.920
price reductions like normal.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.360
First off, the Xbox 360 games have dropped in price this week.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.120
Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 dropped down to $49.99, which is good.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.680
Battlefield 2 also dropped down to $49.99.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.000
NCAA Football 07, which hasn't been out that long, dropped down to $49.99.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.960
Burnout Revenge, which was already cheap to begin with, $29.99.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.120
I think all Xbox 360 games should drop to $49.99, a more reasonable price, don't you?

01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.920
Well, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, pretty awesome game, dropped down to $39.99, so that's

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.920
pretty cool.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.480
And, of course, if you don't have a 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox Madden dropped down to $39.99,

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.560
and the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on PlayStation 2 and Xbox dropped down to $19.99,

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.560
so not bad.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.940
Now some date changes.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.360
It's very interesting.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.040
A few things you might not have heard yet, including some of the Wii launch titles have

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.040
been delayed.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.120
It's quite interesting.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:32.080
For example, Blazing Angels on the Wii has been delayed to December 6th.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.240
Far Cry Instinct's Predator has been delayed to next year, January 16th, which is very

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.400
interesting.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.080
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Wii has been delayed to December 7th.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.080
Call of Duty 3 has also been delayed to December 7th.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:50.360
And Marvel Ultimate Alliance, December 7th.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.720
So Activision, something happened there because all their titles got delayed.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:01.160
If you're looking for Elder Scrolls Oblivion on the PS3, I mentioned it was a launch title,

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.040
but of course that's the launch window, not launch day.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.840
December 12th, it's already starting its move into March, kind of like the 360 version

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.080
was.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.560
It's slowly sneaking away.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.560
Some other games you might also be looking forward to, especially not on the PS3, but

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.200
on the 360, Fusion Frenzy 2 won't be coming out this year.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.500
It's coming out January 16th of next year.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:35.080
Some games also announced Warriors on the PSP is coming out December 13th.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.560
Silent Hill Origins has also been delayed to next year, so you won't be seeing that

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.840
until at least January 17th.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.240
I want to say I read somewhere there's some major reworking going on there, which is why

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240
it was delayed.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.280
That date has been bouncing around this week like crazy.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.520
It was in March at one time this week.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.600
It's nuts.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.600
One point though about that is that if you go in the Akira Yamaoka community on Live

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:04.280
Journal, there's actually previews to some of the tracks in the game.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.400
And then finally, two other titles were announced from Buena Vista Interactive that you haven't

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.960
heard about yet on systems.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.880
Pirates of the Caribbean 3, of course that's a working title, is going to be coming out

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:23.080
on PlayStation 3, the Wii, Xbox 360, DS, and PSP May 16th of next year.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.480
And God, why are they making this game?

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:29.640
High School Musical The Game is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.680
the DS on July 11th.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.760
Those are your dates for the week for exclusive stuff.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.480
Real quickly, footy monsters dyin' in chat here wants to know, you know the release date

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.560
for Splinter Cell Double Agent on PS2?

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.240
Splinter Cell Double Agent?

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240
For the US?

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240
Yeah.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.240
That was actually last week?

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240
For PS2?

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.220
Yeah, it came out a week after, after the 360.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:59.840
So that was last week.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.960
Some other stuff, of course, releases for this week.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.560
We've got lots of big stuff.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:12.960
This is kind of getting into the whole, you know, kind of end of the year push.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.520
Need for Speed Carbon on pretty much every single system out there except for the PlayStation

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:19.640
3 and Wii, because those are coming out a little bit later.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:27.080
Of course you've got Children of Mana on the DS, Pokemon Ranger on the DS.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.280
Of course Final Fantasy XII, because that's awesome.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:37.640
On the 360 you've got F.E.A.R., which is going to be pretty sweet.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.960
I think that was the only 360, oh FIFA Soccer 07, because it's been delayed.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:46.640
On Xbox, a lot more Racing Mania 2007, awesome.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:52.200
And of course my favorites on the PSP, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.880
And if you're not in the Vice City Stories, Death Junior Root of Evil, Killzone Liberation,

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:03.240
Blind Quiz, which is by the guy that did Brain Age, and Power Stone Collection, which is

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.600
pretty cool.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.920
So that's a little slice of the stuff coming out, not everything of course.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:15.360
As far as things coming out much later, it was actually listed in the official Xbox 360

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:21.440
magazine that Bethesda is working on a game that uses the Unreal Engine 3 called Rogue

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.440
Warrior.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.920
It's also going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 3.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.560
It's a multiplayer anti-terrorism game.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:35.040
It's actually based on books by Richard Marcinko, I think that's how it's pronounced, and being

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.680
developed by Zombie Studios.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.480
They worked on Shadow Ops prior.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:45.440
It has some different modes, including one that generates a map based on what the teams

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.640
decide on beforehand, like a cooperative map.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.280
And you're the only one who will know the territory you start off in.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:59.320
Also has a four player co-op mode, 24 and other multiplayer modes.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:06.720
Sounds pretty cool, actually, if you like those types of games.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.320
I like Bethesda.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.400
Yeah, I like Bethesda too.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.320
We have a series of oopsie things to report.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.800
There's been a lot of oopsies.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:21.760
Remember last week, the big, big oopsie with Bubble Bobble on the DS?

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.400
Nothing quite that major, but a couple big oopsies nonetheless.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:31.160
Somebody noticed just now that, I believe this was on NeoGAF, those big forums over

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:38.140
there, noticed that the GameCube Killer7 box, if you look at the back, it points you to

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:43.520
a website, www.killer7.com.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.880
Killer7.com is a porno site.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.640
The correct site should have been killer-7.com.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.160
Are you going to killer7.com right now, Loki?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.160
No, I'm not.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.520
Someone is sending me a private message.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.360
I saw him reach for the keyboard as I said that.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.800
I thought he was going to check that out right now.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:07.240
Certainly a lot of free publicity for that porno site this week, thanks to Capcom's proofreading

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240
team.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.400
Good job, Capcom.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:15.960
Some other funny oopsies have been going on, like in Glasgow, because apparently Wii's

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.760
out over there, according to some of their clocks, which have been incorrectly set up.

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:26.600
It's their countdown clocks that they have for the Wii, so now it's just saying out now,

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.920
but I don't know, big deal.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.760
So someone messed up a clock.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:37.040
Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing to put on the internet, like, hey, somebody can't set

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.080
a clock, that's gaming news.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.240
But I guess some folks are curious what it's going to look like when all is said and done.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.960
Couple website oopsies going on right now.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:55.540
Walmart was listing the PlayStation 3 for $299.82.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:20:01.240
Keep in mind the PlayStation 3 is supposed to cost at least $4.99 for the low one, $5.99

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.240
for the high one.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.320
Well, you know they do sell a lot of stuff as lost leaders.

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:08.280
Yeah, but I don't think it's supposed to be that low.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.400
I think someone made a boo-boo.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.400
Someone copied the...

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.400
Pulling back prices.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.960
That sounds like the Xbox 360 price right there, $299.82.

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.520
Also a late-breaking oopsie we got posted to our forums just before the show, I believe,

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:29.160
Tiger Claw pointed this out, CompUSA was listing a Nintendo Wii for $1,100, and I thought the

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.760
Wii was supposed to be the affordable system.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.160
That's Canadian.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:39.920
Needless to say, someone's getting fired.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.000
Maybe we should make this oopsie thing a regular segment.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.960
There certainly are enough mistakes going on out there.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:47.680
I don't know what to say about that.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.400
Apparently the Wii thing is still up.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.320
Tiger Claw is posting a link in our chat right now.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:56.720
Let me go ahead and do that, and I'll paste that in right now.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.280
I know this is wonderful radio here.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.240
Oh yeah, there it is.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:06.540
Wii console, $1,119.06.

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.720
Someone made a little bit of a mistake there.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.120
Good job, CompUSA.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:15.120
Leaking games early, selling Wiis for a couple of times.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.160
That's got to be one hell of a Wii.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.560
It better have other Wii attachments with it.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.640
Like the Mantennen.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.640
And the Penetrator.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.640
And the Love Hamster.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.160
Every week DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:39.920
and all around, and she finds a website appropriate to share with y'all.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.480
Is it killer7.com, your website of the week this week?

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480
No.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.480
Okay.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:51.720
She's got a website of the week, and she's going to share it with you right now.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:58.040
Today's website of the week is the Misadventures of Hello Cthulhu.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:03.160
It's a really messed up little webcomic that one of my friends in the Doctor Who fandom

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.960
linked to me, that's about Cthulhu being dropped in the Hello Kitty universe.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:15.560
Yes, the Elder God, Cthulhu in the Hello Kitty universe, with ribbons on his tentacles.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.320
It's very funny, and I recommend everybody go read it all the way through, because trust

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:26.560
me, it sort of has continuity, but not really, because it's just messed up, especially when

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:33.960
he turns Keropi into his evil minion, the demon Keropi.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:43.240
So the site is, and I will link it in the chatroom, www.hello-cthulhu.com, hellokuthulu.com,

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.660
with a dash in there.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:48.740
And it's really messed up, especially also when the shark pirate captain shows up and

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.740
they steal his stuff.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.240
Has Batsmaru in it at all, my favorite?

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:55.880
I haven't seen Batsmaru yet, I've seen Pompompurin, and I've also seen the tentacle monster version

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.120
of Pompompurin too.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:04.400
My favorite part is when they go to the island and are attacked by the cheese grater monster.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.000
It's really random, I recommend it.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.840
If you liked Kawaii Knot, Hello Cthulhu is even worse.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.880
Hey, before we get to the next story, I want to point out that Nintendo Maniac 64 in our

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:23.080
chatroom noticed that that amount that they were charging for the Wii on CompUSA, $1,119,

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.080
is the release date of the Wii, $1,119.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.380
Good job, good eyes.

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:30.540
So somebody just screwed up when putting things in the database and put the date where the

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:35.640
price goes, and oops, and caused panic amongst game bloggers everywhere.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.640
What can you do?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.920
Well there is a little bit more news that I have for everybody.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.760
Something that may interest somebody in the room, except I think she already knows about

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.800
it, is the LocoRoco Halloween demo.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:58.240
It also comes with a firmware update for the PSP, bringing it to 2.82.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:07.200
Basically according to our expert friends at Sony, who again, expert is used very loosely,

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:12.580
it has the extras, things that are changed, we think we've covered all this before, but

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.480
you don't really need it to play the LocoRoco demo.

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.860
You can still play it with 2.71 firmware.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:28.440
For European gamers, you can download the firmware update from yourpsp.com, or you can

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.960
also use the US one, it doesn't really matter.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.840
The LocoRoco demo is available online.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.000
It also has a US and European version.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.320
I wonder if anyone is going to dress up as a LocoRoco for Halloween.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320
That would be kind of cute.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.320
I'm not.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320
I'm going to be a pirate.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.640
I don't have a costume picked out yet.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.120
I never pick out my costume until the day of Halloween, actually.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.600
I've got this long wig.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.200
I'm going to be a pirate.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.200
Arr.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.440
Okay, by the way, I made a mistake.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.840
It was actually Black Boy who noticed it first, that the CompUSA screw up.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.160
Nintendo Maniac was just the first to type it in all caps, so I saw it.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.920
Not to encourage you all in chat to type in all caps, damn you.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.880
All right, it's getting towards the end of this segment, so that means it's time to hear

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.480
a little bit of new DDR music.

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.200
For the past eight weeks, if you can believe it, we have been premiering new songs from

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.360
Dance Dance Revolution Universe, which will be coming out on the Xbox 360, sounds like

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.920
next year, and DDR Ultramix 4, which I believe is next month.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.920
It's in November.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.880
I believe is when it's coming out, right, Loki?

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.360
Ultramix 4 is in November still?

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.800
Yes, Ultramix 4 is November 15th, last we heard.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:37.800
All right.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.200
I think the bundle's delayed a week, which is weird.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.520
They did the same thing with Supernova.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520
I don't know why.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.520
Hmm.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.520
Maybe.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.480
All right, well, anyway, we have some new songs for you guys, so you can check out some

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.080
of the songs you'll be able to dance to in these new games.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.360
We're going to start off this last batch of songs with a song from DDR Universe.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.600
It's a group called Geomancer, and the song is called Hydrasound, and it's going to start

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:14.920
off our previews tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:42.920
It's called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound,

01:26:42.920 --> 01:27:10.920
and the song is called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound, and the song is

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:36.200
called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.280
And that was Hydrasound by Geomancer here on the DDR Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.240
coming soon to DDR Universe.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.640
All right, let's go into our next song.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.400
It's from DDR UltraMix 4.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.960
It's by an artist called Steve Porter, and the song is called Sock'em, and it's coming

01:27:51.960 --> 01:28:00.960
to DDR UltraMix 4.

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:27.600
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Sock'em, and the song is called

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:45.920
Hydrasound.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:29:13.920
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:41.680
All right, we're getting down to the end here, and we have our last song we're going to preview

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:47.320
here from DDR Universe, and it's from an artist you might have recognized from the UltraMix

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:52.320
series because this artist showed up in quite a few of the games, or if is has a song in

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.560
DDR Universe, and it's called The Hop, and you're going to hear it right now on the DDR

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:22.000
Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:50.000
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:31:18.000
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And now, the very last song of our DDR previews, and before we get to this, I just want to

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.720
say a big thanks to Konami of Hawaii for giving us the opportunity to give you guys something

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.840
a little bit special here, obviously.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:52.980
If you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, you know that we've always been longtime supporters

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:57.240
of music-based games, and of course, DDR being at the forefront of that, and it's very cool

01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:03.720
that Konami took a chance on independent radio with this type of news, so it's very cool,

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.880
so thanks guys so much.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:10.180
And we're going to go into a song here from DDR UltraMix IV, and it's by a group called

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:14.520
Blue October, but it's not the same Blue October.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:19.140
This is Blue October UK, not the Blue October that sings that,

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:23.360
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.520
This band's a lot less emo.

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.640
They're on the different drum label.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:31.160
This is a song called Free, the Liberation Mix, and it's coming to DDR UltraMix IV.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.160
Enjoy.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.160
Blue October UK.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:49.560
This is Blue October UK, not the Blue October that sings that.

01:32:49.560 --> 01:33:06.240
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:29.040
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:55.000
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:14.360
Free, the Liberation Mix, by Blue October UK, here on Orange Lounge Radio, the last

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.200
song in our DDR sneak peeks.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:20.840
And that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.680
So did you guys like those songs?

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680
I thought it was pretty good.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.680
I liked that last one, especially.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.480
It was kind of light and airy and trance-y.

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.360
It was a little too trance-y.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.360
Yeah, you're not a big trance fan, huh?

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:33.880
You said you liked the one.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.680
What did we play in there?

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.800
The Steve Porter one.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.800
You said you liked that one.

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.800
Yes?

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.800
Dark Saga?

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:40.800
Quit taking pictures with your phone.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.800
You liked the Steve Porter one, though.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.800
Yes?

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.800
It was all right.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.800
Yeah?

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.800
All right.

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:46.800
Good times.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.320
I'm going to be starting a new feature on our website, by the way, that's going to be

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.720
my phone cam picture of the show.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.960
Oh, God.

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.960
A very unflattering picture.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:59.040
You can see me trying to, because now I'm experimenting with facial hair this week.

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.720
It's the first time in my life I've tried to grow a beard here, so it's something new.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.200
As far as the DDR sneak previews, I liked the Orifice one.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:13.680
I've actually met Zonk live, and actually, the Orifice guy is the producer for Zonk,

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.920
so yeah, I really liked the Orifice one.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.960
It was really kind of different.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.960
Yeah.

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:24.280
Now, I have to admit, the songs in the previous games weren't so hot to me, but that one I

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.280
liked.

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.520
I can see myself really playing that one, and I liked Zonk a lot.

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.960
I liked their remix of Love This Feelin' that they did previously, so I know it was kind

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.600
of a controversial song in the community.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.360
Some folks are like, why did they do that song?

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.440
But I liked it, so pretty cool.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:39.440
All right.

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.480
Well, we are going to say goodbye for now, but we'll be back in a little bit with Orange

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:49.720

little bit, but for those of you guys listening on the podcast, you have to wait a couple

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.080
days.

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.680
Sorry about that, but it's just the way we do things, and we'll be back with Part B right

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.680
after this.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.200
