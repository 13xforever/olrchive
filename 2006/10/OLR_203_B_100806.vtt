00:00.000 --> 00:29.760
If this is your first time tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, remember, or hear for the first

00:29.760 --> 00:32.980
time that our show is released in two parts every week.

00:32.980 --> 00:36.520
We tape live on Sunday nights and then split it up and release it to our podcast feed twice

00:36.520 --> 00:37.520
a week.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.560
So if you want to hear all the news we talked about in Part A, you've got to go download

00:40.560 --> 00:43.240
Part A. But now it's time for Part B, isn't it, Loki?

00:43.240 --> 00:45.040
Yes, it is.

00:45.040 --> 00:51.720
And as we mentioned in Part A, Final Fantasy XII has been pirated to the internet.

00:51.720 --> 00:56.160
Not too surprising, games have been pirated before, but it's 30 days before the game has

00:56.160 --> 00:58.760
set the release in the United States.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.000
And that's pretty interesting, that it's pirated.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.980
So anyways, the ISO's leaked to torrent sites and various news group sites, none of which

01:08.980 --> 01:21.440
I'm a member of, and it's apparently legitimate from the people that have it, not me.

01:21.440 --> 01:28.000
It's interesting, so if you should spend your money on the actual game, don't steal because

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
pirating's bad.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.840
I'll review it next week.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.960
Now wait, what I'm curious about is, you know, sometimes when albums get leaked early, like,

01:37.960 --> 01:41.400
I don't know, like didn't the Eminem, his last album, get released early?

01:41.400 --> 01:45.560
And so they had to actually bump up the street date of the CD.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.040
Do you think that might happen with this game?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.040
No.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.940
I mean, if the game's already done and in the can, what are we waiting for?

01:50.940 --> 01:51.940
Let's play it!

01:51.940 --> 01:53.660
It's a review copy.

01:53.660 --> 01:55.520
That's what got leaked, is a review copy.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.520
Ouch.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.920
Anyone else that's been leaked to the internet?

01:57.920 --> 01:58.920
What's that?

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
In the Groove 2 beta.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Really?

02:00.920 --> 02:01.920
Yeah.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.920
Hm.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.240
It's funny how you find all these things out on torrent sites and other places.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.200
Guys need to, the gaming companies need to keep a lock down on that stuff.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.560
They do, and you know what, there's no one to blame, no one to blame but themselves,

02:14.560 --> 02:17.380
because these are their copies, they get leaked out, so.

02:17.380 --> 02:18.480
What could they do to stop this?

02:18.480 --> 02:20.760
Put serial numbers on them somehow, or what?

02:20.760 --> 02:25.840
They could make them so they're only able to play on dev kits, and hope that the reviewers

02:25.840 --> 02:26.840
have dev kits.

02:26.840 --> 02:31.080
Because I mean, honestly, are you really going to have to fish for good reviews for Final

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
Fantasy XII?

02:32.080 --> 02:33.640
I mean, come on.

02:33.640 --> 02:39.720
So you could do that, watermark them, so you know, each individual copy, although I know

02:39.720 --> 02:43.800
it's going to be pretty difficult, each individual copy is watermarked so that you can check

02:43.800 --> 02:50.480
a certain, you know, byte signature or whatever and see, oh, Bill over at such and such gaming

02:50.480 --> 02:53.240
site leaked that out, I'm going to kill him!

02:53.240 --> 02:56.200
I'm going to sue him for $11 billion dollars.

02:56.200 --> 03:04.320
Exactly, so my take on this, you know, I don't know, I think, great, you get to play it three

03:04.320 --> 03:05.320
days early.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.320
Well, I think they should just release the damn game now, or don't put out your copy

03:10.320 --> 03:11.320
so far in advance.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.160
I guess maybe with so much to play through in Final Fantasy XII, that's why they did

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
it, but.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
I guess.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
I don't know.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.120
And now you know all those marketing dollars that are getting pushed for Halloween, I don't

03:20.120 --> 03:21.120
know.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.640
But just again, you know, it's publicity for them.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.600
The game will sell anyway.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
You know, either way.

03:26.600 --> 03:31.800
All right, well, we have another story here, and this is running on a site called qj.net,

03:31.800 --> 03:35.920
and they ran a story this week that says, the ESRB don't play games!

03:35.920 --> 03:40.060
And it goes like this, Aaron Ruby, the underground gaming culture spokesperson has a score to

03:40.060 --> 03:42.060
settle with the ESRB.

03:42.060 --> 03:46.140
The ESRB has been independently applying and enforcing ratings and guidelines and online

03:46.140 --> 03:48.180
privacy since 1994.

03:48.180 --> 03:52.220
The writer stated in his opinion column that the system applied to rating games should

03:52.220 --> 03:56.480
be different from those currently applied to TV and movies, which I disagree with.

03:56.480 --> 04:01.960
I think if you want parents to know what the ratings are clear as day, make them the same

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
as movies.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.760
Anyway, well, oh well.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.920
So anyway, how do they give out ratings anyway?

04:06.920 --> 04:09.080
Well, they read and watch.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.000
What happens is the game developers fill out a questionnaire on what the game's about,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.320
and the game developers submit it with footage of the most extreme scenes from the game.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.620
There are three trained raiders, not expert game players, if you check out the website

04:20.620 --> 04:24.040
you'll see this is true, from the board, and then they hand out the rating based on what

04:24.040 --> 04:27.400
they read on the form and see on the videos.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.280
So according to the writer, quote, I find it alarming that the ESRB does not bother

04:31.280 --> 04:35.600
to base its ratings on the entire experience of playing a game, instead relying far too

04:35.600 --> 04:37.760
much on submitted clips.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.360
Which is interesting because that doesn't surprise me because I remember, and I'm not

04:41.360 --> 04:46.120
going to say who this was, but I was at a conference, or I should say media show once,

04:46.120 --> 04:54.600
and I overheard a developer saying about a game that featured a lot of cleavage in it,

04:54.600 --> 04:59.600
and a lot of female stuff in it, yeah, we barely got this one by the ESRB, we showed

04:59.600 --> 05:04.360
them this and this and this clip, and I was like, that seems a little bit, and now it

05:04.360 --> 05:08.080
kind of adds up because I never really bothered to read up on how ESRB was reviewing games,

05:08.080 --> 05:11.440
shame on me, but now this kind of adds up for me as I'm kind of like, oh, they were

05:11.440 --> 05:15.760
just sending clips of maybe the little bit less scandalous stuff.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.000
But there's huge fines for lying and stuff, as the makers of Grand Theft Auto are finding

05:20.000 --> 05:23.800
out, although I still to this day say they weren't lying, they were just careless and

05:23.800 --> 05:26.440
thinking they took out a portion of the game that they didn't.

05:26.440 --> 05:30.680
And it's gotten so ridiculous now where they're, you know, rating content that doesn't exist

05:30.680 --> 05:35.240
in the game, you know, like Oblivion, you know, where they're rating it M because, yeah,

05:35.240 --> 05:40.440
underneath the virtual clothes there's virtual nipples, so, I don't know, I think it's kind

05:40.440 --> 05:45.600
of, interesting, but, alright.

05:45.600 --> 05:52.280
But some other interesting stuff, speaking of virtual nipples, Playboy, you know, they've

05:52.280 --> 05:59.080
been doing this thing for the last couple years now, releasing the Women of Video Games

05:59.080 --> 06:06.640
spread in their magazine, yes, virtual naked women to ogle over, and both Fleshbot and

06:06.640 --> 06:11.000
Kotaku have actually been running a preview picture of it, and we've got a list of the

06:11.000 --> 06:15.760
people that are going to be featured in there, as well as, well, let's see, such wonderful

06:15.760 --> 06:25.840
people, Sarah Morrison from Tabula Rasa, two of the women from the Scarface game, and we've

06:25.840 --> 06:34.760
got two women from God of War 2, and Alicia Claus from Bullet Witch, Dr. Yasmin Lin from

06:34.760 --> 06:43.560
Time Shift, and Erika from Splinter Cell Double Agent, a bunch of babes I've never heard of,

06:43.560 --> 06:49.760
yeah, a bunch of games that aren't out yet, too, I see, so, very interesting, and that's

06:49.760 --> 06:52.000
supposed to be coming out, I guess, later this year.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Did you look at the spread?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes, I did.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Nice boobies?

06:55.000 --> 07:00.100
Virtual boobies, the one chick I thought, you know, when I first looked at it, I'm like,

07:00.100 --> 07:05.160
why are they putting Blood Ring in it again, because I don't play a lot of PC games, so,

07:05.160 --> 07:09.840
I don't know, it, I guess if you're into that stuff, I don't know, I'd put this up as a

07:09.840 --> 07:10.840
pokeball.

07:10.840 --> 07:11.840
If you're into boobs?

07:11.840 --> 07:17.440
Well, if you're into this, like, you know, virtual, aren't they all fake boobs in Playboy?

07:17.440 --> 07:21.720
I mean, seriously, they're all airbrushed and everything, I mean, what's the difference?

07:21.720 --> 07:22.720
Virtual boobs or airbrushed boobs?

07:22.720 --> 07:25.600
You know what, these are probably more real than some of the pictures that are in there,

07:25.600 --> 07:32.500
so, I don't know, I guess that's cool, I don't know, very early pictures still, though, it's

07:32.500 --> 07:39.200
going to be a, they're going to have a two-page fold-out in the final version, and six pages

07:39.200 --> 07:42.000
of gaming content.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.800
How many pages of boobies?

07:43.800 --> 07:44.800
Lots of boobies.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.800
All right.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.340
I don't know, Playboy is a lot of, a lot of ads, and there's, like, not that many boobies

07:48.340 --> 07:49.340
in that magazine anymore.

07:49.340 --> 07:55.420
Will you be picking up this copy of Playboy for the articles, or for the research material?

07:55.420 --> 07:58.600
I did last year, I think.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.140
Your wife probably took it from you.

08:00.140 --> 08:02.980
I think she did.

08:02.980 --> 08:07.840
For those of you that haven't met Logie's wife, she's hilarious, that's all I can say.

08:07.840 --> 08:08.840
She's had cameos on Instagram.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.320
There was something else I was going to mention, because this was also on Fleshbot linked to

08:11.320 --> 08:12.320
the same story.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.320
Oh, dear.

08:13.320 --> 08:21.120
There is a NerdCorps 2007 calendar out starring Sherry Roberts, and there's one picture-

08:21.120 --> 08:24.280
Oh my God, my sister!

08:24.280 --> 08:26.000
That joke, sorry.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.960
Anyways, there's one picture, though, that I thought was funny, and I showed Rob this

08:29.960 --> 08:35.920
earlier, how they have her standing there naked with a power glove on, touching her

08:35.920 --> 08:38.240
ass, and I thought that was funny.

08:38.240 --> 08:43.000
So yeah, very interesting.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.280
I don't know, there's not much more I can really say about that.

08:45.280 --> 08:51.920
If you want to purchase the calendar, though, you can get it at totallynerdcorps.com, and

08:51.920 --> 08:54.960
I believe it's like 20 bucks.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.320
I don't know, I guess it's worth your dollars.

08:57.320 --> 09:02.480
I'm sorry, but I don't know, that's kind of hot.

09:02.480 --> 09:07.360
If maybe chicks wearing gaming accessories aren't your thing, do you think that's hot?

09:07.360 --> 09:08.360
I guess it could be, yeah.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.360
All right.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.360
You think your wife will think it's hot?

09:10.360 --> 09:15.480
She probably should think it's stupid, but anyways, it says it's a limited edition.

09:15.480 --> 09:23.120
They're going to have 2,500 copies, they're $25 each, features 12 months of girls with

09:23.120 --> 09:26.640
a complete daily calendar grid and all that stuff.

09:26.640 --> 09:35.840
They're pretty big, and yeah, lots of interesting pictures there.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.200
I like the cover, though, the power glove.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.400
What's up with this recent increase in erotic photography with gaming equipment?

09:42.400 --> 09:45.420
Because I've seen this on the internet, and I was on some gay site, I don't remember which

09:45.420 --> 09:49.280
one it was, but it was a gay gamer site, not gay porn.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.640
I wouldn't do that, I'm a nice guy.

09:52.640 --> 09:58.260
There was a gay gamer site that had pictures of guys covered in cartridges and nothing

09:58.260 --> 09:59.260
but cartridges.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.880
It kind of reminds me of this whole thing.

10:01.880 --> 10:07.040
The Nerdcore calendar also has, other than your typical holidays, it has nerd holidays

10:07.040 --> 10:08.040
in there.

10:08.040 --> 10:14.080
Such, for example, the International San Diego Comic Con, Anime Expo, Game Developers Conference,

10:14.080 --> 10:19.520
Talk Like a Pirate Day, Tokyo Game Show, The Transformers the Movie, Opening Day, and other

10:19.520 --> 10:22.320
flagship nerd videos.

10:22.320 --> 10:33.360
TotallyNerdcore.com is where you can purchase this calendar.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.320
I got to say, damn it, we need to get them on the show and get one of these models on

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
the show.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
Wouldn't that be awesome?

10:38.320 --> 10:46.080
Wait until we all have any model on this show.

10:46.080 --> 10:52.080
I don't know what else to say, so let's move on from boobies to violence.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.440
All the great games have either boobies or violence in them.

10:54.440 --> 10:58.680
Violence, violence, violence, this story is coming from GamePolitics.com, our friends

10:58.680 --> 10:59.680
over there.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.560
That has to do with the question and answer session with the Dean of the School of Social

11:03.560 --> 11:06.320
Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.840
His name is Richard J. Gelles.

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
And there was this interesting quote.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.900
The question was, excuse me, sir, but what is your opinion on video games and the lack

11:13.900 --> 11:17.640
of parenting to control the ever-increasing teen violence?

11:17.640 --> 11:22.560
Answer, video games play almost no important role in teen violence.

11:22.560 --> 11:27.600
Teens with a predisposition to being violent may be drawn to violent video games, but overall

11:27.600 --> 11:32.520
other factors besides television, music, or video games are more important risk factors

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
for teen violence.

11:33.520 --> 11:39.440
Again, that quote from Richard Gelles, the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice

11:39.440 --> 11:42.600
at the University of Pennsylvania, also the Director of Center for Research on Youth and

11:42.600 --> 11:43.680
Social Policy.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.280
So this guy does know what he's talking about, I guess.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.600
It makes him pretty smart now, doesn't it?

11:49.600 --> 11:54.480
Speaking of doctors and stuff, we've got one doctor who is actually defected to the PSP

11:54.480 --> 11:57.840
and that would be Dr. Kawawashima.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.960
You might know him from Brain Age.

11:59.960 --> 12:05.600
Well anyways, he's coming to a brand new game being put out called Mind Quiz coming out

12:05.600 --> 12:11.360
in November and it's actually going to be pretty much the same kind of stuff.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.400
They've got your Brain Age score and stuff like that.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.680
So imagine Brain Age minus a touch screen and on your PSP.

12:19.680 --> 12:25.920
That's kind of big news because this guy, he was doing the DS stuff and those games

12:25.920 --> 12:30.720
are huge in Japan and now he's kind of defected in a way to the PSP.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.920
I don't think Nintendo is going to slow down their big brain series any time soon, but

12:34.920 --> 12:35.920
kind of interesting.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.440
I wonder what possessed him to do that.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.920
Well, I mean, money?

12:40.920 --> 12:41.920
Maybe.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.800
There's more brain training games coming out.

12:43.800 --> 12:50.840
I know, I think Majesco has two coming out in November.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.840
Like Brain Wave, I think it was called.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.200
Now it's just going to be like all those crappy Nintendogs knockoffs we got a while

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
back.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.520
Oh God, November is the month for Nintendogs knockoffs.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.440
They've got the whole dogs, cats, hamster life, horses.

13:05.440 --> 13:10.080
Uh oh, I shudder to think what might be possible in a hamster life.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.880
Anyway, let's move on and get some feedback from you guys, the listeners.

13:14.880 --> 13:19.440
Every week we invite your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and DarkSakura is

13:19.440 --> 13:23.080
typically here to read through the email, but as you know, she's not here tonight, so

13:23.080 --> 13:36.840
I'm going to instead borrow her asbestos suit and put on the gloves and dig into our Mailbag.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.920
First thing I want to say is we got a lot of emails this week, a lot of emails, and

13:39.920 --> 13:44.200
we love reading your emails, but unfortunately we just don't have the time to read them all

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
on air.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.080
I'm going to read five of them tonight, which is a lot, but please keep them coming in and

13:49.080 --> 13:53.040
we try to respond to as many as we can get and we love reading your guys' opinions, so

13:53.040 --> 13:55.560
please don't stop just because we don't read your emails.

13:55.560 --> 13:56.560
Sorry.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.640
Alright, so this first email comes to us from Deepman.

13:59.640 --> 14:04.200
Deepman writes, Hey guys, just thinking about the new next gen consoles and had these thoughts.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
1.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.120
The cost of the Wii at $249.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.640
I think they chose to set it at this price not to make money, even though it is selling

14:10.640 --> 14:14.000
it more than it's worth, but for the simple reason that Nintendo doesn't want you to get

14:14.000 --> 14:15.360
any other console.

14:15.360 --> 14:20.440
Just think for a second, with a $150-$200 console, an Xbox 360 sounds mighty enticing

14:20.440 --> 14:26.400
to go with it, but a $250 console plus games, suddenly that extra 360 doesn't look as good.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.100
To back this up, I remember hearing a quote posted on Kotaku by Reggie that said something

14:30.100 --> 14:34.960
along the lines of, and I'm paraphrasing here, quote, I've heard of the Wii 60, but our users

14:34.960 --> 14:37.720
buy our consoles because they want a different experience.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.640
If they want something else, they can get a DS.

14:39.640 --> 14:43.080
Again, I'm paraphrasing, but it sounds like Nintendo is being smart with the pricing,

14:43.080 --> 14:44.160
if only to cut out the competition.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.960
What do you think of that?

14:45.960 --> 14:46.960
I don't know.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.760
That sounds pretty accurate.

14:49.760 --> 14:55.120
It's an interesting theory, but I don't think that was a factor in the price point they

14:55.120 --> 15:00.840
chose was because it makes the 360 sound less appealing.

15:00.840 --> 15:01.840
I don't know.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.000
I think if they could make it cheaper, I think in the long run it's which system costs which.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.040
I think your average family is only going to get one console unless they have some hardcore

15:11.040 --> 15:13.960
gamers in the house, if even that.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.840
It's a good theory, and it may be right, but I just kind of think there's a lot of other

15:17.840 --> 15:19.880
factors that come into play.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.760
Dick Mann also writes this, too.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.720
Region-free PlayStation 3, not as elaborate as the last theory, but what if the reason

15:25.720 --> 15:30.640
Sony is making the console region-free is quite simply to combat mod chippers?

15:30.640 --> 15:35.140
A strong case, and the one most used in courts, especially in Australia so far, is that people

15:35.140 --> 15:37.600
mod their systems to play import games.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.440
What if this is simply a way to nip the next-gen mod chippers in the bud before they start?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.440
What do you think of that, Loki?

15:44.440 --> 15:45.440
Could be.

15:45.440 --> 15:51.880
I think, mainly, you know the whole HDMI being added to all the different systems and stuff?

15:51.880 --> 15:56.440
I think that kind of ties in with it, because now they can do the digital flag on all the

15:56.440 --> 15:59.520
movies, and they might be able to do that with all the games now, too, if they have

15:59.520 --> 16:00.760
HDMI on there.

16:00.760 --> 16:05.000
But I guess since they do give the option not to use the HDMI, that might not be the

16:05.000 --> 16:10.480
case, but yeah, region-free, I mean, I don't see why they don't, I mean, when you think

16:10.480 --> 16:13.120
about it, because a lot of games, I mean, if you're going to import them, that's more

16:13.120 --> 16:17.760
sales for them anyways, so I don't see what the big difference is, I mean, granted you

16:17.760 --> 16:22.960
get stuff early, but it's not going to be, you know, it's only, it's not going to be

16:22.960 --> 16:26.560
translated for over here, unless it already comes in both languages anyways, which, why

16:26.560 --> 16:28.680
wouldn't you release them in both territories?

16:28.680 --> 16:32.640
Alright, there's still more email here from Deep Man, that's all I've got for now, but

16:32.640 --> 16:36.200
I want to let you guys know that my girlfriend and I went to see Play, the video game symphony,

16:36.200 --> 16:38.520
last weekend in Toronto, and it was amazing.

16:38.520 --> 16:43.200
We met Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, the guy who did the music for Shenmue and the Daytona theme,

16:43.200 --> 16:46.880
which he performed a new piano version live, and the guys who did the music for Prey and

16:46.880 --> 16:47.880
Oblivion.

16:47.880 --> 16:52.200
All I have to say is that if this comes to a town near you, guys, make sure to check

16:52.200 --> 16:55.280
them out, perhaps the most amazing show I've ever seen.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.560
And Sky, you should definitely move up to Canada, I did seven months ago and haven't

16:58.560 --> 17:02.020
been happier, keep up the good work, still listening, Deep Man.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.020
Thank you very much.

17:03.020 --> 17:08.480
As far as Canada goes, you know, it's a nice thought, I'd love to maybe retire up there,

17:08.480 --> 17:11.360
but just for right now, there's too much going on for me here in the States.

17:11.360 --> 17:16.400
But I definitely will be taking another vacation up there, probably next year, we'll see.

17:16.400 --> 17:21.480
Our next email comes to us from Malice, the artist formerly known as Stupid Baka, or so

17:21.480 --> 17:25.240
his signature says, Hello Orange Lounge, I'd just like to say before I say anything else

17:25.240 --> 17:26.240
that I really love your show.

17:26.240 --> 17:30.040
I used to be a live listener since the days of B3, that was the big DDR tournament we

17:30.040 --> 17:31.320
did in San Francisco we covered.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.280
I remember seeing you folks down at B3, which was definitely awesome.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.480
I also remember meeting Sky before a Milpitas Golf Land DDR tournament also.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.000
Those are all very good times, by the way.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.240
Unfortunately I can no longer catch the live show, but I do make sure to download the podcast

17:43.240 --> 17:44.240
off iTunes.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.160
You folks still are awesome and I really like the show.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.240
I love sitting in my room and doing my homework or talking to friends with the podcast in

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
the background.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.420
I also like your guys' quirky attitudes and witty remarks from time to time, especially

17:53.420 --> 17:55.600
those that belong to Dark Sakura and Sky.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.600
You guys make my day.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.400
In other words, Loki, sorry, you suck.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.400
Just kidding.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.160
No, thank you seriously for the words, I appreciate it.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.640
I know this is a recurring theme of discussion on the podcast and I was just wondering what

18:06.640 --> 18:07.640
you guys thought of this.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.600
I am a member of my school's mock trial team and have been since last year.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.860
This year's case is People vs. Campbell, in which a student that is being bullied allegedly

18:15.860 --> 18:18.120
created a time bomb to blow up his school.

18:18.120 --> 18:22.220
He is being charged with acts of terrorism, intent to murder, placing an offensive substance

18:22.220 --> 18:26.480
in a public place, and possessing a violent video game.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.920
All the mock trial cases have pre-trial arguments in which we argue to a judge about certain

18:30.920 --> 18:35.140
aspects of the case before it occurs, specifically in regards to evidence, the Constitution's

18:35.140 --> 18:38.140
Bill of Rights, and whether it shall be allowed during the case.

18:38.140 --> 18:41.760
The defense in this pre-trial argument will argue that video games are protected speech

18:41.760 --> 18:46.400
under the First Amendment, which is something I agree with, as do you guys, I assume.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.080
This seems to be echoed, as all the cases that they have given us that are relevant

18:50.080 --> 18:52.880
and have precedent are all in favor of the defense.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.560
This is definitely a change, as most of the cases each year, especially in pre-trial,

18:56.560 --> 19:00.540
are made so that they aren't one-sided and can be argued both ways, ensuring for an exciting

19:00.540 --> 19:04.560
trial based on how good each side is, which is why I'll most likely be on the prosecution

19:04.560 --> 19:05.560
this year.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.480
I was just wondering what you guys have to say about this, as I know that you three are

19:08.480 --> 19:11.000
very vocal and have a lot to say about this issue.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.280
Have a nice three-day weekend.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.160
Unfortunately, it's not three days for me.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.160
I have to work tomorrow, even if it is Columbus Day.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.160
Nor me.

19:17.160 --> 19:20.640
Yeah, well, lucky you guys that get it off.

19:20.640 --> 19:26.780
Anyway, I don't know much about the specific case that you're citing.

19:26.780 --> 19:31.400
Just based off of other cases, I think you pretty much said what I feel.

19:31.400 --> 19:37.320
I would agree with the fact that video games are a form of art, just like – and I'm

19:37.320 --> 19:43.080
not talking about art as in a classic sculpture you might see, but it is a form of expression.

19:43.080 --> 19:47.400
Expression is art, and it's no different than a movie or a CD.

19:47.400 --> 19:54.960
I think, therefore, it should be viewed at very similarly by the public.

19:54.960 --> 19:59.640
There are the people that criticize violent movies, and they probably do criticize violent

19:59.640 --> 20:00.640
games.

20:00.640 --> 20:06.340
But you can't say that a kid played a video game and that's what caused him to go crazy,

20:06.340 --> 20:09.560
because what about the R-rated movies he might have seen?

20:09.560 --> 20:11.940
Or what about the dirty music he might have been listening to?

20:11.940 --> 20:16.320
But more importantly, what about the parents?

20:16.320 --> 20:17.840
What about the home life?

20:17.840 --> 20:18.840
Where was the love?

20:18.840 --> 20:19.840
Where was the hug?

20:19.840 --> 20:21.800
Where was the how was your day?

20:21.800 --> 20:27.640
What's more important than the CDs, movies, or video games combined, in my opinion?

20:27.640 --> 20:28.920
Loki anything you want to add to that?

20:28.920 --> 20:33.560
No, it's basically just bad parenting.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.600
And I'm looking at chat room to see what things they're talking about there.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.360
Black Boy says, dirty music?

20:39.360 --> 20:46.320
Like Christina Aguilera's last album, Going to Get Dirty.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.520
Next email comes to us from Mr. Wonderful.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.560
Hey guys and lady.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.840
First off, thanks for putting on the show.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.760
I emailed Skye earlier, but figured that I should be thanking you all.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.360
I recently graduated college and got a great job right after graduation.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.120
It's really awesome, but it doesn't leave me a lot of time to sit around with my friends

21:02.120 --> 21:03.120
and just geek out.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.880
I've got an hour commute though, and your show really hits the spot.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.960
I still have to put on my suit and tie every day, but it's great to listen to you guys

21:08.960 --> 21:10.080
on the way to work.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.560
It's like hanging out with some very well-informed friends and talking about games.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.560
So thanks again.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
You guys rock.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.120
And Dark Sakura, don't let any haters get you down.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.520
Even a relative noob to the show like myself can tell you know what you're talking about.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.440
For Christ's sake, you mentioned the turbo duo and radiant silver gun in the same breath.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.880
If treasure shooters aren't hardcore anymore, then nothing is.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.320
I've got to agree though that you really should play Pinball Quest.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.680
Even though she's not here tonight, I'll make sure she sees that part of the email.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.280
I'm sure she will appreciate that, and I will make her play Pinball Quest.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.280
Anyway, forgive me if these questions have been asked, but I'm still making my way through

21:40.280 --> 21:41.280
the backlog.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.600
On to a few quick questions.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.760
First off, have you guys had the power to resurrect one franchise for a well-done Wii

21:46.760 --> 21:51.200
make, bringing back an old game, giving it a sequel with quality Wii functionality?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.600
What would you go for?

21:52.600 --> 21:56.440
Maybe it's just the recent re-release on GBA Talking, but I've got to think a Wii Bionic

21:56.440 --> 21:59.480
Commando would do the job pretty nicely.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.480
Thoughts?

22:00.480 --> 22:03.440
If it's 3D, maybe.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.800
What game would you like to see Wii made?

22:05.800 --> 22:12.080
Well, I know Kid Icarus is the obvious answer that most fanboys I'm sure would be foaming

22:12.080 --> 22:14.120
at the mouth for, and that would definitely be my number one answer.

22:14.120 --> 22:19.080
But as far as a GameCube game that I'd like to see on the Wii, I want to see F-Zero have

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
another shot.

22:20.080 --> 22:25.040
And I'm sure there will be some type of F-Zero on the Wii, but I really enjoyed the GameCube

22:25.040 --> 22:30.360
one, and I think it was a little bit underrated in part because the arcade version had one

22:30.360 --> 22:34.400
key flaw, and that was the fact that there was really only the one model, which was very

22:34.400 --> 22:41.200
expensive because the car moved around a lot, and the fact there was only six tracks in

22:41.200 --> 22:43.900
the arcade, and you can unlock them all in the home version.

22:43.900 --> 22:48.560
I think there was a lot to still be discovered with that concept that I think unfortunately

22:48.560 --> 22:50.880
in the execution kind of fell apart.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.920
But you know, the whole driving with the Wii stick might be kind of interesting in F-Zero

22:54.920 --> 22:55.920
or something.

22:55.920 --> 23:00.640
At least even with the slightly souped-up graphics and sound, I would like to see that

23:00.640 --> 23:05.040
and the sound coming out of the controller, I'm really looking forward to a new F-Zero

23:05.040 --> 23:06.040
game.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.040
And online, please.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.040
Anything?

23:08.040 --> 23:10.040
Loki, you can think of?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.960
It's kind of hard.

23:11.960 --> 23:15.280
I don't really know.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.280
What could we do?

23:16.280 --> 23:20.600
That would be really awesome.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.320
Let's see.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.560
Drunami says Capcom seriously needs to put Okami on the Wii.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.840
Yeah, that's not a Wii make-up.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.480
DMN says Kirby's Dream Force.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.480
That might be kind of fun, he could actually swing the ball.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.520
That was a fun game on Super Nintendo.

23:35.520 --> 23:44.000
I don't know, I'd say just remake, like make a good, even like a Castlevania would

23:44.000 --> 23:48.440
be kind of cool, a good Castlevania for 3D and make it like a first person shooter would

23:48.440 --> 23:49.440
be kind of neat.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.440
Really?

23:50.440 --> 23:51.440
I want to see him do the 2D.

23:51.440 --> 23:52.440
I got excited by the 2D news last week.

23:52.440 --> 23:59.280
Well, 2D, you can have a 2D Castlevania too, I mean, just maybe Blaster Master maybe?

23:59.280 --> 24:00.280
Now that's hot.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.240
Alright, let's go to the next email.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.920
Hey guys, it's Neodude, belated congrats on 200 and all that.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.320
I just wanted to talk about the Sonic demo on 360 for a moment and why it sucked.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.600
Oh my god, I played that actually now.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.200
What'd you think?

24:13.200 --> 24:14.200
It sucked.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.440
It was just like horrible controls.

24:16.440 --> 24:20.720
I couldn't even make it over the first jump because it was just veering off to the side

24:20.720 --> 24:23.320
when I had hit tap the button to the side.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.120
The email continues for Neodude here.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.080
The big thing was the camera sucked.

24:27.080 --> 24:30.480
Sonic has always relied on good camera control and it's not here.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.120
Plus the demo gave Sonic everything he had at the end of Sonic Adventure 2, including

24:34.120 --> 24:38.400
the bounce bracelet, which leads to many unexpected deaths, especially when you're trying to light

24:38.400 --> 24:39.640
dash in the air.

24:39.640 --> 24:43.640
If they include a window that tells you what the X button does at any time and fix the

24:43.640 --> 24:47.440
camera and maybe take out the bounce bracelet, everything else should be alright.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.440
Catch you next episode.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.800
Well, I hope they changed something.

24:50.800 --> 24:54.400
I know they've been getting negative feedback around the web and who knows, it may result

24:54.400 --> 24:57.720
in a delay of the game, I don't know, but it would be nice to see them go back and change

24:57.720 --> 24:58.720
things.

24:58.720 --> 24:59.720
We'll see.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.960
What they should do is have an option when you're running straight to be able to strafe

25:03.960 --> 25:04.960
a little bit.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.400
They need a strafe button in it.

25:06.400 --> 25:13.200
So when I'm running straight ahead, when I try to be a little off on the rings there,

25:13.200 --> 25:15.680
I'm not going to all of a sudden veer off to the side.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.840
That's what they need to fix.

25:17.840 --> 25:22.800
This last email tonight comes to us from Lazer123454321.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.960
And he writes this, Hi Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.480
I first wanted to thank you for giving the Bimani community its first podcast as well

25:29.480 --> 25:31.040
as your general game coverage.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.040
Read.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.040
You rock.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.920
I like all the politeness, like the fluffing of the egos in the first paragraph of all

25:35.920 --> 25:36.920
our letters tonight.

25:36.920 --> 25:40.360
No, seriously, we love the fact that you guys are so receptive to it.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.360
It's awesome.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.160
Second, I would like to get your in-depth view of the new DDR Supernova for PlayStation

25:45.160 --> 25:46.160
2.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.480
Just to tell about some of the experiences I've had, the new Stellar Master Mode far

25:49.480 --> 25:54.080
outshines the Dance Master Mode of DDR EX and EX2, as the majority of the unlocks can be

25:54.080 --> 25:58.120
done just by completing the first few trials in each Stellar joint and then facing the

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
showdown.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.680
I personally play Controller Controller Revolution.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.960
We call it Button Button Revolution, but that's fine.

26:03.960 --> 26:08.760
So I like to face the Diamond EX Showdown or EX Showdown in each joint.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.000
Anything you want to say additional about DDR Supernova, Loki?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.120
I haven't played it yet.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.560
I did play it a little bit.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.560
And I agree.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.440
I gave my fuller review on last week's program, so you can go back and download that in Part

26:20.440 --> 26:24.960
A. But I definitely think it's a solid entry into the series.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.080
And we'll give you lots of new songs.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.920
I like the song list, and I do agree that Stellar Master Mode is an improvement on the

26:31.920 --> 26:32.920
mode they had last year.

26:32.920 --> 26:36.200
But I didn't despise the mode they had last year so much.

26:36.200 --> 26:40.360
I felt it's okay to have the really, really hard songs kind of tricky to unlock because

26:40.360 --> 26:41.360
they're extra.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.360
They're bonus.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.000
They're supposed to take a lot of effort to unlock.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.740
But I think they did do a little bit better this time.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.740
Other questions.

26:48.740 --> 26:52.680
One, what do you think about the song list as compared to the other US releases?

26:52.680 --> 26:55.320
I think it's a pretty good song list.

26:55.320 --> 27:00.160
I do too, but Max 2 was still my favorite overall, just as an old school DDR fan.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.440
But I do think it was better than Extreme 1's song list.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.400
Two, what are some downfalls with the game?

27:07.400 --> 27:11.720
Link mode disappearing was an interesting thing that was a bit of a downfall of the

27:11.720 --> 27:14.280
game, I think.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.680
Other downfalls for the game.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.320
Oh, the fact that they got rid of a lot of the videos.

27:18.320 --> 27:23.420
I don't like the whole dancer in the custom-generated background or whatever.

27:23.420 --> 27:26.400
One thing I liked about DDR was some of the art backgrounds they had, and I always kind

27:26.400 --> 27:30.720
of looked forward to seeing some of the ones they came up with for new songs.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.720
It's kind of not there in Supernova.

27:31.720 --> 27:38.640
This is a stupid request, but the one I made before went on Extreme 2 is not being able

27:38.640 --> 27:45.760
to put in edits for the IToy stuff.

27:45.760 --> 27:49.080
You can't put in hand things on your edits.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.400
That would have been cool if you could do that.

27:50.400 --> 27:57.240
Granted, hardly anyone actually uses it, but how hard would it be to put that as an option

27:57.240 --> 27:58.240
for your edits?

27:58.240 --> 27:59.240
I don't understand.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.480
Three, what do you think about Konami bringing back Battle Mode?

28:03.480 --> 28:06.520
I think it should be more prevalent in their next release.

28:06.520 --> 28:10.880
I think they should really explore what they can do with versus mode, because I used to

28:10.880 --> 28:15.480
say this way back when the show was strictly about Bomani Games and we had the three-hour

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
show.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.800
I think the future of DDR was in a versus mode.

28:18.800 --> 28:22.960
I would like to see more competitive style play and options, so I think it's a good step

28:22.960 --> 28:28.000
in the right direction, but I'd like to see that option more fully researched in the next

28:28.000 --> 28:30.800
release of DDR and do more with it.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
Just a thought.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.440
Four, what is your opinion on the online controversy?

28:34.440 --> 28:38.540
For those that don't know, the game features a few songs that are online only.

28:38.540 --> 28:43.600
That is, you cannot play songs that are exclusive to online play in the free dance mode offline,

28:43.600 --> 28:46.300
even after having played them in the online mode.

28:46.300 --> 28:50.200
Some have speculated that when Konami shuts down Supernova online play like they did for

28:50.200 --> 28:52.960
Extreme 2, that these songs will be lost.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.480
Others believe that when this happens, Konami will reveal an unlocked code for the songs

28:56.480 --> 29:00.740
for offline play.

29:00.740 --> 29:04.160
I don't think it's the doom and gloom most people are shouting about.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.880
It's something extra.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.040
What if you have an Xbox that doesn't go online?

29:08.040 --> 29:10.160
There's many great songs that you're missing out on.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.960
Now, granted, I see the difference because you can download those songs and play them

29:13.960 --> 29:15.800
offline whenever you want.

29:15.800 --> 29:21.460
But I would speculate that if there's a Supernova 2 or whatever is next, which I would find

29:21.460 --> 29:24.480
it hard to believe there's not going to be at least one more PlayStation 2 game next

29:24.480 --> 29:29.940
year, I would bet almost anything you're going to see those five songs in the default song

29:29.940 --> 29:31.920
list for next year's game.

29:31.920 --> 29:37.900
So I don't know anything that's just speculation, but it would make sense.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.740
And then people wouldn't complain about repeats so much because they didn't really have them

29:40.740 --> 29:41.740
in the last game.

29:41.740 --> 29:47.080
What if they're just going to be unlocked at a time unlock type of thing?

29:47.080 --> 29:51.600
Like they're going to be unlocked on a certain date, say when the other games come out.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.600
I don't think they are.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.360
I seriously think they're ever going to be unlocked.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.880
I think online only is online only, and I think that's it.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.680
That's until someone puts out a code for it.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.680
That's true.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.680
Someone might hack a save.

30:03.680 --> 30:07.400
And to be honest, the content is there, so...

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
True.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
So who knows?

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
Why not?

30:10.400 --> 30:13.600
And then lastly, and finally for those involved in the StepMania community, Loki might want

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
to read this.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.760
There's a Supernova-like theme out already.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.400
It's called New Nova.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.480
It looks really good, but most of the features of Supernova cannot be replicated in StepMania

30:22.480 --> 30:23.480
at this time.

30:23.480 --> 30:31.560
Takuya's DDR Extreme, Daikatsu 88, Katsu Extreme, and K Eternal DDR Red, read K Eternal, have

30:31.560 --> 30:36.920
expressed interest in doing a Supernova theme, and Takuya will start work as soon as he has

30:36.920 --> 30:38.600
rips from the Supernova disc.

30:38.600 --> 30:42.920
I believe K Eternal is waiting for StepMania 4.0's theming engine to be finalized before

30:42.920 --> 30:44.360
he starts work.

30:44.360 --> 30:50.040
It's not that hard to rip stuff off that disc, and to be honest, it's funny how I mentioned

30:50.040 --> 30:53.600
In the Groove 2 beta had already been leaked.

30:53.600 --> 30:59.360
They've already made tools to basically reskin it, re-put songs in it for your own stuff,

30:59.360 --> 31:01.280
like they did with In the Groove 1.

31:01.280 --> 31:08.200
So, you know, it's going to be possible pretty soon just to do all that stuff pretty easy.

31:08.200 --> 31:13.160
I mean, hell, they've already automated the whole ripping of In the Groove stuff off of

31:13.160 --> 31:15.200
the disc once the game comes out.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.440
I have to be honest, I'm just not that big on playing DDR on my computer.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.440
Well, that's the thing.

31:20.440 --> 31:24.400
With the In the Groove rips that you can do in the editing, you can actually either, if

31:24.400 --> 31:28.840
you have a modded PS2, you can dump it to a disc and actually play it on the Playstation

31:28.840 --> 31:33.600
2, or if you have a hard drive like mine does, you can dump the ISO to the hard drive and

31:33.600 --> 31:38.600
play it off of that, and you can actually play your DDR on the Playstation 2.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.840
Alright, well that's going to do it for the mailbag this week, and lots of great emails

31:42.840 --> 31:43.840
this week.

31:43.840 --> 31:44.840
Again, sorry to those we didn't get to tonight.

31:44.840 --> 31:50.160
If you want to send us some email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.080
Let's go to the next story.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.280
Loki, excellent.

31:53.280 --> 31:58.920
Well, the big story this week is, well one of the big stories, Mark Raine is basically

31:58.920 --> 32:03.800
saying that the second gen game Gears of War on the 360 looks better than the first gen

32:03.800 --> 32:09.360
PS3 titles, and you know, he's sort of right on some of those, but I don't know, it's all

32:09.360 --> 32:10.360
pinning.

32:10.360 --> 32:16.920
Sony says their next generation starts when they say so, I say bullshit, and basically

32:16.920 --> 32:21.400
stating that the next gen will start when that game comes out.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.640
I don't know, whatever, big talk, but we'll see.

32:25.640 --> 32:30.040
Sounds like people just kind of whipping it out back and forth, typical PR, trying to

32:30.040 --> 32:31.600
slam the other guy type stuff.

32:31.600 --> 32:36.320
Alright, well speaking of the Xbox 360, of course when Doom came out, a lot of people

32:36.320 --> 32:38.300
were like, where's Duke Nukem?

32:38.300 --> 32:41.040
If you're going to bring us Doom, you need to bring us Duke Nukem.

32:41.040 --> 32:47.360
Well, there was an interesting post by a staff of 3D Realms, quote, you'd be surprised what

32:47.360 --> 32:48.520
they've turned down.

32:48.520 --> 32:51.840
Don't just assume MS will want it just because you like it and it's popular.

32:51.840 --> 32:56.000
Hate to sound defeatist, but it's not as easy as send it to Microsoft and get it on there.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.960
It's a rather complicated procedure and Microsoft is fairly picky about what goes on there.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.240
Sorry to sound so defeatist, but individual users won't do much of anything.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.120
Now if you could get something on the order of a million people to do the same thing,

33:06.120 --> 33:09.360
that might be different, but talking to one person like that isn't going to do anything.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.560
Besides, if you can think of it, they already have, I bet on it.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.680
Plus, as I said above, we've already talked about it ourselves, I've talked about this

33:15.680 --> 33:19.440
yesterday with George, he's all up for the idea, but we don't have the time to do the

33:19.440 --> 33:20.440
port ourselves.

33:20.440 --> 33:25.960
Plus, there's the issue of whether Microsoft would really want it.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.200
Don't just assume they would, there's a big submissions procedure to go through.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.960
Plus, their release schedule is booked solid for quite a while now, even if we delivered

33:32.960 --> 33:36.080
it to them today, I would imagine it wouldn't come out for a while anyway.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.120
Oh come on, they can release two games in one day?

33:39.120 --> 33:43.380
I have a hard time their schedule is so booked solid when things keep getting pushed back

33:43.380 --> 33:47.760
and we have to get things like the Project Gotham deck for Uno to hold us over.

33:47.760 --> 33:53.000
I mean, if they're so booked, why don't they release two games in one day?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.120
Is it going to kill the server that much?

33:55.120 --> 33:56.120
I mean, come on.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.360
Well, I think they're afraid that one game would outshine another.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.560
That's why they don't release like 10 or 15 at a time, because they want all the games

34:01.560 --> 34:02.560
to have a fair shot.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.560
Does that make sense?

34:03.560 --> 34:05.560
No, it doesn't make sense, that's stupid.

34:05.560 --> 34:11.680
I mean, the game's going to be up there anyways, so, okay, say, Dig Dug and Duke Nukem get

34:11.680 --> 34:12.680
released at the same time.

34:12.680 --> 34:16.120
Grand Dig Dug's not going to sell as well, but you know what, people will buy it later

34:16.120 --> 34:17.120
on.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.120
Who cares?

34:18.120 --> 34:22.880
Or put it up like a free game, like Totem Ball and Duke Nukem 3D.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.800
There you go, you have your free game that doesn't matter how many copies you sell on

34:26.800 --> 34:31.360
that or put out on that, and then you have Duke Nukem 3D.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.920
I don't know, I don't see what the big deal is.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.720
I think what the big deal is, they don't want to work on it because they're not fucking

34:35.720 --> 34:40.620
done with Duke Nukem Forever yet, and to be honest, just put the damn thing out.

34:40.620 --> 34:45.480
It's never going to be perfect, you're never going to finish it, the generation of hardwares

34:45.480 --> 34:49.480
is going to get better and better each time you're about done.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.160
It's never going to happen.

34:51.160 --> 34:57.440
Anyways, some other interesting stuff though, like Duke Nukem 3D, you know, had a pretty

34:57.440 --> 34:58.440
good multiplayer.

34:58.440 --> 35:02.740
Well, another game that has really good multiplayer, Lost Planet, and we will be seeing a multiplayer

35:02.740 --> 35:08.560
demo this winter, which is pretty cool, so, yeah, looking forward to that, probably in

35:08.560 --> 35:11.400
November sometime, would be my guess.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.800
You know, I wasn't that big on Lost Planet when I played it.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.080
I don't know, I'm not sure what all the hype's about.

35:17.080 --> 35:21.800
Maybe it's just not my kind of game, but maybe a multiplayer would change my mind, if I had

35:21.800 --> 35:22.800
a lot of fun with that.

35:22.800 --> 35:23.800
Yeah.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.800
Are you more excited about this game?

35:24.800 --> 35:25.800
Did you enjoy the first demo that came out?

35:25.800 --> 35:30.600
I don't like the first demo, I'm not sure if I'd buy it though, right away, I mean,

35:30.600 --> 35:35.200
I think about that time, I'm going to be busy with the Wii, so, you know, I'm not sure if

35:35.200 --> 35:37.360
I really want to buy this game right away.

35:37.360 --> 35:42.600
I mean, it was a cool game, I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks really good, just,

35:42.600 --> 35:47.560
I don't know if it, I really don't need to be buying that many games now, so.

35:47.560 --> 35:48.560
All right.

35:48.560 --> 35:55.400
Well, let's do another story here, and this one is regarding Full Auto II, is going to

35:55.400 --> 36:00.440
be releasing some PS3 online details.

36:00.440 --> 36:05.280
Apparently, the developers behind Full Auto II actually released some of the details about

36:05.280 --> 36:11.000
what online's going to be all about, and it was on this Radio PM podcast.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.720
The Full Auto II producer, Mike Gallo from Sega of America, talked about what was going

36:15.720 --> 36:21.200
on, and the OPM asked, so when you go into network play, you'll see sort of a browser,

36:21.200 --> 36:24.400
and they say, when you first turn on the machine, it logs you in automatically.

36:24.400 --> 36:28.520
I think you can change that in the settings, you have a user ID and an online profile that's

36:28.520 --> 36:32.240
set up through the PlayStation, we don't have anything to do with that, that's all done

36:32.240 --> 36:33.800
through the PlayStation network.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.280
When you log in, and as long as you have an ID and you're an active online member, when

36:37.280 --> 36:40.680
you go into the online modes, you get a menu option, you get to pick ranked or unranked

36:40.680 --> 36:45.920
play, then you'll see what games are available and then jump into one of those, kind of interesting.

36:45.920 --> 36:50.800
There's more information, as far as stat tracking, is it all within Full Auto, is that outside?

36:50.800 --> 36:54.720
When you play ranked play, your stats, pretty basic set of stats, wins, losses, will get

36:54.720 --> 36:56.320
uploaded to GameSpy.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.600
You'll be able to see, I think we have it sortable by, it's worldwide and monthly or

36:59.600 --> 37:02.260
all time, so you'll get to see who's ranked where.

37:02.260 --> 37:06.060
You'll be able to access it from our website as well, so you can look at those stats independently

37:06.060 --> 37:07.720
of the game.

37:07.720 --> 37:12.120
Mr. Big on 360, did you guys think about throwing in that concept for PS3?

37:12.120 --> 37:14.640
We actually do not have that in Full Auto 2.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.600
It's a feature we had to regrettably not support.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.760
A lot of it was just because of that moving target with the development timeline.

37:21.760 --> 37:25.780
We had to make sure our online modes and network play was solid before we added some of that

37:25.780 --> 37:26.780
other stuff.

37:26.780 --> 37:29.760
Unfortunately, that was one of the things we had to drop.

37:29.760 --> 37:33.500
Kind of interesting though, if that means that there's not really going to be achievements

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
like we know it on the 360.

37:34.500 --> 37:38.280
It's just going to be on whatever games that they want to support it on.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.840
That's kind of big news, I guess.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.440
I don't know, I guess they could patch it later.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.840
That might be kind of neat.

37:43.840 --> 37:49.800
All right, well, we're going to go now to a new segment, which is a new game.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.560
We're going to play a new game tonight, so Loki, you know I'm going to suck you into

37:52.560 --> 37:53.560
playing this game.

37:53.560 --> 37:54.560
You ready for it?

37:54.560 --> 37:55.560
Sure.

37:55.560 --> 37:56.560
All right.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.120
No, you'll like this game.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.120
Okay.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.120
All right.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.600
We thought we'd bring on a contestant of our choosing tonight.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.600
Caller, are you there?

38:04.600 --> 38:05.600
Yes, I am.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.600
Hi.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.600
Who is this?

38:07.600 --> 38:08.600
This is Bobby from Atlanta.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.280
Hi, Bobby from Atlanta.

38:10.280 --> 38:15.000
Hey, is this the same Bobby that does his own show on Sunday nights on another network?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
You know it is.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Of course.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
See now, there's a reason why I invited Bobby to be the first one to play this new game

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
here on the show.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.280
It's because there's been a little bit of smack talking in the past between Loki and

38:28.280 --> 38:34.120
Bobby and ChromeHounds, which never happened, and we're going to play each other these games,

38:34.120 --> 38:35.120
and it never really happened.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.400
No, it didn't.

38:36.400 --> 38:41.880
So I decided we here at Orange Laundry would provide an opportunity for there to be a great

38:41.880 --> 38:43.800
podcast war, if you will.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.800
Okay.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.800
All right.

38:45.800 --> 38:46.800
So are you ready, Bobby?

38:46.800 --> 38:47.800
Are you going to kick Loki's ass?

38:47.800 --> 38:48.800
Yes, I will.

38:48.800 --> 38:49.800
All right.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.800
He sounds quite confident.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.800
Two words.

38:51.800 --> 38:52.800
Shenanigans.

38:52.800 --> 38:53.800
Shenanigans.

38:53.800 --> 39:02.840
All right, well, we're going to play a brand new game, and it's called the Video Game Showdown.

39:02.840 --> 39:09.840
It's horrible music, dude.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.920
I have no reason why we're using the pressure lock theme for this, but I just wanted an

39:12.920 --> 39:16.080
excuse to use the pressure lock theme at some point during the program.

39:16.080 --> 39:21.320
All right, the Video Game Showdown is a brand new game here on Orange Laundry Radio.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.200
Here is how it's going to work.

39:23.200 --> 39:28.920
Now first things first, no fair using Google or the internet to cheat at this game, because

39:28.920 --> 39:31.880
some of you people can do your research mighty fast, so no fair.

39:31.880 --> 39:32.880
You're on your honor.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.800
Okay, Bobby, I want a fair fight.

39:34.800 --> 39:39.240
Am I allowed to at least write things down?

39:39.240 --> 39:40.480
Yes, you can write things down.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.480
That's certainly acceptable.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.480
You just can't research.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.240
You have to be on your own here.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.240
All right.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.240
So this is how it's going to work.

39:46.240 --> 39:51.480
I'm going to read you a list of ten items in a category, but only five of them actually

39:51.480 --> 39:52.520
apply.

39:52.520 --> 39:57.040
So you have to guess which five are the correct answers.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.460
Here's tonight's category.

39:58.460 --> 40:06.460
Tonight's category is, per the website video game charts, five of these games are the top

40:06.460 --> 40:13.180
five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.

40:13.180 --> 40:20.680
So tonight's topic is the top five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.680
You ready for the list?

40:22.680 --> 40:23.680
Sure.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
All right.

40:24.680 --> 40:25.680
Here we go.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.680
Here's your ten options.

40:26.680 --> 40:35.280
Animal Crossing Wild World, Brain Training, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart

40:35.280 --> 40:49.080
DS, Metroid Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris

40:49.080 --> 40:51.880
DS, and WarioWare.

40:51.880 --> 40:58.880
Again, of those ten I just named, five of them are the best-selling worldwide DS games

40:58.880 --> 40:59.880
to date.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.680
Here it is again one more time real quick, and then we'll get the answers.

41:02.680 --> 41:08.480
Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart DS, Metroid

41:08.480 --> 41:16.480
Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris DS, and WarioWare.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.080
Loki, you about ready?

41:19.080 --> 41:20.080
I am ready.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.080
You're ready?

41:21.080 --> 41:22.080
Yeah.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.080
All right.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.080
What's the five you're going to pick, Loki?

41:24.080 --> 41:31.680
The five I'm going to pick, Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario

41:31.680 --> 41:33.880
Brothers, and Nintendogs.

41:33.880 --> 41:34.880
All right.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.800
Bobby, which five are you going to pick?

41:36.800 --> 41:45.080
My five are Brain Training, Mario DS, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, and Super

41:45.080 --> 41:46.680
Mario 64.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.680
All right.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.680
There they are.

41:48.680 --> 41:52.800
Very similar list, only one difference between them, and that could be the make or break.

41:52.800 --> 41:53.800
Here's what happens.

41:53.800 --> 41:59.560
If we have a tie, and Bobby and Loki have the same amount correct, then Bobby can either

41:59.560 --> 42:03.660
change one of his own answers after I tell him how many he has right, or he can force

42:03.660 --> 42:08.080
Loki to change one of his, so that way we prevent a tie.

42:08.080 --> 42:13.400
Let's first check the correct answers and see if we have a tie tonight.

42:13.400 --> 42:17.480
It looks like we do not have a tie tonight.

42:17.480 --> 42:19.200
All right.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.080
Bobby, we'll start with you.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.440
You got four right.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.440
Four out of five right.

42:25.440 --> 42:26.440
Not bad.

42:26.440 --> 42:27.440
Brain Training is correct.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.800
Mario Kart DS is correct.

42:29.800 --> 42:33.240
New Super Mario Brothers is correct, and Nintendogs is correct.

42:33.240 --> 42:38.080
Those are four, but Loki, that bastard got all five of them right.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.080
Hell yeah.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.080
I can't believe it.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.320
I was concentrating on Japan.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.320
Did you cheat?

42:42.320 --> 42:43.320
No, I wasn't.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.280
I concentrated on thinking about what was popular in Japan.

42:46.280 --> 42:47.280
All right.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.280
That's right.

42:48.280 --> 42:52.680
The top five selling games of all time, Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New

42:52.680 --> 42:55.320
Super Mario Brothers, and Nintendogs.

42:55.320 --> 42:58.560
Because they also packed in New Super Mario Brothers... No, actually, no, they didn't.

42:58.560 --> 42:59.560
No, it wasn't a pack-in.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.560
Yeah.

43:00.560 --> 43:01.560
Well.

43:01.560 --> 43:02.560
I was a good guess from Bobby.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.560
Actually, it's a trick, though.

43:03.560 --> 43:07.480
Mario 64 was actually number six, so it was really close.

43:07.480 --> 43:10.560
My reasoning was just because it was one of the few games out when it launched.

43:10.560 --> 43:11.560
Yeah.

43:11.560 --> 43:12.560
No, it was a good guess.

43:12.560 --> 43:16.360
Animal Crossing, yeah, was kind of a surprise, but the game was really big, pretty much around

43:16.360 --> 43:17.360
the world.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.360
I mean, they're making a movie based on it.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.360
Come on.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.360
It's got to be pretty big.

43:20.360 --> 43:21.360
All right.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.120
Well, good job, Bobby.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.120
You did really good.

43:24.120 --> 43:27.480
Four out of five is not bad, and who knew that Loki had this superhuman power?

43:27.480 --> 43:28.480
I guess I should have guessed.

43:28.480 --> 43:31.840
Since he works in distribution, you probably know something about sales figures.

43:31.840 --> 43:32.840
I cry in shame.

43:32.840 --> 43:33.840
I'm sorry, Bobby.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.840
But you know what?

43:34.840 --> 43:36.600
Hey, we'll give you a chance to plug your show.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.160
Yeah, something you want to share about what's going on on the Bobby Black Wolf show this

43:39.160 --> 43:40.160
week?

43:40.160 --> 43:43.600
Well, on the Bobby Black Wolf show, we actually had an interview this week talking to the

43:43.600 --> 43:50.400
organizer of the 2006 Interactive Fiction Competition, which is basically text and video

43:50.400 --> 43:52.320
games done today.

43:52.320 --> 43:55.960
And so the art form really has progressed, and we talked to him about the competition,

43:55.960 --> 43:58.080
how you can judge, and how you can be a part of all that.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.160
So I thought it was a really interesting interview.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.160
Very cool.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.320
We haven't had an interview on this program in a long time.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.640
We need to get some interviews.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.200
How about all games as a whole?

44:05.200 --> 44:06.520
We do our show.

44:06.520 --> 44:09.000
It rebroadcasts Monday nights over on All Games.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.920
There's lots of other podcasters that get in on it, so sometimes there's tournaments

44:12.920 --> 44:14.400
of people coming together or what have you.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.240
What's new in the world of all games this week?

44:16.240 --> 44:19.480
Well, we've actually added three new affiliate radio programs.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.480
Dang!

44:20.480 --> 44:25.440
We've got – that's like a mom coming home from the adoption agency saying, we adopted

44:25.440 --> 44:26.440
triplets.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.440
No, that's great, though.

44:28.440 --> 44:29.800
We've got newbies.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.800
We adopted newbies.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.800
Who's in the family now?

44:31.800 --> 44:36.080
Well, we've got a Game Addict Hotline, which is a 20-minute podcast.

44:36.080 --> 44:39.200
It's got some trivia in it, but it's really short every week.

44:39.200 --> 44:43.760
We have Evil Avatar Radio, which is a spin-off of the Evil Avatar forums.

44:43.760 --> 44:49.280
And then we also have XBL Radio, who does the Xbox Live community chats and stuff.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.280
Oh, very cool.

44:50.280 --> 44:51.280
Well, what nights are those on?

44:51.280 --> 44:53.400
Do we have a set schedule for that yet?

44:53.400 --> 44:54.400
Yeah.

44:54.400 --> 44:58.760
XBL Radio is on Tuesday, Evil Avatar is on Wednesday, and Game Addict Hotline is on Thursday.

44:58.760 --> 44:59.760
Very nice.

44:59.760 --> 45:01.080
Well, congratulations to those guys.

45:01.080 --> 45:04.720
We're happy to see them on board, and we'll be looking forward to that over at AllGames.com.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.720
Yep.

45:05.720 --> 45:06.720
All right.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.420
Bobby, thanks so much for playing our little game tonight.

45:08.420 --> 45:12.920
And next time, I'll do a topic maybe about video games in Atlanta or something that Loki

45:12.920 --> 45:14.720
couldn't get.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.600
There wouldn't be five things in that.

45:16.600 --> 45:22.040
Wait, I thought Atlanta was one of the top five cities for gaming right under Seattle.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.040
It is.

45:23.040 --> 45:27.800
But in terms of video games being based here, I think Midnight Club 3 was here, and that's

45:27.800 --> 45:30.520
about it, unless you count sports games.

45:30.520 --> 45:31.520
Hmm.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.520
Interesting.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.400
I guess they just sell a lot there.

45:34.400 --> 45:37.880
You guys have to stay indoors, because it's so damn humid outside.

45:37.880 --> 45:38.880
It's not the heat.

45:38.880 --> 45:39.880
It's the stupidity.

45:39.880 --> 45:40.880
All right.

45:40.880 --> 45:41.880
Bobby, thanks so much for playing our game tonight.

45:41.880 --> 45:42.880
We appreciate it.

45:42.880 --> 45:43.880
Have a good one, all right?

45:43.880 --> 45:44.880
You too.

45:44.880 --> 45:45.880
All right.

45:45.880 --> 45:49.080
Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, ladies and gentlemen, from AllGames.com, does his own program over

45:49.080 --> 45:52.280
there Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

45:52.280 --> 45:56.120
A lot of our live listeners actually listen to his show as a bit of a warm-up before they

45:56.120 --> 45:57.920
come over to Orange Launch Radio, so that's pretty cool.

45:57.920 --> 45:58.920
That is pretty cool.

45:58.920 --> 45:59.920
All right.

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
Let's go back to the news.

46:00.920 --> 46:01.920
All right.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.880
We're talking about games being leaked out early and stuff.

46:04.880 --> 46:13.440
Well, this has to do with mod ship and HD loader programs out there, and, well, actually,

46:13.440 --> 46:20.040
some of the major ones were actually nailed for over $9 million recently.

46:20.040 --> 46:25.040
The ESA announced that a federal court in California ordered a group of defendants to

46:25.040 --> 46:31.840
pay over $9 million in damages for violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and

46:31.840 --> 46:40.200
the violations were against Devinio, the maker and distributor of mod ships for all consoles,

46:40.200 --> 46:48.040
French resident Max Loem, and Canadian resident Frederic Leggett for trafficking of mod ships

46:48.040 --> 46:53.320
and software circumvention device called HD loader.

46:53.320 --> 46:57.960
And yeah, it's basically, of course, the HD loader, for those who might not know, was

46:57.960 --> 47:02.840
a device that was available on the market for a while, allowing you to dump games to

47:02.840 --> 47:10.440
a hard drive built into your older PlayStation 2, whether that be one that you provide or

47:10.440 --> 47:14.280
the official Sony hard drive, and you can put games on there.

47:14.280 --> 47:15.280
I have one.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.480
I love my HD loader because it allows me to play import games.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.800
And it just loads things faster, too, on the HD loader.

47:21.800 --> 47:22.800
It does load things faster.

47:22.800 --> 47:24.400
I like not just having to switch out the disks and everything.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.400
I love it.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.880
I don't know how a bachelor pad looks around the TV.

47:27.880 --> 47:31.920
There's disks everywhere outside of their case because we're all too damn lazy to put

47:31.920 --> 47:32.920
it back in the right case.

47:32.920 --> 47:37.600
What I liked using it for is before I got my 360, when I used to take my PlayStation

47:37.600 --> 47:42.480
2 to work to play games, I didn't have to carry around like 50 disks with me.

47:42.480 --> 47:46.120
They're all dumped to my hard drive, so I can just bring my PlayStation 2 and a couple

47:46.120 --> 47:49.780
controllers and the hookups, and away I go.

47:49.780 --> 47:51.960
And plus the load times were a lot less.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.280
So in DDR, it was awesome.

47:53.280 --> 47:57.400
It was like instantly into the song.

47:57.400 --> 47:59.440
But it's gotten worse since then.

47:59.440 --> 48:04.520
Before, when I first got it, you had a cap of 120 gigs you can pretty much use now.

48:04.520 --> 48:12.000
Now it supports up to two terabyte drives that you can hook up via USB.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.080
You can literally put almost every single game out there.

48:14.080 --> 48:17.320
Yeah, but you can also go rent games and then load them on your HD loader, and then you

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
have them forever.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.160
Not that you'd know anything about that, would you, Loki?

48:21.160 --> 48:22.160
No, I wouldn't.

48:22.160 --> 48:26.240
I'm beyond renting games nowadays.

48:26.240 --> 48:34.400
Who needs the rent games when they're freely available on the internet?

48:34.400 --> 48:39.360
There is a speculation going out there that the European PlayStation 3 delay, because

48:39.360 --> 48:42.920
you know how the European folks, especially if you're a Sony fan over there, got screwed

48:42.920 --> 48:44.880
when it comes to the PlayStation 3's release.

48:44.880 --> 48:47.560
Hey, no worries, rumor is we're going to get screwed too.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.920
Everybody's going to get screwed with the PlayStation 3 release, but who knows?

48:50.920 --> 48:56.540
The speculation is that it could threaten US publishers.

48:56.540 --> 49:00.240
Just because it's releasing late in Europe doesn't mean you won't have an impact here

49:00.240 --> 49:02.880
in the United States.

49:02.880 --> 49:08.320
That's 500,000 PlayStation 3's that were expected to go to Europe at the end of this year.

49:08.320 --> 49:13.100
Now that's 500,000 less consumers to sell games to.

49:13.100 --> 49:16.280
Publishers are probably going to delay games that they previously were going to release

49:16.280 --> 49:21.000
this year to 2007 just to take advantage of the greater user base in Europe.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.040
So they'll all get screwed by this.

49:23.040 --> 49:26.240
Isn't this kind of what you were saying earlier?

49:26.240 --> 49:27.600
That's for a whole different reason.

49:27.600 --> 49:32.040
That's for the fact that they haven't gotten their dev kits in a timely manner and so they're

49:32.040 --> 49:33.520
not able to finish the game, period.

49:33.520 --> 49:40.680
No, I'm talking about earlier in the program you were talking about how sometimes, like

49:40.680 --> 49:45.120
say the Wii sells 9 million units, I think you said this in part A, then that's 9 million

49:45.120 --> 49:47.960
available systems for people to want to publish for.

49:47.960 --> 49:50.040
Is it the same logic here?

49:50.040 --> 49:52.600
In a sense, yes.

49:52.600 --> 49:57.520
But you can't really apply, like say if there's 500,000 units in the United States, that doesn't

49:57.520 --> 49:59.900
mean they're not going to release a game here.

49:59.900 --> 50:04.360
If there's no systems obviously in the UK, they're going to delay the launch of a game

50:04.360 --> 50:05.360
there.

50:05.360 --> 50:08.480
But just because Europe doesn't have their game system yet does not mean that they won't

50:08.480 --> 50:10.480
launch their US copies here first.

50:10.480 --> 50:14.140
So not only will Europe get screwed by the release of the system, but now all their games

50:14.140 --> 50:16.000
are going to be delayed six months because of this.

50:16.000 --> 50:22.840
No, they'll just come out when the PlayStation 3 launches instead of just being launched

50:22.840 --> 50:23.840
at the same time.

50:23.840 --> 50:28.440
I mean, the same thing happens with different region games, like Tomb Raider will come out

50:28.440 --> 50:30.760
in the UK first and then it will come out over here.

50:30.760 --> 50:37.380
It does not mean, for example, we can release PlayStation 3 games here first and then just

50:37.380 --> 50:39.200
wait to release them there.

50:39.200 --> 50:44.420
It doesn't matter because they need time anyways to, I guess, print more copies.

50:44.420 --> 50:49.000
One interesting thing though I have to add to this was that there was an interview with

50:49.000 --> 50:56.200
the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe World, Vice President Jamie McDonald, and he claims

50:56.200 --> 51:00.640
that Europeans don't mind that they have to wait an extra four months for the console.

51:00.640 --> 51:05.560
And they asked him, what would you say to consumers who like Sony and want to buy your

51:05.560 --> 51:11.240
product but perhaps feel because they're in Europe they will always be last in line?

51:11.240 --> 51:16.120
And he says, European consumers have shown that historically they don't mind that because

51:16.120 --> 51:20.120
they end up buying as many PlayStations, if not more, than the US and Japan.

51:20.120 --> 51:24.640
In Europe it doesn't seem that the release of our platforms after the US and Japan in

51:24.640 --> 51:27.840
the long run affects how consumers feel.

51:27.840 --> 51:33.140
I think some of our listeners over in the old country might feel a little different.

51:33.140 --> 51:36.000
I don't know guys, is it just me or do you feel a little different than what this guy

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
is saying?

51:37.000 --> 51:39.680
Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.

51:39.680 --> 51:44.040
So he's saying basically, well since Europe usually gets screwed, you know, we're kind

51:44.040 --> 51:45.040
of used to it.

51:45.040 --> 51:51.120
You know, they're assholes stretched out now, it doesn't matter if we fuck them again.

51:51.120 --> 51:54.560
That's pretty much what it comes down to.

51:54.560 --> 52:12.760
It's like kids say the darndest things, all we need now, we're just missing Bill Cosby

52:12.760 --> 52:18.400
and we've got another show all together here.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.680
I want to say this real quick before we get into the next story because there's something

52:20.680 --> 52:24.040
I wanted to talk about that for whatever reason isn't on the show roll because it was actually

52:24.040 --> 52:29.480
kind of a busy week for news with the whole GameStop conference and the systems coming

52:29.480 --> 52:30.480
out soon.

52:30.480 --> 52:36.560
There was a story, an opinion piece, does Sony need a figure like Major Nelson?

52:36.560 --> 52:43.120
Because Major Nelson is sort of like the internet guy for the Xbox 360 and in a way he's kind

52:43.120 --> 52:45.440
of a viral campaign in a way, you know what I mean?

52:45.440 --> 52:51.540
He starts Buzz on his blog and he's a popular guy, he's on the system playing the games,

52:51.540 --> 52:55.520
people have run into him on Test Drive Unlimited and stuff, and you go over to Nintendo and

52:55.520 --> 53:08.680
you have very charismatic folks like Reggie and Miyamoto, but Sony has these guys, as

53:08.680 --> 53:12.920
Jamie calls them, the crayon eaters and bike helmet, which by the way, the photoshops in

53:12.920 --> 53:16.240
our forum that you guys did, fucking hilarious.

53:16.240 --> 53:17.240
We have the best listeners.

53:17.240 --> 53:20.960
Seriously guys, if you've never visited our website, you must go to the forums just for

53:20.960 --> 53:28.520
the people doing the photoshops of the amazing crayon eaters over at Sony, it's great.

53:28.520 --> 53:32.480
Sony has these guys that make these crazy statements like this, you know, does Sony

53:32.480 --> 53:37.120
need somebody a little more hip?

53:37.120 --> 53:38.760
What they need is Willy Wonka.

53:38.760 --> 53:39.760
Why?

53:39.760 --> 53:46.200
Because it's going to take some fucking magic to sell those consoles.

53:46.200 --> 53:51.080
Some news about Oblivion on the PSP, and we knew that there's got to be some, you know,

53:51.080 --> 53:54.840
catch to this, they're not going to be able to put Oblivion that we saw on the 360 on

53:54.840 --> 53:56.900
the PSP, there's no fucking way.

53:56.900 --> 54:03.120
So what we did find out though, according to the, you know, that certain website's magazine,

54:03.120 --> 54:08.600
the official PlayStation magazine, there is actually some info regarding the game, including

54:08.600 --> 54:14.600
that it still has the create a character mode in it, but it will only have a few dungeons

54:14.600 --> 54:19.360
that you get to play in, there's no open running around and whatnot to actually play through

54:19.360 --> 54:20.360
the game.

54:20.360 --> 54:24.120
But, you know, they're going to have some, they're talking to me.

54:24.120 --> 54:27.920
Is any of it new, or are they just recycled dungeons from the existing Oblivion?

54:27.920 --> 54:28.920
No idea.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.600
If so, I mean, what the hell is the point?

54:31.600 --> 54:35.480
It reminds me of those Game Boy Mortal Kombat games, which are fucking horrible compared

54:35.480 --> 54:39.320
to the console ones, it's like, you know, we had to take out half the moves because

54:39.320 --> 54:41.240
there's only two buttons and things like that.

54:41.240 --> 54:45.840
I mean, granted the graphics for this Oblivion look kind of nice, but this is a game that

54:45.840 --> 54:50.080
should just simply be played on the big screen, or on a computer screen.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.080
Yeah, I'm...

54:51.080 --> 54:52.080
I don't know.

54:52.080 --> 54:56.920
I don't know, but I will suspend disbelief until I actually get to play, get my hands

54:56.920 --> 55:00.280
on it and actually play it, but I worry about this whole concept.

55:00.280 --> 55:03.340
I mean, at least do, why not like a little spinoff story?

55:03.340 --> 55:06.280
Do some slightly different dungeons and do like a spinoff story, I think that would be

55:06.280 --> 55:07.280
a lot more...

55:07.280 --> 55:08.280
Yeah.

55:08.280 --> 55:09.280
Well...

55:09.280 --> 55:10.280
Wantable.

55:10.280 --> 55:17.840
Yeah, it's interesting, but I don't know, the game itself looks pretty, I mean, not

55:17.840 --> 55:23.920
as good as obviously the 360 one, but I don't know, it looks okay, and like you mentioned,

55:23.920 --> 55:29.040
you know, cutting out skills and stuff, 18 of the original game's 21 skills are going

55:29.040 --> 55:33.280
to be in the game, a couple of them stripped out.

55:33.280 --> 55:37.920
I don't know, it's basically, why don't they just release like a 3D version of Diablo?

55:37.920 --> 55:42.120
It's kind of like what this game is almost like, you know, where you pick up items and

55:42.120 --> 55:43.760
just kind of grind at it.

55:43.760 --> 55:48.760
Oh, I'm sure Diablo 3 will be something we're hearing about in 2007, so that's just my thought.

55:48.760 --> 55:52.760
I swear I have not been ignoring you, chat room, over at orangelongeradio.com, click

55:52.760 --> 55:55.700
on chat, my mind just got distracted with trying to set up that game and everything

55:55.700 --> 55:59.040
a little bit ago, but it looks like Bobby Black Wolf is actually campaigning right now

55:59.040 --> 56:04.320
to be the voice of Sony, so he'll get up there and be the voice of Sony.

56:04.320 --> 56:08.160
I'll send you some Crayolas, Black Wolf, so you can start practicing, and then DMN

56:08.160 --> 56:13.560
follows up with a Nokia needs Bobby Black Wolf, you know, the N-Gage needs a spokesman

56:13.560 --> 56:14.560
too.

56:14.560 --> 56:20.200
The problem with this, I mean, I really have trouble with them pushing games like the Eye

56:20.200 --> 56:24.440
of Judgment, because it's going to take an elaborate setup to get to work, and to be

56:24.440 --> 56:30.000
honest, the Eye Toy didn't work all that great, and just a lot of the games that are

56:30.000 --> 56:33.680
coming out at launch, like Resistance, okay, it's a first person shooter that takes place

56:33.680 --> 56:38.840
during World War II, which also happens to come out at the same time as Call of Duty

56:38.840 --> 56:42.280
3, which is a first person shooter, takes place during World War II, granted one's

56:42.280 --> 56:49.000
sci-fi, I mean, whatever, okay, so that's neat, but it's got some major competition.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.040
You've got Lair, which is coming out, it's a dragon riding game, coming out also same

56:53.040 --> 56:57.280
month as Aragon, which is also a dragon riding game, also dragon garden stuff, I mean, it's

56:57.280 --> 57:05.520
a cool looking game, and then, you know, Motorstorm, which I don't even think is a launch title,

57:05.520 --> 57:09.960
I know, and then they've got all the EA Sports games, and Carbon, you know, you first pick

57:09.960 --> 57:15.640
Carbon, which is actually a pretty cool game, play the demo, and then the 2K Sports games,

57:15.640 --> 57:21.360
but like, as far as exclusive titles, I mean, there's not a whole lot, and I think that's

57:21.360 --> 57:25.600
really going to hurt them more than the fact that the console is three, you know, fucking

57:25.600 --> 57:29.760
expensive and that there's not that many units out there, I think that there's, you know,

57:29.760 --> 57:33.240
people that are like, actually going to want, I mean, there'll be people that pick up the

57:33.240 --> 57:36.960
console, but a lot of people are like, well, I'm just going to wait until some more games

57:36.960 --> 57:37.960
come out.

57:37.960 --> 57:42.800
Well, Sony fans, if you feel differently, send Loki an email, mailbag at orangeontrader.com.

57:42.800 --> 57:46.800
Meanwhile, let's move on to something for the Nintendo fans, and this is a little bit

57:46.800 --> 57:50.240
more disappointment, I mean, we already heard about the consoles are definitely going to

57:50.240 --> 57:55.520
be region locked, well, guess what, Eurogamer talked to a Nintendo UK spokesperson and they

57:55.520 --> 58:00.640
confirmed that the Wii Virtual Console games will also be region locked.

58:00.640 --> 58:05.680
The Virtual Console games will also not be universal, meaning that Eurogamers will get

58:05.680 --> 58:10.020
Euro versions of the old games, so whether or not this means certain regions will have

58:10.020 --> 58:13.960
to do without certain titles is unknown, but most likely, I mean, certain games were big

58:13.960 --> 58:15.700
in Japan that weren't big over here.

58:15.700 --> 58:19.500
The reason why I sound so depressed about this is because now I'm never going to get

58:19.500 --> 58:25.520
my MSX games here in America, unless, well, obviously emulators and stuff, but come on,

58:25.520 --> 58:30.120
I want to play the original Metal Gear, or Gardick.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.120
Metal Gear here?

58:31.120 --> 58:35.440
No, but the old school MSX, it was on the MSX before it was on the NES.

58:35.440 --> 58:41.080
Well, and the true sequel to Metal Gear was not Snake's Revenge, but the true sequel to

58:41.080 --> 58:45.680
Metal Gear was only on the MSX, but I get, well, they had the whole PlayStation 2 secret

58:45.680 --> 58:48.200
thing, but whatever, I want it on the Virtual Console.

58:48.200 --> 58:50.000
Gimme!

58:50.000 --> 58:51.480
That's why I sound depressed, sorry.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.780
I'm not too worried about it, I mean, big deal, I didn't play a lot of the import

58:54.780 --> 58:59.680
games on the NES, and whatever, I mean, it's not like they were going to put all the games

58:59.680 --> 59:04.840
on there anyways, I mean, so, you know, do I really need a Japanese version of Zelda

59:04.840 --> 59:05.840
on there?

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
No.

59:06.840 --> 59:10.680
Rama speculates maybe you can get a Japanese Wii Connect 24 account.

59:10.680 --> 59:14.960
Black Boy says he was looking forward to Doki Doki, right, Doki Doki Panic, the inspiration

59:14.960 --> 59:15.960
for Super Mario Bros. 2?

59:15.960 --> 59:19.480
Well, I mean, the consoles themselves are probably region locked, but I'm sure you

59:19.480 --> 59:22.760
could probably, like, disable it or change that to something else, you know?

59:22.760 --> 59:26.720
Well, it's very easy to get a Japanese Xbox 360 account, so maybe that same logic, but

59:26.720 --> 59:29.680
at the same time, it's hard to pay for that, you know what I mean?

59:29.680 --> 59:32.760
Like, you can't really, like, you only get the Japanese accounts, you can download their

59:32.760 --> 59:36.640
free demos and trailers, but you can't, you know, buy things on their store, really.

59:36.640 --> 59:42.680
Well, luckily, there's no real money involved, it's basically the Nintendo Points cards,

59:42.680 --> 59:45.360
or points, and you know what, you can still do that.

59:45.360 --> 59:47.600
And what if the points cards were region locked?

59:47.600 --> 59:48.600
No.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.040
Only the Amer- No, the points cards are just universal.

59:51.040 --> 59:54.640
And what's interesting, though, see, like, there is going to be some Xbox Live games

59:54.640 --> 59:57.720
that are exclusive to Japan, and I was going to buy them on my one account because you

59:57.720 --> 01:00:03.560
can actually play them on your, you know, U.S. account, too, so I would download the

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:08.000
demo on my Japanese account and register them on my U.S. account.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.400
GS68 says I want the Famicom version of Gradius 2.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.800
See, all these great games that really didn't ever come over here, and I, Nintendo, I think

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:22.560
you ought to reconsider this, or at least, if you're going to do this, please give the

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.480
U.S. gamers a shot at some of these games they never played, I bet there's, you know,

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480
money to be made there.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.160
Well, I think a lot of this, though, is going to be to eliminate confusion, I mean, if you're,

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.880
you know, a normal consumer out there, I mean, what if you don't want to download the Japanese

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.560
version of a certain game, and you might accidentally do that, and then you've wasted your money

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560
on this game?

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.200
I mean, there's no amount of clear marketing that's going to stop stupid people from, you

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.760
know, injuring themselves or downloading something they shouldn't be.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.160
All right, I'm done being emo.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.440
You know, there's not anymore you can do, but whatever.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.520
Some interesting stuff, though, Reggie over in Nintendo there is contradicting some of

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.200
the info we've gotten about the pricing for the, you know, the web browser for the Wii,

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.560
and, you know, his comments were basically, in fairness for the Americas, we haven't made

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.160
the business decision for how and what we're going to do with the browser.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.400
We recognize for most people browser is pretty standard, the concept of charging a significant

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.840
amount of Wii points to get the browser is somewhat challenging.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.760
We're going to work through that.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.400
So basically saying, you know, we haven't announced anything yet about it.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.760
I don't know why they would charge for the browser, that's kind of weird, but whatever.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.000
I mean, if it's like a buck or something, I guess you're paying for licensing maybe

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.440
for Opera, I mean, I don't know.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.200
Make it ad supported or something, I don't know.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.960
There is a third party Wiimote coming out, Pelican is making it.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:57.000
This is very interesting because, you know, the Wiimote is an expensive piece of equipment,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.120
is what, like 50 bucks, 40, 50 bucks it's retailing for?

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120
$39.99.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120
$39.99.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.840
It's very interesting that a third party is going to jump in and try to make their own

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.980
version of the Wiimote, but usually third party controllers aren't quite as good as

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:09.980
first party.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.520
For me, I kind of go, uh-oh, if I were Nintendo, I'd be concerned about this because this is

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.960
kind of like market saturation, isn't it?

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.520
Well, they're the ones that have to approve it.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.520
Well, I guess that's true.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.560
I bet it won't come out right away, that's for sure.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:27.640
I don't know, great, but I don't know.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.600
It's a little scary because a lot of the, especially the wireless controllers, you know,

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.640
they kind of suck, but whatever.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.480
Anyway, Ari Masan says, Nintendo will sue.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.320
There's some controversy now, this is about the dumbest things too, about the light on

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:49.520
the front of the Wii surrounding the disk drive, whether it's going to be on or off.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.120
During the Nintendo Fusion Tour, there's actually the light was completely turned off and some

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.720
people are like, well, hey, I want my light on, you know, what the hell?

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.040
That's my theory on this whole thing.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.000
Basically what they've come out and said, the rep, was that the light's only going to

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.600
be on when you put a disk in or when you turn the console on and that it's going to turn

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600
off later on.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.880
I think there's either going to be an option to keep it on or the fact that probably those

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.840
games that you were playing weren't running on that Wii, they were probably running on

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.160
a dev kit that was below the Wii and that the system just wasn't plugged in.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.760
Now I was going to say, when we went to the Konami thing, didn't we see Elibits, the thing

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.080
was glowing the whole time?

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.080
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.080
But of course that same logic could apply, it could have been hooked up to a dev kit,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080
doesn't mean shit.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.440
And they could have just had the console plugged in and turned on and so the light glows, but

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.800
if it's hooked, you're actually playing off of a dev kit and not the actual system.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.760
So in theory you could just, if you're limited on plugs or whatever for power, you could

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:58.000
just not plug that in and just set that there because it's just for the illusion that you're

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.600
playing with the actual Wii and not a dev kit, whereas some people, like Sony, just

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.000
like to put the rackmount servers out there for everyone to see.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.880
Alright, that makes sense.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.120
Alright, well we'll see what happens.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.640
Alright, well we are going to go now to the portion of the show where you guys get to

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.120
help out and that is by the Skype line.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.640
Just head on over to orangelauntrady.com, click on interact with us and you can learn

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.600
about how to call us here live.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.560
Our username on Skype is orangelauntrady or you can always pick up the phone and call

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.560
us, 916-226-9067.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:35.400
Can't remember if I mentioned it last week, but there is an 800 number coming soon because

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.960
the number we have now is not toll free, but by the end of the month we're going to have

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.840
a toll free number, which is very exciting.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.920
I'm very much looking forward to that.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.920
And then we'll have a lot more folks wanting to call in, I'm sure, and we'll probably bring

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.240
back voicemails of the week at that point because we think more of you guys might want

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.720
to contribute if you have a toll free number to use because most of you are just too lazy

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.720
for Skype, I guess.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720
Let's go to the phones.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.680
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.680
Who's this?

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.680
Hi, it's Rama.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.680
What's up, guys?

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.680
Hi, Rama.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.680
How you doing?

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680
What's on your mind?

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.680
Not much, not much.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.440
I'm trying to quote the last part of the show, but I just got back from another anime convention.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.600
Another anime convention?

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600
Which one this time?

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600
It's manga.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.560
It's nothing but a convention about manga and fans and stuff like that.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.560
So no video games?

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:23.240
Yes, there were video games, there were no tournaments, but let's just say older gamers

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.480
like us would have cried tears of joy at the games that were there.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.000
What did they bring?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.200
Well, we saw a working Nintendo set up with Super Mario Bros. 3.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.200
That's pretty hot.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200
Did they have Guardian Legend?

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200
No, they don't have that.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.840
They're the guys that ran the game and told them next year.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.840
All right.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.840
That works for me.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.480
Anything else you want to share about the con?

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.480
What else?

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:50.440
It was fun and it was basically drama-free because everybody just had to have a good

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.440
time.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.440
There was no...

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.760
Nobody bashing Orange Moms Radio to you this year?

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.720
No, not this year, not this year.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.920
We love our anime fans that go to the conventions and then bash us to other people.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.920
That's lovely.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920
No, I'm done.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.920
I'm just using...

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920
No one disagrees.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.920
It's cool.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920
Whatever.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.360
People have their varying opinions.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.880
There's about 500 video game podcasts out there.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.600
If you don't like this one, go find another one.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600
Just make...

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600
Keep it independent is all we ask.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.600
Definitely.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.600
Of course.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
All right.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600
Anything else you want to share?

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600
Let's talk about the games.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:30.040
There's a few Super Nintendo set up, a couple of PlayStation, and yes, there was Guitar

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.280
Hero on the big screen.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.280
There was what?

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.640
Guitar Hero on the big screen.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.320
Oh, Guitar Hero on the big screen.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320
How did that go over?

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.140
That was pretty nice.

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:45.200
That and DDR Extreme 2 were the top five.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.960
You also had Nairochimate Hero 4 and Battle Station D.O.N. are also popular.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.440
All right.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:57.080
Well, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, okay?

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.080
Excellent.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.080
All right.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.520
Have a good one and we hope for some more old school gaming goodness at the next con.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.520
Game right.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.520
All right.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.520
See you guys later.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.520
Later.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.040
Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040
Hello.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040
Yes.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040
Hey.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040
This is Al Mullet calling.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040
Hey.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040
We remember you.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.200
You haven't called into this show in a long time.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.400
How are you, Al Mullet?

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.960
I am doing just fine, Sky.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960
I'm doing just fine.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.600
Have you ever called into the podcast?

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600
I don't think so.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600
No.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.800
This is my first podcast call.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800
Your podcast debut.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.400
I know you used to listen to the three-hour show back in the day.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.540
Oh, yes.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.540
That was fun times.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.980
Now, from one of the crazy random times, no, that's great.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.980
We love our history.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.600
Now, you're getting married next week, right?

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600
Yes, I am.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600
Yes, I am.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600
Congratulations.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600
Thank you very much.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.600
Is she a gamer?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.600
Slightly.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600
I am learning her.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600
Okay.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.600
All right.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.600
That's good.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.600
There's got to be compromise in a relationship, right, Logie?

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600
Exactly.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600
Right, Logie?

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.680
We're mostly DS playing.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.000
We do New Super Mario Brothers versus.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.400
We do Tetris versus.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400
Okay.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400
Well, that's cool.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.400
That's cool.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400
What did you want to call in about tonight?

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400
What's up?

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.660
I basically wanted to say hi.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:04.660
It's been a while.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.660
It's your hand.

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:09.360
Are you still doing your column over at Inside Pulse?

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.200
Actually, hey, I have, quote, unquote, left Inside Pulse.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.920
There's just been a lot of stuff going on.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920
I see.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.560
I'm trying to find work, and obviously the marriage thing.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:27.080
I mean, things have just been, lots of stuff been going on, and I've been trying to catch

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.160
up on everything recently.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.160
I understand.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.320
Lives go through chaos sometimes.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.320
It's fully understandable.

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.000
Well, what games have you been playing recently?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.520
Did you check out DDR Supernova?

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520
Oh, yes.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.800
I've been having a blast with that game.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.800
Yeah?

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.800
There are a few songs I could have done without, but I like the setup of Stellar Master Mode.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:54.480
I really like the fact, I think it's the best, what's the word, console licenses.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.760
I think it's the best lineup thus far, especially songs like The Other Side, Turn Up the Music,

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.520
L.E.F., A Lot of Electronic Ferocious, and Shivers.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.160
Shivers is awesome.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.360
How do you think the game compares to the other PlayStation 2 releases that are out

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.360
there?

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.360
It's kind of interesting.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.040
I was just at Target the other day, and they had a DDR Supernova bundle right next to Extreme

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.200
2 bundles they still hadn't sold.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.200
Definitely options are still available to the new DDR folks that want to get on board

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.200
with this.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.640
How do you think it compares to the other ones?

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:33.480
Well, I definitely think that it's definitely on par with Extreme 2 as far as best US PS2

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480
mix.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:40.360
There's definitely stuff on there that make me go, wow, this is much better, but then

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:44.560
there are other things that make me go, hey, it was better in Extreme 2.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:51.280
I think the course mode, we got shafted with course mode this time, because there's only

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.560
one difficulty level on everything, whereas last game, you had two difficulty levels on

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560
everything.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560
Interesting.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.120
What do you think about how the new Xbox games are shaping up?

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.000
I think they're shaping up really well.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.640
Their podcasts are definitely making them more favorable by the day.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.680
I appreciate that, and I'll let Konami know you said that.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.600
No, seriously though, if you were still reviewing games for the website, how many stars out

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.480
of ten would you be given DDR Supernova?

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.000
DDR Supernova, well, that would be under the ten category review system.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:33.200
I gave Extreme 2 a 7.5, and said that was the best one ever, which is like a 9.0 on

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.160
other websites.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:43.840
I would say that Supernova would range between a 7.0, 7.5, because there's stuff that's better

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.720
and there's stuff that's worse, so it would be around the same score, I would think.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.720
What's up with that?

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.760
You brought up an interesting point, is that a 7.5, the way you would review games, and

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.600
if I wrote game reviews, I would hope I would be very similar as well, where an average

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.320
game gets an average score in the middle.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.880
But it seems like most game websites, you're right, kind of skew it towards the high end.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.440
Here's what I would get.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:16.040
For example, games that are reviewed on IGN, they'll have a score for each category, and

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.320
the score doesn't have anything to do with any category on there.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:25.560
So for example, a game might score 7.5s across the board on all the other categories and

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.400
get a 6 overall.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.160
Like okay, how the hell does that average out?

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.680
Or I'm thinking about Rotten Tomatoes, because they cover game reviews, they don't do it

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.400
quite as well as they do movies, but it says we only give a fresh rating if the site gave

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:44.240
it a 7 or better, because of the skewed people tend to give higher scores on game reviews.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.400
Why do you think that is, Emily?

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.880
The problem is that so many of these numbers are pulled directly out of their asses, and

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.400
most of these numbers don't even correspond to what their written opinions are on the

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.400
game.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:03.160
There are 7.0s on some sites and on some game reviews, and the bottom line is don't play

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.160
this.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.600
It's the way that Inside Pulse reviews games.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:15.960
It's out of a 10-category system, and it could really excel in some areas, but there are

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.000
other areas that could bring the game down.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.080
A game could have a great story, but horrible graphics and sound.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.360
The game could have great gameplay mechanics, but it could only be fun for the first three

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:35.080
hours and basically the games have to be really awesome in all categories to get 8 and above,

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.080
but a game can be worth playing at a 7 or even a 6.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.240
Alright, yeah, that's true.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:48.200
I was going to say, I hope to see that you come back to the internet soon reviewing games

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:53.360
and sticking to the more realistic scale that you started over there.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.640
You just might see a Supernova review before the end of the week, assuming I have enough

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.640
time.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640
Very cool.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.640
Well, El Mullet, I've got to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.940
so much for calling in.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:03.940
Thank you.

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:04.940
Have a good one, buddy.

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:05.940
You too.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.940
Alright, bye-bye.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:07.940
Bye.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.280
How exciting, a wedding, getting married and all that fun stuff.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.280
Let's go to another call.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.800
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800
Who's this?

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.800
Ultimate Gamer from chat.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.520
Well, I'm currently not in chat right now.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.000
Alright, well hello Ultimate Gamer.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:31.520
Yeah, I'm just thinking about the Xbox 360 and now it has a $200 HD DVD drive, and am

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.120
I just going to have to... Should I just get a PS3?

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:46.600
Because since the Blu-ray drive is implemented into the PS3 and games are actually on Blu-ray

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600
discs.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600
Gotcha.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.600
Okay, I see.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.600
Here's the thing, though.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.920
Are you interested in just playing movies with this device, or are you going to be playing

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.040
games as well?

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:04.360
I mean, I'm mostly getting the PS3 for games, but I know the Xbox 360 has some good games.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360
Right.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.260
Because the PS3s are actually on Blu-ray discs.

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:13.600
I think it really boils down to which console has the games that you want, and Microsoft

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.400
gets a lot of heat usually because they overlook, or at least they have in the past, they don't

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.280
have a lot of solid role-playing type games.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.020
They don't have a lot of solid action games, and they've been trying to correct that.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.400
You've got Blue Dragon coming out, and they had Cameo.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.860
Take that for whatever it's worth, but Sony's always excelled in that range, but on the

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:37.840
flip side, Sony doesn't seem to have a strong lineup right now, so you have to look more

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.900
into the future at what Sony's got, and Microsoft is trying to correct themselves, and you saw

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.320
that with Tokyo Game Show.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.260
They're trying to take a more broad approach to different games, so you really have to

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:51.640
ask yourself, which of these two systems is going to have the games I want to play?

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.040
Because remember what we always say, the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.480
the games that are on it, and when it comes down to the whole, I guess here's another

01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.780
question I have for you.

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.560
Where does the Wii stand in your mind?

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.880
Do you not care about the Wii?

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.880
Heck no.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.520
I mean, the Wii is one of them.

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.440
I'm definitely going to get the Wii at launch.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.840
Right, but the thing is, the Wii doesn't have any of that, and the Wiis not have a Blu-ray

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840
player.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.220
Hell, it doesn't even have a DVD player.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.160
So that system is really about the games.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.320
You are buying that system for the games and the games only.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.560
So I would say take that same logic and put it on Xbox 360 versus Playstation 3, because

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.120
it's not really going to matter Blu-ray, HD, DVD, whatever.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.760
It's going to be really about the games in the end.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.760
I'm going to be honest.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.160
I've seen Blu-ray and HD DVD side-by-side.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.340
It's really not that much different.

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:39.240
The spec-wise, they're about the same too, other than data.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.480
But I do understand what you're saying is that Sony, and I do agree this could be to

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.960
their advantage in three years, is that Sony has the native Blu-ray support for the games,

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.880
and while right now it's causing the system to cost your first-born child, later on, when

01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.700
we get further down within the subdivisions of this generation, that could really benefit

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:01.700
them in the end.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:06.960
But I don't know, for me, I'm kind of like, well then I'll buy the PS3 when it's got those

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960
games.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:14.160
Well, what I'm saying is with the Blu-ray disc, it's going to actually be a high-definition

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.920
disc, whereas the Xbox 360, it's just like having an HDTV will make the game high-definition.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920
True.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:21.920
That's true.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.660
But also, don't forget, the other part I'm trying to say here is that doesn't it boil

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:28.760
down to how good the games are, though?

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.920
Not necessarily how they look, because being on Blu-ray, certainly they're going to look

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920
better.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.020
But if you're going to buy a Wii, then you must already be into that school of thought

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.400
that it really is about the fun games.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.400
And granted that Blu-ray does have more storage available to it, doesn't mean, though, that

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.480
they'll use it all, and also doesn't mean that the games that are on DVD-9s are going

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.300
to look any less brilliant than, say, a PlayStation 3 game.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.040
Look at Gears of War and Resistance, perfect example.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.760
They both look very good, and one's on DVD, one's on Blu-ray.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.240
It's just compression technology and whatnot.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.920
Don't shop based on specs, shop on what games are good, what you're looking for to get out

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:14.040
of the system, because if you shop on specs, it's just going to be ridiculous.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.120
Here's my closing thought for you, I suppose, Ultimate Gamer.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:23.200
After all, your name is Ultimate Gamer, get a second job and buy them both.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.320
I'm just messing with you, but I know you're probably right now.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.840
You want one this year, and maybe you'll get the other one next year?

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.720
Probably I know I'm getting the Wii first.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:42.440
The PS3, I get a couple months down the road, but I think the games, they should be like

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.160
fully enough, but also good graphics.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.160
You know what?

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.160
I think you're on the right track, then.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.760
If the Wii is, it sounds like you really, really, really want the Wii, then go for that,

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.640
buy that, and then when you have enough money saved up for a second console, look at the

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:00.080
games that are out and or coming out and make your decision at that time.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.440
Yeah, all right.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440
All right.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.440
Thanks, really love the show, and a great RSS feed.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:10.000
I listen to it on my PSP every week, and I get no buffering signs or anything.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Love it.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.560
I'm glad to hear there's people still using OLRPSP.com, so, Loki, go update it.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560
It's all right.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560
Thank you.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560
We appreciate it.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:23.160
I know sometimes we give the PSP a hard time on this show, but it is a great multimedia

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.160
multi-platform system, and we're really glad to be able to offer our podcast on it.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.160
All right.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.160
All right, have a good one, buddy.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.160
Bye-bye.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.160
All right, bye-bye.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.160
Bye-bye.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.160
That was a good call.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.160
All right.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160
Let's go to another call here.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160
All right.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160
Hi.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.160
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.160
Who's this?

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.160
Am I on?

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.160
Yes, you are.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.160
Sorry about that.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.160
It's Legend of Zaku.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.160
Hi, buddy.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160
What's on your mind?

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.160
Digitalize next week.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.160
I know it is, and I'm not going.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160
I'm missing it by a week.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160
Wait.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160
Wasn't it this week?

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.160
No.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160
It's this weekend.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.160
Oh, gotcha.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.160
Okay.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.160
I just, you know.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:06.280
Yeah, I'm missing it by one week.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.280
I know.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.080
I should be able to dig you up some information on whatever you like.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080
We want to hear it all.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.880
We want to hear from all the New York listeners next week that are going to this.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.840
Yeah, I will report back since I'm competing.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.840
All right.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.840
So, great.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.840
It's all next week.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.840
What do you want to talk about now?

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:28.080
Well, basically, I mean Nintendo's doing a lot of good things with the Wii, but then

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.160
all the good things end up turning up sour, you know, when you really think about it.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.160
The whole having to lock down, you know, region, regioning on, you know, the games and the

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.160
virtual console.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.960
Isn't that going to hurt them in the long run?

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:47.160
Well, I agree it sucks and all, but you know, the NES was region locked too.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.800
Yeah, but that was easy to get, you know.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.000
It wasn't as, that was then.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.320
I mean, when you have the PS3 being region free, couldn't they just compete on that?

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.840
I don't, I got to be honest with you.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:07.060
I know the folks that listen to this show because the way myself, Loki, and Dark Soccer

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:12.040
are is that we are focused a lot on import gaming and we really do enjoy a lot of the

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.680
games that come over here from Japan.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.760
So from our perspective, yeah, it's really fucked up that Nintendo's not supporting the

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.760
region.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:23.360
I mean, if you had, if you had like a single version of a game without having to do any,

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:29.760
you know, any, any porting, any extra work and try to localize it to a particular country,

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.200
you know, rather, you know, rather doing the languages the first time, wouldn't that make

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.840
more sense than just releasing one copy?

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.020
Well, that's a lot of work though, because you have to do all those different languages

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.020
and things.

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:46.400
I mean, if you have French for parts of Canada, Japanese, but that's, you know, but just keeping

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.520
that in the single source.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.920
Maybe but, but here's, okay.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:59.920
Here's my other question for you would be then about the Wii, what, what's the, okay,

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:04.280
what about the, the greater gamer culture out there besides just us, the rabid, you

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.280
know, import gamers?

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.280
Are they going to give a shit?

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.280
Yeah, casual gamers won't give a crap about, about what we're bitching about.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.640
I mean, that's a, that's a fact.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:19.640
Casual gamers just want to play, period, and so what the Wii does is gives them that opportunity

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.440
to just play, which is basically Nintendo's banking on right now.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:27.780
They're just banking on the, on the casual gamers to, to pretty much, you know, dominate

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:28.940
this holiday season.

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.340
So my question is in the big picture, will it really make a difference that they've region

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:33.720
locked out?

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720
Not really.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.880
It would affect some, but then Nintendo wouldn't care because that, because our, our niche

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.160
minority is not their bottom line.

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:47.520
Their bottom line is about everyone, the casual gamer included.

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.840
Interesting comment in our chat room, Ari Masin says, I'm a large importer.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.320
I might buy two Wiis just to play both Japanese and American games.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.400
Well, Nintendo just one off you.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.920
Well, that's basically what people did when the PS2 first came out.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:00.920
Yeah, that's what I did.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.840
Hey, Sony made it twice off me, so whatever.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.800
And you know, who knows?

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:09.320
There might be a way to just crack the Wii like they did with the GameCube to play imports.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.320
Oh, we'll see.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.360
And so you got to get those technologies, you got to give those opportunities time.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360
All right.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.120
All right, Zach, who, anything, any of the thoughts for our listeners?

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.680
Basically New York people, Digital Life this Friday, Saturday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.680
Sunday.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.280
Who's, where's a good meetup spot at Digital Life?

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.880
Basically I'm not really sure.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.320
Maybe maybe in the front lobby of the Javits Center.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320
All right.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.800
So maybe on the, or maybe inside the DDR machine, maybe in the DDR tournament area.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.800
All right.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.040
Orange Loungers, Orange Loungers, be at the DDR machine Saturday at noon.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.040
Mm-hmm.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.520
All right.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.520
The OLR meetup.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:51.280
Yes, the OLR meetup right there with the DDR tournament.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.280
All right.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280
It's Saturday at noon.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280
All right.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.280
Have fun.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.280
Be there.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.280
Okay.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.280
All right.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.280
Later, Zachu.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.280
Bye.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.280
Bye-bye.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.280
One more call.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.280
Last call.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.280
Who's this?

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.280
It's DMA.

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.280
How's it going, guys?

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.280
God damn, you get through every week.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.280
You know?

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.280
All right.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.280
Well, what's up, DMN?

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.520
I'm actually calling with a, well, now having heard that last call, I have something else.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.800
But the first thing is a little brief review of Clubhouse Games for the DS.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.080
I want Clubhouse Games.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.600
I totally forgot about this game until somebody was talking about it in chat earlier.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.360
Dude, the only reason I want to get this game is because you can pick the chat over the

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360
internet.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360
No, no, you can't.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.360
Oh, fuck.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360
That's it.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.360
I'm not buying it.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.960
Fucking Nintendo, that's what you get.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.480
You can pick the chat over local Wi-Fi while you're playing.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.760
Well, I can do that already.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.600
You can't do pick the chat while you're playing a game, though.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.680
I can do it while I'm playing ping-pals.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.240
Well, I'm sorry you bought that.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.880
No, it was a gift.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.680
It was a very nice gift.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.680
But fuck that game.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.680
Seriously.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.680
I'm sorry.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.680
I'm sorry that I was bought for you.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:55.680
That's like, no, no, no.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.600
I mean, it was a very sweet person that gave it to me.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.020
I'm not saying anything negative about the game, but seriously, it was like getting a

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:03.760
fruitcake for Christmas, okay?

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.400
You know grandma loves you, but you got a damn fruitcake.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.240
Yeah, well, Clubhouse Games is really cool.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.360
What's really awesome about it is with the Wi-Fi mode, you can play all of the multiplayer

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.800
games online, which is like about 36, I think, when I come to it.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.800
Now, see, that's cool to me.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.080
Yeah, and it's great because I'm a casual gamer as well as a hardcore gamer.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.320
I love playing like checkers, chess, whatever.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.160
So this is fun for me because I can play with my friends all around the world, and at the

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.520
same time, it's games I know how to play.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.520
Cool.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.400
Now, what other kind of like features does this have kind of souped up with the games?

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.960
You know, there's like 30 some odd games, which I suppose is a big selling point, but

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.200
what are some other features that might sell this game to people?

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.920
The fact that it's under the Touch Generations label, which is Nintendo's label for games

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.800
anyone can pick up and play.

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.460
So you could, sorry, lost some thought there.

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:05.840
You could pick up anything on this and immediately want to play it, and from what I hear, it

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840
might be affordable.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.440
I hear it might retail at the very most expensive $29.99.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.440
Interesting.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.880
Loki, do you know how much that's retailing for?

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:14.880
What thing?

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880
Clubhouse games?

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880
Do you know how much that's going for?

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.320
Things like, I want to say $19.99 or something.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.320
Oh, okay.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.320
That'd be nice.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.320
That's a really good deal if that's true.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.640
I can't remember off the top of my head.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.000
If you give me a second, I can check.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.800
All right, well, you do that.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.160
What else did you want to say, DMN, while he's checking?

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.480
Now hearing about that whole Wii region lock, it could be very possible that sometime down

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:41.800
the road, Nintendo could release a firmware update to eliminate that issue.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.240
Why would they do that?

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.360
I don't know.

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.360
Perhaps maybe Nintendo will realize the error of their way sometime down the road and be

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.240
like, oh, hey, these people want to play our Japanese titles.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:26:01.120
They can't ignore the fact that Owen Don was one of the most imported games of 2006.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.240
And they said, okay, fine, we're going to give you Elite Beat Agents.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:11.000
But if there's an Owen Don game coming out for the Wii, I want it, and I don't want to

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.960
have to buy another Wii or crack my Wii open to play on my American console.

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:19.360
I totally understand what you're saying, because it's as cool as Elite Beat Agents might be,

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.540
it's not Owen Don.

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:27.640
It's not the same song list, which in a music game is everything.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.840
And that's what Dark Tetsuya agrees in chat right there, but Elite Beat Agents is an entirely

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.840
different game.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.240
Did you find the answer, Logie?

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.240
Yes I did.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.240
What?

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.240
$29.99.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.240
Blast.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.240
That's all right.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.520
$29 is not a bad price, really, for that many games.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.640
But I mean, they're not all shitty clones of each other, right?

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.640
They're all uniquely different, pretty cool games?

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.160
Yeah, they're all uniquely different, and I've already played a couple games of Wi-Fi.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:58.720
There is nothing like a good Wi-Fi game of BS, and definitely nothing like a good Wi-Fi

01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.720
game of Speed.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.720
If anybody's familiar with that game.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.520
I'm totally going to be playing some of our chatters in Speed.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.180
I'll buy this game just for that.

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.860
You could have just released Speed and I'd buy that.

01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.860
That's a great game.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:08.860
All right.

01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:12.840
Well, I'll be picking up the game, and we'll post on the forums and get an OLR get together

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.480
on the clubhouse games at some point.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480
All right, cool.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.480
All right.

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.480
DMN, thanks so much for calling in.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.480
We appreciate it.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.480
All right.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.480
Take care.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.480
Have a wonderful week.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.480
Bye-bye.

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.480
All right.

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.480
That's going to do it for the Skyline tonight.

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.480
Thank you guys so much for calling in.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.480
Sorry to those folks who didn't get through.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.480
Try again next time.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.480
Any last minute stories you want to share, Loki?

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.480
Of course I do.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.480
I know.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480
You always do.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480
Anyways.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.480
Some wonderful stuff.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480
Okay.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.200
One thing about the Wii, since we were just talking about it.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.160
The Miis that you create, actually, they're going to be popping up in different things.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.960
For example, in games, you might see the other Miis that you've created in the audience or

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.120
in the stands for certain games.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:55.120
Also, they will be possibly migrating to other Wii systems, kind of like Animal Crossing.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.120
So that's kind of neat.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.120
Oh, that's kind of neat.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.120
Yeah.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.040
So it's not just your face in Wii Sports.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.240
It's the tennis wielder.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.240
You might start infecting other consoles.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.240
That's kind of neat.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.240
Exactly.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.240
All right.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.240
I like that.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.240
So that's pretty cool.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.240
Some other cool stuff.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.680
Rainbow Six Vegas is going to be seeing a demo on Xbox Live on October 23rd.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.960
That game looked pretty amazing.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.600
So worth checking out.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.560
As we mentioned before with GT, that it was going to have a steering wheel attachment

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.680
for the Wii.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.760
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, another Ubisoft racing game, will also have that same steering

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.360
wheel attachment as well for the Wii.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.400
So that's going to be pretty cool.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.640
Something that I thought was kind of interesting, well, actually, a few acquisitions took place

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.640
this week.

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:48.080
EA finished their deal to buy DICE, the makers of Battlefield franchise.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.520
So that was pretty interesting.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.600
And also, Foundation 9 acquired Shiny Entertainment.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.140
You might remember them from wonderful games like Earthworm Jim.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:04.560
And then there was a survey that went out for Guitar Hero that mentioned two games that

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.080
are possibly in the works, Keyboard Hero and Drummer Hero.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:13.920
In no way, I'm sure, ripping off any Konami franchises with those.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.800
But interesting nonetheless.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.640
Oh yeah, I heard about that survey that went out.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.280
I don't know, though.

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.920
I think people might be reading too much into that whole thing.

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:32.240
There was also a really cool product that was released called Connect360 that indexes

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.880
your iTunes and iPhoto libraries to stream them to the 360, which is interesting.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:46.760
If you want to check that out, it's www.nullriver.com slash index slash products slash Connect360.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.680
So go check that out.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:53.480
And then some more adult content that is available out there.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:30:00.080
For Dead or Alive Extreme 2, you will be getting changing sequences.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.080
That's right, the girls will change.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.280
Like in Final Fantasy X-2, where they did the little woo!

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.280
Actually yes.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.680
I knew it.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.680
It's not like...

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:14.840
It says it will be anime-inspired, resembling a transformation sequence you'd find in something

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.120
like Sailor Moon.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:20.520
Of course, there's going to be some really naughty stuff in there.

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:28.200
And then finally, to all-out actual porno, the Whores of Warcraft, a website that's actually

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:35.720
released that has Warcraft-themed porn on it, and that's Whores of Warcraft dot com.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:43.360
They have one episode you can purchase right now for $7.95, and it's real people.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:47.480
This isn't Maki-Mai or anything like that, but they actually also have a MySpace community

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:52.080
if you want to join that, which is MySpace dot com slash Whores of Warcraft.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.560
I should also mention that Orange Lounge Radio has a MySpace community that's more worth

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.560
your time.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.560
MySpace dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.360
But they have some chick that looks like she has elf ears, so that's kind of interesting.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:06.800
That's your elf porn going on there.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:14.520
I have received a hot tip from a trusted source that WarioWare for the Wii is going to be

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:18.240
bumped up to a launch title, and you will be seeing that very soon.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.800
Well good, because I have that pre-ordered, and it was only slated for January.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:29.120
Well, it looks like you may actually get your WarioWare on in November, so take that as

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.120
you will.

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:35.600
I want to see Wii Play come out as the launch title, too.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.880
That's not even slated to come out in this country at all, is it?

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.800
It's coming out in the UK, I mean, come on!

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:45.640
How hard would it be to release it here as well, I mean, seriously.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.320
That's going to wrap it up for tonight's show.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320
We're done.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.520
We're out of here.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:53.080
This is a weird show with just two of us, but we did pretty good getting through all

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.080
the news.

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.560
Dark Soccer will be back next week to keep us in line and to read the emails and give

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:02.360
you her website of the week, of which there is none this week because she's not here.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:06.800
Next week as well, we'll have more of you guys in our chat room and on the Skype line

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.040
and more news and hopefully some interviews.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.320
We are trying to get some interviews lined up for the rest of the month on through the

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320
year.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
We appreciate it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.400
Well, Loki, your final thought?

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.760
My final thought is I have two episodes of my new show done already, both an hour long.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.760
Excellent.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.760
Yes.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.000
Orange House Radio will be participating in November sweeps this year.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.480
That's all I can say.

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:38.280
My final thought will be, on behalf of Jamie not being here, I will say reject false icons.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.960
My other final thought would be how in the hell did six bottles of Aquafina end up over

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:43.960
on Extra First's desk?

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.160
That's kind of scary.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160
They're all half empty.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:48.720
Actually, quite a bit of them are mostly full.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720
What the hell?

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.720
What the hell is wrong with this picture?

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.720
Such a waster.

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.840
Oyster of water.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:57.760
All those countries out there that are dehydrated.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.400
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.400
We appreciate it.
