0	19920	Tonight, October 1, 2006, Microsoft dropped some surprises at X06.
19920	23200	Other uses for your Microsoft points besides Microsoft Arcade.
23200	32560	And will Next Gen Castlevania go back to its roots?
32560	36680	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36680	37680	Radio.
37680	42360	We are that podcast dedicated to video gaming and gamer culture and the gamer news that
42360	46160	you guys really want to know about, at least the stuff we think you want to know about.
46160	47320	I'm here to help you through that.
47320	48320	My name is Rob Roberts.
48320	49600	You might know me as Sky.
49600	53920	Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53920	54920	Yo, what up?
54920	55920	How you doing?
55920	56920	I'm a little worn out.
56920	57920	A little worn out?
57920	58920	Long day?
58920	59920	I had a busy weekend.
59920	60920	I had a busy weekend too.
60920	61920	It's been crazy.
61920	62920	Yeah.
62920	64680	One of my really, really, really good friends in the whole wide world had his birthday this
64680	65880	weekend, so we were running around.
65880	71480	I wanted to go, but I had already made plans to be in the bay since my hubbies at GameStop
71480	72480	conference.
72480	73480	That's okay.
73480	74480	He was too drunk to remain.
74480	76040	You probably could tell him that you were there and he would remember.
76040	78080	Oh yeah, I was sitting right next to you.
78080	79080	Exactly.
79080	80080	I had a beer.
80080	82200	And just go, you know, you were so drunk.
82200	83200	Oh my God.
83200	84200	Exactly.
84200	85200	All right.
85200	87520	Say hello to the sober for now, Loki.
87520	88520	Hello.
88520	89520	No, just kidding.
89520	94360	Tonight is not a drunk episode and we're being very responsible adults tonight, right, Techmaster
94360	95360	Loki?
95360	96360	Sure.
96360	97360	All right.
97360	98840	Maybe he is drunk and he just didn't say anything.
98840	99840	I don't know.
99840	100840	All right.
100840	104440	Well, we like to always start it off talking about our gaming weeks, so let's get right
104440	105440	into it.
105440	106440	Let's cut the crap and talk games.
106440	108480	Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week?
108480	113080	I played DDR on Tuesday, just, you know, extreme.
113080	117440	I wanted to go play Supernova, but I don't know how to really get to anywhere in Rockland,
117440	124760	so I just sort of went to Arviggle for the first time in like a year and there was...
124760	128600	We decided to name the Flock of Emo that came in.
128600	129600	There was...
129600	130600	Flock of Emo.
130600	131600	Was that an 80s band?
131600	132600	No, that was a Flock of Seagulls.
132600	133600	Oh yes.
133600	134600	All right.
134600	135600	Flock of Emo is trademarked Megsy.
135600	138480	So one of them was the definite emo kid.
138480	139840	There was the punk girl.
139840	146600	There was the token normal friend, you know, the kind of nerdy person.
146600	147600	Were they all playing DDR?
147600	148600	They were all playing DDR.
148600	149600	Oh wow.
149600	157880	And so I was there with my friend Heather, who's on my LiveJournal, and we had fun.
157880	161640	Speaking of emo, meeting people from LiveJournal, huh?
161640	166200	I had been friends with her through LiveJournal for I guess a year or so, and she's friends
166200	168200	with my cousins-in-law.
168200	172200	She actually hangs out with them regularly, so we just figured let's finally just go hang
172200	173200	out.
173200	174200	So we did.
174200	175200	Cool.
175200	177820	And then we...
177820	178820	I went to...
178820	179820	Oh crap.
179820	181840	I lost my chair, I thought.
181840	182840	Okay.
182840	183840	My friend Tiara.
183840	187120	You all know Tiara, my sauce.
187120	192120	She introduced me to a game called Pirate King Online that's a new MMO.
192120	198880	Right now it's in open beta, and it's cute, and you go around killing things and questing
198880	201560	and getting clothes and making pie.
201560	202840	Oh, that's a different game.
202840	208200	I'm sorry, I was familiar with the other Pirate King, which game I participate on a regular
208200	209200	basis.
209200	212840	Is that like a website where you download pirated files or something?
212840	213840	No, I just...
213840	215920	Oh, you know, I am the Pirate King.
215920	230320	Anyway, and then I spent this entire weekend in the Bay Area with, everyone knows Kristen
230320	231320	by now.
231320	233000	Yeah, she's been on a couple times.
233000	237600	Yeah, she was too tired to come on the show today.
237600	243400	We went to the Castro Street Fair, and it was just so busy and so many people that it
243400	249160	was just like, I'm tired, I'm tired too, let's go get some hot chocolate, okay?
249160	253560	So I really didn't play anything else.
253560	256840	Hmm, interesting.
256840	261240	I played quite a bit this week, and nothing I really, well, there was a bunch of stuff
261240	264040	I had lined up to play, but I never got around to.
264040	268200	You know, the whole hooking up the PlayStation 2 again thing.
268200	274800	I did get to play, well first off, my camera, I replaced the vision camera, and yes it was
274800	277720	defective, got the new one, works great.
277720	280040	So now do you feel bad about bashing the camera last week?
280040	283760	No, I don't, but it's good when it works.
283760	289760	I mean, so now that it's completely clear, I have a personalized picture up, I played
289760	295400	UNO, and I played UNO with the camera, and it's very, I don't know, it can be boring
295400	296400	and I guess weird.
296400	299160	All right, how many people did you show your ass to?
299160	302720	I didn't show my ass to anybody, but someone had their camera pointed towards the ceiling,
302720	307440	they're all, oh yeah, I forgot to unplug it, it had fallen behind like the TV or something,
307440	313560	and then like just another person that was just sitting there, and then just, you know,
313560	314560	someone else.
314560	319360	And you know what sucked, is we only had like three people I think, and the computer player
319360	322880	just kicked all of our asses, so that kind of sucked.
322880	324840	I did win one game though.
324840	325840	Good job.
325840	334000	And then, what else did I play, I played Doom, and Doom was kind of fun, and then Rob dragged
334000	339920	me into a multiplayer game, and the multiplayer game was so laggy as fucking hell.
339920	343480	But I don't know, I haven't played any other additional multiplayer games other than that,
343480	346480	so I couldn't really say if that's like all the other games.
346480	351680	It seems, I seem to have this kind of bad track record with lagging multiplayer games
351680	356760	just from all the, you know, my first Saints Row game was crap, you know, multiplayer wise
356760	359800	was all laggy, and then Doom was all laggy.
359800	366120	So I don't know, it looks fun, so I'll probably try that some more a little bit later.
366120	371640	And then of course Nellie's been playing a lot of Zuma, and I've been playing, you know,
371640	376520	quite a bit of Zuma, and we're pretty far in that.
376520	380160	We actually have achievements, we got the one for 24 hours, which is pretty interesting.
380160	381160	That's kind of sad.
381160	383400	But, she plays a lot, okay.
383400	387800	Seriously, she's been playing 360 more than I have, which is kind of interesting.
387800	392840	Saints Row wise, I actually have been playing through Saints Row, it's pretty fun, and I
392840	398560	tried cheating this week, ooh, food.
398560	403860	But it didn't work like I wanted it to, because you see, you get points, or you get money
403860	410120	accrued to you as time passes in game, and so I was just going to leave the game on and
410120	414260	have my character walk around in circles with the analog stick, you know.
414260	418800	But somehow I knew that I was doing that, and so I didn't get that much money, it just
418800	420960	wasn't coming as fast as I thought it would.
420960	426040	Either way, I found out robbing a bunch of stores in a row is a lot better than just
426040	429880	standing there waiting for time to pass.
429880	434560	I'm going to our always present fourth guest that we have here on Orange Launch Radio,
434560	439720	the chat room over at orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat, and I noticed that Jeremy Todd
439720	443240	says, OMG, Matt is turning Nellie into a gamer.
443240	448840	She loves her PopCap games, and God forbid they release Bejeweled 3, I'll never see the
448840	449840	360 again.
449840	453200	That is a vicious lie!
453200	456200	I will never be a gamer, ever!
456200	462640	I will sell my baby before I do that.
462640	466240	Remind me to shut the door when we tape next time.
466240	470120	No, I did play one other thing.
470120	473240	I got the beta, which is funny because I got this in the mail.
473240	477760	I got the beta for Killzone Liberation, and I don't like it.
477760	478760	I'm sorry.
478760	483080	I don't like what they're doing with the PSP as far as taking these really good first person
483080	488680	shooters and then all of a sudden, look, now it's an isometric 3D third person shooter
488680	491120	game.
491120	494400	It's just not as cool, I'm sorry.
494400	500320	50 Cent Bulletproof sucked, and Killzone, it's just not my type of game, that style.
500320	505000	I would rather it be a first person shooter, like Full Auto 2, well, Full Auto 2 is going
505000	510760	to be probably a first person camera thing, which is coming out on the PSP later on March.
510760	514800	No one's mentioned that yet, no magazines at least, because you know, once it hits the
514800	516440	magazine, then it'll be fact.
516440	519040	We'll get to that later in the show, yes.
519040	520040	Save your angst, please.
520040	521040	Is that it?
521040	526960	Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, just stop mentioning it, we know you played
526960	529720	the damn thing, all your work breaks, just get over it.
529720	534100	We keep complaining about it, and we're like, we gotta switch to another game, but I'm confident
534100	536680	that we'll move on to Vice City Stories and hopefully a multiple percenter.
536680	539760	I don't get you, you're the only gamer I know that'll be like, God, I hate this game and
539760	541000	I can't stop playing.
541000	544480	I'm addicted, what can I say?
544480	548440	My Gaming Week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, although I did play Doom, and
548440	555200	Doom, you know, it's interesting, because I don't want to like Doom because of the fact
555200	560360	it's 800 points, because of the fact that the game is basically free on the PC, I mean,
560360	564920	they released the source code some time ago, and for the fact that really, you can play
564920	568880	Doom on the Xbox 360 without downloading it for Marketplace.
568880	573120	Just get a copy of Doom 3 Collector's Edition, because the Doom 3 Collector's Edition had
573120	577140	Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 as playable games in it.
577140	582120	So really the only thing that this new Doom adds is the Xbox Live component, and they,
582120	584480	you know, touch some things up.
584480	588360	They say the graphics are improved, but, you know, come on, it's still the pixelated wonder
588360	591320	we all remember from the old PC days.
591320	594760	But that being said, I do love Doom.
594760	596520	I do love me some Doom, an awful lot.
596520	597520	Yes, Jamie?
597520	602600	It just has ultra-violence and hurt me plenty, and I love the titles of the difficulty levels.
602600	606000	Yes, I mean, it still has all that wonder that made it such a great game in the 90s,
606000	609720	and I'll tell you what, there really is something to be said, because I used to play this game
609720	614040	on my slow-ass 486 computer, and I would have to shrink the window down to get a decent
614040	615040	frame rate.
615040	619240	You know, I'm squinting on this little 15-inch monitor to play Doom, and now I'm playing
619240	624120	it on my, like, my new TV that's, like, 32-inch, you know, high def.
624120	627120	I know some of you guys have bigger TVs, but just bear with me here.
627120	630880	You know, that big, huge screen and high def, it's, there's something to be said about that.
630880	632320	The game actually scared me today.
632320	637120	I turned around, and one of those little imp things that looks like that creature from
637120	641840	Signs that ran by, forget it, but that thing scared the hell out of me, and I'm like, ah,
641840	643080	I shouldn't get scared at this.
643080	646520	These things are pixelated and not supposed to freak me out, but it did, and so I think
646520	650800	there's still something to be said about the fact that Doom still has that, you know, charm
650800	653120	and has lasted all these years.
653120	656720	Xbox Live is hit and miss.
656720	659520	Sometimes I get into a quick match game, and I've played some death match, and it works
659520	663880	pretty well, but, like, I played a game with a listener and Loki, and it was laggy as hell,
663880	666400	so I don't know if one of us just had a bad connection or what was going on, but that
666400	672120	kind of made me sad, but, you know, I don't know.
672120	676720	If Xbox Live Play is something that interests you, if having this game on your TV set is
676720	680360	something that interests you, then it's a decent buy, and you want to get achievement
680360	684520	points or whatever, then cool, but otherwise, you know, maybe you ought to just download
684520	688020	the one that's on the computer if you just want to play Doom and you don't really care
688020	689480	about where you do it.
689480	691360	Do the cheats work?
691360	692360	I don't know.
692360	693360	I haven't plugged in my keyboard.
693360	694360	No.
694360	695360	Did you?
695360	696360	It doesn't work?
696360	697360	No, I read it somewhere, though.
697360	698360	Lame.
698360	699360	I'd have to try it out for myself, though, because, what was it?
699360	706000	IDDQD was god mode, and IDNRA, no, that was, NRA was hexen.
706000	708440	So somebody tried plugging in the keyboard and doing it because we thought about it,
708440	710640	we just, oh, that sucks.
710640	712880	Can you use the keyboard as a controller?
712880	713880	I don't know.
713880	714880	That I have to try.
714880	715880	I wonder if the chatroom knows the answer.
715880	717920	I'm sorry, I can't play Doom with a controller.
717920	720920	No, it actually really works for me.
720920	725120	I can move around in ways I couldn't before with the keyboard.
725120	733360	The keyboard, if you know your side step toggles and everything, it shouldn't be a problem.
733360	735440	There will be people that are keyboard for life.
735440	741040	A lot of PC gamers, if they're mostly the type that games on PC exclusively, they're
741040	745080	going to probably be keyboard for life, but they've gotten used to that.
745080	747400	I still haven't really, I don't know.
747400	750560	I can do it in World of Warcraft, but I can't really do it in Doom as well.
750560	752760	The other kid was IDBFG, I think.
752760	753760	Sorry.
753760	756800	Yeah, that's, I forgot how much I hate the BFG in multiplayer.
756800	759400	I really, really hate the BFG in multiplayer.
759400	765640	Thank you to, thanks to Jaded2006's IDDQD, IDKFA was the one I was trying to think of,
765640	768600	IDKLAV, and IDBFG will give you the BFG.
768600	769600	Nice.
769600	772400	Now our whole chatroom is going off.
772400	773400	My game was hexen.
773400	774400	I was really.
774400	777520	Now that I would like to see come out on the Marketplace.
777520	779240	If you type in Satan, you get god mode.
779240	781040	Rise of the Triad.
781040	782840	DMN will agree with you.
782840	787000	And also, I was really hoping they'd release Duke Nukem 3D.
787000	788000	I wish.
788000	789000	I really hope that happens.
789000	794100	I want someone to do a Quake hack and turn it into Silent Hill.
794100	799800	You know, that's too bad that we can't load those custom-made Doom WAD files on the Xbox
799800	800800	Live Marketplace.
800800	803800	Wouldn't that be cool, like if they released some of the best ones, like just add-ons in
803800	804800	the marketplace?
804800	808680	I had Gachamon Doom, and I would play the hell out of that.
808680	809680	Uber nerd.
809680	810680	I love Gachamon.
810680	811680	I love Uber nerd.
811680	815360	We had, my favorite one was Killing Barney, where Barney was the final boss.
815360	816360	I remember that one.
816360	817360	Was that a Wolfenstein hack?
817360	818360	No, they had both.
818360	819360	All right.
819360	820360	There's also a Quake one too.
820360	824120	All right, anyway, moving on from Doom, I can talk about DDR Supernova now.
824120	828680	DDR Supernova is great, I mean, if you're into DDR, I don't think there's anything new
828680	834880	here that's going to win somebody who hasn't really played DDR before into this game, although
834880	838120	you know, just like every other DDR before it, it has beginner modes and things you can
838120	839120	learn on.
839120	843040	Konami took some risks with the song list, but I think they paid off.
843040	847280	I rather enjoy the song list, and when I say they took risks, I mean they didn't do a carbon
847280	850640	copy of the arcade machine, which I think a lot of people were expecting, but I found
850640	853520	some of the new steps and the new songs to be quite pleasant.
853520	858000	I did find it really interesting that they had some of the songs that were just now put
858000	864040	into the arcade mix, well it was like Fascination, the Eternal Love thing, which to be honest,
864040	868880	that was about as interesting to me as Paranoia Survivor and Paranoia Survivor Max.
868880	872860	You know what, a lot of love out there though for Fascination, the Eternal Love mix, a lot
872860	878720	of love out there on the forums for it, so you have your opinion, they have theirs.
878720	883520	As far as the rest of the game, it's obvious that Konami has listened to a lot of the bitches
883520	888320	that people had about EX2, especially when it came to Dance Master mode, because this
888320	890480	new Stellar Magic mode is kind of neat.
890480	892600	It's a little bit different.
892600	896360	I wouldn't say it's necessarily easier, but it does seem like you can get your unlocks
896360	902440	a little bit easier than you could previously, except the uber hard stuff, but the uber hard
902440	906040	stuff is supposed to be uber hard to get, so you just have to work for it.
906040	909600	Otherwise I rather like the game, I would recommend it certainly to any DDR fan and
909600	912840	folks that are into music games at all, I think it is one of the better DDR mixes they
912840	915800	have released on PlayStation 2.
915800	918760	I don't know, I still have a place in my heart for Max 2 though, so I don't know if I could
918760	922240	call it the best, but it's definitely one of my favorites, and certainly much better
922240	927240	than like Max 1 and Extreme War, it's certainly on the upper end of PlayStation 2 DDR mixes,
927240	932800	so I do recommend it for DDR fans, and if you hate DDR, well then you're probably going
932800	937680	to hate Supernova, so there's nothing new for you here, move along.
937680	941360	Other than that, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff, I was playing 99 Nights
941360	945640	for a little bit, I was watching my friend play Enchanted Arms, because I haven't been
945640	948160	playing it a lot, but I've been watching my friend play through that while I play World
948160	955400	of Warcraft on the Mac, and I went back to Beatmania 2DX, because Loki gave me that second
955400	958040	controller, so I was like, ooh, I can play doubles now!
958040	962560	I really suck at doubles, because I've lost a lot of my 2DX skill in general, like I'm
962560	967160	just barely passing some sevens, I used to be able to get some of the flashing sevens
967160	971360	out and things, but I'm working my way up on doubles, doubles is fun, it's kind of renewing
971360	974720	my interest in 2DX all over again, so I'll have to get some of the newer styles.
974720	977040	The newest one I have is Night Style, isn't that sad?
977040	982680	There's been like 10th, 11th, and Happy Sky, or 10th Red and Happy Sky on the way.
982680	990120	I've played the Pirate King game, and I've gotten Red, and I'm actually looking at more
990120	997280	of the Guitar Freaks games like V, and the Silver Collection, or whatever it is, some
997280	998520	import one.
998520	1002240	But next week though, I was hoping to have a review for it this week, Earth Defense Force
1002240	1006120	2 is the game I'm going to be playing, which for those who may have seen some of the stuff
1006120	1011080	coming from Tokyo Game Show, Earth Defense Force 3 was the first Simple 2000 game that's
1011080	1015760	going to be on the Xbox 360, so I've got to play the one before it, because that one's
1015760	1017040	not out yet.
1017040	1022040	I have to talk about as well some of the Xbox 360 bringing it home demos and trailers that
1022040	1023360	I downloaded.
1023360	1027160	I played the Fusion Frenzy 2 demo, which you gave a negative review on last week's show.
1027160	1031320	I didn't think it was that bad, I just think the demo's pretty quick.
1031320	1035280	There's really only three mini games to play, but the demo's not supposed to give away the
1035280	1038560	whole game, so I thought it was presented well and might make a decent game.
1038560	1042200	Maybe in a party game environment that'd be cool, but playing single player sucks.
1042200	1046000	Exactly, single player sucks, but Mario Party single player sucks too.
1046000	1051000	So I think Fusion Frenzy 2 has potential to be pretty good, so the demo is kind of one
1051000	1052000	of those wait and see things.
1052000	1055160	I'm going to wait and see how much the full version costs and make a decision from there.
1055160	1057920	I did see a demo from Tokyo Game Show of a game I want to play.
1057920	1058920	What's that?
1058920	1059920	Project Silphied.
1059920	1060920	Mmm.
1060920	1061920	It's pretty...
1061920	1067040	I also got to see the demo for, what was it, White Knight for PS3, but it actually could
1067040	1068600	convince me to buy one.
1068600	1069600	Really?
1069600	1072720	$49.99 is what Fusion Frenzy, let's see, that's a little high for me.
1072720	1073720	I don't know.
1073720	1076080	I don't know enough party game things at the house to justify that.
1076080	1078760	It's kind of one of those things maybe after Christmas it'll drop to $29.39.
1078760	1083160	It's really bad timing too because it's coming out, what, a couple weeks before the Wii?
1083160	1084760	That thing's spring party game.
1084760	1085760	Yeah, I don't know.
1085760	1086760	I don't know about Fusion Frenzy.
1086760	1089960	I'll tell you this, I definitely know about this one though and I'm sorry because it's
1089960	1095640	probably going to make some people cry, but the Sonic the Hedgehog demo came out on 360.
1095640	1096640	It's awful.
1096640	1097640	I told you all!
1097640	1098640	It's absolutely horrible.
1098640	1099640	Didn't I tell everybody?
1099640	1104680	Well, yeah, I played the one on PlayStation 3 and that was god-awful.
1104680	1105680	I played the Xbox.
1105680	1107240	They had it out on the floor at E3.
1107240	1110760	See, I didn't bother to play the Xbox 360 one at that time because I hated the PS3 one.
1110760	1114240	I hunted it down just to see if it was going to break my heart any less.
1114240	1117400	And it's pretty much the same demo they had at E3, by the way, which is not in the marketplace
1117400	1118400	now.
1118400	1119400	The control was like, I love my Dreamcast one.
1119400	1124320	I'm going to go play it as soon as I get home to cleanse my heart.
1124320	1130600	I can't explain why Sonic the Hedgehog has just gone so awful with this new one.
1130600	1133720	Somebody pointed out to me, I want to say it was in an email or something, I think it
1133720	1137960	was Rob sent me this, our friend on the East Coast, Rob, I want to say something that's
1137960	1141920	an email, something about, you know, the test drive unlimited demo wasn't that hot either
1141920	1144760	and the final game was pretty decent, but I don't know.
1144760	1147440	I don't know if there's much that can save this Sonic.
1147440	1150040	I mean, the controls are awful.
1150040	1152800	Trying to manipulate Sonic was just bad.
1152800	1154480	Where did Sonic go wrong?
1154480	1159360	Because Sonic hasn't been this bad in 3D before, because I remember the last one they had on
1159360	1161080	GameCube wasn't that bad.
1161080	1167400	It was even okay on, do you remember the Sonic collection that came out on the Saturn, had
1167400	1170600	the 3D running around the world bit in it?
1170600	1174240	That was better control than...
1174240	1175840	It's awful.
1175840	1179480	You have to download this just to see how far downhill the series has gone.
1179480	1180480	It's kind of sad.
1180480	1183520	It almost feels like they tried to retool the engine or something, but...
1183520	1187760	They're just trying to figure out, you know, how they can, because Sonic is just, you know,
1187760	1192440	it's been the same game all the time, they're trying to really, trying to re-jump, you know,
1192440	1197240	jubilize the whole franchise, because you had Shadow the Hedgehog, which they were trying
1197240	1199880	to go a different way with it, and it sucked.
1199880	1201360	It sold horribly.
1201360	1206840	And then you have Sonic Riders, which, you know, it's a pretty fun racing game, but that
1206840	1208400	one actually did pretty well.
1208400	1214320	Now Sonic the Hedgehog, the problem is, I think now you've got, where it's trying, I
1214320	1219280	don't even know what the, it's like, not even close to what the original Sonic the Hedgehog
1219280	1220280	games were.
1220280	1224400	I mean, as far as the storyline and everything, now you're trying to like, throw in elements
1224400	1226800	almost like a Final Fantasy or something like that?
1226800	1227800	I don't know.
1227800	1232080	And then, you know, all these new characters with each game and stuff, it's just kind of
1232080	1233080	crazy.
1233080	1237000	Plus, now that the systems are even faster and they can crunch the graphics even faster,
1237000	1239100	so Sonic is even faster.
1239100	1243440	But the problem is, he doesn't control any better, so you have the same kind of control
1243440	1248040	and response time as you did on the Sonic games that were slower, now that the thing
1248040	1252640	is like, lightning fast, it's really hard to control.
1252640	1258080	I'm going to the chat room and reading some of the comments here on Sonic demo.
1258080	1260040	Footy Monster says, Wanna save Sonic?
1260040	1262120	Go back to Sonic Adventure 2.
1262120	1266020	Funny Dale says, Well, you know, the last few Sonic games sucked ass as well.
1266020	1267720	You know, not this bad though.
1267720	1274200	I mean, nothing to me has matched the greatness of the old Genesis ones, Sonic 1, 2, and 3,
1274200	1275720	and Sonic Spinball, of course.
1275720	1279520	Nothing has really matched that for me, but like, even the last few ones, whereas they
1279520	1283160	weren't that good, they weren't this bad.
1283160	1289320	Sonic Adventure is probably about the, I'd have to say the pinnacle of the whole 3D tribe.
1289320	1293920	And you know, I feel bad because I don't want to review a game based off the demo, but the
1293920	1298240	reality is, if you're going to put this demo on Marketplace so people can sample the game,
1298240	1300880	people are going to make decisions about the game based off this demo.
1300880	1304840	And I was excited about Sonic the Hedgehog for Next Gen, but now I am absolutely not.
1304840	1307000	You were forgotten, by the way.
1307000	1308000	Sonic CD.
1308000	1313880	Well, it's been like four months since the E3 demo came out, and it hasn't really improved
1313880	1318320	since then, so that kind of, either a couple things happened, one, they just didn't have
1318320	1322600	time to make a new demo, so they just put out the E3 demo, or two, the game hasn't really
1322600	1324080	improved since then.
1324080	1328880	All right, well if you're a fan of the new Sonic game, maybe there's something about
1328880	1329880	it we're missing.
1329880	1330880	We'd love to hear from you.
1330880	1333000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1333000	1335440	We're always willing to hear some difference of opinions.
1335440	1340200	We might say you're wrong, wrong, wrong, but no, we'll definitely read your emails on them.
1340200	1344200	Now, Jamie, did you see SmackDown vs. RIO 7?
1344200	1347920	I actually found the story on that that we're going to be discussing.
1347920	1348920	Oh, cool.
1348920	1352320	Well, I guess we'll get into the news since we're starting to touch on some of the things
1352320	1356320	we wanted to talk about tonight, and the first thing in tonight's gaming news is, of course,
1356320	1360000	as we talked about in our gaming weeks, Doom came out on Xbox Live.
1360000	1363600	What was somewhat interesting about the way Doom came out on Xbox Live is that it was
1363600	1365120	very stealth.
1365120	1368880	Microsoft had said that there was a secret project they were working on, and a really
1368880	1373440	big series was coming to Xbox Live, and some other folks had speculated that the series
1373440	1375000	was Lode Runner.
1375000	1376560	You remember the old school game Lode Runner?
1376560	1379840	I remember it on Commodore 64, but it was on a bunch of old school platforms, and a
1379840	1381720	lot of people were convinced that was it.
1381720	1384720	Well, it turns out that's not it, at least right now.
1384720	1385720	I mean, who's to say?
1385720	1386720	That could come out in the future.
1386720	1391560	It looks like Doom was the secret game that Microsoft was hinting at, and they did one
1391560	1395000	of those things where they came out and said, Doom is coming out on Xbox Live Marketplace
1395000	1396000	right now.
1396000	1397960	Go download it, and it really caught a lot of people off guard.
1397960	1401840	I think some websites that morning caught wind of what was going on.
1401840	1407840	Probably somebody broke the embargo that Microsoft had no doubt placed, but for all realistic
1407840	1411640	purposes, a less than 24-hour leak is really not bad in this day and age, so they really
1411640	1412640	kept a lid on it.
1412640	1415080	Yeah, a certain website we don't like to talk about broke the embargo.
1415080	1416680	Oh, well, whatever.
1416680	1417680	Good for them.
1417680	1423680	So anyway, of course, Doom Live supports multiplayer on one screen or on multiple screens via Xbox
1423680	1424760	Live.
1424760	1428960	It is Doom 1, not Doom 2, and some people would say Doom 2 is the superior game, but
1428960	1429960	who knows?
1429960	1433620	If this is out now and does well, I'd say Doom 2 is just a matter of time.
1433620	1437240	But as a reminder, if you have the Doom 3 Collector's Edition, you already can play
1437240	1443760	Doom on the Xbox 360, but of course with this, you get achievements, slightly improved graphics,
1443760	1444760	and the Xbox Live play.
1444760	1449480	Next, we'll see Quake 2, because that was on Quake 4, except it had achievements, but
1449480	1451840	you didn't get any points for it.
1451840	1455300	How about Quake 1 with the original Trent Reznor music?
1455300	1456300	That would be kind of fun.
1456300	1458000	That would be really fun.
1458000	1462920	I was also surprised that Doom 1 was only 22 megabytes to download, but then again,
1462920	1466400	I guess that's probably how big it was back then.
1466400	1471280	Back then, my hard drive was only like 100 megabytes, so it was a huge game at the time.
1471280	1473720	So you know, it's just kind of interesting how far technology has come in the past.
1473720	1476320	I remember spanning floppies with that thing.
1476320	1477320	Yeah.
1477320	1478320	So we'll see.
1478320	1480160	Maybe some future ID software games coming next.
1480160	1481160	Who knows?
1481160	1482160	We'll see.
1482160	1488900	Well, as far as things that we need to see about, our dear, dear director friend Peter
1488900	1498160	Jackson has decided that he's got his interest stuck in the Xbox 360 as a new medium for
1498160	1499160	storytelling.
1499160	1505140	And he said that his team at Wingnut Studios is working with Microsoft to co-design and
1505140	1513120	co-produce an original chapter in the Halo stories with Bungie.
1513120	1516900	They haven't named it or anything yet, but the quote says here, to captivate a new audience
1516900	1521600	that has yet to discover the power of interactive entertainment, Microsoft has built an amazing
1521600	1526040	living canvas with Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, which allows the storytellers of our time
1526040	1529040	to express themselves in a new medium.
1529040	1531480	I think that's pretty neat.
1531480	1539000	It's good that big names are starting to recognize exactly just the basically limitless freedom
1539000	1542600	that a video game will give them in terms of creativity.
1542600	1544200	I think it's kind of interesting.
1544200	1547360	I can't claim to be the world's hugest fan of Lord of the Rings.
1547360	1548360	Don't get me wrong.
1548360	1553600	I thought the movies were good, but I think this is really neat and it sort of to me legitimizes
1553600	1554600	gaming in a way.
1554600	1559160	I mean, here you have this Oscar-winning director coming over and saying, hey, I'm going to
1559160	1562080	make a game.
1562080	1567040	It's a little different than previous attempts to kind of bring Hollywood into games a little
1567040	1568040	more.
1568040	1569040	Does anyone remember Apocalyptico?
1569040	1570040	Was that the name of the game?
1570040	1571040	No, that's that movie.
1571040	1574280	Apocalyptico is a string quartet.
1574280	1576480	Sorry, I'm thinking of the Mel Gibson movie.
1576480	1579160	No, there was a game on PS1 with Bruce Willis.
1579160	1580160	Was it Apocalypse?
1580160	1582200	I think it was Apocalypse.
1582200	1583680	Something like that.
1583680	1585040	That game was not so hot.
1585040	1587280	Well, the movie was not so hot.
1587280	1588280	It wasn't based on a movie.
1588280	1589280	Wasn't it?
1589280	1590280	I don't think so.
1590280	1591280	No, it wasn't.
1591280	1592280	Wasn't Bruce Willis in a movie called Apocalypse?
1592280	1593280	I don't know.
1593280	1595040	It was where they had to go drill a hole in the meteor?
1595040	1597160	No, you're thinking of Armageddon.
1597160	1598160	Armageddon.
1598160	1599160	Same difference.
1599160	1600160	Oh, my God.
1600160	1602360	No, this is different.
1602360	1603360	This was like a...
1603360	1604360	I don't know, but anyway.
1604360	1605360	Just to expand...
1605360	1606360	Oh, sorry.
1606360	1607360	Go ahead.
1607360	1608360	There was a little bit more, yeah.
1608360	1613120	Just to expand, Wingnut Studios, as I referred to earlier, is Peter Jackson's new entertainment
1613120	1618400	studio that has his movie team and Microsoft's gaming division working together.
1618400	1621720	I thought that was pretty cool, too.
1621720	1623240	A comment from our chat room here.
1623240	1627000	Jeremy Todd 1 says, Didn't Peter Jackson help in making the King Kong game?
1627000	1628280	That game wasn't that bad.
1628280	1630680	Peter Jackson is probably my favorite movie director.
1630680	1631880	I haven't played the King Kong game.
1631880	1633920	I do believe he had a hand in it, actually.
1633920	1637000	Well, he probably had to give some type of approval to it because it is his movie and
1637000	1638520	it had his name in the title, so...
1638520	1641520	Yeah, but I don't know if he actually worked on the game.
1641520	1645480	I doubt it was that same level of involvement that he's going to have with this Halo project.
1645480	1649160	I have this theory that he probably saw it in progress, was really inspired, and said,
1649160	1651120	hey, I want to be a part of something else.
1651120	1652120	That's a distinct possibility.
1652120	1653120	Yeah.
1653120	1657440	I mean, that's how half of anybody really gets into anything is they have to be introduced
1657440	1658920	to it first, right?
1658920	1659920	Mm-hmm.
1659920	1663840	Well, some other cool stuff came out about the Halo franchise during X06.
1663840	1668920	Unfortunately, nothing about Halo 3 because they said, later on this year, you'll hear
1668920	1672480	something, you know, which will probably be even timed with the PlayStation 3 launch or
1672480	1673480	something like that.
1673480	1677680	But anyways, one very interesting thing, which kind of ties in with the whole story we had
1677680	1685040	last week about the real-time strategy Halo mod that was coming out and how it had been
1685040	1690960	cancelled and basically pulled by Microsoft, and Bungie said, hey, stop making this.
1690960	1691960	Well...
1691960	1692960	Cease and Desist.
1692960	1693960	Yes.
1693960	1695560	Wonderful Cease and Desist.
1695560	1700240	Well, it comes, you know, it came out that they're actually making a Halo RTS type of
1700240	1701960	game called Halo Wars.
1701960	1705040	It's being put together by Ensemble Studios and Bungie.
1705040	1709740	Ensemble, you might remember, did the Age of Empires series.
1709740	1714280	So it should be pretty cool looking and kind of by the looks of the trailer that also hit
1714280	1718640	the Xbox Live Marketplace, it looks very Starcraft-ish.
1718640	1721440	So it should fill that void a little bit, at least.
1721440	1723520	That'll be if I want to play on live, I bet.
1723520	1724520	Yeah.
1724520	1725520	That'd be hugely popular.
1725520	1726520	I think so.
1726520	1729920	I think they're trying to almost grab the same audience of Starcraft with this.
1729920	1732640	Now, I have a question for you guys.
1732640	1737060	Do you think that this could be, you know, with this Peter Jackson project and Halo Wars
1737060	1739960	and Halo 3 on the horizon, is this too much Halo?
1739960	1742520	Are we headed for an oversaturation of Halo in the market?
1742520	1743520	No.
1743520	1744520	No.
1744520	1747680	Because the timeframe that these games are coming out with, this, you know, one that
1747680	1753660	Peter Jackson's probably working on, probably won't even see it next year, if you know anything.
1753660	1758040	So you have like Halo 3 coming out, probably then Halo Wars coming out a little bit later
1758040	1763120	on, maybe early 2008 or something, and then this Peter Jackson one coming out at the end
1763120	1764940	of 2008 or 2009.
1764940	1767980	Do you think, and this is just a thought that just occurred to me, because remember when
1767980	1772560	you gave us that huge thing, that list in episode 198 when you went to the, you know,
1772560	1775540	they had the sales people come to your work and everything, one of the things you said
1775540	1779520	is that Halo 3, surprise, surprise, is coming out in April or May, right?
1779520	1780520	And a lot of March or April.
1780520	1781520	I'm sorry, March or April.
1781520	1785160	A lot of people are still very skeptical about that release, but could this be now that we
1785160	1787480	know that there's another Halo project being worked on?
1787480	1791200	Because everybody was saying, oh, Halo 3's got to be Christmas, Halo 3's got to be Christmas.
1791200	1796760	Is it possible that now Halo Wars is their Christmas title, and Halo 3 is indeed going
1796760	1798360	to make the March or April release?
1798360	1799360	It's possible.
1799360	1800360	Speculation.
1800360	1801360	I don't know.
1801360	1808960	Did you see the story this week about, what was it, amazon.com had Halo 3 pre-orders and
1808960	1814680	the release date was March 31st, which I thought was interesting, but, you know, who knows.
1814680	1815680	We'll see what happens.
1815680	1820740	Now, again, and I hate reading from the same person consistently, but everybody else is
1820740	1825320	doing flooding in our chat room right now, Jeremy Tom 1 says, Bungie is turning into
1825320	1826320	EA.
1826320	1829840	They are starting to put new Halo games out every year and seriously milking the franchise.
1829840	1830840	Wrong.
1830840	1835800	I don't think any Halo 06 or Halo 07 are actually mixing things up instead of just updating
1835800	1836800	roster.
1836800	1839320	I don't really agree with the comments to an extent either.
1839320	1840680	I don't think they're necessarily milking the franchise.
1840680	1845360	If the games are good, the games are good, no matter what they're based on.
1845360	1849520	If we see Halo Party or something like that, then yeah, okay, there's a problem, but I
1849520	1853240	think right now we're pretty fine with the amount of Halo content that's out there.
1853240	1858040	When you think about it, what, there's been like two games so far and now a possible third
1858040	1862040	and then we're adding a couple more to the franchise, that's not really overkill yet.
1862040	1866560	It's not like Final Fantasy or Mario or anything like that.
1866560	1870960	That's true and Tweak says every year, there's two.
1870960	1873080	It's not like there's a lot on the horizon.
1873080	1877480	You're right, it's not something like Final Fantasy where you have the game and now they're
1877480	1881160	doing what, like three different spin-offs of Final Fantasy XII and XIII and then you
1881160	1886320	got the tactical games and the Crystal Chronicles games, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing
1886320	1890400	because most of those Final Fantasy games have been pretty darn good games, so it's
1890400	1891800	not necessarily a bad thing.
1891800	1894280	As long as they keep the quality up, that's all that matters.
1894280	1897400	In fact, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the few tactical games that held my attention,
1897400	1900200	I'm just not really into tactical games usually.
1900200	1902240	Why hasn't there been a new Final Fantasy Tactics?
1902240	1906080	Because Square Enix has bastard people working for them.
1906080	1907720	Just kidding, just kidding.
1907720	1914640	Alright, anyway, another news that came out of X06, it's of note, no pun intended, Guitar
1914640	1918400	Hero 2 has finally been confirmed for the Xbox 360.
1918400	1922920	We've been speculating this for weeks and weeks, so this really shouldn't be big news,
1922920	1925160	but it was confirmed officially.
1925160	1927600	There's a new controller coming out as well.
1927600	1932360	Despite news reports that were based off some pictures that were taken at X06, the controller
1932360	1934400	is not wireless.
1934400	1937800	There's no word yet if the controller will be wireless or not, if there will be a wireless
1937800	1938800	version.
1938800	1941320	I kind of hope there's not.
1941320	1946140	If there is, I hope they offer a wired version still, because wireless means more money,
1946140	1948560	and the last thing I want to have to spend on Guitar Hero is more money.
1948560	1954280	It's not, and that's because it's a requirement that they have for their third party peripheral
1954280	1958200	makers that it has to be wired, which is weird because I thought that they had wireless controllers
1958200	1963540	made by like Mad Cats and stuff, but I guess when it comes down to these weird guitar controllers
1963540	1967760	or dance pads that come, it's got to be wired, so I don't know.
1967760	1970560	Also with it being a music game and stuff, you probably don't want wireless even though
1970560	1974280	granted, Microsoft may be able to pull off the wireless controllers without lag, but
1974280	1976660	I don't think third parties can, so.
1976660	1980120	I have to be honest, and I don't know how you guys feel about this, but now that I know
1980120	1984400	this news, I don't really want to pick up Guitar Hero on PS2 when it comes out.
1984400	1986120	I'm going to wait for the 360 one.
1986120	1987120	That's kind of sad.
1987120	1991040	Because if it's going to have the microtransactions and the next gen graphics, and I've pretty
1991040	1995340	much been starting to play Xbox 360 more and more, and I know I'll be playing Wii more and
1995340	1999800	more when that comes out, and eventually when I finally decide to buy one, PlayStation 3,
1999800	2002920	you know, I'll kind of be phasing out the old gen games, I don't know if I really want
2002920	2007160	to pick up Guitar Hero 2 on PS2.
2007160	2008160	I don't know.
2008160	2010160	Do you guys feel similar?
2010160	2013600	I would have personally have announced this at the end of the year instead of...
2013600	2015040	And then make us feel really screwed.
2015040	2016040	That would have been great.
2016040	2017520	It's a way to make more money.
2017520	2018520	Exactly.
2018520	2019520	I guess that's true.
2019520	2020520	Jamie, what do you think?
2020520	2021520	I know you're a Guitar Hero fan.
2021520	2022520	Are you going to purchase the one on PlayStation 2?
2022520	2024400	Are you going to hold out for this one or what?
2024400	2027240	Why don't I just get them both?
2027240	2028240	I forgot.
2028240	2029240	You're a whore for everything.
2029240	2030240	Gaming.
2030240	2031240	Gaming.
2031240	2034880	I don't see where the debate is.
2034880	2039320	I have both systems, I should have both games, especially if they do something different
2039320	2041880	for one than the other.
2041880	2045960	I honestly, my preference would be to have it on Xbox 360 if they're not doing anything
2045960	2052320	different for it, because I would rather not have like jaggedy edges, and I'd rather have
2052320	2060060	better sound capability and more processing power, and the ability to potentially download
2060060	2061060	more songs.
2061060	2062060	Exactly.
2062060	2064800	For me, it's like Karaoke Revolution on Xbox versus PlayStation 2.
2064800	2068720	I love the PlayStation 2, and it's great, but when you put the two platforms side by
2068720	2073820	side in a game like Karaoke Revolution, I could download more songs on the Xbox version,
2073820	2076800	and I could use my regular microphone as the microphone.
2076800	2081740	It kind of worked better on Xbox, and I have a feeling Guitar Hero 2 is going to be a little
2081740	2087440	better on 360 just because of the additional things that the 360 natively supports.
2087440	2093760	I need to completely tell Jaded2006 that, you're wrong, there are a lot, there's a lot
2093760	2094760	of graphical detail.
2094760	2098980	In fact, all the character models, they put a lot of work into them, the animations.
2098980	2102720	If you look at all the stuff that goes on on the stage in the backgrounds of these areas,
2102720	2104680	they're actually pretty darn good.
2104680	2108280	Oh, did he say that the Guitar Hero doesn't have that great graphics?
2108280	2110920	It just doesn't have that much in the way of graphics in the first place.
2110920	2111920	Yeah, it does.
2111920	2117760	DDR is just a bunch of movies playing in the background with edit character dancing.
2117760	2120560	This actually has a whole lot that went into it.
2120560	2125600	Which is actually part of the reason it did so well is because it really kind of had that
2125600	2131000	silly quality to it that kind of puts you there, you know what I mean?
2131000	2136040	Having all that stuff and the crowd and everything kind of did something for the game in a way
2136040	2137880	the guitar freaks didn't, you know what I mean?
2137880	2141000	I guess what I actually liked about it is that it sort of incorporated the things I
2141000	2144480	liked about Karaoke Revolution, you know, where you have the stage and the whole contest
2144480	2147560	thing and, you know, sort of like puts a little bit more into the game.
2147560	2151280	I thought it was like, yeah, let's go ahead and rock out here.
2151280	2156440	I thought that that was pretty cool, it added a great deal of fun to the game.
2156440	2161400	Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, his own show is over at AllGames.com on Sunday nights,
2161400	2162600	5 o'clock Pacific.
2162600	2167400	He says, it hit me, or it finally hit me that now I have to buy another guitar even though
2167400	2169640	I already have the PlayStation 2 one.
2169640	2170640	Yeah.
2170640	2171640	Wah wah.
2171640	2172640	Somewhere you're hearing that in the background.
2172640	2177320	You know how we felt trying to do second player with the guitar freaks controller?
2177320	2178320	Yeah.
2178320	2184440	Well now you guys know how we feel, you know, being DDR fans about all these DDR pads for
2184440	2185440	the different platforms, too.
2185440	2187000	It's like, God, I have five DDR pads.
2187000	2188740	They just get the multi-pad.
2188740	2193840	But even then, the Red Octane one, the last one they did, it doesn't support 360, so there's
2193840	2196840	going to be another pad that comes out I'm going to have to get for freaking Universe.
2196840	2197840	Yeah.
2197840	2198840	Oh well.
2198840	2204600	And you know they're not going to just go, let's support the USB pad from Red Octane.
2204600	2205600	Let's do that.
2205600	2206600	Let's do that favor.
2206600	2207600	Yeah.
2207600	2208600	No, it's not going to happen.
2208600	2209600	All right.
2209600	2214160	I do like the 360 guitar that looks like a Thunderbird, but anyway, we have a little
2214160	2216120	bit more.
2216120	2225000	Now, I don't know if all our listeners know this, but I am a closet wrestling fan, so
2225000	2235880	there is a demo for SmackDown versus Raw available on Xbox Live Marketplace for the 2007 version.
2235880	2242600	Also joining that is Tony Hawk's Project 8, Wheelman, Frontlines, Fuel of War, and Crossfire,
2242600	2246440	and the montage thing, which I actually haven't watched yet.
2246440	2250540	Also for our listeners who are in France, Italy, Germany, or Spain, if you miss the
2250540	2257560	Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion download content, it is back up for 150 Microsoft points a piece,
2257560	2258800	but I want my wrestling.
2258800	2264280	Yeah, they had some pretty good videos up on Live Marketplace.
2264280	2271080	Some interesting stuff also coming from X06, of course, a lot to even mention, but of course
2271080	2275200	they announced that Splinter Cell 5, the one after Double Agent, is going to be exclusive
2275200	2278440	to the 360, which I thought was pretty interesting.
2278440	2286000	Bioshock, the very amazing looking game, is going to be a 360 exclusive, which is coming
2286000	2292480	out in April, by the way, and also on the Windows platform.
2292480	2296880	The game looks amazing, so if you haven't checked out the video yet, please do yourself
2296880	2299400	a favor and check it out now.
2299400	2305100	Some surprises, I should say, Banjo-Kazooie, they announced a new game in that franchise
2305100	2313120	for the 360, some not so big surprises, Project Gotham Racing 4 was being worked on, and they
2313120	2315240	had a very generic looking trailer for that.
2315240	2319760	But the trailer was a joke, I mean it was nothing but, it was kind of like the Simpsons
2319760	2322760	teaser trailer, well at least that was funny, I mean it had a gag in it, but you know there
2322760	2326040	really wasn't anything to it, you know what I mean, it's just kind of like, the game's
2326040	2332880	coming, soon, I mean but the Halo 3 teaser trailer was like, ooh, you know, I am the
2332880	2335560	future, you know, that whole thing.
2335560	2336560	That's how you do a teaser trailer.
2336560	2342200	There will be an MMO coming to the Xbox 360 with Marvel Universe Online, which is supposed
2342200	2350640	to be kind of a sequel to, what was it, oh I'm drawing a mental blink now, I was going
2350640	2354320	to say, you know, Phantasy Star Universe is coming too, that's an MMO, but, well no, City
2354320	2359820	of Heroes, it seems to be working together on that, and they'll also be hitting Windows
2359820	2366200	as well, and it's even being worked on by Cryptic Studios, the, of course, creators
2366200	2367780	of City of Heroes.
2367780	2373760	And then finally, the last bit of info they talked about was the HD DVD player for the
2373760	2381240	Xbox 360, it's going to be priced at $199 in North America, with pretty much equivalent
2381240	2389320	pricing in the rest of the world, and they will be including a free copy, not to be surprising
2389320	2396560	after the whole announcement of Peter Jackson working on Halo of King Kong, as well as Universal
2396560	2398320	Remote.
2398320	2405520	That's a good movie to test your player on, because it's a nice, good, long, very long,
2405520	2412800	very overly long sample movie to include to test on the HD DVD player.
2412800	2415160	So yeah, lots of good stuff coming out.
2415160	2416520	I like the movie, it was just nice.
2416520	2421080	There was some other announcements, I think, that have already been made before about how
2421080	2426560	Rockstar is going to be making exclusive content for the Xbox 360 version of Gran Turismo 4,
2426560	2432520	which is not a huge, I mean, it's big, but, I mean, we already know that, and yeah, there's
2432520	2436780	lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of games and trailers, and they showed off Half-Life
2436780	2438800	2, and that looked pretty and stuff.
2438800	2443200	Now out of curiosity, did Rockstar say that they weren't doing something similar on
2443200	2448760	PlayStation 3, I mean, I know they said these episodes or whatever were exclusive for 360,
2448760	2453080	but if PlayStation 3 supports microtransactions, which after last week's Gran Turismo thing
2453080	2457560	we know it's going to, what's to say that they won't cook up different scenarios for
2457560	2460440	the PlayStation 3, and it'll be, you know, here's...
2460440	2462480	Or additional two, these two.
2462480	2466520	Or, you know, some different scenarios that are going to be on PlayStation 3, so it's
2466520	2471120	like, it's that whole, you know, Soul Calibur 2, play with Link on the GameCube, play with,
2471120	2473160	you know, Spawn on the Xbox all over again, you know?
2473160	2474400	Something a little different.
2474400	2479600	We don't know a whole lot about, you know, the PlayStation 3 marketplace or whatever,
2479600	2483960	so they might be running into other obstacles, you know, with this type of stuff, because
2483960	2488740	if you notice, a lot of like companies, I know Sega for Virtua Tennis 3 actually took
2488740	2494280	out online play on it, for the PlayStation 3 version, because apparently they're running
2494280	2499240	into some difficulties, so yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you see something, especially
2499240	2503640	if the marketplace is taken off, you know, after the PlayStation 3 launches.
2503640	2509080	I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4 is just going to be the next big thing.
2509080	2512960	I mean, it's just huge, so yeah, I can't wait.
2512960	2515200	Yeah, Saints Row's popularity is any indication.
2515200	2519400	I think 360 players are really eager for some Grand Theft Autos, so it should be interesting.
2519400	2523080	Saints Row will whet the appetite for now, but I can't wait.
2523080	2524640	All right, we'll see.
2524640	2528640	Well, now the only news to come out this week wasn't just about the Xbox.
2528640	2533080	I mean, granted, we have a lot of Xbox news because they had, you know, their big X06,
2533080	2534880	but there are some news on the other consoles.
2534880	2539600	One thing I want to say about the PlayStation 3, according to Bloomberg, Sony is going to
2539600	2542840	be launching a massive PlayStation 3 marketing campaign.
2542840	2548680	Now, they're going to have demo kiosks in five times as many stores as the PlayStation
2548680	2549680	2.
2549680	2552480	Yeah, the PlayStation 2 had about 3,000 demo stations.
2552480	2560520	The PlayStation 3 is supposedly going to have like 10,000 up to maybe 15,000 demo stations,
2560520	2565160	so that's like five times as many if it's 15,000, which is kind of weird when you consider
2565160	2568980	that there's supposed to be that big console shortage they're going to have at launch,
2568980	2572680	so it's like, you know, you could be putting some of that into producing extra consoles,
2572680	2573680	but whatever.
2573680	2579340	I mean, they're not saying that all five times of this is going to hit it once, so who knows?
2579340	2583800	Maybe they're running all off of the rack mount servers.
2583800	2585080	Maybe that's what they're going to use them for afterwards.
2585080	2586080	Who knows?
2586080	2587080	Actually, it might not be a bad idea.
2587080	2588080	Who knows?
2588080	2589080	That just was so pitiful.
2589080	2590080	Well, I mean...
2590080	2591080	I know.
2591080	2592080	I know.
2592080	2593080	I know.
2593080	2594080	You've got to do what you've got to do.
2594080	2597940	Three steps in the right direction because they're going to need to market the hell out
2597940	2602920	of this thing to convince people, here's why you need to spend $600 on this.
2602920	2609160	Well, you said it right there, and I mean, even the most fanboy of Sony has to admit,
2609160	2616500	you know, Sony needs to show us and the casual gamer why you want to spend $600 on this system,
2616500	2617500	so they do need to put it out.
2617500	2622480	It should be demoing Blu-ray movies and some hot trailers of PS3 exclusives, put some Metal
2622480	2626040	Gear Solid demos on there, you know, something like that, and really sell the hell out of
2626040	2628480	your system, and that might help you.
2628480	2633740	Well, actually, this is sort of related to something actually that was just given to
2633740	2637640	me not a few moments ago from our chat room, if that's fine.
2637640	2638640	Sure.
2638640	2646840	PSM got an actual PlayStation Magazine got an actual fully functional PS3 console delivered
2646840	2647840	to them.
2647840	2648840	Hmm.
2648840	2649840	That's not too surprising.
2649840	2653440	Well, yeah, it is PSM, so that makes sense.
2653440	2658820	But I think it's pretty funny that they, you know, they're actually starting to get these
2658820	2662460	out now to, you know, I guess they're VIPs.
2662460	2666480	They shouldn't have sent it without games because, you know, they said, you know, the
2666480	2670880	PS3, you'll buy it even if it doesn't have games because it's PlayStation.
2670880	2674480	There's a reflection of MotorStorm showing on the console in this picture.
2674480	2676720	It's pretty, pretty fun.
2676720	2677720	Hmm.
2677720	2688480	But anyway, as far as other systems coming out, Walmart, yes, everybody's favorite, you
2688480	2692000	know, low-price store of crappy goods.
2692000	2695560	Hey, but don't laugh at my picture.
2695560	2697280	I get decent stuff there once in a while.
2697280	2698960	It's not my favorite place to shop, but, you know.
2698960	2699960	I got the best shirt there.
2699960	2702560	It says, I love pirates and has a pirate ship on the butt.
2702560	2708360	But anyway, Walmart is considering not using the Wii demo station at their stores because
2708360	2716600	of the risk of a child or consumer using the Wii mote like a real nunchuck.
2716600	2717600	It's just stupid.
2717600	2726800	Do they have that little faith in the quality of their patrons that they're going, oh, we're
2726800	2730200	going to go hitting each other with the Wii mote?
2730200	2732320	Have you been to Walmart recently?
2732320	2733320	Yes.
2733320	2736960	I mean, maybe it's not so far off.
2736960	2738360	Maybe it is something you need to consider.
2738360	2742080	But I'm thinking, they've had the iToy for PS2 demoed there and that's one of those games
2742080	2744240	that encourages you to flap your arms about.
2744240	2749600	Flapping, hitting somebody with your hand, you know, just by accident is a lot different
2749600	2752240	than smacking somebody in the head with a piece of hard plastic.
2752240	2756200	Yeah, but won't they have the hard plastic on some type of chain or it's only going to
2756200	2758640	have a limited range anyway?
2758640	2764760	I don't give the, you know, corporate powers that be at Walmart that much mental.
2764760	2768440	You're going to end up getting broken or stolen.
2768440	2774400	I honestly am not surprised, but that just means that people will go to places other
2774400	2776520	than Walmart to buy their Wii, won't it?
2776520	2778960	Not really, because you may not have an option in some parts of the nation.
2778960	2782720	People will just go to other parts, you know, other stores to demo the Wii and they can
2782720	2786000	buy it at Walmart because they're the low-priced leader, of course.
2786000	2788440	They're also the low-quality leader, too.
2788440	2789440	Hi, Walmart!
2789440	2792880	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Launch Radio do not pass.
2792880	2798080	The one good thing about Walmart is that when I lived in Alabama, Super Walmart was open
2798080	2803040	24 hours and I had somewhere to go when I was bored, other than Denny's.
2803040	2804040	Wow.
2804040	2805040	Walmart.
2805040	2806040	You know what?
2806040	2807040	When I was in college in Chico, it was the same thing.
2807040	2810160	We'd go to Walmart because we were bored and they were open 24 hours.
2810160	2811160	Sad.
2811160	2812680	Basically, this is before I even heard of Eddie Izzard.
2812680	2816160	We would do the Eddie Izzard Theory of Shopping, where you just grab stuff, move it around,
2816160	2820040	and then leave, because that's illegal!
2820040	2826280	Anyways, some other stores that I used to like to go to at least as a kid, Toys R Us.
2826280	2827800	What happened to Toys R Us?
2827800	2828800	So sad.
2828800	2829800	Really?
2829800	2832680	I actually sometimes do my gaming shopping there.
2832680	2835880	They have Jeffrey Chang in the basement.
2835880	2842440	Combine Kids R Us and Toys R Us and Babies R Us, it's less Toys R Us and more Toddler
2842440	2843440	Craft.
2843440	2844440	Pampers.
2844440	2847980	Well, they still have a pretty decent video gaming section, I've got to say, and if you've
2847980	2851360	ever been to Toys R Us and Times Square, it's hot.
2851360	2852840	Some of those big, big Toys R Us's are hot.
2852840	2854200	Okay, well I haven't been there.
2854200	2859560	But anyways, one of the things that they had, of course, is their holiday list of must-have
2859560	2865080	items, and of course, on the list was the Nintendo Wii.
2865080	2866080	What wasn't on the list?
2866080	2867180	The PlayStation 3.
2867180	2869440	The reason behind this is a couple things.
2869440	2875560	One, the PlayStation 3 is really geared towards savvy gaming enthusiasts, whereas the Nintendo
2875560	2881000	Wii is basically going to appeal to young kids as well, as adults.
2881000	2885640	The other thing is, one of their criteria for making this list is knowing that they're
2885640	2892640	going to have a sufficient stock for the item during the holiday season, which we know that
2892640	2896720	the PlayStation 3, that will not be the case.
2896720	2897720	Very interesting.
2897720	2903200	I do see this, I think the Wii would kind of mesh very well with Toys R Us.
2903200	2906000	It seems to be the same kind of clientele.
2906000	2910560	Alright, well as Loki was saying, part of the reason that Toys R Us maybe put the Wii
2910560	2913480	on their list is that they're not expecting to have a shortage.
2913480	2918960	Nintendo has confirmed they are going to be shipping one million units of the Wii in North
2918960	2924360	America on November 19th, and when I say North America, that means US and Canada, so you
2924360	2928320	Canadians will get some lovin' from Nintendo too, so no worries.
2928320	2932600	Because actually the news came from Nintendo of Canada's Vice President, saying we're looking
2932600	2937320	at a million units for North America at launch.
2937320	2941800	You may remember that previously our dear friend Reggie said that four million Wiis will
2941800	2947320	be out by the end of the year, the majority of them for North America, and now it's confirmed
2947320	2952000	that about one million are going to hit North America.
2952000	2953920	And I'm expecting probably another million by the end of the year.
2953920	2957960	Now there was a late update that suggests that perhaps there might even be more than
2957960	2962220	a million that hit on launch day, because you know what I'm thinking, with as huge as
2962220	2965520	people are expecting this to be, a million may not be enough.
2965520	2967880	I would still think they're going to be sold out.
2967880	2971400	Even with a million, they're going to be sold out some places.
2971400	2974760	I think they're going to be sold out no matter what, but at least they're going to have
2974760	2978320	a million units, and a million is a good number to put out there.
2978320	2983400	It's a safe number instead of saying, we're going to have four billion units at launch,
2983400	2988120	just shipping only four, you know?
2988120	2989120	I don't know.
2989120	2990520	It should be pretty cool.
2990520	2993800	Some of the cool stuff about the Wii, though, came out this week.
2993800	2998240	So talking a little bit about some of the Wii channels, including the Wii message board
2998240	3003120	and the new one that I haven't heard of at least, Play History, which Play History is
3003120	3009780	going to be sort of similar to the, kind of like what the 360 has, where you can see the
3009780	3012600	games that people have played and stuff.
3012600	3016480	But I think they're even going to go into greater detail with that, because originally
3016480	3021200	the Play History was supposed to be a way for parents to be able to limit the amount
3021200	3023200	of gaming kids would have.
3023200	3026800	So you'd be able to shut the console off after a certain amount of hours and stuff.
3026800	3030520	Apparently that didn't work out too well, so this came to be instead.
3030520	3036320	So Play History will actually be, you know, charting a bunch of different stats, of course,
3036320	3039160	the majority being your game playing time.
3039160	3044400	Now the Wii message board is kind of like a little mini, almost email or message board
3044400	3045480	system.
3045480	3050400	You can leave messages for other people that use the Wii, as well as send those messages
3050400	3055840	to mobile phones and, you know, I would imagine PCs and email and that type of stuff.
3055840	3061920	Plus, certain games, say like Animal Crossing, may send you messages as well, you know, so
3061920	3067880	you'd be getting the emails or the mail from Animal Crossing in your message board.
3067880	3069400	So it's kind of neat.
3069400	3073240	You know, this whole Play History thing is very interesting to me.
3073240	3078320	So in other words, like, if I'm staying up past my bedtime to play the Wii, if I'm a
3078320	3082560	savvy enough parent, I can go in there and see that, you know, my kid's been up past
3082560	3086800	his bedtime playing the Wii, and I can take the cord or, you know, something away.
3086800	3087800	I don't know.
3087800	3088800	That's kind of interesting.
3088800	3089800	What do you guys think about that?
3089800	3092240	Is that a good thing or is that, sure, you know?
3092240	3095960	Yeah, I think that's a good thing because, you know what, parents need the tools.
3095960	3099680	If they are having trouble monitoring their, you know, the amount of gaming their kids
3099680	3103880	have and they want to, I think it's good that they're providing a way for them to be able
3103880	3104880	to do that.
3104880	3108180	And you know what, whether they use that or not, that's kind of up to them.
3108180	3110520	But at least Nintendo is providing you the tools.
3110520	3116700	Same thing with, like, the lockouts for different content based on the, you know, content ratings.
3116700	3120240	If they have those parental locks in place, at least they're providing them the tools,
3120240	3124280	you know, to be able to block that content from, you know, say their children that might
3124280	3125880	not be appropriate.
3125880	3129080	So I think it's good to give them the tools.
3129080	3133280	The controls should be put in the parent's hand for the content that their children sees.
3133280	3135400	I mean, that's responsible parroting.
3135400	3136400	Interesting.
3136400	3138940	What do you guys think about the fact that Nintendo is probably going to be tracking
3138940	3139940	what you play?
3139940	3141200	I mean, is that an invasion of privacy?
3141200	3142840	Well, I don't know if they are.
3142840	3143840	I mean...
3143840	3144840	It's the same.
3144840	3148000	Well, if it's tracking it in the play history, I mean, it's always connected to the Internet.
3148000	3150280	How do you feel about TiVo tracking what you watch?
3150280	3153000	I mean, I'm just, I actually, well, I'm just, I'm playing Devil's Advocate here.
3153000	3155400	I don't think it's a big deal because 360 does the same thing.
3155400	3156400	You know it does.
3156400	3157400	Who cares?
3157400	3159880	Because you can see the last five games you've played and it's, you know, I'm sure...
3159880	3163720	Unless they come out with, like, you know, some nasty ass porn games, you know, then
3163720	3164720	whatever.
3164720	3165720	Who cares?
3165720	3166720	Who cares?
3166720	3167720	So they know what I'm playing.
3167720	3168720	Big deal.
3168720	3169720	Okay.
3169720	3170720	I don't know.
3170720	3171720	Just curious.
3171720	3177000	I, I do think that there is an advantage in checking it in terms of, especially if you've
3177000	3181920	got your general region in terms of demographics, they'll know what games are being played more
3181920	3186120	in what areas, who to market to, what to market.
3186120	3192520	I actually think that if they use it for their, you know, for their sales, from a sales perspective,
3192520	3198720	it can really increase their profit by gearing toward the different audiences, seeing who's
3198720	3200640	playing the most of what.
3200640	3201640	Yeah.
3201640	3202640	Interesting.
3202640	3203640	Ooh.
3203640	3206320	Tarktitsia says, Gals panic on Xbox Live Arcade.
3206320	3209640	I can only hope someday.
3209640	3216220	Mecklar in our chat room says, the good point of it is that if a first party game is popular,
3216220	3217480	we get more of them.
3217480	3221760	So but yeah, but don't they already track that through sales in a way if a game is popular?
3221760	3222760	Not necessarily.
3222760	3223760	I think.
3223760	3224760	Yeah.
3224760	3225760	They track through sales.
3225760	3226760	Hmm.
3226760	3228600	I, but sales doesn't tell you exactly who's playing what.
3228600	3229600	It would be an interesting comparison.
3229600	3232760	You know, sure, people bought this, but how long are they actually playing it?
3232760	3233760	See, that's my point.
3233760	3235760	Before they sold it back to GameStop.
3235760	3236760	That's my point.
3236760	3240680	I think if you see what type of games have the most playability, what's going to have
3240680	3247120	the most longevity, then they're going to be able to say, okay, well, we put this here
3247120	3252960	and then we say, do you want to keep renewing your experience on this game here is X add
3252960	3254260	on.
3254260	3255400	You know what I just realized?
3255400	3258520	Nintendo's already tracking what games you play on the DS because if you go to Nintendo
3258520	3263480	Wi-Fi.com, it shows the most popular Wi-Fi games and the last 20 people that played them
3263480	3264480	and everything.
3264480	3269320	So Nintendo's been quote unquote violating your privacy in that way for some time, but
3269320	3270320	I don't think it's a big deal.
3270320	3272440	I think violating privacy is posting your pictochat.
3272440	3273440	Yeah.
3273440	3275760	You know, having big pictures of like a bunch of cocks.
3275760	3280880	Or if I moon one of our listeners on Uno on Xbox Live Arcade, I wouldn't want Microsoft
3280880	3281880	to post that on the interweb.
3281880	3284240	Free on Xbox Live, Rob's ass.
3284240	3287000	Send it as your background.
3287000	3289520	It's a theme that you can download this week.
3289520	3291240	I would not download the Rob's ass theme, sorry.
3291240	3294120	I would not allow it to be distributed.
3294120	3297040	Anyway, this is something much more exciting.
3297040	3301560	I squeed like a little girl and probably did run around the house naked when I read this
3301560	3302560	news.
3302560	3303560	DMN wants to see your ass.
3303560	3307160	When I saw this and I posted it, I knew that you'd be squeaking like a little girl.
3307160	3309880	This made me squeal like a little girl.
3309880	3313040	There's a rumor out there, I don't know if it's rumor or fact or what's going on, but
3313040	3317880	Commodore 64 is supposed to be joining the Wii Virtual Console lineup.
3317880	3323560	I played so much, like Commodore 64 was my gaming system in that period between the 2600
3323560	3325280	and the NES for me.
3325280	3328280	Like oh my god, this makes me so happy.
3328280	3333880	Gamasutra is reporting that the Virtual Console update says that no game titles are specified
3333880	3338520	but there are indications that classic epics titles, games like California Games, Summer
3338520	3343320	Games, Impossible Mission, and Jumpman may make an appearance.
3343320	3344720	I love you, my Jumpman.
3344720	3349600	Oh god, the announcement is a matter of time before they announce like M-U-L-E, Pinball
3349600	3350600	Construction.
3350600	3354360	Jumpman was my game on the Coleco, that's what I used to play all the time.
3354360	3359360	Well now what's interesting is that when Kotaku posted this story, one of their chat commenters
3359360	3361460	posted this interesting update.
3361460	3366180	They wrote to say that Nintendo Power, where this was also ran, I guess is where most people
3366180	3371460	picked this up from, the editors were speculating that Commodore 64 games will hit Virtual Console
3371460	3374960	land and that a handful of epics games were being reworked for the Wii.
3374960	3379460	Quote, a Nintendo Power editor merely speculated the announced Commodore 64 games would come
3379460	3384620	to the Virtual Console when in fact two were being remade for the PSP, DS, and Wii.
3384620	3389860	To quote, System 3 will release Impossible Mission on the PSP and DS in January of 07,
3389860	3393640	three weeks later it will come to Wii, with California Games for PSP and DS in May of
3393640	3396840	07, and again three weeks later it will come to the Wii.
3396840	3397840	Huh.
3397840	3401600	You know, either way, no matter where these games are coming, I'm just really excited
3401600	3407220	to see some Commodore 64 love in this era of gaming because damn I loved me some Impossible
3407220	3409860	Mission, although that game was impossible as fuck.
3409860	3412780	It was called Impossible Mission for a reason, it was so hard.
3412780	3415620	I want the old Apple IIe games.
3415620	3416620	Like Oregon Trail?
3416620	3417620	Yeah.
3417620	3418620	Are you waiting for Oregon Trail to come to Virtual Console?
3418620	3419620	Gnarly Golf.
3419620	3421940	And I want old school kicks.
3421940	3427580	That was my favorite game, Gnarly Golf, on the Apple IIe, and yes, I did play Apple way
3427580	3434060	back in the day when that was the only option for actual gaming, which is ironic, I mean.
3434060	3439340	I still sometimes dust off the Atari 5200 just to play kicks.
3439340	3441260	That's pretty cool.
3441260	3445500	Alright, well, you know, with all this Wii Virtual Console news, I'm sure someday you'll
3445500	3450340	be able to send us messages on the Wii and they'll come up on our screen, but for the
3450340	3455180	time being, we have our old fashioned mailbag and it's email, and every week you send us
3455180	3460180	emails and Dark Sakura goes in there in her hazmat suit and pulls out a few of her favorites
3460180	3461620	to share with you folks.
3461620	3466340	So when you send email to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, it might just get read
3466340	3471180	on the air, like we're going to read some right now, right, Dark Sakura?
3471180	3472580	Absolutely.
3472580	3479380	Well, my actual favorite email out of this lot came from Warrior Bob, but it's really,
3479380	3484860	really freaking long, so if you don't mind, I'm going to post it up on the forums because
3484860	3486700	it is really long.
3486700	3490380	You know, just really long emails get posted on the forum, how about that?
3490380	3492540	Anyway, got one from Mekar.
3492540	3497300	Wait, was the Warrior Bob one, the really long one, and then like, he's talking about
3497300	3502900	the next gen gaming, and then at the very end it says, so in conclusion, Buy Right Sucks.
3502900	3505060	That's exactly what it says, in conclusion, Buy Right Sucks.
3505060	3508500	That made me crack up when I read it.
3508500	3512420	But I like this last line though, I can assure you that years from now I'll still be playing
3512420	3515740	something really, really old alongside my newest, shiniest game.
3515740	3519260	I actually should put that out there, we're no longer going to be asking your permission
3519260	3523780	to post your letters, if you send us something to Orange Lounge Radio's mailbag, here or
3523780	3526860	on out, you've been warned, we might post it on our forums.
3526860	3532500	But out of respect, unless you want us to, we will post nicknames but not real names.
3532500	3533500	Yeah, yeah.
3533500	3534500	To protect the not-so-innocent.
3534500	3541100	Anyway, Mekar wrote in, I started listening to Orange Lounge Radio last week on your 200th
3541100	3545100	episode, I must say it was my first podcast and I haven't laughed so much in ages.
3545100	3548620	God, what a one to have as your first one.
3548620	3552900	Just to say thanks for putting out a great show and it's nice to see a US show mentioning
3552900	3553900	the UK.
3553900	3558900	I also have to admit that you guys were responsible for me purchasing an Xbox 360, I'd heard of
3558900	3562260	some okay stuff about it but hearing all the good stuff you guys were saying about Saints
3562260	3565340	Row and Dead Rising got me interested.
3565340	3571260	The live arcade information sold me, so on Friday I went out and spent the 365 pounds
3571260	3577820	on 360 and Dead Rising and Saints Row, I'm so happy I got it, it rules, so thanks guys.
3577820	3581940	Didn't they just slice the price by five pounds, so a 360 would be 360 pounds?
3581940	3582940	That'd be funny.
3582940	3588900	Yeah, I know, I mean come on, it's five pounds, which I realize is like seven or eight bucks
3588900	3595860	US, but still it's not that much, but I mean that's a very nice compliment that somebody
3595860	3601420	would go out and make that kind of investment based on what we've said, it's even more so
3601420	3605460	the investment in the UK because things are more expensive over there, so that's a very
3605460	3606460	nice compliment.
3606460	3610180	It's very interesting since it's all lies!
3610180	3612180	We love the 360.
3612180	3613180	What?
3613180	3618780	Our next email doesn't actually have a nickname on it, so I'm just going to say it's from
3618780	3619780	Sean.
3619780	3625780	Hello, OLR, I wanted to first wish all of you a happy belated 200th episode, I've been
3625780	3630180	listening to your show for forever but haven't really interacted until just now, just felt
3630180	3633220	like thanking you guys for being awesome.
3633220	3635820	I saw you guys at B3 and everything, you guys are the best.
3635820	3642020	Anyway, just wanted to know, excuse me, what your thoughts are on microtransactions and
3642020	3646860	games in general, and also an opinion on the news that Gran Turismo HD will be almost entirely
3646860	3652620	microtransaction based, costing only the cost of the disc and packaging, but with the premium
3652620	3655420	mode having a few tracks and cars available from the start.
3655420	3659220	My opinion, it defeats the purpose of having the game to begin with, as I always play the
3659220	3663500	Gran Turismo games to rack up huge amounts of money, unlock new tracks and cars and whatnots
3663500	3668300	and just have fun, I don't want to have to actively make purchasing decisions for a game,
3668300	3671020	I just want to pay my 50 to 60 bucks and be done with it.
3671020	3676020	And while I understand that this is a popular trend in Korean MMOs such as MapleStory and
3676020	3681460	Pangya Golf, those games actually have content that you can earn which makes playing them
3681460	3686700	fun and having the purchasable items as a bonus to look cool only.
3686700	3691240	I want to be able to earn cars just like I've been doing for the last 4 GTs instead of their
3691240	3694260	new version of a game where you play it only for a few minutes a day.
3694260	3697500	I just wanted to know your thoughts on it and let you know that you guys rock and I
3697500	3700000	hope you keep podcasting into the future, thanks.
3700000	3701000	Thank you.
3701000	3705940	I think this is funny, Haz in our chat room says, micro-rape-men is more like it.
3705940	3710580	I do have to say the microtransaction thing for a racing game, I was going back and thinking
3710580	3716740	about it, you know, and if it's trying to, the point of Gran Turismo was the point of
3716740	3721140	putting you into a realistic racing situation, right?
3721140	3725580	Well if you are a professional racer, you are going to go out and spend money to buy
3725580	3729860	your cars, to buy your upgraded parts, you are going to go shopping.
3729860	3736620	If the point of Gran Turismo is to reflect the more realistic side of racing, then that
3736620	3738800	makes sense.
3738800	3744260	I'm okay with microtransactions, I think in certain types of games and certain ways that
3744260	3745900	it's used, it's actually pretty cool.
3745900	3751040	For instance, new songs in DDR and Karaoke Revolution and those games, new maps and shooter
3751040	3755860	games like Halo 2, in fact I really like the way Halo 2 did it where for a while it was
3755860	3759660	pay and then it was free, but of course I'm going to love anything that's free.
3759660	3761660	I think it's good for new tracks and things.
3761660	3769180	For me it's about, when I buy the initial game, you know, if the game cost me 50 bucks
3769180	3775760	or 60 bucks, am I getting 50 or 60 bucks worth of game or are you relying on microtransactions
3775760	3778020	to be the full experience of the game?
3778020	3780820	This is where that Gran Turismo thing really worries me.
3780820	3786300	If they're only going to charge me 20 bucks for the game and give me a couple tracks and
3786300	3792340	a couple cars, then that might be okay, but don't go charging me 60 bucks for no game
3792340	3795860	and then expect me to buy all these microtransactions.
3795860	3798580	It's got to be worth what I'm paying for them.
3798580	3800220	Some of these microtransactions are a joke.
3800220	3806680	I'm not going to pay for new costumes, especially when they are inspired by commercial things
3806680	3809340	that should be taken care of at a sponsorship.
3809340	3815580	They need to do it like Test Drive Unlimited I think is doing it, where the game is cheap
3815580	3819300	because they knew right away that there's going to be lots of microtransactions, but
3819300	3822940	you do not need to buy them to be able to enjoy the game.
3822940	3827900	The way they're making Gran Turismo HD sound, oh by the way, if you want to play online,
3827900	3830340	you've got to buy the cars first.
3830340	3833660	So that's kind of fucked up, I think, right there.
3833660	3836260	So why am I buying this game again?
3836260	3841220	And to be honest, I've seen the video of Gran Turismo HD, apparently the premium one or
3841220	3842220	whatever.
3842220	3847060	I'm not impressed by it at all, and I think it would be a waste of money to buy it.
3847060	3849980	But you know what, if you're a huge fan of Gran Turismo, then yeah, go ahead and purchase
3849980	3850980	that game.
3850980	3855860	But I think it's a mistake to expect you to purchase cars before you can race online.
3855860	3857020	I think that's dumb.
3857020	3861520	I think that you should be able to have a sponsor on your car, and then you don't have
3861520	3862520	to pay.
3862520	3863940	That's an interesting way to do it.
3863940	3866380	Your sponsor pays for your purchase.
3866380	3867380	Interesting.
3867380	3869980	I want to read some quick comments from chat room.
3869980	3874380	Mecklar from our chat room says, microtransaction items should only be there for after the game
3874380	3875380	has been completed.
3875380	3876380	Exactly.
3876380	3877460	That's a good thought.
3877460	3881020	Jeremy Todd 1 says, it's the same thing with Luminous for the 360 arcade.
3881020	3883180	You have to buy different game modes, and that might...
3883180	3884180	That is retarded.
3884180	3885180	That might even scare...
3885180	3888220	I mean, well, we haven't really seen the final, final, what it's really going to be yet, but
3888220	3891260	that might scare me off from Luminous on 360.
3891260	3895780	I think Joystiq reviewed it at X06 and didn't exactly have the brightest things to say about
3895780	3896780	that, which is a little disappointing.
3896780	3901420	I liked it when I played it at E3, but it's going to come down to what am I going to get
3901420	3903300	for the base price.
3903300	3907380	I'm not going to buy the game just to have to microtransaction it out to really get the
3907380	3909060	full feel out of it.
3909060	3913580	Well, to move on to our next email, unless we've got anything more to add.
3913580	3914580	Not really.
3914580	3915580	Oh, wait.
3915580	3916580	Here's one interesting chat comment.
3916580	3920900	Bandit says, what if you could earn real life gas for your car by winning races in Turismo?
3920900	3922460	Not likely.
3922460	3924060	Not likely, but it would be an interesting tie-in.
3924060	3928100	See, I think what they should do if they really want to have realism in the game is that you
3928100	3933620	actually earn actual, well, not actual, but comparable money in their game environment
3933620	3940820	and have to pay for your gas and pay your crew and pay to buy your new stuff.
3940820	3942420	That should be how they do it.
3942420	3945340	One more quick chat comment and then we'll let DarkSucker get to the next email.
3945340	3949300	FootyMonster says, if the game is going to be gimped because you don't have the extra
3949300	3951140	content, then that's wrong.
3951140	3954300	What you got off the shelves should be enough to enjoy.
3954300	3955300	I agree.
3955300	3960180	Also, I'd like to give FootyMonster a big hello for listening in from Argentina.
3960180	3961660	We love our worldwide audience.
3961660	3962660	Absolutely.
3962660	3965500	We love our domestic audience, too, but we love the worldwide audience as well.
3965500	3968060	Our next one comes from Matt.
3968060	3969060	Hey, O-R-L.
3969060	3970060	Oh, really?
3970060	3971060	Oh, really.
3971060	3977860	Long time listener to your great podcast, but this is my first time writing in.
3977860	3982180	I just got done writing Xbox about how disappointed I was when I attempted playing UNO for the
3982180	3985920	first time since they added that god-awful contraption called The Vision.
3985920	3987800	Never have I been so appalled.
3987800	3991700	If seeing underage boys showing their Wii and masturbating wasn't enough, I actually
3991700	3994780	saw this one guy shooting up an unknown drug.
3994780	3997420	Why is Microsoft allowing this behavior to happen?
3997420	3998420	That's awesome.
3998420	3999420	It's really discredited.
3999420	4000420	Let me finish.
4000420	4004780	It's really discrediting them as a serious game platform anymore.
4004780	4009200	I guess with Sony's and Microsoft's recent bad management decisions, I guess I'll have
4009200	4015380	to trade them Xbox 360 and pre-order the only Wii that I want to see and play with, Nintendo's
4015380	4016380	new system.
4016380	4019900	At least I know that they wouldn't allow this type of behavior to happen on their network.
4019900	4021420	Please let me know what you guys think of this.
4021420	4023260	Thanks, and keep up the great work.
4023260	4027500	Whenever there is a camera peripheral, you can better believe you're going to see someone
4027500	4028500	naked.
4028500	4029940	That is just the fact.
4029940	4030940	You know what?
4030940	4031940	That's nothing that they have control over.
4031940	4036220	I don't want to see some frickin' 16 or 17-year-old person running around naked on their camera.
4036220	4037220	That's illegal.
4037220	4038220	Hello?
4038220	4040220	That's not okay.
4040220	4041220	That's non-consensual.
4041220	4044740	I'm being raped with these images.
4044740	4046420	Here's the other thing too.
4046420	4047420	Why the hell?
4047420	4048700	Here's what they should have.
4048700	4053180	They should have an option for each player, if you do not want to view that, that you
4053180	4054180	can shut the window off.
4054180	4055180	I think they do.
4055180	4056180	Don't they?
4056180	4057180	I'm not sure.
4057180	4058820	I don't have the camera still, so you've got to tell me.
4058820	4059820	I don't know.
4059820	4063100	I've seen Uno once on live with the camera.
4063100	4068660	Well, what you can do is that inside 360's system, you can warn, and you can do either
4068660	4072780	the rep damaging thing, where you say, I want to avoid this player and why, and it damages
4072780	4075360	their star rating, and I'm not afraid to use that.
4075360	4079980	I use that all the time on people who sit there when I'm playing Uno, and there's that
4079980	4084900	kid going, ah, ah, ah.
4084900	4085900	You know what?
4085900	4087220	I'm just like, shut the fuck up.
4087220	4088220	Bandits got it.
4088220	4090180	Where are the parents?
4090180	4091980	Probably shooting up dress queue.
4091980	4092980	Here's the thing.
4092980	4093980	Here's the thing.
4093980	4098700	What you need to do, report it, because there's that, and then there's the notify Microsoft
4098700	4103380	about this, and Microsoft supposedly is going to monitor this, and hopefully they really
4103380	4106580	will, because they're supposed to do it with the audio, and wouldn't that be something
4106580	4111700	if suddenly the account gets suspended, the Xbox Live account, and something happens with
4111700	4115180	the credit card, either there's a refund, and so suddenly the parents will find out
4115180	4116180	about it.
4116180	4119780	Johnny, why did you get banned from Xbox Live?
4119780	4120780	I don't know.
4120780	4121780	They're here!
4121780	4123920	Eddie says it's probably in the parental controls.
4123920	4127660	Also at-deaf says, I can star rate you, and I'm not afraid to use it.
4127660	4128660	You know what, though?
4128660	4132340	I still think it makes Uno edgier.
4132340	4136140	It makes me want to play it more because of the naked chicks.
4136140	4139860	But they're, that's gross, because some of them are like 16 and 17.
4139860	4140860	What are you going to do?
4140860	4142780	Ask each one, you know, when they're about to take their top off?
4142780	4143780	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4143780	4144780	Yay, team.
4144780	4145780	Sure I am.
4145780	4146780	Continue.
4146780	4147780	Continue.
4147780	4152180	I don't, you know, I don't know.
4152180	4153180	Come on.
4153180	4154180	There's a difference between someone.
4154180	4155180	They don't care.
4155180	4159420	There's a difference between someone flashing their butt really quick and someone like jerking
4159420	4160420	it off on camera.
4160420	4161420	That's disgusting.
4161420	4162420	Microsoft.
4162420	4164940	If I want to see that, there's websites I can go to for that, okay?
4164940	4165940	Microsoft does not care.
4165940	4172540	I mean, after all, they have the triggers which make the controller vibrate to, as they
4172540	4176780	put it, to wake up the other person because, yeah, also they're going to go comatose once
4176780	4177780	they start chatting.
4177780	4178780	We know how to wake them up.
4178780	4179780	You know, in video chat.
4179780	4180780	Bullshit, okay?
4180780	4186060	That thing, they have one trigger for vibrating slowly, one trigger for vibrating, you know,
4186060	4187460	at a more rapid pace.
4187460	4188460	Come on.
4188460	4190660	What do you think they made that for?
4190660	4191660	Trance controller?
4191660	4196740	You know, maybe our particular emailer here has just been lucky, quote, unquote, in what
4196740	4198020	they've been seeing.
4198020	4200900	Wonder Dog Harold in our chat room says, I've been playing tons of Uno and I haven't seen
4200900	4201900	anything obscene.
4201900	4202900	Exactly.
4202900	4205100	I haven't, well, I played one game with Uno and I haven't, that wasn't a thing.
4205100	4209180	I've seen like one person using a camera and that's it, you know, I just don't see any
4209180	4210180	cameras on there.
4210180	4212020	I think it's funny when I see cameras because usually they're pointing at really weird things
4212020	4214500	like someone's cat, you know, just like fun stuff.
4214500	4217980	Dude, we should put Shermie on the camera.
4217980	4221100	My cat would, her nose would take up the whole thing.
4221100	4222100	My cat's so fat.
4222100	4225900	Well, I'm sorry to hear to our emailer that they're having to see all that crap because
4225900	4227860	not everybody wants to see that, okay?
4227860	4231700	I definitely use the 360's warrant system and seriously, if you see somebody shooting
4231700	4234820	up drugs on the frickin', you know, even if they're trying to joke about it, just frickin'
4234820	4237580	warrant, do the ultra-warn thing that notifies Microsoft.
4237580	4238580	That's not cool.
4238580	4239580	And why are people just like leading the games and stuff?
4239580	4244380	If you see some like, you know, preteen masturbating on camera, why are people like kicking them
4244380	4248020	out of the game or just, you know, saying, fuck this, I'm out of here, you know?
4248020	4250420	I guess that's one option, host your own games.
4250420	4252140	Look, boobies.
4252140	4255780	That's a good option, host your own games and then you have control over booting people
4255780	4257340	out when they're doing something stupid.
4257340	4259140	So things to think about.
4259140	4267900	We got an email from Bradley, who is a pretty awesome person, actually was talking about
4267900	4275580	the guy at Kingdom Hearts Fan Club and was getting the word out regarding this petition
4275580	4276580	going around.
4276580	4278560	I actually think this is a pretty cool thing.
4278560	4286800	They're talking about how Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix is coming out, but what's coming
4286800	4294180	out with it is that Chain of Memories remake for the PS2, which we may not get.
4294180	4302100	There's a petition going around now at KHInsider.com.
4302100	4309700	The link there will say KH2FM plus COM, petition contact campaign.
4309700	4313980	Just wanting to get the Chain of Memories remake released out here.
4313980	4319860	It's showing interest to Sony, to Squeenix, actually, that gamers in the U.S. wants it.
4319860	4321900	So I said I'd make a mention.
4321900	4325060	Maybe it's something they could pack in with Kingdom Hearts 3 in the future?
4325060	4326060	I don't know.
4326060	4327060	A stretch?
4327060	4328060	I don't know.
4328060	4332940	I think they should do a $20 release and say, here you go, here's Chain of Memories.
4332940	4337260	Oh, like when they release it as a budget game, maybe throw that in as a pack-in?
4337260	4338260	Not necessarily that.
4338260	4340940	I'm just saying maybe release it as a standalone budget game.
4340940	4341940	That would be cool.
4341940	4342940	I would pay for it.
4342940	4346020	I've been playing Chain of Memories on my micro.
4346020	4347020	I'd be interested to see.
4347020	4349820	Chain of Memories is a pain in the ass to play on the micro, by the way.
4349820	4351940	I'll be honest, I haven't really played Chain of Memories at all.
4351940	4355020	I kind of skipped it, but I would check it out.
4355020	4361260	I don't do a lot of gaming on Game Boy Advance, especially games of that length.
4361260	4362260	I don't know.
4362260	4365320	They're just more TV games for me, so I would definitely check it out if it was on PlayStation
4365320	4366320	2.
4366320	4367320	So I'd like to see that.
4367320	4368320	I'll sign it.
4368320	4371140	I'd just probably import it, but that's me.
4371140	4372140	You know me.
4372140	4374140	I've got one from Jeremy Todd 1.
4374140	4375140	Hi.
4375140	4376140	Hey, OLR.
4376140	4377620	It's Jeremy Todd 1, like I just said.
4377620	4380660	I haven't sent an email in for a while, so why don't I send one now?
4380660	4381660	I don't know.
4381660	4382660	Why don't you?
4382660	4386540	He's been getting a lot of face time tonight with the comments and everything, but that's
4386540	4387540	fine.
4387540	4391660	Did you ever think that Microsoft and the makers of the games is ripping us off with
4391660	4392780	the arcade games?
4392780	4395460	I've been thinking about it, and seriously, it's a rip-off.
4395460	4396900	An example is Uno.
4396900	4401460	I bought Uno a week or two ago, and then today I went on Windows Live Messenger, the newest
4401460	4405740	version of MSN Messenger, and then a friend wanted to play a game, so I went to the games
4405740	4406860	list and saw Uno.
4406860	4411020	I opened it up, and it was exactly the same as the 360 arcade version.
4411020	4413660	It's the same freaking game for free.
4413660	4414660	What the hell?
4414660	4417620	So I paid five bucks for Uno, even though I can already play it for free with my friends
4417620	4419900	using MSN, bah.
4419900	4422300	And yes, I know I'm a sucker because I keep buying these games.
4422300	4424580	My name is Jeremy Todd 1, and I have a problem.
4424580	4428500	Yeah, but could you see your friend masturbating and shooting up drugs on MSN Messenger?
4428500	4429500	I think not.
4429500	4430500	That's plus.
4430500	4431500	No, seriously.
4431500	4438620	You know, you can play Zuma for free online, you can play Bejeweled for free online, yet
4438620	4440580	we're suckers for these games anyway.
4440580	4445160	They're pretty on the TV in a way that they're not in the little window in the computer,
4445160	4448700	and there's something to be said about the achievements in voice chat, multiplayer, and
4448700	4449700	all that crap.
4449700	4450780	I don't know.
4450780	4452100	We are suckers.
4452100	4453720	But five bucks isn't that much either.
4453720	4454720	It's really not.
4454720	4455720	For a game.
4455720	4459940	I could buy groceries with that, crackers and sardines for a week.
4459940	4463020	Yeah, you could buy like two boxes of Hot Pockets.
4463020	4464020	That's about it.
4464020	4465020	Hot Pockets.
4465020	4466020	Okay.
4466020	4467020	Two more emails left.
4467020	4469020	One's from Steven NZ.
4469020	4475420	Hey everyone, love the show like always, and before I start I know that my grammar is not
4475420	4476420	up to scratch, lol.
4476420	4477420	Oh, wait.
4477420	4478420	Hold on.
4478420	4479420	Can I say this one comment on the last email real quick?
4479420	4480420	No.
4480420	4481420	No, I'm sorry.
4481420	4482420	In chat, this is good.
4482420	4483420	I'm kidding.
4483420	4486020	Footy Monster says, Sky, it just makes it more accessible for everyone in the house.
4486020	4487020	Interesting perspective.
4487020	4488020	I just want to say that.
4488020	4489020	In regards to, you know.
4489020	4494580	To continue, I just wanted to ask you guys, which is better out of a Plasma or LCD TV
4494580	4495740	for gaming?
4495740	4498660	And we'll go ahead and ask that first question.
4498660	4501780	I have an LCD widescreen and I like it.
4501780	4508860	Plasma does have, well especially from having dealt with Plasma monitors for BeatMania,
4508860	4514460	they did sort of die after a while of constant use.
4514460	4517700	I was going to get into this in the FUs of the week.
4517700	4521860	I had a, I think it's CRT, is that what they call the big boxes?
4521860	4528420	I had a CRT, but I was forced to upgrade this week and I now have an LCD.
4528420	4529700	It's pretty.
4529700	4532140	I like LCD.
4532140	4533340	I'm getting used to it still.
4533340	4535380	The sound is bothering me on this new TV though.
4535380	4537560	I can't get it just right like I had on the old one.
4537560	4538560	So that's the only thing that's bothering me.
4538560	4539560	But the picture's pretty.
4539560	4540560	It's pretty.
4540560	4541560	Loki, what about you?
4541560	4542560	What do you have?
4542560	4543560	You have an LCD, right?
4543560	4544560	I have an LCD.
4544560	4548380	I actually didn't, to go ahead and continue, and this next question is probably more for
4548380	4552260	Loki, but I was wondering how long it would take for a stationary image to burn into an
4552260	4556180	HDMI Plasma screen as I don't want to damage my new TV.
4556180	4561780	I don't think Plasmas have the problem with burn-in anymore.
4561780	4562780	Not if you get a new one.
4562780	4565860	I remember the older ones having the issues with it.
4565860	4572500	Yeah, I don't think, I don't think it's really an issue anymore, but apparently pretty quick
4572500	4574620	from what I heard before.
4574620	4578120	But I don't think, like I said, I think they've fixed that now.
4578120	4581460	You know what I don't get, and I'll probably have some tech junkie sending me hate mail
4581460	4584580	over this, but oh well, projection televisions.
4584580	4586060	I don't like those at all.
4586060	4589140	Like the ones that look weird, if you're looking at it like too high or too low, they don't
4589140	4590140	look right.
4590140	4591780	Like I don't get those TVs at all.
4591780	4594260	I would never put one of those in my house, but I don't know.
4594260	4598700	I'm sure that's going to incite some hate mail, but I'm not a fan personally.
4598700	4599700	That's an opinion, people.
4599700	4605500	Although I have to say, I saw my first non-video game example of burn-in yesterday.
4605500	4609980	We went to the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum in San Francisco, and one of their
4609980	4613900	screens had major burn-in, because they play the same thing over and over about blowing
4613900	4616980	your cheeks up like Dizzy Gillespie.
4616980	4621740	To continue with email, I'm just all over the place today.
4621740	4622740	Last one comes from DMN.
4622740	4625900	Yes, we saved you for last.
4625900	4627780	Pet pet.
4627780	4634140	All the same people managing to get on this show in different ways, calls, chats, emails.
4634140	4637220	You know, if you're sitting at home going, why do all these people keep getting on the
4637220	4638220	show?
4638220	4639900	Well, you could send us an email and you could get on the show.
4639900	4641780	Just make sure it's intelligent.
4641780	4642780	Absolutely.
4642780	4643780	Hey, OLR.
4643780	4646820	It's always great to be able to listen to you guys.
4646820	4651020	I appreciate the opinions to which I generally agree with you guys upon keep up the good
4651020	4652020	work.
4652020	4653660	I do write, however, regarding Sony.
4653660	4657340	I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but in the past two console generations, we
4657340	4662780	can all agree that Sony has prevailed over the other competitors, PS1 over the N64 and
4662780	4671620	Saturn, not in Japan necessarily though, PS2 over the GameCube and Xbox and Dreamcast.
4671620	4675500	This reminds me a lot of Nintendo back in the 80s and 90s when they dominated with the
4675500	4677140	NES and Super NES.
4677140	4681340	We cannot forget that Nintendo released a poorly made portable system after that that
4681340	4687220	like Sony has with the PSP, and now they have gotten very much full of themselves when the
4687220	4691700	next console was due out in N64 for Nintendo and PS3 now for Sony.
4691700	4697980	Nintendo ended up being last in a pivotal generation for gaming with the 64.
4697980	4700780	Nintendo reeled from that blow for quite a while and are now taking a step in the right
4700780	4702860	direction and being innovative.
4702860	4705460	Mind I bash Sony a lot, but I do not want to see them fail.
4705460	4710460	I love the PS1 as well as the PS2, but I think that the fact that the two console generations
4710460	4715060	of success have gone to their heads and going to send them further downhill.
4715060	4720100	And the problem with that is that if the PS3 fails, Blu-ray is likely to and Sony will
4720100	4722620	have nothing back to fall on.
4722620	4729720	I hope Hirai, Stringer, and Kuraragi strongly think about their business plan for the PS3
4729720	4732900	because it might be the last thing that Sony ever does.
4732900	4735620	Thanks for reading and keep up the good work.
4735620	4738540	It's an interesting comparison to make, but the one problem I have with it is that the
4738540	4740620	PSP is no Virtual Boy.
4740620	4744540	I think the PSP is a much better system than the Virtual Boy was.
4744540	4746780	The Virtual Boy just had some fundamental problems with it.
4746780	4749140	The PSP is just kind of a different thing.
4749140	4754900	It's games and movies and music, but otherwise I certainly can get that whole the company
4754900	4759180	is getting cocky using a format they shouldn't be using on the next console that's coming
4759180	4762900	out with the whole cartridges and now Blu-ray.
4762900	4764020	That's the interesting comparison.
4764020	4767660	I don't know if I buy the whole PSP is on the same level as Virtual Boy so much.
4767660	4771540	Remember, Kuraragi eats crayons and wears a helmet.
4771540	4772540	Was that last email?
4772540	4773540	That was it.
4773540	4777100	And then you could send us an email as well, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
4777100	4778700	More news while we're running along this segment.
4778700	4782100	We still have DDR previews to get to, so let's run through the next bit of news.
4782100	4787900	Yes, and I'm sure this came as a first for everybody that heard it, but apparently there
4787900	4794680	was a press release done by Bethesda saying, guess what?
4794680	4800300	Elder Scrolls Oblivion is coming out on the PSP and PS3.
4800300	4801300	That's news to me.
4801300	4803860	I told you on this show well over there.
4803860	4807860	Well, I actually have the exact show episode, thank you very much, because I did the research
4807860	4808860	on that.
4808860	4809860	Did you?
4809860	4814180	We first mentioned that it was coming on the PlayStation 3, Episode 189, just to give you
4814180	4816800	an... and that was mentioned about three months ago.
4816800	4818780	That was mentioned as the launch title.
4818780	4826120	We did mention the PSP version, which I believe was the same episode as the PlayStation 3 one,
4826120	4829040	and also that the date would be April 07.
4829040	4831860	We mentioned that back on Episode 196.
4831860	4832860	Yeah, okay.
4832860	4833860	Not clear at all.
4833860	4837260	Yes, but we cannot confirm those rumors until it's on the cover of our magazine.
4837260	4838460	Yeah, exactly.
4838460	4843780	Once it gets posted to the... once it gets printed in the official PlayStation magazine,
4843780	4850140	thank you very much, 1UP.com, yeah, which I might add, okay, there is an article in
4850140	4855780	OPM that says, if any game is worth the price of a PlayStation 3, Oblivion is it.
4855780	4863020	Wow, that's retarded, because you can get Oblivion already on the Xbox 360, and yeah,
4863020	4866580	from the screenshots it looks the same, so why would I buy a PlayStation 3?
4866580	4871180	Well, isn't there supposed to be a new race in the PS3 version or something?
4871180	4872180	I don't think so.
4872180	4874380	Yeah, I thought I read something about that, that there's a new race in the PS3.
4874380	4875380	What did I do?
4875380	4876380	That's what I say about that.
4876380	4879140	But anyways, so yeah, that's cute.
4879140	4884700	Like two people in the chatroom almost simultaneously said, OLR should have a magazine.
4884700	4888220	If you want to buy us out of our day job, sure.
4888220	4890940	I have editorial experience and writing.
4890940	4893780	Again, if you want to buy us out of our day job, sure, it's a tie-up too.
4893780	4894780	Why?
4894780	4895780	Jamie's in college for this.
4895780	4896780	Give me a job.
4896780	4900740	Like I said earlier in the show, and I'm going to repeat this every single episode until
4900740	4907220	this actual story comes out somewhere else, full auto 2 on PSP in March.
4907220	4910020	You heard it here first.
4910020	4912020	You've got issues, Loki.
4912020	4917500	Well, as also in regards to people who have issues, as I mentioned, we all know Kuraragi
4917500	4921460	eats crayons, licks wall candy, wears a bicycle helmet.
4921460	4924380	Now he has earned himself a leash.
4924380	4930220	Yes, he has to be strapped to the playground so that he does not run off.
4930220	4940900	When he was asked if the rival consoles will outstrip Sony's PS3, Kuraragi said, we do
4940900	4943420	not care.
4943420	4948920	He did though admit that they are struggling with the Blu-ray drive production, but they're
4948920	4950140	wanting to resolve it.
4950140	4956020	Now I have to say though that Phil Harrison, I think that he also has issues with crayons.
4956020	4962180	He at least eats the wrappers on the crayons because when he was asked if they have a launch
4962180	4967220	lineup yet, to quote, we're at a fluid time when games are in final QA, but not out of
4967220	4969580	final QA, but we're close.
4969580	4975980	So in other words, no, you don't have to give the special boy answer.
4975980	4977300	Go back and eat your crayons.
4977300	4980740	We should just send Kuraragi and Harrison like some crayolas.
4980740	4981740	Do you want to?
4981740	4982740	Yeah.
4982740	4983740	Orange wins.
4983740	4984740	Okay.
4984740	4985740	Let's, let's figure out their address or whatever.
4985740	4986740	We'll send them some.
4986740	4987740	All right.
4987740	4988740	Here's some crayons for you to eat.
4988740	4989740	I think you ran out.
4989740	4990740	Oh God.
4990740	4991740	Stupid, stupid Sony.
4991740	4994460	I don't think he would get it.
4994460	4996380	I think he's too dumb for that stuff.
4996380	5000580	They just take our crayons.
5000580	5001580	Anyways.
5001580	5007220	So, you know, kind of, you know, pretty obvious things, you know, Kuraragi being a retard
5007220	5011940	and Final Fantasy banning more people, you know, it goes pretty much hand in hand as
5011940	5020040	obvious news stories, but yeah, 3000 more people were banned for modding in what I can
5020040	5025380	imagine is only the PC version and of course using third party tools and whatnot to do
5025380	5027660	all sorts of hackster stuff.
5027660	5028660	Yay.
5028660	5031720	3300 people gone.
5031720	5033780	Have a nice day.
5033780	5040880	Speaking of hacks and leaks, it's being said that Gears of War has been pirated and uploaded
5040880	5042560	to Usenet.
5042560	5048480	It's 7.2 gigs and 157 parts will take a long time to download.
5048480	5053020	The thing is it takes so long to download that nobody really knows if this is legitimate
5053020	5054020	or not.
5054020	5057580	It could be a bunch of crap, but certainly interesting that this would have already hit
5057580	5060100	the internet when the game is not supposed to be out for a month.
5060100	5061100	Uh oh.
5061100	5062100	That could be bad.
5062100	5064900	I don't think it's legit from what I've heard so far.
5064900	5066380	It could be a beta build or something.
5066380	5070460	And to be honest, 7.2 gigs, that doesn't take that long to download on Usenet.
5070460	5071460	Alright.
5071460	5074460	Not that I would know or anything.
5074460	5080380	Sorry, I got the giggles there for a second.
5080380	5084860	Um, some interesting stuff though that was coming out.
5084860	5092300	According to computers and video games, Tetsuya Mizuguchi has hinted that there is indeed
5092300	5094900	a sequel to Rez coming.
5094900	5100580	And his comment was, I'm just thinking about that, I don't know if this is a Rez sequel
5100580	5107860	or not, but that kind of synthesization concept, I'm feeling that we needed to make those kinds
5107860	5110960	of things, new things with new technology.
5110960	5115700	So possibly a new Rez game on next gen console?
5115700	5116700	Vibrator 2.0.
5116700	5117700	That would be pretty sweet.
5117700	5118700	I'm looking forward to it.
5118700	5122740	I need a tran- I mean, I would like a trans vib- hi!
5122740	5126180	Look, the ferret.
5126180	5130700	Interesting comment in chatroom from Footy Monster in regards to the Gears of War piracy
5130700	5131700	story.
5131700	5136100	It has happened before, Sky, Shenmue 2 on Dreamcast was four CDs and got leaked three
5136100	5138820	weeks before the release date.
5138820	5140340	Hmm.
5140340	5141420	Interesting.
5141420	5147020	Alright, well that's going to do it for the news here in this part A of Orange Lounge
5147020	5152380	Radio but we have some more exciting stuff to get to and that would be our DDR previews.
5152380	5155980	That's right, for the past few weeks we've been premiering new tracks from Dance Dance
5155980	5161620	Revolution Ultramix 4 as well as DDR Universe, going to be coming out for the Xbox and the
5161620	5164220	Xbox 360 a little later this year.
5164220	5168500	Tonight we've got four songs for you guys, two songs from DDR Ultramix 4 and two songs
5168500	5169500	from DDR Universe.
5169500	5174540	We're going to start tonight with a long version and this is a song that's going to be in DDR
5174540	5179140	Universe and it's by a group who was originally in DDR Ultramix 2.
5179140	5182580	It's one of the artists on the A Different Drum label and we're going to play the long
5182580	5184700	version of the song for you guys tonight.
5184700	5189740	The artist is nuropa who did the song Standing Still in Time in Ultramix 2 and they're going
5189740	5192700	to be in DDR Universe with this song.
5192700	5199700	It's the long version of beyond here and now, here on Orange Lounge Radio Power Previews.
5222700	5250700	The thoughts are drifting far away, a memory of yesterday.
5250700	5256700	Standing in our way, standing in our way.
5256700	5263700	If I surrendered to your arms, wasn't captured by your charms.
5263700	5271700	There'd be nothing left to say, nothing left to say.
5271700	5285700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5285700	5301700	Cause living in doubt is living without testimony, without refrain.
5315700	5334700	And if we could fly tonight, a light like falling rain.
5334700	5341700	Nothing more to contain, nothing more to contain.
5341700	5348700	Would you stay right by my side, a stolen heart of lovers' pride.
5348700	5355700	I'll lead you to this side, lead you to this side.
5355700	5369700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5369700	5383700	Cause living in doubt is living without testimony, without refrain.
5383700	5397700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5397700	5410700	Cause living in doubt is living without testimony, without refrain.
5427700	5440700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5440700	5452700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5452700	5472700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5472700	5479700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5479700	5489700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5489700	5499700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5499700	5509700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5509700	5519700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5519700	5529700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5529700	5539700	Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.
5539700	5559700	Enjoy.
