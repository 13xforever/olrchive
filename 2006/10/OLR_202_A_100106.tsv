13962	19370	Tonight, October 1st, 2006, Microsoft drops some surprises at X06.
19811	23256	Other uses for your Microsoft Points besides Microsoft Arcade.
23596	26080	And will next-gen Castlevania go back to its roots?
32406	37167	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37207	43608	We are that podcast dedicated to video gaming and gamer culture and the gamer news that you guys really want to know about.
43808	45749	At least the stuff we think you want to know about.
46309	47249	I'm here to help you through that.
47309	48309	My name is Rob Roberts.
48349	49349	You might know me as Sky.
49429	53790	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54090	55291	How are you doing?
56031	56831	I'm a little worn out.
57145	58326	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
84640	87221	Say hello to the sober for now, Loki!
87522	87842	Hello.
88702	89203	No, just kidding.
89223	90564	Tonight is not a drunk episode.
91144	92905	We're being very responsible adults tonight.
93065	94707	Right, Techmaster Loki?
95867	96067	Sure.
97188	98809	Maybe he is drunk and he just didn't say anything.
98849	100270	I don't know.
100751	103473	We like to always start it off talking about our gaming weeks.
103713	104874	So let's get right into it.
104934	106395	Let's cut the crap and talk games.
106695	108336	DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?
108536	109777	I played DDR on Tuesday.
110918	112559	Just, you know, extreme games.
113117	114298	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
136778	138319	One of them was the definite emo kid.
138379	139560	There was the punk girl.
139761	142543	There was the token normal friend.
142603	146006	You know, the kind of nerdy person.
146566	147487	Were they all playing DDR?
147507	148087	They were all playing DDR.
149472	155215	And so I was there with my friend Heather, who's on my LiveJournal.
155935	157476	And we had fun.
157856	161437	Speaking of emo, meeting people from LiveJournal, huh?
161477	165179	Well, I've been friends with her through LiveJournal for like, I guess, a year or so.
165579	167200	And she's friends with my cousins-in-law.
167940	170341	Like, she actually, you know, hangs out with them regularly.
170721	172502	So we just figured, let's finally just go hang out.
172642	173022	So we did.
173042	174043	Cool.
174123	178465	And then we... I went to...
180367	181608	Oh, crap, I lost my train of thought.
181668	182508	Okay.
182968	186130	My friend Tiara, you all know Tiara, my sauce.
187070	189591	She introduced me to a game called Pirate King Online.
190132	191352	It's a new MMO.
192052	193733	Right now it's in open beta.
194874	195934	And it's cute.
196374	201357	And you go around killing things and questing and getting clothes and making pie.
201917	202857	Oh, that's a different game.
202957	203438	I'm sorry.
203498	208600	I was familiar with the other Pirate King, which game I participate on a regular basis.
209150	212711	Is that like a website where you download pirated files or something?
212851	215351	No, I just, you know, I am the pirate king.
219112	230714	Anyway, and then I spent this entire weekend in the Bay Area with, everyone knows Kristen by now.
231794	232835	Yeah, she's been on a couple times.
233075	235195	Yeah, she was too tired to come on the show today.
236371	245016	We went to the Castro Street Fair and it was just so busy and so many people that it was just like, I'm tired.
245417	246177	I'm tired too.
246637	248158	Let's go get some hot chocolate, okay?
249099	251240	So I really didn't play anything else.
254682	255282	Interesting.
256963	258544	I played quite a bit this week.
259285	263267	There was a bunch of stuff I had lined up to play but I never got around to.
264353	266495	The whole hooking up the PlayStation 2 again thing.
268316	273719	I did get to play... Well, first off, my camera, I replaced the vision camera.
273959	275400	And yes, it was defective.
275821	277061	Got the new one, works great.
277302	279743	So now do you feel bad about bashing the camera last week?
280023	280664	No, I don't.
281044	283486	But it's good when it works.
283866	289049	I mean, so now that it's completely clear, I have a personalized picture up.
289449	293372	I played Uno, and I played Uno with the camera, and it's very...
294448	296189	I don't know, it can be boring and I guess weird.
297110	298771	Alright, how many people did you show your ass to?
298791	300453	I didn't show my ass to anybody.
300773	304436	But someone had their camera pointed towards the ceiling and they're all, oh yeah, I forgot to unplug it.
304656	306798	It had fallen behind the TV or something.
307718	313943	And then just another person that was just sitting there and then just someone else.
313963	315044	And you know what sucked?
315404	317426	We only had like three people, I think.
318287	321829	And the computer player just kicked all of our asses, so that kind of sucked.
322930	323831	I did win one game, though.
324775	325135	Good job.
325936	328036	And then, what else did I play?
328056	340782	I played Doom, and Doom was kind of fun, and then Rob dragged me into a multiplayer game, and the multiplayer game was so laggy as fucking hell, but I don't know.
340802	346784	I haven't played any other additional multiplayer games other than that, so I couldn't really say if that's like all the other games.
347225	352607	I seem to have this kind of bad track record with lagging multiplayer games, just from all the
353457	359120	My first Saints Row game was crap, multiplayer-wise was all laggy, and then Doom was all laggy.
359741	360621	So, I don't know.
360961	364944	It looks fun, so I'll probably try that a little bit later.
366044	373028	And then, of course, Nelly's been playing a lot of Zuma, and I've been playing quite a bit of Zuma.
374589	376470	And we're pretty far in that.
376511	377271	We actually have achievements.
377291	379993	We got the one for 24 hours, which is pretty interesting.
380033	380753	That's kind of sad.
381433	382434	She plays a lot, okay.
383928	386989	Seriously, she's been playing 360 more than I have, which is kind of interesting.
387609	389929	Saints Row-wise, I actually have been playing through Saints Row.
390450	390950	It's pretty fun.
392810	394790	I tried cheating this week.
395491	397171	Ooh, food.
398431	400572	But it didn't work like I wanted it to.
400732	402672	You get money accrued to you as time passes in-game.
407688	413411	and so I was just going to leave the game on and have my character walk around in circles with the analog stick.
414191	417973	But somehow it knew that I was doing that and so I didn't get that much money.
418073	420594	Either that or it just wasn't coming as fast as I thought it would.
421454	427937	Either way, I found out robbing a bunch of stores in a row is a lot better than just standing there waiting for time to pass.
430006	436827	I'm going to our always present fourth guest that we have here on Orange Launch Radio, the chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
436847	437548	Click on chat.
438008	442269	And I noticed that Jeremy Todd 1 says, OMG, Matt is turning Nellie into a gamer.
443169	446849	She loves her PopCap games, and God forbid they release Bejeweled 3.
447910	449510	I'll never see the 360 again.
449530	452171	That is a vicious lie!
453351	455551	I will never be a gamer, ever!
456371	458872	I will sell my baby before I do that.
462248	464971	Anyways, remind me to shut the door when we tape next time.
467232	470075	No, I did play one other thing.
470175	472517	I got the beta, which is funny because I got this in the mail.
473318	476781	I got the beta for Killzone Liberation, and I don't like it.
477822	478302	I'm sorry.
478682	488711	I don't like what they're doing with the PSP as far as taking these really good first-person shooters and then all of a sudden, look, now it's an isometric third-person shooter game.
490041	491262	and DarkSakura.
520435	520755	Is that it?
521316	523578	Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
524038	525779	Just stop mentioning it.
525819	527681	We know you play the damn thing.
527721	528622	All your work breaks.
528742	529683	Just get over it.
529723	532385	We keep complaining about it and we're like, we gotta switch to another game.
532765	536708	But I'm confident that we'll move on to Vice City Stories and hopefully Multiplayer.
536728	537269	I don't get you.
537289	540651	You're the only gamer I know that'll be like, God, I hate this game and I can't stop playing.
541072	541532	I'm addicted.
541552	542053	What can I say?
543534	543574	Um...
544463	545044	MyGamingWeek
556738	575517	Because of the fact that the game is basically free on the PC, I mean they released the source code some time ago And for the fact that really, you can play Doom on the Xbox 360 without downloading it from Marketplace Just get a copy of Doom 3 Collector's Edition Because the Doom 3 Collector's Edition had Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 as playable games in it
577084	584428	So really the only thing that this new Doom adds is the Xbox Live component, and they touched some things up.
584448	590492	They say the graphics are improved, but come on, it's still the pixelated wonder we all remember from the old PC days.
592515	594635	That being said, I do love Doom.
594875	596396	I do love me some Doom an awful lot.
596416	596876	Yes, Jamie?
597196	602497	It just has ultra-violence and hurt me plenty, and I love the titles of the difficulty levels.
602917	606158	Yes, I mean, it still has all that wonder that made it such a great game in the 90s.
606198	614579	And I'll tell you what, there really is something to be said, because I used to play this game on my slow-ass 486 computer, and I would have to shrink the window down to get a decent frame rate.
614839	618100	You know, I'm squinting on this little 15-inch monitor to play Doom.
618570	640503	and now I'm playing it on my like my new TV that's like 32 inch you know high def I know some of you guys have bigger TVs but just bear with me here you know that big huge screen and height of it's there's something to be said about that the game actually scared me today I turned around and one of those little imp things that looks like that creature from signs that ran by forget it but that thing scared the hell out of me
641297	642978	and I'm like, ah, I shouldn't get scared at this.
643018	645579	These things are pixelated and not supposed to freak me out, but it did.
645960	652303	And so I think there's still something to be said about the fact that Doom still has that, you know, charm and has lasted all these years.
653104	655745	Xbox Live is hit and miss.
656406	667172	Sometimes I get into a quick match game and I played some deathmatch and it works pretty well, but like I played a game with a listener in Loki and it was laggy as hell, so I don't know if one of us just had a bad connection or what was going on, but that kind of made me sad.
668672	669413	But, you know...
670242	670582	I don't know.
670662	679191	If Xbox Live Play is something that interests you, if having this game on your TV set is something that interests you, then it's a decent buy.
679371	681553	And you want to get achievement points or whatever, then cool.
682233	689180	But otherwise, you know, maybe you ought to just download the one that's on the computer if you just want to play Doom and you don't really care about where you do it.
689420	690161	Do the cheats work?
691442	691862	I don't know.
691903	692984	I haven't plugged in my keyboard.
693124	693384	Did you?
693724	695086	No, I read it somewhere, though.
695306	695546	Lame.
696284	705026	I'd have to try it out for myself, though, because, what was it, IDDQD was God Mode, and IDNRA, no, that was, NRA was Hexen.
705726	708886	So somebody tried plugging in the keyboard and doing it, because we thought about it, we just didn't try it.
708926	709586	Oh, that sucks.
710527	711827	Can you use a keyboard as a controller?
712947	713287	I don't know.
713747	714507	That I have to try.
714647	715727	I wonder if the chat room knows the answer.
715747	717668	I'm sorry, I can't play Doom with a controller.
718508	720708	No, it actually really works for me.
720928	724149	Like, I can move around in ways I couldn't before with a keyboard.
725066	731388	The keyboard, if you know your sidestep toggles and everything, it shouldn't be a problem.
731789	735230	Well, you know, there will be people that are keyboard for life.
735510	743373	A lot of PC gamers, if they're mostly the type that games on PC exclusively, they're going to probably be keyboard for life.
743473	745053	But they've gotten used to that.
745213	747154	I still haven't really, I don't know.
747174	750275	I could do it in World of Warcraft, but I can't really do it in Doom as well.
750515	751876	The other kid was IDBFG, I think.
752943	753224	Sorry.
753404	756766	Yeah, that's... I forgot how much I hate the BFG in multiplayer.
756806	758507	I really, really hate the BFG in multiplayer.
758748	768775	Well, thank you to Jada2006's IDDQD, IDKLAV, and IDBFG will give you the BFG.
769436	769696	Nice.
770737	772338	Now our whole chat room is going off.
772358	773278	My game was Hexen.
773499	777362	Yeah, now that I would like to see come out on the marketplace.
777382	779083	Because if you type in Satan, you get God Mode.
779203	780244	Rise of the Triad.
781004	781905	DMN will agree with you.
782720	786202	And also, I was really hoping they'd release Duke Nukem 3D.
787123	787543	I wish.
787723	788784	I really hope that happens.
788824	792426	I want someone to do a Quake hack and turn it into Silent Hill.
794047	800470	You know, that's too bad that we can't load those custom-made Doom WAD files onto Xbox Live Marketplace.
800670	804192	Wouldn't that be cool if they released some of the best ones as add-ons in the marketplace?
804212	805233	I had Gatchaman Doom.
806434	808355	And I would play the hell out of that.
808575	809195	Uber nerd.
809395	810556	I love Gatchaman.
811789	815311	My favorite one was killing Barney, where Barney was the final boss.
815431	816011	I remember that one.
816031	816851	Was that a Wolfenstein hack?
817332	818152	No, they had both.
818492	819933	There's also a Quake one, too.
820273	821773	All right, anyway, moving on from Doom.
822554	823914	I can talk about DDR Supernova now.
823954	826175	DDR Supernova is great.
826315	834638	I mean, if you're into DDR, I don't think there's anything new here that's going to win somebody who hasn't really played DDR before into this game.
834718	838500	Although, you know, just like every other DDR before it, it has beginner modes and things you can learn on.
839181	842722	Konami took some risks with the song list, but I think they paid off.
843203	844423	I rather enjoyed the song list.
844463	849865	And when I say they took risks, I mean they didn't do a carbon copy of the arcade machine, which I think a lot of people were expecting.
850185	852926	But I found some of the new steps and the new songs to be quite pleasant.
853606	859388	I did find it really interesting that they had some of the songs that were just now put into the arcade mix.
859428	863430	It was like Fascination, the Eternal Love thing, which, to be honest...
863922	868807	That's about as interesting to me as Paranoia Survivor and Paranoia Survivor Max.
868847	869327	You know what?
869487	872590	A lot of love out there, though, for Fascination and Eternal Love Mix.
872670	876995	A lot of love out there on the forums for it, so you have your opinion, they have theirs.
878756	888626	As far as the rest of the game, it's obvious that Konami has listened to a lot of the bitches that people had about EX2, especially when it came to Dance Master Mode, because this new
889031	889813	Stellar Magic Mode.
889834	890355	It's kind of neat.
890415	891458	It's a little bit different.
892742	897275	I wouldn't say it's necessarily easier, but it does seem like you can get your unlocks a little bit better.
897762	898422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
919850	920930	But it's definitely one of my favorites.
921030	923791	And certainly much better than Max 1 and Extreme War.
924111	927152	It's certainly on the upper end of PlayStation 2 DDR mixes.
927193	929233	So I do recommend it for DDR fans.
929753	933615	And if you hate DDR, well, then you're probably going to hate Supernova.
933655	935275	So there's nothing new for you here.
935355	936676	Move along.
937596	939657	Other than that, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.
939697	942338	I was playing 99 Nights for a little bit.
942678	946219	I was watching my friend play Enchanted Arms because I haven't been playing it a lot.
946239	949280	But I've been watching my friend play through that while I play World of Warcraft on a Mac.
950035	955557	and, um, I went back to Beatmania 2DX because Loki gave me that second controller.
955817	957457	So I was like, ooh, I can play doubles now.
957917	962319	Um, I really suck at doubles because I've lost a lot of my 2DX skill in general.
962379	964459	Like, I'm just barely passing some 7s.
964519	967780	I used to be able to, you know, I used to be able to get some of the flashing 7s out and things.
968401	970061	Um, but I'm working my way up on doubles.
970121	970701	Doubles is fun.
970741	973102	It's kind of renewing my interest in 2DX all over again.
973182	974442	So I'll have to get some of the newer styles.
974702	976083	The newest one I have is Night Style.
976123	976663	Isn't that sad?
976954	981999	There's been like 10th, 11th, and Happy Sky, or 10th, Red, and Happy Sky on the way.
982840	996132	I've played the Pirate King game, and I've gotten Red, and I'm actually looking at more of the Guitar Freaks games like V, and the Silver Collection, or whatever it is, I can't remember what it is.
996152	996953	Some import one.
998416	1001099	But next week, though, I was hoping to have a review for it this week.
1001179	1012773	Earth Defense Force 2 is the game I'm going to be playing, which, for those who may have seen some of the stuff coming from Tokyo Game Show, Earth Defense Force 3 was the first Simple 2000 game that's going to be on the Xbox 360.
1012813	1016217	So I've got to play the one before it, because that one's not out yet.
1017076	1018097	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1034088	1034428	Project Silphid
1060902	1062163	It's pretty.
1062183	1065726	I also got to see the demo for White Knight for PS3.
1065766	1067968	That actually could convince me to buy one.
1068368	1068649	Really?
1070130	1071731	$49.99 is what Fusion Frenzy is.
1071751	1072652	See, that's a little high for me.
1072812	1073112	I don't know.
1073133	1075955	I don't know if I do enough party game things at the house to justify that.
1076175	1078517	It's kind of one of those things, maybe after Christmas it'll drop to $29.39.
1078617	1084302	It's really bad timing, too, because it's coming out a couple weeks before the Wii.
1084482	1085583	Yeah, I don't know.
1085723	1086604	I don't know about Fusion Frenzy.
1087243	1093711	I'll tell you this, I definitely know about this one though, and I'm sorry because it's probably going to make some people cry, but the Sonic the Hedgehog demo came out on 360.
1094032	1096915	It's awful.
1097376	1098377	I told you all!
1098397	1099138	It is absolutely awful.
1099795	1100776	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1126437	1129900	Why Sonic the Hedgehog has just gone so awful with this new one.
1130200	1143751	And somebody pointed out to me, I want to say it was in an email or something, I think it was Rob sent me this, you know, our friend on the East Coast, Rob, I want to say sent me this in an email, something about, you know, the Test Drive Unlimited demo wasn't that hot either, and the final game was pretty decent.
1144071	1144692	But I don't know.
1144992	1147294	I don't know if there's much that can save this Sonic.
1147574	1149356	I mean, the controls are awful.
1149856	1152198	Trying to manipulate Sonic was just bad.
1152658	1154139	Where did Sonic go wrong?
1154240	1155841	Because Sonic hasn't been...
1156241	1160742	This bad in 3D before, because I remember the last one they had on GameCube wasn't that bad.
1161102	1166944	It was even okay on... Do you remember the Sonic collection that came out on the Saturn?
1167184	1169884	It had the 3D running around the world bit in it.
1170424	1174885	That was better control than... I just... It's awful.
1175806	1179367	You have to download this just to see how far downhill the series has gone.
1179427	1180147	It's kind of sad.
1180627	1185548	It almost feels like they tried to retool the engine or something, but... They're just trying to figure out, you know, how they...
1186258	1189100	Sonic is just, you know, it's been the same game all the time.
1189120	1194824	They're trying to really, trying to re-jump, you know, juvenize the whole franchise.
1194844	1199107	Because, I mean, you had Shadow the Hedgehog, which they were trying to go a different way with it, and it sucked.
1199848	1200949	It sold horribly.
1201289	1205752	And then you have Sonic Riders, which, you know, it's a pretty fun racing game.
1206132	1207694	But, um, and that one actually did pretty well.
1208354	1212397	Now, Sonic the Hedgehog, the problem is, I think now you've got an...
1213727	1219889	I don't even know what the... It's like not even close to what the original Sonic the Hedgehog games were.
1219909	1221729	I mean, as far as the storyline and everything.
1222869	1226670	Now you're trying to like throw in elements almost like a Final Fantasy or something like that.
1226970	1227310	I don't know.
1227490	1231191	And then, you know, all these new characters with each game and stuff.
1231551	1232471	It's just kind of crazy.
1232852	1238313	Plus, now that the systems are even faster and they can crunch the graphics even faster, so Sonic is even faster.
1238913	1240953	But the problem is he doesn't control any better.
1241194	1242814	So you have the same kind of control...
1243579	1247201	and Respawn's time as you did on the Sonic games that were slower.
1247341	1251424	Now that this thing is like lightning fast, it's really hard to control.
1252645	1257568	I'm going to the chat room and reading some of the comments here on Sonic demo.
1258048	1259989	FootyMonster says, want to save Sonic?
1260029	1261110	Go back to Sonic Adventure 2.
1262042	1265585	Funnydale says, well, you know, the last few Sonic games sucked ass as well.
1265965	1267646	You know, not this bad, though.
1267846	1273390	I mean, nothing to me has matched the greatness of the old Genesis ones, Sonic 1, 2, and 3.
1273791	1275132	And Sonic Spinball, of course.
1275552	1276973	Nothing has really matched that for me.
1277053	1281877	But, like, even the last few ones, whereas they weren't that good, they weren't this bad.
1282957	1287201	Sonic Adventure was probably about the... I'd have to say the pinnacle of the whole 3D...
1288246	1289207	Sonic the Hedgehog
1311822	1314503	E3 demo came out, and it hasn't really improved since then.
1314563	1317364	So that kind of... Either a couple things happened.
1317524	1320844	One, they just didn't have time to make a new demo, so they just put out the E3 demo.
1321004	1323465	Or two, the game hasn't really improved since then.
1324825	1329587	All right, well, if you're a fan of the new Sonic game, maybe there's something about it we're missing.
1329627	1330527	We'd love to hear from you.
1330727	1332507	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1332908	1334908	We're always willing to hear some difference of opinions.
1335388	1336969	We might say you're wrong, wrong, wrong.
1337409	1338589	But no, we'll definitely...
1339232	1340152	Read your emails on them.
1340172	1342373	Now, Jamie, did you see SmackDown vs. Raw 7?
1344394	1348176	I actually found a story on that that we're going to be discussing.
1348796	1353438	Well, I guess we'll get into the news since we're starting to touch on some of the things we wanted to talk about tonight.
1353958	1359560	And the first thing in tonight's gaming news is, of course, as we talked about in our gaming weeks, Doom came out on Xbox Live.
1359920	1364322	What was somewhat interesting about the way Doom came out on Xbox Live is that it was very stealth.
1365111	1374368	Microsoft had said that there was a secret project they were working on and a really big series was coming to Xbox Live and some other folks had speculated that the series was Lode Runner.
1374938	1376458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1403496	1406561	Yeah, certain websites we don't like to talk about broke the embargo.
1416598	1416959	Good for them.
1417379	1424105	So anyway, of course, Doom Live supports multiplayer on one screen or on multiple screens via Xbox Live.
1424746	1428609	It is Doom 1, not Doom 2, and some people would say Doom 2 is the superior game.
1428890	1429390	But who knows?
1429550	1433274	If this is out now and does well, I'd say Doom 2 is just a matter of time.
1433554	1438778	But as a reminder, if you have the Doom 3 Collector's Edition, you already can play Doom on the Xbox 360.
1438859	1441321	But, you know, of course, with this you get achievements.
1441681	1444322	Slightly improved graphics and the Xbox Live Play.
1444342	1451504	Next we'll see Quake 2 because that was on Quake 4 except it had achievements but you didn't get any points for it.
1451804	1455125	How about Quake 1 with the original Trent Reznor music?
1455225	1456065	That would be kind of fun.
1457066	1457966	That would be really fun.
1458046	1465848	I was also surprised that Doom 1 was only 22 megabytes to download but then again I guess that's probably how big it was back then.
1466249	1470830	Back then my hard drive was only like 100 megabytes so it was a huge game at the time.
1471212	1472232	I remember spanning floppies with that thing.
1472252	1476333	Well, as far as things that we need to see about, our dear, dear director friend Peter Jackson has decided that he's got his interest in
1493408	1498671	Stuck in the Xbox 360 as a new medium for storytelling.
1499031	1511698	He said that his team at Wingnut Studios is working with Microsoft to co-design and co-produce an original chapter in the Halo stories with Bungie.
1513099	1519382	They haven't named it or anything yet, but the quote says here, to captivate a new audience that have yet to discover the power of interactive entertainment.
1519991	1520752	I think that's pretty neat.
1520772	1526117	You know, it's good that big names are starting to recognize, you know, exactly just the basically limitless freedom that a video game will give them in terms of creativity.
1542771	1543952	I think it's kind of interesting.
1543992	1547435	You know, I can't claim to be the world's hugest fan of Lord of the Rings.
1547455	1549316	I mean, don't get me wrong, I thought the movies were good.
1549737	1554361	But I think this is really neat, and it sort of, to me, legitimizes gaming in a way.
1554381	1559625	I mean, here you have this Oscar-winning director coming over and saying, hey, I'm going to make a game.
1560245	1567311	And it's a little different than previous, you know, attempts to kind of bring Hollywood into games a little more.
1567351	1569433	Like, does anyone remember Apocalyptico, or what is it?
1569453	1570154	Was that the name of the game?
1570334	1570674	Apocalypse?
1571669	1572450	That's a band.
1572530	1574651	Apocalyptic is a string quartet.
1574731	1576152	Sorry, I'm thinking of the Mel Gibson movie.
1576712	1578913	No, there was a game on PS1 with Bruce Willis.
1579093	1580274	Was it Apocalypse?
1580554	1581655	I think it was Apocalypse.
1582035	1582935	Something like that, okay?
1583436	1584936	And that game was not so hot.
1585016	1586817	Well, the movie was not so hot.
1587138	1588098	Well, it wasn't based on a movie.
1588138	1588838	Wasn't it?
1589139	1589679	I don't think so.
1590379	1592761	Wasn't Bruce Willis in a movie called Apocalypse?
1592781	1593041	I don't know.
1593061	1594642	It was where they had to go drill a hole in the meteor?
1595242	1595922	No, you're thinking of...
1597972	1598472	Armageddon.
1598492	1598933	Armageddon.
1598993	1599794	Same difference.
1599874	1600434	Oh, my God.
1600694	1601455	No, this is different.
1601475	1603537	This is this was like a I don't know.
1603557	1604818	But anyway, just to expand.
1604978	1605678	Well, sorry.
1605698	1605898	Go ahead.
1605918	1606539	There was a little bit more.
1606559	1606679	Yeah.
1607240	1607960	Just to expand.
1608280	1618409	We Net Studios that I referred to earlier is Peter Jackson's new entertainment studio that is has his movie team and Microsoft's gaming division working together.
1618429	1620070	I thought that's pretty cool, too.
1621434	1625517	I have this theory that he probably saw it in progress, was really inspired and said, hey, I want to be a part of something else.
1650973	1652254	That's a distinct possibility.
1653314	1658356	I mean, that's how half of anybody really gets into anything, is they have to be introduced to it first, right?
1659917	1663918	Well, some other cool stuff came out about the Halo franchise during Exos 6.
1664578	1673002	Unfortunately, nothing about Halo 3, because they said, later on this year you'll hear something, which would probably be timed with the PlayStation 3 launch or something like that.
1673342	1678464	But anyways, one very interesting thing, which kind of ties in with the whole story we had last week about the...
1680151	1681232	Cease and desist Cease and desist
1696997	1701360	It came out that they're actually making a Halo RTS type of game called Halo Wars.
1701861	1704923	It's being put together by Ensemble Studios and Bungie.
1705003	1709107	Ensemble, you might remember, did the Age of Empires series.
1709647	1718054	So, should be pretty cool looking and kind of by the looks of the trailer that also hit the Xbox Live Marketplace, it looks very StarCraft-ish.
1718574	1721516	So, should fill that void a little bit at least.
1721837	1723338	That'll be a fun one to play on live, I bet.
1723758	1723838	Yeah.
1723858	1724719	It'll be hugely popular.
1724919	1725359	I think so.
1725419	1726020	I think they're trying to
1726480	1729763	I almost grabbed the same audience of StarCraft with this.
1730604	1731845	Now I have a question for you guys.
1732625	1739731	Do you think that this could be, you know, with this Peter Jackson project and Halo Wars and Halo 3 on the horizon, is this too much Halo?
1739931	1742533	Are we headed for an oversaturation of Halo in the market?
1742674	1743614	No, I don't think so.
1743654	1753282	Because the time frame that these games are coming out with, this, you know, one that Peter Jackson is probably working on, probably won't even see it next year, if you know anything.
1753623	1755324	So you have like Halo 3 coming out,
1755817	1756558	Halo 3, Halo 3, Halo 3
1781039	1783401	and a lot of people are still very skeptical about that release.
1783761	1787345	But could this be now that we know that there's another Halo project being worked on?
1787385	1789787	Because everybody was saying, oh, Halo 3's got to be Christmas.
1789827	1790808	Halo 3's got to be Christmas.
1791188	1797974	Is it possible that now Halo Wars is their Christmas title and Halo 3 is indeed going to make the March or April release?
1798054	1798594	It's possible.
1799615	1800176	Speculation.
1800316	1800616	I don't know.
1800756	1804800	Well, did you see the story this week about, what was it?
1805600	1812041	Amazon.com had Halo 3 pre-orders and the release date was March 31st, which I thought was interesting.
1812421	1812721	Huh.
1813181	1814281	But, you know, who knows.
1814622	1815342	We'll see what happens.
1815902	1822563	Now, again, and I hate reading from the same person consistently, but everybody else is doing flooding in our channel right now.
1823043	1825803	Jeremy Tom 1 says, Bungie is turning into EA.
1825863	1829904	They are starting to put new Halo games out every year and seriously milking the franchise.
1829924	1830204	Wrong.
1830224	1832705	This isn't like Halo 06 or Halo 07.
1832765	1834865	They're actually mixing things up instead of just...
1835305	1836085	Updating rosters
1860472	1860972	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1875540	1881984	Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the few tactical games that held my attention I'm just not really into tactical games usually Why hasn't there been a new Final Fantasy Tactics?
1882004	1883986	Because Square Enix has bastard people working for them
1905924	1907127	Just kidding, just kidding.
1908209	1912781	Alright, anyway, another news that came out of X06, it's of note.
1913553	1914293	No pun intended.
1914333	1917214	Guitar Hero 2 has finally been confirmed for the Xbox 360.
1918315	1924757	We've been speculating this for weeks and weeks, so this really shouldn't be big news, but it was confirmed officially.
1925057	1926857	There's a new controller coming out as well.
1927158	1933520	Despite news reports that were based off some pictures that were taken at XO6, the controller is not wireless.
1934280	1937841	There's no word yet if the controller will be wireless or not, if there will be a wireless version.
1938161	1939882	I kind of hope there's not, or if
1941303	1946045	If there is, I hope they offer a wired version still, because wireless means more money.
1946225	1948425	And the last thing I want to have to spend on Guitar Hero is more money.
1948485	1959729	It's not, and that's because it's a requirement that they have for their third-party peripheral makers that it has to be wired, which is weird, because I thought that they had wireless controllers made by, like, Madcatz and stuff.
1960109	1965431	But I guess when it comes down to these weird, you know, like, guitar controllers or dance pads, it's got to be wired.
1965971	1966171	So...
1966954	1967614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1983246	1984347	on PS2 when it comes out.
1984387	1985728	I'm going to wait for the 360 one.
1985808	1986809	That's kind of sad.
1986829	2001579	Because if it's going to have the microtransactions and the next-gen graphics, and I've pretty much been starting to play Xbox 360 more and more, and I know I'll be playing Wii more and more when that comes out, and eventually, when I finally decide to buy one, PlayStation 3, you know, I'll kind of be phasing out the old-gen games.
2001940	2007063	I don't know if I really want to pick up Guitar Hero 2 on PS2.
2007223	2007524	I don't know.
2007624	2009405	Do you guys feel similar, or...?
2010174	2012475	I would have personally announced this at the end of the year.
2013475	2015056	And then make us feel really screwed.
2015076	2015736	That would have been great.
2015756	2017436	It's a way to make more money.
2017756	2018597	I guess that's true.
2019117	2019837	Jamie, what do you think?
2019877	2020737	I know you're a Guitar Hero fan.
2020757	2022078	Are you going to purchase the one on PlayStation 2?
2022118	2023538	Are you going to hold out for this one, or what?
2024318	2025359	Why don't I just get them both?
2027379	2027880	I forgot.
2027920	2028960	You're a whore for everything.
2029900	2030180	Gaming.
2030841	2031161	Gaming.
2033315	2034677	I don't see where the debate is.
2035017	2036218	I have both systems.
2036258	2040302	I should have both games, especially if they do something different for one than the other.
2042144	2046689	Honestly, my preference would be to have it on Xbox 360 if they're not doing anything different for it.
2047182	2060568	because I would rather not have, like, jaggedy edges and I'd rather have better, you know, music, better sound capability and, you know, more processing power and the ability to potentially download more songs.
2060588	2061028	Yeah, exactly.
2061088	2063830	For me, it's like Karaoke Revolution on Xbox versus PlayStation 2.
2064190	2072874	As much as, you know, I love the PlayStation 2 and it's great, but when you put the two platforms side by side in a game like Karaoke Revolution, I could download more songs on the Xbox version and it just...
2073194	2074375	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2092028	2093250	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2105727	2108469	Oh, did he say that the Guitar Hero doesn't have that great graphics?
2108489	2110350	It doesn't have that much in the way of graphics in the first place.
2110370	2111891	Yeah, it does.
2111951	2116573	DDR is just like a bunch of movies playing in the background with like a character dancing.
2116593	2117454	Right.
2117554	2120235	No, this actually has a whole lot that went into it.
2120476	2128720	Which is actually part of the reason it did so well is because it really kind of had that silly quality to it that kind of puts you there.
2128800	2129320	You know what I mean?
2129361	2133643	Like you having all that stuff and the crowd and everything kind of
2134417	2137059	Did something for the game in a way the Guitar Freaks didn't.
2137139	2137559	You know what I mean?
2137759	2139100	This is what I actually liked about it.
2139180	2142442	It sort of incorporated the things I liked about Karaoke Revolution.
2142482	2144903	You have the stage and the whole contest thing.
2145003	2147545	It sort of puts a little bit more into the game.
2147645	2150947	I thought it was like, yeah, let's go ahead and rock out here.
2151347	2153048	I thought that that was pretty cool.
2153068	2154589	It added a great deal of fun to the game.
2156430	2162213	Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, his own show is over at allgames.com on Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific.
2162593	2163574	He says, it hit me.
2164352	2164872	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2178075	2185478	Well, now you guys know how we feel, you know, being DDR fans about all these DDR pads for the different platforms, too.
2185518	2186739	It's like, God, I have five DDR pads.
2186759	2188219	Why don't you just get the multi-pad?
2188680	2196543	But even then, the Red Octane one, the last one they did, it doesn't support 360, so there's going to be another pad that comes out I'm going to have to get for frickin' universe.
2198064	2198304	Oh, well.
2199745	2203846	And you know they're not going to just go, let's support the USB pad from Red Octane.
2203866	2205107	You know, let's do that.
2205147	2206628	Let's do that favor.
2206888	2207568	No, that's not going to happen.
2208147	2210728	I do like the 360 guitar that looks like a Thunderbird.
2211388	2214570	But anyway, we have a little bit more.
2216931	2222433	Now, I don't know if all our listeners know this, but I am a closet wrestling fan.
2224234	2233638	So there is a demo for SmackDown vs. Raw available on Xbox Live Marketplace for the 2007 version.
2235667	2245752	Also joining that is Tony Hawk's Project 8, Wheelman, Frontlines, Fuel of War and Crossfire, and the montage thing, which I actually haven't watched yet.
2246252	2256958	Also for our listeners who are in France, Italy, Germany, or Spain, if you missed the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion download content, it is back up for 150 Microsoft points apiece.
2257458	2258599	But I want my wrestling.
2259259	2262701	Yeah, they had some pretty good videos up on live marketplaces.
2264236	2269858	Some interesting stuff also coming from Exo-6, of course, a lot to even mention.
2269898	2277822	But, of course, they announced that Splinter Cell 5, the one after Double Agent, is going to be exclusive to the 360, which I thought was pretty interesting.
2278422	2287065	Bioshock, the very amazing looking game, is going to be a 360 exclusive, which is coming out in April, by the way.
2287705	2291507	And also on the Windows platform.
2292486	2298251	The game looks amazing, so if you haven't checked out the video yet, please do yourself a favor and check it out now.
2299252	2305437	Some surprises, I should say, Banjo-Kazooie, they announced a new game in that franchise for the 360.
2306838	2312042	Some not so big surprises, Project Gotham Racing 4 was being worked on.
2312762	2315284	and they had a very generic looking trailer for that.
2315304	2316385	The trailer was a joke.
2316525	2320628	I mean, it was nothing but... It was kind of like the Simpsons teaser trailer.
2320648	2321628	Well, at least that was funny.
2321648	2322449	I mean, it had a gag in it.
2322469	2323890	But, you know, there really wasn't anything to it.
2323970	2324450	You know what I mean?
2324470	2326232	This is kind of like, the game's coming.
2326632	2326932	Soon.
2327352	2330595	I mean, but the Halo 3 teaser trailer was like, ooooh.
2331395	2360799	you know, I am the future you know, that whole thing that's how you do a teaser trailer there will be an MMO coming to the Xbox 360 with Marvel Universe Online which is supposed to be kind of a sequel to what was it oh, I'm drawing a mental blank now I was going to say, you know, Phantasy Star Universe is coming soon, that's an MMO well, no, City of Heroes it seems to be working together on that and they'll also be hitting Windows Vista as well
2362180	2367081	and it's even being worked on by Cryptic Studios, the, of course, creators of City of Heroes.
2367661	2374663	And then finally, the last bit of info they talked about was the HD DVD player for the Xbox 360.
2374723	2383485	It's going to be priced at $199 in North America with pretty much equivalent pricing in the rest of the world.
2384465	2387226	And they will be including a free copy...
2388573	2396821	Not too surprising after the whole announcement of Peter Jackson working on Halo of King Kong as well as Universal Remote.
2398122	2412195	That's a good movie to test your player on because it's a nice, good, long, very long, very overly long sample movie to include to test on the HD DVD player.
2412751	2415174	So, yeah, lots of good stuff coming out.
2415254	2415795	I like the movie.
2415815	2430592	It was just... There was some other announcements, I think, that have already been made before about how Rockstar is going to be making exclusive content for the Xbox 360 version of Gran Turismo 4, which is not a huge... I mean, it's big, but we already know that.
2431052	2431233	And...
2432028	2438391	Yeah, just lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of games and trailers, and they showed off Half-Life 2, and that looked pretty and stuff.
2438731	2443834	Now, out of curiosity, did Rockstar say that they weren't doing something similar on PlayStation 3?
2444174	2459182	I mean, I know they said these episodes or whatever were exclusive for 360, but if PlayStation 3 supports microtransactions, which after last week's Gran Turismo thing we know it's going to, what's to say that they won't cook up different scenarios for the PlayStation 3, and it'll be...
2459882	2462124	Or additional two, these two.
2462405	2465868	Or some different scenarios that are going to be on PlayStation 3.
2466128	2472894	So it's that whole Soul Calibur 2, play with Link on the GameCube, play with Spawn on the Xbox all over again.
2473074	2474475	Something a little different.
2474495	2479019	We don't know a whole lot about the PlayStation 3 marketplace or whatever.
2479520	2483823	So they might be running other obstacles with this type of stuff.
2483843	2486766	Because if you notice, a lot of companies, I know Sega for
2487335	2510841	Virtual Attendance 3 actually took out online play on it for the PlayStation 3 version because apparently they're running into some difficulties so yeah I'm I wouldn't be surprised if you see something especially if the marketplace is taken off you know after the PlayStation 3 launches I mean Grand or Grand Theft Auto 4 is just gonna be the next big thing I mean it's just huge so
2512148	2514271	Saints Row will whet the appetite for now, but I can't wait
2524764	2528765	Well, now, the only news to come out this week wasn't just about the Xbox.
2528805	2532626	I mean, granted, we have a lot of Xbox news because they had, you know, their big X06.
2532947	2534707	But there are some news on the other consoles.
2534807	2536388	One thing I want to say about the PlayStation 3.
2537608	2542750	According to Bloomberg, Sony is going to be launching a massive PlayStation 3 marketing campaign.
2543170	2548711	Now, they're going to have demo kiosks in five times as many stores as the PlayStation 2.
2549552	2552152	Yeah, the PlayStation 2 had about 3,000 demo stations.
2552433	2553253	The PlayStation 3...
2554520	2559924	is supposedly going to have like 10,000 up to maybe 15,000 demo stations.
2560424	2568850	So that's like five times as many if it's 15,000, which is kind of weird when you consider that there's supposed to be that big console shortage they're going to have at launch.
2568890	2573053	So it's like, you know, you could be putting some of that into producing extra consoles, but whatever.
2573433	2577116	I mean, they're not saying that all five times of this is going to hit at once.
2578016	2578557	So who knows?
2579133	2582434	Maybe they're running all off of the rack mount servers.
2583014	2585275	Maybe that's what they're going to use them for afterwards.
2585295	2585575	Who knows?
2585595	2586835	That actually might not be a bad idea.
2587335	2587715	Who knows?
2588035	2590876	That just was so pitiful.
2591276	2592196	I know, I know, I know.
2592216	2593977	You've got to do what you've got to do.
2594137	2598478	Three steps in the right direction, because they're going to need to market the hell out of this thing.
2598922	2602605	To convince people, here's why you need to spend $600 on this.
2602885	2604246	Well, you said it right there.
2604306	2616395	And I mean, even the most fanboy of Sony has to admit, you know, Sony needs to show us and the casual gamer why you want to spend $600 on this system.
2616435	2617455	So they do need to put it out.
2617475	2621538	It should be demoing Blu-ray movies and some hot trailers of PS3 exclusives.
2622019	2625221	Put some Metal Gear Solid demos on there, you know, something like that.
2625261	2627963	Really sell the hell out of your system and that might help you.
2628302	2635648	Well, actually, this is sort of related to something that was just given to me not a few moments ago from our chat room.
2636749	2638050	Sure.
2638190	2647218	PSM got an actual... Their PlayStation magazine got an actual fully functional PS3 console delivered to them.
2647418	2647678	Hmm.
2648919	2649980	That's not too surprising.
2650981	2653223	Well, yeah, it is PSM, so that makes sense.
2653723	2656586	But I think it's pretty funny that they, you know...
2657452	2662217	They're actually starting to get these out now to, you know, I guess they're VIPs.
2662417	2670544	They should have sent it without games because, you know, they said, you know, the PS3, you'll buy it even if it doesn't have games because it's PlayStation.
2670725	2674108	There's a reflection of Motorstorm showing on the console in this picture.
2675289	2676270	It's pretty fun.
2677211	2681195	But anyway, as far as...
2683166	2684827	Other systems coming out.
2685347	2685947	Walmart.
2686367	2691269	Yes, everybody's favorite low-price store of crappy goods.
2694231	2695571	Hey, but don't laugh.
2695631	2697232	I get decent stuff there once in a while.
2697272	2698672	It's not my favorite place to shop.
2698812	2699733	I got the best shirt there.
2699753	2702094	It says, I love pirates and has a pirate ship on the butt.
2702354	2702774	But anyway.
2703594	2712198	Walmart is considering not using the Wii demo station at their stores because of the risk of a child or consumer...
2713012	2714133	Thank you for watching!
2734548	2736670	Maybe it's not so far off.
2736750	2737971	Maybe it is something to consider.
2738291	2743955	But I'm thinking, they've had the eye toy for PS2 demoed there, and that's one of those games that encourages you to flap your arms about.
2744976	2752241	Flapping, hitting somebody with your hand, you know, just by accident, is a lot different than smacking somebody in the head with a piece of hard plastic.
2752361	2757385	Yeah, but won't they have the hard plastic on some type of chain, or it's only going to have a limited range anyway?
2758786	2761148	I don't give the, you know...
2761806	2764447	Corporate powers that be at Walmart that much.
2764868	2765288	Mental.
2765328	2766868	You end up getting broken or stolen.
2768629	2770350	I honestly, I'm not surprised.
2771611	2775973	But that just means that people will go to places other than Walmart to buy their Wii, won't it?
2776433	2776813	Not really.
2776833	2778694	Well, you may not have an option in some parts of the nation.
2778714	2782496	No, people will just go to other parts, you know, other stores to demo the Wii.
2782536	2785998	They can buy it at Walmart because they're the low price leader, of course.
2786298	2787819	They're also the low quality leader, too.
2787839	2788279	Yeah.
2789212	2789973	Hi Walmart!
2790053	2799979	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily... The one good thing about Walmart is that when I lived in Alabama, Super Walmart was open 24 hours and I had somewhere to go and I was bored.
2799999	2801460	Wow.
2801480	2802160	At the Denny's.
2803101	2803962	Walmart.
2803982	2806223	You know what, when I was in college in Chico, it was the same thing.
2806683	2809545	We'd go to Walmart because we were bored and they were open 24 hours.
2809785	2816470	We'd basically, this is before I even heard of Eddie Izzard, we would do the Eddie Izzard theory of shopping where you just grab stuff, move it around, and then leave.
2817110	2818131	Because that's illegal!
2820365	2825529	Anyways, some other stores that I used to like to go to at least as a kid, Toys R Us.
2826149	2827290	What happened to Toys R Us?
2827690	2828611	So sad.
2829251	2829931	Really?
2830092	2831873	I actually sometimes do my gaming shopping there.
2832033	2833914	They have Jeffrey Chained in the basement.
2833934	2844621	Now that they've combined Kids R Us and Toys R Us and Babies R Us, it's less Toys R Us and more toddler crap.
2844641	2847163	They still have a pretty decent video gaming section, I've got to say.
2847623	2850145	And if you've ever been to Toys R Us in Times Square, it's hot.
2851298	2852839	Some of those big, big Toys R Uses are hot.
2852899	2854660	Okay, well, I haven't been there, but anyways.
2855320	2860082	One of the things that they had, of course, is their holiday list of must-have items.
2861643	2864804	And, of course, on the list was the Nintendo Wii.
2864944	2865884	What wasn't on the list?
2865944	2866625	The PlayStation 3.
2867125	2869366	The reason behind this is a couple things.
2869586	2880110	One, the PlayStation 3 is really geared towards savvy gaming enthusiasts, whereas the Nintendo Wii is basically going to appeal to young kids as well as adults.
2880977	2890961	The other thing is, one of their criteria for making this list is knowing that they're going to have a sufficient stock for the item during the holiday season.
2891981	2894983	Which we know that the PlayStation 3, that will not be the case.
2895483	2897544	So, very interesting.
2897824	2903126	I do see this, I think the Wii would kind of mesh very well with Toys R Us.
2903166	2905827	It seems to be the same kind of clientele, so.
2907250	2912872	All right, well, as Loki was saying, part of the reason that Toys R Us maybe put the Wii on their list is that they're not expecting to have a shortage.
2913492	2920455	Nintendo has confirmed they are going to be shipping one million units of the Wii in North America on November 19th.
2920495	2922655	Now, when I say North America, that means, you know, U.S.
2922735	2926917	and Canada, so you Canadians will get some lovin' from Nintendo, too, so no worries.
2928177	2935280	Because, actually, the news came from Nintendo of Canada's vice president, saying, "'We're looking at a million units for North America at launch.'"
2936228	2945635	Now, you may remember that previously our dear friend Reggie said that 4 million Wiis will be out by the end of the year, the majority of them for North America.
2946295	2951319	And now it's confirmed that about 1 million are going to hit North America.
2951939	2953841	And I'm expecting probably another million by the end of the year.
2953901	2959244	Now, there was a late update that suggests that perhaps there might even be more than a million that hit on launch day.
2959404	2960105	Because, you know, I'm thinking...
2960934	2965177	with as huge as people are expecting this to be, a million may not be enough.
2965657	2967638	I would still think they're going to be sold out.
2967758	2970240	Even with a million, they're going to be sold out some places.
2970900	2972822	Yeah, I think they're going to be sold out no matter what.
2972862	2975263	But, you know, at least they're going to have a million units.
2975343	2977905	And a million is a good number to put out there.
2978245	2985850	It's a safe number instead of saying, we're going to have four billion units at launch, you know, and just shipping only four, you know.
2985930	2986190	Yeah.
2987371	2987491	So.
2988208	2988488	I don't know.
2988869	2989709	It should be pretty cool.
2990410	2993472	Some of the cool stuff about the Wii, though, came out this week.
2993632	3011307	Also, talking a little bit about some of the Wii channels, including the Wii Message Board and the new one I haven't heard of, at least, Play History, which Play History is going to be sort of similar to the... kind of like what the 360 has, where you can see the games that people have played and stuff.
3012407	3014089	But I think they're even going to go...
3014520	3022685	To greater detail with that, because originally the play history was supposed to be a way for parents to be able to limit the amount of gaming kids would have.
3023145	3026327	So you'd be able to shut the console off after a certain amount of hours and stuff.
3026507	3030349	Apparently that didn't work out too well, so this came to be instead.
3030469	3038734	So play history will actually be charting a bunch of different stats, of course the majority being your game playing time.
3039133	3044796	Now, the Wii message board is kind of like a little mini, almost email or message board system.
3045457	3055442	You can leave messages for other people that use the Wii, as well as send those messages to mobile phones and, you know, I would imagine PCs and email and that type of stuff.
3055803	3063287	Plus, certain games, say like Animal Crossing, may send you messages as well, you know, so you'd be getting the email's.
3063923	3067746	or the mail from Animal Crossing in your message board.
3067806	3068867	So, it's kind of neat.
3069347	3073090	You know, this whole play history thing is very interesting to me.
3073191	3086821	So, in other words, like, if I'm staying up past my bedtime to play the Wii, if I'm a savvy enough parent, I can go in there and see that, you know, my kid's been up past his bedtime playing the Wii and I can take the cord or, you know, something away.
3086902	3087202	I don't know.
3087222	3088203	That's kind of interesting.
3088243	3089203	What do you guys think about that?
3089263	3091345	Is that a good thing or is that... Sure.
3091365	3092366	Yeah?
3092386	3092466	Yeah.
3092765	3094426	Yeah, I think that's a good thing because you know what?
3094807	3095808	Parents need the tools.
3095928	3104375	If they are having trouble monitoring the amount of gaming their kids have and they want to, I think it's good that they're providing a way for them to be able to do that.
3104575	3105116	And you know what?
3105176	3107998	Whether they use that or not, that's kind of up to them.
3108078	3110320	But at least Nintendo is providing you tools.
3110420	3116285	Same thing with the lockouts for different content based on the content ratings.
3116686	3120389	If they have those parental locks in place, at least they're providing them the tools
3120759	3121260	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3144011	3144511	It's the same.
3144531	3148132	Well, if it's tracking it in the play history, I mean, it's always connected to the internet.
3148192	3149933	How do you feel about TiVo tracking what you watch?
3150313	3152994	I mean, I'm just, I actually, well, I'm just, I'm playing Devil's Advocate here.
3153034	3155375	I don't think it's a big deal because 360 does the same thing.
3155575	3156235	You know it does.
3156695	3157096	Who cares?
3157116	3160077	Because you can see the last five games you've played and it's, you know, I'm sure.
3160117	3165078	Unless they come out with like, you know, some nasty ass porn games, you know, then whatever.
3165218	3165719	Who cares?
3166439	3167439	So they know what I'm playing.
3167499	3167939	Big deal.
3167959	3169840	Okay.
3170818	3171318	Just curious.
3171699	3185466	I do think that there is an advantage in checking it in terms of, especially if you've got your general region in terms of demographics, they'll know what games are being played more in what areas, who to market to, what to market.
3186187	3199854	I actually think that if they use it for their sales, from a sales perspective, it can really increase their profit by gearing toward the different audiences, seeing who's playing the most of what.
3200834	3205918	DarkTetsuya says, Gal's Panic on Xbox Live Arcade.
3206438	3208240	I can only hope someday.
3209481	3211082	I want Gal's Panic on DS.
3211102	3211783	Not necessarily, I think.
3211803	3212643	Yeah, they track through sales.
3226184	3228646	But sales doesn't tell you exactly who's playing what.
3228666	3229906	It would be an interesting comparison.
3230187	3232528	Sure, people bought this, but how long are they actually playing it?
3233548	3233929	That's my point.
3233949	3235509	Before they sold it back to GameStop.
3235549	3236350	That's my point.
3236390	3251598	I think if you see what type of games have the most playability, what's going to have the most longevity, then they're going to be able to say, okay, well, we put this here, and then we say, do you want to keep renewing your experience on this game?
3251678	3253239	Here is X add-on.
3254215	3255076	You know what I just realized?
3255136	3257318	Nintendo's already tracking what games you play on the DS.
3257718	3264024	Because if you go to NintendoWiFi.com, it shows the most popular Wi-Fi games and the last 20 people that played them and everything.
3264921	3270002	You know, Nintendo's been, quote-unquote, violating your privacy in that way for some time, but I don't think it's a big deal.
3270022	3272403	I think violating privacy is posting your pictochat.
3272883	3273123	Yeah.
3273623	3275623	You know, having big pictures of, like, a bunch of cocks up.
3275763	3281824	Or, you know, if I moon one of our listeners on Uno on Xbox Live Arcade, I wouldn't want Microsoft to post that on the interweb.
3281964	3283105	Free on Xbox Live!
3283285	3284145	Rob's ass!
3286585	3287666	Sorry, sorry.
3287726	3289526	It's a theme that you can download this week.
3289546	3291406	I would not download the Rob's ass theme, sorry.
3291426	3293347	I would not allow it to be distributed.
3294167	3294527	Anyway...
3295498	3296999	This is something much more exciting.
3297279	3302822	I squeed like a little girl and probably did run around the house naked when I read this news.
3302842	3306864	When I saw this and I posted it, I knew that you'd be squealing like a little girl.
3307044	3308505	This made me squeal like a little girl.
3309645	3311226	There's a rumor out there.
3311246	3316729	I don't know if it's rumor or fact or what's going on, but Commodore 64 is supposed to be joining the Wii Virtual Console lineup.
3318121	3324745	I played so much, like Commodore 64 was my gaming system in that period between the 2600 and the NES for me.
3325146	3326947	Like, oh my god, this makes me so happy.
3328248	3341536	Gamasutra is reporting that the virtual console update says that no game titles are specified, but there are indications that classic epics titles, games like California Games, Summer Games, Impossible Mission, and Jumpman, oh!
3342193	3343234	may make an appearance.
3343474	3344635	Ooh, I love you, my Jumpman.
3344875	3345396	Oh, God.
3346057	3350520	And they announced this a matter of time before they announced, like, you know, M-U-L-E, pinball construction set.
3350540	3352802	Jumpman was my game on the Coleco.
3352923	3354224	That's what I used to play all the time.
3354304	3357326	Well, now, what's interesting is that when Kotaku posted this story, one of their...
3358127	3358887	Thank you for watching.
3358907	3359368	See you next time.
3375275	3383945	Quote, a Nintendo Power editor merely speculated the announced Commodore 64 games would come to the Virtual Console when in fact two are being remade for the PSP, DS, and Wii.
3384605	3389471	To quote, System 3 will release Impossible Mission on the PSP and DS in January of 07.
3389751	3394136	Three weeks later it will come to Wii with California games for PSP and DS in May of 07.
3394416	3396158	And again three weeks later it will come to the Wii.
3396979	3397139	Huh.
3397622	3409786	You know, either way, no matter where these games are coming, I'm just really excited to see some Commodore 64 love in this era of gaming, because damn, I loved me some Impossible Mission, although that game was impossible as fuck.
3409846	3411446	It was called Impossible Mission for a reason.
3411466	3412086	It was so hard.
3412826	3414407	I want the old Apple IIe games.
3415527	3416287	Like Oregon Trail?
3416728	3416868	Yeah.
3416888	3418608	Are you waiting for Oregon Trail to come to Virtual Con?
3418628	3419248	Gnarly Golf.
3419428	3421969	And I want old school kicks.
3422009	3425050	That was my favorite game, Gnarly Golf, on the Apple IIe.
3426013	3430977	And yes, I did play Apple way back in the day when that was the only option for actual gaming.
3431398	3432679	Which is ironic, I mean.
3433639	3438764	You guys, I still sometimes dust off the Atari 5200 just to play kicks.
3439885	3440485	That's pretty cool.
3441186	3449673	Alright, well, you know, with all this Wii Virtual Console news, I'm sure someday you'll be able to send us messages on the Wii and they'll come up on our screen.
3449957	3450277	DarkSakura.com
3474929	3480274	Well, my actual favorite email out of this lot came from Warrior Bob, but it's really, really freaking long.
3480834	3485819	So, if you don't mind, I'm going to post it up on the forums because it is really long.
3486619	3488881	You know, just really long emails get posted on the forum.
3488901	3489302	How about that?
3490479	3492340	Um, anyway, got one from Mekar.
3492720	3501145	Wait, was the Warrior Bob one, the really long one, and then like, you know, he's making, he's talking about, you know, the next gen gaming, and then at the very end it says, so in conclusion, Byright sucks.
3502166	3504927	In conclusion, that's exactly what it says, in conclusion, Byright sucks.
3504947	3506128	That made me crack up when I read it.
3508334	3509855	But I like this last line, though.
3509915	3515358	I can assure you that years from now, I'll still be playing something really, really old alongside my newest, shiniest game.
3515878	3517179	I actually should put that out there.
3517379	3520081	We're no longer going to be asking your permission to post your letters.
3520221	3526424	If you send us something to Orange Lounge Radio's mailbag, here on out, you've been warned we might post it on our forums.
3527245	3532007	But out of respect, unless you want us to, we will post nicknames but not real names.
3532087	3532388	Yeah, yeah.
3533448	3534809	To protect the not-so-innocent.
3536109	3541373	Anyway, Meklar wrote in, I started listening to Orange Ones Radio last week on your 200th episode.
3541814	3544776	I must say it was my first podcast and I haven't laughed so much in ages.
3544896	3548339	God, what a one to have as your first one.
3549240	3553543	Just to say thanks for putting out a great show and it's nice to see a US show mentioning the UK.
3554084	3557006	I also have to admit that you guys were responsible for me purchasing an Xbox 360.
3557326	3563752	I'd heard some okay stuff about it, but hearing all the good stuff you guys were saying about Saints Row and Dead Rising got me interested.
3563912	3564092	Wow.
3565313	3566874	The live arcade information sold me.
3567434	3573897	So on Friday I went out and spent the 365 pounds on 360 and Dead Rising and Saints Row.
3574297	3575417	I'm so happy I got it.
3575477	3575838	It rules.
3576038	3576298	Thanks.
3576578	3577198	So thanks, guys.
3577638	3581880	Couldn't they just slice the price by five pounds so a 360 would be 360 pounds?
3582500	3582820	Duh.
3582840	3583361	That'd be funny.
3583841	3584241	Yeah, I know.
3584301	3584961	I mean, come on.
3585001	3590884	It's five pounds, which I realize is like, you know, seven or eight bucks US, but still it's not that much.
3591424	3591544	So.
3592451	3600536	That's a very nice compliment that somebody would go out and make that kind of investment based on what we've said.
3600576	3604538	It's even more so the investment in the UK because things are more expensive over there.
3604638	3606299	So that's a very nice compliment.
3606319	3610021	It's very interesting since it's all lies.
3610121	3610801	We love the 360.
3611982	3612322	What?
3613303	3614984	I think you are drunk.
3616024	3618986	Our next email doesn't actually have a nickname on it, so I'm just going to say it's from Sean.
3619006	3619086	Sean?
3620250	3621091	Hello, OLR.
3621251	3625114	I wanted to first wish all of you a happy belated 200th episode.
3625554	3629477	I've been listening to your show for forever, but haven't really interacted until just now.
3629858	3631979	Just felt like thanking you guys for being awesome.
3633280	3634661	I saw you guys at B3 and everything.
3634681	3635522	You guys are the best.
3636042	3637664	Anyway, just wanted to know...
3639182	3642805	What are your thoughts on microtransactions and games in general?
3643346	3654916	And also an opinion on the news that Gran Turismo HD will be almost entirely microtransaction based costing only the cost of the disc and packaging but with the premium mode having a few tracks and cards available from the start.
3654936	3658059	In my opinion it defeats the purpose of having the game to begin with
3658479	3664322	as I always play the Gran Turismo games to rack up huge amounts of money and unlock new tracks and cars and whatnots and just have fun.
3664862	3668023	I don't want to have to actively make purchasing decisions for a game.
3668463	3670724	I just want to pay my 50 to 60 bucks and be done with it.
3671205	3686051	And while I understand that this is a popular trend in Korean MMOs such as MapleStory and Pangya Golf, those games actually have content that you can earn which makes playing them fun and having the purchasable items as a bonus to look cool only.
3686776	3694141	I want to be able to earn cars just like I've been doing for the last four GTs instead of their new version of a game where you play it only for a few minutes a day.
3694521	3698964	I just wanted to know your thoughts on it and let you know that you guys rock and I hope you keep podcasting into the future.
3699004	3699285	Thanks.
3699825	3700165	Thank you.
3700405	3701766	I think this is funny.
3701806	3705089	Haz in our chat room says micro-rapeman is more like it.
3706209	3711393	I do have to say the micro-transaction thing for a racing game, I was going back and thinking about it, you know.
3712219	3720605	and if it's trying to... The point of Gran Turismo was the point of putting you into a realistic racing situation, right?
3721026	3727571	Well, if you are a professional racer, you are going to go out and spend money to buy your cars, to buy your upgraded parts.
3727591	3728792	You are going to go shopping.
3729812	3737178	If the point of Gran Turismo is to reflect the more realistic side of racing, then that makes sense.
3738860	3740721	I'm okay with microtransactions.
3740801	3745743	I think in certain types of games and certain ways that it's used, it's actually pretty cool.
3745803	3749505	For instance, new songs in DDR and Karaoke Revolution and those games.
3749945	3752466	New maps and shooter games like Halo 2.
3752526	3756949	In fact, I really like the way Halo 2 did it where for a while it was pay and then it was free.
3756989	3758949	But of course, I'm going to love anything that's free.
3759710	3761291	I think it's good for new tracks and things.
3761591	3766333	For me, it's about when I buy the initial game,
3766857	3767858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3789136	3790216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3815626	3844308	because they knew right away that there's going to be lots of microtransactions but you do not need to buy them to be able to enjoy the game the way they're making Gran Turismo HD sound oh by the way if you want to play online you've got to buy the cars first so that's kind of fucked up I think right there so why am I buying this game again and to be honest I've seen the video of Gran Turismo HD apparently the premium one or whatever I'm not impressed by it at all and I think
3845293	3846674	I think it would be a waste of money to buy it.
3846894	3847515	But you know what?
3847535	3850537	If you're a huge fan of Gran Turismo, then yeah, go ahead and purchase that game.
3850657	3855841	But I think it's a mistake to expect you to purchase cars before you can race online.
3855961	3856742	I think that's dumb.
3857322	3860385	I think that you should be able to have a sponsor on your car.
3861005	3861806	And then you don't have to pay.
3863548	3866149	Your sponsor pays for your purchase.
3866169	3866929	And free advertising.
3867229	3867569	That is retarded.
3891323	3896646	I think Joystick reviewed it at X06 and didn't exactly have the brightest things to say about that, which is a little disappointing.
3896946	3903289	I liked it when I played it at E3, but it's going to come down to what am I going to get for the base price.
3903329	3908652	I'm not going to buy the game just to have to microtransaction it out to really get the full feel out of it.
3909738	3913300	Well, to move on to our next email unless we've got anything more to add.
3913520	3913840	Not really.
3914180	3915661	Oh wait, here's one interesting chat comment.
3915761	3920864	Bandit says, what if you could earn real life gas for your car by winning races in Turismo?
3921424	3921924	Not likely.
3922324	3924085	Not likely, but it would be an interesting tie-in.
3924105	3937232	See, I think what they should do if they really want to have realism in the game is that you actually earn actual, well not actual, but like comparable money in their game environment and have to pay for your gas and pay your crew and
3937785	3940526	and pay to buy your new stuff.
3940666	3941786	That should be how they do it.
3942346	3945227	One more quick chat comment and then we'll let DarkSakura get to the next email.
3945267	3950548	FootyMonster says, If the game is going to be gimped because you don't have the extra content, then that's wrong.
3951049	3953769	What you got off the shelves should be enough to enjoy.
3954410	3954850	I agree.
3955270	3959731	And also I'd like to give FootyMonster a big hello for listening in from Argentina.
3960151	3961351	We love our worldwide audience.
3961631	3962232	Absolutely.
3962252	3965252	We love our domestic audience too, but we love the worldwide audience as well.
3965793	3967053	Our next one comes from Matt.
3971268	3977350	Hey ORL Long time listener to your great podcast, but this is my first time writing in.
3977950	3985132	I just got done writing Xbox about how disappointed I was when I attempted playing Uno for the first time since they added that god awful contraption called The Vision.
3985792	3987313	Never have I been so appalled.
3987773	3994075	If seeing underage boys showing their wee and masturbating wasn't enough, I actually saw this one guy shooting up an unknown drug.
3994730	3996772	Why is Microsoft allowing this behavior to happen?
3996792	4004258	It's really discrediting them as a serious game platform anymore.
4004919	4015908	I guess with Sony's and Microsoft's recent bad management decisions, I guess I'll have to trade in my Xbox 360 and pre-order the only Wii that I want to see and play with, Nintendo's new system.
4016609	4019712	At least I know that they wouldn't allow this type of behavior to happen on their network.
4019772	4021313	Please let me know what you guys think of this.
4021353	4022394	Thanks and keep up the great work.
4023049	4027771	For whenever there is a camera peripheral, you can better believe you're going to see someone naked.
4028171	4029971	That is just the fact.
4030131	4031912	That's nothing that they have control over.
4031952	4036073	I don't want to see some freaking 16 or 17-year-old person running around naked on their camera.
4036093	4036753	That's illegal.
4036873	4037254	Hello?
4038494	4040054	That's not okay.
4040094	4042055	That's non-consensual.
4042995	4045016	I'm being raped with these images.
4045056	4046036	Here's the other thing, too.
4047317	4048077	Here's what they should have.
4048658	4054485	They should have an option for each player, if you do not want to view that, that you can shut the window off.
4055086	4055466	Don't they?
4055646	4056427	I'm not sure.
4056527	4058530	I don't have the camera still, so you've got to tell me.
4058950	4059271	I don't know.
4059311	4062655	I've only played Uno once on live with the camera.
4063399	4064840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4089781	4091642	Johnny, why did you get banned from Xbox Live?
4119853	4120193	I don't know.
4121174	4123636	Eddie says it's probably in the parental controls.
4123756	4127398	Also, Actdeft says, I can star rate you and I'm not afraid to use it.
4127599	4128259	You know what, though?
4128439	4130481	I still think it makes Uno edgier.
4132342	4135324	It makes me want to play it more because of the naked chicks.
4136044	4139207	But they're, that's gross because some of them are like 16 and 17.
4139367	4140328	What are you going to do?
4140488	4142509	Ask each one, you know, when they're about to take their top off?
4142729	4143170	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4143470	4143950	Yay, team.
4144791	4145491	Sure I am.
4146572	4147052	Continue.
4149154	4149454	I don't,
4150512	4151453	You know, I don't know.
4151993	4152473	Come on!
4152493	4160439	There's a difference between someone flashing their butt really quick and someone jerking it off on camera.
4160459	4161380	That's disgusting.
4161400	4164622	If I want to see that, there's websites I can go to for that.
4164702	4166003	Microsoft does not care.
4166343	4166883	Transcontroller?
4191621	4197364	You know, maybe our particular emailer here has just been lucky, quote-unquote, in what they've been seeing.
4197865	4201587	Wonderdog Harold in our chatroom says, I've been playing tons of Uno, and I haven't seen anything obscene.
4201647	4202067	Exactly.
4202868	4205109	Well, I played one game of Uno, and that wasn't obscene.
4205149	4207771	I've seen, like, one person using a camera, and that's it.
4208071	4212894	I think it's funny when I see cameras, because usually they're pointing at really weird things, like someone's cat.
4213034	4214475	You know, just, like, fun stuff.
4214635	4216276	Dude, we should put Shermie on the camera.
4217987	4219188	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4235324	4237265	Do the ultra-warn thing that notifies Microsoft.
4237285	4237706	That's not cool.
4237726	4239467	And why are people just leaving the games and stuff?
4239527	4247474	If you see some pre-teen masturbating on camera, why are people kicking them out of the game or just saying, fuck this, I'm out of here?
4247654	4249316	I guess that's one option.
4249336	4250056	Host your own games.
4250216	4252198	Look, boobies.
4252318	4253119	That's a good option.
4253199	4256942	Host your own games, and then you have control over booting people out when they're doing something stupid.
4257322	4258643	So, things to think about.
4259124	4262186	We got an email from Bradley, who...
4263413	4264533	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4286229	4313031	but what's coming out with it is that Chain of Memories remake for the PS2 which we may not get there's a petition going around now at khinsider.com the link there will say KH2FM plus COM petition contact campaign just wanting to get the Chain of Memories remake released out here
4313840	4318824	Just showing interest to Sony, to Squeenix actually, that gamers in the U.S.
4318884	4319205	wants it.
4319765	4320726	So that's that I'd make a mention.
4321667	4324850	Maybe it's something they could pack in with Kingdom Hearts 3 in the future?
4325110	4325470	I don't know.
4325690	4326711	A stretch?
4326831	4327192	I don't know.
4327392	4332756	I think they should do like a $20 release and say, here you go, here's Chain of Memories.
4333017	4334838	Oh, like when they release it as a budget game?
4334858	4336259	Maybe throw that in as a pack-in?
4337160	4338201	Not necessarily that.
4338221	4340803	I'm just saying maybe release it as a standalone budget game.
4340983	4341504	That would be cool.
4342393	4343053	I would pay for it.
4343073	4345814	I've been playing Chain of Memories on my micro.
4346074	4346954	I'd be interested to see.
4346974	4349814	Chain of Memories is a pain in the ass to play on the micro, by the way.
4349854	4350374	I'll be honest.
4350414	4351895	I haven't really played Chain of Memories at all.
4351935	4354915	I kind of skipped it, but I would check it out.
4355075	4361216	I don't do a lot of gaming on Game Boy Advance, especially games of that length.
4361296	4361636	I don't know.
4361676	4365257	They're just more TV games for me, so I would definitely check it out if it was on PlayStation 2.
4365297	4366837	So I'd like to see that.
4366937	4367457	I'll sign it.
4368237	4370878	I'd just probably import it, but that's me.
4371098	4371458	You know me.
4372508	4373589	Got one from JeremyTodd1.
4373869	4374150	Hi.
4375010	4377172	Hey, OLR, it's JeremyTodd1, like I just said.
4377713	4380535	I haven't sent an email in for a while, so why don't I send one now?
4380735	4381456	I don't know why don't you?
4381656	4386840	He's been getting a lot of FaceTime tonight with the comments and everything, but that's fine.
4387441	4392505	Did you ever think that Microsoft and the makers of the games is ripping us off with the arcade games?
4393044	4393204	MSN BAH
4419833	4422236	and yes, I know I'm a sucker because I keep buying these games.
4422296	4424179	My name is JeremyTodd1 and I have a problem.
4425281	4428485	Yeah, but could you see your friend masturbating and shooting up drugs on MSN Messenger?
4428565	4428986	I think not.
4429566	4430528	That's a plus.
4432370	4433311	No, seriously, um,
4434542	4435704	You know, it's the same.
4435724	4437165	You can play Zuma for free online.
4437185	4438507	You can play Bejeweled for free online.
4438547	4440149	Yeah, we're suckers for these games anyway.
4440449	4444754	They're pretty on the TV in a way that they're not in the little window in the computer.
4445075	4449160	And there's something to be said about the achievements and voice chat, multiplayer, and all that crap.
4449340	4449921	I don't know.
4450762	4451523	We are suckers.
4452043	4453345	But five bucks isn't that much either.
4453685	4454186	It's really not.
4455670	4457771	I could buy groceries with that!
4458171	4459972	Crackers and sardines for a week!
4459992	4462613	Yeah, you could buy, like, two boxes of Hot Pockets.
4462853	4463553	That's about it.
4463814	4465054	Mmm, Hot Pocket.
4465374	4466715	Okay, two emails left.
4467395	4468916	One's from Steven NZ.
4469776	4474498	Hey everyone, love the show like always, and before I start, I know that my grammar is...
4475211	4476632	Not up to scratch, lol.
4476912	4477513	Oh, wait, hold on.
4477553	4479294	Can I say this one comment on the last email real quick?
4479494	4480035	No, that's fine.
4480055	4480435	This is good.
4480795	4485118	BootyMonster says, Sky, it just makes it more accessible for everyone in the house.
4485779	4486519	Interesting perspective.
4486699	4488060	I just want to say that.
4488180	4488841	I was joking.
4489581	4495246	To continue, I just wanted to ask you guys which is better, out of a plasma or LCD TV for gaming?
4495646	4498288	And we'll go ahead and ask that first question.
4498828	4501090	I have an LCD widescreen, and I like it.
4501750	4503772	Plasma does have...
4504434	4507555	Well, especially from having dealt with plasma monitors for Beatmania.
4508835	4512496	They did sort of die after a while of constant use.
4514597	4516877	I was going to get into this in the FUs of the week.
4517878	4521218	I had a, I think it's CRT, is that what they call the big boxes?
4522059	4527860	I had a CRT, but I was forced to upgrade this week and I now have an LCD.
4529241	4529621	It's pretty.
4530121	4530601	I like LCDs.
4532287	4533288	I'm getting used to it still.
4533328	4535388	The sound is bothering me on this new TV, though.
4535428	4538649	I can't get it just right like I had on the old one, so that's the only thing that's bothering me.
4538669	4539389	But the picture's pretty.
4540290	4540590	It's pretty.
4540930	4541550	Loki, what about you?
4541570	4541950	What do you have?
4541970	4542690	You have an LCD, right?
4542751	4543291	I have an LCD.
4544451	4555595	Actually, to go ahead and continue, and this next question is probably more for Loki, but I was wondering how long it would take for a stationary image to burn into an HDMI plasma screen as I don't want to damage my new TV.
4556295	4559356	I don't think plasmas have the problem with burn-in anymore.
4559376	4559416	Um,
4561641	4562501	Not if you get a new one.
4562541	4565142	I remember the older ones having issues with it.
4566282	4570703	Yeah, I don't think it's really an issue anymore.
4570963	4573664	But apparently pretty quick from what I heard before.
4574464	4577465	But I don't think, like I said, I think they've fixed that now.
4578065	4582526	You know what I don't get, and I'll probably have some tech junkie sending me hate mail over this, but oh well.
4583306	4584466	Projection televisions.
4584666	4585807	I don't like those at all.
4586007	4589608	Like the ones that look weird if you're looking at it too high or too low, they don't look right.
4589868	4591208	I don't get those TVs at all.
4591897	4593218	I would never put one of those in my house.
4594298	4596519	I'm sure that's going to incite some hate mail.
4596579	4598319	I'm not a fan, personally.
4598560	4599540	That's an opinion, people.
4599760	4605462	Although I have to say, I saw my first non-video game example of Burnin' yesterday.
4606202	4611184	I went to the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum in San Francisco and one of their screens had Major Burnin'.
4612025	4615726	Because they play the same thing over and over about blowing your cheeks up like Dizzy Gillespie.
4616947	4620488	To continue with email, I'm just all over the place today.
4621562	4622882	Last one comes from DMN.
4622983	4624823	Yes, we saved you for last.
4625743	4626264	Pet, pet.
4627744	4630965	All the same people managing to get on this show in different ways.
4631265	4633566	Calls, chats, emails.
4633686	4637527	Well, you know, if you're sitting at home going, why do all these people keep getting on the show?
4637567	4639828	Well, you know, you could send us an email and you could get on the show.
4640088	4641369	Just make sure it's intelligent.
4641749	4642189	Absolutely.
4644050	4644730	Hey, OLR.
4645270	4646811	It's always great to be able to listen to you guys.
4646851	4648031	I appreciate the opinions.
4648493	4651195	To which I generally agree with you guys upon, keep up the good work.
4651455	4653056	I do write, however, regarding Sony.
4653876	4662681	I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but in the past two console generations, we can all agree that Sony has prevailed over the other competitors, PS1 over the N64 and Saturn.
4663281	4664542	Not in Japan, necessarily, though.
4665242	4670686	PS2 over the GameCube and Xbox and Dreamcast.
4671446	4676649	This reminds me a lot of Nintendo back in the 80s and 90s when they dominated with the NES and Super NES.
4677059	4677579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4695140	4697081	for gaming with the 64.
4697622	4702225	Nintendo reeled from that blow for quite a while and are now taking a step in the right direction and being innovative.
4702705	4705287	Mind, I bash Sony a lot, but I do not want to see them fail.
4705647	4714434	I love the PS1 as well as the PS2, but I think that the fact that the two console generations of success have gone to their heads and going to send them further downhill.
4715014	4722359	And the problem with that is that if the PS3 fails, Blu-ray is likely to, and Sony will have nothing back to fall on.
4722859	4723160	I hope...
4724594	4732700	Hirai, Stringer, and Kuragi strongly think about their business plan for the PS3 because it might be the last thing that Sony ever does.
4732780	4734101	Thanks for reading and keep up the good work.
4735542	4740005	It's an interesting comparison to make, but the one problem I have with it is that the PSP is no Virtual Boy.
4740746	4744468	I think the PSP is a much better system than the Virtual Boy was.
4744669	4746450	The Virtual Boy just had some fundamental problems with it.
4746750	4748852	The PSP is just kind of a different thing.
4749112	4750773	It's games and movies and music.
4751260	4753181	Remember, Kutaragi eats crayons and wears a helmet.
4771468	4772209	Was that the last email?
4772269	4772829	That was it.
4773009	4774930	Alright, then you could send us some emails as well.
4774990	4778633	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com More news while we're running along this segment.
4778653	4781715	We still have DDR previews to get to, so let's run through the next bit of news.
4781815	4793583	Yes, and I'm sure this came as a first for everybody that heard it, but apparently there was a press release done by Bethesda saying, guess what?
4794764	4797285	Elder Scrolls Oblivion is coming out on the PSP and PS3.
4797305	4797466	Okay.
4800148	4801069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4826045	4828105	and also that the date would be April 07.
4829006	4831206	We mentioned that back on episode 196?
4831246	4831766	Yeah, okay.
4831826	4837007	Yes, but we cannot confirm those rumors until it's on the cover of our magazine.
4837367	4838027	Yeah, exactly.
4838387	4855110	Once it gets printed in the official PlayStation magazine, thank you very much, 1up.com, which I might add, there is an article in OPM that says, if any game is worth the price of a PlayStation 3, Oblivion is it.
4856980	4857060	Hey!
4885469	4887290	If you want to buy us out of our day jobs, sure.
4888311	4890852	I have editorial experience and writing.
4891032	4893394	Again, if you want to buy us out of our day jobs, sure.
4893414	4895455	Hi, Jamie's in college for this.
4895575	4903600	Like I said earlier in the show, and I'm going to repeat this every single episode until this actual story comes out somewhere else.
4904260	4906842	Fall Auto 2 on PSP in March.
4907182	4908422	You heard it here first.
4909943	4910784	You've got issues, Loki.
4912193	4941706	well as also in regards to people who have issues as I mentioned we all know Kutaragi eats crayons licks wall candy wears a bicycle helmet now he has earned himself a leash yes he has to be strapped to the playground so that he does not run off when he was asked if the rival consoles will outstrip Sony's PS3 Kutaragi said we do not care
4943396	4949881	He did, though, admit that they are struggling with the Blu-ray drive production, but they're wanting to resolve it.
4950302	4955646	Now, I have to say, though, that Phil Harrison, I think that he also has issues with crayons.
4955986	4968776	He at least eats the wrappers on the crayons, because when he was asked if they have a launch lineup yet, to quote, we're at a fluid time when games are in Final QA, but not out of Final QA, but we're close.
4969537	4970358	So, in other words, no.
4970378	4971138	Just say no.
4971298	4971899	Just say no.
4972785	4974986	You don't have to give the special boy answer.
4975946	4980328	Go back and eat your... We should just send Kutaragi and Harrison, like, some Crayolas.
4980668	4981088	Do you want to?
4981609	4981949	Yeah.
4982409	4982869	Orange ones.
4983169	4984970	Okay, let's figure out their address or whatever.
4985450	4985990	We'll send them some.
4986511	4987771	Here's some Crayons for you to eat.
4988071	4989032	We think you ran out.
4990372	4990912	Oh, God.
4991192	4992753	Stupid, stupid Sony.
4993633	4994474	I don't think he would get it.
4994494	4996234	I think he's too dumb for that stuff.
4996795	4998195	They just make you Crayons.
4999636	5000116	Anyways.
5000136	5002117	So...
5002947	5004528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5033775	5041942	Speaking of hacks and leaks, it's being said that Gears of War has been pirated and uploaded to Usenet.
5042462	5045324	It's 7.2 gigs and 157 parts.
5045565	5047766	It will take a long time to download.
5048547	5053411	The thing is, it takes so long to download that nobody really knows if this is legitimate or not.
5053971	5055072	It could be a bunch of crap.
5055413	5059736	But certainly interesting that this would have already hit the internet when the game is not supposed to be out for a month.
5060236	5061517	Uh-oh, that could be bad.
5061838	5063279	I don't think it's legit.
5063659	5064939	from what I've heard so far.
5065139	5066260	Could be a beta build or something.
5066280	5070581	And to be honest, 7.2 gigs, that doesn't take that long to download on Usenet.
5071501	5072561	Not that I would know or anything.
5077343	5078983	Sorry, I got the giggles there for a second.
5079523	5082864	Anyways, some interesting stuff though.
5083306	5085048	Tetsuya Mizuguchi Tetsuya Mizuguchi
5108945	5110606	New things with new technology.
5110906	5115209	So, possibly a new Rez game on next-gen console.
5115389	5115789	Vibrator 2.0.
5116370	5117390	That would be pretty sweet.
5117871	5119211	I'm looking forward to it.
5119331	5123034	I mean, I would like a trans... Hi!
5123754	5124375	Look, the ferret.
5125915	5130959	Interesting comment in chatroom from FootyMonster in regards to the Gears of War piracy story.
5131319	5133020	It has happened before, Skye.
5133060	5137362	Shenmue 2 on Dreamcast was four CDs and got leaked three weeks before the release date.
5137983	5138123	Hmm.
5140069	5140489	Interesting.
5142330	5152194	Alright, well that's going to do it for the news here in this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we have some more exciting stuff to get to, and that would be our DDR previews.
5152254	5159317	That's right, for the past few weeks we've been premiering new tracks from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4, as well as DDR Universe.
5160097	5163419	Going to be coming out for the Xbox and the Xbox 360 a little later this year.
5163919	5163979	D.D.R.
5163999	5164219	Ultramix 4
5194042	5197368	of Beyond Here and Now here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5197588	5198289	Power Previews.
5251115	5251418	and more.
5442825	5443345	Thanks for watching!
5472981	5476723	Here on the DDR Sneak Peek set as Naropa with Beyond Here and Now.
5476783	5478885	Now that is the full version we just played for you guys.
5479185	5486709	Keep in mind when that song actually shows up in DDR, it'll be cut down to the typical DDR length of about a minute and a half, two minutes, whatever they decide on.
5487089	5489171	But I love the 80s-ness of that song.
5489211	5491932	And somebody in the chatroom had the balls to say that song was too 80s.
5491972	5493673	And I say you can never have enough 80s.
5494234	5498316	And Standing Still in Time was kind of one of my favorite sleeper songs in Ultramix 2.
5498356	5501558	A lot of people didn't talk about that song, but it was still one of my favorites to play, so
5502311	5504752	I'm looking forward to seeing how that one turns out in the final mix of the game.
5520956	5524000	by one of the familiar faces from Konami of Japan.
5524380	5526322	So I bet you guys are going to get a kick out of this.
5526823	5529866	Here's the next song in our DDR sneak peeks from DDR Ultramix 4.
5530267	5535713	This is Jondi and Spech with Insaner, the LEDs punishment mix.
5536154	5539497	That's right, I said LED here on the sneak peeks.
5539678	5539978	Enjoy.
5559871	5561562	and any home star with mechanical failings.
5641221	5646225	Insaner, that's LED's punishment mix by Jondi and Spech here on the DDR Sneak Peeks.
5646885	5649347	Boy, that step chart's going to be a killer, you think?
5650028	5652009	You think that step chart might just make you die?
5652029	5653410	Yeah, it'll be a little tough.
5653850	5654831	But that's a great song.
5654971	5661936	As folks in the chatroom are saying, it's Strong Jaeger plus Insaner, so that should be kind of interesting.
5661976	5662356	It's very LED.
5664011	5668413	Alright, let's get to another Johnny and Spesh track because that's what we've got lined up for you next.
5668473	5670875	It's another song from DDR Universe.
5671335	5672836	This song is called Loops.
5673336	5675337	Enjoy this one here on the DDR Sneak Peeks.
5675737	5676058	Loops
5683198	5684058	Let's do it again!
5714316	5715577	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5746409	5746789	and many more.
5782128	5788012	That is Loops by John D. and Spesh coming soon to DDR Universe here on the DDR Sneak Peaks Orange Lounge Radio.
5788393	5794577	We've got one more song for you guys tonight, and it's a song that comes to you from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4.
5794918	5799041	It's by an artist named Richard Devine, or maybe that's Devin?
5799101	5799761	No, I think it's Devine.
5801242	5803404	And the song is called Sig Rev 2.
5803924	5805886	That's right, S-I-G-R-E-V 2.
5806646	5808728	Just run that all together, and that's the name of the song.
5809468	5811530	So check it out here on the DDR Sneak Peaks.
5911821	5915767	and SigRev2 here on the DDR Sneak Peeks and that's going to do it for this week.
5916428	5917490	That was an interesting song.
5918391	5920113	Kind of sounds like old school beat mania.
5920153	5921415	That's what you were saying in the chair, huh?
5921495	5924860	Yeah, what I just said is that it's like Paranoia meets Overdozer.
5925101	5925321	Yeah?
5926142	5926623	As in the...
5927671	5929473	Thank you for watching!
5947103	5950285	So it should be some fun mixes coming out later this year.
5950805	5951145	All right.
5951786	5960991	Now, instead of actually going to break right now, we actually had some last-minute stories we wanted to add here into Part A. A little behind-the-scenes look at Orange Lounge Radio.
5961551	5967915	Every Sunday, we usually compile all the blogs that we've seen and all the stories that we want to do.
5968195	5973878	We compile it into this big list that we call our show role, and usually it's pretty much set in stone, and we don't mess with it too much, but...
5974238	5975258	DarkSakura, Doki Doki Majo Saiban
5995063	5998365	which is a game where you look for witches hiding on the earth.
5998725	6006851	And the way that you find out who is a witch and who is not a witch is you touch them in special locations.
6007931	6013495	The image from... I'll link the blog in the chat room that there's a lot of images posted on.
6014055	6018658	But it has pictures of boobs with X marks on them so they didn't find a witch there.
6018778	6022060	It's like... I'm getting...
6023278	6027961	The little Monty Python fangirl in my head is going, how do you know she's a witch?
6028081	6029582	She's just like one!
6029902	6032704	We have Fireboma in chat going, and then you burn them!
6033644	6035646	Ah, but what do you burn apart from witches?
6035986	6036926	More witches!
6037447	6038587	Build a bridge out of her!
6040048	6040328	Yeah.
6041729	6043110	We've already got a chair room going off on it.
6043190	6045852	But that's my impression, except, like, porn game?
6047353	6048974	So a porn game involving witches?
6049634	6052696	It's not, it's just, it's like,
6054022	6057845	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6073484	6079906	To make a long story short, I was going on, I wanted to see if the show was posted actually, and I pull up my star page's Yahoo.
6080446	6081767	And what do I see in the bottom corner?
6082207	6088269	They do this like top ten list or whatever, and it said top ten video game downloads.
6088949	6092171	And the little picture representing it was porn.
6092531	6093551	And I was like, huh?
6094111	6094691	That's weird.
6095032	6095672	So what did I do?
6095792	6096992	I took a screen cap of it.
6097753	6101694	Of course, later on, about three hours later, they figured out that they're
6102128	6103069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6115706	6140627	Vagina out there in the open and flapping in the wind flapping in the wind and I do have the picture I could and you swear you didn't photoshop this I swear to god I did not photoshop this at all I just use a screen cap program I have the actual web page saved to my computer just you know to make sure but it was hilarious Bandit says in our chat room says yeah I'll believe it when 1up.com reports on it
6145563	6148164	Link, Link, Link Please, Link Please, Link Or It Didn't Happen
6171684	6173506	We have a listless coming your way.
6173666	6177050	If you haven't heard that segment yet, have no idea what we're talking about, stay tuned.
6177070	6183997	We'll be back in a little bit with Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
6184457	6188782	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
