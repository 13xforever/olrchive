00:00.000 --> 00:20.880
Today, October 15th, 2006, more details on the E3 Makeover, PlayStation 3 and Wii's are

00:20.880 --> 00:26.120
pre-ordered around the nation, and what are the annoying things about the next game generation?

00:26.120 --> 00:32.840
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.840 --> 00:38.280
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge

00:38.280 --> 00:39.320
Radio.

00:39.320 --> 00:44.440
We are that internet radio program dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and the

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
gamer lifestyle.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.420
We talk about all sorts of games.

00:47.420 --> 00:51.300
We try to avoid those that suck but, you know, once in a while we've got to talk about games

00:51.300 --> 00:54.760
that suck because we have to tell you to stay the hell away from them.

00:54.760 --> 00:55.760
And I'm here to help you do that.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.760
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:56.760 --> 00:57.760
You might know me as Sky.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.760
Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.760
Hi.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.760
Welcome back.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.000
I am back, aren't I?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.080
Yes, you were off at the Mouse House last week.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.080
For a day.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.320
I was actually, I came back for a funeral.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.320
Oh, that's right.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.320
That's right.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.320
You were, I remember now, so.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.520
And then I fell into a coma for eight hours because I have a sinus infection.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
So sick Jamie's back.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.800
Those folks that have been listening to the podcast for a long time know that Jamie was

01:23.800 --> 01:25.960
sick for a while.

01:25.960 --> 01:30.080
And it started from a sinus infection, so like my doctors all like, okay, pick your

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
antibiotic.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.560
I'm like, I get to choose?

01:34.560 --> 01:39.480
So I'm on erythromycin, which hates my whole digestive system.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.400
I prefer C-Pro, just five tablets, but that's just me.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.080
Anyway, sorry, we're not The Drug Show.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.080
We're Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.080
Aren't we Loki?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.080
Tech Master Loki is also here.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.080
Yes.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.080
Yes.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
How you doing?

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
Yes, we're not The Drug Show.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.080
I like your shirt.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.320
You have a me and my Katamari shirt on.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.320
Yes.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.320
You know, I never played that on PSP.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.440
I just kind of missed it.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.400
Like I know I was looking forward to it and then I was kind of like, eh.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.160
I played it a little bit and got bored.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.160
Did you?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.160
Really quick.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.380
Was it just not, it was not the same on the little screen?

02:04.380 --> 02:08.620
The lack of a second analog stick cramps my hand up very badly.

02:08.620 --> 02:13.880
And so it was just like kind of Metroid Prime Hunter Syndrome where, you know, you just

02:13.880 --> 02:17.760
have to stop playing because it hurts your hand and it's just not, I don't know.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.640
It's like trying to control a car with a brick or something instead of a steering wheel.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
I don't know.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.920
I actually got the urge to play Katamari Damacy yesterday.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.000
I was lying on the couch kind of just, you know, having one of those lazy days where

02:29.000 --> 02:32.640
I'm not going to move from this spot and then I'm looking over at my game collection which

02:32.640 --> 02:37.040
is, you know, kind of next to the TV and then I'm like, I want to roll over things.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.600
I want to play Katamari Damacy.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.400
There's something very stress relieving about that game.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
I can't explain it.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.840
We get that feeling every day during work.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.400
That's why we have to have our killing breaks.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
I see.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.560
Hence the Liberty City stories.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.560
Yes.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.000
We'll be here Gaming Week in just a minute, but I do want to introduce an old favorite

02:55.000 --> 02:58.840
of ours that's sitting here tonight on the ground hacking something on the computer over

02:58.840 --> 02:59.840
there.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.840
Say hello to Miklotov.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.640
It's called chatting online, not hacking.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
What are you chatting on?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.640
It's not our chat room.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.000
No, it's just like instant messenger.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I see.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.360
So you're talking to people better than our listeners.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.360
Yeah, just some coworkers.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.360
Oh, okay.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.960
Well, if you want to join our chat room, www.orangelauntrader.com, click on chat.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.400
Miklotov will be here for a little bit, but you're not going to be here for the whole

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
show, right?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.920
You have a train or a bus to catch or something?

03:23.920 --> 03:24.920
Yeah, something like that.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
All right.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.240
Don't say train.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.120
What's wrong with trains?

03:29.120 --> 03:31.880
Because I told you what I've been listening to all week.

03:31.880 --> 03:35.280
Oh, I'm going to be riding a train very soon, actually.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.280
It's kind of...

03:36.280 --> 03:38.720
If I hear any more Guns N' Roses, I'm going to shoot myself.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.320
All right, well, I suppose we should start talking about the Gaming Weeks, starting off

03:43.320 --> 03:44.320
with Dark Sakura.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.320
How was your Gaming Week?

03:45.320 --> 03:51.380
Full of Guns N' Roses pinball, apparently, because my hubby has seen fit to play a lot

03:51.380 --> 03:53.520
and lots of Guns N' Roses pinballs.

03:53.520 --> 03:58.920
So I either come home to Welcome to the Jungle or Night Train or My Michelle.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.200
And where I love old school...

04:00.200 --> 04:02.280
My Michelle rocks, just for the record.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.280
Yeah.

04:03.280 --> 04:10.440
Where I love Guns N' Roses, there's so much I can hear of Night Train, because Dan always

04:10.440 --> 04:13.500
gets to that level and then music somehow gets louder.

04:13.500 --> 04:18.400
And the thing is, it's like synthesized guitar and everything, like listening to a Super

04:18.400 --> 04:22.800
Nintendo with Axl, you know, all fuzzy over it.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.480
I was like, dude, no.

04:25.480 --> 04:35.800
And I made myself an Xbox Live account, and so I have my own gamertag now.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.800
After all this time, you finally made your own damn account?

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
Because of the PSU demo.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
Yeah.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
Which I haven't played yet.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
I just downloaded it.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
Okay.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.720
But for anyone who wants to know, oh my god, I'm going to regret this.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.520
Go to the forums and look it up.

04:48.520 --> 04:52.160
Yeah, go to the forums and look it up, because I posted it on the gamertag.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.640
See then it's a free advertisement for the forums.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.840
There you go.

04:55.840 --> 05:01.200
And then, this doesn't have to do with anything about, well, actually playing a game, but

05:01.200 --> 05:05.560
it made me think of it since you guys were talking about Katamari, is I had a dream on

05:05.560 --> 05:09.040
like Thursday night that I was rolling a Katamari over my work.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.400
You remember the last time I had dreams about that, right?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.880
I left that job.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
Really?

05:14.880 --> 05:15.880
To another one.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.880
Yeah.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.880
Makes me think of that ad that was on.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.520
I think it was for like a bank or credit card or something that showed the Katamari rolling

05:21.520 --> 05:22.920
down the hills in San Francisco.

05:22.920 --> 05:27.800
I mean, the ad agency denied it was inspired by Katamari, but that's what any gamer would

05:27.800 --> 05:31.360
think about when they see that commercial is, oh, ha ha, Katamari.

05:31.360 --> 05:37.480
Actually, I still have the parody that I made from when I worked at the student loan place,

05:37.480 --> 05:39.560
so I'll post it up in the chat room.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.040
All right.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.040
Yeah.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.880
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:43.880 --> 05:45.600
It was okay.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.880
What did I play?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.000
I didn't play a whole lot.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.920
More Saints Row, because that games are really fun.

05:52.920 --> 06:00.040
I finally stole a Titan, which is an armored car with money in it, and I have been performing

06:00.040 --> 06:05.400
the wonderful money duping glitch that's in the game where you can basically blow this

06:05.400 --> 06:09.680
car up over and over collecting the money in it and buying it over again.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Fun stuff.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.760
Grand Theft Auto, of course, Liberty City Stories, still waiting for Vice City Stories.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.640
Only a few more weeks, a few more weeks, then we can switch games, finally.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.880
And then, other than that, really not a whole lot.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.160
I was meaning to set up my PlayStation 2 and play some games on that, but I need to buy

06:26.160 --> 06:29.760
a VGA cable for it so I can hook it up to my computer because, unfortunately, Nelly

06:29.760 --> 06:31.940
wants to hog the TV with Zuma.

06:31.940 --> 06:32.940
And so, you know...

06:32.940 --> 06:33.940
But she's not a gamer.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.540
No, not at all.

06:35.540 --> 06:37.480
She's a single gamer, I guess.

06:37.480 --> 06:42.260
But so, yeah, unfortunately, I can't really play the games on there, so I have to wait

06:42.260 --> 06:43.260
for that.

06:43.260 --> 06:48.160
I'm packing because I'm moving next week, so that kind of puts a damper on playing games

06:48.160 --> 06:49.160
and stuff.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.280
But I did play a little bit of Dig Dug, which is kind of neat because that came out this

06:52.280 --> 06:53.280
week.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.280
I don't know.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.280
It's just Dig Dug.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.900
I mean, what do you expect?

06:56.900 --> 07:01.240
And then, tried a little bit more of Need for Speed Carbon.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.800
The demo's pretty awesome, actually.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.960
I'm pretty impressed with it so far.

07:04.960 --> 07:10.400
So may need to check that out once the game finally makes its way out here.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.980
And then, of course, I know there's some...I tried playing the multiplayer demo of Splinter

07:13.980 --> 07:19.400
Cell, Double Agent, but unfortunately, at the time, I was torrenting a bunch of stuff

07:19.400 --> 07:22.680
and Xbox Live didn't like that too much.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.520
So I'll have to try that next week.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.560
I think that's about all I played, yeah.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.960
All right.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.320
My gaming week, a lot of the old standbys.

07:33.320 --> 07:38.600
I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, a little more progress in Enchanted Arms.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.000
New stuff I checked out this week, though.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.960
I downloaded Dig Dug when it came out on Wednesday, because out of the old Namco classics that

07:46.960 --> 07:52.840
have been released recently, Pac-Man and Galaga, I would say Dig Dug's my favorite.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.920
It was just always my favorite a long time ago.

07:54.920 --> 07:59.280
I remember playing the game a hell of a lot on Commodore 64 and at a local pizza place

07:59.280 --> 08:03.980
when local pizza places had a lot of good arcade games.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.400
So it was cool.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.580
It was kind of a little bit of memories.

08:08.580 --> 08:12.480
I have to admit, though, I'm a little bit disappointed, as I'm sure most Xbox fans are

08:12.480 --> 08:16.280
feeling, is that it seems like we've just had nothing but a barrage over the past couple

08:16.280 --> 08:20.440
months of rehashed old classic games, and we're really looking forward to some of the

08:20.440 --> 08:27.000
new stuff, Lumines, Castle Crashers, all this other stuff that's supposed to be coming out.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.280
I believe I heard somewhere that Xbox has their stuff.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.960
I want to say when we did the story last week about Duke Nukem, the possibilities of that

08:34.960 --> 08:39.240
coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, they had said that Xbox Live has its calendar full through

08:39.240 --> 08:42.360
the end of the year, or something like that, and it's kind of like, why aren't we seeing

08:42.360 --> 08:46.040
releases every week, or why aren't we seeing more homegrown stuff?

08:46.040 --> 08:49.600
Why can't they release more than one game a week?

08:49.600 --> 08:50.600
Is that so difficult?

08:50.600 --> 08:51.600
I don't know.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
I mean, seriously.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
I don't know.

08:53.600 --> 08:59.520
But yeah, Dig Dug, yay, another classic game, not so yay, but for the value of $5, you can't

08:59.520 --> 09:00.520
really complain.

09:00.520 --> 09:06.960
It's got really easy achievements if you're into hoarding up the achievements, and unfortunately

09:06.960 --> 09:11.520
no multiplayer or any of that stuff, but it's Dig Dug.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.960
Either you remember it from your childhood and you love it, or you'll download the demo

09:14.960 --> 09:20.540
and think, oh, another 1980s game that I may or may not buy, depending on how much nostalgia

09:20.540 --> 09:22.580
means to me.

09:22.580 --> 09:26.320
Going from something very nostalgic to something very new, it's kind of nostalgic in a way.

09:26.320 --> 09:32.720
I also played Mortal Kombat Armageddon on PlayStation 2, which is the clusterfuck Mortal

09:32.720 --> 09:34.560
Kombat, so to speak.

09:34.560 --> 09:40.840
Every single character who was ever in a Mortal Kombat game, except for one obscure, you don't

09:40.840 --> 09:45.200
even remember this chick, but most every single character's in it.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.320
Did you try the Mario Kart type game?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
I did.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.520
The Motor Kombat, or whatever it's called?

09:50.520 --> 09:51.520
It's cheesy.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.620
I mean, don't expect...

09:53.620 --> 09:55.080
It's not a racing game.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.120
Mortal Kombat Armageddon was not designed to be a racing game.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.160
It's definitely something extra they tacked on.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.800
It's cute, it's fun, but it'll get old fast.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.760
The tracks are very simple in design.

10:05.760 --> 10:11.800
They're very, very simple, and each kart only really has one attack that it does, depending

10:11.800 --> 10:13.360
on which character you are.

10:13.360 --> 10:18.280
For instance, Johnny Cage will launch a green bomb onto the track in front of him so he

10:18.280 --> 10:19.760
can hit guys in front of you.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.720
Melina does a boost type thing.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.920
It's a very simple game.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.840
This is not a replacement for Mario Kart.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.720
It's just something extra to giggle at for a few minutes.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.400
The game itself is based off the engine of the previous games.

10:32.400 --> 10:38.480
Unfortunately, I do feel they had to dumb it down a little bit to fit all of the characters,

10:38.480 --> 10:41.440
just the massive characters they have in this game.

10:41.440 --> 10:46.760
Each character now only has one fighting style and a weapon, but you get a fair tradeoff

10:46.760 --> 10:50.840
because now you have the create a character mode, although essentially what I noticed

10:50.840 --> 10:55.880
in create a character mode is, costumes aside, pretty much everything else you're buying,

10:55.880 --> 10:58.680
you're just buying bits and pieces of what the other characters already have.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.540
But it's still kind of neat.

11:00.540 --> 11:04.600
Some folks like the Barbie mode in their fighting games, so it's kind of fun.

11:04.600 --> 11:09.640
I would say if you like the previous Mortal Kombat games, you're probably going to like

11:09.640 --> 11:16.620
this one too, but as far as entry level Mortal Kombat games go, as far as fighting, I actually

11:16.620 --> 11:19.040
think I kind of preferred the last one a little bit, but I don't know.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.600
Actually I haven't gotten to play this one in depth enough yet.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.520
I'll be honest, I didn't even get a chance to check out Conquest mode, which I wanted

11:24.520 --> 11:25.520
to.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
I heard it short though.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.000
But I really liked the last one, and it was pretty intricate with the fighting styles

11:30.000 --> 11:34.160
because you had combos that would chain from one style to another to the weapon.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.920
Well, the last one technically was Shell and Monks, so that wasn't really a Mortal Kombat

11:38.920 --> 11:39.920
game.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.920
No, not that one.

11:40.920 --> 11:41.920
The one before it.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.920
Deception.

11:42.920 --> 11:43.920
Deception, yeah.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.920
I actually think I kind of preferred that one.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.480
So what if it didn't have the big cluster of characters?

11:46.480 --> 11:51.000
I've had enough to keep the game fresh and moving.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.240
But if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, this is definitely fan service.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.000
I would say the other disappointing thing about this game is I'm kind of surprised it's

11:58.000 --> 11:59.960
not next gen.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.280
I think if they went next gen with it, then maybe they could have squeezed all that stuff

12:03.280 --> 12:04.280
into it.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.640
Of course, it probably would have been in development for another year, but I don't

12:06.640 --> 12:07.640
know.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.840
They're probably working on one.

12:08.840 --> 12:09.840
It's not bad.

12:09.840 --> 12:15.360
If we're fighting, considering the amount of variety you get with this game, it's actually

12:15.360 --> 12:16.360
pretty good.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.640
It's a fighting game itself.

12:18.640 --> 12:25.640
I feel a game like Soul Calibur II or III even is much more intricate in the fighting

12:25.640 --> 12:32.560
styles, whereas this is just variety, fan service, just throwing tons of different things

12:32.560 --> 12:33.560
at you.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.840
So take it as you will.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
And then that's about it.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.160
One other thing, but we'll get to that later.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.200
So I'll ask Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

12:43.200 --> 12:49.000
My gaming week was pretty good, shockingly, since I'm not only playing Final Fantasy XI

12:49.000 --> 12:50.240
anymore.

12:50.240 --> 12:56.280
This week I played a good amount of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Luminous Live on Xbox

12:56.280 --> 12:57.280
Live.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
Wait a minute.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.280
Wait a minute.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.600
How come the rest of us haven't gotten a chance to play that?

13:00.600 --> 13:03.520
Because you guys don't use Microsoft's network.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
Oh, I see.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.520
You're special.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.520
I'm special.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.520
Okay.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.240
And I had a great time with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.060
Luminous Live, not so much.

13:12.060 --> 13:17.120
The 360 controller really, really, really sucks for that game.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.880
I also picked up three new games this week.

13:21.880 --> 13:27.760
I picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and that's kind of boring, but it got me through

13:27.760 --> 13:32.400
the Wii pre-order line on Friday.

13:32.400 --> 13:37.160
I also picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner, and that's a really, really neat

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
game.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.560
I'm not too far in it.

13:39.560 --> 13:45.320
And I picked up Mortal Kombat Armageddon, and I think it's a decent game, but they screwed

13:45.320 --> 13:47.900
up Rain, and he was my favorite character.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.520
So I was not too happy about that.

13:51.520 --> 13:56.740
Other than that, haven't really played much else, I guess, except for what we'll be talking

13:56.740 --> 13:58.160
about later.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.920
So that's about it.

14:00.920 --> 14:06.600
Other questions in chat room, the always present extra guest on our show, orangelaunchradio.com,

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
click on chat.

14:07.600 --> 14:12.120
Jeremy Todd 1 asks, Miklotov, so you're saying the shitty 360 controller's D-pad works good

14:12.120 --> 14:14.220
for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3?

14:14.220 --> 14:19.280
Actually yeah, because you can perform the rolling moves, like down to forward and stuff

14:19.280 --> 14:22.000
like that, really easily.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.960
So yeah, I would say it works pretty well for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.760
How about the lag in the game, because I know that was something that was a bitch with Street

14:32.760 --> 14:37.680
Fighter 2, and I was just wondering if they fixed that kind of stuff.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.400
I didn't notice any lag, honestly.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.400
It was really nice.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.060
Yeah, but wouldn't it be harder to judge on your network, though, because that's like

14:44.060 --> 14:46.120
a different thing than the public thing?

14:46.120 --> 14:47.120
That's true.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.400
So I mean, it might be different on the public.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.600
I think we got some pretty bad lag, though, when we were playing Street Fighter before

14:51.600 --> 14:53.600
it came out, also.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.760
Interesting.

14:54.760 --> 14:59.080
There was another comment in chat room, Blaze said, Skye, the original Mortal Kombat never

14:59.080 --> 15:00.080
had the variety.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.080
It's a true throwback.

15:01.080 --> 15:05.320
Yeah, I guess, but you know, your expectation level of fighting games was different back

15:05.320 --> 15:06.320
then.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.920
But then again, come to think of it, that was kind of one of Mortal Kombat's weaknesses

15:08.920 --> 15:09.920
in the beginning.

15:09.920 --> 15:15.720
I mean, yeah, it had fatalities, but the first one, as great of a game as it is, it is a

15:15.720 --> 15:17.680
little clunky, especially on the Genesis.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.560
How would you like to create a fatality mode in that?

15:20.560 --> 15:23.120
Oh yeah, that was the other thing about the game that bothered me.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.600
You don't really create a fatality.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.840
You just kind of do these, when it goes finish him, you just start doing like, tor tor square,

15:28.840 --> 15:33.000
a way toward X, you just start doing all this random stuff, and they'll do all these types

15:33.000 --> 15:34.040
of random things.

15:34.040 --> 15:38.360
Some of them are kind of funny, like one fatality I watched Miklotov do, he ripped somebody's

15:38.360 --> 15:43.040
arms off and then knocked their face off with the arms, which is kind of funny, but the

15:43.040 --> 15:47.260
only problem with that is that once you've kind of gone through that, there actually

15:47.260 --> 15:49.760
isn't this level of variety that you'd think.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.840
I think it was a lot cooler when everybody kind of had their own unique thing they did,

15:53.840 --> 15:57.960
but I understand, again, 60-something characters, it's probably harder to do that, so that's

15:57.960 --> 15:59.320
why they had to go here.

15:59.320 --> 16:03.680
And like I was talking earlier to you about it, I don't think it's totally just that,

16:03.680 --> 16:08.800
it fits with the overall game's theme where everybody's just kind of rushing towards trying

16:08.800 --> 16:13.480
to get this power, and you know, it's not so much a tournament anymore as it's, let's

16:13.480 --> 16:17.340
just quickly kill as many people as we can so we can get farther than everybody else

16:17.340 --> 16:18.840
and get this power.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.400
I do like the fact that maybe the unlock's a lot easier in this game, you don't have

16:22.400 --> 16:27.480
the red, green, blue, grey coins, you just have coins, period, and then you know what

16:27.480 --> 16:30.960
you're unlocking before you do it, unlike the crypt where you had to open up a coffin

16:30.960 --> 16:35.160
and hope it had something good, unless you were cheating using GameFAQs, so anyway.

16:35.160 --> 16:41.320
Anyway, enough about my gaming week, let's get into some housekeeping news.

16:41.320 --> 16:46.240
There's actually not going to be a live show next week, we're going to pre-tape number

16:46.240 --> 16:50.480
205, that's because two of us are going to be out of town next Sunday, so there's not

16:50.480 --> 16:54.960
going to be a live show on Sunday, I believe we're going to pre-tape Wednesday night at

16:54.960 --> 17:00.040
this point, it's going to replace the usual guys on a show that you hear on the live station

17:00.040 --> 17:04.520
only here on Wednesday night, so we will be pre-taping live.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.620
There is, though, something I'm going to bring back that happened at Disneyland, or I should

17:08.620 --> 17:11.400
say didn't happen, no one found me.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.640
Well, it's a big place.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
Yeah.

17:13.640 --> 17:20.960
But I'm going to be at YowieCon this, next weekend, and I will be cosplaying as an Organization

17:20.960 --> 17:23.160
13 member, so you will see me.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.160
Nerd!

17:24.160 --> 17:25.760
Chris and Megsy are doing it, too.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.760
Nerds!

17:26.760 --> 17:28.600
I know, but we're cute nerds.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.440
So we are going to be in the big trench coats with stuff.

17:32.440 --> 17:38.500
If you find me, then you will get a CD sampler.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.080
Some CDs from a different drum.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.080
Yeah.

17:41.080 --> 17:47.560
Yeah, we have little three-inch singles, Rain Dancer with Come With Me and Rupesh Cartel,

17:47.560 --> 17:51.880
Death with Soft Names, but one of the B-sides on that single is Yours to Command, which

17:51.880 --> 17:57.600
is one of the new Ditter songs that we premiered earlier on in the DDR preview segment.

17:57.600 --> 18:04.720
So if you find me, if I'm not completely fawning over the Yowie action, then you get

18:04.720 --> 18:05.720
a present.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.520
I was going to say the man-gina.

18:07.520 --> 18:12.820
But I will also make this disclaimer, and I'm going to be singing Nightmare Before Christmas

18:12.820 --> 18:21.000
in 3-D at the Metreon on Friday night, and I will extend it there if somebody recognizes

18:21.000 --> 18:24.680
me, you get the CD.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.480
If not at YowieCon, then at the Metreon.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.640
I worry maybe I should give you some more, because there might be a lot of our listeners

18:29.640 --> 18:30.640
at YowieCon.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.640
I'll tell you what.

18:31.640 --> 18:32.640
First three people.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.640
How's that?

18:33.640 --> 18:34.640
We got a lot of these.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.640
We got a lot of these.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.640
So there you go.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.520
Two other ones for YowieCon, one is for Nightmare Before Christmas.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.440
There you go.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.440
Right there.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.440
Three pairs to give away.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.440
Have fun.

18:44.440 --> 18:51.600
All right, so go find Dark Sakura at YowieCon.

18:51.600 --> 18:56.160
I thought she already had one.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.160
That's all right.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.160
She wants to keep one for herself.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.160
I see how it is.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.160
That's fine.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.640
I actually forgot that I already had one, but oh well.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.640
That's all right.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.640
Have fun.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.720
Give those singles away.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.560
I will be traveling as well this weekend.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.520
This is the weekend where I'm finally going to New York City.

19:10.520 --> 19:14.960
Yes, I missed Digital Life by one whole week because I'm just cool like that.

19:14.960 --> 19:21.040
I will be in New York City this weekend, and I took some listeners' advice and scheduled

19:21.040 --> 19:23.840
a time to be at the Nintendo World Store.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.800
Now here's the thing.

19:25.800 --> 19:30.080
I haven't exactly cleared it with them or anything, and I'm not expecting a swarm of

19:30.080 --> 19:31.080
people.

19:31.080 --> 19:35.720
We don't exactly have that many people listening to the program, but I will be there Saturday

19:35.720 --> 19:38.640
at noon, so come look for me at the Nintendo World Store.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.640
You know what?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.920
I have friends, too, so they can come find me.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.760
So it's a West Coast-East Coast thing.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.120
You can come find Jamie on the West Coast, and you can come find me on the East Coast.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.120
So you can find some more.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
Exactly.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.360
So that will be Saturday at noon at the Nintendo World Store.

19:52.360 --> 19:53.360
I will be there.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.200
And Loki, you can find on his couch all weekend long.

19:55.200 --> 20:08.400
I'll be on my couch at my house, and I will have a CD in case you find me, just in case.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.360
Mikl Tov, will you be anywhere for the fans to meet?

20:10.360 --> 20:12.040
Actually, no one knows what you look like, anyway.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.040
Yeah, they don't.

20:13.040 --> 20:19.160
I'll be at work, probably, so if you find me at work, I'll give you a high-five, because

20:19.160 --> 20:20.160
I don't have CDs.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.160
All right.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.160
Sounds good.

20:22.160 --> 20:26.520
Actually, I should, because the picture on the form is sort of outdated.

20:26.520 --> 20:33.000
My hair is dyed red now with black streaks in the front, so it will probably be straight,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
not curly.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.200
Yeah, you look a little different than you do in the album art that you see on iTunes,

20:36.200 --> 20:38.680
like when you download, because that picture is like six months old.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.000
More than that.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.880
We did those pictures last winter.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.880
Wow.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.880
Long time.

20:43.880 --> 20:44.880
We need new ones.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.880
It's time for new pictures.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
New ones.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
All right.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.640
But if anyone looks at my DeviantArt account on my Deviant tag, that's what my hair looks

20:49.640 --> 20:50.640
like.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.680
All right.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.040
So come find us.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.600
New York City, Saturday, YALIcon, Metreon, all weekend long.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.960
Orange Orange Radio invades coast to coast.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.920
DDR previews a little bit later on in this segment.

21:03.920 --> 21:08.480
Two new songs from Ultramix 4 and two new songs from DDR Universe tonight.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.280
But first, some gaming news.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.280
Yes.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.280
Lots of gaming news.

21:12.280 --> 21:19.840
And of course, you know, like every year, we were looking forward to E3, keyword is

21:19.840 --> 21:20.840
were.

21:20.840 --> 21:28.320
Unfortunately, E3, as announced last, well, actually earlier this year, it's been downsized.

21:28.320 --> 21:34.240
So yeah, unfortunately we won't be able to see this wonderful giant expo with 60,000

21:34.240 --> 21:35.960
plus people in it.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.800
And well anyways, here's the details on what's going to be happening with this.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.880
It's now being called the E3 Media and Business Summit.

21:42.880 --> 21:50.720
It will take place between July 11th and the 13th in Santa Monica, California.

21:50.720 --> 21:56.880
And they're actually going to be taking up several hotels as well as the large Barker

21:56.880 --> 22:02.760
Hanger, which is going to be kind of a show floor type thing, I don't know.

22:02.760 --> 22:06.760
I guess a place that they can use to demonstrate stuff, basically.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.720
And it's going to be invite only.

22:08.720 --> 22:15.840
And basically, according to Doug Lowenstein, this is kind of how he's summing up the whole

22:15.840 --> 22:16.840
E3.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.820
E3 is not a place where product is sold anymore.

22:18.820 --> 22:24.240
The industry is recognized as a big part of mainstream culture.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.360
So the need for a big glittering event to validate the industry is not what it used

22:28.360 --> 22:29.700
to be.

22:29.700 --> 22:35.940
What is needed is to focus on the fact that E3 is going to be much more about media related

22:35.940 --> 22:37.400
opportunities.

22:37.400 --> 22:42.240
The question is, what is the most efficient way to create those opportunities?

22:42.240 --> 22:44.640
Here's my question to Doug Lowenstein there.

22:44.640 --> 22:52.320
When you say media, do you mean media or the people that have TV shows and giant multi

22:52.320 --> 22:58.680
million dollar websites because talking with some of the other publishers out there, that

22:58.680 --> 22:59.680
seems to be the case.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.360
They just kind of want to ignore the smaller guys.

23:02.360 --> 23:07.220
So just remember that the smaller guys do have a reach out there in the marketplace

23:07.220 --> 23:10.840
and do contact your customers.

23:10.840 --> 23:16.160
So take that in mind when you're picking those select thousands of people that are going

23:16.160 --> 23:19.380
to be at this event.

23:19.380 --> 23:23.560
So that whole thing where he says there's no need for E3 to be the glittering event

23:23.560 --> 23:28.300
it once was, he's basically saying, Paris Hilton, stay home.

23:28.300 --> 23:33.720
Keep your skanky ass at home with your dumb little dog and get the hell away from my show.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.960
To that I say, Amen.

23:36.960 --> 23:41.680
I understand because there are a lot of people there and it's hard to conduct business, but

23:41.680 --> 23:49.160
at the same time, it's good to have the publicity for your games, especially the smaller companies.

23:49.160 --> 23:54.240
They want people noticing their game there because then it gets covered and then the

23:54.240 --> 23:55.600
word spreads about it.

23:55.600 --> 24:01.780
I think that there are the major news sites out there, but the smaller guys also get the

24:01.780 --> 24:02.780
message out.

24:02.780 --> 24:05.960
When you're reading it on some of the smaller sites, it's like, wow, this information might

24:05.960 --> 24:07.880
be pretty big if it's being covered.

24:07.880 --> 24:12.160
The smaller sites don't tend to just copy and paste the press release.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.880
Not that I'm insinuating that the big boys do anything, but I overheard at a recent media

24:16.880 --> 24:19.880
event, big boys saying that's essentially what they did is they copied and pasted from

24:19.880 --> 24:21.280
the press release.

24:21.280 --> 24:24.260
So if that's what you want, why bother throwing a show?

24:24.260 --> 24:25.800
Just fucking email E3.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.480
Just put E3 in a zip file and send it to their email.

24:29.480 --> 24:34.520
Web conference, not in a conference room with those intercom things.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.520
I don't know.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.520
I'm just worried.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.600
Personally, I'm worried we're not going to be invited.

24:38.600 --> 24:43.440
That's my only worry and it would be very disappointing to me because I really do care

24:43.440 --> 24:48.760
about seeing these companies' product and helping promote that stuff.

24:48.760 --> 24:53.960
That's kind of why we go, but they don't think that just because...

24:53.960 --> 24:58.040
I like how certain TV shows out there, even though they don't cover gaming anymore, still

24:58.040 --> 25:03.520
get top listing on these new events.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.520
I don't know.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.400
I'm not trying to be focused on that.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.520
If they don't want coverage, then we'll cover something else that wants the coverage that

25:10.520 --> 25:12.640
I'm sure is a decent game, fine.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.680
But I think it's interesting that the whole thing is being held in Santa Monica because

25:15.680 --> 25:20.380
I think about, shit, we stayed in Santa Monica for the last E3 and had that horrible commute

25:20.380 --> 25:25.120
to downtown LA that made us late for those shows we were doing for Marina.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.960
That hotel we stayed at, the Best Western or whatever it was, probably going to be twice

25:28.960 --> 25:31.880
as expensive next year now that E3 is there.

25:31.880 --> 25:36.400
But I then think about, boy, Scott over at All Games and the folks at Arena Interactive

25:36.400 --> 25:37.400
Lounge where we broadcast...

25:37.400 --> 25:38.400
Snack dab in the middle of it.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.720
They're probably having a fucking field day at this news.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.440
They're probably so excited.

25:42.440 --> 25:47.200
But I also think, and I'm not insinuating anything, I don't know shit about what they're

25:47.200 --> 25:51.360
doing next year, but just knowing the type of guy that Scott is, he will try and get

25:51.360 --> 25:56.680
some of those indie developers that get shut out of the big show over at the Arena.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.000
My gut tells me based on some things I saw last year that probably I wouldn't put it

26:00.000 --> 26:05.960
past those guys to try and do some type of unofficial E3 satellite thingy there and it's

26:05.960 --> 26:07.720
going to be right in the heart of everything.

26:07.720 --> 26:11.360
And I say, fine, we'll cover that if we can't get into the big show.

26:11.360 --> 26:15.600
So I'm looking forward to it anyways.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.720
Outpost is where it's at next year.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.040
I miss my yearly playing of X-Tango.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.200
Yeah, poor X-Tango.

26:22.200 --> 26:26.920
Hey, yeah, Scott, if you're listening, get the X-Tango folks at Arena.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.400
Tell them to give me a copy.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.680
So we can ask them if their game's ever going to freaking come out.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.680
That'd be nice.

26:32.680 --> 26:37.480
It's going to be part of the brand new Duke Nukem Forever.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.480
Coming out on the Phantom.

26:40.480 --> 26:49.480
Anyway, speaking of games that we've been waiting for, the demo for Phantasy Star Universe

26:49.480 --> 26:53.520
on Xbox 360 is out.

26:53.520 --> 26:58.160
Today being Sunday for us, is the last day that you can download it.

26:58.160 --> 27:02.800
I think it was down midnight on Saturday.

27:02.800 --> 27:08.280
Well, whatever, by the time the people who download this show hear it, it's too late.

27:08.280 --> 27:13.680
Well, at any rate, I haven't played mine yet.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.560
I did download it yesterday, which is why I made my whole gamertag account and everything.

27:18.560 --> 27:24.840
But it will be up for play until Wednesday midnight, so that's the only time you're going

27:24.840 --> 27:25.840
to get to.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.520
Of course, it's already been in Japan forever, and I already know someone who has it on PC.

27:29.520 --> 27:34.560
But you know what's really pissy though about the Japanese release is that your CDs are

27:34.560 --> 27:42.600
all coded much like the US ones were for the GameCube and Dreamcast.

27:42.600 --> 27:47.120
But you also can only register online, and Sega got a whole crap load of complaints about

27:47.120 --> 27:52.520
that from people who don't have internet service or dial up.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.600
Or they just want to play the single player mode.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.160
They bought it just for single player, but you cannot play unless you register, even

27:58.160 --> 27:59.160
single player.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.160
Ouch.

28:00.160 --> 28:08.240
Well, as for the open beta, once the actual release is out, it will be $9.99 a month for

28:08.240 --> 28:09.640
our European listeners.

28:09.640 --> 28:13.920
That's 6.99 pounds.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.880
And they're saying that it will be available for your license, or they're calling it guardian

28:18.880 --> 28:25.960
license, will be available for purchase beginning the 24th of November on PC, PlayStation 2,

28:25.960 --> 28:26.960
and Xbox 360.

28:26.960 --> 28:31.680
Luckily, all the achievements are offline, so I can just rent this thing, which is excellent

28:31.680 --> 28:32.680
horror.

28:32.680 --> 28:39.120
And note the other best part about that beta demo is Tuesday that Xbox Live is going to

28:39.120 --> 28:43.200
be down the whole day, so you actually only get about two days to play that.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.200
Thank you, Sega.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.200
Yeah, that's true.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.440
Yeah, Xbox Live is going to be down Tuesday, so whoops, whoopsie daisy, forgot to plan

28:48.440 --> 28:49.440
for that.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.440
Oh well.

28:50.440 --> 28:57.560
At any rate, it's already out on PC in Japan, and that hasn't stopped people.

28:57.560 --> 29:01.920
My friend who's actually had this game now for about, I would say she's had about three

29:01.920 --> 29:06.320
weeks to a month, right?

29:06.320 --> 29:11.360
There is someone who is on one of the big Phantasy Star sites, again I'm not going to

29:11.360 --> 29:17.640
list names publicly, has made a loading tool for this to bypass the online registration.

29:17.640 --> 29:21.800
You cannot play it online, but you can play it in single player mode if you want to try

29:21.800 --> 29:24.120
out the PC version.

29:24.120 --> 29:28.800
Just look around, it's out there.

29:28.800 --> 29:33.800
I actually got to play the PSU demo, or beta, whatever you want to call it.

29:33.800 --> 29:39.180
The thing is though, it's kind of hard for me to base my judgment off of beta, because

29:39.180 --> 29:44.080
even though the full game is out in ten days, you did download something that's usually

29:44.080 --> 29:46.240
going to be on a DVD, whatever.

29:46.240 --> 29:51.320
But also the thing is that this thing is getting flooded with people that are just like, OMG

29:51.320 --> 29:52.920
free game.

29:52.920 --> 29:53.920
That's the problem.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.480
I can't wait for these people to be gone, and it's just the people who actually want

29:57.480 --> 30:02.040
to be playing and paid good money for Phantasy Star Universe, and then they'll stop bogging

30:02.040 --> 30:05.120
the servers, I think.

30:05.120 --> 30:11.440
As for the game itself, what I did get to play, the only problem I had with it is the

30:11.440 --> 30:15.720
tutorial was a little bit clunky and would freeze up, so it was easier to bypass it.

30:15.720 --> 30:19.520
If you bypass the tutorial, then you kind of don't know what you're doing in the game,

30:19.520 --> 30:23.200
because just enough has changed from Phantasy Star Online.

30:23.200 --> 30:27.640
Finally, once I figured it out and got in there, it was kind of fun, and I played with

30:27.640 --> 30:32.080
a stranger through one level, and it ran pretty well.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.560
I've got to say, some of the sceneries are really nice.

30:35.560 --> 30:40.600
If you figure out, for those that are playing the beta, go out to the fourth floor, go out

30:40.600 --> 30:45.020
the left side, and then you can transport to different planets, and you can transport

30:45.020 --> 30:53.240
to this greenish planet that has a very ancient China-looking city, and then if you go out

30:53.240 --> 30:57.200
in the world there, even though the mission is a level 15 mission, just kind of go into

30:57.200 --> 30:58.200
it and see what it looks like.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.200
It's really pretty.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.680
It looks like fall, and things are falling from the trees.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.440
It's nice-looking.

31:03.440 --> 31:09.680
I don't think it's OMG, next-gen, to-the-max nice-looking, but that makes sense, seeing

31:09.680 --> 31:13.880
as it was developed for PlayStation 2 as well, but it's nice.

31:13.880 --> 31:19.280
I probably will pick up the retail version, only because I know at least Miklotov will

31:19.280 --> 31:25.760
play with me, and probably DarkSakura and our buddy Kasumi as well will all be playing.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.640
So it'll be fun, because there will be people to play with.

31:28.640 --> 31:33.360
The one thing that I sort of hope is that since we've done this massive download, it

31:33.360 --> 31:38.160
would be nice, though, for the folks that actually have gone into the effort of downloading

31:38.160 --> 31:42.060
the game, that we could just play off the downloaded version, but maybe there could

31:42.060 --> 31:45.960
be a quick mode or something that they actually use the demo version for.

31:45.960 --> 31:46.960
Oh, I see.

31:46.960 --> 31:49.760
Well, they already said you're not going to be able to transfer your character you made

31:49.760 --> 31:51.000
in the beta over, so...

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
That's ridiculous.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah, well.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Miklotov, what do you think?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
You've spent a lot of time playing this.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.360
I really like it.

31:57.360 --> 32:02.700
I have a few really glaring issues with it, though.

32:02.700 --> 32:06.480
So I play as a force on Phantasy Star Online, because they're the best.

32:06.480 --> 32:11.720
And in this game, from what I can tell so far is that the only way I can do magic is

32:11.720 --> 32:13.080
if I equip it to a weapon.

32:13.080 --> 32:19.680
So I'm going to have to carry multiple weapons, or maybe, I don't know, I'm talking as loud

32:19.680 --> 32:23.000
as I can.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.080
I have to equip multiple weapons so I can have different magic spells, and that's going

32:27.080 --> 32:29.320
to really make me angry.

32:29.320 --> 32:36.480
And I like that Sega's crazy word filtering stuff still happens.

32:36.480 --> 32:41.240
Somebody had to use periods to cuss at me today, and it was pretty funny.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.040
Why were they cussing at you?

32:43.040 --> 32:45.640
Because they're like 12-year-olds that are playing Xbox Live.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.640
OMG free game.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.640
Yeah, exactly, like what you said earlier.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.960
Have you made voice chat in that?

32:50.960 --> 32:51.960
Voice chat?

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
I don't know.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.640
I didn't party, because I don't want to play with other people right now.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.960
I believe voice chat is only available once you get into a zone.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.240
It's not like in the lobby, like it was in the first game.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.360
I think it actually is.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.360
It's in party.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.360
Yeah.

33:05.360 --> 33:10.000
So one thing, though, that for anybody who is playing on Sega's website, they do have

33:10.000 --> 33:12.100
a feedback form.

33:12.100 --> 33:15.200
They want feedback from the beta, apparently.

33:15.200 --> 33:19.380
So make sure that if you see any glitches, anything weird, anything you don't like, make

33:19.380 --> 33:21.600
sure that you post about it on their page.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.120
Doesn't it seem like they're kind of a little close, though, with only 10 days to go?

33:24.120 --> 33:25.120
I mean, is this going to be another 8 days?

33:25.120 --> 33:29.680
If it's something that just requires a general tweak or a change in code, then...

33:29.680 --> 33:34.120
But the game's got to have already been shipped to retailers, essentially, waiting to go out.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.200
But I think it's talking about major glitches.

33:37.200 --> 33:42.920
Yeah, I know, but here we go again, another Xbox 360 game where they're patching it on

33:42.920 --> 33:44.320
the back end to fix all the bugs.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.320
You know, I'm just kind of like...

33:45.320 --> 33:47.920
That happens with any type of MMO.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.920
I guess.

33:48.920 --> 33:52.760
MMOs exist to be glitchy.

33:52.760 --> 33:57.200
I just hope it doesn't stay, you know, rappy Christmas for five years like the old Xbox

33:57.200 --> 33:58.200
one.

33:58.200 --> 34:04.400
You know, it sucks that it is glitchy, but we shouldn't expect MMOs to be glitchy.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.400
That's just fucking laziness in programming is what it is.

34:07.400 --> 34:12.040
I mean, you should be doing extensive beta testing on it, especially since the game came

34:12.040 --> 34:13.840
out already in Japan.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.760
You've already got, you know, some beta testing right there, you know, whatever you want to

34:17.760 --> 34:18.760
call it.

34:18.760 --> 34:23.200
But I think it's really ridiculous just to say, oh, yeah, this is a beta test, and hopefully

34:23.200 --> 34:26.120
everything goes well because we already done the game.

34:26.120 --> 34:30.160
So if we find a bug, yeah, that fucking sucks.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.160
Any other thoughts on PSU?

34:32.160 --> 34:35.840
The only other thing I don't like about it, and I know I'm being negative about it, but

34:35.840 --> 34:38.480
I do really like the game.

34:38.480 --> 34:43.880
At least in PSO, you all kind of look the same, like, you know, all the forces had dresses

34:43.880 --> 34:45.380
and such.

34:45.380 --> 34:55.020
But their creation in this game, while it's highly detailed, the costumes, each, like,

34:55.020 --> 35:00.140
the newmans and the humans for each gender, they all get the same costumes.

35:00.140 --> 35:04.560
So you see a lot of the same people running around.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.480
It's pretty terrible because, I mean, I don't want to see a whole bunch of people with just

35:08.480 --> 35:13.800
the black and red shirt on, and it doesn't seem like anybody's really, you know, their

35:13.800 --> 35:15.480
own character because of it.

35:15.480 --> 35:20.400
I do understand that the RBG slider has been removed to change color.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.400
Oh, really?

35:21.400 --> 35:22.960
I didn't know it was there in, like, the...

35:22.960 --> 35:23.960
It was in the old ones.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.680
You could change the colors of the outfits.

35:25.680 --> 35:28.960
Oh, no, it was...

35:28.960 --> 35:30.920
The hair and different tones.

35:30.920 --> 35:31.920
You can do it for some of it.

35:31.920 --> 35:35.320
Oh, you can still do the hairs and, like, the eyes and stuff, which is really cool because

35:35.320 --> 35:38.680
you can do eyes before, it's just depending on your face.

35:38.680 --> 35:44.920
But I mean, at least there were, like, different patterns on the different outfits you could

35:44.920 --> 35:50.960
pick in PSO, but now it's just palette swaps, and they look pretty terrible.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.680
You know, since Miklotov likes to play a force, essentially what he's saying is he misses

35:54.680 --> 35:57.600
being able to wear a dress in Phantasy Star Online.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.600
Yeah, actually, I kind of do it.

35:59.600 --> 36:03.080
It doesn't look like a force if I'm wearing shorts and a short-sleeve shirt.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.080
I'm sorry.

36:04.080 --> 36:09.240
Dude, the forces were great because the men had these evening gowns, and...

36:09.240 --> 36:13.760
Well, what I'm thinking is they probably removed some of the stuff for the beta.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.520
I mean, because it's, you know, they cut down the file size.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.640
I think it's actually like that on the PC version.

36:19.640 --> 36:23.840
I'll have to, I actually have to ask my friend who's been playing it.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.200
Oh, hopefully they'll release more later.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.200
I don't know.

36:27.200 --> 36:31.520
There's supposed to be downloadable patches later for extra outfits and things you can

36:31.520 --> 36:33.080
earn, stuff like that.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.080
All right.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.720
Well, we'll have a more full review of the actual game itself once it's released.

36:37.720 --> 36:40.640
I'm sure at least one of us, if not two or three of us, are going to pick that thing

36:40.640 --> 36:42.960
up, so we'll give you our full thoughts on the game a little later.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.400
In the meantime, if you haven't downloaded the beta yet, too bad.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.880
You're not going to get a chance.

36:47.880 --> 36:52.960
Moving on to another Xbox-related story, Microsoft is teaming up with Best Buy and the Boys and

36:52.960 --> 36:56.000
Girls Club of America to go on a 20-city bus tour.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
They're going to be educating parents on the ESRB rating scheme and how to implement parental

37:02.000 --> 37:05.320
controls on the Xbox 360 and the Xbox Live service.

37:05.320 --> 37:11.280
In other words, hopefully there'll be a tutorial on how to block asses on the Xbox 360 cams

37:11.280 --> 37:13.640
for parents.

37:13.640 --> 37:20.040
This is a nice, good service, feel-good community thing, but it certainly doesn't help in selling

37:20.040 --> 37:22.120
parents on Xbox 360s, does it?

37:22.120 --> 37:23.120
I'm sorry?

37:23.120 --> 37:26.120
I think it does.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.120
What do you mean?

37:27.120 --> 37:28.120
Oh, no, no.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.120
I'm being a little bit sarcastic.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.120
Oh, sorry.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.120
I'm stupid.

37:31.120 --> 37:35.560
I'm telling parents on the Xbox 360, like, look at what a great, family-friendly system

37:35.560 --> 37:36.560
we are.

37:36.560 --> 37:40.000
Nintendo, eat your heart out, you know, type thing, even though, you know, I'm again being

37:40.000 --> 37:43.720
sarcastic because obviously Nintendo and Sony both will have very similar things built in

37:43.720 --> 37:44.720
their systems.

37:44.720 --> 37:49.720
Anyway, the tour is going to be going around pretty much the top cities in the U.S. where

37:49.720 --> 37:56.200
the most people are, you know, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco,

37:56.200 --> 37:57.200
Seattle.

37:57.200 --> 38:01.600
If you want to check out the full schedule, you can always check out xbox.com slash is

38:01.600 --> 38:04.440
your family set.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.720
Is your family set, Loki?

38:06.720 --> 38:09.520
I would hope so because I don't have a family.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.840
I'm set, so, you know, whatever.

38:12.840 --> 38:18.120
I'm set and ready to see some Xbox cam boobies and cocks.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.880
Let's make sure you're 18 and over, please.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.160
I have the internet for boobs.

38:22.160 --> 38:26.200
Well, I haven't seen any of that stuff yet, but yeah, that'd be kind of fun.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.200
No, neither have I. I'm just kidding.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.200
I don't really want to see it.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.840
They should have a channel that's only that stuff.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.840
Like the underground?

38:31.840 --> 38:36.360
Like, yeah, something like the red light district or something.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.760
Yeah, you do get to classify yourself.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.480
It's called the green door.

38:39.480 --> 38:43.080
You get to classify yourself, you know, under Xbox, like, oh, you're recreational, you're

38:43.080 --> 38:45.040
pro or you're underground, right?

38:45.040 --> 38:46.560
They do need red light district.

38:46.560 --> 38:52.520
But I have never seen those categories actually dictate where you actually get placed.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.520
Oh, I have.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.520
Have you?

38:54.520 --> 38:59.040
Yeah, for ChromeHounds, actually, when you're inviting people, you can make it specific

38:59.040 --> 39:00.040
to certain...

39:00.040 --> 39:01.040
Oh, whatever.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.040
All right.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.040
Whatever.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.560
Well, it's pretty cool that they're, you know, kind of given some guidance to parents as

39:05.560 --> 39:09.160
far as, you know, helping their kids with games and stuff.

39:09.160 --> 39:13.160
Although some people, though, should have been receiving better guidance when they dropped

39:13.160 --> 39:17.160
out of high school to play professional video games.

39:17.160 --> 39:23.280
One such person, Tom Taylor, T-squared for short, is actually some 20-something year

39:23.280 --> 39:32.520
old professional gamer who has landed a $250,000 gaming contract in addition to running his

39:32.520 --> 39:35.880
brand new video game tutoring company.

39:35.880 --> 39:43.640
And basically the Associated Press spoke with him about his, you know, earning six figures.

39:43.640 --> 39:48.600
And basically his response to the whole thing was, he takes risks.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.600
I take risks.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.320
In order to get paid, you have to take risks.

39:52.320 --> 39:57.560
I think I took the biggest risk I could take dropping out of school to play video games

39:57.560 --> 39:58.800
and it paid off.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.620
I guess some people are just born with talent in certain things like Michael Jordan was

40:02.620 --> 40:04.200
born to play basketball.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.040
I feel I was born to play video games.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.700
Yeah, that's a really great role model.

40:10.700 --> 40:14.680
Drop out of school so you can play video games professionally.

40:14.680 --> 40:20.100
I don't want to see this guy be, yeah, I suggest all the gaming companies out there pick up

40:20.100 --> 40:21.640
this guy as your spokesperson.

40:21.640 --> 40:22.640
That's perfect.

40:22.640 --> 40:26.420
That is the, you know, perfect role model you want for your customers.

40:26.420 --> 40:30.840
Drop out of school because, you know what, you could buy some games on a minimum wage

40:30.840 --> 40:31.840
job.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.840
It's fine.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.080
I want them to hire me.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.880
I finished school.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.880
I'm an educated gamer.

40:38.880 --> 40:44.120
I want to tear into this guy but I can't help but think that would be a little bit hypocritical

40:44.120 --> 40:51.720
when I think back to college and all the class I missed due to Final Fantasy VII.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.720
But you know.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.080
I used to skip class to watch Sailor Moon.

40:55.080 --> 40:59.200
I think there's nothing wrong in the fact that, you know, playing video games for a

40:59.200 --> 41:03.080
college, I mean granted that's pretty risky, I mean because, and let's not even get into

41:03.080 --> 41:07.000
how ridiculous it is to pay people to play video games professionally, I mean that is

41:07.000 --> 41:09.240
just ridiculous right there.

41:09.240 --> 41:12.800
And I agree it's ridiculous with professional sports and all that stuff too, but whatever,

41:12.800 --> 41:13.800
okay.

41:13.800 --> 41:19.520
I don't say video games, video games is definitely not a sport, let me put it that way.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.520
Just like curling.

41:20.520 --> 41:24.040
I think there's a difference too between high school drop out and college drop out.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.240
College drop out, that's fine.

41:25.240 --> 41:29.140
In this society there's an expectation, you know, well certainly, I mean again I guess

41:29.140 --> 41:33.580
it depends on which part of the country you're in, but you know, there's a real pressure

41:33.580 --> 41:38.440
out there to really, you've got to graduate high school if you want to move up in the

41:38.440 --> 41:39.440
corporate world.

41:39.440 --> 41:43.800
I mean granted there are jobs available and I don't know, because it's like there's exceptions

41:43.800 --> 41:47.960
to every world, but I just feel like, you know, if you're going to drop out of high

41:47.960 --> 41:51.800
school for a family situation, that's one thing, but you're going to drop out of high

41:51.800 --> 41:56.280
school to play video games, I don't know.

41:56.280 --> 42:01.120
And you know, from what I hear too, his team isn't that great.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.840
So I mean, I don't know.

42:03.840 --> 42:06.880
Interesting comments in our chat room though over at orangelawntrader.com, click on chat.

42:06.880 --> 42:10.620
Black Boy says, wait, how many pop stars never went to college?

42:10.620 --> 42:11.960
Or maybe pop stars dropped out of high school.

42:11.960 --> 42:15.180
I have no problem with people not going to college, because you know what, personally

42:15.180 --> 42:19.280
I didn't go to college and I don't think I really missed anything, because there aren't

42:19.280 --> 42:22.800
actually a lot of people that will start up, you know, their own businesses and stuff and

42:22.800 --> 42:24.840
they're very successful without going to college.

42:24.840 --> 42:29.600
I mean, granted, colleges help with certain jobs and stuff like that, but it's not necessary

42:29.600 --> 42:32.680
if you've already got the smarts to kind of do it, you can pretty much, you know, start

42:32.680 --> 42:34.440
up a company and be successful without it.

42:34.440 --> 42:38.700
I dropped out of college, I'm not exactly proud of it, but at the time it's what I had

42:38.700 --> 42:40.200
to do and I don't regret it.

42:40.200 --> 42:46.440
I've actually been in college off and on now for about 10 years.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.460
But see though, high school is important.

42:48.460 --> 42:52.800
I think you should be finishing high school, I mean, because, or at least test out of it.

42:52.800 --> 42:53.800
Yeah, exactly.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.120
You should be doing better education in high school though.

42:56.120 --> 43:02.000
Or, okay, I mean, I don't know, I just have a really big problem with someone like this

43:02.000 --> 43:07.400
being kind of a sponsor, because all we need this guy is to actually start playing good

43:07.400 --> 43:13.500
and winning stuff and then have him doing reviews on games and stuff, yeah, I got really

43:13.500 --> 43:16.960
good by not going to high school, yeah, that's excellent.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.680
In other words, kids, be cool, stay in school.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.680
Exactly.

43:20.680 --> 43:24.680
Any other comments from our chat room here, Funny Dale says, this guy is going to be working

43:24.680 --> 43:28.520
at Burger King in five years cleaning out the fat fryer.

43:28.520 --> 43:32.800
Hit Stun says, I can see him getting a right thumb injury and being out for a season and

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
going broke.

43:33.800 --> 43:41.280
So, that's true, what do you have to fall back on if you get carpal tunnel?

43:41.280 --> 43:42.280
You're screwed young man.

43:42.280 --> 43:46.040
I have to have that Atari controller that used your eyebrows.

43:46.040 --> 43:50.840
Or hopefully in the future we'll be controlling games with our brains.

43:50.840 --> 43:57.080
Well, speaking of brains and certain people who remain unnamed on this radio show, not

43:57.080 --> 44:04.220
using them, sorry, well, we've all been paying attention to the fact that Bully was pulled

44:04.220 --> 44:08.760
into court for being, you know, violent game, oh my God.

44:08.760 --> 44:11.840
I have a new name for said dummy.

44:11.840 --> 44:14.640
How about Crack Frompson?

44:14.640 --> 44:19.240
I still like Jackie Poo or Jackass.

44:19.240 --> 44:27.800
At any rate, the verdict that went down though with the ruling is basically the judge is

44:27.800 --> 44:31.080
not going to prohibit the sale of Bully.

44:31.080 --> 44:34.520
To quote, in the time that he played the game, the judge said he did not see anything so

44:34.520 --> 44:38.640
violent that would require the game to be held from being shipped.

44:38.640 --> 44:42.920
The judge and Take-Two employee used a cheat code in order to skip around in the game.

44:42.920 --> 44:48.640
From what I understand, I think they played through the game for at least two hours, and

44:48.640 --> 44:51.120
that's plenty of time to get a good feel for the game.

44:51.120 --> 44:57.800
They're also saying that there wasn't anything different than what was seen on TV really.

44:57.800 --> 45:02.640
OMG, there's cheat codes to skip around in the game, excellent.

45:02.640 --> 45:08.600
But if anyone's curious about how everybody's not friend, the real bully of the industry

45:08.600 --> 45:13.000
reacted, he was told to sit down.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.240
Wasn't there like outbursts in the courtroom in that whole thing?

45:16.240 --> 45:18.240
Oh, I would have loved to have been there.

45:18.240 --> 45:24.640
The thing is that he had no business being there because you cannot work, I think, as

45:24.640 --> 45:28.960
legal advisor for something that you have an interest in.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.320
He did mention though that he hoped that people got injured after playing this game so he

45:32.320 --> 45:33.520
could go, I told you so.

45:33.520 --> 45:37.960
Didn't he like sneak a slingshot into the courtroom to make some type of point about

45:37.960 --> 45:39.680
this is what people are going to do?

45:39.680 --> 45:44.280
Okay, okay, I know we're not really supposed to talk about it.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.840
What about Simpsons?

45:45.840 --> 45:50.480
Bart has a slingshot, I don't see slingshot-related deaths in the news.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.720
He's an idiot, plain and simple.

45:52.720 --> 45:59.640
The man has no comp, you can be educated and still be stupid, and this man is living proof.

45:59.640 --> 46:00.920
I cannot wait.

46:00.920 --> 46:05.400
And actually the thing about him being involved in this case is actually, from what I understand,

46:05.400 --> 46:08.800
precedent to have him disbarred in that state, so let's hope it happens.

46:08.800 --> 46:12.100
Raven's Dolphin says, Dennis the Menace has a slingshot.

46:12.100 --> 46:15.400
Go back to like 50s homely- 40s, I think.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.400
Was it?

46:16.400 --> 46:17.400
40s, yeah.

46:17.400 --> 46:21.780
I know, they were on Nickelodeon when I was a kid, so.

46:21.780 --> 46:28.320
It's human nature, I'm trying to remember which philosopher said this, but the nature

46:28.320 --> 46:32.680
of man is nasty, brutish, and short.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.560
People are prone to violence, it's written into our freaking DNA.

46:36.560 --> 46:40.760
No one talks about the dangers of cup stacking, either.

46:40.760 --> 46:44.600
Really Jack Thompson should- oh, I said it.

46:44.600 --> 46:48.280
Now I gotta go kill myself, that's alright.

46:48.280 --> 46:53.960
Him should actually go after them, because cup stacking is very dangerous, I think.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.920
Someone could put in an eye with that stuff.

46:55.920 --> 46:59.560
Why can't he just go back to attacking the music industry, please?

46:59.560 --> 47:03.880
My whole thing is, if they had pulled this game from Wal-Mart, or whatever, he got the

47:03.880 --> 47:11.080
result he wanted, doesn't that set the precedent that Wal-Mart ought to be pulling copies of

47:11.080 --> 47:17.960
Kill Bill off the shelves, and Pulp Fiction, and other violent train spotting, and other

47:17.960 --> 47:19.400
really violent movies?

47:19.400 --> 47:21.960
It's a double standard.

47:21.960 --> 47:24.240
Of course, maybe Jack Thompson would like that, I don't know.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.820
I said it too, spank, spank, spank.

47:26.820 --> 47:30.280
Maybe they should change it to Bible Mart.

47:30.280 --> 47:34.160
It's still a very nasty double standard that we're seeing in the overall entertainment

47:34.160 --> 47:35.720
industry.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.560
Right now, video games is the current scapegoat.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.560
That's how it is.

47:39.560 --> 47:47.960
It was music in the 80s and early 90s, it's evolved on to- back in the days, it was, you

47:47.960 --> 47:52.160
know, we can't watch this TV show because it's so risque, and they attack in the morning-

47:52.160 --> 47:55.560
Oh my god, Mr. and Mrs. Brady share a bed, who knew?

47:55.560 --> 48:00.400
Oh my god, Elvis and his hip thrusting, who knew?

48:00.400 --> 48:05.440
Or people would go on, what was that example, on the Ed Sullivan Show and ask them to change

48:05.440 --> 48:06.440
lyrics.

48:06.440 --> 48:08.840
Women are going to look at that and get impregnated immediately.

48:08.840 --> 48:16.920
Or even now with the whole not having available women's health care because we're going to

48:16.920 --> 48:20.680
decide to take over the world and fuck everybody, I don't know.

48:20.680 --> 48:25.680
Flaming Bozo in our chat room says, why doesn't he go to porn, why doesn't he fight porn?

48:25.680 --> 48:29.160
But at the same time, they don't sell porn at Wal-Mart, although I, well, I don't know.

48:29.160 --> 48:30.960
Everybody knows Jackie Pooh shops at Wal-Mart.

48:30.960 --> 48:34.520
I'm sure they sell Skinamax type movies there, but anyway.

48:34.520 --> 48:41.040
We all know that the whole reason he's so retentive is just that he's just not getting

48:41.040 --> 48:42.040
laid.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.040
Wow.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.040
That's it.

48:44.040 --> 48:48.120
All right, well, you know- There's no one would.

48:48.120 --> 48:55.040
Things about our dear friend, Mr. Frompson, get us a little bit angry.

48:55.040 --> 48:58.520
I don't know about you, Dark Sakura, but I just, I get so frustrated whenever I read

48:58.520 --> 49:03.640
about what this clown's up to next, and it makes me just want to rant a little bit.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.440
Doesn't it make you want to rant a little bit?

49:05.440 --> 49:06.440
A little.

49:06.440 --> 49:10.480
So I think it's time to bring on the trumpets and the symphonies that declare it be the

49:10.480 --> 49:22.800
FUs of the week.

49:22.800 --> 49:30.240
My FU of the week goes towards the stupid evil sinus infection from hell.

49:30.240 --> 49:36.240
For anyone who wasn't listening last year, I was sick for about two months with a weird

49:36.240 --> 49:43.400
combination of bronchitis and pneumonia, because, um, as the sinus infection, um, well, I have

49:43.400 --> 49:47.280
a sinus infection again, and it's starting off exactly the same way that my last one

49:47.280 --> 49:52.080
did, so now they're pumping me full of antibiotics and all kinds of anti-allergy drugs and all

49:52.080 --> 49:53.080
kinds of crap.

49:53.080 --> 49:59.080
It makes me feel absolutely loony and also lose my voice, like, I wake up in the morning

49:59.080 --> 50:00.080
and have no voice.

50:00.080 --> 50:01.080
It's crazy.

50:01.080 --> 50:04.440
And I love to talk, I guess, and so, you know, I'm on a radio show and all that.

50:04.440 --> 50:07.160
And I'm not always sick.

50:07.160 --> 50:15.600
FU to Fireboma, too, but, um, FU to the sinus infection, and also, the advice nurse was

50:15.600 --> 50:21.320
so funny, she's like, now, you've got chronic fatigue syndrome, it says here on your things,

50:21.320 --> 50:23.240
you're gonna get really tired.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.520
No shit, lady!

50:27.520 --> 50:33.360
But to, to, to their credit, the Kaiser folks were really nice to me and gave me my choice

50:33.360 --> 50:38.800
of antibiotics, so, yeah, I hate it.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.160
You sound like I've been drinking whiskey all night.

50:41.160 --> 50:46.040
I always thought that chronic fatigue syndrome was an inclination to wearing camo, but, you

50:46.040 --> 50:47.200
know, I guess I'm wrong.

50:47.200 --> 50:52.440
No, chronic fatigue syndrome is wearing camo and, you know, smoking the chronic.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.440
Gotcha.

50:53.440 --> 51:00.560
Anyways, um, FU to the India casino that we went to last night, because, um, you know,

51:00.560 --> 51:04.800
I think most Indian, actually, this Indian casino seems to be the worst one, it's Thunder

51:04.800 --> 51:10.800
Valley over here, um, I believe it's in Rockland or something, whatever, in California, and,

51:10.800 --> 51:17.800
um, basically, they want to rape you for your money, kind of like, um, yeah, like America

51:17.800 --> 51:19.720
did to the Indians way back when.

51:19.720 --> 51:24.440
But, um, anyways, um, I did leave there, though, only losing 50 cents, so that, that's really

51:24.440 --> 51:25.440
good.

51:25.440 --> 51:32.960
Oh, and, by the way, for Rob, FU, the fact that they do not have coconut shrimp.

51:32.960 --> 51:39.200
Um, my FU of the week goes to commuting.

51:39.200 --> 51:41.920
I'm giving the FU to driving this week, who would have thought?

51:41.920 --> 51:47.160
No, my FU goes to commuting and long commutes, and they make me frumpy and sad.

51:47.160 --> 51:48.160
That's it.

51:48.160 --> 51:57.320
My FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making a crappy Xbox A60 controller and ruining a

51:57.320 --> 52:04.000
brilliant game like Lumines, because you guys can't make a D-pad.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.600
And that's going to do it for, uh, this week's dose of Angst.

52:06.600 --> 52:10.720
At least it's better than the PSP D-pad.

52:10.720 --> 52:15.680
I like the PSP's D-pad, it's just the analog stick, they're the nub, the nipple, that bugs

52:15.680 --> 52:16.680
me.

52:16.680 --> 52:20.760
When I play Lumines on PSP, I have to use the analog stick on the 360, and I'll tell

52:20.760 --> 52:23.560
you, that's not really fun at all.

52:23.560 --> 52:30.500
All right, well, speaking of Sony controllers, there's a new one coming out for the PlayStation

52:30.500 --> 52:34.600
3, which was shown at Digital Life, which happened in New York City this weekend.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.600
I'm sure some of our listeners, I know some of them were there, I'm sure we'll get some

52:37.600 --> 52:41.980
calls in the Skyline a little later from the show from our folks who are at Digital Life.

52:41.980 --> 52:46.640
But there were some awards handed out at Digital Life, and I'm, I'm assuming this was Digital

52:46.640 --> 52:51.960
Life and Ziff Davis that handed out these awards, have no idea how they picked them,

52:51.960 --> 52:56.360
but the reason why I say PlayStation 3 is that Sony PlayStation 3 won the award for

52:56.360 --> 52:58.100
Best of Show.

52:58.100 --> 53:00.760
So it seems like things might be on a little bit of a turnaround.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.360
Even better people own some heavy narcotics.

53:03.360 --> 53:09.480
Or somebody's on some payroll, I don't know, but Ziff Davis, they don't have a PlayStation

53:09.480 --> 53:10.480
magazine, do they?

53:10.480 --> 53:11.480
Oh, wait, they do!

53:11.480 --> 53:15.880
Okay, but to be fair, they have one for Xbox 360 as well, right?

53:15.880 --> 53:17.600
No, they have computer and video games.

53:17.600 --> 53:18.600
Whatever.

53:18.600 --> 53:19.600
I don't give a shit, okay?

53:19.600 --> 53:24.800
The point is, is that, you know, they got this award or whatever, so it seems like in

53:24.800 --> 53:29.880
some folks' mind, maybe things are coming around for Sony, and maybe now Sony is starting

53:29.880 --> 53:32.680
to put out the, it's hard for me to say.

53:32.680 --> 53:36.680
I didn't play PlayStation 3 at Digital Life, I'm going to be relying on the listeners who

53:36.680 --> 53:41.820
call in later in the show to tell us how, if the PlayStation 3 at Digital Life was deserving

53:41.820 --> 53:42.820
of this award.

53:42.820 --> 53:44.420
I can just see it now.

53:44.420 --> 53:46.360
You know why the PlayStation 3 is awesome?

53:46.360 --> 53:50.440
Because it smells like money!

53:50.440 --> 53:51.820
Somehow I doubt that's it.

53:51.820 --> 53:54.360
What if they had really good games on display there?

53:54.360 --> 53:56.400
Loki, you don't know, you weren't there.

53:56.400 --> 54:00.640
Yeah, but I saw the list of games, and probably not.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.600
Whatever, you know, hey, great.

54:02.600 --> 54:07.680
Someone wants to spend $600 for the system, more power to you, go pre-order it at EB.

54:07.680 --> 54:10.160
Oh, wait, can't do that.

54:10.160 --> 54:15.440
SSJ100Matt says, Sky, they gave out Japanese horrors and HDTVs.

54:15.440 --> 54:20.740
DJKipplesandbit says, I went to Digital Life, I have no idea how the PS3 won during that

54:20.740 --> 54:21.740
show.

54:21.740 --> 54:31.560
Let's see, Jaded2006 says, just keep thinking that Sony is going to make a turnaround.

54:31.560 --> 54:32.560
Very interesting.

54:32.560 --> 54:38.440
Also, some other awards won at the show, Gaming Hardware, PlayStation 3.

54:38.440 --> 54:42.600
Gaming Software, Final Fantasy XII.

54:42.600 --> 54:47.240
For those of you that have to shop for kids this holiday season, the best gift for kids

54:47.240 --> 54:49.320
was the Fisher-Price SparkArt Easel.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.680
Is that like a Light Bright?

54:50.680 --> 54:51.680
I don't know.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.140
I'm Miss Light Bright.

54:53.140 --> 54:59.240
Best booth also went to Sony, but the hippest booth went to Napster.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.240
Remember them?

55:00.240 --> 55:01.240
Remember Napster?

55:01.240 --> 55:02.240
They're still around.

55:02.240 --> 55:03.240
Hey kids, remember Napster?

55:03.240 --> 55:07.540
There had to have been recreational pharmaceuticals involved in that show.

55:07.540 --> 55:09.680
I can neither confirm nor deny those statements again.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.320
We'll hear from the listeners a little later in the show.

55:11.320 --> 55:17.000
I'm sure they're already trying to hammer the Skype line to get in, so we'll see.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.280
And SSJ100Matt is putting out a call.

55:19.280 --> 55:21.280
Where's our listener, GrayWolf?

55:21.280 --> 55:26.480
He's the guy in the forums that's unapologetic in his Sony Phantom, wishing he was here right

55:26.480 --> 55:27.480
now.

55:27.480 --> 55:28.480
Who apparently writes in poetic prose form.

55:28.480 --> 55:29.640
Hey, they're fun to read.

55:29.640 --> 55:30.760
You know what?

55:30.760 --> 55:34.280
I encourage the opposing viewpoint to the masses.

55:34.280 --> 55:37.960
I encourage the opposing viewpoint as long as it's educated.

55:37.960 --> 55:43.360
And I'm all for a little bit of friendly debate as long as it doesn't resort to name calling.

55:43.360 --> 55:50.600
Well, Sony is apparently pretty happy after this week's pre-order fest at GameStop and

55:50.600 --> 55:51.600
EB.

55:51.600 --> 55:56.640
Of course, in case you didn't hear, they sold out of all the systems that the stores

55:56.640 --> 55:57.640
got.

55:57.640 --> 56:00.760
Well, it's not hard to sell out when you're only reserving eight systems at a store.

56:00.760 --> 56:06.520
I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, now now eight was, you know, a larger number.

56:06.520 --> 56:08.240
Some stores only got like four, I think.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.680
Some had sixteen, to be fair.

56:09.680 --> 56:10.680
But, still.

56:10.680 --> 56:11.680
Eight to sixteen, whatever.

56:11.680 --> 56:15.840
Anyway, so that's somewhere between twenty, oh, almost about twenty-eight thousand to

56:15.840 --> 56:18.080
about fifty-eight thousand systems.

56:18.080 --> 56:19.880
It's not bad.

56:19.880 --> 56:25.080
Basically, according to the Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson, Dave

56:25.080 --> 56:26.080
Cracker.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.760
Yeah, that's Cracker, all right.

56:28.760 --> 56:29.760
His name's Cracker?

56:29.760 --> 56:32.560
Well, Cracker or Craker or whatever.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.720
Listen up, Cracker!

56:34.720 --> 56:35.720
Anyways.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.680
Sorry, I had to be said.

56:37.680 --> 56:40.440
It was within minutes because, you know, obviously they sold out.

56:40.440 --> 56:43.120
Oh, yeah, because you had the line going, so.

56:43.120 --> 56:48.680
It reconfirms the excitement and anticipation that we've known since the very first discussion

56:48.680 --> 56:50.200
of PlayStation 3.

56:50.200 --> 56:54.780
We're just pleased to see that the reaction from the consumer is as strong as we anticipated

56:54.780 --> 56:55.860
it would be.

56:55.860 --> 56:59.200
It helps validate everything that we've been seeing up to this point.

56:59.200 --> 57:03.240
So if I released a system with only one unit in the United States, it'd be like, we sold

57:03.240 --> 57:06.960
everything in one second.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.040
It's awesome.

57:08.040 --> 57:14.600
My rebuttal to Sony is, everyone just go read VG Cats, look at the last comic, it perfectly

57:14.600 --> 57:15.880
illustrates it.

57:15.880 --> 57:20.160
And you know what, I'm sure we'll be covering this a little bit later on, but I don't think

57:20.160 --> 57:23.280
a lot of those people were keeping those systems.

57:23.280 --> 57:28.400
It's more like, hey, you know what, the Xbox 360 was being able to be sold for twice retail

57:28.400 --> 57:29.400
on eBay.

57:29.400 --> 57:30.400
Hmm.

57:30.400 --> 57:34.200
I'll tell you what, because I've got a PlayStation 3 pre-ordered.

57:34.200 --> 57:35.840
I know, traitor.

57:35.840 --> 57:36.840
My husband ordered.

57:36.840 --> 57:38.440
No, you're just a gaming whore.

57:38.440 --> 57:42.200
No, he ordered one and didn't pre-order a Wii and I'm pissed off at him.

57:42.200 --> 57:44.000
Yeah, F you.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Anyway.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.840
But the thing is, is that, you know, like if we decide that we hate it, which I probably

57:49.840 --> 57:53.720
will, except I want to play White Nights, but I could just autograph it and put it on

57:53.720 --> 57:58.760
eBay for a million, then, you know, I'd pay for the rest of my college and set up my own

57:58.760 --> 58:00.840
business and that type of thing.

58:00.840 --> 58:01.840
I guess.

58:01.840 --> 58:02.840
I don't know.

58:02.840 --> 58:04.320
The Dark Soccer Autographed Edition PS3.

58:04.320 --> 58:11.200
Well, also, I mean, of course, the Wii did also sell out as well at GameStop and EB,

58:11.200 --> 58:16.560
and I believe each store is getting at least 32, well, they're getting upwards to 32 systems,

58:16.560 --> 58:20.960
so about, I think it ended up being about twice what they were getting with the PlayStation

58:20.960 --> 58:21.960
3.

58:21.960 --> 58:25.360
I think the pro Sony side of this a little bit, you know, there are, I would believe

58:25.360 --> 58:30.680
there are 50,000 people in this country that excited about the PlayStation 3.

58:30.680 --> 58:34.760
I mean, for tech junkies, it is a Blu-ray player.

58:34.760 --> 58:35.760
It's pretty cheap.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.520
That's pretty exciting.

58:37.520 --> 58:40.080
Maybe there's, you know, I would believe that there's that many fanboys.

58:40.080 --> 58:44.480
I don't think there's any, it's just, you know, it's hard to go, ooh, it's just, it's

58:44.480 --> 58:50.800
this ravaging success when you consider there's really only eight PlayStation 3s at the store

58:50.800 --> 58:52.240
to be preserved, I don't know.

58:52.240 --> 58:56.240
We'll see a little more towards November 17th, but then again, like I've always been saying,

58:56.240 --> 58:59.000
is launch really that important?

58:59.000 --> 59:02.680
PlayStation 2 didn't wow me at launch, but it really won me over about a year later.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.080
Well, I don't know.

59:04.080 --> 59:07.240
Maybe by a year later, they will have actual systems in the stores.

59:07.240 --> 59:08.240
All right.

59:08.240 --> 59:10.800
I want to ask, let me go talk really quick while he's still here, because he's going

59:10.800 --> 59:11.800
to be leaving in a little bit.

59:11.800 --> 59:15.360
I wanted to ask you, you actually camped out for the Wii pre-order, right?

59:15.360 --> 59:16.360
I totally did.

59:16.360 --> 59:17.360
Tell us about that experience.

59:17.360 --> 59:18.360
How did that go?

59:18.360 --> 59:19.360
What time did you get there?

59:19.360 --> 59:20.360
Who else was there?

59:20.360 --> 59:23.740
My roommate decided we were going to go do the Wii pre-order, because we really, really

59:23.740 --> 59:25.120
want that system after playing it.

59:25.120 --> 59:28.920
Because unlike some folks, I actually have to report to work at eight o'clock in the

59:28.920 --> 59:29.920
morning.

59:29.920 --> 59:30.920
Yeah, whatever.

59:30.920 --> 59:33.280
I can go whenever I want.

59:33.280 --> 59:41.960
And so we got up about 3.45 AM to go to our local GameStop, and he went a little bit earlier

59:41.960 --> 59:47.600
than I did, but I arrived about a little past five, and there were already 16 people ahead

59:47.600 --> 59:54.920
of me, which was insane to me, because I didn't think people were as stupid as I am.

59:54.920 --> 59:56.920
Then again, this is the Bay Area.

59:56.920 --> 59:57.920
This is Tech Home.

59:57.920 --> 59:58.920
Yeah, that's true.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:05.520
But I live in the sunset, which is dead, so it was still shocking to me.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:11.520
And then more people started showing up, and around, I would say about maybe six, we had

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.840
a good 30 people in line to help pass the time.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.840
I played clubhouse games, which is OK.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.520
And then I'd say about 9.30, we had a little over 70 people in line.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.740
What's great about that is that the store opens at 10.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:31.920
So at about 9.30, 9.40, an employee came out, and those people who had been there since,

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.440
I would say about seven or eight, the people that were towards the back, they got told

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.000
that they would not be pre-ordering any systems today, because they only got 32 in.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.040
So I thought it was kind of jerky that the employees waited that long to come out and

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.440
tell the people in the back of the line that they weren't going to get anything.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.960
To their credit, though, corporate probably didn't tell them until then.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.560
They probably didn't get an email until overnight or something.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.600
That's not true.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600
That's not true.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600
Yeah.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600
They knew a few days in advance.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.600
Yeah.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.600
I knew about them.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.600
Poopy!

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.600
They're just jerks.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.080
But anyway, so they let us in two at a time to pre-order our systems, and I mean, it went

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080
pretty smooth.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.040
We got a list of stuff we could pre-order with the system while we were standing in

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.160
line, put the $50 down, and then we were on our way.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:22.280
It was really nicely handled, except for that whole not coming out until 9.30 to tell the

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.480
people in the back of the line, because, I mean, you've got 40 people in line that aren't

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.640
getting systems, and we saw the employees get there about 9 and 8.30, so these people

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.400
are just waiting there, waiting for somebody to tell them that they have to go home.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.180
What types of people did you see in line?

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.080
Was it all gaming nerds like you, or did you have the older parents?

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.240
I'm not a gaming nerd.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.160
You are, but that's beside the point.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.720
Were there any older people in the line?

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.720
Were there excited girls from college?

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:57.440
I saw maybe three girls, and then the front of the line comprised of scrawny white guys

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:06.020
and Asian guys, and then the back of the line were the older parents that maybe didn't realize

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:12.520
that they'd have to get there really early to get the systems preordered, so it was a

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.520
nice mix.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.840
I'm just asking that because I'm curious, because Nintendo is trying to reach everybody,

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840
but is it still the...

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.880
They're not going to reach everybody with a preorder that won't last longer than 10

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.880
minutes.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.160
I still don't think that preordering the Wii is all that big of a deal, just because Nintendo

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.120
loves us, and you know they're making lots of them.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:41.360
I just wanted the security, plus I kind of plan on maybe camping for the PS3, so I didn't

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:50.800
want to try to get to a nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd eBay, eBay, eBay.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800
And that's that.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800
All right.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800
Well, thanks for sharing your story.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800
We appreciate it.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800
That was very nice of you.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.080
All right.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.280
How about some more... Anything else you want to say on PS3 preorders?

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.280
Okay.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:09.840
Well, I mean, there are going to be more preorders, I'm sure, around the world and stuff.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:15.680
The whole thing is it's going to be very hard to come by, just very, very hard, so if you

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.560
are looking to get one, try to get it as soon as possible, because it is going to be like

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.000
the Xbox 360 was last year, and you might end up having to buy it on eBay if you really

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.280
want it or at day one.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.960
And to be honest, I mean, I would wait, I mean, if it were me, I would wait just because

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.560
a lot of the launch games you may be looking forward to are delayed until next year, so

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:43.160
just kind of keep that in mind when you're thinking about preordering it.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.680
All right.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.560
Let's go on to some more gaming news.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:54.960
Well, speaking of, back to the whole Sony camp, there is actually one thing that I am

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:00.120
personally excited about coming out on PSP, and that's After Burner.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:06.520
Sega did confirm they have a deal with Planet Moon Studios to do a PSP version, a new one

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:13.640
of After Burner, so if anyone who was into the original, hey, and there's a quote actually

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:20.860
from the CEO of Planet Moon, most importantly, it's approximately 9,000% more portable than

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.740
the original arcade cabinet.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:28.500
That just struck me as a stupid quote, but anyway, it's going to be called After Burner

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.120
Black Falcon.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:36.920
It will have 19 officially licensed customizable planes, a single player modem, and Wi-Fi multiplayer,

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.040
and they're slated for spring 2007.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.960
And I'd like to mention we also mentioned that back on episode 200.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.960
That was also one of the big stories we came out with, so I see one of those under the

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960
radar things.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960
Yes.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.240
Well, it's been confirmed, you're not a liar, Loki.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.240
Way to go.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240
I know.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.520
Full auto 2 on PSP, March 14th, 2007, heard it here first.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.280
Now if that's the one that doesn't happen, I'm going to laugh my ass off just to share.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.280
Okay.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:11.800
Speaking of Sony things, Eurogamer got a really in-depth look at PlayStation 3, the interface

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
and the online.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800
Check it out.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.400
They got a pretty in-depth article over at Eurogamer.net.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.000
Some of the highlights from their tour, of course, the PlayStation 3 is going to be using

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.280
what's called the cross media bar.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.840
So if you've played the PSP at all, you're already familiar with how the PS3 is going

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:31.600
to be set up, which is kind of interesting that they have that very similar layout between

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600
the two.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.720
It kind of makes me wonder if the Wii and DS are going to be similar like that too.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.880
I don't know.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.080
They talk about how you're going to have web browsing on the PlayStation 3, something that

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.000
the Xbox 360 does not have currently.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.560
Hopefully it will have better flash support and streaming media support.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.560
Hopefully.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.560
We'll see.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.920
Yes, sir, I would imagine it can run this stuff.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.860
There's the friends bar and there's different icons there.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.120
Your signed in friends show their own icons on the bar there.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:03.280
And then other icons would be those that are managing the PlayStation network account.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.560
There's a master account and associated accounts.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.040
So I'm assuming that's for like a family set up there.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.920
So you could also like with the master account limit what your kids do on their accounts

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.560
and how much they can spend on the PlayStation store, which is another section of the bar.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.000
And of course we all know SingStar is going to be huge on the PlayStation store right

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.140
out the gate.

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:27.920
So if you want to check out more on the tour of online and what to expect there, check

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920
it out at Eurogamer.net.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:33.200
And you know what's funny is the Sony store that they're going to have on there, no point

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.200
system like the Microsoft and Nintendo teams are doing.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.780
It's just going to be dollars or your currency.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.120
So that's kind of interesting I thought, I don't know.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.880
But there's a comment from Mike in the chat room.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.240
Loki is the only one that likes Full Auto.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.240
And maybe that's true.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.300
Maybe that's why no one else has been reporting on it, because you're the only person that

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.200
likes Full Auto.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:59.200
So I didn't care for After Burner, you know, I still reported on it.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.200
To be honest, Oblivion, it was a great game, but eh, so whatever.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.880
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.160
Oblivion, I mean Oblivion is more than a great game.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.520
I don't know about your, listen, Full Auto 2 is going to be fun with that one.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:18.120
Granted it's exactly the same as Full Auto 1, but it's still fun.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120
Whatever.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.900
Anyway, it's just to hold you over until they come out with a new Twisted Metal.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.440
That's all that matters right there.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.360
One thing that was kind of interesting, and we talked about it a little bit before about

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.820
Sony and the rumor that XFire is going to be teaming up with them for some online partnership

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:34.820
and stuff.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.920
And Sony came out and said, no, no, no, that's not true.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.920
That's only for one game.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.740
Actually, no, it is true.

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.040
It actually is going to be happening.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.840
It was officially announced.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:46.880
They're going to be using the middleware, or they're going to be kind of teaming up

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:54.280
for a middleware solution that's going to be an add-on to the current, I guess PS3 friends

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.960
list and chatting that they're going to have in the actual PS3.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.560
So this is going to be a little bit kind of tying into that, you know, being able to play

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.200
games on PC versus the PlayStation 3 and stuff like that.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.880
So as mentioned before, the first title they'll actually be using that will be the new Untold

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.920
Legends game.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.280
So it should be interesting.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.280
See how that turns out.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.280
I like XFire.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.520
I actually, I really like XFire.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.480
I think it's a pretty nice little app, even if MTV does own it, I really like it.

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.640
It's a cool little application.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.080
So that should be interesting.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.040
I could be some brownie points for the PlayStation 3 as far as I'm concerned.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:36.240
It's going to need as many brownie points as it can get, but as far as the delay circumstances,

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:42.160
there's actually a rumor that came out, one of the Spanish gaming sites called Meristations

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.840
said that Kudaragi warned there would be a shortage of PS3 stock in Japan and North America

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.440
and that Europe would have to wait even longer than they already are, but a Sony spokesperson

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:57.080
has said that that was categorically not true.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.360
I love how they always put modifiers on.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.200
He was eating crayons at the time.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.200
It's okay.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.200
Exactly.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.200
He was confused.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.280
He hasn't run any media briefings since the Tokyo game show.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.400
That's because they had him chained to his jungle gym in his house so that he wouldn't

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:18.360
go run out into traffic and die because they need him.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.640
To spread weird rumors.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:26.600
Well, at any rate, Sony is actually planning on shipping 6 million PS3 units on a global

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.720
scale by the end of the 2007 fiscal year.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.720
Cool.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.480
All right.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480
They can plan it.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.360
Whether it happens or not, hey.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.000
Do you think there will be further delays?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Despite all this?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.520
I don't doubt it.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.720
Possibly if they run into hardware problems.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.840
If they run into the overheating problems or anything like that.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.800
Something that they didn't foresee.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.640
Well, they actually remember all those issues they had with the first model PlayStation

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.640
2.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.600
Although, amazingly enough, I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2 and I've had

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:06.000
it for years and it hasn't had any problems, but a lot of them were having issues with

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.680
coming off track, overheating.

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.200
I'm seeing there actually being lots of issues for the PS3.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.760
All right.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.160
Let's go to some release dates.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.800
These are things that are coming out next week.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.840
For the most part, we know these aren't going to get delayed.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.200
Although, hell, even sometimes things get delayed at the last minute.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.320
In Japan, you can expect these games to be coming out very soon.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.800
On the PlayStation 2, October 19th, Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is out.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.440
A game called Gift Prism is coming out.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:41.720
It's from Syro Interactive, a very anime-ish looking game, but it's an adventure-type game.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.280
It's also coming in a limited edition.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.240
Everybody's Tennis is also coming out.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.120
The Korean version actually is coming out on October 19th.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.160
Sudoku Master on the PlayStation 2 should also be noted that various Wild Arms games

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.000
are coming out in Sony's version of the best hits, so you can get that cheaper through

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.040
your importer if you are looking for games such as that.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:10.320
Coming out on the DS, several games in the Kodomo no Tami no Yomi Kikashi series are

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320
coming out.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.200
I'm not sure what type of games those are.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.200
Children's something.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.200
Yeah.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.200
It's some type of children's game there.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200
It's just a miscellaneous.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.440
It's by Starfish who creates these games.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440
Several games in that series.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.240
It's pretty awesome.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.120
Yeah, if I understood any of what I just said, yeah, it would be pretty awesome.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:35.240
Well, anyways, but actually the US is going to be getting quite a bit of stuff as well.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:41.440
This week is a very good week for games, so lots of good stuff, including of course Bully,

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.360
the game that's been getting so much controversy lately on PlayStation 2.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.680
We have Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception on the PSP.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.680
Get your flight sim on there.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.400
If you're looking to get your flight sim on on the PC, Microsoft's Flight Simulator X

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:05.360
is going to be coming out, as well as Contact on the DS, Destroy All Humans 2 on PlayStation

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.360
2 and Xbox.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.080
The first one was really fun, so I'm looking forward to playing this one.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.200
Family Guy on PlayStation 2, PSP, and Xbox.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.320
That one actually looks pretty good.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.320
I kind of thought that was going to be a crappy port of a TV show, but it looks pretty good.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.680
And then 10 Dogs, Dalmatian, and Friends.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.600
Why this late in the game for those that were too lazy to unlock the Dalmatian in the first

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600
one?

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.600
Not lazy, you just had to find the hat.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.600
Anyways, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on the 360, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.600
also on the 360.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.360
I know Sims 2 Pets will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and DS, as well as SpongeBob Creature from

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.120
Krusty Krab on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.120
Yippee.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:13:02.200
And then finally, on the PC, we have Battlefield 2142, and that is going to be coming out as

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.360
well.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.160
But you know what?

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.920
Maybe you just don't have to tell them to go buy a game like that.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.440
So we are going to give one away.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.800
And how might you be able to do this, to enter in?

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.360
It's actually pretty simple.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.040
All you have to do, and this contest will be running until Wednesday, is go to orange

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:27.160
launch radio dot com slash BF2142, or Battlefield 2142.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:32.280
Just simply enter the contest there, and there will be a random drawing on Wednesday, and

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.360
we'll be announcing it in part A of episode 205.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.600
And they'll be able to get that right away.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.040
Yes, they'll be able to get it right away.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.240
It's actually a digital distribution thing.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:46.200
It's a digital download code, so you'll be able to download it straight to your PC.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.160
So I look forward to that, and I look forward to giving a full review about the game next

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160
week.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.680
Now, doesn't Desperate Housewives come out this week?

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.480
Because I noticed in our chat room, somebody had said they just saw a commercial on VH1.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480
Who said that?

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.800
I think that was last week, to be honest.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.800
Was it?

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:01.800
I think it was.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.720
Oh, JV Mon says, a commercial for the Desperate Housewives video game just aired on VH1, which

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.680
means someone's watching Flavor of Love.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.740
Same shame.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.520
His career should have stayed gone when public happened.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520
Or to name calling.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.200
I don't know, my attention was diverted elsewhere on the PC, whether it be Warcraft, Final Fantasy

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.040
11, Civilization, one of those other games.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.300
I might have to go back and check out some more.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:30.840
I just hear gelatinous cubes, and I think of all of my old D&D games.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.120
But also coming out is Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent on Xbox 360.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.320
A few other things to look forward to, by the way, is the new Blade Dancer game on PSP.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:48.400
Metal Slug, King of Fighters, Neo-Geo Battle Colosseum, more stuff.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.840
All right.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840
Down the line.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:58.760
Have fun, you folks over in Europe, playing your renamed version of Bully.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760
What is up with that?

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.760
I still don't get that.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.680
I guess Bully must have a real negative context overseas or something.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.920
Could someone please enlighten me from overseas?

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.920
What's wrong with the word Bully?

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.640
I don't know.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.960
This issue has been going back and forth and I'm getting to the point where I just don't

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.960
care anymore.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.480
I guess you could call this a follow-up.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.400
Last week we said something about how GameStop was tooting their horn that the Wii demo kiosks

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.200
were going to be exclusive to their store.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.240
Well guess what?

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.760
Nintendo of America says, uh-uh, playable Wii setups will be available at a variety

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.200
of retail outlets.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.360
We expect that anyone who wants to try Wii will be able to through multiple different

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.360
methods.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.720
In addition to retail outlets, Wii will be playable at a number of mall tours throughout

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.720
the company, the nationwide Nintendo Fusion Tour, and other grassroots consumer events,

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.280
which means Loki was misinformed about this when he told us this a couple months ago in

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.720
his big scoop when the sales people were there.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.960
GameStop was misinformed on this.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.360
Part of me is starting to wonder if Nintendo really knows what they're doing until the

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.720
last minute on these demo kiosks.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.120
I don't know, but whatever.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.120
Who knows?

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.960
Maybe it's just stuff changes every day.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.480
Now Nintendo has actually clarified that retailers will actually either be getting a traditional

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.160
pre-built interactive kiosk with the TV, Wii, and controllers, or just the Wii and controllers

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.560
that they can set up themselves.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.560
That's pretty low-tech.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.300
Hey, whatever works.

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.580
Maybe the whole thing, you know, I know this is getting into another story, but maybe the

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.840
whole thing has to do with interference from lighting and maybe not being able to control

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.720
it, and that might have something to do with it.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.840
I thought that was a bunch of BS, but whatever.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.840
Who knows?

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Whatever.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.440
It's just speculation right now.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:49.180
Well, an interesting rumor has come out about the Wii console is that it might actually

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:53.280
be running Linux already.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.480
So for those folks that love to install Linux on new things, whether it be the Nintendo

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:06.600
DS, the PSP, a toaster, a Billy Bass, whatever the hell, you know, too bad Nintendo beat

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600
you to it.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600
Yes, exactly.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:21.640
Apparently a Nintendo insider who blogs under the internet moniker Kiyoshi Saruwatari claims

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:28.640
that the Wii console will run an open source Linux OS, and of course it hasn't been confirmed

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:34.520
and it's purely speculation right now, but it's basically, you know, used for the back

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.900
end of, you know, using the software for, you know, porting stuff in there like the

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.360
Opera browser and stuff like that.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:47.160
And it says it will be closed and will only allow signed code, but of course, you know,

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.640
anyone that remembers that kind of stuff knows that people will break that pretty quick.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640
Good.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.840
Use it to break the region lock.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.120
That's the first thing I want you Linux nerds to work on if this is indeed true and the

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.480
Wii already has it on there.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.080
I want you to work on the region lock in case there's, you know, Oh and Don for the, you

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.080
know, Wii.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.400
I want that shit imported ASAP.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.400
Thank you.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.400
Could you imagine Oh and Don on the Wii?

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:14.600
I'm thinking about it and I'm wearing a warm smile.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.240
Well, as far as other things that are...

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.240
Hold on.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.240
I'd like to...

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.240
Sorry.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.240
And I hate having to read these.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.520
Bad transition.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520
Five points from Gryffindor.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.520
Hey.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.520
Anyways.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.160
I was on my way to a very wonderful transition.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.840
And this will be the last story that we have from Kiyoshi Sarawati because apparently the

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.960
whole thing was a practical joke made up by him to get spread around the world.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.560
So that will be nixed from the podcast.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.560
Thank you very much.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.080
So you just made up last five minutes.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080
Oh no.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080
I'm keeping that in.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080
Hey.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.720
I am reporting the news.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720
Okay.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.480
I said it was purely speculation and this is what this guy said.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.480
It's all his fault.

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480
Not mine.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.480
I just...

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.480
I just report the news.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.480
I think that's funny.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.480
Don't shoot the messenger.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.840
I think that's really freaking funny.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840
There's five minutes in my life.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.840
I won't get back.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.800
Speaking of things that I also think are funny is not really the story.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:16.160
Nintendo has announced a launch of Live Move, which is a development tool to make it easy

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.440
to produce titles for the Wii easier and faster.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:28.240
It was made by, I guess that would be iLive, an artificial intelligence specialist.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:35.940
At any rate, it's supposed to help allow a developer to train the Wii remote just by

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.940
performing motions.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:43.640
To quote on here from iLive's chairman Wei Yan, Live Move will allow the game industry

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:48.120
to move away from indirect digital control to more natural analog control for the first

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120
time.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:59.120
Ganyel Takeda, who's Nintendo's senior MD of integrated research and development, basically

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.760
said when Nintendo's development team saw Live Move, we instantly recognized how easy

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:08.280
it would greatly increase our ability to explore and experiment with new concepts and make

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.360
our lives easier.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.720
So I'm looking to see what they can come up with.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.780
Another quote on here that I think is really cool is, this revolutionary tool liberates

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.960
the imaginations of game creators, which I think actually the whole concept of having

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:30.360
something that you can use free motion to actually program with I think really just

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:36.120
links very well to the whole mission behind the Wii.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.320
You have innovative games, but you have innovative development going with it.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:45.080
Maybe some developers that want to see what's coming up in Nintendo's world might want to

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:51.380
check out the Nintendo Space World Show, of course the Nintendo World Show for short.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:57.880
It's going to be November 3rd in Nagoya and November 12th in Osaka.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.720
That was from Nintendo's official Japan site.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.020
So check it out if you're over in Japan and want to check out what Nintendo's up to because

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:10.440
remember they don't do Tokyo Game Show, so this is kind of their version of that.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:16.920
There will be of course hands-on Wii demos and new DS games.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.960
Start saving those pennies quick.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.240
Some interesting stuff that they're doing with the GameCube version of Twilight Princess

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.920
in Japan is only being offered online, kind of similar to what they do with Electroplankton

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.920
over here.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.320
The main reason Nintendo is doing this is to avoid both versions of the game in stores

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.800
at the same time because of the Wii launch.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.560
They would much rather see the Wii Zelda sell than the GameCube version and that wouldn't

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.520
be a guarantee if the two versions are on the same shelf.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.160
There is no information on whether this same procedure will be passed on to Europe and

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160
the U.S. as well.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160
Interesting.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.000
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see if they do that in the U.S. as well.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I don't think they will.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.040
I think there's a lot more demand for the old GameCube games here.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.480
I think there's a lot of folks that buy the earlier generations of consoles because they're

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.080
cheaper so I think they'll still be on shelves out here.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.840
You know what, some people might not want to use the Wii to play Zelda.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.980
Well, wasn't there an old story that said you could plug in the old GameCube controller

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.960
and use that on the Wii version still?

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:18.960
I don't know.

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.960
I don't remember.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.960
Maybe.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.920
For me, I had a discussion with Dan about this not too long ago.

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:29.000
He said that he's actually thinking about just picking it up on GameCube anyway instead

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
of on Wii.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.160
Just for the hell of it or just because of the controls?

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:38.240
The control, instead of a few things changed from the E3 demo version that I wasn't too

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:45.840
happy with, like not being able to use the remote actually for the sort at all, you have

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.840
to slash.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.840
Oh, weird.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:55.680
And I was like, nah, I don't like that so we're probably just getting it on GameCube.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.920
Or you might just have both because you're a whore for Link like that, right?

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:01.920
Maybe?

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:02.920
Well, I don't know.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:03.920
I didn't play Wind Waker.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.960
I refuse to play Wind Waker.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:09.260
Well that's a different, that's fake cartoony Link.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:12.080
That's not the real deal.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.480
Alright well that is about going to wrap it up for our part A but you know, over the past

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:20.600
few weeks we have not been able to end part A of Orange Lounge Radio until we get to some

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.780
DDR previews and that's what we're going to do right now.

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:29.560
We're going to take a look at some new tracks here from DDR Universe and DDR UltraMix 4.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.080
These are new Dance Dance Revolution games coming out from Konami a little bit later this

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.200
year, possibly early next year.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.720
We don't have a firm date on DDR Universe yet but we know sometime this winter the game

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720
is going to be out.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.520
So far December 2nd but that could always change.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.200
That could always be changed, absolutely.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.960
But it doesn't stop us from showing you some of the new mix by Jondi and Spesh and we're

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:55.440
going to hear the long mix right here on the DDR Sneak Peaks here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:16.160
coming to DDR Universe.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:39.260
Alright there we go.
