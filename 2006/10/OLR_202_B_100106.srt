00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:14,718
[SPEAKER_06]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:25,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 202 for this October the 1st of 2006.

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe the year is almost over at this point.

6
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:31,602
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

7
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:32,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

8
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:33,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Time just flies by.

9
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news.

10
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:37,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

11
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:41,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, let's start us off with the Zune.

12
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:43,254
[SPEAKER_08]: The Zune, it sounds like loon.

13
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:49,961
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, Microsoft's brand new MP3 movie, you name it, player.

14
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:55,739
[SPEAKER_08]: They announced some details at XO6 about how exactly it's going to work and some of the online things.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:03,743
[SPEAKER_08]: The 30GB version of the Zune will be sold for $249.99 when they're on sale November 14th in the United States.

16
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:07,385
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the price of music is in two choices.

17
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:14,449
[SPEAKER_08]: You can either buy a monthly pass for $0.99, which will give you hearing access to all the songs in the Zune marketplace.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,730
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is a catch.

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,732
[SPEAKER_08]: You will not be able to listen to the songs once the...

20
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:28,574
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to permanently buy any song, you can make it yours by spending 79 Microsoft points.

21
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:34,756
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, the same Microsoft points you would be buying Doom on Xbox Live Arcade you can be spending on music.

22
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:38,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, 79 points is roughly about 99 cents.

23
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:45,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can either purchase the song for 99 cents, or you can pay, I guess, a monthly fee and listen to all the music for 99 cents.

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,460
[SPEAKER_08]: But you probably have to download it each time.

25
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,061
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's kind of interesting.

26
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Debit and all that stuff were practically there.

27
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:13,679
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:36,288
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the technologies they were showing off was a thumbprint scanner.

29
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:45,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically a thumbprint scanner, and then you enter in your phone number, and you'll deduct money from your checking or savings account just using your thumbprint.

30
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:47,614
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty much going to be like the wave of the future.

31
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:59,882
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have this thing where they have a chip stored in a fake tooth that's fireproof, you know, bashproof pretty much, so that if you were to be horribly, say, horribly burned...

32
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,392
[SPEAKER_02]: In a fire, they can still identify your remains without DNA testing.

33
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:06,814
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your tooth there with your medical records and all your information.

34
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Without having to play, let's name the burn victim!

35
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to get back into gaming news.

36
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:13,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.

37
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, I was a big tech TV fangirl.

38
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:22,945
[SPEAKER_02]: For fans of Saints Row, there is a thing called the Thunky Fresh Pack.

39
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:23,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

40
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:28,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 100 Microsoft points, and it has clothes, tattoos, hairstyles...

41
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:40,816
[SPEAKER_02]: For use in single and multiplayer modes, you've also got tiger-striped underwear, bunny slippers, an eye patch, and a samurai helmet, medallions, and rattlesnake tattoos.

42
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:47,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, do I spend the 100 points to buy this crap, or should I get a copy of London Bridge for my Zune?

43
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:48,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know.

44
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:53,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh... Some people like the customization.

45
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people like Fergie.

46
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:55,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

47
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I had to listen to that CD yesterday.

48
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:03,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I characterize it as a pimp hat now, and it's dressed in really nice clothes.

49
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:12,344
[SPEAKER_08]: All purple, of course, because I've got to represent things for all colors in order to get the more, you know, I guess, points, you know, for missions and stuff.

50
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:22,246
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, I don't know, this was kind of like the same thing we were talking about, you know, a while back, which was rumored to be coming to the kiosk at GameStop for free, uh,

51
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:24,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Robotron 2084 Microsoft Points

52
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:54,977
[SPEAKER_07]: on Xbox 360, Satan's Hollow, Sinistar, Spy Hunter, and Tapper.

53
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:58,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you can play those all online on Midway's website.

54
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, if you want, it's midwayarcade.com.

55
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So, who needs Midway Arcade Treasures, huh?

56
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:04,846
[SPEAKER_07]: You got all that available for you.

57
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:05,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

58
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:06,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

59
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:07,369
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

60
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,312
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta save money for those PlayStation 3 games, of course.

61
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we mentioned earlier...

62
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:18,512
[SPEAKER_08]: They are going to be retailing for about $59.99 for the most part, which is expected.

63
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:33,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Most current-gen games are peaking at about $49.99, most actually which are $39.99 now, and now the next-gen games are going to try to be getting $59.99 retail for most everything.

64
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:42,065
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty much confirmed by, say, sites like SonyStyle and whatnot.

65
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:47,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Some games might not be $59.99 like Gran Turismo HD.

66
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,673
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a surprise, I would say.

67
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:57,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still waiting for those companies out there to get greedy and start charging more.

68
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,478
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as those $70 and $80 rumors don't come true.

69
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:01,998
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, I don't think they are.

70
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,722
[SPEAKER_08]: If anything, they'll try to nickel and dime you on the back end with their online content.

71
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:08,942
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it's going to end up being.

72
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:10,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of

73
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Charging $70, they can charge $900 and charge $50 for the game or something.

74
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:17,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie.

75
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:19,057
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

76
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:19,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie.

77
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:19,817
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

78
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:20,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie.

79
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:20,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie.

80
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:21,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie.

81
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:22,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

82
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

85
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

86
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:23,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

87
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:24,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

88
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I win.

89
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:27,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Release dates.

90
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:30,866
[SPEAKER_02]: UK release dates.

91
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,689
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the ferret translating.

92
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

93
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

94
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:42,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on 1st October, VeggieTales, Larry Boy and the Bad Apple on Game Boy Advance and PlayStation 2.

95
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:47,587
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 6th, we have Barnyard for a bunch of stuff.

96
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:59,835
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Capcom Puzzle World on PSP, Heroes of Annihilated Empires on the PC, Import Tuner Challenge on Xbox 360, Mage Knight Apocalypse on PC, the Nintendo DS browser on the PSP.

97
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:01,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the DS.

98
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:04,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a bad joke.

99
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Open Season coming out on damn near everything.

100
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Put out by Ubisoft.

101
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild Arms 4 on PlayStation 2.

102
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say the Wild Arms series is a good game.

103
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:20,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend who's absolutely addicted to that game, so Wild Arms 4 is good.

104
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Wild Arms Ultra F ever come out over there?

105
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a series I played.

106
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, let me know if it ever came out.

107
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:34,896
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things coming up though in the months to look forward to is Power Stone Collection for PSP.

108
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,160
[SPEAKER_02]: English Training, Have Fun Improving Your Skills on the DS.

109
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,501
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually pretty funny.

110
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:45,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And Resident Evil 4 Platinum, Sims 2 Pets coming out.

111
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:52,352
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting Dragon Ball Z, Tenkaichi Budokai 2, and Metal Slug Anthology.

112
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:56,015
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

113
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The US isn't going to see too much this week.

114
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:01,280
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some pretty good games there.

115
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:05,869
[SPEAKER_08]: FIFA Soccer 07, if you're a soccer fan, coming out in almost every single system.

116
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,311
[SPEAKER_08]: You do have also Star Trek Encounters coming out in the PlayStation 2.

117
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,452
[SPEAKER_08]: A great Star Trek combat game.

118
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cheap.

119
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:15,933
$19.99.

120
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So, check it out if you can.

121
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:21,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, actually, it might even be $14.99.

122
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's very cheap, but that's all I know.

123
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:28,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, another crappy game, Snowcross 2, featuring Air Blur Morgan.

124
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:32,947
[SPEAKER_08]: and, by the way, this game has been delayed for a year, so it's crap.

125
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:43,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Mercury Meltdown for the PSP, which, you know, sequel for the first Mercury game, and I don't know if this is worth your money, but if you want, pick it up.

126
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:46,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Gangs of London, definitely a better game for the PSP.

127
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:54,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, on the PC, we have El Matador and Paparazzi.

128
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's some interesting stuff.

129
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:00,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And, how could I not forget, Scarface, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

130
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:07,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, a lot of places are reporting that this is the 8th of October, but it's actually the 5th.

131
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:13,191
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a soft street date on it, so stores will be getting it on the 5th, but they cannot advertise it until the 8th.

132
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:14,572
[SPEAKER_08]: So, weird.

133
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:18,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Go bug your GameStops, because that's probably the game you're going to want that week.

134
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, over in Japan, we have some release dates for the week.

135
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:25,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, not a whole lot coming out this week.

136
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a slow week over there as well.

137
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:32,778
[SPEAKER_07]: NBA Live 07 and FIFA Soccer 07, both coming out this week.

138
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Shinobido Imashime, also known as Spike the Best, is coming out over there this week as well.

139
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:44,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is coming out this week.

140
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:49,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Front Mission 5 in the Ultimate Hits Collection hit stores this week in Japan as well.

141
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:57,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And for you music game fans who have about $250 to spare, you can get your Guitar Freaks ASC arcade-style controller this week.

142
00:09:58,936 --> 00:09:59,457
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

143
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:10,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as far as other releases for the UK going back to them, they're actually for fans who are football fans.

144
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,174
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Pro Evolution Soccer 6 coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC on 27th October.

145
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, not by Konami.

146
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,178
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP and DS versions will be coming.

147
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:33,887
[SPEAKER_02]: There are... They're actually stating that the 360 version is going to be noticeably improved.

148
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:37,750
[SPEAKER_02]: The AI, anyway, is... There will be...

149
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:44,496
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually specifically named it in areas like the AI players running into space.

150
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to happen.

151
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:47,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Also runs in high definition and widescreen.

152
00:10:48,637 --> 00:11:00,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It will also feature new licensed clubs including Manchester United, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, and Olympiasos.

153
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: New kits and squads for Czech, French, Australian, English, Italian, Argentinian teams.

154
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish and Swedish National.

155
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:14,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I know we've got some football fans listening.

156
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:16,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Goal!

157
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's so hot.

158
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,556
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

159
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:11,886
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's up for doing more 2D Castlevanias, so maybe we'll see some exclusive stuff on the next-gen marketplaces.

160
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, some more 2D Castlevania.

161
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:19,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just, even just some, you know, you can do that subtle hints of 3D, kind of like if you look at Symphony of the Night.

162
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:24,350
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just make a real grand 2D Castlevania for the next-gen.

163
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it would be awesome.

164
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because, you know, your next-gen doesn't mean everything has to be 3D.

165
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:30,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at a game like Beautiful Joe.

166
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:32,453
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great 2D using next-gen graphics.

167
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:33,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

168
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:39,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, if you still want to live in the current generation, well, this might be the controller for you.

169
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:43,727
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a controller that would be great for throwing against the wall.

170
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:53,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody has a friend like this, somebody who gets so frustrated, or maybe a sibling, that they throw the controller against the wall, or they throw it at people when they get really frustrated with the game.

171
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:56,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now you have a Nerf controller.

172
00:12:57,134 --> 00:13:00,036
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, there's a PlayStation 2 controller that's covered in Nerf,

173
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like this bluish color here.

174
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:05,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's coming out for the PlayStation 2.

175
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's wireless.

176
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes in black, blue, red, or orange.

177
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,562
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be about $30 and comes out in November of 2006.

178
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:14,724
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, the official Nerf controller.

179
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:16,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect for throwing around.

180
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I wouldn't recommend it.

181
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:18,887
[SPEAKER_07]: You could still break the damn thing.

182
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:20,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Or somebody.

183
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's still kind of heavy.

184
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because it's Nerf made doesn't mean it's safe to chuck at people's heads.

185
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,593
[SPEAKER_07]: But it at least would hurt a lot less.

186
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:40,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking about breaking people, there was the Uwe Boll boxing matches going on recently, and as expected, you know, nothing's going to be fair when it comes down to Uwe Boll.

187
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:53,327
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, actually, Richard Lotax Kanka was one of the people from Something Awful to actually be able to fight in this, and he kind of gave a little bit of a

188
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:55,356
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

189
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,031
[SPEAKER_08]: and Oogaball doesn't like a fair fight.

190
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:36,139
[SPEAKER_08]: So, out of the four people, including one 17-year-old, everyone pretty much got beat the crap out of.

191
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that legal?

192
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:39,862
[SPEAKER_07]: To beat the crap out of a 17-year-old like that?

193
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:40,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it was Canada.

194
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:41,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the laws are different there.

195
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

196
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:44,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess he signed a waiver.

197
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:45,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the parents signed a waiver as well.

198
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: The video's out there on YouTube, so check it out.

199
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:52,432
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, I don't know.

200
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:53,193
[SPEAKER_08]: In the

201
00:14:53,995 --> 00:15:03,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Richard Lotex, his whole thing is he didn't really hate Uebol before this whole thing, and now he does.

202
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,750
[SPEAKER_08]: He thinks he's a douche, basically.

203
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:11,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderdog Harold sums it up in our chatroom and says, Uebol is such a pig fucker.

204
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,204
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

205
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:12,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, big deal.

206
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:14,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So you beat up some critics.

207
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:20,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, you beat up critics that had no boxing training, and then one person that actually might give you some competition.

208
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:21,928
[SPEAKER_08]: You pussied out, you fucker.

209
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:27,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't one of the critics that came out of this say that, you know, although the fight was kind of a joke, the new movie's not bad?

210
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Or something like the clips they saw from the new movie didn't seem that bad?

211
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see how they could mess up, you know, Postal.

212
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:37,373
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it doesn't... That one I'm interested in seeing, actually.

213
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the new movie, in the name of the king or whatever...

214
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,041
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

215
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, Robway linked me this article.

216
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:11,214
[SPEAKER_02]: He's aligning himself with the defense for some case.

217
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a bunch of bullshit.

218
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:17,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you'll notice I purposefully omitted that from tonight's show role because I didn't want to give him any more attention.

219
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:17,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

220
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:24,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the one thing that I think is worth mentioning for this is that it's probably something to likely get him disbarred in that state, so let's hope that happens.

221
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

222
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:31,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, God, all this talk of Uwe Boll and Jack Thompson puts me in a foul mood, so you know what that means, right, DarkSakura?

223
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:50,151
[SPEAKER_02]: FUs of the Week, DarkSakura My FU of the Week goes primarily, there are some exceptions, to straight men.

224
00:16:52,013 --> 00:17:03,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, just because I'm a woman doesn't give you the right to look at me, see me there, and then proceed to back into me and elbow me in the shoulder while trying to take a picture at the wax museum.

225
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:08,730
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it doesn't give you permission to just expect me to move out of the way when you're gonna open a door.

226
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid to be there.

227
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:12,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You are going to freaking respect my personal space.

228
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:13,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

229
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:14,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And your cock.

230
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:17,515
[SPEAKER_07]: But not literally.

231
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:17,815
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

232
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:24,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to this whole attitude of I'm a man, you're a woman, you have to move, you have to do what I say, blah blah blah.

233
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

234
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

235
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:29,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

236
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:33,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole... I hate how...

237
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're not... this isn't... Well, I'm just saying, how did you know his sexual orientation?

238
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:40,376
[SPEAKER_02]: His wife was there.

239
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:42,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that mean anything?

240
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:43,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

241
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I have infallible gay darks.

242
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:57,013
[SPEAKER_02]: These people... The only way that I think that there would be any remotely gay vibe coming from them is if they were like, you know, bare leather daddies or something.

243
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:05,539
[SPEAKER_07]: All our listeners of the show are accepted from this, fuck you, right?

244
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,480
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna drink beer and go to Hooters

245
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:31,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna, to quote Margaret Cho, we're gonna order titties with ranch dressing and celery sticks.

246
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:37,740
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just... Okay.

247
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,141
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

248
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:43,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, like I said, this is not centered toward all straight men.

249
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:45,705
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just centered toward stupid straight men.

250
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:51,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Loki, speaking of stupid straight men, Loki, you know they actually serve Hooters at Hooters?

251
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:55,290
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be worth, you know, a price of admission right there, but their food's actually

252
00:18:55,882 --> 00:19:06,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no, actually, ironically enough, fuck you, the stupid women drivers who can't fucking pay attention on the road because you're talking to your kids or talking on the cell phone or fucking around with something on your dash.

253
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:20,959
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know I understand that those complex SUVs that you drive are so, you know, beyond you, but, you know, could you do us all a favor and stay at home so I don't have to bother, you know, driving behind you because you're too fucking slow or retarded?

254
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

255
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:26,185
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to remember we have... Mail drivers are worse.

256
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,207
[SPEAKER_07]: We have folks all around the world listening and not everyone knows what Hooters is.

257
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:39,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooters is this eerie where you can order hot wings and that's about all that's decent on the menu and they're not even very good because it tastes like vinegar.

258
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:44,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're served by women wearing really small gym shorts.

259
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheerleader outfits, essentially.

260
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite, because they're not little skirts.

261
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:51,418
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just this uber... They're the shorts that you can see ash cheeks through.

262
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:52,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

263
00:19:53,411 --> 00:20:20,070
[SPEAKER_02]: and actually I read an article about a girl who went inside on Hooters just to try to find out what went on behind the scenes they ask you what your t-shirt size is and they give you one that's two sizes too small lovely and basically you're there for boobs which I have no problem with personally but I hate the whole mentality that spawned it and a question from our chatroom from someone from abroad who doesn't know better is there a male version?

264
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,152
[SPEAKER_02]: there should be when I was in high school

265
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,702
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my people who was in band with me that I used to march next to, she said that they should open a restaurant called Peckers.

266
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:31,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it's men in speedos that wear their aprons backwards.

267
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:33,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have any other FUs?

268
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:35,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

269
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:43,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Just actually the Hooters, this is kind of an old FU, but FU the Hooters because their service does suck.

270
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:47,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you might go there saying, oh yeah, we're going to go get served by hot chicks.

271
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:50,420
[SPEAKER_08]: The chicks are dumb and the service is awful.

272
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:59,214
[SPEAKER_08]: and they can't get anything right and it took them like two hours to serve like hot wings which is their staple food at this goddamn place and they can't prepare that even quick enough.

273
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:04,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they, you know, jump around and dance and stuff and just act obnoxious and annoying the whole time.

274
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:10,461
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obviously not worth the trip, so go to a strip club if you really want to eat with boobs around you.

275
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:11,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

276
00:21:11,642 --> 00:21:13,583
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that one strip club that you said had really good food?

277
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was Centerfolds.

278
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:16,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go?

279
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:16,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

280
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:17,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun.

281
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:17,806
Okay.

282
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:19,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't... Well, Nellie will want to go.

283
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:20,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll all go.

284
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:25,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be at OLR, uh... We'll have a staff... Let's have a staff meeting at Centerfolds.

285
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:25,597
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun.

286
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be excellent.

287
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:27,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll do that.

288
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:28,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next OLR staff meeting at the Titty Bar.

289
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:33,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Let's see, um... My F.U.

290
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:37,263
[SPEAKER_07]: of the week goes to Philips, the company that made my last television.

291
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:42,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Just over one year after buying the thing, it stopped working.

292
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,341
[SPEAKER_07]: You would turn on the TV, my nice new high-definition TV.

293
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:48,782
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd turn it on, then the image would get really bright, and then it would shut off.

294
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:49,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And it broke.

295
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:50,942
[SPEAKER_07]: The damn TV broke.

296
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:54,223
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you to Costco, who's now my favorite store ever.

297
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:56,264
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the best return policy in the world.

298
00:21:56,304 --> 00:22:01,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I took the TV back and got a new TV from a different company that hopefully will work for more than a year.

299
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But it has a red eye of death on it, like that 360?

300
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:04,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

301
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:06,876
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it did not have the three rings of death on it.

302
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:11,159
[SPEAKER_07]: It would shut off and then that little flashing green light would come on.

303
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Flash, flash, flash, and that's all it would do.

304
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:13,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm tempting you.

305
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:15,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I have power, but I'm not going to work.

306
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:21,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby's offering to fly out here for the staff meeting.

307
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,409
[SPEAKER_07]: You are more than welcome to attend.

308
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:26,770
[SPEAKER_07]: We can talk about all games business as well at the meeting.

309
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be pretty funny.

310
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: That just sounds like it would be lots of fun.

311
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:32,468
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

312
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:43,642
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

313
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:43,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um...

314
00:23:09,441 --> 00:23:19,308
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going back into the news now, and this has absolutely nothing to do with titties, but it is a little foul.

315
00:23:19,368 --> 00:23:23,511
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever watch South Park, it's a little bit dirty, but in that way that we all love.

316
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:34,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it looks like on South Park's season premiere, they're going to be spoofing World of Warcraft, and a little 15-second teaser hit the internet this week.

317
00:23:35,336 --> 00:24:03,705
[SPEAKER_07]: and it says the World of Warcraft shows the World of Warcraft and then we hear that all too familiar voice yes that's right this Wednesday on Comedy Central that should be interesting World of Warcraft is gonna be hitting South Park yeah you know I enjoy South Park I've seen quite a few episodes it's one of my guilty pleasures

318
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:06,087
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm sure it's going to be hilarious.

319
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:07,768
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they've spoofed games before.

320
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:15,474
[SPEAKER_07]: They've spoofed DDR and they've spoofed the Golden PSP.

321
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that whole episode with the Terry Shivo thing?

322
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:17,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

323
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so they've spoofed stuff before.

324
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:26,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So we thought it would be fun to bring back an old favorite segment of ours tonight and have a little fun with this topic.

325
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:27,822
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play Listless!

326
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:28,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Listless!

327
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:41,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the way Listless works is that we're going to come up with the definitive list of Orange Lounge Radio's top something with whatever category we're doing tonight.

328
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:48,057
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a follow-up to this story, the category we're going to do tonight is game that South Park most needs to make fun of.

329
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:51,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, obviously, we can't do World of Warcraft and we can't do DDR.

330
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:53,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the way Listless works.

331
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,855
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the hosts are going to go around and name their top three, and then we're going to go around and eliminate one off the list.

332
00:24:59,895 --> 00:25:02,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So it gets a little vicious in here, okay?

333
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:10,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, usually this game is played with four people, but since there's only three of us here in studio, we've asked one of our frequent callers and emailers to join us tonight.

334
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:11,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Caller, are you there?

335
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:12,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no.

336
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you must be, smartass.

337
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:16,187
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your name?

338
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:16,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Introduce yourself.

339
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:17,929
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN, DMN, DMN

340
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And just for that smart-ass remark, I'm going to make you go first.

341
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:52,235
[SPEAKER_07]: What would be your number three pick for a game that South Park most needs to make fun of?

342
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:53,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Night Trap.

343
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:54,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Night Trap!

344
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Winner.

345
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,737
[SPEAKER_07]: The old Sega CD game starring Dana Plato.

346
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:00,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

347
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:01,497
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great one.

348
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:01,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

349
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good at this game, DMN.

350
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:05,778
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see if the rest of your list is up to par, though.

351
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,658
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, well, not yet, not yet.

352
00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:08,379
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to go to Loki.

353
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:09,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you're number three.

354
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:14,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say Grand Theft Auto.

355
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:17,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, DarkSakura, Karaoke Revolution,

356
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy Xenoverse

357
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:07,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So far on our list, we have Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Karaoke Revolution, and Final Fantasy.

358
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:11,463
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN, what would be your number two pick?

359
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:13,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Custer's Revenge.

360
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Custer's Revenge.

361
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:21,150
[SPEAKER_07]: The old Atari 2600 classic, yes?

362
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:21,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

363
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:26,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, where you can rape and pillage in very, very pixelated format.

364
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:28,536
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be interesting to see on South Park.

365
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

366
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:30,955
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your number two pick.

367
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:31,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Kart.

368
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:31,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Kart!

369
00:27:56,658 --> 00:28:01,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Just imagine, like, they throw, uh, what was the little, what was the ball-shaped kid's name?

370
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:02,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

371
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:02,919
[SPEAKER_02]: The little Canadian.

372
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:03,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Ike?

373
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Ike.

374
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,460
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they throw Ike as a, as a thing, and then throw, like, like, Kenny's head.

375
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they have, like, a South Park game that was kind of like Mario Kart?

376
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:12,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

377
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:12,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

378
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,882
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit, but they never really referenced it on the show, so I guess it could work.

379
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:16,582
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll see.

380
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,463
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, um, let's see, my number two.

381
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:21,543
[SPEAKER_07]: My number two would be, uh, Silent Hill.

382
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to draw that now, you know.

383
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:30,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, seeing as we're on the topic of crappy games, I thought I'd say, hey, why doesn't South Park make fun of South Park?

384
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:30,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

385
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:55,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, interesting little play.

386
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Why doesn't South Park make fun of itself and its own crappy game that came out?

387
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good thought, good thought.

388
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one, the Nintendo 64 one?

389
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:03,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

390
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:03,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay, good.

391
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:05,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Loki, your number one pick.

392
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't hate, but Katamari Damacy.

393
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:10,106
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be funny.

394
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that idea.

395
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Katamari Damacy.

396
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:18,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see that commercial this week that was kind of inspired by Katamari Damacy?

397
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:21,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, except they say the people who made it say it

398
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,469
[SPEAKER_07]: They were not inspired by the game in any way.

399
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:24,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch TV, so I have no idea what it is.

400
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,651
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on YouTube.

401
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:26,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

402
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:27,152
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the new TV.

403
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:29,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, DarkSakura, what would be your number one?

404
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,114
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sims.

405
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,596
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sims!

406
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:32,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a good one as well.

407
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:36,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine they do have somebody controlling them walking around town.

408
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Good one, good one.

409
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:43,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, first, before I name my number one, let's go and look at some chatroom picks.

410
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:45,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's some things the chatroom are suggesting.

411
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:48,149
[SPEAKER_07]: OLArmyEddy says, Dead or Alive.

412
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,611
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, Mortal Kombat.

413
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:51,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

414
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:53,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Drunami says Africa.

415
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:56,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Meklar says Loco Roco.

416
00:29:56,852 --> 00:29:58,632
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says Genji 2.

417
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Raven's Dolphin says Dead Rising.

418
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Blazer says Gradius.

419
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:04,695
[SPEAKER_07]: All very good guesses.

420
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Loco Roco would be funny with Cartman.

421
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:07,336
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be funny.

422
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:10,578
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Your Mom the Game last night?

423
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:11,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is in bed.

424
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:12,879
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here it is.

425
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,960
[SPEAKER_07]: My number one pick is none of those.

426
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,182
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game that desperately needs to be made fun of, especially after this week that I got my hands on it.

427
00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:22,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic the Hedgehog for 360.

428
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:35,909
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so here's the list as it stands so far, and we're going to have to take one of these off the list, DMN.

429
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:42,895
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to take one of these off the list, and unfortunately the chat room will not be able to vote for it because you've ruined their hopes and dreams to be able to vote for it.

430
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:43,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

431
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:44,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the list as it stands so far.

432
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:45,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Night Trap.

433
00:30:46,371 --> 00:31:02,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Karaoke Revolution, Final Fantasy, Custer's Revenge, Twisted Metal, Mario Kart, Silent Hill, South Park the Game, Katamari Damacy, The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.

434
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,295
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN, which one of these do you say South Park should not make fun of?

435
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:07,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Which come off the list?

436
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:11,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Twisted Metal.

437
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Twisted Metal!

438
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:15,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was a little obscure, wasn't it?

439
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:18,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Night Trap would be too obscure.

440
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:43,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Night Trap is too obscure.

441
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:53,855
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I agree, either Night Trap or like Sewer Shark or something, nobody, unless they were in our, you know, age range of gamer, probably wouldn't get it.

442
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:54,876
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

443
00:31:56,017 --> 00:32:00,381
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot, you know what, every pick that's left here is actually pretty good, so this is hard for me to take one off.

444
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:04,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take off, Jamie, don't hate me, I'm taking off Karaoke Revolution.

445
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:05,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

446
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:08,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Because since they already made fun of DDR, it's kind of close for me, so...

447
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:23,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here we go, chat room, you now have the chance to vote on your favorite.

448
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:28,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I need you to give a number one and a number two, and here is what you get to vote on.

449
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:31,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and DMN, you don't get to vote, because you already helped.

450
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is, here's the list, and I posted it there in chat.

451
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:43,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Final Fantasy, Custer's Revenge, Mario Kart, Silent Hill, Katamari Damacy, The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.

452
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:46,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Place votes now.

453
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:48,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Your number one and number two picks.

454
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:51,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

455
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, it doesn't count unless it's over a private message.

456
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:57,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll tally up the votes and reveal it shortly here in the show.

457
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:58,458
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN, thanks for your help.

458
00:32:59,366 --> 00:32:59,926
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

459
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:00,706
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have a good night.

460
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, some interesting stuff.

461
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:29,437
[SPEAKER_08]: This could also be, I guess, parodied on South Park, but the whole controversy with Bully.

462
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:31,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, people were wrong.

463
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:46,862
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, you know, Bully has been shown to, E3 was shown to very few press people, but now that it's almost out, actually in the next couple weeks, it's been shown to a lot more people.

464
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:52,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, the game itself, which garnered a teen rating, isn't a

465
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,158
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

466
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:21,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, speaking of politically oriented things, you know, we love those guys over at GamePolitics.

467
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:35,431
[SPEAKER_07]: We just wanted to give a mention that GamePolitics.com has launched this week, and unfortunately it means they have come off of LiveJournal for their commenting system, but they have a fancy schmancy new website made in WordPress, so you should check it out, GamePolitics.com.

468
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,692
[SPEAKER_07]: We just wanted to give them a shout out.

469
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,791
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura is going to give another website a shout out right now because she surfs the web up and down every week.

470
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:43,411
[SPEAKER_07]: At work.

471
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:47,512
[SPEAKER_07]: At work, so she can find a pick worthy to share with the rest of you all.

472
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:48,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's her website of the week.

473
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:49,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

474
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:56,155
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we should really be using the Mr. Rogers music for this part.

475
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:56,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe next week.

476
00:34:57,015 --> 00:34:57,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

477
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:08,103
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, my site of the week is actually one that another of our listeners linked to me when I did the Doctor Who site last week, but it's actually a very good Doctor Who fan site.

478
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:10,144
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Doctor Who Online.

479
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:23,729
[SPEAKER_02]: The website address is doctorwho-online.co.uk and doctor is drwho-online.co.uk Oh my god, this site is fantastic.

480
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,951
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have the Doctor Who Online WhoCast

481
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:32,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm going to be giving a try within the week.

482
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:35,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of really good stuff.

483
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:38,037
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a little area called Psychic Paper.

484
00:35:38,698 --> 00:35:39,718
[SPEAKER_02]: References.

485
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot of stuff.

486
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Even an eBay link to a shop.

487
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:46,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really fantastic site.

488
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:51,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So I suggest going to it if there's a place to comment.

489
00:35:51,545 --> 00:35:52,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Some orange on the radio sent you.

490
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:54,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

491
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:56,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

492
00:35:57,303 --> 00:36:02,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Got some cool stuff here, especially from the folks that make Gears of War epic.

493
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:11,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Their thought on the whole Xbox 360 is you don't need to have an HDTV to be able to enjoy their games.

494
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:19,738
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they are making sure by testing their game, Gears of War, on a bunch of small SDTVs

495
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure that you can read the text in the game.

496
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:29,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlike, say, Capcom, who couldn't give a flying fuck that you don't have a HDTV.

497
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,537
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least someone's getting it right.

498
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:32,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's awfully good.

499
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:34,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Very reassuring.

500
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:43,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, another reassuring news, actually, for anyone who's thinking that, oh, Wii's coming out, I don't have to keep my GameCube stuff.

501
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:44,221
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

502
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:49,703
[SPEAKER_02]: The WaveBirds are apparently going to be able to be used on the Wii.

503
00:36:50,325 --> 00:37:09,707
[SPEAKER_02]: and certain Wii games you will still need your receiver plug-in there's a slot on top of the console that you can plug that into but there's not really any word out as far as how well it's going to work with virtual console but it's apparently going to work with the Wii anyway so yay

504
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:18,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, I'm still trying to tally up the listless votes, so maybe we ought to just go on to our next story.

505
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:22,755
[SPEAKER_07]: We got flooded with, we have over 50 votes tonight for listless.

506
00:37:22,795 --> 00:37:23,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to crazy tally them up.

507
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:25,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Bobby, nice try, nice try.

508
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:36,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, for anybody who is a bit of a snake charmer, you can play with your snake, in public no less, and not get arrested for it.

509
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:44,469
[SPEAKER_02]: There are already Metal Gear Solid 4 figures that will go out with the release of the game on the PS3.

510
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,831
[SPEAKER_02]: A 12-inch tall made by Medicom.

511
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicom puts out some really nice figures, by the way.

512
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:57,595
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a prototype model up on GayGamer.net that looks pretty cool.

513
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Snake's just really old, though.

514
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:00,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

515
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:04,598
[SPEAKER_02]: But the figure, though, is...

516
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:15,989
[SPEAKER_02]: They're stating that it may be something about 95,000 yen up to maybe 20,000.

517
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

518
00:38:19,852 --> 00:38:24,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think the comment on the form here is Snake's got a great ass for an old guy.

519
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:26,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

520
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Snake does have a good ass for an old guy.

521
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rob, how's Italian going?

522
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:34,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost done.

523
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:37,078
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

524
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:02,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's awesome.

525
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:02,875
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be awesome.

526
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:05,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you can always call us.

527
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:13,939
[SPEAKER_07]: The other free way would be to go on to OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on Interact With Us, and get the information on Skype, username OrangeLoungeRadio.

528
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it, Loki.

529
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:23,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, as we like to do every week, we're reporting some stuff that you might not know yet because it hasn't been reported on the front of a magazine.

530
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:29,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the first, of course, actually the only one I have this week is Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360.

531
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:30,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Dropdown to $39.99.

532
00:39:32,063 --> 00:39:35,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you don't own it yet, might be a time to find a used one.

533
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:37,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, they should be even cheaper than that.

534
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:43,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I mean, Call of Duty 3 is coming out in November, so whatever.

535
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good game, though.

536
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely worth the multiplayer, so check it out.

537
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other fun news.

538
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:54,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo, there was a whole controversy about the Wii using the friend codes.

539
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're going to make it a little bit easier on you.

540
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:59,095
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be using the friend's code system

541
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:03,508
[SPEAKER_08]: However, they are going to only require that you have one friend code.

542
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll be able to share that friend code and then be friended for all the other games.

543
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:12,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is good, you know, at least a good way to do that.

544
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:14,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear I had that in the show role.

545
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:14,837
[SPEAKER_08]: That's crazy.

546
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:15,618
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

547
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:17,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's some other stuff.

548
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:20,402
[SPEAKER_08]: There was actually legislation...

549
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:28,546
[SPEAKER_08]: That's in the house right now to require the ESRB to actually play through the entire game before reviewing them.

550
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of interesting.

551
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:33,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to work because, you know, that would take forever.

552
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It would seriously delay the release of all games.

553
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:40,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It would delay games, and how would you do, like, MMOs or games that have new content added to them constantly?

554
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:42,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to work.

555
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unrealistic.

556
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:48,116
[SPEAKER_08]: And why are they having, why is the government concerning themselves with this kind of stuff anyways?

557
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:48,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

558
00:40:49,606 --> 00:41:02,735
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think should be is that I think that on the websites there should be a parent link for any internet savvy parent to go online, get content warnings of the games more in depth.

559
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:07,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the manufacturer does have a degree of responsibility to make sure that...

560
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:17,061
[SPEAKER_02]: They give accurate listings, but if they're really so concerned about it, then they can make it a requirement for the manufacturers to have more information made available.

561
00:41:17,482 --> 00:41:23,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you know how when you buy food, it says for nutritional content, write into this address or go on this website?

562
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:24,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be the same thing.

563
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:32,149
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I think that it really is up to the parent to do the research before allowing their child to buy the game.

564
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:37,032
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as children, though, buying the games without their parents' permission, oh well.

565
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:37,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

566
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:43,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other fun stuff, Rockstar announced a brand new series this week actually called L.A.

567
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:55,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Noire, and more information should be coming out when the official trailer is released on October 5th, and if you want more information on that, you can visit rockstargames.com slash L.A.

568
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:06,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Noire, that's L-A-N-O-I-R-E, and looks like it's going to be a game that, of course, you know, kind of pays tribute to a lot of the film noir movies, much like, you

569
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:12,839
[SPEAKER_08]: LA Confidential, or even if you want to go really old, the Maltese Falcon.

570
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,141
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be pretty cool.

571
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of Grand Theft Auto-ish.

572
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:19,282
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm looking forward to that.

573
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.

574
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:26,626
[SPEAKER_08]: As we mentioned before, Sierra is planning on releasing some games to Xbox Live Arcade.

575
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:27,706
[SPEAKER_08]: King's Quest?

576
00:42:27,726 --> 00:42:28,627
[SPEAKER_08]: King's Quest?

577
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:29,167
[SPEAKER_08]: King's Quest?

578
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:30,948
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not yet.

579
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:31,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it!

580
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:37,031
[SPEAKER_08]: The first couple of games that were announced, Assault Heroes, which is going to be another over-the-head...

581
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:44,946
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of shooter game that, you know, using two analog sticks, think, you know, Geometry Wars, but still pretty cool.

582
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:52,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my favorite game, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, and that was a really fun mini golf game.

583
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:53,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to piss off people with that.

584
00:42:54,572 --> 00:43:01,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Codemasters also announced the X-06 Sensible Soccer, which I think was announced even before that.

585
00:43:02,337 --> 00:43:06,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, a very classic game should be making its way.

586
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:09,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to go to the chat room for some comments here.

587
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:13,779
[SPEAKER_07]: DNL, who, by the way, posted some great artwork to our LiveJournal community this week.

588
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out if you're a user of LiveJournal or Community Orange Lounge on there.

589
00:43:17,622 --> 00:43:25,427
[SPEAKER_07]: DNL says, in regards to the ESRB thing, on the back of the package it does say ESRB content rating, www.esrb.org.

590
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:32,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And also something I wanted to add on that whole ESRB thing is that when you play a game online, you always do get that, you know, warning that comes up.

591
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:36,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Warning, game experience may change with online play, do-do-do, type thing, so...

592
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to think about.

593
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I finally have some results for you guys.

594
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:43,181
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

595
00:43:44,642 --> 00:43:45,802
[SPEAKER_07]: My god, that was a lot of work.

596
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here it is.

597
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:49,304
[SPEAKER_07]: The definitive list.

598
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:52,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Games we would like to see South Park make fun of next.

599
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:55,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And I gotta tell you, this list turned out really freaking weird.

600
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Considering we had so many votes, there were a lot of ties.

601
00:43:59,649 --> 00:44:00,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is.

602
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:05,352
[SPEAKER_07]: The number one game you want to see South Park make fun of was a tie.

603
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:36,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Game number one, Silent Hill And game number two, Katamari Damacy Those games tied for first place Damacy Whatever And now what's interesting is so that takes us to third place And there was also a tie So we have two games tying for third place Because you know, you have first and second place basically tied there So for third place we have Grand Theft Auto San Andreas And Final Fantasy Are the two games that came in third place there

604
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,760
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the definitive list.

605
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys all for voting and giving me a lot of work there during that segment.

606
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:45,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Yikes.

607
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:48,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll see if any of those actually make it to the show.

608
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:50,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can say you heard it here first.

609
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:53,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the Skype line, boys and girls, and take some calls.

610
00:44:55,464 --> 00:44:56,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

611
00:44:56,524 --> 00:44:56,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

612
00:44:57,624 --> 00:44:58,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Raven's Dolphin.

613
00:44:58,584 --> 00:44:59,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my friend.

614
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,005
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

615
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:02,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say one news, Brian.

616
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:04,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

617
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:06,046
[SPEAKER_09]: It's GameFly.

618
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:07,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

619
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,893
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually did some more things with Gamefly.

620
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:13,734
[SPEAKER_09]: They now have four tiers now.

621
00:45:14,935 --> 00:45:15,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Four tiers?

622
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:18,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, now you can get one game for $15.99.

623
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:21,120
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get two games for $21.

624
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, they just added this.

625
00:45:24,442 --> 00:45:31,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Three games for $30, or you can go for the Kin Kaboodle, which you'll lock yourself in your room forever.

626
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Four games for $40.

627
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Netflix does like eight games.

628
00:45:36,454 --> 00:45:38,395
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do like up to eight movies on Netflix.

629
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:41,236
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, at least I think you can.

630
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:42,816
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so I'm not too surprised.

631
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:45,237
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably would let you do more if you really want.

632
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:47,298
[SPEAKER_07]: But damn, what do you need with five games at a time?

633
00:45:47,398 --> 00:45:48,839
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you need with four games at a time?

634
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:49,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Two is enough.

635
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Two is enough so that you have, I mean, even, well, one's really enough.

636
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,741
[SPEAKER_07]: But two is enough so that when one's in the mail, you still have something to play.

637
00:45:56,602 --> 00:45:57,022
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

638
00:45:57,362 --> 00:46:00,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't need more than that, in my opinion, but whatever.

639
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:02,864
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if that's what you, it's your money, spend it how you want.

640
00:46:03,863 --> 00:46:04,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because I'm poor.

641
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:06,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to save up for a week.

642
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:07,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a Gamefly subscriber?

643
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:08,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

644
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:09,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't use them.

645
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:10,168
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of them?

646
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:11,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not because I dislike them or anything.

647
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, at this time, choose not to use them.

648
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:14,492
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of them?

649
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:16,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, they got really better.

650
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:21,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Before, at first, they didn't ship my games for like nine days, and now it's coming to four.

651
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackwolf in our chatroom is commenting, you just had to be a member for a month before you got the third game option.

652
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:31,546
[SPEAKER_07]: They had three games from Gamefly years ago.

653
00:46:31,586 --> 00:46:32,647
[SPEAKER_07]: The four games is new.

654
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:37,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they just gave it to me for 25 cents this month, Black Wolf.

655
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:37,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

656
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:39,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're not nice to me.

657
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:40,922
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

658
00:46:41,903 --> 00:46:43,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

659
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:45,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, one other thing.

660
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:46,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

661
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:48,109
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?

662
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:51,133
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

663
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:51,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I know.

664
00:46:52,094 --> 00:46:52,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

665
00:46:52,574 --> 00:46:55,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought an iPod, so I'm now mad at Apple.

666
00:46:55,678 --> 00:46:55,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

667
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:58,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they just came out with the new Nanos.

668
00:46:59,173 --> 00:47:01,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like a little mini iPod.

669
00:47:01,774 --> 00:47:03,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the ones with the black and white screen?

670
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:03,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

671
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:04,515
[SPEAKER_09]: The iPod Mini?

672
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:05,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

673
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:08,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I got an old Nano, so I'm not mad at them.

674
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:10,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you might... Well, I doubt you could do it.

675
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:16,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Because sometimes if they do a price cut, like a week after you bought it, they'll give you a refund.

676
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,762
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe not with the old models versus new models.

677
00:47:19,842 --> 00:47:20,722
[SPEAKER_07]: But you never know.

678
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:21,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Check their website.

679
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:21,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

680
00:47:22,483 --> 00:47:23,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't tell you.

681
00:47:24,264 --> 00:47:26,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm... And...

682
00:47:26,618 --> 00:47:27,599
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

683
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:28,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, can you guys hear me?

684
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hi, this is Blue Monster from the chat room.

685
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:30,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, what's on your mind?

686
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:30,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

687
00:47:31,502 --> 00:47:31,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

688
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:51,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to share two things.

689
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:56,446
[SPEAKER_10]: The first one is, congrats on the show, man, because seriously, it's something I look forward to every week.

690
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:57,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, I really appreciate that.

691
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,829
[SPEAKER_10]: A constant in your life, you know, as I was telling you earlier, DarkSakura.

692
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:07,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, the second little thing I wanted to share with you guys is, I picked up Okami last week.

693
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's a game I've heard a lot of great things about and seen a lot of good things about.

694
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:15,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little tight on my gaming budget right now, so I haven't been able to pick it up.

695
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:17,697
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I'm really curious.

696
00:48:17,717 --> 00:48:18,537
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of this game?

697
00:48:19,218 --> 00:48:20,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I actually wanted to call.

698
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to give you like a mini-review kind of thing.

699
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,283
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty good game.

700
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:26,183
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty good game.

701
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:31,347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very Zelda-ish, but the only thing I have against it is there's a lot of hand-holding.

702
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:34,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, the first dozen hours, I put all my 24 in it.

703
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,331
[SPEAKER_10]: The first 12 hours is like nothing but hand-holding.

704
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:39,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they tell you everything the way you gotta stop it.

705
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:43,256
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're looking for some hardcore Zelda-ish style of gameplay...

706
00:48:44,459 --> 00:48:48,681
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have a hard time getting through it, at least for the first half.

707
00:48:48,921 --> 00:48:58,024
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Enchanted Arms, which is a game I have been playing lately, is very similar because every time you go into a new dungeon, it seems like there's some new environmental thing.

708
00:48:58,064 --> 00:49:00,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, press A to get into the cart.

709
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Press A to move the teleport.

710
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:05,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll have to have this whole back and forth where the main character is like, how do I do this?

711
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:14,878
[SPEAKER_07]: and one of the other smarter people in the party says, well, you walk up to it and press A. But that's the answer every single time you walk up to it and press A. They could have just said in the beginning.

712
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:27,609
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a little tune that's like jumping up and down the nose of the wolf and he tells you all the time, oh, maybe if I should use my brush to cut this vine, which I've been doing for the past six hours, please let me do it myself.

713
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:35,375
[SPEAKER_07]: They should just have had a thing that says, hey, whenever you see new shit, press A. Exactly, yeah.

714
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:54,044
[SPEAKER_10]: But overall, it's a really good music, really good art style, the graphics are really good, there is a bit of slowdown, because there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen sometimes, but overall, it's a really good game, it seems long, because I've already put 24 hours in it, and the game actually just got started, and the hand-holding just now stopped, so I'm guessing...

715
00:49:54,798 --> 00:49:56,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, long game.

716
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:59,321
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a good game to get if you're waiting for Final Princess, I guess.

717
00:49:59,802 --> 00:50:00,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

718
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:01,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Now one other question I have for you.

719
00:50:01,363 --> 00:50:07,788
[SPEAKER_07]: For those that don't know much about Okami, I mean, maybe we've seen the graphics, you know, that it has that very unique hand-drawn style to it.

720
00:50:08,188 --> 00:50:10,370
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you compare this game to?

721
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:17,275
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could compare it to any other game, you know, maybe half this and half this, what would you say it's kind of like for people that want to know if they'd be interested in this or not?

722
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:28,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Mix the world of Wind Waker and the style, cartoony style of Wind Waker, but also add a bit of a stench of Chester Radio or Chester Radio Future and maybe some beautiful Joe in it.

723
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:29,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

724
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:30,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

725
00:50:30,848 --> 00:50:34,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And all those games kind of have that same art style too, so that's kind of interesting.

726
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:39,813
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing is that Wind Waker is very clean looking, this is more dirty.

727
00:50:40,714 --> 00:50:45,438
[SPEAKER_10]: The graphics are not that clean because of the brush thing and the whole brush theme that it has.

728
00:50:45,898 --> 00:50:48,520
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's more beautiful Joe-ish, but it's still really good.

729
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,743
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very Japanese, so you've got to be open-minded about it.

730
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:56,287
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a really good game, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's stuck on the game.

731
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:57,688
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't be scared.

732
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,391
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as platformer as it seems to be.

733
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:03,773
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more adventure-ish and more pilot-ish, I guess.

734
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm calling from Argentina, it's 1am in the morning over here What's it like in Argentina?

735
00:51:27,476 --> 00:51:28,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing.

736
00:51:29,058 --> 00:51:39,371
[SPEAKER_10]: You pay about 80 US dollars for a game, between 70 or 80, if you want the original copy, of course, because there's a black market here, like, you wouldn't believe, like, you can buy a game for 2 bucks if you want to, US.

737
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:39,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

738
00:51:40,253 --> 00:51:44,318
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, but if you actually want an original game, you gotta pay about 70, 80 bucks.

739
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:48,290
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's all games because you don't get the new stuff right away.

740
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:56,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And you got to take into account that a maid here, like a maid full-time maid here, maybe costs 200 US dollars a month.

741
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:57,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

742
00:51:58,476 --> 00:51:59,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

743
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:00,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

744
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:04,540
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like basically a game is about half the salary of a maid per month.

745
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh.

746
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, now your copy of Okami is legit though, right?

747
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:09,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no, really.

748
00:52:10,113 --> 00:52:11,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, uh-oh.

749
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:16,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we better hurry and end this call.

750
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:18,240
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't tell on you.

751
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:20,182
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't give out your full name or anything.

752
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:21,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you got to call in, though.

753
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:22,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

754
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:24,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm glad I got to call in.

[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

00:52:26,628 --> 00:52:30,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, have fun with the game, and we know that when you can't afford it, you will buy the legit copy.

757
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I already put it up there, so, you know.

758

[SPEAKER_07]: We love hearing from people.

768
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:50,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't say overseas, but over planet, because, you know, you're all the way down there right now.

769
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I just gotta keep looking south.

770
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:52,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

771
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,071
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Math's going, happy ending.

772
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:57,972
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, is that I'm in massage therapy school, so I know what you mean.

773
00:52:58,232 --> 00:52:59,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

774
00:52:59,073 --> 00:52:59,473
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys...

775
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:01,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Go play Uno.

776
00:53:01,224 --> 00:53:02,845
[SPEAKER_07]: They cover that in massage therapy school?

777
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:03,486
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't.

778
00:53:04,146 --> 00:53:05,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't started school yet, though.

779
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:06,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Go play Uno, you sick fucks.

780
00:53:06,887 --> 00:53:07,207
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

781
00:53:08,028 --> 00:53:08,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

782
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:09,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

783
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:10,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, this is Eddie.

784
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Eddie.

785
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,350
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

786
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:23,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just wondering if you heard about that thing, like a guy posted on the All Games forums that he was booted out of Uno because somebody saw that he was a black guy.

787
00:53:25,427 --> 00:53:27,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I did read that post.

788
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:28,409
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so fucked up.

789
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:29,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I did read that post.

790
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, somebody... Oh, that sucks.

791
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:33,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I know about this.

792
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:33,992
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

793
00:53:34,192 --> 00:53:35,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

794
00:53:36,193 --> 00:53:37,934
[SPEAKER_07]: God, can we find the post real quick?

795
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:40,496
[SPEAKER_07]: This just made me so angry.

796
00:53:42,077 --> 00:53:43,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are so stupid.

797
00:53:44,518 --> 00:53:45,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Swear to God.

798
00:53:45,419 --> 00:53:46,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if I can find it.

799
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:47,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember what forum it was in?

800
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:49,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the...

801
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:55,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you real quick, while I hunt for the post, is there any other topics you want to bring up tonight?

802
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:01,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had something related to that thing.

803
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:11,275
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the replies to the article was that that's why the me on the we thing is so good, because you can create your own avatar or whatever.

804
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:16,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just thinking that it doesn't really solve the racism issue, since...

805
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:18,272
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

806
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,309
[SPEAKER_07]: and it shouldn't matter.

807
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,290
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't matter at all.

808
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:38,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, in World of Warcraft, we play purple and green people and it doesn't matter, you know?

809
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:39,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

810
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:45,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, when they demoed the Wii, they showed them making Samuel L. Jackson the baddest motherfucker on the planet.

811
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:51,066
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I would cower in fear if I was playing against Samuel L. Jackson, you know, because...

812
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:55,599
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a badass, but people are just so superficial.

813
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:56,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I found the post.

814
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:57,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

815
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize probably like 50 of you linked it in chat room, but I did find it on my own.

816
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:01,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

817
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:02,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

818
00:55:02,387 --> 00:55:03,528
[SPEAKER_07]: This was made by a post.

819
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:09,895
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy is named Five Fingers of Death, and this is on allgames.com's forums in the Xbox 360 section.

820
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:12,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Does Vision Cam hamper jump in Vision of Live?

821
00:55:12,862 --> 00:55:41,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this I purchased my vision cam last week and hooked it up to experience a couple of multiplayer UNO sessions when I connected all three people I was paired with also had the camera I heard someone mention he's a black guy and then I was booted by the host as we know live has always had its racist comments but for the most part you could never really tell who you were gaming with for all we know David Duke could be playing with Louis Farrakhan and neither would be the wiser now being able to actually see the person how will this affect the live community just wondering

822
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:46,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I can't wait for me to get on the camera and have somebody go, That guy looks like a fag.

823
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:47,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Boot him.

824
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:50,545
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't want to play with those fuckers anyway.

825
00:55:50,665 --> 00:55:53,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's fucked up.

826
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:54,447
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

827
00:55:55,008 --> 00:55:58,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Put all those people on your ban list and warn them and damage them the best you can.

828
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,410
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so stupid.

829
00:56:02,211 --> 00:56:05,933
[SPEAKER_07]: They obviously don't want to play a good game, good old-fashioned game of Uno anyway.

830
00:56:06,213 --> 00:56:08,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it doesn't make it right at all.

831
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:11,416
[SPEAKER_07]: By any means does it make it right, but I guess...

832
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:17,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Until, you know, Microsoft steps in and I don't even know what Microsoft can do.

833
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:18,333
[SPEAKER_07]: What can they do?

834
00:56:19,373 --> 00:56:19,714
Ban.

835
00:56:20,314 --> 00:56:22,676
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's up to the community to police itself, I suppose.

836
00:56:23,616 --> 00:56:23,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

837
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Disturbing.

838
00:56:26,738 --> 00:56:27,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you wanted to say on that?

839
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not on that issue, but take pictures of cookie box.

840
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:35,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

841
00:56:35,584 --> 00:56:35,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

842
00:56:35,924 --> 00:56:39,526
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get them from Granville Island, one of my favorite places in Vancouver.

843
00:56:39,686 --> 00:56:40,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

844
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:41,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

845
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:41,528
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

846
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:42,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, buddy.

847
00:56:42,628 --> 00:56:44,509
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

848
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:16,672
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what I was training with the Marines, they were showing us the tapes of famous Marines on the tape.

849
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:18,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

850
00:57:19,152 --> 00:57:23,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, you know, I'm not going to say you're a liar.

851
00:57:23,293 --> 00:57:24,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I just always thought that was an urban legend.

852
00:57:24,793 --> 00:57:25,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't think that was true.

853
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:28,254
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first time I ever heard it when I saw the tape.

854
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:32,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think I remember my brother telling me something about that.

855
00:57:32,275 --> 00:57:35,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, me and my brother actually just was released from the Marines.

856
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Firebomba says, WTF, Mr. Rogers is a camper.

857
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:41,225
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

858
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you know what?

859
00:58:04,641 --> 00:58:07,543
[SPEAKER_07]: On Wikipedia, that whole thing is filed under urban legends.

860
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:08,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what it says.

861
00:58:08,424 --> 00:58:08,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yikes.

862
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:30,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's it.

863
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to give your Wikipedia to your friend.

864
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:36,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But he also was a Presbyterian minister and left the clergy to work with children.

865
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:36,988
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

866
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:43,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I just realized podcast listeners may not understand why we're suddenly talking about Mr. Rogers.

867
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:50,951
[SPEAKER_07]: We do a bonus segment when we tape live when we'll sometimes play things off of YouTube and such and that was the subject this week was Mr. Rogers.

868
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:54,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, just for the podcast people's sake who maybe didn't hear that live.

869
00:58:55,492 --> 00:58:56,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, anything else on your mind, Ranma?

870
00:58:57,455 --> 00:58:59,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I've decided not to buy a PlayStation 3.

871
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:00,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is this?

872
00:59:01,196 --> 00:59:07,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching, I was following like the Sony's podcast, livecast of the PSN and everything.

873
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:09,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're doing their version of the virtual console.

874
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,960
[SPEAKER_04]: On that fact alone, I refuse to buy one.

875
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:16,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, is it because you feel they're ripping them off or something?

876
00:59:17,543 --> 00:59:18,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean...

877
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:28,219
[SPEAKER_04]: They say imitation is the greatest form for flattery, but come on Sony's been ripping off people left and right with the PS3 But couldn't you say that the Virtual Console is a form of Xbox Live Arcade?

878
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and no, but the thing is the Virtual Console has all these classic games by Nintendo

879
00:59:35,066 --> 00:59:36,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live Arcade Xbox Live Arcade Xbox Live Arcade

880
01:00:03,925 --> 01:00:04,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

881
01:00:05,866 --> 01:00:07,366
[SPEAKER_07]: But to not buy a system over it?

882
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:09,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what if they did it better?

883
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:13,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, I just can't see myself, you know.

884
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:15,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, Zarko, I'm not a fanboy.

885
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:16,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have 600 bucks.

886
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:21,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's the realistic reason why none of us are getting a PS3 at launch.

887
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,373
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I think I can speak... Well, I don't know.

888
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:24,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Jamie's getting one.

889
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:26,274
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know I can't afford 600 bucks.

890
01:00:26,654 --> 01:00:28,715
[SPEAKER_04]: For 600 bucks, it better come with a lap dance.

891
01:00:28,935 --> 01:00:30,076
[SPEAKER_07]: For 600 bucks, it better...

892
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:32,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Suck... Never mind.

893
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:33,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to finish that thought.

894
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:34,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

895
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:35,273
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm thinking.

896
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:36,093
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm thinking.

897
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anything else on your mind, Ranma?

898
01:00:40,456 --> 01:00:40,796
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

899
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:41,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys.

900
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:43,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you too.

901
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:43,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

902
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:44,998
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next month.

903
01:00:45,078 --> 01:00:45,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, bye.

904
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:46,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

905
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:47,499
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

906
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:51,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming to Orange... I'm coming to New York City very soon.

907
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:53,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll have details on where I'm going to be and when.

908
01:00:54,203 --> 01:00:54,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully soon.

909
01:00:55,529 --> 01:01:01,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel weird because now I think there's at least more than a handful of people that want to come meet up, so I feel weird about doing that at a store unannounced.

910
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:04,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to figure something out creative we can do.

911
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:04,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

912
01:01:05,137 --> 01:01:06,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to work with some people in New York.

913
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:07,759
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun, though.

914
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, are there any other last-minute stories that any of you guys have?

915
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:15,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys, by the way, all of you guys that called in tonight.

916
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:17,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And sorry to those we didn't get to.

917
01:01:17,146 --> 01:01:19,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just running out low on time.

918
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:22,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

919
01:01:22,931 --> 01:01:23,111
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

920
01:01:23,737 --> 01:01:32,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one quick story I wanted to share here from BamaniStyle.com has posted a list of elite beat agents, a song list, at least partial.

921
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:39,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, again, because apparently it's being shown off on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, and they were able to get some of the songs from the game.

922
01:01:40,883 --> 01:01:53,188
[SPEAKER_07]: YMCA by Village People, Highway Star by Deep Purple, Rock This Town by Stray Cats, Walkie Talkie Man by Stereogram, Makes No Difference by Sum 41, September by Earth, Wind & Fire, Skater Boy by Avril Lavigne,

923
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:55,168
[SPEAKER_07]: and I Was Born to Love You by Queen.

924
01:01:56,368 --> 01:01:56,769
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

925
01:01:57,729 --> 01:02:01,391
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to check out what stages those are related to, check out BomaniStyle.com.

926
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a more complete list over there.

927
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:07,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And on that note, I guess we're going to end the show.

928
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:10,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

929
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:12,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

930
01:02:12,336 --> 01:02:14,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

931
01:02:14,557 --> 01:02:15,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran out of milkshake.

932
01:02:16,919 --> 01:02:17,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to hear that.

933
01:02:18,674 --> 01:02:26,678
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought would be I need to adjust the sound on my new TV because it sounds like I'm playing Beatmania in a tin can and that's not fun.

934
01:02:27,558 --> 01:02:28,599
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

935
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:29,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject false icons.

936
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:32,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And Julie's meeting us for dinner.

937
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:33,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

938
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:35,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I need some dinner.

939
01:02:35,081 --> 01:02:36,902
[SPEAKER_02]: She has my house keys because she had to feed my cat.

940
01:02:37,342 --> 01:02:39,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I need some big time dinner action.

941
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:41,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So to do that, we have to finish the show.

942
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:42,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night, everybody.

943
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:47,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for supporting independent internet radio even when the hosts stutter.

944
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:51,654
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
