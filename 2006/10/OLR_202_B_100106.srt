5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,540
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,920
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 202 for this October

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,280
1st of 2006.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,160
I can't believe the year is almost over at this point.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,160
It's crazy.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
Seriously.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Time just flies by.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,640
Loki, why don't you start us off.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,960
Yes, let's start us off with the Zune.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
The Zune, it sounds like Lune.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,320
But anyways, Microsoft's brand new MP3 movie, you name it, player.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,960
They announced some details at X06 about how exactly it's going to work and some of the

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
online things.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,120
The 30GB version of the Zune will be sold for $249.99 when they're on sale November

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,920
14th in the United States.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,760
The price of music is in two choices.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
You can either buy a monthly pass for 99 cents, which will give you hearing access to all

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,040
these songs in the Zune marketplace.

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
But there is a catch.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,360
You will not be able to listen to the songs once the pass has expired.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,200
If you want to permanently buy any song, you can make it yours by spending 79 Microsoft

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
points.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
That's right.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,880
The same Microsoft points you would be buying Doom on Xbox Live Arcade, you can be spending

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
on music.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,320
And of course, 79 points is roughly about 99 cents.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,440
So you can either purchase the song for 99 cents or you can pay, I guess, a monthly fee

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,360
and listen to all the music for 99 cents.

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
But you probably have to download it each time.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
So it's kind of interesting.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,740
Kind of an interesting way to conduct business.

37
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,920
Pretty soon I'll be paying my rent in Microsoft points.

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,080
Kind of sad.

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,040
That honestly is a bit on the sad side.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,480
I honestly, you know, I've had this sort of image though that the way the future is going

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,160
to go is going to use some sort of electronic.

42
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,480
We're already on credit cards, you know.

43
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
We can buy things online.

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,920
Man, debit and all that stuff, we're practically there.

45
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,840
It'll be like Demolition Man where they scan the barcode in our hand and we have credits

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
and if you cuss...

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I hope not because that was kind of a crap movie.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Well, actually, ironically enough...

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
I love that movie.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,600
I was watching this thing on the Discovery Channel.

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
They were talking about Wired.

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,800
It's like they have Next Fest or something like that where they're showing off, you know,

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
brand new technology.

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
Kind of like, I guess, CES or something like that.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,480
But anyways, one of the technologies that they were showing off was a thumbprint scanner.

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,360
It's basically a thumbprint scanner and then you enter in your phone number and you'll

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,860
deduct, you know, money from your checking or savings account just using your thumbprint.

58
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,200
So that's pretty much going to be like the wave of the future.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,480
We also have this thing where they have a chip stored in a fake tooth that's fireproof,

60
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,140
you know, bashproof pretty much.

61
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,900
So that if you were to be horribly, say, horribly burned in a fire, they can still identify

62
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,500
your remains without DNA testing.

63
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,240
You've got your tooth there with your medical records and all your information.

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,400
Without having to play, let's name the burn victim!

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
Well, to get back into gaming news...

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Yes, please.

67
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,720
Now, keep in mind, I was a big tech TV fangirl.

68
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,320
For fans of Saint's Row, there is a thing called the Thunky Fresh Pack, yeah.

69
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,960
It's 100 Microsoft points and it has clothes, tattoos, hairstyles.

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,120
For use in single and multiplayer modes, you've also got tiger striped underwear, bunny slippers,

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,560
an eye patch, and a samurai helmet, medallions, and rattlesnake tattoos.

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,820
Gee, do I spend the 100 points to buy this crap or should I get a copy of London Bridge

73
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,820
for my Zune?

74
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,840
I just don't know.

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
I think...

76
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,600
Some people like the customization.

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,240
And some people like Fergie.

78
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,120
Oh my god, I had to listen to that CD yesterday.

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,600
My character has a pimp hat now and his dress is in really nice clothes.

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,960
All purple, of course, because I've got to represent Saint's Row colors in order to get

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:15,080
the more, I guess, points for missions and stuff.

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,240
This was kind of like the same thing we were talking about a while back, which was rumored

83
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,720
to be coming to the kiosk at GameStop for free.

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,200
I wish it was coming to the GameStop kiosk for free because I'd rather pick it up there.

85
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Who knows?

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Maybe it still will.

87
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I hope so.

88
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Some of them pay for this.

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,440
Well, I like free things and Midway is giving away some free things right now, namely some

90
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,800
online Flash playable copies of some of their arcade treasures.

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,560
You can play Bubbles, Defender 1 and 2, Joust, Rampage, Robotron 2084, which is Microsoft

92
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,000
Points on Xbox 360, Satan's Hollow, Sinistar, Spy Hunter, and Tapper.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,160
Yes, you can play those all online on Midway's website.

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,760
Right now, if you want, it's MidwayArcade.com.

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
So who needs Midway arcade treasures, huh?

96
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,320
You got all that available for you.

97
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Enjoy.

98
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Exactly.

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
And you know what?

100
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,520
You've got to save money for those PlayStation 3 games, of course.

101
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,920
And as we mentioned earlier, they are going to be retailing for about $59.99 for the most

102
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,940
part, which is expected.

103
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:26,960
Most current gen games are peaking out about $49.99, most actually which are $39.99 now.

104
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,060
And now the next gen games are going to try to be getting $59.99 retail for most everything.

105
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:43,520
This is pretty much confirmed by sites like Sony style and whatnot.

106
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,240
Some games might not be $59.99 like Gran Turismo HD.

107
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,640
It's not a surprise, I would say.

108
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,800
But I'm still waiting for those companies out there to get greedy and start charging

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
more.

110
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
As long as those $70 and $80 rumors don't come true.

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,760
To be honest, though, I don't think they are because if anything, they'll try to nickel

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,960
and dime you on the backend with their online content.

113
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,080
That's what it's going to end up being.

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,320
Instead of charging $70, they can charge $900 and charge $50 for the game or something.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Alright.

116
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Jamie.

117
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
What?

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Jamie.

119
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
What?

120
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Jamie.

121
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Jamie.

122
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Bob.

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Jamie.

124
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Bob.

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Bob.

126
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Bob.

127
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Bob.

128
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Okay.

129
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
So we got Kayla.

130
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:40,020
Kayla WWE,

131
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:48,020
On the sixth, we have Barnyard for a bunch of stuff.

132
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,020
We have Capcom Puzzle World on PSP.

133
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Heroes of Annihilated Empires on the PC.

134
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Import Tuner Challenge on Xbox 360.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Mage Knight Apocalypse on PC.

136
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,020
The Nintendo DS browser on the PSP.

137
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,020
I'm sorry, the DS.

138
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,020
That was a bad joke.

139
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Wah wah.

140
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,020
Open Season coming out on damn near everything.

141
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,020
Put out by Ubisoft.

142
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
Wild Arms 4 on PlayStation 2.

143
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,020
I have to say the Wild Arms series is a good game.

144
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,020
I have a friend who is absolutely addicted to that game.

145
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,020
Wild Arms 4 is good.

146
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Did Wild Arms Ultra F ever come out over there?

147
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,020
Not a series I played.

148
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Hey guys, let me know if it ever came out.

149
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,020
A few things coming up though in the month to look forward to is Power Stone collection for PSP.

150
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,020
English training, have fun improving your skills on the DS.

151
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,020
That's actually pretty funny.

152
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,020
Resident Evil 4 Platinum, Sims 2 Pets coming out.

153
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:55,020
They're getting Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Budokai 2 and Metal Slug Anthology.

154
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
That's pretty cool.

155
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,020
The US isn't going to see too much this week.

156
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,020
There are some pretty good games there.

157
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,020
FIFA Soccer 07 if you're a soccer fan coming out in almost every single system.

158
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,020
You do have also Star Trek Encounters coming out on the PlayStation 2.

159
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,020
A great Star Trek combat game.

160
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,020
Very cheap, $19.99.

161
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,020
So check it out if you can.

162
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,020
I think actually it might even be $14.99.

163
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
I know it's very cheap, but that's all I know.

164
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Anyways, another crappy game, Snow Cross 2 featuring Air Blur Morgan.

165
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,020
And by the way, this game has been delayed for a year, so it's crap.

166
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,020
Let's see, Mercury Meltdown for the PSP, which is equal for the first Mercury game.

167
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,020
And I don't know if this is worth your money, but if you want, pick it up.

168
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,020
Gangs of London, definitely a better game for the PSP.

169
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Also on the PC we have El Matador and Paparazzi.

170
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,020
So that's some interesting stuff.

171
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,020
How could I not forget Scarface, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

172
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,020
Now a lot of places are reporting that this is the 8th of October, but it's actually the 5th.

173
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,020
It has a soft street date on it, so stores will be getting it on the 5th, but they cannot advertise it until the 8th.

174
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,020
So weird.

175
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Go bug your GameStops, because that's probably the game you're going to want that week.

176
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,020
Alright, well over in Japan we have some release dates for the week.

177
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Honestly, not a whole lot coming out this week.

178
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,020
It's kind of a slow week over there as well.

179
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,020
NBA Live 07 and FIFA Soccer 07 both coming out this week.

180
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:41,020
Shinobido Imashime, also known as Spike the Best, is coming out over there this week as well.

181
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,020
And Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is coming out this week.

182
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,020
Front Mission 5 in the Ultimate Hits Collection, hit stores this week in Japan as well.

183
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:58,020
And for you music game fans who have about $250 to spare, you can get your Guitar Freaks ASC arcade-style controller this week.

184
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
That's awesome.

185
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:11,020
Well, as far as other releases for the UK going back to them, they're actually, for fans who are football nuts,

186
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:20,020
there's Pro Evolution Soccer 6 coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC on 27th October, of course out by Konami.

187
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,020
PSP and DS versions will be coming.

188
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:34,020
They're actually stating that the 360 version is going to be noticeably improved.

189
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:44,020
The AI anyway is. They actually specifically named it in areas like the AI players running into space.

190
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
That's not going to happen.

191
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,020
It also runs in high definition and widescreen.

192
00:10:48,020 --> 00:11:01,020
It will also feature new licensed clubs, including Manchester United, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, and Olympiasos.

193
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:11,020
New kits and squads for Czech, French, Australian, English, Italian, Argentinian, Spanish, and Swedish National.

194
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,020
I know we've got some football fans listening.

195
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:25,020
Some other things you might be able to look forward to on the next-gen consoles, other than football, would be Castlevania.

196
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:33,020
More Castlevania games are on the way, including more 2D Castlevania games, Promises, Koji, and Higurashi.

197
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Now, of course, Xbox Live Arcade will be seeing Symphony of the Night at some point, as they've announced previously,

198
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:48,020
but we might see even maybe the original Castlevania, Simon's Quest, 3, who knows?

199
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:59,020
From the sounds of it, he says, I hope more people will enjoy 2D Castlevania experience as a result of it, talking about the three systems succeeding.

200
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,020
He thinks all three of them are going to do well.

201
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:12,020
Basically, he's up for doing more 2D Castlevania, so maybe we'll see some exclusive stuff on the next-gen marketplaces.

202
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:20,020
Please, some more 2D Castlevania, or you can do that subtle hints of 3D, kind of like if you look at Symphony of the Night.

203
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:26,020
Just make a real grand 2D Castlevania for the next-gen. It would be awesome.

204
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Just because you're next-gen doesn't mean everything has to be 3D.

205
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:35,020
Look at a game like Viewtiful Joe. It was a great 2D using next-gen graphics.

206
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,020
Anyway, if you still want to live in the current generation, well, this might be the controller for you.

207
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,020
This is a controller that would be great for throwing against the wall.

208
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Everybody has a friend like this, somebody who gets so frustrated, or maybe a sibling, that they throw the controller against the wall,

209
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,020
or they throw it at people when they get really frustrated with the game.

210
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,020
Well, now you have a Nerf controller.

211
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,020
That's right, there's a PlayStation 2 controller that's covered in Nerf.

212
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:07,020
It's like this bluish color here, and it's coming out for the PlayStation 2, and it's wireless.

213
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:13,020
It comes in black, blue, red, or orange. It'll be about $30, and comes out in November of 2006.

214
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,020
That's right, the official Nerf controller, perfect for throwing around, although I wouldn't recommend it.

215
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,020
You could still break the damn thing.

216
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,020
Or somebody.

217
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,020
It's still kind of heavy. Just because it's Nerf-made doesn't mean it's safe to chuck at people's heads, but it at least would hurt a lot less.

218
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:38,020
Speaking about breaking people, there was the Uwe Boll boxing matches going on recently, and as expected, you know,

219
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,020
nothing's going to be fair when it comes down to Uwe Boll.

220
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:51,020
In fact, Richard Lotak-Kanka was one of the people from Something Awful to actually be able to fight in this,

221
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:57,020
and he kind of gave a little bit of a background to these whole boxing matches.

222
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:04,020
Apparently, they were supposed to be a PR stunt, which is, you know, pretty obvious, and all the punches were supposed to be kind of fake.

223
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,020
Also, that they were supposed to be given training.

224
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,020
So it was supposed to be like wrestling.

225
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Pretty much. And it was supposed to be, you know, they were supposed to be given training beforehand.

226
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:22,020
So, you know, there were going to be five contenders, but apparently one of them had to be pulled out of the competition

227
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,020
because he had a boxing background, and Uwe Boll wasn't like a fair fight.

228
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:36,020
So out of the four people, including one 17-year-old, everyone, you know, pretty much got beat the crap out of.

229
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,020
Is that legal, to beat the crap out of a 17-year-old like that?

230
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,020
Well, I guess it was Canada. Maybe the laws are different there. I don't know.

231
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,020
I guess he signed a waiver. Maybe the parents signed a waiver as well.

232
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,020
Video's out there on YouTube, so check it out.

233
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:58,020
To be honest, I don't know, you know, Richard Lotax, or Lotax from Something Awful,

234
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:04,020
his whole thing is, you know, he didn't really hate Uwe Boll before this whole thing, and now he does.

235
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,020
He thinks he's a douche, basically.

236
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Wonder Dog Harold sums it up in our chat room and says, Uwe Boll is such a pig fucker.

237
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,020
It doesn't matter. Okay, big deal. So you beat up some critics.

238
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Ooh, you beat up critics that had no boxing training, and one person that actually might give you some competition,

239
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
you pussied out, you fucker.

240
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Didn't one of the critics that came out of this say that, you know, although the fight was kind of a joke,

241
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,020
the new movie's not bad, or something like the clips they saw from the new movie didn't seem that bad?

242
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:37,020
I don't see how they can mess up, you know, Postal. I mean, that one I'm interested in seeing, actually.

243
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,020
But I think the new movie, In the Name of the King or whatever, that's going to suck donkey balls.

244
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,020
And know what's even worse about it? It's two fucking parts, so it's like four hours long.

245
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,020
No, thank you. I will not be seeing your two crappy-ass halves of movies.

246
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,020
You know what I would pay to see?

247
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
What?

248
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Jack Thompson versus Uwe Boll. Seriously, to death.

249
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Why isn't Jack Thompson coming after him for beating up on 17-year-olds?

250
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Because he's too busy trying to involve himself by, oh, God, Roboy linked me to this article.

251
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:13,020
He's aligning himself with the defense for some cases. It's just a bunch of bullshit.

252
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Well, you'll notice I purposely omitted that from tonight's show role because I didn't want to give him any more attention.

253
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Sorry.

254
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Well, the one thing that I think is worth mentioning for this is that it's probably something to lightly get him disbarred in that state, so let's hope that happens.

255
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Hooray.

256
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Well, God, all this talk of Uwe Boll and Jack Thompson puts me in a foul mood, so you know what that means, right, Dark Sakura?

257
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:43,020
Hmm.

258
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
The FUs of the week, Dark Sakura.

259
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,020
My FU of the week goes primarily, there are some exceptions, to straight men.

260
00:16:51,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Oh, yes. Just because I'm a woman doesn't give you the right to look at me, see me there, and then proceed to back into me and elbow me in the shoulder while trying to take a picture at the wax museum.

261
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,020
And then it doesn't give you permission to just expect me to move out of the way when you're going to open a door.

262
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:16,020
I paid to be there. You are going to freaking respect my personal space. Fuck you and your cock.

263
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,020
But not literally.

264
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
No.

265
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:25,020
It goes to this whole attitude of, I'm a man, you're a woman, you have to move, you have to do what I say, blah, blah, blah.

266
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Fuck you.

267
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

268
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
You know what?

269
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,020
The whole, I hate how, I hope you're not, this isn't towards you.

270
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,020
Well, I'm just saying, how did you know his sexual orientation?

271
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,020
His wife was there.

272
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Does that mean anything?

273
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Trust me.

274
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,020
I have infallible gay dark.

275
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:58,020
These people, the only way that I think that there would be any remotely gay vibe coming from them is if they were like, you know, bare leather daddies or something.

276
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Which I saw plenty of today.

277
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
But no.

278
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,020
All our listeners of the show are accepted from this, fuck you, right?

279
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Yeah.

280
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Yes, yes.

281
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,020
But I hate, especially, I hate the whole, the flock of testosterone.

282
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
You know what I mean?

283
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:26,020
When you get, like, I guess the football man where it's like, we're going to drink beer and go hooters.

284
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,020
We're going to, to quote Margaret Cho, we're going to order titties with wet dressing and celery sticks.

285
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,020
That's just, okay.

286
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
All right.

287
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
No, no, no.

288
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:47,020
Like I said, this is not centered toward all straight men, this is just centered toward stupid straight men.

289
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,020
All right, Loki, speaking of stupid straight men, Loki, you know how they actually serve Hooters at Hooter?

290
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,020
That might be worth, you know, the price of admission right there, but not their food size.

291
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:07,020
You know, actually, ironically enough, fuck you to stupid women drivers who can't fucking pay attention on the road because you're talking to your kids or talking on the cell phone or fucking around with something on your dash.

292
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,020
You know, I know I understand that those complex SUVs that you drive are so, you know, beyond you.

293
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:21,020
But, you know, could you do us all a favor and stay at home so I don't have to bother, you know, driving behind you because you're too fucking slow or retarded?

294
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Thank you.

295
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:30,020
You have to remember we have, we have folks all around the world listening and not everyone knows what Hooters is.

296
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:39,020
Hooters is this, um, eatery where you can order hot wings and that's about all that's decent on the menu and they're not even very good because they taste like vinegar.

297
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:45,020
And they're served by women, um, wearing really small gym shorts.

298
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,020
Cheerleader outfits, essentially.

299
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,020
Not quite, because they're not little skirts, they're just those uber, they're the shorts that you can see ass cheeks through.

300
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:59,020
And, and actually I read an article about a girl who went inside on, on Hooters just to try to find out what went on behind the scenes.

301
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,020
They give you, they ask you what your t-shirt size is and they give you one that's two sizes too small.

302
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
Lovely.

303
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,020
And basically you're there for boobs.

304
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,020
Which I have no problem with personally, but I hate the whole mentality that spawned it.

305
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,020
And a question from our chat room from someone from abroad who doesn't know better, uh, is there a male version?

306
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,020
There should be.

307
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:28,020
When I was in high school, one of my people who was in band with me that I used to march next to, she said that they should open a restaurant called Pecker's.

308
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,020
Where it's men in Speedos that wear their aprons backwards.

309
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,020
Did you have any other FUs?

310
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Uh, just actually the Hooters, this is kind of a, you know, an old FU, but FU the Hooters because their service does suck.

311
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,020
I mean, you might go there saying, oh yeah, we're gonna go get served by, you know, hot chicks.

312
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:55,020
The chicks are dumb and the service is awful and they can't get anything right and it took them like two hours to serve like hot wings.

313
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,020
Which is their staple food at this goddamn place and they can't prepare that even quick enough.

314
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:05,020
Then they, you know, jump around and dance and stuff and just act obnoxious and annoying the whole time.

315
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,020
It's obviously not worth the trip, so go to a strip club if you really want to eat with boobs around you. Seriously.

316
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,020
What was that one strip club that you said had really good food?

317
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
I think it was Centerfolds.

318
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
Do you wanna go?

319
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Sure, why not? It'll be fun.

320
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Well, Nellie will want to go. Alright, we'll all go. We'll be at OLR. We'll have a staff meeting at Centerfolds. That'll be fun.

321
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
That'll be excellent.

322
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Alright, we'll do that. Our next OLR staff meeting at the titty bar.

323
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:37,020
Um, let's see, um, my FU of the week goes to Philips, the company that made my last television.

324
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,020
Just over one year after buying the thing, we stopped working.

325
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:49,020
You would turn on the TV, my nice new high-definition TV, you turn it on, then the image would get really bright and then it would shut off.

326
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
And it broke. The damn TV broke.

327
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,020
But thank you to Costco, who's now my favorite store ever. They have the best return policy in the world.

328
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,020
I took the TV back and got a new TV from a different company that hopefully will work for more than a year.

329
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Did it have the red eye of death on it? Like that 360?

330
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:11,020
No, it did not have the three rings of death on it. It just, it would come up, it would shut off and then that little flashing green light would come on.

331
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Flash, flash, flash, and that's all it would do.

332
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,020
So I'm tempting you, I have power, but I'm not going to work.

333
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,020
Bobby's offering to fly out here for the staff meeting.

334
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
You are more than welcome to attend.

335
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,020
We can talk about all games business as well at the meeting.

336
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
That would be pretty funny.

337
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,020
You know, that just sounds like it would be lots of fun.

338
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
It is fun.

339
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Strippers are nice people. One of my roommates from, actually ex-roommates from college, well, suitemates, she was a stripper.

340
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,020
You know, it is funny, like, you know, people go, but Sky, you're gay, how can you enjoy the titty bar?

341
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,020
Look, the same reason my straight friends end up enjoying the gay bar every time I take them.

342
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,020
You know, I have very few straight friends who complain about the gay bar.

343
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,020
I think it's only fair if I'm, if they're going to go there, I should go to the titty bar.

344
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,020
And it's funny, it's fun.

345
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,020
I complain about the excessive amount of karaoke that's about it.

346
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,020
And I would have to agree though with SSJ100, Matt, I think that was who said it.

347
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Boobs are a lot more sanitary than cock.

348
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Alright, well, we are going back into the news now, and this has absolutely nothing to do...

349
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,020
We're made an adult this time around.

350
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,020
This absolutely has nothing to do with titties, but it is a little foul.

351
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,020
If you ever watch South Park, you know, it's a little bit dirty, but in that way that we all love.

352
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Well, it looks like on South Park's season premiere, they're going to be spoofing World of Warcraft.

353
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:37,020
And a little 15-second teaser hit the internet this week, and it says the World of Warcraft,

354
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,020
shows the World of Warcraft, and then we hear that all too familiar voice.

355
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Alright, this is it!

356
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,020
I need to play World of Warcraft!

357
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

358
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
Killed faster!

359
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,020
Yes, that's right, this Wednesday on Comedy Central, that should be interesting.

360
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,020
World of Warcraft is going to be hitting South Park.

361
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,020
Yeah, you know, I enjoy South Park.

362
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
I've seen quite a few episodes.

363
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,020
It's one of my guilty pleasures, and I'm sure it's going to be hilarious.

364
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,020
You know, they've spoofed games before.

365
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:15,020
They've spoofed DDR, and they've spoofed the golden PSP.

366
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
Remember that whole episode with the Terry Schiavo thing?

367
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
Yeah.

368
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Yeah, so they've spoofed stuff before.

369
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:25,020
So we thought it would be fun to bring back an old favorite segment of ours tonight,

370
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
and have a little fun with this topic.

371
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,020
We're going to play Listless.

372
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:36,020
Alright, the way Listless works is that we're going to come up with the definitive list

373
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,020
of Orange Lounge Radio's top something with whatever category we're doing tonight.

374
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,020
And as a follow-up to this story, the category we're going to do tonight is

375
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,020
game that South Park most needs to make fun of.

376
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Now obviously we can't do World of Warcraft, and we can't do DDR.

377
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Here's the way Listless works.

378
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,020
All of the hosts are going to go around and name their top three,

379
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,020
and then we're going to go around and eliminate one off the list,

380
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
so it gets a little vicious in here.

381
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
Now usually this game is played with four people,

382
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
but since there's only three of us here in studio,

383
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,020
we've asked one of our frequent callers and emailers to join us tonight.

384
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
Caller, are you there?

385
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
Uh, no.

386
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
I guess you must be, smartass.

387
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
What's your name? Introduce yourself.

388
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
DMN.

389
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
Hello, DMN. How you doing?

390
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
I'm doing pretty good.

391
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Are you excited to play Listless with us tonight?

392
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Oh, yeah.

393
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,020
It was funny. I asked DMN, I'm like, DMN, you want to play Listless with us tonight?

394
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,020
He's like, what?

395
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,020
I guess we haven't played this game in a while.

396
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Sometimes people recognize it from the little theme song we play,

397
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
a little, you know, come on down, come on down.

398
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
Anyway, all right, forget it.

399
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Let's get to the list, shall we?

400
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
I'll get one dollar.

401
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
No, wrong game, DMN.

402
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Wrong game.

403
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
We're making a list.

404
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,020
All right, and just for that smartass remark, I'm going to make you go first.

405
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,020
What would be your number three pick for game that South Park most needs to make fun of?

406
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
Night Trap.

407
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
Night Trap.

408
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Winner.

409
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,020
The old Sega CD game starring Dana Plato.

410
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
Oh, yeah.

411
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
That's a great one.

412
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Good job.

413
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
You're good at this game, DMN.

414
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
We'll see if the rest of your list is up to par, though.

415
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
But first, well, not yet, not yet.

416
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
We've got to go to Loki.

417
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
Loki, you're number three.

418
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,020
I would say Grand Theft Auto.

419
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
Grand Theft Auto.

420
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,020
Is there a particular one in the series you think it should?

421
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
San Andreas.

422
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Because that would be fun.

423
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Okay, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.

424
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,020
Excellent.

425
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Dark Sakura, what would be your number three?

426
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Karaoke Revolution.

427
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Karaoke Revolution.

428
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,020
Would you like American Idol type style?

429
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,020
That's just what I see happening.

430
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,020
All right, that works.

431
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,020
Oh, by the way, just a quick disclaimer.

432
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,020
We don't claim to be South Park gurus, so if we accidentally name something that South

433
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
Park already made fun of, our bad.

434
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
I have watched most of the episodes.

435
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,020
This is like well over 100 that have been made, so I haven't seen them all, but I've

436
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
seen a lot.

437
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
I've probably seen about 100.

438
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,020
All right, my number three pick would be, oh, this is too easy, because just imagine

439
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,020
they could make fun of cosplaying if they did Final Fantasy.

440
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:06,020
All right, so so far on our list, we have Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas,

441
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Karaoke Revolution, and Final Fantasy.

442
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,020
DMN, what would be your number two pick?

443
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,020
Custer's Revenge.

444
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,020
Custer's Revenge.

445
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,020
The old Atari 2600 classic, yes?

446
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Yes.

447
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Yes, where you can rape and pillage in very, very pixelated format.

448
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
That would be interesting to see on South Park.

449
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
I don't know.

450
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,020
All right, well at least they both have crappy animation, so you know it would work out.

451
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Loki will be your number two pick.

452
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Oh, this is tough.

453
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,020
I guess Twisted Metal, because that would be funny.

454
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
Twisted Metal, interesting.

455
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
All right.

456
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Just because it's interesting?

457
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,020
Because it has lots of cars with guns on them.

458
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
Oh, okay.

459
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Dark Soccer, your number two pick.

460
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
Mario Kart.

461
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
Mario Kart.

462
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Just imagine they throw, what was the ball-shaped kid's name?

463
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,020
I don't remember.

464
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
The Little Canadian.

465
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
Oh, Ike?

466
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Ike.

467
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,020
You know how they throw Ike as a thing, and then throw Kenny Ted?

468
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Didn't they have a South Park game that was kind of like Mario Kart?

469
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Yeah.

470
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,020
But they never really referenced it on the show, so I guess it could work.

471
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
All right, we'll see.

472
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
All right.

473
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Let's see, my number two.

474
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:25,020
My number two would be Silent Hill, because they not only have the games, but now the

475
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
movie that they could spoof.

476
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,020
And you know you want to see Pyramid Head in a little cheesy South Park form.

477
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
And he could kill Kenny.

478
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
I have to draw that now, you know.

479
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
He could kill Kenny.

480
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
He'll be great.

481
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
All right, here we go.

482
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Number one picks.

483
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,020
DMN, what would be your number one pick?

484
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Well, seeing as we're on the topic of crappy games, I thought I'd say, hey, why doesn't

485
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
South Park make fun of South Park?

486
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,020
So South Park, the game.

487
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Yes.

488
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Interesting.

489
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Interesting little play.

490
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Why doesn't South Park make fun of itself and its own crappy game that came out?

491
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
Yeah.

492
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Good thought.

493
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Good thought.

494
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Which one?

495
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
The Nintendo 64 one?

496
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Yes.

497
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Yeah, okay.

498
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Good.

499
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
All right.

500
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Loki, your number one pick.

501
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
That would be funny.

502
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
I like that idea.

503
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
Katamari Damacy.

504
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Did you see that commercial this week that was kind of inspired by Katamari Damacy?

505
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Yeah, except the people who made it say they were not inspired by the game in any way.

506
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
I don't watch TV, so I have no idea what it is.

507
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,020
It's on YouTube.

508
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Okay.

509
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
That's the new TV.

510
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
All right.

511
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Dark Sakura, what would be your number one?

512
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
The Sims.

513
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
The Sims.

514
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Oh, that's a good one.

515
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Imagine they do have somebody controlling them walking around town.

516
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
Good one.

517
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Good one.

518
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,020
All right.

519
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:44,020
First, before I name my number one, let's go and look at some chat room picks.

520
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,020
Here's some things the chat room are suggesting.

521
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
O.L. Army Eddie says, Dead or Alive.

522
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
GS68 says, Mortal Kombat.

523
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
Let's see.

524
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Drew Nami says, Africa.

525
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Mechlar says, Loco Roco.

526
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,020
GS68 says, Genji 2.

527
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Ravens Dolphin says, Dead Rising.

528
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Blazer says, Gradius.

529
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,020
All very good guesses.

530
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
Loco Roco would be funny with Cartman.

531
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
That would be funny.

532
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
How about Your Mom the Game last night?

533
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
All right.

534
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Here it is in bed.

535
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
Ooh.

536
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
All right.

537
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Here it is.

538
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
My number one pick is none of those.

539
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,420
It's a game that desperately needs to be made fun of, especially after this week that I

540
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,020
got my hands on it.

541
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Sonic the Hedgehog for 360.

542
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,020
All right.

543
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:34,980
So, here's the list as it stands so far, and we're going to have to take one of these off

544
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
the list, DMN.

545
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,980
You've got to take one of these off the list, and unfortunately the chat room will not be

546
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,520
able to vote for it because you've ruined their hopes and dreams to be able to vote

547
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
for it.

548
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Here it is.

549
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Here's the list as it stands so far.

550
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,140
Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Karaoke Revolution, Final Fantasy, Custer's

551
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:59,940
Revenge, Twisted Metal, Mario Kart, Silent Hill, South Park the Game, Katamari Damacy,

552
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,220
The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.

553
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,420
DMN, which one of these do you say South Park should not make fun of?

554
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,300
Which should come off the list?

555
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,460
Twisted Metal.

556
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Twisted Metal.

557
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah, that was a little obscure, wasn't it?

558
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
All right, Loki.

559
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
This is too old.

560
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Yeah, it is a little obscure.

561
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
Too old.

562
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,020
All right, Loki, what's coming off the list?

563
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
South Park the Game.

564
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,940
It's a crappy game, but it just wouldn't be funny.

565
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,780
You're not into the whole self-parody thing?

566
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,940
I think it just wouldn't be that funny.

567
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
All right.

568
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:40,020
Dark Sakura, what's coming off the list?

569
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,820
Night Trap would be too obscure.

570
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,100
Night Trap is too obscure.

571
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:49,580
As much as I agree, either Night Trap or Sewer Shark or something, nobody, unless they were

572
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,540
in our age range of gamer, probably wouldn't get it.

573
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,980
All right.

574
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,740
Every pick that's left here is actually pretty good, so this is hard for me to take one off.

575
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,940
I'm going to take off... Jamie, don't hate me.

576
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,140
I'm taking off Karaoke Revolution, because since they already made fun of DDR, it's kind

577
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,220
of close for me, so... All right.

578
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
Rob.

579
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
What?

580
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
What?

581
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Rob.

582
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
What?

583
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
What?

584
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
All right.

585
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Hi.

586
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
I hate you.

587
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
No, you don't.

588
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
All right, here we go, Chat Room.

589
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,420
You now have the chance to vote on your favorite.

590
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,700
I need you to give a number one and a number two, and here is what you get to vote on.

591
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,540
All right, and DMN, you don't get to vote, because you already helped.

592
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
Okay.

593
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
All right, here it is.

594
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,940
Here's the list, and I posted it there in Chat.

595
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,780
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Final Fantasy, Custer's Revenge, Mario Kart, Silent Hill,

596
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,400
Katamari Damacy, The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.

597
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,540
Place votes now.

598
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,380
Your number one and number two picks.

599
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,660
Send a private message to Sky in the Chat Room with your vote.

600
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,340
Remember, it doesn't count unless it's over private message.

601
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,300
We'll tally up the votes and reveal it shortly here in the show.

602
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,400
DMN, thanks for your help.

603
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
No problem.

604
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
You guys have a good night.

605
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,460
Hey, anything else you wanted to get out, since we probably won't get back to you during

606
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
call-ins?

607
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,420
Anything else you wanted to get out of your system while we have you on the line?

608
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,740
No, I can save it for another show, I think.

609
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
All right.

610
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Fair enough.

611
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
All right.

612
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,020
Well, DMN, thanks for being here, and you're going to be here in person in about a month,

613
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
right?

614
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Yeah.

615
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
That should be interesting.

616
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
All right.

617
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
I'll get to it.

618
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,020
See you later.

619
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
All right.

620
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
Bye.

621
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
Bye.

622
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
Bye.

623
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
All right.

624
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
Well, some interesting stuff.

625
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,020
It's been pretty dark, but the whole controversy with Bully, apparently, people were wrong.

626
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:41,900
It says Bully has been shown to, E3 was shown to a very few press people, but now that it's

627
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,380
almost out, actually, in the next couple of weeks, it's been shown to a lot more people.

628
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:54,300
Actually, the game itself, which garnered a teen rating, isn't as controversial as it

629
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,060
seems and, actually, pretty fun.

630
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,100
Unfortunately, since all these outrageous claims are made by people that, well, haven't

631
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,380
played the game, it's kind of a whole situation where a lot of people have egg on their face

632
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
now.

633
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:16,180
So, take that, JT.

634
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
All right.

635
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,620
Speaking of politically oriented things, we love those guys over at Game Politics.

636
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,860
We just wanted to give a mention that gamepolitics.com has launched this week and, unfortunately,

637
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,180
it means they have come off of LiveJournal for their commenting system, but they have

638
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,460
a fancy-schmancy new website made in WordPress, so you should check it out, gamepolitics.com.

639
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,760
We just wanted to give them a shout out and Dark Soccer is going to give another website

640
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,900
or a shout out right now because she surfs the web up and down every week.

641
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
At work.

642
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,900
At work, so she can find a pick worthy to share with the rest of you all and it's her

643
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
website of the week.

644
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
Here it is.

645
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:56,420
You know, we should really be using the Mr. Rogers music for this part.

646
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Maybe next week.

647
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
Okay.

648
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,740
At any rate, my site of the week is actually one that another of our listeners linked to

649
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,780
me when I did the Dr. Who site last week, but it's actually a very good Dr. Who fan

650
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
site.

651
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,300
It's Dr. Who online.

652
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:21,540
The website address is drwho-online.co.uk and Dr. is drwho-online.co.uk.

653
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,020
Oh my God, this site is fantastic.

654
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:31,940
They actually have the Dr. Who Online Whocast, which I'm going to be giving a try within

655
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
the week.

656
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,780
Lots of this really good stuff.

657
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:42,300
They have a little area called psychic paper references, just a lot of stuff.

658
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,700
Even an eBay link to a shop.

659
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,900
It's a really fantastic site.

660
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:57,460
I suggest going to it if there's a place to comment or if someone sent you an email.

661
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
Excellent.

662
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,900
Well, got some cool stuff here, especially from the folks that make Gears of War epic.

663
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:11,100
Your thought on the whole Xbox 360 is you don't need to have an HDTV to be able to enjoy

664
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,220
their games.

665
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:20,380
They are making sure by testing their game, Gears of War, on a bunch of small SDTVs, making

666
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,620
sure that you can read the text in the game, unlike say Capcom who couldn't give a flying

667
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:32,360
fuck that you don't have a HDTV, so at least someone's getting it right.

668
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,860
It's awfully good.

669
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
Very reassuring.

670
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:41,500
Well, in other reassuring news, actually, for anyone who's thinking that, oh, Wii's

671
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,860
coming out, I don't have to keep my GameCube stuff, no.

672
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:52,860
The Wavebirds are apparently going to be able to be used on the Wii and certain Wii games.

673
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,620
You will still need your receiver plug-in.

674
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,260
There's a slot on top of the console that you can plug that into.

675
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,700
But there's not really any word out as far as how well it's going to work with Virtual

676
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:13,380
Console, but it's apparently going to work with the Wii anyway, so yay.

677
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,380
All right.

678
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,820
Well, I'm still trying to tally up the Listless votes, so maybe we ought to just go on to

679
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,820
our next story.

680
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,820
We got flooded with...

681
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,820
That's me again.

682
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,780
We have over 50 votes tonight for Listless.

683
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
I'm trying to crazy tally them up.

684
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
I'm sorry, Bobby.

685
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,780
Nice try.

686
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
Nice try.

687
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:33,900
Well, you know, for anybody who is a bit of a snake charmer, you can play with your snake

688
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,780
in public, no less, and not get arrested for it.

689
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,620
There are already Metal Gear Solid 4 figures that will go out with the release of the game

690
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
on the PS3.

691
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,900
A 12-inch tall made by MediComp.

692
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,800
MediComp puts out some really nice figures, by the way.

693
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,860
There's a prototype model up on gaygamer.net that looks pretty cool.

694
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,940
Snake's just really old, though.

695
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,500
I'm sorry.

696
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:12,900
But the figure, though, is they're stating that it may be something about 95,000 yen,

697
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:19,700
up to maybe 20,000, so I don't know.

698
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:26,540
I do think the comment on the forum here is, Snake's got a great ass for an old guy.

699
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
That's true.

700
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,500
Snake does have a good ass for an old guy.

701
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,940
So Rod, how's the tallying going?

702
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,820
I'm almost done.

703
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,900
I was not anticipating this many votes.

704
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
This is crazy.

705
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,520
You guys are making this live experience an awesome one, although a lot of work.

706
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
You know what?

707
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,020
If Drew comes back next week, he's going to be the vote tallyer in the future.

708
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
Well, I'll tell you what.

709
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
In the meantime...

710
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Do you have some last-minute stories?

711
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
Yes.

712
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Let's get right to the end of the show.

713
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
I will kill time for you.

714
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
First off...

715
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,460
We will be opening up the Skype line very soon, ladies and gentlemen, 916-226-9067.

716
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,960
Keep in mind that is a toll call.

717
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,520
By the way, toll-free number coming by the end of the month.

718
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
So that's awesome.

719
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,860
It's going to be awesome.

720
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,280
Also, you can always call us.

721
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,480
The other free way would be to go on to orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us, and get the information

722
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,280
on Skype, username orangeloungeradio.

723
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Go for it, Loki.

724
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,640
Anyways, as we like to do every week, we're reporting some stuff that you might not know

725
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,480
yet, because it hasn't been reported on the front of a magazine.

726
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,520
Well, the first, of course, actually the only one I have this week is Call of Duty 2 on

727
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,120
the Xbox 360, dropped down to $39.99.

728
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,100
So if you don't own it yet, might be a time to find a used one, now they should be even

729
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:43,820
cheaper than that, although, I mean, Call of Duty 3 is coming out in November, so whatever.

730
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,120
It's a good game, though, definitely worth the multiplayer, so check it out.

731
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,480
Some other fun news, Nintendo, there was a whole controversy about the Wii using the

732
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
friend codes.

733
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,860
Well, they're going to make it a little bit easier on you.

734
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,560
They will be using the friend's code system, however, they are going to only require that

735
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,840
you have one friend code.

736
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,200
So you'll be able to share that friend code and then be friended for all the other games.

737
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,520
So that is good, you know, at least a good way to do that.

738
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,020
I swear I had that in the show role, that's crazy, my bad.

739
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,180
And then there's some other stuff.

740
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,960
There was actually legislation that's in the house right now to require the ESRB to actually

741
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,980
play through the entire game before reviewing them.

742
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,320
So that's kind of interesting, I don't think it's going to work because, you know, that

743
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
would take forever.

744
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,720
It would seriously delay the release of all the games.

745
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,640
It would delay games and how would you do, like, MMOs or games that have new content

746
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,640
added to them constantly.

747
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,760
I don't think it's going to work.

748
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
It's unrealistic.

749
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,680
And why are they having, why is the government concerning themselves with this kind of stuff

750
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
anyways?

751
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,680
What I think should be is that I think that on the websites there should be a parent link

752
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:02,120
for any internet savvy parent to go online, get content warnings of the games more in

753
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
depth.

754
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:09,000
I think the manufacturer does have a degree of responsibility to make sure that they give

755
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,680
accurate listings, but if they're really so concerned about it, then they can make it

756
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,520
a requirement for the manufacturers to have more information made available.

757
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,960
Or you know how, like, when you buy food it says for nutritional content, write in to

758
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,520
this address or go on this website?

759
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
I think it should be the same thing.

760
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,200
However, I think that it really is up to the parent to do the research before allowing

761
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,800
their child to buy the game.

762
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,240
As far as children, though, buying the games without their parent's permission, oh well.

763
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,520
Some other fun stuff.

764
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,800
Rockstar announced a brand new series this week actually called L.A. Noire and more information

765
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,240
should be coming out when the official trailer is released on October 5th, and if you want

766
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:59,400
more information on that, you can visit rockstargames.com slash L.A. Noire, that's L-A-N-O-I-R-E.

767
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,880
And looks like it's going to be a game that, of course, you know, kind of pays tribute

768
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:10,120
to a lot of the film noir movies, much like, you know, say L.A. Confidential or even if

769
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,520
you want to go really old, The Maltese Falcon.

770
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,100
So that should be pretty cool, kind of Grand Theft Auto-ish.

771
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,660
So I'm looking forward to that.

772
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,760
And then finally, some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.

773
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,200
As we mentioned before, Sierra's planning on releasing some games to Xbox Live Arcade.

774
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
The first...

775
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
King's Quest?

776
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
King's Quest?

777
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
King's Quest?

778
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
King's Quest?

779
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
There's a couple of games that were announced.

780
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:40,160
Assault Heroes, which is going to be another over-the-head kind of shooter game that, you

781
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,880
know, using two analog sticks, think, you know, Geometry Wars, but still pretty cool.

782
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,080
Then my favorite game, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, and that

783
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,560
was a really fun mini golf game.

784
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,320
I used to piss off people with that.

785
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,360
And then, of course, Codemasters also announced the X06 Sensible Soccer, which I think was

786
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,480
announced even before that.

787
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,240
And of course, a very classic game should be MacKenzie Way.

788
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,600
I wanted to go to the chat room for some comments here.

789
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,480
DNL, who by the way, posted some great artwork to our Live Journal community this week.

790
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,440
Check it out if you're a user of Live Journal or Community Orange Lounge on there.

791
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,320
DNL says, in regards to the ESRB thing, on the back of the package, it does say ESRB

792
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,080
content rating, www.esrb.org.

793
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,480
And also something I wanted to add on that whole ESRB thing is that when you play a game

794
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,900
online, you always do get that, you know, warning that comes up, warning, game experience

795
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,880
may change with online play, doo-doo-doo type thing, so something to think about.

796
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,840
All right, I finally have some results for you guys.

797
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
You ready?

798
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,520
My God, that was a lot of work.

799
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,340
All right, here it is, the definitive list, games we would like to see South Park make

800
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,340
fun of next.

801
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,960
And I got to tell you, this list turned out really freaking weird, considering we had

802
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,700
so many votes, there were a lot of ties.

803
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:07,120
So here it is, the number one game you want to see South Park make fun of was a tie.

804
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:14,360
Game number one, Silent Hill, and game number two, Katamari Damacy, those games tied for

805
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
first place.

806
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Damacy.

807
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
Whatever.

808
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:23,680
And now what's interesting is so that takes us to third place, and there was also a tie.

809
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,240
So we have two games tied for third place, because you know, you have first and second

810
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,440
place basically tied there.

811
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,800
So for third place, we have Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and Final Fantasy are the two

812
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,560
games that came in third place there.

813
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,920
So that is the definitive list.

814
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,480
Thank you guys all for voting and giving me a lot of work there during that segment.

815
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Yikes.

816
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,360
Well, we'll see if any of those actually make it to the show.

817
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,640
And then you can say you heard it here first.

818
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,320
Let's go to the Skype line, boys and girls, and take some calls.

819
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

820
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Who's this?

821
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Raven's Dolphin.

822
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,640
Hi, my friend.

823
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,280
What's on your mind?

824
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,320
I just want to say one news, Ryan.

825
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Yeah?

826
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,920
It's Gamefly.

827
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,080
They actually did some more things with Gamefly.

828
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,120
They now have four tiers now.

829
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,120
Four tiers?

830
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Yeah.

831
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:23,140
Now you can get one game for $15.99, you can get two games for $21, you can get now, they

832
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:29,560
just added this, three games for $30, or you can go for the Kitten Kaboodle, which you'll

833
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,000
lock yourself in your room forever, four games for $40.

834
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,480
Netflix does like eight.

835
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,720
You can do like up to eight movies on Netflix.

836
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,100
So at least I think you can, so I'm not too surprised.

837
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,160
They probably would let you do more if you really want, but damn, what do you need with

838
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,160
five games at a time?

839
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,440
What do you need with four games at a time?

840
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,960
Two is enough so that you have, well, one's really enough, but two is enough so that when

841
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,740
one's in the mail, you still have something to play.

842
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,740
That's right.

843
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,640
So they don't need more than that in my opinion, but whatever.

844
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,280
It's your money, spend it how you want.

845
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,360
Yeah, because I'm poor, I have to save up for a week.

846
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,560
Are you a Gamefly subscriber?

847
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
Yes, I am.

848
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
I don't use them.

849
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
What do you think of them?

850
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,120
I mean, it's not because I dislike them or anything, I just at this time choose not to

851
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,120
use them.

852
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,120
What do you think of them?

853
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,840
Actually, they got really better.

854
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,160
Before at first, they didn't ship my games for like nine days, and now it's coming in

855
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,720
four.

856
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,160
Black Wolf in our chat room is commenting, you just had to be a member for a month before

857
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,780
you got the third game option.

858
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,600
They had three games from Gamefly years ago.

859
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,440
The four games is new.

860
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,240
Well, they just gave it to me for 25 cents this month, Black Wolf.

861
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
I'm sorry.

862
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,200
I guess they're not nice to me.

863
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200
All right.

864
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,320
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

865
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,760
Yeah, one other thing.

866
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,760
What is it?

867
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,760
What was it?

868
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,760
Oh, I know.

869
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,760
I know.

870
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,960
I just bought an iPod, so I'm now mad at Apple.

871
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,120
Why?

872
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,000
Because they just came out with the new Nanos, and it looks like a little mini iPod.

873
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Remember the ones with the black and white screen thing, the iPod mini?

874
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah.

875
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,960
Well, I got an old Nano, so I'm now mad at them.

876
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
You might.

877
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,220
Well, I doubt you could do it, because sometimes if they do a price cut, like a week after

878
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:19,680
you bought it, they'll give you a refund, but maybe not with the old models versus new

879
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
models.

880
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,680
You never know.

881
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,680
Check their website.

882
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,680
I don't know.

883
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Couldn't tell you.

884
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
Yeah.

885
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,680
Yeah.

886
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,680
That's about it.

887
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
All right, Ravenstaufen.

888
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,680
Well, thanks so much for your call.

889
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,920
We'll talk to you again soon, all right?

890
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
You bet.

891
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
All right.

892
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
Later.

893
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,920
All right.

894
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
Let's go to another call.

895
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
We're getting a lot of calls tonight.

896
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
Hopefully, we get to everybody.

897
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,920
Hi.

898
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

899
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
Who's this?

900
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
Hi.

901
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Can you guys hear me?

902
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,920
Yes, we can hear you.

903
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Who's this?

904
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Oh, hi.

905
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
This is Blue Monster from the chat room.

906
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Hi.

907
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,920
What's on your mind?

908
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,920
Hello.

909
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Hi.

910
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
I just wanted to share two things.

911
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,880
The first one is congrats on the show, man, because seriously, it's something I look forward

912
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,880
to every week.

913
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,880
Thank you.

914
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,880
I really appreciate that.

915
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,520
A constant in your life, as I was telling you earlier to Dark Sakura.

916
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,280
Anyways, the second little thing I want to share with you guys is I've picked up Okami

917
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,280
last week.

918
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,240
Yes, that's a game I've heard a lot of great things about and seen a lot of good things

919
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
about.

920
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,600
I'm a little tight on my gaming budget right now, so I haven't been able to pick it up,

921
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
but yeah, I'm really curious.

922
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,480
What do you think of this game?

923
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,480
That's what I actually wanted to call.

924
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,600
I wanted to give you a mini review kind of thing.

925
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,600
It's a pretty good game.

926
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,600
It's a pretty good game.

927
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:32,060
It's very solid-ish, but the only thing I have against it is there's a lot of hand-holding.

928
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,040
The first dozen hours, I put over 24 in it.

929
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
The first 12 hours, it's like nothing but hand-holding.

930
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,880
They tell you everything, the way you've got to stop it.

931
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:45,440
So if you're looking for some hardcore, solid-ish style of gameplay, you'll have a hard time

932
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,320
getting through it, at least for the first half.

933
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,640
Enchanted Arms, which is a game I have been playing lately, is very similar because every

934
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,480
time you go into a new dungeon, it seems like there's some new environmental thing, like

935
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,840
press A to get into the cart.

936
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,920
Press A to move the teleporter, and they'll have to have this whole back and forth where

937
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,640
the main character is like, how do I do this?

938
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,640
And one of the other smarter people in the party says, well, you walk up to it and press

939
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,440
A. But that's the answer every single time.

940
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,760
You walk up to it and press A. They could have just said it in the beginning.

941
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,760
They could have just said it in the beginning.

942
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,000
They have a little tune that's jumping up and down the nose of the wolf, and he tells

943
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,340
you all the time, oh, maybe I should use my brush to cut this vine, which I've been doing

944
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,240
for the past six hours, please don't do it myself.

945
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,900
Maybe you should just have had a thing that says, hey, whenever you see new shit, press

946
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,900
A.

947
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,900
Yeah.

948
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,400
But overall, it's really good music, really good art style.

949
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,680
The graphics are really good.

950
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,160
There is a bit of slowdown because there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen sometimes.

951
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,960
But overall, it's a really good game.

952
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,320
It seems long because I've already put 24 hours in it, and the game actually just got

953
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,320
started.

954
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:56,240
And the hand-holding just now stopped, so I'm guessing it's going to be a long game.

955
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,760
So it's a good game to get if you're waiting for Pilot Princess, I guess.

956
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
Awesome.

957
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,760
Now, one other question I have for you.

958
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,240
For those that don't know much about Okami, maybe we've seen the graphics that has that

959
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,920
very unique hand-drawn style to it.

960
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,440
What would you compare this game to?

961
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,180
If you could compare it to any other game, maybe half this and half this, what would

962
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,960
you say it's kind of like for people that want to know if they'd be interested in this

963
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
or not?

964
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,860
It makes the world of Wind Waker and the style, cartoony style of Wind Waker, but also add

965
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,440
a bit of a stench of Chester Radio or Chester Radio Future, and maybe some beautiful Joe

966
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,440
in it.

967
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
Interesting.

968
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,440
Interesting.

969
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,000
And all those games kind of have that same art style, too, so that's kind of interesting.

970
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,760
The thing is that Wind Waker is very clean-looking, this is more dirty.

971
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,760
The graphics are not that clean because of the brush thing and the whole brush theme

972
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,760
that it has.

973
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,760
So it's more beautiful Joe-ish.

974
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,760
It's still really good.

975
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,360
It's very Japanese, so you've got to be open-minded about it.

976
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,680
It's still a really good game, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes

977
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,880
that kind of game.

978
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,680
And don't be scared, it's not as platformer as it seems to be.

979
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,040
It's more adventure-ish and more pilot-ish, I guess.

980
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
All right.

981
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
Very cool.

982
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,040
Now, hey, I have one more question for you.

983
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,440
You're calling us from Argentina, right?

984
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
I'm calling from Argentina.

985
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,120
It's 1 a.m. in the morning over here.

986
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,120
Awesome.

987
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,120
Oh, my gosh.

988
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
Wow, you're hardcore.

989
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,100
I do have one quick question for you, though.

990
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,040
How much do you pay for games in your country?

991
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,320
Because we know that, you know, we hear a lot about the UK and how they're having to

992
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,000
pay higher prices, and across the board, a lot of other countries have to pay higher

993
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
prices.

994
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
What's it like in Argentina?

995
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,120
Well, here's the thing.

996
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,440
You pay about 80 U.S. dollars for a game in between 70 or 80, if you want the original

997
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,920
copy, of course, because there's a black market here, like, you wouldn't believe, like, you

998
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,600
can buy a game for two bucks if you want to, U.S.

999
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,600
Wow.

1000
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:46,200
But, yeah, but if you actually want an original game, you've got a pony of about 70 pay bucks,

1001
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,520
and it's all games because you don't get the new stuff right away, and you've got to take

1002
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:56,200
into account that a maid here, like a maid full-time maid here, maybe cost 200 U.S. dollars

1003
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,200
a month.

1004
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,200
Wow.

1005
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
Wow.

1006
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,080
So, you know, I know, so it's like, basically, a game is about half the salary of a maid

1007
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,080
for a month.

1008
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,080
Gosh.

1009
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,080
Well, hey, now, your copy of Okami is legit, though, right?

1010
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,080
Not really.

1011
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,080
Uh-oh.

1012
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Uh-oh.

1013
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Well, we better hurry and end this call.

1014
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,900
We won't tell on you.

1015
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,900
We won't.

1016
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,900
We won't.

1017
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,900
We won't.

1018
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,900
We won't give out your full name or anything.

1019
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,900
I'm glad you got to call in, though.

1020
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,900
Yeah.

1021
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,900
Yeah.

1022
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,900
I'm glad I called on you.

1023
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,900
All right.

1024
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,900
It was fun.

1025
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,900
It was really good.

1026
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,040
Well, have fun with the game, and we know that when you can't afford it, you will buy

1027
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,600
the legit copy.

1028
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,680
I already pre-opted this, so, you know.

1029
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,680
Oh, good.

1030
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,680
Good.

1031
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,680
Okay.

1032
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,680
All right.

1033
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Happy ending.

1034
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
All right.

1035
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,680
Take care, buddy.

1036
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
Thanks for calling.

1037
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,680
See you.

1038
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Bye.

1039
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,680
That's great.

1040
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
We love hearing from people.

1041
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,560
We love hearing from employees, but over-plan it because, you know, you're all the way down

1042
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,560
there right now.

1043
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,560
I just got to keep looking south.

1044
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Oh, my God.

1045
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,920
SSJ-100, Matt's going happy ending.

1046
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,800
The thing is, is that I'm in massage therapy school, so I know what you mean, so just don't

1047
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
put it.

1048
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Oh, God.

1049
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
You guys, go play Uno.

1050
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,080
They cover that in massage therapy school?

1051
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,080
No, they don't.

1052
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,400
I haven't started school yet, though.

1053
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,080
Go play Uno, you sick fucks.

1054
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,080
All right.

1055
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,080
Hi, here on Orange Launch Radio.

1056
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
Who's this?

1057
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,080
Hi.

1058
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,080
This is Eddie.

1059
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,080
Hi, Eddie.

1060
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,080
What's on your mind, buddy?

1061
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,080
Yeah.

1062
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,400
I just heard you heard about that thing, like a guy posted on the All Games forums that

1063
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,240
like he was booted out of Uno because somebody saw that he was a black guy.

1064
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,380
I did read that post, isn't it?

1065
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,480
That is so fucked up.

1066
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,800
I did read that post.

1067
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,080
Yeah, somebody, oh, oh, that sucks.

1068
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,680
I don't think I know about this.

1069
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,680
You know what?

1070
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,680
Oh, no.

1071
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,600
God, can we find the post real quick?

1072
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,160
This just made me so angry.

1073
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,440
Some people are so stupid.

1074
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
I swear to God.

1075
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,440
Let's see if I can find it.

1076
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,040
Do you remember what forum it was in?

1077
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,000
It was the... Let me ask you real quick, while I hunt for

1078
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,920
the post, is there any other topics you want to bring up tonight?

1079
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,440
I had something related to that thing.

1080
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:09,040
One of the replies to the article was that that's why the me on the we thing is so good

1081
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,200
because you can create your own avatar or whatever.

1082
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:18,240
I was just thinking that it doesn't really solve the racism issue since if the only way

1083
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,440
to play a game is to create an avatar that is not black, then it's not really a representation

1084
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,720
of yourself if you are black, right?

1085
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,720
Yeah.

1086
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,520
But, it shouldn't matter.

1087
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
It shouldn't matter at all.

1088
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,040
I mean, in World of Warcraft, we play purple and green people and it doesn't matter, you

1089
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,040
know?

1090
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Yeah, yeah.

1091
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,080
And then, you know, when they demoed the we, they showed them making Samuel L. Jackson

1092
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,960
the baddest motherfucker on the planet, you know?

1093
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,540
I would cower in fear if I was playing against Samuel L. Jackson, you know, because he's

1094
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,540
a badass.

1095
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,160
But, man, this is... Wow, people are just so superficial.

1096
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,120
Anyway, I found the post.

1097
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,120
Here it is.

1098
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,200
I realized probably like 50 of you linked it in chat room, but I did find it on my own.

1099
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,200
Thank you very much.

1100
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,200
Here it is.

1101
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,200
This was made by a post.

1102
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,080
The guy is named Five Fingers of Death and this is on allgames.com's forums in the Xbox

1103
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,080
360 section.

1104
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,800
Does vision cam hamper jump in vision of live?

1105
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,880
I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this.

1106
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,640
I purchased my vision cam last week and hooked it up to experience a couple of multiplayer

1107
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,720
UNO sessions.

1108
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,760
When I connected, all three people I was paired with also had the camera.

1109
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:28,580
I heard someone mention, he's a black guy, and then I was booted by the host.

1110
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,560
As we know, live has always had its racist comments, but for the most part, you could

1111
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,520
never really tell who you were gaming with.

1112
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,380
For all we know, David Duke could be playing with Louis Farrakhan and neither would be

1113
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,380
the wiser.

1114
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,880
Now, being able to actually see the person, how will this affect the live community?

1115
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
Just wondering.

1116
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,000
Oh, I can't wait for me to get on the camera and have somebody go, that guy looks like

1117
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,620
a fag, boot him.

1118
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,640
You wouldn't want to play with those fuckers anyway.

1119
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:57,280
I mean, it's fucked up, it's stupid, put all those people on your ban list and warn them

1120
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,800
and damage them the best you can.

1121
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,280
So stupid.

1122
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,840
They obviously don't want to play a good game, good old fashioned game of UNO anyway.

1123
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:12,300
I mean, it doesn't make it right at all, by any means does it make it right, but I guess

1124
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:17,760
until Microsoft steps in, I don't even know what Microsoft can do.

1125
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,360
What can they do?

1126
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:26,800
So it's up to the community, the police itself, I suppose, I don't know, disturbing.

1127
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,720
Anything else you want to say on that?

1128
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,640
Well not on that issue, but take pictures of Cookie Box.

1129
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,640
I will.

1130
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,640
I will.

1131
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,640
So you can get them from Granville Island, one of my favorite places in Vancouver.

1132
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,640
I appreciate it.

1133
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,640
Yep.

1134
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,640
All right, have a good one, buddy.

1135
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,640
All right, you too.

1136
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,640
Later.

1137
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,640
Bye.

1138
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,640
Bye.

1139
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,640
Let's go to one more call.

1140
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1141
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,640
Who's this?

1142
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,640
It's Ron.

1143
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,640
Hi, guys.

1144
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,640
Hi, Jamie.

1145
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,640
Hello.

1146
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,640
You always get through every week, Rama.

1147
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,640
How do you manage it?

1148
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,640
I did it through last week.

1149
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,640
Well, you were here last week, right?

1150
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,640
I made it in the last segment of the show.

1151
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,640
That's right, that's right.

1152
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,960
Oh, what's up, my friend?

1153
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,960
Not much.

1154
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,960
There's a couple of things I want to tell you about.

1155
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,680
Here's a little known fact.

1156
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,680
Mr. Rogers was a sniper in the Marine Corps.

1157
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,000
Isn't that an urban legend?

1158
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
No.

1159
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,040
When I was training with the Marines, they were showing us the tapes of famous Marines

1160
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,040
on the tape.

1161
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
What's it?

1162
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,040
Wow.

1163
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,040
Okay.

1164
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,400
Well, you know, I'm not going to say you're a liar.

1165
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,800
I just always thought that was an urban legend.

1166
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
I didn't think that was true.

1167
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,440
That was the first time I ever heard it when I saw the tape.

1168
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,440
All right.

1169
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,400
Actually, I think I remember my brother telling me something about that.

1170
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,080
Well, me and my brother actually just was released from the Marines.

1171
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,280
Fireboma says, WTF, Mr. Rogers is a camper.

1172
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,920
Well, explain why you're so calm and quiet on the show, you know?

1173
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
Seriously, that's kind of scary.

1174
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,920
You have to have insane nerves.

1175
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,920
I'm going to Wikipedia.

1176
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
I'm going to Wikipedia right now.

1177
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:55,240
You heard about the girl, the young lady that they passed through sniper school who was,

1178
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:02,760
I want to say, an Air Force reservist because they can actually take combat.

1179
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,320
Okay.

1180
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
You know what?

1181
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,680
On Wikipedia, that whole thing is filed under urban legends.

1182
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,680
Here's what it says.

1183
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,040
Fred Rogers has been the subject of a few urban legends, among them ideas that he served

1184
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,040
in the military around the era of the Vietnam War, was a sniper, was a Navy Seal, or had

1185
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,040
a drug problem.

1186
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,840
Rumors to this effect are discounted as being false on urban legend websites.

1187
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,960
Not only is military service not mentioned on any biographies about him, but there wasn't

1188
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,240
a period of time unaccounted for when he could have been involved in such.

1189
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,240
Yikes.

1190
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,240
Maybe that's it.

1191
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,240
I need to give you Wikipedia to your friend.

1192
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,680
But he also was a Presbyterian minister and left the clergy to work with children.

1193
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,680
That's true.

1194
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,680
All right.

1195
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,140
Anyway, I just realized podcast listeners may not understand why we're suddenly talking

1196
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,420
about Mr. Rogers.

1197
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:48,080
We do a bonus segment when we tape live when we'll sometimes play things off of YouTube

1198
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,080
and such, and that was the subject this week was Mr. Rogers.

1199
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,080
So sorry, just for the podcast people's sake who maybe didn't hear that live.

1200
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,280
Anyway, anything else on your mind, Rama?

1201
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,960
I've decided not to buy a PlayStation 3.

1202
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,960
Why is this?

1203
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:07,760
I was watching, I was following like the Sony's podcast, live cast of the PS3 and everything.

1204
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,840
Now they're doing their version of Virtual Console.

1205
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,720
On that fact alone, I refuse to buy one.

1206
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,440
Well okay, but is it because you feel they're ripping them off or something?

1207
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
Yeah.

1208
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,120
They say imitation is the greatest form for flattery, but come on, Sony's been ripping

1209
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,080
off people left and right with the PS3.

1210
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,480
But couldn't you say that the Virtual Console is a form of Xbox Live Arcade?

1211
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:35,600
Yes and no, but the thing is the Virtual Console has all these classic games by Nintendo, whereas

1212
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,960
Xbox Live Arcade is like all these other arcade classic games in a way.

1213
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,960
Not totally though.

1214
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,960
It's not all Nintendo.

1215
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,960
It's like the shade of gray.

1216
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,960
Hold on, it's not all Nintendo.

1217
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,400
Sega's on board and Sega is supposedly going to be on board with the Xbox Live Arcade as

1218
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,740
well in those Sonic the Hedgehog teasers we saw previously.

1219
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,520
So remember that Virtual Console also has, you know, Turbo Grafx-16 and possibly Commodore

1220
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
64 as well.

1221
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,400
True, but I just find it funny after Nintendo said they're doing this, Sony's like, oh,

1222
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,040
we're going to do it too.

1223
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:08,880
Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know, but to not buy a system over it, I mean, what if they

1224
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,880
did it better?

1225
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,880
Eh, I just can't see myself, you know.

1226
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,440
And no, Zuko, I'm not a fanboy, I just don't have 600 bucks.

1227
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,360
There's the realistic reason why none of us are getting a PS3 at launch, at least I think

1228
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,360
I can speak.

1229
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,720
Well, I don't know, I guess Jamie's getting one, but I know I can't afford 600 bucks.

1230
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,000
For 600 bucks, it better come with a lap dance.

1231
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,600
For 600 bucks, it better suck, never mind, I'm not going to finish that thought.

1232
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,600
Yeah, okay.

1233
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
You know what I'm thinking.

1234
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,600
You know what I'm thinking.

1235
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,400
All right, anything else on your mind, Rama?

1236
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,680
That's it, I love you guys.

1237
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,680
Love you too.

1238
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,680
Bye.

1239
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,680
See you next month.

1240
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,680
All right, bye.

1241
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,680
Bye.

1242
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,840
That's right, I'm coming to New York City very soon, and I'll have details on where

1243
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,360
I'm going to be and when, hopefully soon.

1244
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,760
I feel weird because now I think there's at least more than a handful of people that want

1245
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,600
to come meet up, so I feel weird about doing that at a store like Unannounced, so I'm trying

1246
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,000
to figure something out, creative, we can do, we'll see.

1247
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,800
I'll have to work with some people in New York.

1248
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,720
That'll be fun, though.

1249
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,600
Anyways, are there any other last minute stories that any of you guys have?

1250
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,320
Thank you guys, by the way, all of you guys that called in tonight, and sorry to those

1251
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,320
we didn't get to.

1252
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:22,040
We're just running out low on time.

1253
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,040
Not really.

1254
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,040
All right.

1255
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:28,600
I have one quick story I wanted to share here from BamaniStyle.com, has posted a list of

1256
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:35,280
Elite Beat Agents, a song list, at least partial, well, yeah, again, because apparently it's

1257
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,440
being shown off on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, and they were able to get some of the songs

1258
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,840
from the game.

1259
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:46,720
IMCA by Village People, Highway Star by Deep Purple, Rock This Town by Stray Cats, Walkie

1260
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,840
Talkie Man by Stereogram, Makes No Difference by Sum 41, September by Earth Wind and Fire,

1261
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,360
Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne, and I Was Born to Love You by Queen.

1262
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,360
All right.

1263
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,480
If you want to check out what stages those are related to, check out BamaniStyle.com.

1264
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,840
There's a more complete list over there.

1265
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,400
On that note, I guess we're going to end the show, so let's go around and get everybody's

1266
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
final thought.

1267
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,280
Loki, your final thought?

1268
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,920
I don't know.

1269
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,880
I ran out of milkshake.

1270
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,720
I'm sorry to hear that.

1271
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,880
My final thought would be I need to adjust the sound on my new TV because it sounds like

1272
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,680
I'm playing Beatmania in a tin can, and that's not fun.

1273
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,000
DarkSakura, your final thought?

1274
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,360
Reject false icons, and Julie's meeting us for dinner.

1275
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,360
Sweet.

1276
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,360
I need some dinner.

1277
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,180
She has my house keys because she had to feed my cat.

1278
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,560
I need some big-time dinner action, so to do that, we have to finish the show.

1279
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,560
Good night, everybody.

1280
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Thank you so much for supporting independent internet radio, even when the hosts stutter.
