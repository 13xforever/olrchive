you in two parts and if you want to hear all the news we already talked about, youíve

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,160

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,280
this?î Well, maybe we already did or maybe we missed something and you want to email

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,600
us and yell at us about it.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,160
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,740
We love getting emails from you guys.

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,320
We got a whole crap load of them this week because we had a long period there with the

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,800
pre-taping of our show last week.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
Bob is obviously not speaking for me.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
What?

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
What?

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
We enjoy getting emails from you guys.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Oh, no, I love getting emails.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Thatís it.

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
Bob is obviously not speaking for me.

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Oh, you know what I mean.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
I go in there too.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
I peek.

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
I peek around.

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Iím joking.

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
I like getting email.

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,400
Usually youíll share them with me anyway if theyíre really good or really bad.

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,120
I love the hate mail though.

32
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,120
I finally just told somebody off in the email and he was so retarded that his only response

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
was yawn.

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,620
Iím like, ìHaha, pwned.î Iím sure that person is still listening and just got a boner

35
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,620
hearing you say that.

36
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
Good.

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,620
Iím joking because I think that your hate mail is hilarious and really stupid.

38
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,080
So send your hate mail to mailbag at orangealmsradio.com so Dark Star Kara can make fun of it.

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Weíll get to that a little later.

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Weíll get to the mailbag a little later.

41
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,560
But for now, we need some news.

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,320
Loki, save us from this endless debate about hate mail.

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, Toys ë Us did their wonderful pre-orders for Playstation 3 and the Wii on the 29th.

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,920
So that already happened if youíre probably listening to us now.

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,880
And yeah, it was a clusterfuck, much like the Gamestop EB pre-orders.

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,480
They actually were having lines of people lining up a day in advance.

47
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,280
So pretty crazy.

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,480
A lot of the Toys ë Us stores were getting anywhere from like, what was it, I think it

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:26,240
was four to eight Playstation 3s and like sixÖ
