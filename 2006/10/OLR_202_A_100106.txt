Tonight, October 1st, 2006, Microsoft drops some surprises at X06.
Other uses for your Microsoft Points besides Microsoft Arcade.
And will next-gen Castlevania go back to its roots?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast dedicated to video gaming and gamer culture and the gamer news that you guys really want to know about.
At least the stuff we think you want to know about.
I'm here to help you through that.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
How are you doing?
I'm a little worn out.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Say hello to the sober for now, Loki!
Hello.
No, just kidding.
Tonight is not a drunk episode.
We're being very responsible adults tonight.
Right, Techmaster Loki?
Sure.
Maybe he is drunk and he just didn't say anything.
I don't know.
We like to always start it off talking about our gaming weeks.
So let's get right into it.
Let's cut the crap and talk games.
DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?
I played DDR on Tuesday.
Just, you know, extreme games.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One of them was the definite emo kid.
There was the punk girl.
There was the token normal friend.
You know, the kind of nerdy person.
Were they all playing DDR?
They were all playing DDR.
And so I was there with my friend Heather, who's on my LiveJournal.
And we had fun.
Speaking of emo, meeting people from LiveJournal, huh?
Well, I've been friends with her through LiveJournal for like, I guess, a year or so.
And she's friends with my cousins-in-law.
Like, she actually, you know, hangs out with them regularly.
So we just figured, let's finally just go hang out.
So we did.
Cool.
And then we... I went to...
Oh, crap, I lost my train of thought.
Okay.
My friend Tiara, you all know Tiara, my sauce.
She introduced me to a game called Pirate King Online.
It's a new MMO.
Right now it's in open beta.
And it's cute.
And you go around killing things and questing and getting clothes and making pie.
Oh, that's a different game.
I'm sorry.
I was familiar with the other Pirate King, which game I participate on a regular basis.
Is that like a website where you download pirated files or something?
No, I just, you know, I am the pirate king.
Anyway, and then I spent this entire weekend in the Bay Area with, everyone knows Kristen by now.
Yeah, she's been on a couple times.
Yeah, she was too tired to come on the show today.
We went to the Castro Street Fair and it was just so busy and so many people that it was just like, I'm tired.
I'm tired too.
Let's go get some hot chocolate, okay?
So I really didn't play anything else.
Interesting.
I played quite a bit this week.
There was a bunch of stuff I had lined up to play but I never got around to.
The whole hooking up the PlayStation 2 again thing.
I did get to play... Well, first off, my camera, I replaced the vision camera.
And yes, it was defective.
Got the new one, works great.
So now do you feel bad about bashing the camera last week?
No, I don't.
But it's good when it works.
I mean, so now that it's completely clear, I have a personalized picture up.
I played Uno, and I played Uno with the camera, and it's very...
I don't know, it can be boring and I guess weird.
Alright, how many people did you show your ass to?
I didn't show my ass to anybody.
But someone had their camera pointed towards the ceiling and they're all, oh yeah, I forgot to unplug it.
It had fallen behind the TV or something.
And then just another person that was just sitting there and then just someone else.
And you know what sucked?
We only had like three people, I think.
And the computer player just kicked all of our asses, so that kind of sucked.
I did win one game, though.
Good job.
And then, what else did I play?
I played Doom, and Doom was kind of fun, and then Rob dragged me into a multiplayer game, and the multiplayer game was so laggy as fucking hell, but I don't know.
I haven't played any other additional multiplayer games other than that, so I couldn't really say if that's like all the other games.
I seem to have this kind of bad track record with lagging multiplayer games, just from all the
My first Saints Row game was crap, multiplayer-wise was all laggy, and then Doom was all laggy.
So, I don't know.
It looks fun, so I'll probably try that a little bit later.
And then, of course, Nelly's been playing a lot of Zuma, and I've been playing quite a bit of Zuma.
And we're pretty far in that.
We actually have achievements.
We got the one for 24 hours, which is pretty interesting.
That's kind of sad.
She plays a lot, okay.
Seriously, she's been playing 360 more than I have, which is kind of interesting.
Saints Row-wise, I actually have been playing through Saints Row.
It's pretty fun.
I tried cheating this week.
Ooh, food.
But it didn't work like I wanted it to.
You get money accrued to you as time passes in-game.
and so I was just going to leave the game on and have my character walk around in circles with the analog stick.
But somehow it knew that I was doing that and so I didn't get that much money.
Either that or it just wasn't coming as fast as I thought it would.
Either way, I found out robbing a bunch of stores in a row is a lot better than just standing there waiting for time to pass.
I'm going to our always present fourth guest that we have here on Orange Launch Radio, the chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Click on chat.
And I noticed that Jeremy Todd 1 says, OMG, Matt is turning Nellie into a gamer.
She loves her PopCap games, and God forbid they release Bejeweled 3.
I'll never see the 360 again.
That is a vicious lie!
I will never be a gamer, ever!
I will sell my baby before I do that.
Anyways, remind me to shut the door when we tape next time.
No, I did play one other thing.
I got the beta, which is funny because I got this in the mail.
I got the beta for Killzone Liberation, and I don't like it.
I'm sorry.
I don't like what they're doing with the PSP as far as taking these really good first-person shooters and then all of a sudden, look, now it's an isometric third-person shooter game.
and DarkSakura.
Is that it?
Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
Just stop mentioning it.
We know you play the damn thing.
All your work breaks.
Just get over it.
We keep complaining about it and we're like, we gotta switch to another game.
But I'm confident that we'll move on to Vice City Stories and hopefully Multiplayer.
I don't get you.
You're the only gamer I know that'll be like, God, I hate this game and I can't stop playing.
I'm addicted.
What can I say?
Um...
MyGamingWeek
Because of the fact that the game is basically free on the PC, I mean they released the source code some time ago And for the fact that really, you can play Doom on the Xbox 360 without downloading it from Marketplace Just get a copy of Doom 3 Collector's Edition Because the Doom 3 Collector's Edition had Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 as playable games in it
So really the only thing that this new Doom adds is the Xbox Live component, and they touched some things up.
They say the graphics are improved, but come on, it's still the pixelated wonder we all remember from the old PC days.
That being said, I do love Doom.
I do love me some Doom an awful lot.
Yes, Jamie?
It just has ultra-violence and hurt me plenty, and I love the titles of the difficulty levels.
Yes, I mean, it still has all that wonder that made it such a great game in the 90s.
And I'll tell you what, there really is something to be said, because I used to play this game on my slow-ass 486 computer, and I would have to shrink the window down to get a decent frame rate.
You know, I'm squinting on this little 15-inch monitor to play Doom.
and now I'm playing it on my like my new TV that's like 32 inch you know high def I know some of you guys have bigger TVs but just bear with me here you know that big huge screen and height of it's there's something to be said about that the game actually scared me today I turned around and one of those little imp things that looks like that creature from signs that ran by forget it but that thing scared the hell out of me
and I'm like, ah, I shouldn't get scared at this.
These things are pixelated and not supposed to freak me out, but it did.
And so I think there's still something to be said about the fact that Doom still has that, you know, charm and has lasted all these years.
Xbox Live is hit and miss.
Sometimes I get into a quick match game and I played some deathmatch and it works pretty well, but like I played a game with a listener in Loki and it was laggy as hell, so I don't know if one of us just had a bad connection or what was going on, but that kind of made me sad.
But, you know...
I don't know.
If Xbox Live Play is something that interests you, if having this game on your TV set is something that interests you, then it's a decent buy.
And you want to get achievement points or whatever, then cool.
But otherwise, you know, maybe you ought to just download the one that's on the computer if you just want to play Doom and you don't really care about where you do it.
Do the cheats work?
I don't know.
I haven't plugged in my keyboard.
Did you?
No, I read it somewhere, though.
Lame.
I'd have to try it out for myself, though, because, what was it, IDDQD was God Mode, and IDNRA, no, that was, NRA was Hexen.
So somebody tried plugging in the keyboard and doing it, because we thought about it, we just didn't try it.
Oh, that sucks.
Can you use a keyboard as a controller?
I don't know.
That I have to try.
I wonder if the chat room knows the answer.
I'm sorry, I can't play Doom with a controller.
No, it actually really works for me.
Like, I can move around in ways I couldn't before with a keyboard.
The keyboard, if you know your sidestep toggles and everything, it shouldn't be a problem.
Well, you know, there will be people that are keyboard for life.
A lot of PC gamers, if they're mostly the type that games on PC exclusively, they're going to probably be keyboard for life.
But they've gotten used to that.
I still haven't really, I don't know.
I could do it in World of Warcraft, but I can't really do it in Doom as well.
The other kid was IDBFG, I think.
Sorry.
Yeah, that's... I forgot how much I hate the BFG in multiplayer.
I really, really hate the BFG in multiplayer.
Well, thank you to Jada2006's IDDQD, IDKLAV, and IDBFG will give you the BFG.
Nice.
Now our whole chat room is going off.
My game was Hexen.
Yeah, now that I would like to see come out on the marketplace.
Because if you type in Satan, you get God Mode.
Rise of the Triad.
DMN will agree with you.
And also, I was really hoping they'd release Duke Nukem 3D.
I wish.
I really hope that happens.
I want someone to do a Quake hack and turn it into Silent Hill.
You know, that's too bad that we can't load those custom-made Doom WAD files onto Xbox Live Marketplace.
Wouldn't that be cool if they released some of the best ones as add-ons in the marketplace?
I had Gatchaman Doom.
And I would play the hell out of that.
Uber nerd.
I love Gatchaman.
My favorite one was killing Barney, where Barney was the final boss.
I remember that one.
Was that a Wolfenstein hack?
No, they had both.
There's also a Quake one, too.
All right, anyway, moving on from Doom.
I can talk about DDR Supernova now.
DDR Supernova is great.
I mean, if you're into DDR, I don't think there's anything new here that's going to win somebody who hasn't really played DDR before into this game.
Although, you know, just like every other DDR before it, it has beginner modes and things you can learn on.
Konami took some risks with the song list, but I think they paid off.
I rather enjoyed the song list.
And when I say they took risks, I mean they didn't do a carbon copy of the arcade machine, which I think a lot of people were expecting.
But I found some of the new steps and the new songs to be quite pleasant.
I did find it really interesting that they had some of the songs that were just now put into the arcade mix.
It was like Fascination, the Eternal Love thing, which, to be honest...
That's about as interesting to me as Paranoia Survivor and Paranoia Survivor Max.
You know what?
A lot of love out there, though, for Fascination and Eternal Love Mix.
A lot of love out there on the forums for it, so you have your opinion, they have theirs.
As far as the rest of the game, it's obvious that Konami has listened to a lot of the bitches that people had about EX2, especially when it came to Dance Master Mode, because this new
Stellar Magic Mode.
It's kind of neat.
It's a little bit different.
I wouldn't say it's necessarily easier, but it does seem like you can get your unlocks a little bit better.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But it's definitely one of my favorites.
And certainly much better than Max 1 and Extreme War.
It's certainly on the upper end of PlayStation 2 DDR mixes.
So I do recommend it for DDR fans.
And if you hate DDR, well, then you're probably going to hate Supernova.
So there's nothing new for you here.
Move along.
Other than that, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.
I was playing 99 Nights for a little bit.
I was watching my friend play Enchanted Arms because I haven't been playing it a lot.
But I've been watching my friend play through that while I play World of Warcraft on a Mac.
and, um, I went back to Beatmania 2DX because Loki gave me that second controller.
So I was like, ooh, I can play doubles now.
Um, I really suck at doubles because I've lost a lot of my 2DX skill in general.
Like, I'm just barely passing some 7s.
I used to be able to, you know, I used to be able to get some of the flashing 7s out and things.
Um, but I'm working my way up on doubles.
Doubles is fun.
It's kind of renewing my interest in 2DX all over again.
So I'll have to get some of the newer styles.
The newest one I have is Night Style.
Isn't that sad?
There's been like 10th, 11th, and Happy Sky, or 10th, Red, and Happy Sky on the way.
I've played the Pirate King game, and I've gotten Red, and I'm actually looking at more of the Guitar Freaks games like V, and the Silver Collection, or whatever it is, I can't remember what it is.
Some import one.
But next week, though, I was hoping to have a review for it this week.
Earth Defense Force 2 is the game I'm going to be playing, which, for those who may have seen some of the stuff coming from Tokyo Game Show, Earth Defense Force 3 was the first Simple 2000 game that's going to be on the Xbox 360.
So I've got to play the one before it, because that one's not out yet.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Project Silphid
It's pretty.
I also got to see the demo for White Knight for PS3.
That actually could convince me to buy one.
Really?
$49.99 is what Fusion Frenzy is.
See, that's a little high for me.
I don't know.
I don't know if I do enough party game things at the house to justify that.
It's kind of one of those things, maybe after Christmas it'll drop to $29.39.
It's really bad timing, too, because it's coming out a couple weeks before the Wii.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know about Fusion Frenzy.
I'll tell you this, I definitely know about this one though, and I'm sorry because it's probably going to make some people cry, but the Sonic the Hedgehog demo came out on 360.
It's awful.
I told you all!
It is absolutely awful.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Why Sonic the Hedgehog has just gone so awful with this new one.
And somebody pointed out to me, I want to say it was in an email or something, I think it was Rob sent me this, you know, our friend on the East Coast, Rob, I want to say sent me this in an email, something about, you know, the Test Drive Unlimited demo wasn't that hot either, and the final game was pretty decent.
But I don't know.
I don't know if there's much that can save this Sonic.
I mean, the controls are awful.
Trying to manipulate Sonic was just bad.
Where did Sonic go wrong?
Because Sonic hasn't been...
This bad in 3D before, because I remember the last one they had on GameCube wasn't that bad.
It was even okay on... Do you remember the Sonic collection that came out on the Saturn?
It had the 3D running around the world bit in it.
That was better control than... I just... It's awful.
You have to download this just to see how far downhill the series has gone.
It's kind of sad.
It almost feels like they tried to retool the engine or something, but... They're just trying to figure out, you know, how they...
Sonic is just, you know, it's been the same game all the time.
They're trying to really, trying to re-jump, you know, juvenize the whole franchise.
Because, I mean, you had Shadow the Hedgehog, which they were trying to go a different way with it, and it sucked.
It sold horribly.
And then you have Sonic Riders, which, you know, it's a pretty fun racing game.
But, um, and that one actually did pretty well.
Now, Sonic the Hedgehog, the problem is, I think now you've got an...
I don't even know what the... It's like not even close to what the original Sonic the Hedgehog games were.
I mean, as far as the storyline and everything.
Now you're trying to like throw in elements almost like a Final Fantasy or something like that.
I don't know.
And then, you know, all these new characters with each game and stuff.
It's just kind of crazy.
Plus, now that the systems are even faster and they can crunch the graphics even faster, so Sonic is even faster.
But the problem is he doesn't control any better.
So you have the same kind of control...
and Respawn's time as you did on the Sonic games that were slower.
Now that this thing is like lightning fast, it's really hard to control.
I'm going to the chat room and reading some of the comments here on Sonic demo.
FootyMonster says, want to save Sonic?
Go back to Sonic Adventure 2.
Funnydale says, well, you know, the last few Sonic games sucked ass as well.
You know, not this bad, though.
I mean, nothing to me has matched the greatness of the old Genesis ones, Sonic 1, 2, and 3.
And Sonic Spinball, of course.
Nothing has really matched that for me.
But, like, even the last few ones, whereas they weren't that good, they weren't this bad.
Sonic Adventure was probably about the... I'd have to say the pinnacle of the whole 3D...
Sonic the Hedgehog
E3 demo came out, and it hasn't really improved since then.
So that kind of... Either a couple things happened.
One, they just didn't have time to make a new demo, so they just put out the E3 demo.
Or two, the game hasn't really improved since then.
All right, well, if you're a fan of the new Sonic game, maybe there's something about it we're missing.
We'd love to hear from you.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
We're always willing to hear some difference of opinions.
We might say you're wrong, wrong, wrong.
But no, we'll definitely...
Read your emails on them.
Now, Jamie, did you see SmackDown vs. Raw 7?
I actually found a story on that that we're going to be discussing.
Well, I guess we'll get into the news since we're starting to touch on some of the things we wanted to talk about tonight.
And the first thing in tonight's gaming news is, of course, as we talked about in our gaming weeks, Doom came out on Xbox Live.
What was somewhat interesting about the way Doom came out on Xbox Live is that it was very stealth.
Microsoft had said that there was a secret project they were working on and a really big series was coming to Xbox Live and some other folks had speculated that the series was Lode Runner.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, certain websites we don't like to talk about broke the embargo.
Good for them.
So anyway, of course, Doom Live supports multiplayer on one screen or on multiple screens via Xbox Live.
It is Doom 1, not Doom 2, and some people would say Doom 2 is the superior game.
But who knows?
If this is out now and does well, I'd say Doom 2 is just a matter of time.
But as a reminder, if you have the Doom 3 Collector's Edition, you already can play Doom on the Xbox 360.
But, you know, of course, with this you get achievements.
Slightly improved graphics and the Xbox Live Play.
Next we'll see Quake 2 because that was on Quake 4 except it had achievements but you didn't get any points for it.
How about Quake 1 with the original Trent Reznor music?
That would be kind of fun.
That would be really fun.
I was also surprised that Doom 1 was only 22 megabytes to download but then again I guess that's probably how big it was back then.
Back then my hard drive was only like 100 megabytes so it was a huge game at the time.
I remember spanning floppies with that thing.
Well, as far as things that we need to see about, our dear, dear director friend Peter Jackson has decided that he's got his interest in
Stuck in the Xbox 360 as a new medium for storytelling.
He said that his team at Wingnut Studios is working with Microsoft to co-design and co-produce an original chapter in the Halo stories with Bungie.
They haven't named it or anything yet, but the quote says here, to captivate a new audience that have yet to discover the power of interactive entertainment.
I think that's pretty neat.
You know, it's good that big names are starting to recognize, you know, exactly just the basically limitless freedom that a video game will give them in terms of creativity.
I think it's kind of interesting.
You know, I can't claim to be the world's hugest fan of Lord of the Rings.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I thought the movies were good.
But I think this is really neat, and it sort of, to me, legitimizes gaming in a way.
I mean, here you have this Oscar-winning director coming over and saying, hey, I'm going to make a game.
And it's a little different than previous, you know, attempts to kind of bring Hollywood into games a little more.
Like, does anyone remember Apocalyptico, or what is it?
Was that the name of the game?
Apocalypse?
That's a band.
Apocalyptic is a string quartet.
Sorry, I'm thinking of the Mel Gibson movie.
No, there was a game on PS1 with Bruce Willis.
Was it Apocalypse?
I think it was Apocalypse.
Something like that, okay?
And that game was not so hot.
Well, the movie was not so hot.
Well, it wasn't based on a movie.
Wasn't it?
I don't think so.
Wasn't Bruce Willis in a movie called Apocalypse?
I don't know.
It was where they had to go drill a hole in the meteor?
No, you're thinking of...
Armageddon.
Armageddon.
Same difference.
Oh, my God.
No, this is different.
This is this was like a I don't know.
But anyway, just to expand.
Well, sorry.
Go ahead.
There was a little bit more.
Yeah.
Just to expand.
We Net Studios that I referred to earlier is Peter Jackson's new entertainment studio that is has his movie team and Microsoft's gaming division working together.
I thought that's pretty cool, too.
I have this theory that he probably saw it in progress, was really inspired and said, hey, I want to be a part of something else.
That's a distinct possibility.
I mean, that's how half of anybody really gets into anything, is they have to be introduced to it first, right?
Well, some other cool stuff came out about the Halo franchise during Exos 6.
Unfortunately, nothing about Halo 3, because they said, later on this year you'll hear something, which would probably be timed with the PlayStation 3 launch or something like that.
But anyways, one very interesting thing, which kind of ties in with the whole story we had last week about the...
Cease and desist Cease and desist
It came out that they're actually making a Halo RTS type of game called Halo Wars.
It's being put together by Ensemble Studios and Bungie.
Ensemble, you might remember, did the Age of Empires series.
So, should be pretty cool looking and kind of by the looks of the trailer that also hit the Xbox Live Marketplace, it looks very StarCraft-ish.
So, should fill that void a little bit at least.
That'll be a fun one to play on live, I bet.
Yeah.
It'll be hugely popular.
I think so.
I think they're trying to
I almost grabbed the same audience of StarCraft with this.
Now I have a question for you guys.
Do you think that this could be, you know, with this Peter Jackson project and Halo Wars and Halo 3 on the horizon, is this too much Halo?
Are we headed for an oversaturation of Halo in the market?
No, I don't think so.
Because the time frame that these games are coming out with, this, you know, one that Peter Jackson is probably working on, probably won't even see it next year, if you know anything.
So you have like Halo 3 coming out,
Halo 3, Halo 3, Halo 3
and a lot of people are still very skeptical about that release.
But could this be now that we know that there's another Halo project being worked on?
Because everybody was saying, oh, Halo 3's got to be Christmas.
Halo 3's got to be Christmas.
Is it possible that now Halo Wars is their Christmas title and Halo 3 is indeed going to make the March or April release?
It's possible.
Speculation.
I don't know.
Well, did you see the story this week about, what was it?
Amazon.com had Halo 3 pre-orders and the release date was March 31st, which I thought was interesting.
Huh.
But, you know, who knows.
We'll see what happens.
Now, again, and I hate reading from the same person consistently, but everybody else is doing flooding in our channel right now.
Jeremy Tom 1 says, Bungie is turning into EA.
They are starting to put new Halo games out every year and seriously milking the franchise.
Wrong.
This isn't like Halo 06 or Halo 07.
They're actually mixing things up instead of just...
Updating rosters
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the few tactical games that held my attention I'm just not really into tactical games usually Why hasn't there been a new Final Fantasy Tactics?
Because Square Enix has bastard people working for them
Just kidding, just kidding.
Alright, anyway, another news that came out of X06, it's of note.
No pun intended.
Guitar Hero 2 has finally been confirmed for the Xbox 360.
We've been speculating this for weeks and weeks, so this really shouldn't be big news, but it was confirmed officially.
There's a new controller coming out as well.
Despite news reports that were based off some pictures that were taken at XO6, the controller is not wireless.
There's no word yet if the controller will be wireless or not, if there will be a wireless version.
I kind of hope there's not, or if
If there is, I hope they offer a wired version still, because wireless means more money.
And the last thing I want to have to spend on Guitar Hero is more money.
It's not, and that's because it's a requirement that they have for their third-party peripheral makers that it has to be wired, which is weird, because I thought that they had wireless controllers made by, like, Madcatz and stuff.
But I guess when it comes down to these weird, you know, like, guitar controllers or dance pads, it's got to be wired.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
on PS2 when it comes out.
I'm going to wait for the 360 one.
That's kind of sad.
Because if it's going to have the microtransactions and the next-gen graphics, and I've pretty much been starting to play Xbox 360 more and more, and I know I'll be playing Wii more and more when that comes out, and eventually, when I finally decide to buy one, PlayStation 3, you know, I'll kind of be phasing out the old-gen games.
I don't know if I really want to pick up Guitar Hero 2 on PS2.
I don't know.
Do you guys feel similar, or...?
I would have personally announced this at the end of the year.
And then make us feel really screwed.
That would have been great.
It's a way to make more money.
I guess that's true.
Jamie, what do you think?
I know you're a Guitar Hero fan.
Are you going to purchase the one on PlayStation 2?
Are you going to hold out for this one, or what?
Why don't I just get them both?
I forgot.
You're a whore for everything.
Gaming.
Gaming.
I don't see where the debate is.
I have both systems.
I should have both games, especially if they do something different for one than the other.
Honestly, my preference would be to have it on Xbox 360 if they're not doing anything different for it.
because I would rather not have, like, jaggedy edges and I'd rather have better, you know, music, better sound capability and, you know, more processing power and the ability to potentially download more songs.
Yeah, exactly.
For me, it's like Karaoke Revolution on Xbox versus PlayStation 2.
As much as, you know, I love the PlayStation 2 and it's great, but when you put the two platforms side by side in a game like Karaoke Revolution, I could download more songs on the Xbox version and it just...

Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Oh, did he say that the Guitar Hero doesn't have that great graphics?
It doesn't have that much in the way of graphics in the first place.
Yeah, it does.
DDR is just like a bunch of movies playing in the background with like a character dancing.
Right.
No, this actually has a whole lot that went into it.
Which is actually part of the reason it did so well is because it really kind of had that silly quality to it that kind of puts you there.
You know what I mean?
Like you having all that stuff and the crowd and everything kind of
Did something for the game in a way the Guitar Freaks didn't.
You know what I mean?
This is what I actually liked about it.
It sort of incorporated the things I liked about Karaoke Revolution.
You have the stage and the whole contest thing.
It sort of puts a little bit more into the game.
I thought it was like, yeah, let's go ahead and rock out here.
I thought that that was pretty cool.
It added a great deal of fun to the game.
Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, his own show is over at allgames.com on Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific.
He says, it hit me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Well, now you guys know how we feel, you know, being DDR fans about all these DDR pads for the different platforms, too.
It's like, God, I have five DDR pads.
Why don't you just get the multi-pad?
But even then, the Red Octane one, the last one they did, it doesn't support 360, so there's going to be another pad that comes out I'm going to have to get for frickin' universe.
Oh, well.
And you know they're not going to just go, let's support the USB pad from Red Octane.
You know, let's do that.
Let's do that favor.
No, that's not going to happen.
I do like the 360 guitar that looks like a Thunderbird.
But anyway, we have a little bit more.
Now, I don't know if all our listeners know this, but I am a closet wrestling fan.
So there is a demo for SmackDown vs. Raw available on Xbox Live Marketplace for the 2007 version.
Also joining that is Tony Hawk's Project 8, Wheelman, Frontlines, Fuel of War and Crossfire, and the montage thing, which I actually haven't watched yet.
Also for our listeners who are in France, Italy, Germany, or Spain, if you missed the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion download content, it is back up for 150 Microsoft points apiece.
But I want my wrestling.
Yeah, they had some pretty good videos up on live marketplaces.
Some interesting stuff also coming from Exo-6, of course, a lot to even mention.
But, of course, they announced that Splinter Cell 5, the one after Double Agent, is going to be exclusive to the 360, which I thought was pretty interesting.
Bioshock, the very amazing looking game, is going to be a 360 exclusive, which is coming out in April, by the way.
And also on the Windows platform.
The game looks amazing, so if you haven't checked out the video yet, please do yourself a favor and check it out now.
Some surprises, I should say, Banjo-Kazooie, they announced a new game in that franchise for the 360.
Some not so big surprises, Project Gotham Racing 4 was being worked on.
and they had a very generic looking trailer for that.
The trailer was a joke.
I mean, it was nothing but... It was kind of like the Simpsons teaser trailer.
Well, at least that was funny.
I mean, it had a gag in it.
But, you know, there really wasn't anything to it.
You know what I mean?
This is kind of like, the game's coming.
Soon.
I mean, but the Halo 3 teaser trailer was like, ooooh.
you know, I am the future you know, that whole thing that's how you do a teaser trailer there will be an MMO coming to the Xbox 360 with Marvel Universe Online which is supposed to be kind of a sequel to what was it oh, I'm drawing a mental blank now I was going to say, you know, Phantasy Star Universe is coming soon, that's an MMO well, no, City of Heroes it seems to be working together on that and they'll also be hitting Windows Vista as well
and it's even being worked on by Cryptic Studios, the, of course, creators of City of Heroes.
And then finally, the last bit of info they talked about was the HD DVD player for the Xbox 360.
It's going to be priced at $199 in North America with pretty much equivalent pricing in the rest of the world.
And they will be including a free copy...
Not too surprising after the whole announcement of Peter Jackson working on Halo of King Kong as well as Universal Remote.
That's a good movie to test your player on because it's a nice, good, long, very long, very overly long sample movie to include to test on the HD DVD player.
So, yeah, lots of good stuff coming out.
I like the movie.
It was just... There was some other announcements, I think, that have already been made before about how Rockstar is going to be making exclusive content for the Xbox 360 version of Gran Turismo 4, which is not a huge... I mean, it's big, but we already know that.
And...
Yeah, just lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of games and trailers, and they showed off Half-Life 2, and that looked pretty and stuff.
Now, out of curiosity, did Rockstar say that they weren't doing something similar on PlayStation 3?
I mean, I know they said these episodes or whatever were exclusive for 360, but if PlayStation 3 supports microtransactions, which after last week's Gran Turismo thing we know it's going to, what's to say that they won't cook up different scenarios for the PlayStation 3, and it'll be...
Or additional two, these two.
Or some different scenarios that are going to be on PlayStation 3.
So it's that whole Soul Calibur 2, play with Link on the GameCube, play with Spawn on the Xbox all over again.
Something a little different.
We don't know a whole lot about the PlayStation 3 marketplace or whatever.
So they might be running other obstacles with this type of stuff.
Because if you notice, a lot of companies, I know Sega for
Virtual Attendance 3 actually took out online play on it for the PlayStation 3 version because apparently they're running into some difficulties so yeah I'm I wouldn't be surprised if you see something especially if the marketplace is taken off you know after the PlayStation 3 launches I mean Grand or Grand Theft Auto 4 is just gonna be the next big thing I mean it's just huge so
Saints Row will whet the appetite for now, but I can't wait
Well, now, the only news to come out this week wasn't just about the Xbox.
I mean, granted, we have a lot of Xbox news because they had, you know, their big X06.
But there are some news on the other consoles.
One thing I want to say about the PlayStation 3.
According to Bloomberg, Sony is going to be launching a massive PlayStation 3 marketing campaign.
Now, they're going to have demo kiosks in five times as many stores as the PlayStation 2.
Yeah, the PlayStation 2 had about 3,000 demo stations.
The PlayStation 3...
is supposedly going to have like 10,000 up to maybe 15,000 demo stations.
So that's like five times as many if it's 15,000, which is kind of weird when you consider that there's supposed to be that big console shortage they're going to have at launch.
So it's like, you know, you could be putting some of that into producing extra consoles, but whatever.
I mean, they're not saying that all five times of this is going to hit at once.
So who knows?
Maybe they're running all off of the rack mount servers.
Maybe that's what they're going to use them for afterwards.
Who knows?
That actually might not be a bad idea.
Who knows?
That just was so pitiful.
I know, I know, I know.
You've got to do what you've got to do.
Three steps in the right direction, because they're going to need to market the hell out of this thing.
To convince people, here's why you need to spend $600 on this.
Well, you said it right there.
And I mean, even the most fanboy of Sony has to admit, you know, Sony needs to show us and the casual gamer why you want to spend $600 on this system.
So they do need to put it out.
It should be demoing Blu-ray movies and some hot trailers of PS3 exclusives.
Put some Metal Gear Solid demos on there, you know, something like that.
Really sell the hell out of your system and that might help you.
Well, actually, this is sort of related to something that was just given to me not a few moments ago from our chat room.
Sure.
PSM got an actual... Their PlayStation magazine got an actual fully functional PS3 console delivered to them.
Hmm.
That's not too surprising.
Well, yeah, it is PSM, so that makes sense.
But I think it's pretty funny that they, you know...
They're actually starting to get these out now to, you know, I guess they're VIPs.
They should have sent it without games because, you know, they said, you know, the PS3, you'll buy it even if it doesn't have games because it's PlayStation.
There's a reflection of Motorstorm showing on the console in this picture.
It's pretty fun.
But anyway, as far as...
Other systems coming out.
Walmart.
Yes, everybody's favorite low-price store of crappy goods.
Hey, but don't laugh.
I get decent stuff there once in a while.
It's not my favorite place to shop.
I got the best shirt there.
It says, I love pirates and has a pirate ship on the butt.
But anyway.
Walmart is considering not using the Wii demo station at their stores because of the risk of a child or consumer...
Thank you for watching!
Maybe it's not so far off.
Maybe it is something to consider.
But I'm thinking, they've had the eye toy for PS2 demoed there, and that's one of those games that encourages you to flap your arms about.
Flapping, hitting somebody with your hand, you know, just by accident, is a lot different than smacking somebody in the head with a piece of hard plastic.
Yeah, but won't they have the hard plastic on some type of chain, or it's only going to have a limited range anyway?
I don't give the, you know...
Corporate powers that be at Walmart that much.
Mental.
You end up getting broken or stolen.
I honestly, I'm not surprised.
But that just means that people will go to places other than Walmart to buy their Wii, won't it?
Not really.
Well, you may not have an option in some parts of the nation.
No, people will just go to other parts, you know, other stores to demo the Wii.
They can buy it at Walmart because they're the low price leader, of course.
They're also the low quality leader, too.
Yeah.
Hi Walmart!
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily... The one good thing about Walmart is that when I lived in Alabama, Super Walmart was open 24 hours and I had somewhere to go and I was bored.
Wow.
At the Denny's.
Walmart.
You know what, when I was in college in Chico, it was the same thing.
We'd go to Walmart because we were bored and they were open 24 hours.
We'd basically, this is before I even heard of Eddie Izzard, we would do the Eddie Izzard theory of shopping where you just grab stuff, move it around, and then leave.
Because that's illegal!
Anyways, some other stores that I used to like to go to at least as a kid, Toys R Us.
What happened to Toys R Us?
So sad.
Really?
I actually sometimes do my gaming shopping there.
They have Jeffrey Chained in the basement.
Now that they've combined Kids R Us and Toys R Us and Babies R Us, it's less Toys R Us and more toddler crap.
They still have a pretty decent video gaming section, I've got to say.
And if you've ever been to Toys R Us in Times Square, it's hot.
Some of those big, big Toys R Uses are hot.
Okay, well, I haven't been there, but anyways.
One of the things that they had, of course, is their holiday list of must-have items.
And, of course, on the list was the Nintendo Wii.
What wasn't on the list?
The PlayStation 3.
The reason behind this is a couple things.
One, the PlayStation 3 is really geared towards savvy gaming enthusiasts, whereas the Nintendo Wii is basically going to appeal to young kids as well as adults.
The other thing is, one of their criteria for making this list is knowing that they're going to have a sufficient stock for the item during the holiday season.
Which we know that the PlayStation 3, that will not be the case.
So, very interesting.
I do see this, I think the Wii would kind of mesh very well with Toys R Us.
It seems to be the same kind of clientele, so.
All right, well, as Loki was saying, part of the reason that Toys R Us maybe put the Wii on their list is that they're not expecting to have a shortage.
Nintendo has confirmed they are going to be shipping one million units of the Wii in North America on November 19th.
Now, when I say North America, that means, you know, U.S.
and Canada, so you Canadians will get some lovin' from Nintendo, too, so no worries.
Because, actually, the news came from Nintendo of Canada's vice president, saying, "'We're looking at a million units for North America at launch.'"
Now, you may remember that previously our dear friend Reggie said that 4 million Wiis will be out by the end of the year, the majority of them for North America.
And now it's confirmed that about 1 million are going to hit North America.
And I'm expecting probably another million by the end of the year.
Now, there was a late update that suggests that perhaps there might even be more than a million that hit on launch day.
Because, you know, I'm thinking...
with as huge as people are expecting this to be, a million may not be enough.
I would still think they're going to be sold out.
Even with a million, they're going to be sold out some places.
Yeah, I think they're going to be sold out no matter what.
But, you know, at least they're going to have a million units.
And a million is a good number to put out there.
It's a safe number instead of saying, we're going to have four billion units at launch, you know, and just shipping only four, you know.
Yeah.
So.
I don't know.
It should be pretty cool.
Some of the cool stuff about the Wii, though, came out this week.
Also, talking a little bit about some of the Wii channels, including the Wii Message Board and the new one I haven't heard of, at least, Play History, which Play History is going to be sort of similar to the... kind of like what the 360 has, where you can see the games that people have played and stuff.
But I think they're even going to go...
To greater detail with that, because originally the play history was supposed to be a way for parents to be able to limit the amount of gaming kids would have.
So you'd be able to shut the console off after a certain amount of hours and stuff.
Apparently that didn't work out too well, so this came to be instead.
So play history will actually be charting a bunch of different stats, of course the majority being your game playing time.
Now, the Wii message board is kind of like a little mini, almost email or message board system.
You can leave messages for other people that use the Wii, as well as send those messages to mobile phones and, you know, I would imagine PCs and email and that type of stuff.
Plus, certain games, say like Animal Crossing, may send you messages as well, you know, so you'd be getting the email's.
or the mail from Animal Crossing in your message board.
So, it's kind of neat.
You know, this whole play history thing is very interesting to me.
So, in other words, like, if I'm staying up past my bedtime to play the Wii, if I'm a savvy enough parent, I can go in there and see that, you know, my kid's been up past his bedtime playing the Wii and I can take the cord or, you know, something away.
I don't know.
That's kind of interesting.
What do you guys think about that?
Is that a good thing or is that... Sure.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's a good thing because you know what?
Parents need the tools.
If they are having trouble monitoring the amount of gaming their kids have and they want to, I think it's good that they're providing a way for them to be able to do that.
And you know what?
Whether they use that or not, that's kind of up to them.
But at least Nintendo is providing you tools.
Same thing with the lockouts for different content based on the content ratings.
If they have those parental locks in place, at least they're providing them the tools
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's the same.
Well, if it's tracking it in the play history, I mean, it's always connected to the internet.
How do you feel about TiVo tracking what you watch?
I mean, I'm just, I actually, well, I'm just, I'm playing Devil's Advocate here.
I don't think it's a big deal because 360 does the same thing.
You know it does.
Who cares?
Because you can see the last five games you've played and it's, you know, I'm sure.
Unless they come out with like, you know, some nasty ass porn games, you know, then whatever.
Who cares?
So they know what I'm playing.
Big deal.
Okay.
Just curious.
I do think that there is an advantage in checking it in terms of, especially if you've got your general region in terms of demographics, they'll know what games are being played more in what areas, who to market to, what to market.
I actually think that if they use it for their sales, from a sales perspective, it can really increase their profit by gearing toward the different audiences, seeing who's playing the most of what.
DarkTetsuya says, Gal's Panic on Xbox Live Arcade.
I can only hope someday.
I want Gal's Panic on DS.
Not necessarily, I think.
Yeah, they track through sales.
But sales doesn't tell you exactly who's playing what.
It would be an interesting comparison.
Sure, people bought this, but how long are they actually playing it?
That's my point.
Before they sold it back to GameStop.
That's my point.
I think if you see what type of games have the most playability, what's going to have the most longevity, then they're going to be able to say, okay, well, we put this here, and then we say, do you want to keep renewing your experience on this game?
Here is X add-on.
You know what I just realized?
Nintendo's already tracking what games you play on the DS.
Because if you go to NintendoWiFi.com, it shows the most popular Wi-Fi games and the last 20 people that played them and everything.
You know, Nintendo's been, quote-unquote, violating your privacy in that way for some time, but I don't think it's a big deal.
I think violating privacy is posting your pictochat.
Yeah.
You know, having big pictures of, like, a bunch of cocks up.
Or, you know, if I moon one of our listeners on Uno on Xbox Live Arcade, I wouldn't want Microsoft to post that on the interweb.
Free on Xbox Live!
Rob's ass!
Sorry, sorry.
It's a theme that you can download this week.
I would not download the Rob's ass theme, sorry.
I would not allow it to be distributed.
Anyway...
This is something much more exciting.
I squeed like a little girl and probably did run around the house naked when I read this news.
When I saw this and I posted it, I knew that you'd be squealing like a little girl.
This made me squeal like a little girl.
There's a rumor out there.
I don't know if it's rumor or fact or what's going on, but Commodore 64 is supposed to be joining the Wii Virtual Console lineup.
I played so much, like Commodore 64 was my gaming system in that period between the 2600 and the NES for me.
Like, oh my god, this makes me so happy.
Gamasutra is reporting that the virtual console update says that no game titles are specified, but there are indications that classic epics titles, games like California Games, Summer Games, Impossible Mission, and Jumpman, oh!
may make an appearance.
Ooh, I love you, my Jumpman.
Oh, God.
And they announced this a matter of time before they announced, like, you know, M-U-L-E, pinball construction set.
Jumpman was my game on the Coleco.
That's what I used to play all the time.
Well, now, what's interesting is that when Kotaku posted this story, one of their...
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Quote, a Nintendo Power editor merely speculated the announced Commodore 64 games would come to the Virtual Console when in fact two are being remade for the PSP, DS, and Wii.
To quote, System 3 will release Impossible Mission on the PSP and DS in January of 07.
Three weeks later it will come to Wii with California games for PSP and DS in May of 07.
And again three weeks later it will come to the Wii.
Huh.
You know, either way, no matter where these games are coming, I'm just really excited to see some Commodore 64 love in this era of gaming, because damn, I loved me some Impossible Mission, although that game was impossible as fuck.
It was called Impossible Mission for a reason.
It was so hard.
I want the old Apple IIe games.
Like Oregon Trail?
Yeah.
Are you waiting for Oregon Trail to come to Virtual Con?
Gnarly Golf.
And I want old school kicks.
That was my favorite game, Gnarly Golf, on the Apple IIe.
And yes, I did play Apple way back in the day when that was the only option for actual gaming.
Which is ironic, I mean.
You guys, I still sometimes dust off the Atari 5200 just to play kicks.
That's pretty cool.
Alright, well, you know, with all this Wii Virtual Console news, I'm sure someday you'll be able to send us messages on the Wii and they'll come up on our screen.
DarkSakura.com
Well, my actual favorite email out of this lot came from Warrior Bob, but it's really, really freaking long.
So, if you don't mind, I'm going to post it up on the forums because it is really long.
You know, just really long emails get posted on the forum.
How about that?
Um, anyway, got one from Mekar.
Wait, was the Warrior Bob one, the really long one, and then like, you know, he's making, he's talking about, you know, the next gen gaming, and then at the very end it says, so in conclusion, Byright sucks.
In conclusion, that's exactly what it says, in conclusion, Byright sucks.
That made me crack up when I read it.
But I like this last line, though.
I can assure you that years from now, I'll still be playing something really, really old alongside my newest, shiniest game.
I actually should put that out there.
We're no longer going to be asking your permission to post your letters.
If you send us something to Orange Lounge Radio's mailbag, here on out, you've been warned we might post it on our forums.
But out of respect, unless you want us to, we will post nicknames but not real names.
Yeah, yeah.
To protect the not-so-innocent.
Anyway, Meklar wrote in, I started listening to Orange Ones Radio last week on your 200th episode.
I must say it was my first podcast and I haven't laughed so much in ages.
God, what a one to have as your first one.
Just to say thanks for putting out a great show and it's nice to see a US show mentioning the UK.
I also have to admit that you guys were responsible for me purchasing an Xbox 360.
I'd heard some okay stuff about it, but hearing all the good stuff you guys were saying about Saints Row and Dead Rising got me interested.
Wow.
The live arcade information sold me.
So on Friday I went out and spent the 365 pounds on 360 and Dead Rising and Saints Row.
I'm so happy I got it.
It rules.
Thanks.
So thanks, guys.
Couldn't they just slice the price by five pounds so a 360 would be 360 pounds?
Duh.
That'd be funny.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, come on.
It's five pounds, which I realize is like, you know, seven or eight bucks US, but still it's not that much.
So.
That's a very nice compliment that somebody would go out and make that kind of investment based on what we've said.
It's even more so the investment in the UK because things are more expensive over there.
So that's a very nice compliment.
It's very interesting since it's all lies.
We love the 360.
What?
I think you are drunk.
Our next email doesn't actually have a nickname on it, so I'm just going to say it's from Sean.
Sean?
Hello, OLR.
I wanted to first wish all of you a happy belated 200th episode.
I've been listening to your show for forever, but haven't really interacted until just now.
Just felt like thanking you guys for being awesome.
I saw you guys at B3 and everything.
You guys are the best.
Anyway, just wanted to know...
What are your thoughts on microtransactions and games in general?
And also an opinion on the news that Gran Turismo HD will be almost entirely microtransaction based costing only the cost of the disc and packaging but with the premium mode having a few tracks and cards available from the start.
In my opinion it defeats the purpose of having the game to begin with
as I always play the Gran Turismo games to rack up huge amounts of money and unlock new tracks and cars and whatnots and just have fun.
I don't want to have to actively make purchasing decisions for a game.
I just want to pay my 50 to 60 bucks and be done with it.
And while I understand that this is a popular trend in Korean MMOs such as MapleStory and Pangya Golf, those games actually have content that you can earn which makes playing them fun and having the purchasable items as a bonus to look cool only.
I want to be able to earn cars just like I've been doing for the last four GTs instead of their new version of a game where you play it only for a few minutes a day.
I just wanted to know your thoughts on it and let you know that you guys rock and I hope you keep podcasting into the future.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I think this is funny.
Haz in our chat room says micro-rapeman is more like it.
I do have to say the micro-transaction thing for a racing game, I was going back and thinking about it, you know.
and if it's trying to... The point of Gran Turismo was the point of putting you into a realistic racing situation, right?
Well, if you are a professional racer, you are going to go out and spend money to buy your cars, to buy your upgraded parts.
You are going to go shopping.
If the point of Gran Turismo is to reflect the more realistic side of racing, then that makes sense.
I'm okay with microtransactions.
I think in certain types of games and certain ways that it's used, it's actually pretty cool.
For instance, new songs in DDR and Karaoke Revolution and those games.
New maps and shooter games like Halo 2.
In fact, I really like the way Halo 2 did it where for a while it was pay and then it was free.
But of course, I'm going to love anything that's free.
I think it's good for new tracks and things.
For me, it's about when I buy the initial game,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
because they knew right away that there's going to be lots of microtransactions but you do not need to buy them to be able to enjoy the game the way they're making Gran Turismo HD sound oh by the way if you want to play online you've got to buy the cars first so that's kind of fucked up I think right there so why am I buying this game again and to be honest I've seen the video of Gran Turismo HD apparently the premium one or whatever I'm not impressed by it at all and I think
I think it would be a waste of money to buy it.
But you know what?
If you're a huge fan of Gran Turismo, then yeah, go ahead and purchase that game.
But I think it's a mistake to expect you to purchase cars before you can race online.
I think that's dumb.
I think that you should be able to have a sponsor on your car.
And then you don't have to pay.
Your sponsor pays for your purchase.
And free advertising.
That is retarded.
I think Joystick reviewed it at X06 and didn't exactly have the brightest things to say about that, which is a little disappointing.
I liked it when I played it at E3, but it's going to come down to what am I going to get for the base price.
I'm not going to buy the game just to have to microtransaction it out to really get the full feel out of it.
Well, to move on to our next email unless we've got anything more to add.
Not really.
Oh wait, here's one interesting chat comment.
Bandit says, what if you could earn real life gas for your car by winning races in Turismo?
Not likely.
Not likely, but it would be an interesting tie-in.
See, I think what they should do if they really want to have realism in the game is that you actually earn actual, well not actual, but like comparable money in their game environment and have to pay for your gas and pay your crew and
and pay to buy your new stuff.
That should be how they do it.
One more quick chat comment and then we'll let DarkSakura get to the next email.
FootyMonster says, If the game is going to be gimped because you don't have the extra content, then that's wrong.
What you got off the shelves should be enough to enjoy.
I agree.
And also I'd like to give FootyMonster a big hello for listening in from Argentina.
We love our worldwide audience.
Absolutely.
We love our domestic audience too, but we love the worldwide audience as well.
Our next one comes from Matt.
Hey ORL Long time listener to your great podcast, but this is my first time writing in.
I just got done writing Xbox about how disappointed I was when I attempted playing Uno for the first time since they added that god awful contraption called The Vision.
Never have I been so appalled.
If seeing underage boys showing their wee and masturbating wasn't enough, I actually saw this one guy shooting up an unknown drug.
Why is Microsoft allowing this behavior to happen?
It's really discrediting them as a serious game platform anymore.
I guess with Sony's and Microsoft's recent bad management decisions, I guess I'll have to trade in my Xbox 360 and pre-order the only Wii that I want to see and play with, Nintendo's new system.
At least I know that they wouldn't allow this type of behavior to happen on their network.
Please let me know what you guys think of this.
Thanks and keep up the great work.
For whenever there is a camera peripheral, you can better believe you're going to see someone naked.
That is just the fact.
That's nothing that they have control over.
I don't want to see some freaking 16 or 17-year-old person running around naked on their camera.
That's illegal.
Hello?
That's not okay.
That's non-consensual.
I'm being raped with these images.
Here's the other thing, too.
Here's what they should have.
They should have an option for each player, if you do not want to view that, that you can shut the window off.
Don't they?
I'm not sure.
I don't have the camera still, so you've got to tell me.
I don't know.
I've only played Uno once on live with the camera.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Johnny, why did you get banned from Xbox Live?
I don't know.
Eddie says it's probably in the parental controls.
Also, Actdeft says, I can star rate you and I'm not afraid to use it.
You know what, though?
I still think it makes Uno edgier.
It makes me want to play it more because of the naked chicks.
But they're, that's gross because some of them are like 16 and 17.
What are you going to do?
Ask each one, you know, when they're about to take their top off?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yay, team.
Sure I am.
Continue.
I don't,
You know, I don't know.
Come on!
There's a difference between someone flashing their butt really quick and someone jerking it off on camera.
That's disgusting.
If I want to see that, there's websites I can go to for that.
Microsoft does not care.
Transcontroller?
You know, maybe our particular emailer here has just been lucky, quote-unquote, in what they've been seeing.
Wonderdog Harold in our chatroom says, I've been playing tons of Uno, and I haven't seen anything obscene.
Exactly.
Well, I played one game of Uno, and that wasn't obscene.
I've seen, like, one person using a camera, and that's it.
I think it's funny when I see cameras, because usually they're pointing at really weird things, like someone's cat.
You know, just, like, fun stuff.
Dude, we should put Shermie on the camera.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Do the ultra-warn thing that notifies Microsoft.
That's not cool.
And why are people just leaving the games and stuff?
If you see some pre-teen masturbating on camera, why are people kicking them out of the game or just saying, fuck this, I'm out of here?
I guess that's one option.
Host your own games.
Look, boobies.
That's a good option.
Host your own games, and then you have control over booting people out when they're doing something stupid.
So, things to think about.
We got an email from Bradley, who...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but what's coming out with it is that Chain of Memories remake for the PS2 which we may not get there's a petition going around now at khinsider.com the link there will say KH2FM plus COM petition contact campaign just wanting to get the Chain of Memories remake released out here
Just showing interest to Sony, to Squeenix actually, that gamers in the U.S.
wants it.
So that's that I'd make a mention.
Maybe it's something they could pack in with Kingdom Hearts 3 in the future?
I don't know.
A stretch?
I don't know.
I think they should do like a $20 release and say, here you go, here's Chain of Memories.
Oh, like when they release it as a budget game?
Maybe throw that in as a pack-in?
Not necessarily that.
I'm just saying maybe release it as a standalone budget game.
That would be cool.
I would pay for it.
I've been playing Chain of Memories on my micro.
I'd be interested to see.
Chain of Memories is a pain in the ass to play on the micro, by the way.
I'll be honest.
I haven't really played Chain of Memories at all.
I kind of skipped it, but I would check it out.
I don't do a lot of gaming on Game Boy Advance, especially games of that length.
I don't know.
They're just more TV games for me, so I would definitely check it out if it was on PlayStation 2.
So I'd like to see that.
I'll sign it.
I'd just probably import it, but that's me.
You know me.
Got one from JeremyTodd1.
Hi.
Hey, OLR, it's JeremyTodd1, like I just said.
I haven't sent an email in for a while, so why don't I send one now?
I don't know why don't you?
He's been getting a lot of FaceTime tonight with the comments and everything, but that's fine.
Did you ever think that Microsoft and the makers of the games is ripping us off with the arcade games?
MSN BAH
and yes, I know I'm a sucker because I keep buying these games.
My name is JeremyTodd1 and I have a problem.
Yeah, but could you see your friend masturbating and shooting up drugs on MSN Messenger?
I think not.
That's a plus.
No, seriously, um,
You know, it's the same.
You can play Zuma for free online.
You can play Bejeweled for free online.
Yeah, we're suckers for these games anyway.
They're pretty on the TV in a way that they're not in the little window in the computer.
And there's something to be said about the achievements and voice chat, multiplayer, and all that crap.
I don't know.
We are suckers.
But five bucks isn't that much either.
It's really not.
I could buy groceries with that!
Crackers and sardines for a week!
Yeah, you could buy, like, two boxes of Hot Pockets.
That's about it.
Mmm, Hot Pocket.
Okay, two emails left.
One's from Steven NZ.
Hey everyone, love the show like always, and before I start, I know that my grammar is...
Not up to scratch, lol.
Oh, wait, hold on.
Can I say this one comment on the last email real quick?
No, that's fine.
This is good.
BootyMonster says, Sky, it just makes it more accessible for everyone in the house.
Interesting perspective.
I just want to say that.
I was joking.
To continue, I just wanted to ask you guys which is better, out of a plasma or LCD TV for gaming?
And we'll go ahead and ask that first question.
I have an LCD widescreen, and I like it.
Plasma does have...
Well, especially from having dealt with plasma monitors for Beatmania.
They did sort of die after a while of constant use.
I was going to get into this in the FUs of the week.
I had a, I think it's CRT, is that what they call the big boxes?
I had a CRT, but I was forced to upgrade this week and I now have an LCD.
It's pretty.
I like LCDs.
I'm getting used to it still.
The sound is bothering me on this new TV, though.
I can't get it just right like I had on the old one, so that's the only thing that's bothering me.
But the picture's pretty.
It's pretty.
Loki, what about you?
What do you have?
You have an LCD, right?
I have an LCD.
Actually, to go ahead and continue, and this next question is probably more for Loki, but I was wondering how long it would take for a stationary image to burn into an HDMI plasma screen as I don't want to damage my new TV.
I don't think plasmas have the problem with burn-in anymore.
Um,
Not if you get a new one.
I remember the older ones having issues with it.
Yeah, I don't think it's really an issue anymore.
But apparently pretty quick from what I heard before.
But I don't think, like I said, I think they've fixed that now.
You know what I don't get, and I'll probably have some tech junkie sending me hate mail over this, but oh well.
Projection televisions.
I don't like those at all.
Like the ones that look weird if you're looking at it too high or too low, they don't look right.
I don't get those TVs at all.
I would never put one of those in my house.
I'm sure that's going to incite some hate mail.
I'm not a fan, personally.
That's an opinion, people.
Although I have to say, I saw my first non-video game example of Burnin' yesterday.
I went to the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum in San Francisco and one of their screens had Major Burnin'.
Because they play the same thing over and over about blowing your cheeks up like Dizzy Gillespie.
To continue with email, I'm just all over the place today.
Last one comes from DMN.
Yes, we saved you for last.
Pet, pet.
All the same people managing to get on this show in different ways.
Calls, chats, emails.
Well, you know, if you're sitting at home going, why do all these people keep getting on the show?
Well, you know, you could send us an email and you could get on the show.
Just make sure it's intelligent.
Absolutely.
Hey, OLR.
It's always great to be able to listen to you guys.
I appreciate the opinions.
To which I generally agree with you guys upon, keep up the good work.
I do write, however, regarding Sony.
I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but in the past two console generations, we can all agree that Sony has prevailed over the other competitors, PS1 over the N64 and Saturn.
Not in Japan, necessarily, though.
PS2 over the GameCube and Xbox and Dreamcast.
This reminds me a lot of Nintendo back in the 80s and 90s when they dominated with the NES and Super NES.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for gaming with the 64.
Nintendo reeled from that blow for quite a while and are now taking a step in the right direction and being innovative.
Mind, I bash Sony a lot, but I do not want to see them fail.
I love the PS1 as well as the PS2, but I think that the fact that the two console generations of success have gone to their heads and going to send them further downhill.
And the problem with that is that if the PS3 fails, Blu-ray is likely to, and Sony will have nothing back to fall on.
I hope...
Hirai, Stringer, and Kuragi strongly think about their business plan for the PS3 because it might be the last thing that Sony ever does.
Thanks for reading and keep up the good work.
It's an interesting comparison to make, but the one problem I have with it is that the PSP is no Virtual Boy.
I think the PSP is a much better system than the Virtual Boy was.
The Virtual Boy just had some fundamental problems with it.
The PSP is just kind of a different thing.
It's games and movies and music.
Remember, Kutaragi eats crayons and wears a helmet.
Was that the last email?
That was it.
Alright, then you could send us some emails as well.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com More news while we're running along this segment.
We still have DDR previews to get to, so let's run through the next bit of news.
Yes, and I'm sure this came as a first for everybody that heard it, but apparently there was a press release done by Bethesda saying, guess what?
Elder Scrolls Oblivion is coming out on the PSP and PS3.
Okay.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and also that the date would be April 07.
We mentioned that back on episode 196?
Yeah, okay.
Yes, but we cannot confirm those rumors until it's on the cover of our magazine.
Yeah, exactly.
Once it gets printed in the official PlayStation magazine, thank you very much, 1up.com, which I might add, there is an article in OPM that says, if any game is worth the price of a PlayStation 3, Oblivion is it.
Hey!
If you want to buy us out of our day jobs, sure.
I have editorial experience and writing.
Again, if you want to buy us out of our day jobs, sure.
Hi, Jamie's in college for this.
Like I said earlier in the show, and I'm going to repeat this every single episode until this actual story comes out somewhere else.
Fall Auto 2 on PSP in March.
You heard it here first.
You've got issues, Loki.
well as also in regards to people who have issues as I mentioned we all know Kutaragi eats crayons licks wall candy wears a bicycle helmet now he has earned himself a leash yes he has to be strapped to the playground so that he does not run off when he was asked if the rival consoles will outstrip Sony's PS3 Kutaragi said we do not care
He did, though, admit that they are struggling with the Blu-ray drive production, but they're wanting to resolve it.
Now, I have to say, though, that Phil Harrison, I think that he also has issues with crayons.
He at least eats the wrappers on the crayons, because when he was asked if they have a launch lineup yet, to quote, we're at a fluid time when games are in Final QA, but not out of Final QA, but we're close.
So, in other words, no.
Just say no.
Just say no.
You don't have to give the special boy answer.
Go back and eat your... We should just send Kutaragi and Harrison, like, some Crayolas.
Do you want to?
Yeah.
Orange ones.
Okay, let's figure out their address or whatever.
We'll send them some.
Here's some Crayons for you to eat.
We think you ran out.
Oh, God.
Stupid, stupid Sony.
I don't think he would get it.
I think he's too dumb for that stuff.
They just make you Crayons.
Anyways.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Speaking of hacks and leaks, it's being said that Gears of War has been pirated and uploaded to Usenet.
It's 7.2 gigs and 157 parts.
It will take a long time to download.
The thing is, it takes so long to download that nobody really knows if this is legitimate or not.
It could be a bunch of crap.
But certainly interesting that this would have already hit the internet when the game is not supposed to be out for a month.
Uh-oh, that could be bad.
I don't think it's legit.
from what I've heard so far.
Could be a beta build or something.
And to be honest, 7.2 gigs, that doesn't take that long to download on Usenet.
Not that I would know or anything.
Sorry, I got the giggles there for a second.
Anyways, some interesting stuff though.
Tetsuya Mizuguchi Tetsuya Mizuguchi
New things with new technology.
So, possibly a new Rez game on next-gen console.
Vibrator 2.0.
That would be pretty sweet.
I'm looking forward to it.
I mean, I would like a trans... Hi!
Look, the ferret.
Interesting comment in chatroom from FootyMonster in regards to the Gears of War piracy story.
It has happened before, Skye.
Shenmue 2 on Dreamcast was four CDs and got leaked three weeks before the release date.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Alright, well that's going to do it for the news here in this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we have some more exciting stuff to get to, and that would be our DDR previews.
That's right, for the past few weeks we've been premiering new tracks from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4, as well as DDR Universe.
Going to be coming out for the Xbox and the Xbox 360 a little later this year.
D.D.R.
Ultramix 4
of Beyond Here and Now here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Power Previews.
and more.
Thanks for watching!
Here on the DDR Sneak Peek set as Naropa with Beyond Here and Now.
Now that is the full version we just played for you guys.
Keep in mind when that song actually shows up in DDR, it'll be cut down to the typical DDR length of about a minute and a half, two minutes, whatever they decide on.
But I love the 80s-ness of that song.
And somebody in the chatroom had the balls to say that song was too 80s.
And I say you can never have enough 80s.
And Standing Still in Time was kind of one of my favorite sleeper songs in Ultramix 2.
A lot of people didn't talk about that song, but it was still one of my favorites to play, so
I'm looking forward to seeing how that one turns out in the final mix of the game.
by one of the familiar faces from Konami of Japan.
So I bet you guys are going to get a kick out of this.
Here's the next song in our DDR sneak peeks from DDR Ultramix 4.
This is Jondi and Spech with Insaner, the LEDs punishment mix.
That's right, I said LED here on the sneak peeks.
Enjoy.
and any home star with mechanical failings.
Insaner, that's LED's punishment mix by Jondi and Spech here on the DDR Sneak Peeks.
Boy, that step chart's going to be a killer, you think?
You think that step chart might just make you die?
Yeah, it'll be a little tough.
But that's a great song.
As folks in the chatroom are saying, it's Strong Jaeger plus Insaner, so that should be kind of interesting.
It's very LED.
Alright, let's get to another Johnny and Spesh track because that's what we've got lined up for you next.
It's another song from DDR Universe.
This song is called Loops.
Enjoy this one here on the DDR Sneak Peeks.
Loops
Let's do it again!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and many more.
That is Loops by John D. and Spesh coming soon to DDR Universe here on the DDR Sneak Peaks Orange Lounge Radio.
We've got one more song for you guys tonight, and it's a song that comes to you from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4.
It's by an artist named Richard Devine, or maybe that's Devin?
No, I think it's Devine.
And the song is called Sig Rev 2.
That's right, S-I-G-R-E-V 2.
Just run that all together, and that's the name of the song.
So check it out here on the DDR Sneak Peaks.
and SigRev2 here on the DDR Sneak Peeks and that's going to do it for this week.
That was an interesting song.
Kind of sounds like old school beat mania.
That's what you were saying in the chair, huh?
Yeah, what I just said is that it's like Paranoia meets Overdozer.
Yeah?
As in the...
Thank you for watching!
So it should be some fun mixes coming out later this year.
All right.
Now, instead of actually going to break right now, we actually had some last-minute stories we wanted to add here into Part A. A little behind-the-scenes look at Orange Lounge Radio.
Every Sunday, we usually compile all the blogs that we've seen and all the stories that we want to do.
We compile it into this big list that we call our show role, and usually it's pretty much set in stone, and we don't mess with it too much, but...
DarkSakura, Doki Doki Majo Saiban
which is a game where you look for witches hiding on the earth.
And the way that you find out who is a witch and who is not a witch is you touch them in special locations.
The image from... I'll link the blog in the chat room that there's a lot of images posted on.
But it has pictures of boobs with X marks on them so they didn't find a witch there.
It's like... I'm getting...
The little Monty Python fangirl in my head is going, how do you know she's a witch?
She's just like one!
We have Fireboma in chat going, and then you burn them!
Ah, but what do you burn apart from witches?
More witches!
Build a bridge out of her!
Yeah.
We've already got a chair room going off on it.
But that's my impression, except, like, porn game?
So a porn game involving witches?
It's not, it's just, it's like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
To make a long story short, I was going on, I wanted to see if the show was posted actually, and I pull up my star page's Yahoo.
And what do I see in the bottom corner?
They do this like top ten list or whatever, and it said top ten video game downloads.
And the little picture representing it was porn.
And I was like, huh?
That's weird.
So what did I do?
I took a screen cap of it.
Of course, later on, about three hours later, they figured out that they're
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Vagina out there in the open and flapping in the wind flapping in the wind and I do have the picture I could and you swear you didn't photoshop this I swear to god I did not photoshop this at all I just use a screen cap program I have the actual web page saved to my computer just you know to make sure but it was hilarious Bandit says in our chat room says yeah I'll believe it when 1up.com reports on it
Link, Link, Link Please, Link Please, Link Or It Didn't Happen
We have a listless coming your way.
If you haven't heard that segment yet, have no idea what we're talking about, stay tuned.
We'll be back in a little bit with Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
