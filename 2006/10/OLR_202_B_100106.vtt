Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

00:04.760 --> 00:05.760
twice weekly.

00:05.760 --> 00:12.240
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links

00:12.240 --> 00:15.480
to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.540
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.540 --> 00:25.920
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 202 for this October

00:25.920 --> 00:28.280
1st of 2006.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.160
I can't believe the year is almost over at this point.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.160
It's crazy.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.160
Seriously.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.160
Time just flies by.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.160
Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.640
Loki, why don't you start us off.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.960
Yes, let's start us off with the Zune.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.960
The Zune, it sounds like Lune.

00:43.960 --> 00:51.320
But anyways, Microsoft's brand new MP3 movie, you name it, player.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.960
They announced some details at X06 about how exactly it's going to work and some of the

00:54.960 --> 00:55.960
online things.

00:55.960 --> 01:02.120
The 30GB version of the Zune will be sold for $249.99 when they're on sale November

01:02.120 --> 01:04.920
14th in the United States.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.760
The price of music is in two choices.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.000
You can either buy a monthly pass for 99 cents, which will give you hearing access to all

01:12.000 --> 01:16.040
these songs in the Zune marketplace.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.040
But there is a catch.

01:17.040 --> 01:22.360
You will not be able to listen to the songs once the pass has expired.

01:22.360 --> 01:28.200
If you want to permanently buy any song, you can make it yours by spending 79 Microsoft

01:28.200 --> 01:29.200
points.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
That's right.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.880
The same Microsoft points you would be buying Doom on Xbox Live Arcade, you can be spending

01:33.880 --> 01:34.880
on music.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.320
And of course, 79 points is roughly about 99 cents.

01:39.320 --> 01:43.440
So you can either purchase the song for 99 cents or you can pay, I guess, a monthly fee

01:43.440 --> 01:45.360
and listen to all the music for 99 cents.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.000
But you probably have to download it each time.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.800
So it's kind of interesting.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.740
Kind of an interesting way to conduct business.

01:51.740 --> 01:54.920
Pretty soon I'll be paying my rent in Microsoft points.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.080
Kind of sad.

01:57.080 --> 02:01.040
That honestly is a bit on the sad side.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.480
I honestly, you know, I've had this sort of image though that the way the future is going

02:05.480 --> 02:07.160
to go is going to use some sort of electronic.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.480
We're already on credit cards, you know.

02:09.480 --> 02:10.480
We can buy things online.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.920
Man, debit and all that stuff, we're practically there.

02:12.920 --> 02:17.840
It'll be like Demolition Man where they scan the barcode in our hand and we have credits

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
and if you cuss...

02:18.840 --> 02:20.280
I hope not because that was kind of a crap movie.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.280
Well, actually, ironically enough...

02:21.280 --> 02:22.280
I love that movie.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.600
I was watching this thing on the Discovery Channel.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
They were talking about Wired.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.800
It's like they have Next Fest or something like that where they're showing off, you know,

02:27.800 --> 02:28.800
brand new technology.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.440
Kind of like, I guess, CES or something like that.

02:31.440 --> 02:36.480
But anyways, one of the technologies that they were showing off was a thumbprint scanner.

02:36.480 --> 02:41.360
It's basically a thumbprint scanner and then you enter in your phone number and you'll

02:41.360 --> 02:45.860
deduct, you know, money from your checking or savings account just using your thumbprint.

02:45.860 --> 02:48.200
So that's pretty much going to be like the wave of the future.

02:48.200 --> 02:53.480
We also have this thing where they have a chip stored in a fake tooth that's fireproof,

02:53.480 --> 02:56.140
you know, bashproof pretty much.

02:56.140 --> 03:01.900
So that if you were to be horribly, say, horribly burned in a fire, they can still identify

03:01.900 --> 03:03.500
your remains without DNA testing.

03:03.500 --> 03:07.240
You've got your tooth there with your medical records and all your information.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.400
Without having to play, let's name the burn victim!

03:10.400 --> 03:12.960
Well, to get back into gaming news...

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
Yes, please.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.720
Now, keep in mind, I was a big tech TV fangirl.

03:17.720 --> 03:24.320
For fans of Saint's Row, there is a thing called the Thunky Fresh Pack, yeah.

03:24.320 --> 03:29.960
It's 100 Microsoft points and it has clothes, tattoos, hairstyles.

03:29.960 --> 03:35.120
For use in single and multiplayer modes, you've also got tiger striped underwear, bunny slippers,

03:35.120 --> 03:41.560
an eye patch, and a samurai helmet, medallions, and rattlesnake tattoos.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.820
Gee, do I spend the 100 points to buy this crap or should I get a copy of London Bridge

03:46.820 --> 03:47.820
for my Zune?

03:47.820 --> 03:49.840
I just don't know.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.840
I think...

03:50.840 --> 03:53.600
Some people like the customization.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.240
And some people like Fergie.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.120
Oh my god, I had to listen to that CD yesterday.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.600
My character has a pimp hat now and his dress is in really nice clothes.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.960
All purple, of course, because I've got to represent Saint's Row colors in order to get

04:06.960 --> 04:15.080
the more, I guess, points for missions and stuff.

04:15.080 --> 04:18.240
This was kind of like the same thing we were talking about a while back, which was rumored

04:18.240 --> 04:23.720
to be coming to the kiosk at GameStop for free.

04:23.720 --> 04:28.200
I wish it was coming to the GameStop kiosk for free because I'd rather pick it up there.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.200
Who knows?

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
Maybe it still will.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
I hope so.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.200
Some of them pay for this.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.440
Well, I like free things and Midway is giving away some free things right now, namely some

04:36.440 --> 04:41.800
online Flash playable copies of some of their arcade treasures.

04:41.800 --> 04:48.560
You can play Bubbles, Defender 1 and 2, Joust, Rampage, Robotron 2084, which is Microsoft

04:48.560 --> 04:55.000
Points on Xbox 360, Satan's Hollow, Sinistar, Spy Hunter, and Tapper.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.160
Yes, you can play those all online on Midway's website.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.760
Right now, if you want, it's MidwayArcade.com.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.760
So who needs Midway arcade treasures, huh?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.320
You got all that available for you.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.320
Enjoy.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.320
Exactly.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.320
And you know what?

05:08.320 --> 05:11.520
You've got to save money for those PlayStation 3 games, of course.

05:11.520 --> 05:16.920
And as we mentioned earlier, they are going to be retailing for about $59.99 for the most

05:16.920 --> 05:18.940
part, which is expected.

05:18.940 --> 05:26.960
Most current gen games are peaking out about $49.99, most actually which are $39.99 now.

05:26.960 --> 05:34.060
And now the next gen games are going to try to be getting $59.99 retail for most everything.

05:34.060 --> 05:43.520
This is pretty much confirmed by sites like Sony style and whatnot.

05:43.520 --> 05:50.240
Some games might not be $59.99 like Gran Turismo HD.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.640
It's not a surprise, I would say.

05:52.640 --> 05:57.800
But I'm still waiting for those companies out there to get greedy and start charging

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
more.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.440
As long as those $70 and $80 rumors don't come true.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.760
To be honest, though, I don't think they are because if anything, they'll try to nickel

06:04.760 --> 06:07.960
and dime you on the backend with their online content.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.080
That's what it's going to end up being.

06:10.080 --> 06:17.320
Instead of charging $70, they can charge $900 and charge $50 for the game or something.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.320
Alright.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.320
Jamie.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.320
What?

06:20.320 --> 06:21.320
Jamie.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.320
What?

06:22.320 --> 06:23.320
Jamie.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
Jamie.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Bob.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.320
Jamie.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.320
Bob.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.320
Bob.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.320
Bob.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.320
Bob.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.320
Okay.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.320
So we got Kayla.

06:32.320 --> 06:40.020
Kayla WWE,

06:40.020 --> 06:48.020
On the sixth, we have Barnyard for a bunch of stuff.

06:48.020 --> 06:51.020
We have Capcom Puzzle World on PSP.

06:51.020 --> 06:53.020
Heroes of Annihilated Empires on the PC.

06:53.020 --> 06:56.020
Import Tuner Challenge on Xbox 360.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.020
Mage Knight Apocalypse on PC.

06:58.020 --> 07:01.020
The Nintendo DS browser on the PSP.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.020
I'm sorry, the DS.

07:03.020 --> 07:06.020
That was a bad joke.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.020
Wah wah.

07:08.020 --> 07:11.020
Open Season coming out on damn near everything.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.020
Put out by Ubisoft.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.020
Wild Arms 4 on PlayStation 2.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.020
I have to say the Wild Arms series is a good game.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.020
I have a friend who is absolutely addicted to that game.

07:20.020 --> 07:23.020
Wild Arms 4 is good.

07:23.020 --> 07:26.020
Did Wild Arms Ultra F ever come out over there?

07:26.020 --> 07:28.020
Not a series I played.

07:28.020 --> 07:30.020
Hey guys, let me know if it ever came out.

07:30.020 --> 07:36.020
A few things coming up though in the month to look forward to is Power Stone collection for PSP.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.020
English training, have fun improving your skills on the DS.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.020
That's actually pretty funny.

07:42.020 --> 07:46.020
Resident Evil 4 Platinum, Sims 2 Pets coming out.

07:46.020 --> 07:55.020
They're getting Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Budokai 2 and Metal Slug Anthology.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.020
That's pretty cool.

07:56.020 --> 07:59.020
The US isn't going to see too much this week.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.020
There are some pretty good games there.

08:01.020 --> 08:06.020
FIFA Soccer 07 if you're a soccer fan coming out in almost every single system.

08:06.020 --> 08:10.020
You do have also Star Trek Encounters coming out on the PlayStation 2.

08:10.020 --> 08:13.020
A great Star Trek combat game.

08:13.020 --> 08:16.020
Very cheap, $19.99.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.020
So check it out if you can.

08:18.020 --> 08:21.020
I think actually it might even be $14.99.

08:21.020 --> 08:23.020
I know it's very cheap, but that's all I know.

08:23.020 --> 08:29.020
Anyways, another crappy game, Snow Cross 2 featuring Air Blur Morgan.

08:29.020 --> 08:35.020
And by the way, this game has been delayed for a year, so it's crap.

08:35.020 --> 08:40.020
Let's see, Mercury Meltdown for the PSP, which is equal for the first Mercury game.

08:40.020 --> 08:44.020
And I don't know if this is worth your money, but if you want, pick it up.

08:44.020 --> 08:48.020
Gangs of London, definitely a better game for the PSP.

08:48.020 --> 08:55.020
Also on the PC we have El Matador and Paparazzi.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.020
So that's some interesting stuff.

08:57.020 --> 09:01.020
How could I not forget Scarface, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

09:01.020 --> 09:07.020
Now a lot of places are reporting that this is the 8th of October, but it's actually the 5th.

09:07.020 --> 09:13.020
It has a soft street date on it, so stores will be getting it on the 5th, but they cannot advertise it until the 8th.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.020
So weird.

09:15.020 --> 09:20.020
Go bug your GameStops, because that's probably the game you're going to want that week.

09:20.020 --> 09:23.020
Alright, well over in Japan we have some release dates for the week.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.020
Honestly, not a whole lot coming out this week.

09:25.020 --> 09:28.020
It's kind of a slow week over there as well.

09:28.020 --> 09:34.020
NBA Live 07 and FIFA Soccer 07 both coming out this week.

09:34.020 --> 09:41.020
Shinobido Imashime, also known as Spike the Best, is coming out over there this week as well.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.020
And Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is coming out this week.

09:45.020 --> 09:49.020
Front Mission 5 in the Ultimate Hits Collection, hit stores this week in Japan as well.

09:49.020 --> 09:58.020
And for you music game fans who have about $250 to spare, you can get your Guitar Freaks ASC arcade-style controller this week.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.020
That's awesome.

10:00.020 --> 10:11.020
Well, as far as other releases for the UK going back to them, they're actually, for fans who are football nuts,

10:11.020 --> 10:20.020
there's Pro Evolution Soccer 6 coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC on 27th October, of course out by Konami.

10:20.020 --> 10:25.020
PSP and DS versions will be coming.

10:25.020 --> 10:34.020
They're actually stating that the 360 version is going to be noticeably improved.

10:34.020 --> 10:44.020
The AI anyway is. They actually specifically named it in areas like the AI players running into space.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.020
That's not going to happen.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.020
It also runs in high definition and widescreen.

10:48.020 --> 11:01.020
It will also feature new licensed clubs, including Manchester United, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, and Olympiasos.

11:01.020 --> 11:11.020
New kits and squads for Czech, French, Australian, English, Italian, Argentinian, Spanish, and Swedish National.

11:11.020 --> 11:15.020
I know we've got some football fans listening.

11:15.020 --> 11:25.020
Some other things you might be able to look forward to on the next-gen consoles, other than football, would be Castlevania.

11:25.020 --> 11:33.020
More Castlevania games are on the way, including more 2D Castlevania games, Promises, Koji, and Higurashi.

11:33.020 --> 11:40.020
Now, of course, Xbox Live Arcade will be seeing Symphony of the Night at some point, as they've announced previously,

11:40.020 --> 11:48.020
but we might see even maybe the original Castlevania, Simon's Quest, 3, who knows?

11:48.020 --> 11:59.020
From the sounds of it, he says, I hope more people will enjoy 2D Castlevania experience as a result of it, talking about the three systems succeeding.

11:59.020 --> 12:02.020
He thinks all three of them are going to do well.

12:02.020 --> 12:12.020
Basically, he's up for doing more 2D Castlevania, so maybe we'll see some exclusive stuff on the next-gen marketplaces.

12:12.020 --> 12:20.020
Please, some more 2D Castlevania, or you can do that subtle hints of 3D, kind of like if you look at Symphony of the Night.

12:20.020 --> 12:26.020
Just make a real grand 2D Castlevania for the next-gen. It would be awesome.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.020
Just because you're next-gen doesn't mean everything has to be 3D.

12:29.020 --> 12:35.020
Look at a game like Viewtiful Joe. It was a great 2D using next-gen graphics.

12:35.020 --> 12:40.020
Anyway, if you still want to live in the current generation, well, this might be the controller for you.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.020
This is a controller that would be great for throwing against the wall.

12:43.020 --> 12:50.020
Everybody has a friend like this, somebody who gets so frustrated, or maybe a sibling, that they throw the controller against the wall,

12:50.020 --> 12:53.020
or they throw it at people when they get really frustrated with the game.

12:53.020 --> 12:57.020
Well, now you have a Nerf controller.

12:57.020 --> 13:00.020
That's right, there's a PlayStation 2 controller that's covered in Nerf.

13:00.020 --> 13:07.020
It's like this bluish color here, and it's coming out for the PlayStation 2, and it's wireless.

13:07.020 --> 13:13.020
It comes in black, blue, red, or orange. It'll be about $30, and comes out in November of 2006.

13:13.020 --> 13:17.020
That's right, the official Nerf controller, perfect for throwing around, although I wouldn't recommend it.

13:17.020 --> 13:19.020
You could still break the damn thing.

13:19.020 --> 13:21.020
Or somebody.

13:21.020 --> 13:28.020
It's still kind of heavy. Just because it's Nerf-made doesn't mean it's safe to chuck at people's heads, but it at least would hurt a lot less.

13:28.020 --> 13:38.020
Speaking about breaking people, there was the Uwe Boll boxing matches going on recently, and as expected, you know,

13:38.020 --> 13:41.020
nothing's going to be fair when it comes down to Uwe Boll.

13:41.020 --> 13:51.020
In fact, Richard Lotak-Kanka was one of the people from Something Awful to actually be able to fight in this,

13:51.020 --> 13:57.020
and he kind of gave a little bit of a background to these whole boxing matches.

13:57.020 --> 14:04.020
Apparently, they were supposed to be a PR stunt, which is, you know, pretty obvious, and all the punches were supposed to be kind of fake.

14:04.020 --> 14:07.020
Also, that they were supposed to be given training.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.020
So it was supposed to be like wrestling.

14:09.020 --> 14:15.020
Pretty much. And it was supposed to be, you know, they were supposed to be given training beforehand.

14:15.020 --> 14:22.020
So, you know, there were going to be five contenders, but apparently one of them had to be pulled out of the competition

14:22.020 --> 14:26.020
because he had a boxing background, and Uwe Boll wasn't like a fair fight.

14:26.020 --> 14:36.020
So out of the four people, including one 17-year-old, everyone, you know, pretty much got beat the crap out of.

14:36.020 --> 14:39.020
Is that legal, to beat the crap out of a 17-year-old like that?

14:39.020 --> 14:42.020
Well, I guess it was Canada. Maybe the laws are different there. I don't know.

14:42.020 --> 14:45.020
I guess he signed a waiver. Maybe the parents signed a waiver as well.

14:45.020 --> 14:48.020
Video's out there on YouTube, so check it out.

14:48.020 --> 14:58.020
To be honest, I don't know, you know, Richard Lotax, or Lotax from Something Awful,

14:58.020 --> 15:04.020
his whole thing is, you know, he didn't really hate Uwe Boll before this whole thing, and now he does.

15:04.020 --> 15:07.020
He thinks he's a douche, basically.

15:07.020 --> 15:11.020
Wonder Dog Harold sums it up in our chat room and says, Uwe Boll is such a pig fucker.

15:11.020 --> 15:14.020
It doesn't matter. Okay, big deal. So you beat up some critics.

15:14.020 --> 15:20.020
Ooh, you beat up critics that had no boxing training, and one person that actually might give you some competition,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.020
you pussied out, you fucker.

15:22.020 --> 15:26.020
Didn't one of the critics that came out of this say that, you know, although the fight was kind of a joke,

15:26.020 --> 15:30.020
the new movie's not bad, or something like the clips they saw from the new movie didn't seem that bad?

15:30.020 --> 15:37.020
I don't see how they can mess up, you know, Postal. I mean, that one I'm interested in seeing, actually.

15:37.020 --> 15:42.020
But I think the new movie, In the Name of the King or whatever, that's going to suck donkey balls.

15:42.020 --> 15:46.020
And know what's even worse about it? It's two fucking parts, so it's like four hours long.

15:46.020 --> 15:51.020
No, thank you. I will not be seeing your two crappy-ass halves of movies.

15:51.020 --> 15:52.020
You know what I would pay to see?

15:52.020 --> 15:53.020
What?

15:53.020 --> 15:57.020
Jack Thompson versus Uwe Boll. Seriously, to death.

15:57.020 --> 16:00.020
Why isn't Jack Thompson coming after him for beating up on 17-year-olds?

16:00.020 --> 16:06.020
Because he's too busy trying to involve himself by, oh, God, Roboy linked me to this article.

16:06.020 --> 16:13.020
He's aligning himself with the defense for some cases. It's just a bunch of bullshit.

16:13.020 --> 16:17.020
Well, you'll notice I purposely omitted that from tonight's show role because I didn't want to give him any more attention.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.020
Sorry.

16:18.020 --> 16:25.020
Well, the one thing that I think is worth mentioning for this is that it's probably something to lightly get him disbarred in that state, so let's hope that happens.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.020
Hooray.

16:26.020 --> 16:32.020
Well, God, all this talk of Uwe Boll and Jack Thompson puts me in a foul mood, so you know what that means, right, Dark Sakura?

16:32.020 --> 16:43.020
Hmm.

16:43.020 --> 16:45.020
The FUs of the week, Dark Sakura.

16:45.020 --> 16:51.020
My FU of the week goes primarily, there are some exceptions, to straight men.

16:51.020 --> 17:04.020
Oh, yes. Just because I'm a woman doesn't give you the right to look at me, see me there, and then proceed to back into me and elbow me in the shoulder while trying to take a picture at the wax museum.

17:04.020 --> 17:09.020
And then it doesn't give you permission to just expect me to move out of the way when you're going to open a door.

17:09.020 --> 17:16.020
I paid to be there. You are going to freaking respect my personal space. Fuck you and your cock.

17:16.020 --> 17:17.020
But not literally.

17:17.020 --> 17:18.020
No.

17:18.020 --> 17:25.020
It goes to this whole attitude of, I'm a man, you're a woman, you have to move, you have to do what I say, blah, blah, blah.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.020
Fuck you.

17:26.020 --> 17:29.020
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.020
You know what?

17:31.020 --> 17:36.020
The whole, I hate how, I hope you're not, this isn't towards you.

17:36.020 --> 17:39.020
Well, I'm just saying, how did you know his sexual orientation?

17:39.020 --> 17:41.020
His wife was there.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.020
Does that mean anything?

17:42.020 --> 17:44.020
Trust me.

17:44.020 --> 17:47.020
I have infallible gay dark.

17:47.020 --> 17:58.020
These people, the only way that I think that there would be any remotely gay vibe coming from them is if they were like, you know, bare leather daddies or something.

17:58.020 --> 18:01.020
Which I saw plenty of today.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.020
But no.

18:02.020 --> 18:05.020
All our listeners of the show are accepted from this, fuck you, right?

18:05.020 --> 18:06.020
Yeah.

18:06.020 --> 18:07.020
Yes, yes.

18:07.020 --> 18:13.020
But I hate, especially, I hate the whole, the flock of testosterone.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.020
You know what I mean?

18:14.020 --> 18:26.020
When you get, like, I guess the football man where it's like, we're going to drink beer and go hooters.

18:26.020 --> 18:33.020
We're going to, to quote Margaret Cho, we're going to order titties with wet dressing and celery sticks.

18:33.020 --> 18:37.020
That's just, okay.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.020
All right.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.020
No, no, no.

18:39.020 --> 18:47.020
Like I said, this is not centered toward all straight men, this is just centered toward stupid straight men.

18:47.020 --> 18:52.020
All right, Loki, speaking of stupid straight men, Loki, you know how they actually serve Hooters at Hooter?

18:52.020 --> 18:56.020
That might be worth, you know, the price of admission right there, but not their food size.

18:56.020 --> 19:07.020
You know, actually, ironically enough, fuck you to stupid women drivers who can't fucking pay attention on the road because you're talking to your kids or talking on the cell phone or fucking around with something on your dash.

19:07.020 --> 19:13.020
You know, I know I understand that those complex SUVs that you drive are so, you know, beyond you.

19:13.020 --> 19:21.020
But, you know, could you do us all a favor and stay at home so I don't have to bother, you know, driving behind you because you're too fucking slow or retarded?

19:21.020 --> 19:24.020
Thank you.

19:24.020 --> 19:30.020
You have to remember we have, we have folks all around the world listening and not everyone knows what Hooters is.

19:30.020 --> 19:39.020
Hooters is this, um, eatery where you can order hot wings and that's about all that's decent on the menu and they're not even very good because they taste like vinegar.

19:39.020 --> 19:45.020
And they're served by women, um, wearing really small gym shorts.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.020
Cheerleader outfits, essentially.

19:47.020 --> 19:52.020
Not quite, because they're not little skirts, they're just those uber, they're the shorts that you can see ass cheeks through.

19:52.020 --> 19:59.020
And, and actually I read an article about a girl who went inside on, on Hooters just to try to find out what went on behind the scenes.

19:59.020 --> 20:04.020
They give you, they ask you what your t-shirt size is and they give you one that's two sizes too small.

20:04.020 --> 20:06.020
Lovely.

20:06.020 --> 20:09.020
And basically you're there for boobs.

20:09.020 --> 20:15.020
Which I have no problem with personally, but I hate the whole mentality that spawned it.

20:15.020 --> 20:20.020
And a question from our chat room from someone from abroad who doesn't know better, uh, is there a male version?

20:20.020 --> 20:21.020
There should be.

20:21.020 --> 20:28.020
When I was in high school, one of my people who was in band with me that I used to march next to, she said that they should open a restaurant called Pecker's.

20:28.020 --> 20:32.020
Where it's men in Speedos that wear their aprons backwards.

20:32.020 --> 20:35.020
Did you have any other FUs?

20:35.020 --> 20:43.020
Uh, just actually the Hooters, this is kind of a, you know, an old FU, but FU the Hooters because their service does suck.

20:43.020 --> 20:48.020
I mean, you might go there saying, oh yeah, we're gonna go get served by, you know, hot chicks.

20:48.020 --> 20:55.020
The chicks are dumb and the service is awful and they can't get anything right and it took them like two hours to serve like hot wings.

20:55.020 --> 20:59.020
Which is their staple food at this goddamn place and they can't prepare that even quick enough.

20:59.020 --> 21:05.020
Then they, you know, jump around and dance and stuff and just act obnoxious and annoying the whole time.

21:05.020 --> 21:11.020
It's obviously not worth the trip, so go to a strip club if you really want to eat with boobs around you. Seriously.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.020
What was that one strip club that you said had really good food?

21:14.020 --> 21:15.020
I think it was Centerfolds.

21:15.020 --> 21:16.020
Do you wanna go?

21:16.020 --> 21:18.020
Sure, why not? It'll be fun.

21:18.020 --> 21:25.020
Well, Nellie will want to go. Alright, we'll all go. We'll be at OLR. We'll have a staff meeting at Centerfolds. That'll be fun.

21:25.020 --> 21:26.020
That'll be excellent.

21:26.020 --> 21:29.020
Alright, we'll do that. Our next OLR staff meeting at the titty bar.

21:29.020 --> 21:37.020
Um, let's see, um, my FU of the week goes to Philips, the company that made my last television.

21:37.020 --> 21:42.020
Just over one year after buying the thing, we stopped working.

21:42.020 --> 21:49.020
You would turn on the TV, my nice new high-definition TV, you turn it on, then the image would get really bright and then it would shut off.

21:49.020 --> 21:51.020
And it broke. The damn TV broke.

21:51.020 --> 21:56.020
But thank you to Costco, who's now my favorite store ever. They have the best return policy in the world.

21:56.020 --> 22:01.020
I took the TV back and got a new TV from a different company that hopefully will work for more than a year.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.020
Did it have the red eye of death on it? Like that 360?

22:04.020 --> 22:11.020
No, it did not have the three rings of death on it. It just, it would come up, it would shut off and then that little flashing green light would come on.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.020
Flash, flash, flash, and that's all it would do.

22:13.020 --> 22:16.020
So I'm tempting you, I have power, but I'm not going to work.

22:16.020 --> 22:22.020
Bobby's offering to fly out here for the staff meeting.

22:22.020 --> 22:24.020
You are more than welcome to attend.

22:24.020 --> 22:27.020
We can talk about all games business as well at the meeting.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.020
That would be pretty funny.

22:28.020 --> 22:31.020
You know, that just sounds like it would be lots of fun.

22:31.020 --> 22:32.020
It is fun.

22:32.020 --> 22:38.020
Strippers are nice people. One of my roommates from, actually ex-roommates from college, well, suitemates, she was a stripper.

22:38.020 --> 22:43.020
You know, it is funny, like, you know, people go, but Sky, you're gay, how can you enjoy the titty bar?

22:43.020 --> 22:47.020
Look, the same reason my straight friends end up enjoying the gay bar every time I take them.

22:47.020 --> 22:50.020
You know, I have very few straight friends who complain about the gay bar.

22:50.020 --> 22:54.020
I think it's only fair if I'm, if they're going to go there, I should go to the titty bar.

22:54.020 --> 22:55.020
And it's funny, it's fun.

22:55.020 --> 22:58.020
I complain about the excessive amount of karaoke that's about it.

22:58.020 --> 23:02.020
And I would have to agree though with SSJ100, Matt, I think that was who said it.

23:02.020 --> 23:07.020
Boobs are a lot more sanitary than cock.

23:07.020 --> 23:13.020
Alright, well, we are going back into the news now, and this has absolutely nothing to do...

23:13.020 --> 23:16.020
We're made an adult this time around.

23:16.020 --> 23:19.020
This absolutely has nothing to do with titties, but it is a little foul.

23:19.020 --> 23:24.020
If you ever watch South Park, you know, it's a little bit dirty, but in that way that we all love.

23:24.020 --> 23:31.020
Well, it looks like on South Park's season premiere, they're going to be spoofing World of Warcraft.

23:31.020 --> 23:37.020
And a little 15-second teaser hit the internet this week, and it says the World of Warcraft,

23:37.020 --> 23:40.020
shows the World of Warcraft, and then we hear that all too familiar voice.

23:40.020 --> 23:43.020
Alright, this is it!

23:43.020 --> 23:47.020
I need to play World of Warcraft!

23:47.020 --> 23:49.020
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

23:49.020 --> 23:51.020
Killed faster!

23:51.020 --> 23:55.020
Yes, that's right, this Wednesday on Comedy Central, that should be interesting.

23:55.020 --> 23:58.020
World of Warcraft is going to be hitting South Park.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.020
Yeah, you know, I enjoy South Park.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.020
I've seen quite a few episodes.

24:02.020 --> 24:06.020
It's one of my guilty pleasures, and I'm sure it's going to be hilarious.

24:06.020 --> 24:08.020
You know, they've spoofed games before.

24:08.020 --> 24:15.020
They've spoofed DDR, and they've spoofed the golden PSP.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.020
Remember that whole episode with the Terry Schiavo thing?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.020
Yeah.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.020
Yeah, so they've spoofed stuff before.

24:19.020 --> 24:25.020
So we thought it would be fun to bring back an old favorite segment of ours tonight,

24:25.020 --> 24:27.020
and have a little fun with this topic.

24:27.020 --> 24:30.020
We're going to play Listless.

24:30.020 --> 24:36.020
Alright, the way Listless works is that we're going to come up with the definitive list

24:36.020 --> 24:41.020
of Orange Lounge Radio's top something with whatever category we're doing tonight.

24:41.020 --> 24:44.020
And as a follow-up to this story, the category we're going to do tonight is

24:44.020 --> 24:48.020
game that South Park most needs to make fun of.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.020
Now obviously we can't do World of Warcraft, and we can't do DDR.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.020
Here's the way Listless works.

24:53.020 --> 24:56.020
All of the hosts are going to go around and name their top three,

24:56.020 --> 25:00.020
and then we're going to go around and eliminate one off the list,

25:00.020 --> 25:02.020
so it gets a little vicious in here.

25:02.020 --> 25:04.020
Now usually this game is played with four people,

25:04.020 --> 25:06.020
but since there's only three of us here in studio,

25:06.020 --> 25:10.020
we've asked one of our frequent callers and emailers to join us tonight.

25:10.020 --> 25:12.020
Caller, are you there?

25:12.020 --> 25:14.020
Uh, no.

25:14.020 --> 25:15.020
I guess you must be, smartass.

25:15.020 --> 25:17.020
What's your name? Introduce yourself.

25:17.020 --> 25:18.020
DMN.

25:18.020 --> 25:20.020
Hello, DMN. How you doing?

25:20.020 --> 25:21.020
I'm doing pretty good.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.020
Are you excited to play Listless with us tonight?

25:23.020 --> 25:24.020
Oh, yeah.

25:24.020 --> 25:27.020
It was funny. I asked DMN, I'm like, DMN, you want to play Listless with us tonight?

25:27.020 --> 25:28.020
He's like, what?

25:28.020 --> 25:32.020
I guess we haven't played this game in a while.

25:32.020 --> 25:35.020
Sometimes people recognize it from the little theme song we play,

25:35.020 --> 25:37.020
a little, you know, come on down, come on down.

25:37.020 --> 25:38.020
Anyway, all right, forget it.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.020
Let's get to the list, shall we?

25:39.020 --> 25:41.020
I'll get one dollar.

25:41.020 --> 25:43.020
No, wrong game, DMN.

25:43.020 --> 25:44.020
Wrong game.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.020
We're making a list.

25:45.020 --> 25:48.020
All right, and just for that smartass remark, I'm going to make you go first.

25:48.020 --> 25:53.020
What would be your number three pick for game that South Park most needs to make fun of?

25:53.020 --> 25:54.020
Night Trap.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.020
Night Trap.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.020
Winner.

25:57.020 --> 26:00.020
The old Sega CD game starring Dana Plato.

26:00.020 --> 26:01.020
Oh, yeah.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.020
That's a great one.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.020
Good job.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.020
You're good at this game, DMN.

26:04.020 --> 26:06.020
We'll see if the rest of your list is up to par, though.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.020
But first, well, not yet, not yet.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.020
We've got to go to Loki.

26:09.020 --> 26:11.020
Loki, you're number three.

26:11.020 --> 26:15.020
I would say Grand Theft Auto.

26:15.020 --> 26:17.020
Grand Theft Auto.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.020
Is there a particular one in the series you think it should?

26:19.020 --> 26:20.020
San Andreas.

26:20.020 --> 26:21.020
Because that would be fun.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.020
Okay, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.020
Excellent.

26:23.020 --> 26:25.020
Dark Sakura, what would be your number three?

26:25.020 --> 26:27.020
Karaoke Revolution.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.020
Karaoke Revolution.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.020
Would you like American Idol type style?

26:31.020 --> 26:33.020
That's just what I see happening.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.020
All right, that works.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.020
Oh, by the way, just a quick disclaimer.

26:36.020 --> 26:40.020
We don't claim to be South Park gurus, so if we accidentally name something that South

26:40.020 --> 26:43.020
Park already made fun of, our bad.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.020
I have watched most of the episodes.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.020
This is like well over 100 that have been made, so I haven't seen them all, but I've

26:48.020 --> 26:49.020
seen a lot.

26:49.020 --> 26:50.020
I've probably seen about 100.

26:50.020 --> 26:54.020
All right, my number three pick would be, oh, this is too easy, because just imagine

26:54.020 --> 26:59.020
they could make fun of cosplaying if they did Final Fantasy.

26:59.020 --> 27:06.020
All right, so so far on our list, we have Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas,

27:06.020 --> 27:08.020
Karaoke Revolution, and Final Fantasy.

27:08.020 --> 27:11.020
DMN, what would be your number two pick?

27:11.020 --> 27:14.020
Custer's Revenge.

27:14.020 --> 27:16.020
Custer's Revenge.

27:16.020 --> 27:21.020
The old Atari 2600 classic, yes?

27:21.020 --> 27:22.020
Yes.

27:22.020 --> 27:27.020
Yes, where you can rape and pillage in very, very pixelated format.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.020
That would be interesting to see on South Park.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.020
I don't know.

27:30.020 --> 27:33.020
All right, well at least they both have crappy animation, so you know it would work out.

27:33.020 --> 27:35.020
Loki will be your number two pick.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.020
Oh, this is tough.

27:37.020 --> 27:44.020
I guess Twisted Metal, because that would be funny.

27:44.020 --> 27:46.020
Twisted Metal, interesting.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.020
All right.

27:47.020 --> 27:48.020
Just because it's interesting?

27:48.020 --> 27:51.020
Because it has lots of cars with guns on them.

27:51.020 --> 27:52.020
Oh, okay.

27:52.020 --> 27:54.020
Dark Soccer, your number two pick.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.020
Mario Kart.

27:55.020 --> 27:56.020
Mario Kart.

27:56.020 --> 28:02.020
Just imagine they throw, what was the ball-shaped kid's name?

28:02.020 --> 28:03.020
I don't remember.

28:03.020 --> 28:04.020
The Little Canadian.

28:04.020 --> 28:05.020
Oh, Ike?

28:05.020 --> 28:06.020
Ike.

28:06.020 --> 28:08.020
You know how they throw Ike as a thing, and then throw Kenny Ted?

28:08.020 --> 28:12.020
Didn't they have a South Park game that was kind of like Mario Kart?

28:12.020 --> 28:13.020
Yeah.

28:13.020 --> 28:16.020
But they never really referenced it on the show, so I guess it could work.

28:16.020 --> 28:17.020
All right, we'll see.

28:17.020 --> 28:18.020
All right.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.020
Let's see, my number two.

28:19.020 --> 28:25.020
My number two would be Silent Hill, because they not only have the games, but now the

28:25.020 --> 28:26.020
movie that they could spoof.

28:26.020 --> 28:30.020
And you know you want to see Pyramid Head in a little cheesy South Park form.

28:30.020 --> 28:31.020
And he could kill Kenny.

28:31.020 --> 28:32.020
I have to draw that now, you know.

28:32.020 --> 28:33.020
He could kill Kenny.

28:33.020 --> 28:34.020
He'll be great.

28:34.020 --> 28:36.020
All right, here we go.

28:36.020 --> 28:37.020
Number one picks.

28:37.020 --> 28:40.020
DMN, what would be your number one pick?

28:40.020 --> 28:45.020
Well, seeing as we're on the topic of crappy games, I thought I'd say, hey, why doesn't

28:45.020 --> 28:47.020
South Park make fun of South Park?

28:47.020 --> 28:51.020
So South Park, the game.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.020
Yes.

28:52.020 --> 28:53.020
Interesting.

28:53.020 --> 28:55.020
Interesting little play.

28:55.020 --> 28:59.020
Why doesn't South Park make fun of itself and its own crappy game that came out?

28:59.020 --> 29:00.020
Yeah.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.020
Good thought.

29:01.020 --> 29:02.020
Good thought.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.020
Which one?

29:03.020 --> 29:04.020
The Nintendo 64 one?

29:04.020 --> 29:05.020
Yes.

29:05.020 --> 29:06.020
Yeah, okay.

29:06.020 --> 29:07.020
Good.

29:07.020 --> 29:08.020
All right.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.020
Loki, your number one pick.

29:09.020 --> 29:10.020
That would be funny.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.020
I like that idea.

29:11.020 --> 29:12.020
Katamari Damacy.

29:12.020 --> 29:19.020
Did you see that commercial this week that was kind of inspired by Katamari Damacy?

29:19.020 --> 29:23.020
Yeah, except the people who made it say they were not inspired by the game in any way.

29:23.020 --> 29:25.020
I don't watch TV, so I have no idea what it is.

29:25.020 --> 29:26.020
It's on YouTube.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.020
Okay.

29:27.020 --> 29:28.020
That's the new TV.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.020
All right.

29:29.020 --> 29:30.020
Dark Sakura, what would be your number one?

29:30.020 --> 29:31.020
The Sims.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.020
The Sims.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.020
Oh, that's a good one.

29:33.020 --> 29:36.020
Imagine they do have somebody controlling them walking around town.

29:36.020 --> 29:37.020
Good one.

29:37.020 --> 29:38.020
Good one.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.020
All right.

29:39.020 --> 29:44.020
First, before I name my number one, let's go and look at some chat room picks.

29:44.020 --> 29:46.020
Here's some things the chat room are suggesting.

29:46.020 --> 29:49.020
O.L. Army Eddie says, Dead or Alive.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.020
GS68 says, Mortal Kombat.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.020
Let's see.

29:52.020 --> 29:54.020
Drew Nami says, Africa.

29:54.020 --> 29:57.020
Mechlar says, Loco Roco.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.020
GS68 says, Genji 2.

29:59.020 --> 30:02.020
Ravens Dolphin says, Dead Rising.

30:02.020 --> 30:04.020
Blazer says, Gradius.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.020
All very good guesses.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.020
Loco Roco would be funny with Cartman.

30:07.020 --> 30:08.020
That would be funny.

30:08.020 --> 30:10.020
How about Your Mom the Game last night?

30:10.020 --> 30:11.020
All right.

30:11.020 --> 30:12.020
Here it is in bed.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.020
Ooh.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.020
All right.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.020
Here it is.

30:15.020 --> 30:16.020
My number one pick is none of those.

30:16.020 --> 30:19.420
It's a game that desperately needs to be made fun of, especially after this week that I

30:19.420 --> 30:21.020
got my hands on it.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.020
Sonic the Hedgehog for 360.

30:24.020 --> 30:27.020
All right.

30:27.020 --> 30:34.980
So, here's the list as it stands so far, and we're going to have to take one of these off

30:34.980 --> 30:35.980
the list, DMN.

30:35.980 --> 30:38.980
You've got to take one of these off the list, and unfortunately the chat room will not be

30:38.980 --> 30:42.520
able to vote for it because you've ruined their hopes and dreams to be able to vote

30:42.520 --> 30:43.520
for it.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.520
Here it is.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.520
Here's the list as it stands so far.

30:45.520 --> 30:52.140
Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Karaoke Revolution, Final Fantasy, Custer's

30:52.140 --> 30:59.940
Revenge, Twisted Metal, Mario Kart, Silent Hill, South Park the Game, Katamari Damacy,

30:59.940 --> 31:03.220
The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.

31:03.220 --> 31:06.420
DMN, which one of these do you say South Park should not make fun of?

31:06.420 --> 31:08.300
Which should come off the list?

31:08.300 --> 31:12.460
Twisted Metal.

31:12.460 --> 31:13.460
Twisted Metal.

31:13.460 --> 31:16.020
Yeah, that was a little obscure, wasn't it?

31:16.020 --> 31:17.020
All right, Loki.

31:17.020 --> 31:18.020
This is too old.

31:18.020 --> 31:19.020
Yeah, it is a little obscure.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.020
Too old.

31:20.020 --> 31:23.020
All right, Loki, what's coming off the list?

31:23.020 --> 31:24.020
South Park the Game.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.940
It's a crappy game, but it just wouldn't be funny.

31:26.940 --> 31:28.780
You're not into the whole self-parody thing?

31:28.780 --> 31:30.940
I think it just wouldn't be that funny.

31:30.940 --> 31:31.940
All right.

31:31.940 --> 31:40.020
Dark Sakura, what's coming off the list?

31:40.020 --> 31:41.820
Night Trap would be too obscure.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.100
Night Trap is too obscure.

31:43.100 --> 31:49.580
As much as I agree, either Night Trap or Sewer Shark or something, nobody, unless they were

31:49.580 --> 31:54.540
in our age range of gamer, probably wouldn't get it.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.980
All right.

31:56.980 --> 32:00.740
Every pick that's left here is actually pretty good, so this is hard for me to take one off.

32:00.740 --> 32:02.940
I'm going to take off... Jamie, don't hate me.

32:02.940 --> 32:07.140
I'm taking off Karaoke Revolution, because since they already made fun of DDR, it's kind

32:07.140 --> 32:10.220
of close for me, so... All right.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.220
Rob.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.220
What?

32:12.220 --> 32:13.220
What?

32:13.220 --> 32:14.220
Rob.

32:14.220 --> 32:15.220
What?

32:15.220 --> 32:16.220
What?

32:16.220 --> 32:17.220
All right.

32:17.220 --> 32:18.220
Hi.

32:18.220 --> 32:19.220
I hate you.

32:19.220 --> 32:20.220
No, you don't.

32:20.220 --> 32:21.220
All right, here we go, Chat Room.

32:21.220 --> 32:23.420
You now have the chance to vote on your favorite.

32:23.420 --> 32:28.700
I need you to give a number one and a number two, and here is what you get to vote on.

32:28.700 --> 32:31.540
All right, and DMN, you don't get to vote, because you already helped.

32:31.540 --> 32:32.540
Okay.

32:32.540 --> 32:33.540
All right, here it is.

32:33.540 --> 32:34.940
Here's the list, and I posted it there in Chat.

32:34.940 --> 32:40.780
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Final Fantasy, Custer's Revenge, Mario Kart, Silent Hill,

32:40.780 --> 32:45.400
Katamari Damacy, The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.540
Place votes now.

32:46.540 --> 32:48.380
Your number one and number two picks.

32:48.380 --> 32:51.660
Send a private message to Sky in the Chat Room with your vote.

32:51.660 --> 32:54.340
Remember, it doesn't count unless it's over private message.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.300
We'll tally up the votes and reveal it shortly here in the show.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.400
DMN, thanks for your help.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
No problem.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.400
You guys have a good night.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.460
Hey, anything else you wanted to get out, since we probably won't get back to you during

33:03.460 --> 33:04.460
call-ins?

33:04.460 --> 33:07.420
Anything else you wanted to get out of your system while we have you on the line?

33:07.420 --> 33:09.740
No, I can save it for another show, I think.

33:09.740 --> 33:10.740
All right.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.740
Fair enough.

33:11.740 --> 33:12.740
All right.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.020
Well, DMN, thanks for being here, and you're going to be here in person in about a month,

33:15.020 --> 33:16.020
right?

33:16.020 --> 33:17.020
Yeah.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.020
That should be interesting.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.020
All right.

33:19.020 --> 33:20.020
I'll get to it.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.020
See you later.

33:21.020 --> 33:22.020
All right.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.020
Bye.

33:23.020 --> 33:24.020
Bye.

33:24.020 --> 33:25.020
Bye.

33:25.020 --> 33:26.020
All right.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.020
Well, some interesting stuff.

33:27.020 --> 33:32.020
It's been pretty dark, but the whole controversy with Bully, apparently, people were wrong.

33:32.020 --> 33:41.900
It says Bully has been shown to, E3 was shown to a very few press people, but now that it's

33:41.900 --> 33:47.380
almost out, actually, in the next couple of weeks, it's been shown to a lot more people.

33:47.380 --> 33:54.300
Actually, the game itself, which garnered a teen rating, isn't as controversial as it

33:54.300 --> 33:58.060
seems and, actually, pretty fun.

33:58.060 --> 34:03.100
Unfortunately, since all these outrageous claims are made by people that, well, haven't

34:03.100 --> 34:08.380
played the game, it's kind of a whole situation where a lot of people have egg on their face

34:08.380 --> 34:09.380
now.

34:09.380 --> 34:16.180
So, take that, JT.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.180
All right.

34:17.180 --> 34:21.620
Speaking of politically oriented things, we love those guys over at Game Politics.

34:21.620 --> 34:26.860
We just wanted to give a mention that gamepolitics.com has launched this week and, unfortunately,

34:26.860 --> 34:30.180
it means they have come off of LiveJournal for their commenting system, but they have

34:30.180 --> 34:35.460
a fancy-schmancy new website made in WordPress, so you should check it out, gamepolitics.com.

34:35.460 --> 34:39.760
We just wanted to give them a shout out and Dark Soccer is going to give another website

34:39.760 --> 34:42.900
or a shout out right now because she surfs the web up and down every week.

34:42.900 --> 34:43.900
At work.

34:43.900 --> 34:47.900
At work, so she can find a pick worthy to share with the rest of you all and it's her

34:47.900 --> 34:48.900
website of the week.

34:48.900 --> 34:49.900
Here it is.

34:49.900 --> 34:56.420
You know, we should really be using the Mr. Rogers music for this part.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.420
Maybe next week.

34:57.420 --> 34:58.420
Okay.

34:58.420 --> 35:02.740
At any rate, my site of the week is actually one that another of our listeners linked to

35:02.740 --> 35:07.780
me when I did the Dr. Who site last week, but it's actually a very good Dr. Who fan

35:07.780 --> 35:08.780
site.

35:08.780 --> 35:11.300
It's Dr. Who online.

35:11.300 --> 35:21.540
The website address is drwho-online.co.uk and Dr. is drwho-online.co.uk.

35:21.540 --> 35:24.020
Oh my God, this site is fantastic.

35:24.020 --> 35:31.940
They actually have the Dr. Who Online Whocast, which I'm going to be giving a try within

35:31.940 --> 35:32.940
the week.

35:32.940 --> 35:35.780
Lots of this really good stuff.

35:35.780 --> 35:42.300
They have a little area called psychic paper references, just a lot of stuff.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.700
Even an eBay link to a shop.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.900
It's a really fantastic site.

35:46.900 --> 35:57.460
I suggest going to it if there's a place to comment or if someone sent you an email.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.460
Excellent.

35:58.460 --> 36:02.900
Well, got some cool stuff here, especially from the folks that make Gears of War epic.

36:02.900 --> 36:11.100
Your thought on the whole Xbox 360 is you don't need to have an HDTV to be able to enjoy

36:11.100 --> 36:13.220
their games.

36:13.220 --> 36:20.380
They are making sure by testing their game, Gears of War, on a bunch of small SDTVs, making

36:20.380 --> 36:25.620
sure that you can read the text in the game, unlike say Capcom who couldn't give a flying

36:25.620 --> 36:32.360
fuck that you don't have a HDTV, so at least someone's getting it right.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.860
It's awfully good.

36:33.860 --> 36:34.860
Very reassuring.

36:34.860 --> 36:41.500
Well, in other reassuring news, actually, for anyone who's thinking that, oh, Wii's

36:41.500 --> 36:44.860
coming out, I don't have to keep my GameCube stuff, no.

36:44.860 --> 36:52.860
The Wavebirds are apparently going to be able to be used on the Wii and certain Wii games.

36:52.860 --> 36:56.620
You will still need your receiver plug-in.

36:56.620 --> 37:00.260
There's a slot on top of the console that you can plug that into.

37:00.260 --> 37:04.700
But there's not really any word out as far as how well it's going to work with Virtual

37:04.700 --> 37:13.380
Console, but it's apparently going to work with the Wii anyway, so yay.

37:13.380 --> 37:14.380
All right.

37:14.380 --> 37:17.820
Well, I'm still trying to tally up the Listless votes, so maybe we ought to just go on to

37:17.820 --> 37:18.820
our next story.

37:18.820 --> 37:19.820
We got flooded with...

37:19.820 --> 37:20.820
That's me again.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.780
We have over 50 votes tonight for Listless.

37:22.780 --> 37:23.780
I'm trying to crazy tally them up.

37:23.780 --> 37:24.780
I'm sorry, Bobby.

37:24.780 --> 37:25.780
Nice try.

37:25.780 --> 37:26.780
Nice try.

37:26.780 --> 37:33.900
Well, you know, for anybody who is a bit of a snake charmer, you can play with your snake

37:33.900 --> 37:37.780
in public, no less, and not get arrested for it.

37:37.780 --> 37:43.620
There are already Metal Gear Solid 4 figures that will go out with the release of the game

37:43.620 --> 37:44.620
on the PS3.

37:44.620 --> 37:47.900
A 12-inch tall made by MediComp.

37:47.900 --> 37:51.800
MediComp puts out some really nice figures, by the way.

37:51.800 --> 37:57.860
There's a prototype model up on gaygamer.net that looks pretty cool.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.940
Snake's just really old, though.

37:59.940 --> 38:01.500
I'm sorry.

38:01.500 --> 38:12.900
But the figure, though, is they're stating that it may be something about 95,000 yen,

38:12.900 --> 38:19.700
up to maybe 20,000, so I don't know.

38:19.700 --> 38:26.540
I do think the comment on the forum here is, Snake's got a great ass for an old guy.

38:26.540 --> 38:27.540
That's true.

38:27.540 --> 38:31.500
Snake does have a good ass for an old guy.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.940
So Rod, how's the tallying going?

38:32.940 --> 38:34.820
I'm almost done.

38:34.820 --> 38:36.900
I was not anticipating this many votes.

38:36.900 --> 38:37.900
This is crazy.

38:37.900 --> 38:41.520
You guys are making this live experience an awesome one, although a lot of work.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.520
You know what?

38:42.520 --> 38:45.020
If Drew comes back next week, he's going to be the vote tallyer in the future.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.020
Well, I'll tell you what.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.020
In the meantime...

38:47.020 --> 38:48.020
Do you have some last-minute stories?

38:48.020 --> 38:49.020
Yes.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.020
Let's get right to the end of the show.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.020
I will kill time for you.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.020
First off...

38:52.020 --> 38:56.460
We will be opening up the Skype line very soon, ladies and gentlemen, 916-226-9067.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.960
Keep in mind that is a toll call.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.520
By the way, toll-free number coming by the end of the month.

39:01.520 --> 39:02.520
So that's awesome.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.860
It's going to be awesome.

39:03.860 --> 39:05.280
Also, you can always call us.

39:05.280 --> 39:11.480
The other free way would be to go on to orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us, and get the information

39:11.480 --> 39:14.280
on Skype, username orangeloungeradio.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.280
Go for it, Loki.

39:15.280 --> 39:20.640
Anyways, as we like to do every week, we're reporting some stuff that you might not know

39:20.640 --> 39:23.480
yet, because it hasn't been reported on the front of a magazine.

39:23.480 --> 39:28.520
Well, the first, of course, actually the only one I have this week is Call of Duty 2 on

39:28.520 --> 39:32.120
the Xbox 360, dropped down to $39.99.

39:32.120 --> 39:37.100
So if you don't own it yet, might be a time to find a used one, now they should be even

39:37.100 --> 39:43.820
cheaper than that, although, I mean, Call of Duty 3 is coming out in November, so whatever.

39:43.820 --> 39:48.120
It's a good game, though, definitely worth the multiplayer, so check it out.

39:48.120 --> 39:53.480
Some other fun news, Nintendo, there was a whole controversy about the Wii using the

39:53.480 --> 39:54.480
friend codes.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.860
Well, they're going to make it a little bit easier on you.

39:56.860 --> 40:01.560
They will be using the friend's code system, however, they are going to only require that

40:01.560 --> 40:03.840
you have one friend code.

40:03.840 --> 40:08.200
So you'll be able to share that friend code and then be friended for all the other games.

40:08.200 --> 40:12.520
So that is good, you know, at least a good way to do that.

40:12.520 --> 40:16.020
I swear I had that in the show role, that's crazy, my bad.

40:16.020 --> 40:19.180
And then there's some other stuff.

40:19.180 --> 40:24.960
There was actually legislation that's in the house right now to require the ESRB to actually

40:24.960 --> 40:28.980
play through the entire game before reviewing them.

40:28.980 --> 40:33.320
So that's kind of interesting, I don't think it's going to work because, you know, that

40:33.320 --> 40:34.320
would take forever.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.720
It would seriously delay the release of all the games.

40:35.720 --> 40:39.640
It would delay games and how would you do, like, MMOs or games that have new content

40:39.640 --> 40:41.640
added to them constantly.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.760
I don't think it's going to work.

40:42.760 --> 40:43.760
It's unrealistic.

40:43.760 --> 40:47.680
And why are they having, why is the government concerning themselves with this kind of stuff

40:47.680 --> 40:49.680
anyways?

40:49.680 --> 40:54.680
What I think should be is that I think that on the websites there should be a parent link

40:54.680 --> 41:02.120
for any internet savvy parent to go online, get content warnings of the games more in

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
depth.

41:03.120 --> 41:09.000
I think the manufacturer does have a degree of responsibility to make sure that they give

41:09.000 --> 41:13.680
accurate listings, but if they're really so concerned about it, then they can make it

41:13.680 --> 41:17.520
a requirement for the manufacturers to have more information made available.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.960
Or you know how, like, when you buy food it says for nutritional content, write in to

41:20.960 --> 41:23.520
this address or go on this website?

41:23.520 --> 41:25.680
I think it should be the same thing.

41:25.680 --> 41:31.200
However, I think that it really is up to the parent to do the research before allowing

41:31.200 --> 41:32.800
their child to buy the game.

41:32.800 --> 41:38.240
As far as children, though, buying the games without their parent's permission, oh well.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.520
Some other fun stuff.

41:40.520 --> 41:46.800
Rockstar announced a brand new series this week actually called L.A. Noire and more information

41:46.800 --> 41:52.240
should be coming out when the official trailer is released on October 5th, and if you want

41:52.240 --> 41:59.400
more information on that, you can visit rockstargames.com slash L.A. Noire, that's L-A-N-O-I-R-E.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.880
And looks like it's going to be a game that, of course, you know, kind of pays tribute

42:02.880 --> 42:10.120
to a lot of the film noir movies, much like, you know, say L.A. Confidential or even if

42:10.120 --> 42:13.520
you want to go really old, The Maltese Falcon.

42:13.520 --> 42:18.100
So that should be pretty cool, kind of Grand Theft Auto-ish.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.660
So I'm looking forward to that.

42:19.660 --> 42:22.760
And then finally, some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.

42:22.760 --> 42:27.200
As we mentioned before, Sierra's planning on releasing some games to Xbox Live Arcade.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.200
The first...

42:28.200 --> 42:29.200
King's Quest?

42:29.200 --> 42:30.200
King's Quest?

42:30.200 --> 42:31.200
King's Quest?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.200
King's Quest?

42:32.200 --> 42:34.200
There's a couple of games that were announced.

42:34.200 --> 42:40.160
Assault Heroes, which is going to be another over-the-head kind of shooter game that, you

42:40.160 --> 42:45.880
know, using two analog sticks, think, you know, Geometry Wars, but still pretty cool.

42:45.880 --> 42:51.080
Then my favorite game, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, and that

42:51.080 --> 42:52.560
was a really fun mini golf game.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.320
I used to piss off people with that.

42:54.320 --> 42:59.360
And then, of course, Codemasters also announced the X06 Sensible Soccer, which I think was

42:59.360 --> 43:02.480
announced even before that.

43:02.480 --> 43:07.240
And of course, a very classic game should be MacKenzie Way.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.600
I wanted to go to the chat room for some comments here.

43:09.600 --> 43:14.480
DNL, who by the way, posted some great artwork to our Live Journal community this week.

43:14.480 --> 43:17.440
Check it out if you're a user of Live Journal or Community Orange Lounge on there.

43:17.440 --> 43:23.320
DNL says, in regards to the ESRB thing, on the back of the package, it does say ESRB

43:23.320 --> 43:26.080
content rating, www.esrb.org.

43:26.080 --> 43:29.480
And also something I wanted to add on that whole ESRB thing is that when you play a game

43:29.480 --> 43:33.900
online, you always do get that, you know, warning that comes up, warning, game experience

43:33.900 --> 43:38.880
may change with online play, doo-doo-doo type thing, so something to think about.

43:38.880 --> 43:42.840
All right, I finally have some results for you guys.

43:42.840 --> 43:43.840
You ready?

43:43.840 --> 43:46.520
My God, that was a lot of work.

43:46.520 --> 43:51.340
All right, here it is, the definitive list, games we would like to see South Park make

43:51.340 --> 43:52.340
fun of next.

43:52.340 --> 43:56.960
And I got to tell you, this list turned out really freaking weird, considering we had

43:56.960 --> 43:59.700
so many votes, there were a lot of ties.

43:59.700 --> 44:07.120
So here it is, the number one game you want to see South Park make fun of was a tie.

44:07.120 --> 44:14.360
Game number one, Silent Hill, and game number two, Katamari Damacy, those games tied for

44:14.360 --> 44:15.360
first place.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.360
Damacy.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.360
Whatever.

44:17.360 --> 44:23.680
And now what's interesting is so that takes us to third place, and there was also a tie.

44:23.680 --> 44:27.240
So we have two games tied for third place, because you know, you have first and second

44:27.240 --> 44:28.440
place basically tied there.

44:28.440 --> 44:34.800
So for third place, we have Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and Final Fantasy are the two

44:34.800 --> 44:37.560
games that came in third place there.

44:37.560 --> 44:38.920
So that is the definitive list.

44:38.920 --> 44:43.480
Thank you guys all for voting and giving me a lot of work there during that segment.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.480
Yikes.

44:44.480 --> 44:48.360
Well, we'll see if any of those actually make it to the show.

44:48.360 --> 44:50.640
And then you can say you heard it here first.

44:50.640 --> 44:54.320
Let's go to the Skype line, boys and girls, and take some calls.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

44:56.640 --> 44:57.640
Who's this?

44:57.640 --> 44:58.640
Raven's Dolphin.

44:58.640 --> 44:59.640
Hi, my friend.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.280
What's on your mind?

45:01.280 --> 45:04.320
I just want to say one news, Ryan.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.320
Yeah?

45:05.320 --> 45:08.920
It's Gamefly.

45:08.920 --> 45:12.080
They actually did some more things with Gamefly.

45:12.080 --> 45:15.120
They now have four tiers now.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.120
Four tiers?

45:16.120 --> 45:17.120
Yeah.

45:17.120 --> 45:23.140
Now you can get one game for $15.99, you can get two games for $21, you can get now, they

45:23.140 --> 45:29.560
just added this, three games for $30, or you can go for the Kitten Kaboodle, which you'll

45:29.560 --> 45:34.000
lock yourself in your room forever, four games for $40.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.480
Netflix does like eight.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.720
You can do like up to eight movies on Netflix.

45:38.720 --> 45:43.100
So at least I think you can, so I'm not too surprised.

45:43.100 --> 45:46.160
They probably would let you do more if you really want, but damn, what do you need with

45:46.160 --> 45:47.160
five games at a time?

45:47.160 --> 45:49.440
What do you need with four games at a time?

45:49.440 --> 45:53.960
Two is enough so that you have, well, one's really enough, but two is enough so that when

45:53.960 --> 45:56.740
one's in the mail, you still have something to play.

45:56.740 --> 45:57.740
That's right.

45:57.740 --> 46:01.640
So they don't need more than that in my opinion, but whatever.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.280
It's your money, spend it how you want.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.360
Yeah, because I'm poor, I have to save up for a week.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.560
Are you a Gamefly subscriber?

46:07.560 --> 46:08.560
Yes, I am.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
I don't use them.

46:09.560 --> 46:10.560
What do you think of them?

46:10.560 --> 46:13.120
I mean, it's not because I dislike them or anything, I just at this time choose not to

46:13.120 --> 46:14.120
use them.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.120
What do you think of them?

46:15.120 --> 46:17.840
Actually, they got really better.

46:17.840 --> 46:23.160
Before at first, they didn't ship my games for like nine days, and now it's coming in

46:23.160 --> 46:24.720
four.

46:24.720 --> 46:28.160
Black Wolf in our chat room is commenting, you just had to be a member for a month before

46:28.160 --> 46:29.780
you got the third game option.

46:29.780 --> 46:31.600
They had three games from Gamefly years ago.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.440
The four games is new.

46:33.440 --> 46:37.240
Well, they just gave it to me for 25 cents this month, Black Wolf.

46:37.240 --> 46:38.240
I'm sorry.

46:38.240 --> 46:40.200
I guess they're not nice to me.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.200
All right.

46:41.200 --> 46:44.320
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

46:44.320 --> 46:47.760
Yeah, one other thing.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.760
What is it?

46:50.760 --> 46:51.760
What was it?

46:51.760 --> 46:52.760
Oh, I know.

46:52.760 --> 46:53.760
I know.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.960
I just bought an iPod, so I'm now mad at Apple.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.120
Why?

46:57.120 --> 47:02.000
Because they just came out with the new Nanos, and it looks like a little mini iPod.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Remember the ones with the black and white screen thing, the iPod mini?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Yeah.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.960
Well, I got an old Nano, so I'm now mad at them.

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
You might.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.220
Well, I doubt you could do it, because sometimes if they do a price cut, like a week after

47:13.220 --> 47:19.680
you bought it, they'll give you a refund, but maybe not with the old models versus new

47:19.680 --> 47:20.680
models.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.680
You never know.

47:21.680 --> 47:22.680
Check their website.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.680
I don't know.

47:23.680 --> 47:24.680
Couldn't tell you.

47:24.680 --> 47:25.680
Yeah.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.680
Yeah.

47:26.680 --> 47:27.680
That's about it.

47:27.680 --> 47:28.680
All right, Ravenstaufen.

47:28.680 --> 47:29.680
Well, thanks so much for your call.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.920
We'll talk to you again soon, all right?

47:31.920 --> 47:32.920
You bet.

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
All right.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
Later.

47:34.920 --> 47:35.920
All right.

47:35.920 --> 47:36.920
Let's go to another call.

47:36.920 --> 47:37.920
We're getting a lot of calls tonight.

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
Hopefully, we get to everybody.

47:38.920 --> 47:39.920
Hi.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:40.920 --> 47:41.920
Who's this?

47:41.920 --> 47:42.920
Hi.

47:42.920 --> 47:43.920
Can you guys hear me?

47:43.920 --> 47:44.920
Yes, we can hear you.

47:44.920 --> 47:45.920
Who's this?

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
Oh, hi.

47:46.920 --> 47:47.920
This is Blue Monster from the chat room.

47:47.920 --> 47:48.920
Hi.

47:48.920 --> 47:49.920
What's on your mind?

47:49.920 --> 47:50.920
Hello.

47:50.920 --> 47:51.920
Hi.

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
I just wanted to share two things.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.880
The first one is congrats on the show, man, because seriously, it's something I look forward

47:55.880 --> 47:56.880
to every week.

47:56.880 --> 47:57.880
Thank you.

47:57.880 --> 47:58.880
I really appreciate that.

47:58.880 --> 48:02.520
A constant in your life, as I was telling you earlier to Dark Sakura.

48:02.520 --> 48:07.280
Anyways, the second little thing I want to share with you guys is I've picked up Okami

48:07.280 --> 48:08.280
last week.

48:08.280 --> 48:12.240
Yes, that's a game I've heard a lot of great things about and seen a lot of good things

48:12.240 --> 48:13.240
about.

48:13.240 --> 48:16.600
I'm a little tight on my gaming budget right now, so I haven't been able to pick it up,

48:16.600 --> 48:17.600
but yeah, I'm really curious.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.480
What do you think of this game?

48:19.480 --> 48:20.480
That's what I actually wanted to call.

48:20.480 --> 48:24.600
I wanted to give you a mini review kind of thing.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
It's a pretty good game.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.600
It's a pretty good game.

48:26.600 --> 48:32.060
It's very solid-ish, but the only thing I have against it is there's a lot of hand-holding.

48:32.060 --> 48:35.040
The first dozen hours, I put over 24 in it.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.040
The first 12 hours, it's like nothing but hand-holding.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.880
They tell you everything, the way you've got to stop it.

48:39.880 --> 48:45.440
So if you're looking for some hardcore, solid-ish style of gameplay, you'll have a hard time

48:45.440 --> 48:49.320
getting through it, at least for the first half.

48:49.320 --> 48:54.640
Enchanted Arms, which is a game I have been playing lately, is very similar because every

48:54.640 --> 48:58.480
time you go into a new dungeon, it seems like there's some new environmental thing, like

48:58.480 --> 49:00.840
press A to get into the cart.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.920
Press A to move the teleporter, and they'll have to have this whole back and forth where

49:03.920 --> 49:05.640
the main character is like, how do I do this?

49:05.640 --> 49:08.640
And one of the other smarter people in the party says, well, you walk up to it and press

49:08.640 --> 49:11.440
A. But that's the answer every single time.

49:11.440 --> 49:14.760
You walk up to it and press A. They could have just said it in the beginning.

49:14.760 --> 49:16.760
They could have just said it in the beginning.

49:16.760 --> 49:21.000
They have a little tune that's jumping up and down the nose of the wolf, and he tells

49:21.000 --> 49:25.340
you all the time, oh, maybe I should use my brush to cut this vine, which I've been doing

49:25.340 --> 49:29.240
for the past six hours, please don't do it myself.

49:29.240 --> 49:32.900
Maybe you should just have had a thing that says, hey, whenever you see new shit, press

49:32.900 --> 49:33.900
A.

49:33.900 --> 49:34.900
Yeah.

49:34.900 --> 49:38.400
But overall, it's really good music, really good art style.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.680
The graphics are really good.

49:39.680 --> 49:44.160
There is a bit of slowdown because there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen sometimes.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.960
But overall, it's a really good game.

49:45.960 --> 49:50.320
It seems long because I've already put 24 hours in it, and the game actually just got

49:50.320 --> 49:51.320
started.

49:51.320 --> 49:56.240
And the hand-holding just now stopped, so I'm guessing it's going to be a long game.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.760
So it's a good game to get if you're waiting for Pilot Princess, I guess.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
Awesome.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.760
Now, one other question I have for you.

50:01.760 --> 50:05.240
For those that don't know much about Okami, maybe we've seen the graphics that has that

50:05.240 --> 50:08.920
very unique hand-drawn style to it.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.440
What would you compare this game to?

50:10.440 --> 50:14.180
If you could compare it to any other game, maybe half this and half this, what would

50:14.180 --> 50:16.960
you say it's kind of like for people that want to know if they'd be interested in this

50:16.960 --> 50:17.960
or not?

50:17.960 --> 50:23.860
It makes the world of Wind Waker and the style, cartoony style of Wind Waker, but also add

50:23.860 --> 50:28.440
a bit of a stench of Chester Radio or Chester Radio Future, and maybe some beautiful Joe

50:28.440 --> 50:29.440
in it.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.440
Interesting.

50:30.440 --> 50:31.440
Interesting.

50:31.440 --> 50:35.000
And all those games kind of have that same art style, too, so that's kind of interesting.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.760
The thing is that Wind Waker is very clean-looking, this is more dirty.

50:40.760 --> 50:44.760
The graphics are not that clean because of the brush thing and the whole brush theme

50:44.760 --> 50:45.760
that it has.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.760
So it's more beautiful Joe-ish.

50:47.760 --> 50:48.760
It's still really good.

50:48.760 --> 50:52.360
It's very Japanese, so you've got to be open-minded about it.

50:52.360 --> 50:55.680
It's still a really good game, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes

50:55.680 --> 50:56.880
that kind of game.

50:56.880 --> 51:01.680
And don't be scared, it's not as platformer as it seems to be.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.040
It's more adventure-ish and more pilot-ish, I guess.

51:04.040 --> 51:05.040
All right.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.040
Very cool.

51:06.040 --> 51:07.040
Now, hey, I have one more question for you.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.440
You're calling us from Argentina, right?

51:08.440 --> 51:09.440
I'm calling from Argentina.

51:09.440 --> 51:11.120
It's 1 a.m. in the morning over here.

51:11.120 --> 51:12.120
Awesome.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.120
Oh, my gosh.

51:13.120 --> 51:14.120
Wow, you're hardcore.

51:14.120 --> 51:16.100
I do have one quick question for you, though.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.040
How much do you pay for games in your country?

51:18.040 --> 51:21.320
Because we know that, you know, we hear a lot about the UK and how they're having to

51:21.320 --> 51:25.000
pay higher prices, and across the board, a lot of other countries have to pay higher

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
prices.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
What's it like in Argentina?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.120
Well, here's the thing.

51:29.120 --> 51:33.440
You pay about 80 U.S. dollars for a game in between 70 or 80, if you want the original

51:33.440 --> 51:36.920
copy, of course, because there's a black market here, like, you wouldn't believe, like, you

51:36.920 --> 51:39.600
can buy a game for two bucks if you want to, U.S.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.600
Wow.

51:40.600 --> 51:46.200
But, yeah, but if you actually want an original game, you've got a pony of about 70 pay bucks,

51:46.200 --> 51:49.520
and it's all games because you don't get the new stuff right away, and you've got to take

51:49.520 --> 51:56.200
into account that a maid here, like a maid full-time maid here, maybe cost 200 U.S. dollars

51:56.200 --> 51:57.200
a month.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.200
Wow.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.200
Wow.

51:59.200 --> 52:04.080
So, you know, I know, so it's like, basically, a game is about half the salary of a maid

52:04.080 --> 52:05.080
for a month.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.080
Gosh.

52:06.080 --> 52:09.080
Well, hey, now, your copy of Okami is legit, though, right?

52:09.080 --> 52:10.080
Not really.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.080
Uh-oh.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.080
Uh-oh.

52:12.080 --> 52:15.080
Well, we better hurry and end this call.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.900
We won't tell on you.

52:16.900 --> 52:17.900
We won't.

52:17.900 --> 52:18.900
We won't.

52:18.900 --> 52:19.900
We won't.

52:19.900 --> 52:20.900
We won't give out your full name or anything.

52:20.900 --> 52:21.900
I'm glad you got to call in, though.

52:21.900 --> 52:22.900
Yeah.

52:22.900 --> 52:23.900
Yeah.

52:23.900 --> 52:24.900
I'm glad I called on you.

52:24.900 --> 52:25.900
All right.

52:25.900 --> 52:26.900
It was fun.

52:26.900 --> 52:27.900
It was really good.

52:27.900 --> 52:30.040
Well, have fun with the game, and we know that when you can't afford it, you will buy

52:30.040 --> 52:31.600
the legit copy.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.680
I already pre-opted this, so, you know.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.680
Oh, good.

52:34.680 --> 52:35.680
Good.

52:35.680 --> 52:36.680
Okay.

52:36.680 --> 52:37.680
All right.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
Happy ending.

52:38.680 --> 52:39.680
All right.

52:39.680 --> 52:40.680
Take care, buddy.

52:40.680 --> 52:41.680
Thanks for calling.

52:41.680 --> 52:42.680
See you.

52:42.680 --> 52:43.680
Bye.

52:43.680 --> 52:44.680
That's great.

52:44.680 --> 52:45.680
We love hearing from people.

52:45.680 --> 52:49.560
We love hearing from employees, but over-plan it because, you know, you're all the way down

52:49.560 --> 52:50.560
there right now.

52:50.560 --> 52:51.560
I just got to keep looking south.

52:51.560 --> 52:52.560
Oh, my God.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.920
SSJ-100, Matt's going happy ending.

52:53.920 --> 52:58.800
The thing is, is that I'm in massage therapy school, so I know what you mean, so just don't

52:58.800 --> 52:59.800
put it.

52:59.800 --> 53:00.800
Oh, God.

53:00.800 --> 53:01.800
You guys, go play Uno.

53:01.800 --> 53:03.080
They cover that in massage therapy school?

53:03.080 --> 53:04.080
No, they don't.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.400
I haven't started school yet, though.

53:05.400 --> 53:07.080
Go play Uno, you sick fucks.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.080
All right.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.080
Hi, here on Orange Launch Radio.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.080
Who's this?

53:10.080 --> 53:11.080
Hi.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.080
This is Eddie.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.080
Hi, Eddie.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.080
What's on your mind, buddy?

53:14.080 --> 53:15.080
Yeah.

53:15.080 --> 53:19.400
I just heard you heard about that thing, like a guy posted on the All Games forums that

53:19.400 --> 53:25.240
like he was booted out of Uno because somebody saw that he was a black guy.

53:25.240 --> 53:27.380
I did read that post, isn't it?

53:27.380 --> 53:28.480
That is so fucked up.

53:28.480 --> 53:29.800
I did read that post.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.080
Yeah, somebody, oh, oh, that sucks.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.680
I don't think I know about this.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
You know what?

53:34.680 --> 53:35.680
Oh, no.

53:35.680 --> 53:39.600
God, can we find the post real quick?

53:39.600 --> 53:42.160
This just made me so angry.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.440
Some people are so stupid.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.440
I swear to God.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.440
Let's see if I can find it.

53:46.440 --> 53:49.040
Do you remember what forum it was in?

53:49.040 --> 53:53.000
It was the... Let me ask you real quick, while I hunt for

53:53.000 --> 53:57.920
the post, is there any other topics you want to bring up tonight?

53:57.920 --> 54:00.440
I had something related to that thing.

54:00.440 --> 54:09.040
One of the replies to the article was that that's why the me on the we thing is so good

54:09.040 --> 54:12.200
because you can create your own avatar or whatever.

54:12.200 --> 54:18.240
I was just thinking that it doesn't really solve the racism issue since if the only way

54:18.240 --> 54:24.440
to play a game is to create an avatar that is not black, then it's not really a representation

54:24.440 --> 54:27.720
of yourself if you are black, right?

54:27.720 --> 54:28.720
Yeah.

54:28.720 --> 54:32.520
But, it shouldn't matter.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.520
It shouldn't matter at all.

54:33.520 --> 54:38.040
I mean, in World of Warcraft, we play purple and green people and it doesn't matter, you

54:38.040 --> 54:39.040
know?

54:39.040 --> 54:40.040
Yeah, yeah.

54:40.040 --> 54:44.080
And then, you know, when they demoed the we, they showed them making Samuel L. Jackson

54:44.080 --> 54:46.960
the baddest motherfucker on the planet, you know?

54:46.960 --> 54:51.540
I would cower in fear if I was playing against Samuel L. Jackson, you know, because he's

54:51.540 --> 54:52.540
a badass.

54:52.540 --> 54:55.160
But, man, this is... Wow, people are just so superficial.

54:55.160 --> 54:57.120
Anyway, I found the post.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.120
Here it is.

54:58.120 --> 55:01.200
I realized probably like 50 of you linked it in chat room, but I did find it on my own.

55:01.200 --> 55:02.200
Thank you very much.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.200
Here it is.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.200
This was made by a post.

55:04.200 --> 55:09.080
The guy is named Five Fingers of Death and this is on allgames.com's forums in the Xbox

55:09.080 --> 55:10.080
360 section.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.800
Does vision cam hamper jump in vision of live?

55:12.800 --> 55:14.880
I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this.

55:14.880 --> 55:18.640
I purchased my vision cam last week and hooked it up to experience a couple of multiplayer

55:18.640 --> 55:19.720
UNO sessions.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.760
When I connected, all three people I was paired with also had the camera.

55:22.760 --> 55:28.580
I heard someone mention, he's a black guy, and then I was booted by the host.

55:28.580 --> 55:31.560
As we know, live has always had its racist comments, but for the most part, you could

55:31.560 --> 55:33.520
never really tell who you were gaming with.

55:33.520 --> 55:36.380
For all we know, David Duke could be playing with Louis Farrakhan and neither would be

55:36.380 --> 55:37.380
the wiser.

55:37.380 --> 55:40.880
Now, being able to actually see the person, how will this affect the live community?

55:40.880 --> 55:41.880
Just wondering.

55:41.880 --> 55:46.000
Oh, I can't wait for me to get on the camera and have somebody go, that guy looks like

55:46.000 --> 55:48.620
a fag, boot him.

55:48.620 --> 55:50.640
You wouldn't want to play with those fuckers anyway.

55:50.640 --> 55:57.280
I mean, it's fucked up, it's stupid, put all those people on your ban list and warn them

55:57.280 --> 55:59.800
and damage them the best you can.

55:59.800 --> 56:02.280
So stupid.

56:02.280 --> 56:05.840
They obviously don't want to play a good game, good old fashioned game of UNO anyway.

56:05.840 --> 56:12.300
I mean, it doesn't make it right at all, by any means does it make it right, but I guess

56:12.300 --> 56:17.760
until Microsoft steps in, I don't even know what Microsoft can do.

56:17.760 --> 56:20.360
What can they do?

56:20.360 --> 56:26.800
So it's up to the community, the police itself, I suppose, I don't know, disturbing.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.720
Anything else you want to say on that?

56:29.720 --> 56:34.640
Well not on that issue, but take pictures of Cookie Box.

56:34.640 --> 56:35.640
I will.

56:35.640 --> 56:36.640
I will.

56:36.640 --> 56:39.640
So you can get them from Granville Island, one of my favorite places in Vancouver.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.640
I appreciate it.

56:40.640 --> 56:41.640
Yep.

56:41.640 --> 56:42.640
All right, have a good one, buddy.

56:42.640 --> 56:43.640
All right, you too.

56:43.640 --> 56:44.640
Later.

56:44.640 --> 56:45.640
Bye.

56:45.640 --> 56:46.640
Bye.

56:46.640 --> 56:47.640
Let's go to one more call.

56:47.640 --> 56:48.640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

56:48.640 --> 56:49.640
Who's this?

56:49.640 --> 56:50.640
It's Ron.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.640
Hi, guys.

56:51.640 --> 56:52.640
Hi, Jamie.

56:52.640 --> 56:53.640
Hello.

56:53.640 --> 56:54.640
You always get through every week, Rama.

56:54.640 --> 56:55.640
How do you manage it?

56:55.640 --> 56:56.640
I did it through last week.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.640
Well, you were here last week, right?

56:57.640 --> 56:59.640
I made it in the last segment of the show.

56:59.640 --> 57:00.640
That's right, that's right.

57:00.640 --> 57:01.960
Oh, what's up, my friend?

57:01.960 --> 57:02.960
Not much.

57:02.960 --> 57:03.960
There's a couple of things I want to tell you about.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.680
Here's a little known fact.

57:05.680 --> 57:09.680
Mr. Rogers was a sniper in the Marine Corps.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.000
Isn't that an urban legend?

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
No.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.040
When I was training with the Marines, they were showing us the tapes of famous Marines

57:16.040 --> 57:17.040
on the tape.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.040
What's it?

57:18.040 --> 57:19.040
Wow.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.040
Okay.

57:20.040 --> 57:23.400
Well, you know, I'm not going to say you're a liar.

57:23.400 --> 57:24.800
I just always thought that was an urban legend.

57:24.800 --> 57:25.800
I didn't think that was true.

57:25.800 --> 57:28.440
That was the first time I ever heard it when I saw the tape.

57:28.440 --> 57:29.440
All right.

57:29.440 --> 57:32.400
Actually, I think I remember my brother telling me something about that.

57:32.400 --> 57:36.080
Well, me and my brother actually just was released from the Marines.

57:36.080 --> 57:39.280
Fireboma says, WTF, Mr. Rogers is a camper.

57:39.280 --> 57:42.920
Well, explain why you're so calm and quiet on the show, you know?

57:42.920 --> 57:43.920
Seriously, that's kind of scary.

57:43.920 --> 57:44.920
You have to have insane nerves.

57:44.920 --> 57:45.920
I'm going to Wikipedia.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
I'm going to Wikipedia right now.

57:46.920 --> 57:55.240
You heard about the girl, the young lady that they passed through sniper school who was,

57:55.240 --> 58:02.760
I want to say, an Air Force reservist because they can actually take combat.

58:02.760 --> 58:04.320
Okay.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.320
You know what?

58:05.320 --> 58:07.680
On Wikipedia, that whole thing is filed under urban legends.

58:07.680 --> 58:08.680
Here's what it says.

58:08.680 --> 58:12.040
Fred Rogers has been the subject of a few urban legends, among them ideas that he served

58:12.040 --> 58:16.040
in the military around the era of the Vietnam War, was a sniper, was a Navy Seal, or had

58:16.040 --> 58:17.040
a drug problem.

58:17.040 --> 58:20.840
Rumors to this effect are discounted as being false on urban legend websites.

58:20.840 --> 58:24.960
Not only is military service not mentioned on any biographies about him, but there wasn't

58:24.960 --> 58:28.240
a period of time unaccounted for when he could have been involved in such.

58:28.240 --> 58:29.240
Yikes.

58:29.240 --> 58:30.240
Maybe that's it.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.240
I need to give you Wikipedia to your friend.

58:32.240 --> 58:36.680
But he also was a Presbyterian minister and left the clergy to work with children.

58:36.680 --> 58:37.680
That's true.

58:37.680 --> 58:38.680
All right.

58:38.680 --> 58:43.140
Anyway, I just realized podcast listeners may not understand why we're suddenly talking

58:43.140 --> 58:44.420
about Mr. Rogers.

58:44.420 --> 58:48.080
We do a bonus segment when we tape live when we'll sometimes play things off of YouTube

58:48.080 --> 58:51.080
and such, and that was the subject this week was Mr. Rogers.

58:51.080 --> 58:55.080
So sorry, just for the podcast people's sake who maybe didn't hear that live.

58:55.080 --> 58:57.280
Anyway, anything else on your mind, Rama?

58:57.280 --> 58:59.960
I've decided not to buy a PlayStation 3.

58:59.960 --> 59:00.960
Why is this?

59:00.960 --> 59:07.760
I was watching, I was following like the Sony's podcast, live cast of the PS3 and everything.

59:07.760 --> 59:09.840
Now they're doing their version of Virtual Console.

59:09.840 --> 59:12.720
On that fact alone, I refuse to buy one.

59:12.720 --> 59:17.440
Well okay, but is it because you feel they're ripping them off or something?

59:17.440 --> 59:18.440
Yeah.

59:18.440 --> 59:23.120
They say imitation is the greatest form for flattery, but come on, Sony's been ripping

59:23.120 --> 59:25.080
off people left and right with the PS3.

59:25.080 --> 59:28.480
But couldn't you say that the Virtual Console is a form of Xbox Live Arcade?

59:28.480 --> 59:35.600
Yes and no, but the thing is the Virtual Console has all these classic games by Nintendo, whereas

59:35.600 --> 59:38.960
Xbox Live Arcade is like all these other arcade classic games in a way.

59:38.960 --> 59:39.960
Not totally though.

59:39.960 --> 59:40.960
It's not all Nintendo.

59:40.960 --> 59:41.960
It's like the shade of gray.

59:41.960 --> 59:42.960
Hold on, it's not all Nintendo.

59:42.960 --> 59:46.400
Sega's on board and Sega is supposedly going to be on board with the Xbox Live Arcade as

59:46.400 --> 59:50.740
well in those Sonic the Hedgehog teasers we saw previously.

59:50.740 --> 59:55.520
So remember that Virtual Console also has, you know, Turbo Grafx-16 and possibly Commodore

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
64 as well.

59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.400
True, but I just find it funny after Nintendo said they're doing this, Sony's like, oh,

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.040
we're going to do it too.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:08.880
Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know, but to not buy a system over it, I mean, what if they

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.880
did it better?

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.880
Eh, I just can't see myself, you know.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.440
And no, Zuko, I'm not a fanboy, I just don't have 600 bucks.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.360
There's the realistic reason why none of us are getting a PS3 at launch, at least I think

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.360
I can speak.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.720
Well, I don't know, I guess Jamie's getting one, but I know I can't afford 600 bucks.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.000
For 600 bucks, it better come with a lap dance.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.600
For 600 bucks, it better suck, never mind, I'm not going to finish that thought.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
Yeah, okay.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600
You know what I'm thinking.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.600
You know what I'm thinking.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.400
All right, anything else on your mind, Rama?

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.680
That's it, I love you guys.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680
Love you too.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680
Bye.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680
See you next month.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.680
All right, bye.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.680
Bye.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.840
That's right, I'm coming to New York City very soon, and I'll have details on where

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.360
I'm going to be and when, hopefully soon.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.760
I feel weird because now I think there's at least more than a handful of people that want

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.600
to come meet up, so I feel weird about doing that at a store like Unannounced, so I'm trying

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.000
to figure something out, creative, we can do, we'll see.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.800
I'll have to work with some people in New York.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.720
That'll be fun, though.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.600
Anyways, are there any other last minute stories that any of you guys have?

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.320
Thank you guys, by the way, all of you guys that called in tonight, and sorry to those

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320
we didn't get to.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.040
We're just running out low on time.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040
Not really.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040
All right.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.600
I have one quick story I wanted to share here from BamaniStyle.com, has posted a list of

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:35.280
Elite Beat Agents, a song list, at least partial, well, yeah, again, because apparently it's

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.440
being shown off on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, and they were able to get some of the songs

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.840
from the game.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.720
IMCA by Village People, Highway Star by Deep Purple, Rock This Town by Stray Cats, Walkie

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.840
Talkie Man by Stereogram, Makes No Difference by Sum 41, September by Earth Wind and Fire,

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.360
Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne, and I Was Born to Love You by Queen.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.360
All right.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.480
If you want to check out what stages those are related to, check out BamaniStyle.com.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.840
There's a more complete list over there.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.400
On that note, I guess we're going to end the show, so let's go around and get everybody's

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.400
final thought.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.280
Loki, your final thought?

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.920
I don't know.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.880
I ran out of milkshake.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.720
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.880
My final thought would be I need to adjust the sound on my new TV because it sounds like

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.680
I'm playing Beatmania in a tin can, and that's not fun.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.000
DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.360
Reject false icons, and Julie's meeting us for dinner.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.360
Sweet.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360
I need some dinner.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.180
She has my house keys because she had to feed my cat.

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:41.560
I need some big-time dinner action, so to do that, we have to finish the show.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560
Good night, everybody.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:49.560
Thank you so much for supporting independent internet radio, even when the hosts stutter.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.320
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.520
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.000
