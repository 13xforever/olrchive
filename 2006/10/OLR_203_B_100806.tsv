487	1368	Orange Lounge Radio
15436	19138	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19578	24259	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 203 for this, October the 8th of 2006.
24940	32903	If this is your first time tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, remember, or hear for the first time, that our show is released in two parts every week.
32943	36884	We tape live on Sunday nights and then split it up and release it to our podcast feed twice a week.
37204	43107	So if you want to hear all the news we talked about in part A, you've got to go download part A. But now it's time for part B, isn't it, Loki?
43327	43927	Yes, it is.
44831	48653	and, uh, as we mentioned in Part A, uh, Final Fantasy XII.
48974	51195	It's been pirated to the internet.
51595	52515	Not too surprising.
52636	57859	Games have been pirated before, but it's 30 days before the game is, you know, set to release in the United States.
58619	61320	And, uh, that's pretty interesting that it's pirated.
62381	67564	Yeah, so anyways, the ISO's leaked to torrent sites and, uh, various news group sites.
68645	69745	None of which I'm a member of.
70285	71006	And, um...
71676	76039	Yeah, and it's apparently legitimate from the people that have it.
77660	78000	Not me.
80121	81942	Yeah, it's interesting.
83403	86685	You should spend your money on the actual game.
87125	88946	Don't steal, because pirating is bad.
89306	90247	I'll review you next week.
92809	101072	Now wait, what I'm curious about is, you know, sometimes when albums get leaked early, like, I don't know, like, didn't the Eminem, his last album, get released early?
101352	104954	And so they had to actually bump up the street date of the CD.
105534	106954	Do you think that might happen with this game?
107295	107515	No.
107555	110736	I mean, if the game's already done and in the can, what are we waiting for?
110836	111316	Let's play it!
111356	112777	It's a review copy.
113517	115278	That's what got leaked, is a review copy.
115678	115898	Ouch.
116438	117778	You know what else has been leaked to the internet?
117839	118159	What's that?
118259	119099	In the Groove 2 beta.
119599	119879	Really?
120099	120279	Yeah.
121620	121740	Hmm.
122039	122400	DarkSakura.com
127873	130135	The gaming companies need to keep a lockdown on that stuff.
130155	131515	They do, and you know what?
131535	132996	All the journalists are going to be hurting.
133176	136618	No one to blame but themselves, because these are their copies that get leaked out.
137298	138339	What could they do to stop this?
138399	140560	Put serial numbers on them somehow, or what?
140720	146723	They could make them so they're only able to play on dev kits, and hope that the reviewers have dev kits.
146963	151926	Because, I mean, honestly, are you really going to have to fish for good reviews for Final Fantasy XII?
152166	152846	I mean, come on.
153587	155548	So, you could do that.
155648	156188	Watermark them.
156593	171726	So, you know, each individual copy, although I know it's going to be pretty difficult, each individual copy is watermarked so that you can check a certain, you know, byte signature or whatever and see, oh, Bill over at such and such gaming site leaked that out.
172346	173167	I'm going to kill him.
173567	175969	I'm going to sue him for $11 billion.
176270	176690	Exactly.
176750	182035	So, my take on this, you know, I don't know.
182195	184837	I think, great, you get to play three days early.
185679	186280	ESRB Don't Play Games
216544	221607	Aaron Ruby, the Underground Gaming Culture spokesperson, has a score to settle with the ESRB.
222028	226851	The ESRB has been independently applying and enforcing ratings and guidelines on online privacy since 1994.
227071	236478	The writer stated in his opinion column that the system applied to rating games should be different from those currently applied to TV and movies, which I disagree with.
236538	242502	I think if you want parents to know what the ratings are clear as day, make them the same as movies.
243055	243955	Anyway, well, oh well.
244735	246816	So anyway, how do they give out ratings anyway?
246856	248176	Well, they read and watch.
249016	255738	What happens is the game developers fill out a questionnaire on what the game's about and the game developers submit it with footage of the most extreme scenes from the game.
256218	266100	There are three trained raters, not expert game players, if you check out the website you'll see this is true, from the board and then they hand out the rating based on what they read on the form and see on the videos.
267358	277145	So according to the writer, quote, I find it alarming that the ESRB does not bother to base its ratings on the entire experience of playing a game, instead relying far too much on submitted clips.
277686	295719	Which is interesting because that doesn't surprise me because I remember, and I'm not going to say who this was, but I was at a conference, or I should say a media show once, and I overheard a developer saying about a game that featured a lot of cleavage in it, you know, and a lot of, you know, female...
296152	297072	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
315598	326187	but there's huge fines for lying and stuff as the makers of Grand Theft Auto are finding out, although I still to this day say they weren't lying, they were just careless and thinking they took out a portion of the game that they didn't.
326407	342300	And it's gotten so ridiculous now where they're, you know, rating content that doesn't exist in the game, you know, like Oblivion, you know, where they're rating it M because, yeah, underneath the virtual clothes there's virtual nipples, so I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
344062	344362	All right.
345495	350319	But some other interesting stuff, speaking of virtual nipples.
350879	360767	Playboy, you know, they've been doing this thing for the last couple years now, releasing the Women of Video Games spread in their magazine.
360827	364050	Yes, virtual naked women to oogle over.
365110	373337	And both Fleshbot and Kotaku have actually been running a preview picture of it, and we've got a list of the people that are going to be featured in there, as well as...
374380	401991	Well, let's see, such wonderful people as Sarah Morrison from Tabula Rasa, two of the women from the Scarface game, and we've got two women from God of War 2, and Alicia Claus from Bullet Witch, Dr. Yasmin Lin from Timeshift, and Erika from Splinter Cell Double Agent.
402171	403352	Bunch of babes I've never heard of.
403806	405527	Yeah, a bunch of games that aren't out yet, too.
405687	405967	I see.
406388	411871	So, very interesting, and that's supposed to be coming out, I guess, later this year.
411931	412731	Did you look at the spread?
413792	414172	Yes, I did.
414392	414893	Nice boobies?
416033	416694	Virtual boobies.
416734	421877	The one chick I thought, you know, when I first looked at it, I'm like, why did they put Blood Ring in it again?
421897	425619	Because, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games, so, I don't know.
426960	428361	I guess if you're into that stuff...
429457	430938	If you're into boobs.
431499	437122	Well, if you're into this, like, you know, virtual... Aren't they all fake boobs in Playboy?
437502	438263	I mean, seriously.
438463	440064	They're all airbrushed and everything.
440164	441145	I mean, what's the difference?
441405	442906	Virtual boobs or airbrushed boobs?
442926	443186	You know what?
443206	445447	These are probably more real than some of the pictures that are in there.
445567	447188	So, I don't know.
447308	449210	I guess that's cool.
449390	449750	I don't know.
450410	451971	Very early pictures still, though.
452432	457915	It's going to be a... They're going to have a two-page fold-out in the final version.
458470	460331	and 6 pages of gaming content.
461892	463013	And how many pages of boobies?
463633	464253	Lots of boobies.
464413	469136	I don't know, Playboy is a lot of ads and there's not that many boobies in that magazine.
469156	475219	Will you be picking up this copy of Playboy for the articles or for the research material?
475499	476460	I did last year, I think.
478561	480042	Your wife probably took it from you.
480222	480882	I think she did.
482947	487090	For those of you that haven't met Loki's wife, she's hilarious, that's all I can say.
487210	488431	She's had cameos in this program.
488451	492173	There was something else I was going to mention, because this was also on Fleshbot, linked to the same story.
492393	492714	Oh dear.
493714	502120	There is a Nerdcore 2007 calendar out starring Sherry Roberts, and there's one picture... Oh my god, my sister!
504141	504982	Bad joke, sorry.
505382	510365	Anyways, there's one picture, though, that I thought was funny, and I showed Rob this earlier...
511607	512848	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
541227	545750	and if maybe chicks wearing gaming accessories aren't your thing.
545770	546750	Do you think that's hot?
547371	548191	I guess it could be, yeah.
549092	550193	Do you think your wife will think it's hot?
550753	551894	Probably she'd think it's stupid.
551954	555336	But anyways, it says it's a limited edition.
555356	558878	They're going to have 2,500 copies.
558998	560219	They're $25 each.
560959	565682	Features 12 months of girls with a complete daily calendar grid and all that stuff.
566562	568364	They're pretty big and...
569468	570289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
591465	592506	GameDevelopersConference.com
614142	621426	Talk Like a Pirate Day, Tokyo Game Show, The Transformers, The Movie, Opening Day, and other flagship nerd videos.
625548	625688	Wow.
625708	626609	Who's putting this out?
626649	627249	Slashdot?
627969	632772	No, totallynerdcore.com is where you can purchase this calendar.
633412	636614	I gotta say, you know... Damn it, we need to get them on the show and get one of these models on the show.
636634	637274	Wouldn't that be awesome?
637654	640416	Yeah, that'd be totally awesome to have any model on this show.
640436	642897	Oh.
646161	649310	I don't know what else to say so let's move on from boobies to violence!
652037	653918	All the great games have either boobies or violence in them.
654738	655859	Violence, violence, violence.
655899	659140	This story coming from GamePolitics.com, our friends over there.
659540	665923	And it has to do with a question and answer session with the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.
666264	668505	His name is Richard J. Gellis.
668725	669765	And there was this interesting quote.
669785	677089	The question was, Excuse me, sir, but what is your opinion on video games and the lack of parenting to control the ever-increasing teen violence?
677509	677749	Answer.
678269	681831	Video games play almost no important role in teen violence.
682211	693618	Teens with a predisposition to being violent may be drawn to violent video games, but overall, other factors besides television, music, or video games are more important risk factors for teen violence.
693738	700562	Again, that quote from Richard Gellis, the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.
700642	703364	Also the Director of Center for Research on Youth and Social Policy.
703644	705025	So this guy does know what he's talking about.
705902	706502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
727822	730963	And it's actually going to be pretty much the same kind of stuff.
731263	734044	They've got your Brain Age score and stuff like that.
734344	738826	So imagine Brain Age minus the touchscreen and on your PSP.
739546	740566	That's kind of big news.
741226	741386	Yeah.
741606	747108	Because this guy, he was doing the DS stuff, and those games are huge in Japan.
747608	750689	And now he's kind of defected in a way to the PSP.
750729	755711	I don't think Nintendo's going to slow down their Big Brain series anytime soon, but kind of interesting.
756944	759666	I wonder what possessed him to do that.
759806	760026	Money?
760686	760986	Maybe.
761767	763447	There's more brain training games coming out.
763948	764248	I know.
764268	765849	What is that?
765889	768390	I think Majesco has two coming out in November.
770791	772432	Like Brain Wave, I think it was called.
773853	777274	Now it's just going to be like all those crappy Nintendogs knockoffs we got a while back.
777634	778315	Oh, God.
779198	781679	November is the month for Nintendogs knockoffs.
781699	785561	They've got the whole dogs, cats, hamster life, horses.
786081	789383	Uh-oh, I showed her to think what might be possible in a hamster life.
790244	794366	Anyway, let's move on and get some feedback from you guys, the listeners.
794746	798668	Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
798708	800909	And DarkSakura is typically here to read through the email.
801249	802630	But as you know, she's not here tonight.
802710	808773	So I'm going to instead borrow her asbestos suit and put on the gloves and dig into our mailbag.
812463	813284	Thank you for watching!
836565	839406	Alright, so this first email comes to us from Deekman.
839606	843947	Deekman writes, Hey guys, just thinking about the new next-gen consoles and had these thoughts.
844347	846428	One, the cost of the Wii at $249.
846668	854951	I think they chose to set it at this price not to make money, even though it is selling it more than it's worth, but for the simple reason that Nintendo doesn't want you to get any other console.
855251	861092	Just think for a second, with a $150 to $200 console, an Xbox 360 sounds mighty enticing to go with it.
861473	863553	But a $250 console plus games?
863913	865974	Suddenly that extra $360 doesn't look as good.
866354	877280	To back this up, I remember hearing a quote posted on Kotaku by Reggie that said something along the lines of, and I'm paraphrasing here, quote, I've heard of the Wii 60, but our users buy our consoles because they want a different experience.
877681	879342	If they want something else, they can get a DS.
879862	884404	Again, I'm paraphrasing, but it sounds like Nintendo is being smart with the pricing, if only to cut out the competition.
884424	885545	What do you think of that?
886526	887947	I don't know, that sounds pretty accurate.
889347	893810	I mean, it's an interesting theory, but I don't think that was a factor in the price point they chose.
895993	900776	was because it makes the 360 sound less appealing.
900876	901196	I don't know.
901236	905238	I think if they could make it cheaper, I think in the long run it's which system costs which.
905718	913082	So I think your average family is only going to get one console unless they have some hardcore gamers in the house, if even that.
913182	914403	So, I mean, it's a good thought.
914443	918725	Again, it's a good theory, and it may be right, but I just kind of think there's a lot of other factors that come into play.
919848	921049	Deekman also writes this, too.
921429	922650	Region-free PlayStation 3.
923330	930274	Not as elaborate as the last theory, but what if the reason Sony is making the console region-free is quite simply to combat mod chippers?
930654	937098	A strong case, and the one most used in courts, especially in Australia so far, is that people mod their systems to play import games.
937458	941561	What if this is simply a way to nip the next-gen mod chippers in the bud before they start?
941581	942581	What do you think of that, Loki?
944302	944683	Could be.
945083	946984	I think mainly...
948275	951837	You know, the whole HDMI being added to all the different systems and stuff.
951877	956579	I think that kind of ties in with it because now they can do the digital flag on all the movies.
957199	960340	And they might be able to do that with all the games now, too, if they have HDMI on there.
960580	965262	But I guess, you know, since they do give the option not to use the HDMI, that might not be the case.
965382	969584	But, yeah, region-free, I mean, I don't see why they don't.
969824	974406	I mean, when you think about it, because a lot of games, I mean, if you're going to import them, that's more sales for them anyways.
974566	974826	So...
975703	976965	I don't see what the big difference is.
976985	988198	I mean, granted you get stuff early, but it's not going to be, you know, it's only, it's not going to be translated for over here unless it already comes in both languages anyways, which why wouldn't you release them in both territories?
988639	988879	I don't know.
989517	991618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1019517	1020318	Keep up the good work.
1020378	1021500	Still listening, Dekeman.
1021880	1022461	Thank you very much.
1022781	1026647	As far as Canada goes, you know, it's a nice thought.
1026847	1031132	I'd love to maybe retire up there, but just for right now, there's too much going on for me here in the States.
1031273	1033235	But I definitely will be taking another vacation up there.
1034236	1034837	Probably next year.
1035078	1035318	We'll see.
1036363	1042326	Our next email comes to us from Malice, the artist formerly known as Stupid Baka, or so his signature says.
1064196	1066159	You folks still are awesome and I really like the show.
1066199	1069763	I love sitting in my room and doing my homework or talking to friends with the podcast in the background.
1070163	1075290	I also like your guys' quirky attitudes and witty remarks from time to time, especially those that belong to DarkSakura and Sky.
1075570	1076451	You guys make my day.
1076831	1078514	In other words, Loki, sorry, you suck.
1079274	1079695	Just kidding.
1080723	1081944	No, thank you, seriously, for the words.
1081964	1082604	I appreciate it.
1083225	1087487	I know this is a recurring theme of discussion on the podcast, and I was just wondering what you guys thought of this.
1088047	1091129	I'm a member of my school's mock trial team and have been since last year.
1091450	1097913	This year's case is People vs. Campbell, in which a student that is being bullied allegedly created a time bomb to blow up his school.
1098354	1105278	He's being charged with acts of terrorism, intent to murder, placing an offensive substance in a public place, and possessing a violent video game.
1106374	1117716	All the mock trial cases have pretrial arguments in which we argue to a judge about certain aspects of the case before it occurs, specifically in regards to evidence, the Constitution's Bill of Rights, and whether it shall be allowed during the case.
1118096	1125498	The defense in this pretrial argument will argue that video games are protected speech under the First Amendment, which is something I agree with, as do you guys, I assume.
1126318	1130799	This seems to be echoed as all the cases that they have given us that are relevant and have precedent
1131144	1132405	are all in favor of the defense.
1132785	1144990	This is definitely a change as most of the cases each year, especially in pre-trial, are made so that they aren't one-sided and can be argued both ways, ensuring for an exciting trial based on how good each side is, which is why I'll most likely be on the prosecution this year.
1145390	1150432	I was just wondering what you guys have to say about this as I know that you three are very vocal and have a lot to say about this issue.
1150912	1152132	Have a nice three-day weekend.
1152813	1154133	Unfortunately, it's not three days for me.
1154353	1155974	I have to work tomorrow even if it is Columbus Day.
1158095	1159515	Lucky you guys that get it off.
1161377	1166602	Anyway, I don't know much about the specific case that you're citing.
1166662	1171146	Just based off of other cases, I think you pretty much said what I feel.
1171466	1172727	I would agree with the fact that
1173420	1176002	Video games are a form of art.
1176242	1182646	I'm not talking about art as in a classic sculpture you might see, but it is a form of expression.
1182706	1183526	Expression is art.
1184267	1186848	It's no different than a movie or a CD.
1187489	1191892	I think, therefore, it should be viewed at very similarly by the public.
1192352	1194693	You know what I mean?
1194893	1201978	There are the people that criticize violent movies, and they probably do criticize violent games, but you can't say that a kid...
1203160	1209182	played a video game and that's what caused him to go crazy because what about the R-rated movies he might have seen?
1209522	1211742	Or what about the dirty music he might have been listening to?
1211822	1214743	But more importantly, what about the parents?
1216204	1217304	What about the home life?
1217724	1218524	Where was the love?
1218624	1219365	Where was the hug?
1219465	1220625	Where was the how was your day?
1221585	1225786	That's more important than the CDs, movies, or video games combined, in my opinion.
1227447	1228567	Loki, anything you want to add to that?
1229047	1230608	No, it's basically just bad parenting.
1231048	1231268	All right.
1236594	1238655	Black Boy says, Dirty Music?
1239616	1248400	Next email comes to us from Mr. Wonderful.
1249501	1250741	Hey guys and lady.
1251341	1252822	First off, thanks for putting on the show.
1252862	1255763	I emailed Sky earlier but figured that I should be thanking you all.
1255824	1258885	I recently graduated college and got a great job right after graduation.
1259244	1259544	DarkSakura.com
1287904	1290265	I've got to agree, though, that you really should play Pinball Quest.
1290345	1290665	And I will.
1291205	1293626	Even though she's not here tonight, I'll make sure she sees that part of the email.
1293646	1295027	I'm sure she will appreciate that.
1295467	1297048	And I will make her play Pinball Quest.
1297488	1300809	Anyway, forgive me if these questions have been asked, but I'm still making my way through the backlog.
1301169	1302250	On to a few quick questions.
1302370	1307212	First off, if you guys have the power to resurrect one franchise for a well-done remake...
1311102	1311943	What would you go for?
1312403	1319047	Maybe it's just the recent re-release on GBA talking, but I've got to think a Wii Bionic Commando would do the job pretty nicely.
1319548	1319868	Thoughts?
1320648	1321749	If it was 3D, maybe.
1323350	1324871	What game would you like to see Wii made?
1326577	1332739	Well, I know Kid Icarus is the obvious answer that most fanboys, I'm sure, would be foaming at the mouth for.
1332759	1334219	And that would definitely be my number one answer.
1334239	1339661	But as far as a GameCube game that I'd like to see on the Wii, I want to see F-Zero have another shot.
1339701	1342922	And I'm sure there will be some type of F-Zero on the Wii.
1343222	1345062	But I really enjoyed the GameCube one.
1345102	1351224	And I think it was a little bit underrated in part because the arcade version had one key flaw.
1351664	1363328	and that was the fact that there was really only the one model which was very expensive because the car moved around a lot and the fact there was only six tracks in the arcade and you can unlock them all in the home version.
1363928	1370490	I think there was a lot to still be discovered with that concept that I think unfortunately in the execution kind of fell apart.
1370790	1375992	But the whole driving with the Wii stick might be kind of interesting in F-Zero or something.
1377194	1380617	At least even with the slightly souped up graphics and sound, I would like to see that.
1380657	1382458	And the sound coming out of the controller.
1382779	1385060	I'm really looking forward to a new F-Zero game.
1385180	1386241	And online, please.
1387522	1388743	Anything, Loki, you can think of?
1389424	1391045	It's kind of hard.
1391065	1392706	I don't really know.
1395188	1397790	What could we do that would be really awesome?
1400512	1400973	Let's see.
1402334	1405116	Drunami says Capcom seriously needs to put Okami on the Wii.
1406307	1407588	Yeah, that's not a remake, though.
1407808	1409249	DMN says Kirby's Dream Course.
1410069	1410809	That might be kind of fun.
1410849	1412390	You could actually swing the ball.
1412430	1414371	That was a fun game on Super Nintendo.
1415632	1416012	I don't know.
1416132	1419794	I'd say just remake.
1419934	1420574	Make a good...
1422409	1424590	Even like a Castlevania would be kind of cool.
1424730	1426992	A good Castlevania for 3D.
1427012	1429033	Make it like a first person shooter would be kind of neat.
1429193	1429433	Really?
1429473	1430453	I want to see them do the 2D.
1430473	1432274	I got excited by the 2D news last week.
1432395	1434156	You can have a 2D Castlevania too.
1434896	1438958	Just maybe Blaster Master maybe?
1439258	1439899	No, that's hot.
1440539	1442120	Alright, let's go to the next email.
1442540	1443881	Hey guys, it's NeoDude.
1443941	1445782	Belated congrats on 200 and all that.
1445962	1449124	I just wanted to talk about the Sonic demo on 360 for a moment and why it sucked.
1449424	1451325	Oh my god, I played that actually now.
1452112	1452493	What'd you think?
1453155	1453737	It sucked.
1454239	1455945	It was just like horrible controls.
1456487	1458434	I couldn't even make it over the first jump because...
1459261	1462264	It was just veering off to the side when I had tapped the button to the side.
1463284	1464726	The email continues from NeoDude here.
1465066	1466827	The big thing was the camera sucked.
1467168	1470090	Sonic has always relied on good camera control and it's not here.
1470430	1479157	Plus, the demo gave Sonic everything he had at the end of Sonic Adventure 2, including the bounce bracelet, which leads to many unexpected deaths, especially when you're trying to light dash in the air.
1479618	1487144	If they include a window that tells you what the X button does at any time and fix the camera and maybe take out the bounce bracelet, everything else should be alright.
1487324	1488145	Catch you next episode.
1489414	1490595	Well, I hope they change something.
1490875	1495139	I know they've been getting negative feedback around the web, and who knows, it may result in a delay of the game.
1495339	1497901	I don't know, but it would be nice to see them go back and change things.
1498061	1498422	We'll see.
1498962	1504507	Well, I think what they should do is have an option when you're running straight to be able to strafe a little bit.
1504567	1505968	They need a strafe button in it.
1506349	1515516	So, like, when I'm running straight, you know, ahead, I'm not, like, going to, when I try to, you know, be a little off on the rings there, I'm not going to all of a sudden veer off to the side.
1515537	1517218	That's what they need to fix.
1517475	1524021	All right, this one, last email tonight comes to us from Laser123454321, and he writes this.
1524121	1525622	Hi, Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura.
1526003	1530967	I first want to thank you for giving the Bomani community its first podcast as well as your general game coverage.
1531027	1531728	Read, you rock.
1532408	1536732	I like all the politeness, like the fluffing of the egos in the first paragraph of all our letters tonight.
1536792	1540256	No, no, seriously, we love the fact that you guys are so receptive to it.
1540316	1540716	It's awesome.
1541560	1545084	Second, I would like to get your in-depth view of the new DDR Supernova for PlayStation 2.
1545905	1558678	Just to tell about some of the experiences I've had, the new Stellar Master Mode far outshines the Dance Master Mode of DDR EX and EX2, as the majority of the unlocks can be done just by completing the first few trials in each Stellar joint and then facing the showdown.
1559138	1561521	I personally play Controller Controller Revolution.
1561641	1563463	We call it Button Button Revolution, but that's fine.
1563903	1567507	So I like to face the Diamond EX Showdown or EX Showdown in each joint.
1568548	1570890	Anything you want to say additional about DDR Supernova, Loki?
1571070	1571751	I haven't played it yet.
1573253	1576656	I did play it a little bit, and I agree.
1576956	1580520	I gave my fuller review on last week's program, so you can go back and download that in Part A.
1581202	1588025	But I definitely think it's a solid entry into the series and will give you lots of new songs.
1588065	1592868	I like the song list and I do agree that Stellar Master Mode is an improvement on the mode they had last year.
1592888	1595249	But I didn't despise the mode they had last year so much.
1595829	1602492	I felt it's okay to have the really, really hard songs kind of tricky to unlock because they're extra, they're bonus.
1602512	1604673	They're supposed to take a lot of effort to unlock.
1604953	1606694	But I think they did do a little bit better this time.
1607652	1608273	Other questions.
1608973	1612416	One, what do you think about the song list as compared to the other US releases?
1613516	1614697	I think it's a pretty good song list.
1615538	1617639	I do too, but Max 2 is still my favorite overall.
1618200	1620021	Just, you know, as an old school DDR fan.
1620041	1622943	But I do think it was better than Extreme 1's song list.
1623904	1625545	Two, what are some downfalls with the game?
1627246	1632350	Link mode disappearing was an interesting thing that was a bit of a downfall of the game, I think.
1633451	1633591	Um...
1634167	1635368	Other downfalls for the game.
1635828	1638269	Oh, the fact that they got rid of a lot of the videos.
1638409	1642951	I don't like the whole dancer in the custom-generated background or whatever.
1643351	1649474	One thing I liked about DDR was some of the art backgrounds they had, and I always kind of looked forward to seeing some of the ones they came up with for new songs.
1649494	1651995	It's kind of not there in Supernova.
1652015	1661379	This is a stupid request, but one I made before I went on Extreme 2 is not being able to put in edits on...
1662876	1668083	for the eye toy stuff, like you can't put in hand things on your edits.
1668904	1670165	That would have been cool if you could do that.
1670326	1677955	Granted, hardly anyone actually uses it, but how hard would it be to put that as an option for your edits?
1678416	1679397	I don't understand.
1679477	1681760	Three, what do you think about Konami bringing back Battle Mode?
1683574	1686495	I think it should be more prevalent in their next release.
1686555	1690216	I think they should really explore what they can do with versus mode.
1690496	1695578	I used to say this way back when the show was strictly about Bomani games and we had the three hour show.
1695958	1698779	I think the future of DDR was in a versus mode.
1698839	1701780	I would like to see more competitive style play and options.
1701840	1709863	So I think it's a good step in the right direction but I'd like to see that option more fully researched in the next release of DDR and do more with it.
1710463	1711163	So just a thought.
1712278	1714359	4.
1712318	1714359	What is your opinion on the online controversy?
1714399	1718101	For those that don't know, the game features a few songs that are online only.
1718441	1725825	That is, you cannot play songs that are exclusive to online play in the free dance mode offline, even after having played them in the online mode.
1726205	1732508	Some have speculated that when Konami shuts down Supernova online play, like they did for Extreme 2, that these songs will be lost.
1732889	1737531	Others believe that when this happens, Konami will reveal an unlock code for the songs for offline play.
1740248	1743811	I don't think it's the doom and gloom most people are shouting about.
1744091	1745192	It's something extra.
1745392	1747694	And what if you have an Xbox that doesn't go online?
1747935	1749956	There's many great songs that you're missing out on.
1750016	1755161	Now, granted, I see the difference because you can download those songs and play them offline whenever you want.
1755581	1764709	But I would speculate that if there's a Supernova 2 or whatever's next, which I would find it hard to believe there's not going to be at least one more PlayStation 2 game next year...
1765349	1770973	I would bet almost anything you're going to see those five songs in the default song list for next year's game.
1771873	1773974	So I don't know anything.
1773994	1774955	That's just speculation.
1775355	1777056	But, I mean, it would make sense.
1777837	1781339	And then people wouldn't complain about repeats so much because they didn't really have them in the last game.
1781359	1786942	What if they're just going to be unlocked at a time unlock type thing?
1786982	1788103	Like they're going to be unlocked...
1788894	1790915	on a certain date, say, when the other games come out.
1791736	1792316	I don't think they are.
1792596	1793837	I seriously think this is it.
1793897	1795357	I don't think they're ever going to be unlocked.
1795397	1798479	I think online only is online only, and I think that's it.
1798659	1801260	That's until someone puts out a code for it.
1801501	1802001	That's true.
1802061	1803121	Someone might hack a save.
1803181	1807804	And to be honest, the content is there, so true.
1808364	1808844	So who knows?
1809144	1809505	Why not?
1810185	1813987	All right, lastly, and finally, for those involved in the Stepmania community, Loki might want to read this.
1814414	1815636	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1831528	1838332	have expressed interest in doing a Supernova theme, and Takuya will start work as soon as he has rips from the Supernova disc.
1838692	1843834	I believe K Eternal is waiting for StepMania 4.0's theming engine to be finalized before he starts work.
1844295	1852859	It's not that hard to rip stuff off that disc, and to be honest, it's funny how I mentioned in the Groove 2 beta had already been leaked.
1853539	1860323	They've already made tools to basically re-skin it, re-put songs in it for your own stuff like they do in the Groove 1.
1861132	1868040	So, you know, it's going to be possible pretty soon just to do all that stuff pretty easy.
1868300	1874907	I mean, hell, they've already automated the whole ripping of In The Groove stuff, you know, off of this once the game comes out.
1875288	1878071	I have to be honest, I'm just not that big on playing DDR on my computer.
1879011	1879891	Well, this is the thing.
1880352	1897800	With the Indigroove rips that you can do in the editing, you can actually either, if you have a modded PS2, you can dump it to a disc and actually play it on the PlayStation 2, or if you have a hard drive like mine does, you can dump the ISO to the hard drive and play it off of that, and you can actually play your DDR on PlayStation 2.
1898921	1899201	All right.
1899625	1903426	Well, that's going to do it for the Mailbag this week, and lots of great emails this week again.
1903466	1904906	Sorry to those we didn't get to tonight.
1905226	1909928	If you want to send us an email, it's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1910008	1911788	Let's go to the next story.
1911828	1912588	Loki, excellent.
1913348	1924731	Well, the big story this week is, well, one of the big stories, Mark Raine is basically saying that the second-gen game, Gears of War, on the 360 looks better than the first-gen PS3 titles.
1925031	1927872	And, you know, he's sort of right on some of those, but...
1929229	1935073	Sony says their next generation starts when they say so, I say bullshit.
1936114	1940656	And basically stating that the next gen will start when that game comes out.
1941497	1941857	I don't know.
1942738	1945039	Whatever, big talk, but we'll see.
1945479	1948001	Sounds like people just kind of whipping it out back and forth.
1948221	1948781	Yeah, exactly.
1948802	1951123	Typical PR, trying to slam the other guy type stuff.
1951844	1957887	Alright, well, speaking of the Xbox 360, of course, when Doom came out, a lot of people were like, where's Duke Nukem?
1958267	1960668	If you're going to bring us Doom, you need to bring us Duke Nukem.
1961608	1965910	Well, there was an interesting post by a staff of 3D Realms.
1966430	1968091	Quote, you'd be surprised what they've turned down.
1968391	1971732	Don't just assume MS will want it just because you like it and it's popular.
1972032	1975594	Hate to sound defeatist, but it's not as easy as send it to Microsoft and get it on there.
1975899	1976460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1996929	1997709	Thanks for watching!
2016621	2017201	Oh, come on.
2017221	2018962	They can release two games in one day.
2019403	2020103	I have a hard time.
2020123	2027447	Their schedule is so book solid when things keep getting pushed back and we have to get things like, you know, the Project Gotham deck for Uno to hold us over.
2027887	2031649	I mean, if they're so booked, why don't they release something else that's ready to go?
2031669	2032850	Release two games in one day.
2032970	2035011	Is it going to kill the server that much?
2035191	2035732	I mean, come on.
2035752	2037973	Well, I think they're afraid that one game would outshine another.
2038253	2042255	That's why they don't release like 10 or 15 at a time because they want all the games to have a fair shot.
2043136	2043716	Does that make sense?
2044176	2045017	No, it doesn't make sense.
2045037	2045577	That's stupid.
2046178	2046498	Duke Nukem 3D
2071465	2071785	I don't know.
2071865	2072826	I don't see what the big deal is.
2073046	2080469	I think what the big deal is, they don't want to work on it because they're not fucking done with Duke Nukem Forever yet, and to be honest, just put the damn thing out.
2080549	2081929	It's never going to be perfect.
2082510	2083570	You're never going to finish it.
2083870	2088272	The generation of hardware is just going to get better and better each time you're about done.
2088992	2090353	It's just, it's never going to happen.
2092034	2092334	Anyways.
2094175	2098296	Some other interesting stuff, though, like Duke Nukem 3D, you know, had pretty good multiplayer.
2098316	2099977	Well, another game that has really good multiplayer...
2100578	2105301	Lost Planet, and we will be seeing a multiplayer demo this winter, which is pretty cool.
2105561	2110444	So, yeah, looking forward to that, probably in November sometime, would be my guess.
2111365	2114327	You know, I wasn't that big on Lost Planet when I played it.
2114927	2116909	I don't know, I'm not sure what all the hype's about.
2116949	2122532	Maybe it's just not my kind of game, but maybe a multiplayer would change my mind, if I had a lot of fun with that.
2122792	2123032	Yeah.
2123293	2124493	Are you more excited about this game?
2124513	2125954	Did you enjoy the first demo that came out?
2125974	2126955	I liked the first demo.
2127055	2129317	I'm not sure if I'd buy it, though, right away.
2129397	2129677	I mean...
2130737	2134419	I think about that time I'm going to be busy with the Wii.
2134659	2137480	I'm not sure if I really want to buy this game right away.
2137500	2138580	I mean, it was a cool game.
2139161	2140461	Don't get me wrong.
2140481	2141602	It looks really good.
2142662	2146804	I really don't need to be buying that many games now.
2148585	2150026	Well, let's do another story here.
2150046	2152447	This one is regarding Full Auto 2.
2153127	2159990	It's going to be releasing some PS3 online details.
2160934	2167381	Apparently the developers behind Full Auto 2 actually released some of the details about what online is going to be all about.
2167841	2170504	And it was on this Radio PM podcast.
2171004	2175969	The Full Auto 2 producer Mike Gallo from Sega of America talked about what was going on.
2177210	2184112	and OPM asked, so when you go into Network Play, you'll see sort of a browser and they say when you first turn on the machine, it logs you in automatically.
2184452	2186132	I think you can change that in the settings.
2186412	2189773	You have a user ID and an online profile that's set up through the PlayStation.
2190073	2191493	We don't have anything to do with that.
2191753	2193414	That's all done through the PlayStation Network.
2193714	2199495	When you log in and as long as you have an ID and you're an active online member, when you go into the online mode, you get a menu option.
2199515	2200995	You get to pick ranked or unranked play.
2201295	2203876	Then you'll see what games are available and then jump into one of those.
2204436	2205216	Kind of interesting.
2205780	2206621	There's more information.
2207001	2209243	As far as stat tracking, is it all within full auto?
2209303	2210023	Is that outside?
2210724	2215807	When you play Ranked Play, your stats, pretty basic set of stats, wins, losses, will get uploaded to GameSpy.
2216228	2221772	You'll be able to see, I think we have it sortable by, it's worldwide and monthly or all time, so you'll get to see who's ranked where.
2222172	2226555	You'll be able to access it from our website as well, so you can look at those stats independently of the game.
2227333	2228193	Achievements are big on 360.
2228833	2231614	Did you guys think about throwing in that concept for PS3?
2232054	2234215	We actually do not have that in Full Auto 2.
2234555	2237316	It's a feature we had to regrettably not support.
2237676	2241377	A lot of it was just because of that moving target with the development timeline.
2241697	2246338	We had to make sure our online modes and network play was solid before we added some of that other stuff.
2246718	2248939	Unfortunately, that was one of the things we had to drop.
2249640	2254202	Kind of interesting, though, if that means that there's not really going to be achievements like we know it on the 360.
2254523	2257684	It's just going to be on whatever games that they want to support it on.
2258124	2259685	That's kind of big news, I guess.
2260826	2261206	I don't know.
2261226	2262327	I guess they could patch it later.
2262347	2263247	That might be kind of neat.
2263627	2264528	All right.
2264868	2265148	All right.
2265208	2269490	Well, we're going to go now to a new segment, which is a new game.
2269690	2271031	We're going to play a new game tonight.
2271091	2273252	So, Loki, you know I'm going to sucker you into playing this game.
2273272	2273833	You ready for it?
2275053	2275333	Sure.
2275513	2275894	All right.
2276134	2277735	No, you'll like this game.
2277935	2278275	Okay.
2278315	2278555	All right.
2278894	2282476	and we thought we'd bring on a contestant of our choosing tonight.
2282816	2283696	Caller, are you there?
2284457	2285017	Yes, I am.
2285217	2286577	Hi, and who is this?
2287298	2288458	This is Bobby from Atlanta.
2288698	2290219	Hi, Bobby from Atlanta.
2290499	2294321	Hey, is this the same Bobby that does his own show on Sunday nights on another network?
2294921	2295601	You know it is.
2295782	2296302	Of course.
2296642	2307847	See, now there's a reason why I invited Bobby to be the first one to play this show or to play this new game here on the show is because, you know, there's been a little bit of smack talking in the past between, you know, Loki and
2308157	2315081	and Bobby and Chromehounds, which never happened, and these whole, you know, oh, we're going to play each other at these games, and it never really happened.
2315721	2316162	No, it didn't.
2316382	2323426	So I decided we here at Orange Launch Radio would provide an opportunity for there to be a great podcast war, if you will.
2324206	2324466	Okay.
2324727	2325007	All right.
2325267	2326207	So are you ready, Bobby?
2326227	2327288	Are you going to kick Loki's ass?
2328229	2328709	Yes, I will.
2328909	2329209	All right.
2329830	2330850	He sounds quite confident.
2331430	2331931	Two words.
2332311	2333872	Shenanigans.
2334052	2334632	Shenanigans.
2334692	2335673	Shenanigans.
2336352	2341495	Alright, well, we're going to play a brand new game and it's called the Video Game Showdown.
2347038	2348199	It's horrible music, dude.
2349920	2355603	I have no reason why we're using the Press Your Luck theme for this, but I just wanted an excuse to use the Press Your Luck theme at some point during the program.
2355623	2356143	I don't know.
2357137	2360518	The Video Game Showdown is a brand new game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2360578	2363378	Here is how it's going to work.
2363518	2368619	First things first, no fair using Google or the internet to cheat at this game.
2368839	2371760	Some of you people can do your research mighty fast, so no fair.
2371800	2372580	You're on your honor.
2372980	2374340	Okay, Bobby, I want a fair fight.
2374360	2379261	Am I allowed to at least write things down?
2379321	2380321	Yes, you can write things down.
2380341	2381241	That's certainly acceptable.
2381261	2382022	You just can't research.
2382042	2383922	You have to be on your own here.
2384540	2385721	All right, so this is how it's going to work.
2385761	2392006	I'm going to read you a list of ten items in a category, but only five of them actually apply.
2392466	2395948	So you have to guess which five are the correct answers.
2396889	2398050	Here's tonight's category.
2398130	2411720	Tonight's category is, per the website Video Game Charts, five of these games are the top five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.
2412521	2412721	Okay?
2412741	2412821	Okay.
2413120	2420086	So tonight's topic is the top 5 best selling worldwide, keyword there, worldwide DS games to date.
2420626	2421487	You ready for the list?
2422487	2422748	Sure.
2423068	2423608	Alright, here we go.
2424289	2425730	Here's your 10 options.
2426390	2441903	Animal Crossing Wild World Brain Training Mario & Luigi Partners in Time Mario Kart DS Metroid Prime Hunters New Super Mario Bros.
2443382	2451626	Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris DS, and WarioWare.
2452266	2459489	Again, of those ten I just named, five of them are the best selling worldwide DS games to date.
2459829	2462190	Here it is again one more time real quick and then we'll get the answers.
2462650	2464331	Animal Crossing, Brain Training,
2464693	2476802	Mario & Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart DS, Metroid Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Bros., Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris DS, and WarioWare.
2477663	2478503	Loki, you about ready?
2479184	2479564	I am ready.
2479804	2480265	You're ready?
2480665	2480825	Yeah.
2481025	2481345	All right.
2481886	2482146	All right.
2482166	2483487	What's the five you're going to pick, Loki?
2483767	2493414	The five I'm going to pick, Animal Crossing, Braintrain, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario Bros., and Nintendogs.
2493875	2494195	All right.
2494540	2495721	Bobby, which five are you going to pick?
2496541	2505967	Okay, my five are Brain Training, Mario DS, New Mario Bros., Nintendogs, and Super Mario 64.
2506667	2507808	Alright, there they are.
2508268	2512191	So very similar lists, only one difference between them, and that could be the make or break.
2512511	2517474	Now here's what happens, if we have a tie, and Bobby and Loki have the same amount correct...
2518220	2525165	Then Bobby can either change one of his own answers after I tell him how many he has right or he can force Loki to change one of his.
2525685	2526966	So that way we prevent a tie.
2527687	2531790	So let's first check the correct answers and see if we have a tie tonight.
2533091	2536573	And it looks like we do not have a tie tonight.
2537274	2537594	All right.
2539175	2540296	Bobby, we'll start with you.
2542017	2542558	You got four right.
2542578	2542838	All right.
2544515	2545596	4 out of 5 right, not bad.
2545656	2550737	Brain Training is correct, Mario Kart DS is correct, New Super Mario Bros.
2550777	2552758	is correct, and Nintendogs is correct.
2553118	2553499	Those are 4.
2554319	2557620	But Loki, that bastard got all 5 of them right.
2557940	2558560	Hell yeah.
2559161	2559981	I can't believe it.
2560301	2561341	I was concentrating on Japan.
2561361	2561762	Did you cheat?
2562042	2562622	No, I wasn't.
2563314	2566056	I concentrated on thinking about what was popular in Japan.
2566737	2567457	Alright, that's right.
2567477	2569099	The top five selling games of all time.
2569259	2574983	Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario Bros., and Nintendogs.
2575023	2577145	And because they also packed in New Super Mario Bros.
2577905	2578646	No, actually, no they didn't.
2578666	2579426	No, it wasn't a pack-in.
2580227	2581348	So I was a good guess from Bobby.
2581428	2582889	Actually, it's a trick though.
2582929	2584670	Mario 64 was actually number six.
2585491	2586652	So it was really close.
2587313	2590475	Yeah, my reasoning was just because it was one of the few games out when it launched.
2590751	2591852	Yeah, no, it was a good guess.
2592312	2595533	I guess Animal Crossing, yeah, was kind of a surprise, but, you know, the game was really big.
2595753	2596554	Pretty much around the world.
2596574	2597995	I mean, they're making a movie based on it.
2598035	2598435	Come on.
2598815	2600796	It's got to be pretty big.
2601256	2601616	All right.
2601856	2602857	Well, good job, Bobby.
2603057	2603817	You did really good.
2603877	2604938	Four out of five is not bad.
2604998	2607219	And who knew that Loki had this superhuman power?
2607539	2611241	I guess I should have guessed, you know, since he works in distribution, you probably know something about sales figures.
2611941	2612902	I cry in shame.
2613122	2613862	I'm sorry, Bobby.
2614042	2614663	But you know what?
2614823	2616644	Hey, we'll give you a chance to plug your show.
2616704	2619405	You have something you want to share about what's going on on the Bobby Blackwolf show this week?
2620160	2620981	The Bobby Blackwell Show
2640040	2640800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2667245	2668105	We've got newbies.
2687632	2689093	and community chats and stuff.
2689394	2690134	Oh, very cool.
2690154	2691115	Well, what nights are those on?
2691135	2693016	Do we have a set schedule for that yet?
2693117	2698261	Yeah, XBL radios on Tuesday, Evil Avatars on Wednesday and Game Addict Oddlines on Thursday.
2698581	2699221	Very nice.
2699702	2701023	Well, congratulations to those guys.
2701043	2704746	We're happy to see them on board and we'll be looking forward to that over at allgames.com.
2705266	2705406	Yep.
2705727	2705967	All right.
2706087	2713393	Bobby, thanks so much for playing our little game tonight and next time I'll do a topic, you know, maybe about like video games in Atlanta or something that Loki couldn't get.
2714674	2716055	There wouldn't be five things in that.
2718044	2721926	Wait, I thought Atlanta was like one of the top five cities for gaming, like right under Seattle.
2721946	2730151	It is, but you know, it's like in terms of video games being based here, I think like Midnight Club 3 was here and that's about it unless you count like sports games.
2730491	2731892	Hmm, interesting.
2731972	2736715	I guess they just sell a lot there because you guys have to stay indoors because it's so damn humid outside.
2737816	2739017	It's not the heat, it's the stupidity.
2739157	2739437	All right.
2740337	2741838	Bobby, thanks so much for playing our game tonight.
2741858	2742379	We appreciate it.
2742399	2743059	Have a good one, all right?
2743579	2743879	You too.
2744120	2744480	All right.
2744740	2746501	Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, ladies and gentlemen.
2747179	2751521	from AllGames.com does his own program over there Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
2752402	2754583	A lot of our live listeners actually listen to his show.
2754623	2757864	It's like a bit of a warm-up before they come over to Orange Launch Radio, so that's pretty cool.
2758164	2758785	That is pretty cool.
2759065	2760345	All right, let's go back to the news.
2760646	2761046	All right.
2761446	2764587	Well, we were talking about games being leaked out early and stuff.
2764728	2769710	Well, this has to do with mod ship and HD loader programs out there.
2770270	2775553	And, well, actually, some of the major ones were actually...
2776519	2779361	Nailed for over $9 million recently.
2779982	2791191	The ESA announced that a federal court in California ordered a group of defendants to pay over $9 million in damages for violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
2791712	2805503	And the violations were against Divinio, the maker and distributor of mod chips for all consoles, French resident Max Lohm, and Canadian resident Frédéric Leggett.
2806532	2812394	for trafficking of mod chips and software circumvention device called HD Loader.
2813174	2833839	And yeah, it's basically, of course, the HD Loader, for those who might not know, was a device that was available on the market for a while, allowing you to dump games to a hard drive built into your older PlayStation 2, whether that be one that you provide or the official Sony hard drive, and you can put games on there.
2834395	2834915	I have one.
2835275	2837936	I love my HD loader because it allows me to play import games.
2839277	2841578	And it just loads things faster, too, on the HD loader.
2841638	2842218	It does load things faster.
2842278	2844159	I like just not having to switch out the discs and everything.
2844299	2845159	And I love it.
2845219	2847620	You know how a bachelor pad looks around the TV?
2847740	2852842	There's discs everywhere outside of their case because they're all too damn lazy to put it back in the right case.
2852862	2858585	What I like using it for is when I used to, before I got my 360, when I used to take my PlayStation 2 to work to play games...
2859881	2862302	I didn't have to carry around like 50 discs with me.
2862362	2863823	They're all dumped to my hard drive.
2863903	2869126	So I can just, you know, bring my PlayStation 2 and a couple controllers and the hookups and away I go.
2869587	2871508	And plus the load times were a lot less.
2871868	2873329	So, and DDR, it was awesome.
2873349	2875250	It was just like instantly into the song.
2875310	2879192	So, um, I don't know, but it's gotten worse since then.
2879212	2882834	You know, before, you know, when I first got it, you had a cap of 120 gigs.
2883354	2884455	Um, you can pretty much use now.
2884535	2888157	Now you can, it supports the two terabyte drives that you can hook up, um,
2888564	2889465	via USB.
2890045	2890345	Wow.
2890565	2894068	Yeah, it's so... I mean, you can literally put almost every single game out there.
2894088	2897930	Yeah, but you can also go rent games and then load them on your HD loader and then you have them forever.
2898230	2901052	Yeah, not that you'd know anything about that, would you, Loki?
2901132	2901792	No, I wouldn't.
2903413	2905094	I'm beyond renting games nowadays.
2905435	2905715	All right.
2906195	2908717	Who needs to rent games when they're freely available on the Internet?
2912119	2912899	Loki, Loki, Loki.
2914300	2914881	There is a...
2915640	2916881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2935845	2941169	So just because it's releasing late in Europe doesn't mean you won't have an impact here in the United States.
2942389	2947913	Now, that's 500,000 PlayStation 3s that were expected to go to Europe at the end of this year.
2948293	2951696	Now, that's 500,000 less consumers to sell games to.
2952136	2960682	So publishers are probably going to delay games that they previously were going to release this year to 2007 just to take advantage of the greater user base in Europe.
2960962	2962903	So we all get screwed by this.
2962923	2964684	Isn't this kind of what you were saying earlier?
2965885	2967386	That's for a whole different reason.
2967426	2973852	That's for the fact that they haven't gotten their dev kits in a timely manner, and so they're not able to finish the game, period.
2973872	2987824	No, I'm talking about earlier in the program, you were talking about how sometimes, or I should say, like say the Wii sells 9 million units, I think you said this in Part A, then that's 9 million available systems for people to want to publish for.
2988064	2988464	Yeah, exactly.
2988484	2989465	Isn't it the same logic here?
2990346	2991967	In a sense, yes, but
2993021	2999444	You can't really apply, like say if there's 500,000 units in the United States, that doesn't mean they're not going to release a game here.
2999864	3004446	If there's no systems obviously in the UK, they're going to delay the launch of a game there.
3004546	3010349	But just because Europe doesn't have their game system yet does not mean that they won't launch their US copies here first.
3010429	3015631	So not only will Europe get screwed by the release of the system, but now all their games are going to be delayed six months because of this.
3015971	3023552	No, they'll just come out when the PlayStation 3 launches instead of just, you know, being launched at the same time.
3023572	3030654	I mean, the same thing happens with, you know, different region games like Tomb Raider will come out in the UK first and then it'll come out over here.
3031034	3038255	It does not mean, you know, if, for example, we could release, you know, PlayStation 3 games here first and then just wait to release them there.
3039175	3043976	It doesn't matter because they need time anyways to, I guess, you know, print more copies.
3044375	3055244	One interesting thing, though, I have to add to this, was that there was an interview with the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe World Vice President, Jamie McDonald.
3055444	3060007	And he claims that Europeans don't mind that they have to wait an extra four months for the console.
3060548	3065992	And they asked him, what would you say to consumers who like Sony and want to buy your product?
3066816	3070739	but perhaps feel because they're in Europe they will always be last in line.
3071139	3079045	And he says, European consumers have shown that historically they don't mind that because they end up buying as many PlayStations if not more than the U.S.
3079105	3079645	and Japan.
3080106	3083908	In Europe, it doesn't seem that the release of our platforms after the U.S.
3083948	3086530	and Japan in the long run affects how consumers feel.
3087931	3091754	I think some of our listeners over in the old country might feel a little different.
3093215	3093795	I don't know, guys.
3093815	3096177	Is it just me or do you feel a little different than what this guy is saying?
3096485	3098906	Yeah, so, I thought that was very interesting.
3099606	3104648	So he's saying basically, well, since Europe usually gets screwed, you know, we're kind of used to it.
3104688	3108829	You know, they're assholes stretched out now, it doesn't matter if we fuck them again.
3109089	3112451	So, that's pretty much what it comes down to.
3112471	3117953	So, anyway.
3117993	3118493	Wow!
3119593	3121174	Wow, um, damn.
3124997	3126320	Loki says the darndest things.
3127182	3128585	It's like kids say the darndest things.
3128726	3134679	All we need now, we're just missing Bill Cosby and we've got another show all...
3137912	3140173	I want to say this real quick before we get into the next story.
3140333	3143174	There's something I wanted to talk about that for whatever reason isn't on the show roll.
3143554	3146736	It was actually kind of a busy week for news with the whole GameStop conference and everything.
3148056	3149917	The system's coming out soon.
3150517	3152618	There was a story, an opinion piece.
3152919	3155980	Does Sony need a figure like Major Nelson?
3156400	3160542	Because, you know, Major Nelson is sort of like the internet guy for the Xbox 360.
3160602	3164564	And, you know, he kind of, you know, in a way, he's kind of a viral campaign in a way.
3164584	3165045	You know what I mean?
3165065	3167426	Like, you know, he starts buzz on his blog.
3167486	3169247	And, you know, he's a popular guy.
3169307	3171288	He's on the system playing the games.
3171348	3173449	People have run into him on Test Drive Unlimited and stuff.
3173949	3178332	And you go over to Nintendo and you have very charismatic folks like Reggie.
3179232	3179993	Oh, we love Reggie.
3180413	3182394	And Miyamoto, you know.
3182714	3183915	But Sony has...
3184952	3196161	These guys, like, you know, as Jamie calls them, the crayon eaters and bike helmet, which, by the way, the photoshops in our forum that you guys did, fucking hilarious.
3196221	3197082	We have the best listeners.
3197122	3201045	Seriously, guys listening, if you've never visited our website, you must go to the forums just for this.
3201085	3205949	The people doing the photoshops of the amazing crayon eaters over at Sony.
3205989	3206309	It's great.
3207290	3211313	But anyway, Sony, you know, has these guys that make these crazy statements like this.
3211814	3214176	You know, does Sony need somebody a little more...
3217039	3218280	What they need is Willy Wonka.
3219541	3219861	Why?
3220361	3223744	Because it's going to take some fucking magic to sell those consoles.
3224784	3228707	Anyways, some news about Oblivion on the PSP.
3229007	3231628	And we knew that there's got to be some catch to this.
3231788	3235391	They're not going to be able to put Oblivion that we saw on the 360 on the PSP.
3235411	3236331	There's no fucking way.
3236832	3239873	So what we did find out, though, according to the...
3241363	3242203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3264114	3264955	Is any of it new?
3265275	3267796	Or are they just recycled dungeons from the existing Oblivion?
3268096	3268656	I have no idea.
3269236	3271537	If so, I mean, what the hell is the point?
3271577	3276299	It reminds me of those Game Boy Mortal Kombat games, which are fucking horrible compared to the console ones.
3276359	3281140	It's like, you know, we had to take out half the moves because there's only two buttons and things like that.
3281321	3288263	I mean, granted, the graphics for this Oblivion look kind of nice, but this is a game that should just simply be played on the big screen.
3288963	3289824	Or on a computer screen.
3290124	3290884	Yeah, I'm
3291997	3292317	I don't know.
3292517	3300263	I don't know, but... I will suspend disbelief until I actually get to play, get my hands on it and actually play it, but I worry about this whole concept.
3300303	3302825	I mean, at least to... Why not like a little spin-off story?
3303325	3305867	Do some slightly different dungeons and do like a spin-off story.
3305907	3308189	I think that would be a lot more... Yeah.
3308649	3309410	Well... Wantable.
3310390	3313893	It's... It's interesting, but I don't know.
3315474	3316755	The game itself looks pretty.
3317195	3319637	I mean, not as good as, obviously, the 360 one, but...
3321308	3322448	I don't know, it looks okay.
3322528	3329930	And like you mentioned, cutting out skills and stuff, 18 of the original game's 21 skills are going to be in the game.
3330570	3331710	A couple of them stripped out.
3333390	3337871	I don't know, it's basically... Why don't they just release a 3D version of Diablo?
3337911	3343492	It's kind of like what this game is almost like, where you pick up items and just kind of grind at it.
3343892	3346033	Oh, I'm sure Diablo 3 will be something we're hearing about in 2007.
3346193	3348413	That's just my thought.
3349371	3352654	I swear I have not been ignoring you, chat room, over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3352674	3353235	Click on chat.
3353255	3356317	My mind just got distracted with trying to set up that game and everything a little bit ago.
3356638	3360941	But it looks like Bobby Blackwolf is actually campaigning right now to be the voice of Sony.
3361462	3363083	So he'll get up there and be the voice of Sony.
3364404	3367086	I'll send you some Crayolas, Blackwolf, so you can start practicing.
3367326	3370789	And then DMN follows up with, Nokia needs Bobby Blackwolf.
3371490	3373752	You know, the N-Gage needs a spokesman, too.
3374092	3376094	The problem with this, I mean, they...
3377063	3383948	I really have trouble with them pushing games like the Eye of Judgment because it's going to take an elaborate setup to get to work.
3384229	3386791	And to be honest, the Eye Toy didn't work all that great.
3387491	3404184	And just a lot of the games that are coming out at launch, like Resistance, okay, it's a first-person shooter that takes place during World War II, which also happens to come out at the same time as Call of Duty 3, which is a first-person shooter that takes place during World War II, granted one's sci-fi, I mean, whatever.
3404790	3407012	Dragon Riding Game, Eragon, MotorStorm, EA Sports Games
3428567	3429127	and Carbon.
3429267	3431068	You know, you first speak Carbon, which is actually a pretty cool game.
3431088	3431588	Play the demo.
3432228	3434668	Um, and then the 2K sports games.
3435509	3440530	But, like, as far as exclusive titles, I mean, there's not a whole lot.
3440550	3448352	And that's, I think that's really gonna hurt them more than the fact that the console's three, you know, fucking expensive and that there's not that many units out there.
3448372	3457414	I think that there's, you know, people that are, like, actually gonna want, I mean, there'll be people that pick up the console, but a lot of people are like, well, I'm just gonna wait until some more games come out.
3457894	3458194	I don't know.
3459043	3461325	Sony fans, if you feel differently, send Loki an email.
3461485	3467790	Mailbag at orange.radio.com Meanwhile, let's move on to something for the Nintendo fans, and this is a little bit more disappointment.
3467830	3471112	I mean, we already heard about the consoles are definitely going to be region locked.
3471152	3471873	Well, guess what?
3472533	3480179	Eurogamer talked to a Nintendo UK spokesperson, and they confirmed that the Wii Virtual Console games will also be region locked.
3480620	3483722	The Virtual Console games will also not be universal.
3484332	3486273	I want to play the original Metal Gear or Gartic Metal Gear here
3511269	3514551	No, but the old school MSX, it was on the MSX before it was on the NES.
3515252	3522357	Well, and the true sequel to Metal Gear was not Snake's Revenge, but the true sequel to Metal Gear was only on the MSX.
3522697	3527300	But I get, well, they had the whole PlayStation 2 secret thing, but whatever, I want it on the virtual console.
3528180	3528441	Gimme.
3529902	3531102	That's why I sound depressed, sorry.
3531743	3537647	I'm not too worried about it, I mean, big deal, I didn't play a lot of the import games on the NES, and whatever, I mean...
3538086	3540709	It's not like they were going to put all the games on there anyways.
3540729	3545173	I mean, so, you know, do I really need a Japanese version of Zelda on there?
3545453	3545614	No.
3545894	3549618	Ranma speculates maybe you can get a Japanese Wii Connect 24 account.
3550659	3552721	Blackboy says he was looking forward to Doki Doki.
3553481	3553642	Right?
3553662	3555684	Doki Doki Panic, the inspiration for Super Mario Bros.
3555744	3555684	2.
3555784	3556264	That is true.
3556284	3559988	I mean, well, the consoles themselves are probably region locked, but I'm sure you could probably like...
3560464	3562804	Disable it or change that to something else, you know?
3562824	3566365	Well, it's very easy to get a Japanese Xbox 360 account, so maybe that same logic.
3566625	3569146	But at the same time, it's hard to pay for that, you know what I mean?
3569606	3576327	Like, you can't really... Like, you only get the Japanese account so you can download their free demos and trailers, but you can't, you know, buy things on their store, really.
3576527	3579647	Well, luckily that there's no real money involved.
3579727	3584328	It's basically the Nintendo points cards, or points, and you know what?
3584348	3585268	You can still do that.
3585668	3587469	But what if the points cards are region locked?
3587849	3588009	No.
3588029	3588509	Only the American...
3588886	3590447	No, the points cards are just universal.
3590968	3602436	And what's interesting, though, see, like, there is going to be some Xbox Live games that are exclusive to Japan, and I was going to buy them on my one account because you can actually play them on your, you know, US account, too.
3602536	3607420	So I would download the demo on my Japanese account and register them on my US account.
3608055	3611218	GS68 says, I want the Famicom version of Gradius 2.
3611318	3614121	See, all these great games that really didn't ever come over here.
3614542	3618345	And Nintendo, I think you ought to reconsider this.
3618465	3622790	Or at least, if you're going to do this, please give the U.S.
3622830	3624952	gamers a shot at some of these games they never played.
3624992	3626734	I bet there's, you know, money to be made there.
3626754	3629256	Well, I think a lot of this, though, is going to be to eliminate confusion.
3629276	3631859	I mean, if you're a normal consumer out there...
3632772	3638695	What if you don't want to download the Japanese version of a certain game and you might accidentally do that and then you've wasted your money on it?
3638715	3640536	Well, mark it very clearly.
3641637	3648761	There's no amount of clear marketing that's going to stop stupid people from injuring themselves or downloading something they shouldn't be.
3648901	3649881	Alright, I'm done being emo.
3650962	3653423	There's nothing more you can do, but whatever.
3654384	3655745	Some interesting stuff, though.
3656085	3661648	Reggie over in Tendo there is contradicting some of the info we've gotten about the pricing for the
3663734	3665515	You know, the web browser for the Wii.
3666056	3674439	And, you know, his comments were basically, in fairness for the Americas, we haven't made the business decision for how and what we're going to do with the browser.
3675120	3677201	We recognize for most people, browser is pretty standard.
3677221	3682343	The concept of charging a significant amount of Wii points to get the browser is somewhat challenging.
3682743	3683844	We're going to work through that.
3684684	3688586	So, basically saying, you know, we haven't announced anything yet about it.
3690560	3691261	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3714881	3716862	Wemo is an expensive piece of equipment.
3716882	3717522	It's what, like $50?
3718062	3717522	$40?
3718342	3720483	$50 it's retailing for?
3720503	3720483	$39.99.
3721343	3729606	$39.99.
3721643	3729606	So it's very interesting that a third party is going to jump in and try to make their own version of the Wemo, but usually third party controllers aren't quite as good as first party.
3729946	3734908	For me, I kind of go, uh-oh, if I were Nintendo, I'd be concerned about this because this is kind of like market saturation, isn't it?
3734928	3736248	Well, they're the ones that have to approve it.
3736968	3737609	I guess that's true.
3738629	3739729	I bet it won't come out right away.
3740290	3740790	That's for sure.
3741630	3742310	I don't know.
3743311	3744111	Great, but...
3745521	3748066	Nintendo will sue!
3758317	3767343	There's some controversy now, it's about the dumbest things too, about the light on the front of the Wii surrounding the disk drive, whether it's going to be on or off.
3767824	3774448	And during the Nintendo Fusion Tour, there's actually, the light was completely turned off.
3774788	3777390	And some people are like, well, hey, I want my light on, what the hell?
3777990	3779972	So, here's my theory on this whole thing.
3780652	3783114	Basically, what they've come out and said, the rep,
3783686	3791171	was that the light's only going to be on when you put a disc in or when you turn the console on and that it's going to turn off later on.
3791311	3800516	I think there's either going to be an option to keep it on or the fact that probably those games that you were playing weren't running on that Wii.
3800576	3806180	They were probably running on a dev kit that was below the Wii and that the system just wasn't plugged in.
3807313	3811496	Now, I was going to say, when we went to the Konami thing, didn't we see Elebits?
3811536	3812937	The thing was glowing the whole time?
3813017	3813637	Yeah, exactly.
3814338	3815859	But of course, that same logic could apply.
3815879	3816940	It could have been hooked up to a dev kit.
3816960	3817600	It doesn't mean shit.
3817660	3823244	And they could have just had the console plugged in and turned on and so the light glows.
3823344	3827607	But if it's hooked, you're actually playing off of a dev kit and not the actual system.
3827747	3835412	So, I mean, in theory, you could just, if you're limited on plugs or whatever for power, you could just not plug that in and just set that there because...
3836018	3837259	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3864590	3880825	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or you can always pick up the phone and call us 916-226-9067 Can't remember if I mentioned it last week but there is an 800 number coming soon because the number we have now is not toll free but by the end of the month we're going to have a toll free number which is very exciting.
3880865	3882406	I'm very much looking forward to that.
3882833	3885034	and then we'll have a lot more folks wanting to call in, I'm sure.
3885134	3893559	We'll probably bring back voicemails of the week at that point because we think more of you guys might want to contribute if you have a toll-free number to use because most of you are just too lazy for Skype, I guess.
3893659	3894479	Let's go to the phones.
3895119	3896520	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3896580	3897000	Who's this?
3897861	3898501	Hi, it's Ranma.
3898521	3899021	What's up, guys?
3899181	3899702	Hi, Ranma.
3899722	3900102	How you doing?
3900122	3900602	What's on your mind?
3901503	3902443	Not much, not much.
3902703	3907686	I was trying to record the last part of the show so I just got back from another anime convention.
3908126	3909507	Another anime convention?
3909527	3910247	Which one this time?
3911228	3911828	It's Manga...
3912330	3916092	It's nothing but a convention about mangas and fans and stuff like that.
3916493	3917453	So no video games?
3918414	3926899	Yes, there were no tournaments, but let's just say older gamers like us would have cried tears of joy at the games that were there.
3927580	3928160	What did they bring?
3929421	3932563	Well, we saw a working Nintendo set up with Super Mario Bros.
3932583	3932563	3.
3933063	3933563	That's pretty hot.
3933603	3934664	Did they have Guardian Legend?
3935685	3936705	No, they didn't have that.
3936725	3939527	The older guy that ran the game told them next year.
3940107	3941208	Alright, that works for me.
3942009	3944271	Anything else you want to share about the con?
3944391	3944711	What else?
3945731	3951615	It was fun, and it was basically drama-free, because everybody just had to have a good time.
3952015	3954117	Nobody bashing Orange Moms Radio to you this year?
3954137	3957619	No, not this year, not this year.
3959680	3963703	We love our anime fans that go to the conventions and then bash us to other people.
3963763	3964263	That's lovely.
3965043	3966064	No, I'm just teasing.
3968065	3969206	It's cool, whatever, you know.
3969673	3971174	People have their varying opinions.
3971194	3973835	There's about 500 video game podcasts out there.
3973855	3975456	If you don't like this one, go find another one.
3975476	3977537	Just keep it independent is all we ask.
3978878	3979579	Definitely.
3979639	3980019	Of course.
3980179	3981180	Alright, anything else you want to share?
3982981	3991385	There was a few Super Nintendo set up, a couple of Playstations, and yes, there was Guitar Hero on the big screen.
3992226	3992726	There was what?
3994207	3995708	Guitar Hero on the big screen.
3996148	3997249	Oh, Guitar Hero on the big screen.
3997289	3997949	How did that go over?
3998936	3999796	That was pretty nice.
3999917	4005079	That and DDR Extreme 2 were like the top, part of the top five.
4005119	4010662	You also had Not Ultimate Hero 4 and Battle Station DLN are also popular.
4011763	4011983	Hmm.
4012804	4013104	Alright.
4013364	4013524	Well.
4014565	4016706	Alright, well we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, okay?
4017486	4017846	Excellent.
4018007	4022449	Alright, have a good one and we hope for some more old school gaming goodness at the next con.
4023309	4023770	Damn right.
4023910	4024190	Alright.
4024230	4024470	Later.
4024670	4024990	Later.
4025791	4027812	Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.
4028291	4029531	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4029571	4029971	Who's this?
4030651	4032112	Hey, this is El Mullet calling.
4032392	4034232	Hey, we remember you.
4034292	4036132	You haven't called into this show in a long time.
4036173	4037033	How are you, El Mullet?
4037513	4038913	I am doing just fine, Sky.
4038993	4039873	I'm doing just fine.
4039913	4041574	Have you ever called into the podcast?
4041594	4042194	I don't think so.
4042654	4044734	No, this is my first podcast call.
4044754	4045734	Your podcast debut.
4045774	4048115	I know you used to listen to the three-hour show back in the day.
4048815	4049255	Oh, yes.
4049395	4050535	That was fun times.
4050575	4052596	Now, from what I mean, yeah, crazy random times.
4052656	4053136	No, that's great.
4053336	4054556	We love our history.
4055366	4057407	Now, you're getting married next week, right?
4057767	4058408	Yes, I am.
4058568	4059448	Yes, I am.
4059508	4060849	Congratulations.
4061389	4062309	Is she a gamer?
4063990	4064450	Slightly.
4064590	4065351	I am learning her.
4065871	4066131	Okay.
4066231	4066491	All right.
4066831	4067252	That's good.
4067292	4069573	There's got to be compromise in a relationship, right, Loki?
4069833	4070233	Right, Loki?
4070633	4073374	We're mostly DS playing.
4073634	4075475	We do New Super Mario Bros.
4075515	4077796	vs. We do Tetris vs. Okay.
4078316	4078917	Well, that's cool.
4079117	4079477	That's cool.
4080077	4081258	What did you want to call in about tonight?
4081278	4081538	What's up?
4082324	4083565	I'm basically wanting to say hi.
4083605	4084266	It's been a while.
4084806	4085487	It's your hand.
4087208	4089030	Are you still doing your column over at Inside Pulse?
4090111	4093254	Actually, I've quote-unquote left Inside Pulse.
4093274	4095676	There's just been a lot of stuff going on.
4095696	4096557	I see.
4096997	4098238	I'm trying to find work.
4098759	4100300	There's obviously the marriage thing.
4100840	4102342	I mean, things have just been...
4104361	4109002	Lots of stuff has been going on, and I've been trying to catch up on everything.
4109362	4110102	I understand.
4110182	4112103	Lives go through chaos sometimes.
4112243	4113383	It's fully understandable.
4113723	4115083	What games have you been playing recently?
4115103	4116403	Did you check out DDR Supernova?
4117184	4117984	Oh, yes.
4118004	4119564	I've been having a blast with that game.
4119584	4125785	There are a few songs I could have done without, but I like the setup of Stellar Master Mode.
4125845	4129366	I really like the fact... I think it's the best...
4132397	4132898	What's the word?
4133279	4134341	Console licenses.
4134521	4139189	I think it's the best lineup thus far, especially songs like The Other Side, Turn Up the Music.
4140551	4140691	Um...
4146089	4149310	How do you think the game compares to the other PlayStation 2 releases that are out there?
4149330	4150090	Because it's kind of interesting.
4150110	4156672	I was just at Target the other day, and they had a DDR Supernova bundle right next to Extreme 2 bundles they still hadn't sold.
4156752	4163515	So definitely options are still available to the new DDR folks that want to get on board with this.
4163535	4164795	How do you think it compares to the other ones?
4166257	4173540	Well, I definitely think that it's definitely on par with Extreme 2 as far as best US PS2 mix.
4173960	4179923	There's definitely stuff in there that make me go, wow, this is much better.
4180183	4183745	But then there are other things that make me go, hey, it was better in Extreme 2.
4184445	4188367	Like I think the chorus mode, we got shafted with chorus mode this time.
4189862	4197074	Because there's only one difficulty level on everything, whereas last game, you had two difficulty levels on everything.
4197615	4198155	Interesting.
4198516	4201501	What do you think about how the new Xbox games are shaping up?
4202169	4203789	I think they're shaping up really well.
4203909	4207330	Your podcasts are definitely making them more favorable by the day.
4208030	4208991	I appreciate that.
4209431	4210991	I'll let Konami know you said that.
4212291	4219253	No, seriously though, if you were still reviewing games for the website, how many stars out of 10 would you be giving DDR Supernova?
4220013	4223854	DDR Supernova, well, that would be under the 10 category review system.
4224174	4229115	I gave Extreme 2 a 7.5 and said that was the best one ever.
4231489	4234151	which is like a 9.0 on other websites.
4234572	4246061	So I would say that Supernova would range between a 7.0, 7.5 because there's stuff that's better and there's stuff that's worse.
4247302	4249323	So it would be around the same score, I would think.
4249484	4250164	Yeah, what's up with that?
4250384	4258791	You brought up an interesting point is that a 7.5, the way you would review games, and if I wrote game reviews, I would hope I would be very similar as well where like, you know, an
4259321	4262543	Average game gets an average score in the middle.
4263263	4266725	But it seems like most game websites, you're right, kind of skew it towards the high end.
4266765	4268286	Here's what I get.
4268386	4279212	For example, games that are reviewed on IGN, they'll have a score for each category and then a score that doesn't have anything to do with any category on there.
4279272	4287017	So, for example, a game might score seven fives across the board on all the other categories and get a six overall.
4287237	4287457	I'm like,
4288018	4289479	Okay, how the hell is that average out?
4290119	4293261	Or I'm thinking about like on Rotten Tomatoes, like, you know, because they cover game reviews.
4293281	4303687	They don't do it quite as well as they do movies, but it says we only give a fresh rating if the site gave it a 7 or better because of the skewed, you know, people tend to give higher scores on game reviews.
4304187	4305088	Why do you think that is, Emily?
4305108	4305448	The problem is...
4306388	4315772	The problem is that so many of these numbers are pulled directly out of their asses, and most of these numbers don't even correspond to what the written opinions are on the game.
4315812	4323254	I've seen 7.0s on some sites, on some game reviews, and the bottom line is, don't play this.
4325815	4328216	It's the way that Inside Pulse reviews games.
4328536	4330457	It's out of a 10-category system.
4332531	4337995	and it could really excel in some areas, but there are other areas that could bring the game down.
4338055	4341057	A game could have a great story, but horrible graphics and sound.
4341077	4345881	The game could have great gameplay mechanics, but it can only be fun for the first three hours.
4348923	4354607	Basically, the games have to be really awesome in all categories to get 8 and above.
4355007	4357309	But a game can be worth playing at a 7 or even a 6.
4359590	4360691	Alright, yeah, that's true.
4361423	4372909	I was going to say, I hope to see that you come back to the internet soon reviewing games and sticking to the more realistic scale that you started over there.
4373309	4378031	You just might see a Supernova review before the end of the week, assuming I have enough time.
4378271	4378832	Very cool.
4379192	4382493	Well, Elmoled, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for calling in.
4382994	4383334	Thank you.
4383534	4384094	Have a good one, buddy.
4384554	4384835	You too.
4384975	4385495	All right, bye-bye.
4386035	4386235	Bye.
4386715	4389157	How exciting, a wedding, getting married and all that fun stuff.
4389197	4389897	Let's go to another call.
4390560	4391741	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4391781	4392161	Who's this?
4393862	4395563	Uh, Ultimate Gamer from Chad.
4395583	4397144	Well, I'm currently not in chat right now.
4397484	4398884	Alright, well, hello, Ultimate Gamer.
4398904	4399605	What's on your mind, buddy?
4400906	4404087	Um, yeah, I'm just, uh, thinking about the Xbox 360.
4404147	4407389	Now it has a $200 HD DVD drive.
4407409	4416474	And, um, uh, like, am I just gonna have to, like, should I just get a PS3?
4417796	4426719	because since the Blu-ray drive is implemented into the PS3 and games are actually on Blu-ray discs.
4426879	4427240	Gotcha.
4427320	4427880	Okay, I see.
4427980	4429440	This is where you're going.
4429520	4430281	Here's the thing, though.
4431601	4435723	Are you interested in just playing movies with this device, or are you going to be playing games as well?
4437103	4444206	I mean, I'm mostly getting the PS3 for games, but I know the Xbox 360 has some good games.
4444526	4444746	Right.
4445046	4447087	The PS3s are actually on Blu-ray discs.
4447398	4452001	I think it really boils down to, you know, which console has the games that you want.
4452381	4461186	And, you know, Microsoft gets a lot of heat usually because they overlook, or at least they have in the past, they don't have a lot of solid role-playing type games.
4461206	4462927	They don't have a lot of solid action games.
4462947	4469370	And they've been trying to correct that, you know, you got Blue Dragon coming out and they, you know, they had Cameo, take that for whatever it's worth.
4469410	4472372	But, you know, Sony's always kind of excelled in that range.
4472657	4476480	But on the flip side, Sony doesn't seem to have a strong lineup right now.
4476760	4479302	So you have to kind of look more into the future at what Sony's got.
4479482	4482164	And Microsoft is trying to correct themselves.
4482224	4483986	And you kind of saw that with Tokyo Game Show.
4484226	4486267	They're trying to take a more broad approach to different games.
4486568	4491191	So you really have to ask yourself, which of these two systems is going to have the games I want to play?
4491471	4495875	Because remember what we always say, the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4496255	4499277	And when it comes down to the whole... I guess here's another question I have for you.
4499678	4501279	Where does the we stand in your mind?
4501539	4502740	Do you not care about the Wii?
4521277	4529007	So I would say take that same logic and put it on Xbox 360 versus PlayStation 3 because it's not really going to matter, you know, Blu-ray, HD, DVD, whatever.
4529067	4530629	It's going to be really about the games in the end.
4530889	4531590	I'm going to be honest.
4531610	4533793	I've seen Blu-ray and HD, DVD side by side.
4534093	4535395	It's really not that much different.
4536297	4538619	The spec-wise, they're about the same, too, other than data.
4539119	4561294	But I do understand what you're saying, is that Sony, and I do agree, this could be to their advantage in three years, is that Sony has the native Blu-ray support for the games, and while right now it's causing the system to cost your firstborn child, later on, when we get further down within the subdivisions of this generation, that could really benefit them in the end.
4561834	4561954	XBOX 360
4576718	4580302	It's just like, you know, having an HDTV will make the game high definition.
4580502	4581243	True, that's true.
4581523	4588350	But also, don't forget the other part I'm trying to say here is that, you know, doesn't it boil down to how good the games are, though?
4588690	4593215	Not necessarily how they look, because, you know, being on Blu-ray, certainly they're going to look better.
4593475	4598881	But if you're going to buy a Wii, then you must already be into that school of thought that it really is about the fun games.
4599841	4613149	And granted that Blu-ray does have more storage available to it, doesn't mean though that they'll use it all, and also doesn't mean that the games that are on DVD-9s are going to look any less brilliant than, say, a PlayStation 3 game.
4613229	4614830	Look at Gears of War and Resistance.
4615270	4615971	Perfect example.
4616011	4617812	They both look very good, and
4618211	4618912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4643311	4646235	I'm just messing with you, but, you know, I know you're probably right now.
4646275	4649839	You want one this year, and maybe you'll get the other one next year?
4651521	4651882	Probably.
4651962	4653303	I know I'm getting the Wii first.
4653343	4662775	I mean, PS3, I get a couple months down the road, but, you know, I think, you know, the games, they should be like, you know,
4663248	4666210	I think... But also good graphics.
4666410	4666571	Right.
4666811	4667371	And you know what?
4667431	4668532	I think you're on the right track then.
4668572	4679720	You know, if the Wii is... It sounds like you really, really, really want the Wii, you know, then go for that, buy that, and then when you have enough money saved up for a second console, look at the games that are out and or coming out and make your decision at that time.
4680581	4680801	Yeah.
4681001	4681341	Alright.
4681462	4681682	Alright.
4682711	4685412	Thanks, really love the show, and great RSS feed.
4685432	4689474	I listen to it on my PSP every week, and I get no buffering signs or anything.
4689814	4690134	Love it.
4690595	4695077	I'm glad to hear there's people still using OLRPSP.com, so Loki, go update it.
4696037	4696397	All right.
4696417	4697358	Thank you.
4697378	4697978	We appreciate it.
4698238	4707962	I know sometimes we give the PSP a hard time on this show, but it is a great multimedia, multi-platform system, and we're really glad to be able to offer our podcast on it.
4708923	4709183	All right.
4709223	4710103	All right, have a good one, buddy.
4710804	4711084	Bye-bye.
4711104	4711604	All right, bye-bye.
4712193	4712933	That was a good call.
4713954	4715774	Alright, let's go to another call here.
4716655	4718075	Alright, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4718115	4718475	Who's this?
4720836	4724618	Uh... Oh, I... Am I on?
4725218	4725718	Yes, you are.
4726038	4728379	Oh, sorry about that.
4728479	4729379	It's Legend of Zakum.
4730220	4730700	Hi, buddy.
4730740	4731400	What's on your mind?
4732460	4733741	Uh, Digital Lice next week.
4734101	4736742	I know it is, and I'm not going... I'm missing it by a week.
4737342	4739103	Oh, it's... Wait, wasn't it this week?
4740060	4741861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4765029	4772411	I mean, Nintendo's doing a lot of good things with the Wii, but then all the good things end up turning up sour, you know, when you really think about it.
4773111	4778973	The whole having to lock down, you know, region, regioning on, you know, the games and the virtual console.
4779593	4781754	Isn't that going to hurt them in the long run?
4782094	4786695	Well, I agree it sucks and all, but, you know, the NES was region locked too.
4787616	4791497	Yeah, but that was easy to get, you know, it wasn't as hard.
4791757	4792377	That was Zen.
4793101	4797886	I mean, when you have the PS3 being region free, couldn't they just compete on that?
4799492	4801353	I gotta be honest with you.
4801973	4809977	I know the folks that listen to this show because the way myself, Loki, and DarkSakura are is that we are focused a lot on import gaming.
4810257	4813319	And we really do enjoy a lot of the games that come over here from Japan.
4813639	4818862	So from our perspective, yeah, it's really fucked up that Nintendo's not supporting the region.
4819302	4823504	If you had a single version of a game without having to do any porting,
4825974	4835461	Any extra work in trying to localize it to a particular country, you know, rather doing the language as a first time, would that make more sense than just releasing one copy?
4836321	4839504	Well, that's a lot of work, though, because you have to do all those different languages and things.
4839544	4847509	I mean, if it's got to have French for parts of Canada, Japanese... But that's, you know, but just keeping that in the single source.
4849270	4853393	Maybe, but here's... Okay, here's my other question for you would be then...
4855720	4865029	About the Wii, what about the greater gamer culture out there besides just us, the rabid import gamers?
4865049	4867451	Are they going to give a shit?
4867511	4870654	Casual gamers won't give a crap about what we're bitching about.
4871415	4872676	I mean, that's a fact.
4873316	4875458	Casual gamers just want to play, period.
4876059	4880263	And so what the Wii does is gives them that opportunity to just play.
4880894	4883255	which is basically Nintendo's banking on right now.
4883355	4888757	They're just banking on the casual gamers to pretty much dominate this holiday season.
4888898	4892839	So my question is, in the big picture, will it really make a difference that they've region locked out?
4893600	4894160	Not really.
4894280	4901603	It would affect some, but then Nintendo wouldn't care because our niche minority is not their bottom line.
4902083	4904965	Their bottom line is about everyone, the casual gamer included.
4905665	4905785	Hmm.
4907193	4908734	Interesting comment in our chatroom.
4908814	4910796	Ari Massen says, I'm a large importer.
4910856	4914038	I might buy two Wii's just to play both Japanese and American games.
4914338	4916019	Well, Nintendo just won off you.
4916900	4919821	Well, that's basically what people did when the PS2 first came out.
4919841	4920502	Yeah, that's what I did.
4920902	4923163	Hey, Sony made it twice off me, so whatever.
4923784	4925605	And, you know, who knows?
4925705	4929387	There might be a way to just crack the Wii like they did with the GameCube to play imports.
4929628	4930128	Well, we'll see.
4930448	4932730	And so you've got to give those opportunities time.
4932770	4933010	All right.
4935586	4937507	All right, Zach, any other thoughts for our listeners?
4938647	4944650	Basically, New York people, Digital Life, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
4946130	4948031	Where's a good meet-up spot at Digital Life?
4948751	4950672	Basically, I'm not really sure.
4950712	4952973	Maybe in the front lobby of the Javits Center.
4953273	4957735	Or maybe inside the DDR tournament area.
4957815	4962537	All right, so Orange Loungers, be at the DDR machine Saturday at noon.
4964318	4964598	All right.
4965506	4966447	The OLR meetup.
4967388	4971050	Yes, the OLR meetup right there with the DDR tournament.
4971270	4971590	Alright.
4972011	4972871	It's Saturday at noon.
4973051	4973692	Alright, have fun.
4973732	4974032	Be there.
4974873	4975113	Okay.
4975133	4975833	Alright, later, Saku.
4976594	4976914	Bye.
4976934	4977374	Bye-bye.
4978055	4978755	One more call.
4980316	4980837	Last call.
4980877	4981897	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4981917	4982258	Who's this?
4983038	4983418	It's DMN.
4983459	4984159	How's it going, guys?
4984179	4985560	Goddamn, you get through every week.
4986641	4988542	I know, and I keep paying you, you know.
4988822	4989983	Alright, well, what's up, DMN?
4990795	4995337	I'm actually calling with a... Well, now having heard that last call, I have something else.
4995417	4999438	But the first thing is a little brief review of Clubhouse Games for the DS.
4999959	5001039	I want Clubhouse Games.
5001079	5004220	I totally forgot about this game until somebody was talking about it in chat earlier.
5004240	5007702	Dude, the only reason I want to get this game is because you can PictoChat over the internet.
5008142	5008762	No, you can't.
5009422	5009922	Oh, fuck.
5010123	5010423	That's it.
5010443	5011143	I'm not buying it.
5011623	5012343	Fuck you, Nintendo.
5012363	5013144	That's what you get.
5015565	5018106	You can PictoChat over local Wi-Fi while you're playing.
5018126	5019006	Well, I can do that already.
5019844	5022626	Well, you can't do PictoChat while you're playing a game, though.
5022646	5024048	I can do it while I'm playing Ping Pals.
5025069	5027030	Well, I'm sorry you bought that.
5027651	5028351	No, it was a gift.
5028872	5032155	It was a very nice gift, but fuck that game, seriously.
5032315	5033976	I'm sorry that that was bought for you.
5034076	5037579	That's like, no, no, no, I mean, it was a very sweet person that gave it to me.
5037599	5041282	I'm not saying anything negative about the game, but seriously, it was like getting a fruitcake for Christmas, okay?
5043745	5046847	You know Grandma loves you, but you got a damn fruitcake.
5048686	5051048	Yeah, well, Clubhouse Games is really cool.
5051108	5059173	What's really awesome about it is, with the Wi-Fi mode, you can play all of the multiplayer games online, which is like about 36, I think, when I come back to it.
5060093	5061074	Now, see, that's cool to me.
5061994	5066117	Yeah, and it's great because I'm a casual gamer as well as a hardcore gamer.
5066137	5067858	I love playing, like, Checkers, Chess, whatever.
5068298	5073802	So this is fun for me because I can play with my friends all around the world, and at the same time, it's games I know how to play.
5074929	5075169	Cool.
5075549	5080172	Now, what other kind of like features does this have kind of souped up with the games?
5080332	5085936	You know, there's like 30 some odd games, which I suppose is a big selling point, but what are some other features that might sell this game to people?
5087197	5093160	The fact that it's under the Touch Generations label, which is Nintendo's label for games anyone can pick up and play.
5094741	5098644	So you could... Sorry, lost in thought there.
5099424	5102686	You could pick up anything on this and immediately want to play it.
5103727	5103827	Um...
5104847	5106468	and from what I hear, it might be affordable.
5106508	5109830	I hear it might retail at the very most expensive $29.99.
5110871	5111712	Hmm, interesting.
5112312	5113653	Loki, do you know how much that's retailing for?
5114073	5114794	What thing?
5114954	5115434	Clubhouse games?
5115454	5116335	Do you know how much that's going for?
5116775	5119597	I want to say $19.99 or something.
5119817	5120398	Oh, okay.
5120538	5121778	That's a really good deal if that's true.
5122499	5123900	I can't remember off the top of my head.
5124600	5125901	If you give me a second, I can check.
5126161	5127102	All right, well, you do that.
5127742	5129424	What else did you want to say, DMN, while he's checking?
5129444	5132265	Well, now hearing about that whole Wii region lock...
5133522	5140286	It could be very possible that sometime down the road Nintendo could release a firmware update to eliminate that issue.
5141727	5142567	Why would they do that?
5143508	5143988	I don't know.
5144909	5151853	Perhaps maybe Nintendo will realize the error of their ways sometime down the road and be like, oh, hey, these people want to play our Japanese titles.
5152193	5157416	They can't ignore the fact that Oh and Don was one of the most imported games of 2006.
5157496	5157636	True.
5161024	5164386	and they said, okay, fine, we're going to give you Elite Beat Agents.
5165107	5169870	But if there's an Owen Don game coming out for the Wii, I want it.
5170530	5175974	And I don't want to have to buy another Wii or crack my Wii open to play it on my American console.
5176014	5180377	I totally understand what you're saying because it's as cool as Elite Beat Agents might be, it's not Owen Don.
5180477	5184740	It's not the same song list which in a music game is everything.
5185240	5185500	Oh, yeah.
5186361	5186521	So...
5187563	5192386	And that's what DarkTetsuya agrees in chat right there, but Elite Beat Agents is an entirely different game.
5193327	5194348	Alright, did you find the answer, Loki?
5196109	5196649	Yes, I did.
5197270	5197470	What?
5198110	5197470	$29.99.
5198451	5198571	Ah.
5199291	5199752	Blast.
5200192	5202634	That's alright, $29 is not a bad price, really, for that many games.
5203454	5206416	But I mean, they're not all like shitty clones of each other, right?
5206436	5208458	Like, they're all like uniquely different, pretty cool games?
5209018	5210919	Yeah, they're all uniquely different, and... That's cool.
5211360	5215523	I've already played a couple games of Wi-Fi, there is nothing like a good Wi-Fi game of BS.
5215903	5216103	Mm-hmm.
5217183	5219504	and definitely nothing like a good Wi-Fi game of Speed.
5220224	5223245	I'm totally going to be playing some of our chatters in Speed.
5223586	5224646	I'll buy this game just for that.
5225126	5226727	You could have just released Speed and I'd buy that.
5226747	5227287	That's a great game.
5228468	5234190	Alright, well I'll be picking up the game and we'll post on the forums and get an OLR get-together on the Clubhouse Games at some point.
5234710	5235730	Alright, cool.
5236030	5237291	DMN, thanks so much for calling in.
5237311	5237871	We appreciate it.
5238651	5239472	Have a wonderful week.
5239532	5239672	Bye-bye.
5239692	5242513	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skyflying tonight.
5242553	5243653	Thank you guys so much for calling in.
5243693	5244974	Sorry to those folks who didn't get through.
5245765	5246546	Try again next time.
5246927	5248350	Any last minute stories you want to share, Loki?
5248450	5248971	Of course I do.
5249151	5249832	I know, you always do.
5250654	5252718	Anyways, some wonderful stuff.
5253582	5262025	Okay, one thing about the Wii, since we were just talking about it, the Miis that you create, actually, they're going to be popping up in different things.
5262105	5268827	For example, in games, you might see the other Miis that you've created in the audience, or in the stands for certain games.
5269428	5275830	Also, they will be possibly migrating to other Wii systems, kind of like Animal Crossing, so that's kind of neat.
5276170	5278050	Oh, that's kind of neat, yeah.
5278091	5282372	So it's not just your face in Wii Sports as the tennis wielder, you might just, you might start
5283078	5286559	infecting other consoles.
5286599	5287259	That's pretty cool.
5288160	5295362	Some other cool stuff, Rainbow Six Vegas is going to be seeing a demo on Xbox Live on October 23rd.
5295622	5298263	That game looked pretty amazing, so worth checking out.
5299563	5305185	As we mentioned before with GT, that it was going to have a steering wheel attachment for the Wii.
5305665	5312807	Monster 4x4 World Circuit, another Ubisoft racing game, will also have that same steering wheel attachment as well for the Wii.
5313311	5313671	Earthworm Jim
5339039	5345920	And then there was a survey that went out for Guitar Hero that mentioned two games that are possibly in the works.
5346200	5348141	Keyboard Hero and Drummer Hero.
5349041	5352782	In no way, I'm sure, ripping off any Konami franchises with those.
5353822	5355442	But interesting nonetheless.
5357143	5359643	Oh yeah, I heard about that survey that went out.
5359723	5360603	I don't know though.
5361383	5364224	I think people might be reading too much into that whole thing.
5364604	5364764	Yeah.
5365790	5377797	There was also a really cool product that was released called Connect360 that indexes your iTunes and iPhoto libraries to stream them to the 360, which is interesting.
5377857	5386162	If you want to check that out, it's www.nullriver.com slash index slash products slash connect360.
5386702	5387903	So go check that out.
5388618	5392399	and then some more adult content that is available out there.
5393419	5399081	For Dead or Alive Extreme 2, you will be getting changing sequences.
5399901	5401202	That's right, the girls will change.
5401222	5402502	Like in Final Fantasy X-2?
5402542	5404442	The girls will change.
5404963	5405743	Actually, yes.
5406423	5407983	I knew it.
5408003	5415866	Yeah, it's not like... It says it will be anime-inspired, resembling a transformation sequence you'd find in something like Sailor Moon.
5416506	5416786	Curious.
5417267	5417727	Horrors of Warcraft 7.95
5441617	5443177	And it's real people.
5443217	5444958	This isn't Machima or anything like that.
5445018	5451319	But they actually also have a MySpace community if you want to join that, which is MySpace.com slash Hordes of Warcraft.
5452099	5455960	I should also mention Orange Lounge Radio has a MySpace community that's more worth your time.
5456040	5457541	MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5457561	5460241	But they have some chick that looks like she has elf ears.
5460601	5461701	So that's kind of interesting.
5462222	5463862	Get your elf porn going on there.
5464822	5465102	Wow.
5465402	5465762	That's it.
5466082	5466302	All right.
5466543	5468543	I have received a hot tip.
5468891	5478094	from a trusted source that WarioWare for the Wii is going to be bumped up to a launch title and you will be seeing that very soon.
5478394	5482036	Well, good, because I have that pre-ordered and it was only slated for January.
5482676	5486237	Well, it looks like you may actually get your WarioWare on in November.
5486597	5487018	Excellent.
5487058	5489579	So take that as you will.
5490659	5493340	I want to see Wii Play come out as a launch title too.
5494048	5501370	DarkSakura will be back next week to keep us in line and to read the emails and give you her website of the week, of which there is none this week because she's not here.
5521127	5528930	and next week as well we'll have more you guys in our chat room and on the Skype line and more news and hopefully some interviews.
5529011	5535834	We are trying to get some interviews lined up for the rest of the month on through the year and thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio.
5535954	5536514	We appreciate it.
5536774	5538195	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5538615	5539855	Well, Loki, your final thought?
5540396	5543717	My final thought is I have two episodes of my new show done already.
5544617	5545278	Both an hour long.
5545438	5545838	Excellent.
5545958	5549880	And you'll be, yes, Orange Launch Radio will be participating in November sweeps this year.
5549900	5550540	That's all I can say.
5551983	5557647	And my final thought will be, well, on behalf of Jamie not being here, I will say reject false icons.
5558128	5563812	And my other final thought would be how in the hell did six bottles of Aquafina end up over on Extra First's desk?
5563852	5564593	That's kind of scary.
5565093	5566014	They're all like half empty.
5566614	5568776	Actually, quite a bit of them are mostly full.
5568836	5569296	What the hell?
5569456	5570837	What the hell is wrong with this picture?
5570857	5571438	Such a waster.
5571938	5572659	Waster of water.
5572819	5576482	All those countries out there that are like, you know, dehydrated.
5576842	5577122	All right.
5577588	5579308	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us.
5579328	5579969	We appreciate it.
5579989	5580689	Have a great week.
5580729	5582389	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
