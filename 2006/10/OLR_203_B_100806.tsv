0	29760	If this is your first time tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, remember, or hear for the first
29760	32980	time that our show is released in two parts every week.
32980	36520	We tape live on Sunday nights and then split it up and release it to our podcast feed twice
36520	37520	a week.
37520	40560	So if you want to hear all the news we talked about in Part A, you've got to go download
40560	43240	Part A. But now it's time for Part B, isn't it, Loki?
43240	45040	Yes, it is.
45040	51720	And as we mentioned in Part A, Final Fantasy XII has been pirated to the internet.
51720	56160	Not too surprising, games have been pirated before, but it's 30 days before the game has
56160	58760	set the release in the United States.
58760	63000	And that's pretty interesting, that it's pirated.
63000	68980	So anyways, the ISO's leaked to torrent sites and various news group sites, none of which
68980	81440	I'm a member of, and it's apparently legitimate from the people that have it, not me.
81440	88000	It's interesting, so if you should spend your money on the actual game, don't steal because
88000	89000	pirating's bad.
89000	92840	I'll review it next week.
92840	97960	Now wait, what I'm curious about is, you know, sometimes when albums get leaked early, like,
97960	101400	I don't know, like didn't the Eminem, his last album, get released early?
101400	105560	And so they had to actually bump up the street date of the CD.
105560	107040	Do you think that might happen with this game?
107040	108040	No.
108040	110940	I mean, if the game's already done and in the can, what are we waiting for?
110940	111940	Let's play it!
111940	113660	It's a review copy.
113660	115520	That's what got leaked, is a review copy.
115520	116520	Ouch.
116520	117920	Anyone else that's been leaked to the internet?
117920	118920	What's that?
118920	119920	In the Groove 2 beta.
119920	120920	Really?
120920	121920	Yeah.
121920	122920	Hm.
122920	127240	It's funny how you find all these things out on torrent sites and other places.
127240	130200	Guys need to, the gaming companies need to keep a lock down on that stuff.
130200	134560	They do, and you know what, there's no one to blame, no one to blame but themselves,
134560	137380	because these are their copies, they get leaked out, so.
137380	138480	What could they do to stop this?
138480	140760	Put serial numbers on them somehow, or what?
140760	145840	They could make them so they're only able to play on dev kits, and hope that the reviewers
145840	146840	have dev kits.
146840	151080	Because I mean, honestly, are you really going to have to fish for good reviews for Final
151080	152080	Fantasy XII?
152080	153640	I mean, come on.
153640	159720	So you could do that, watermark them, so you know, each individual copy, although I know
159720	163800	it's going to be pretty difficult, each individual copy is watermarked so that you can check
163800	170480	a certain, you know, byte signature or whatever and see, oh, Bill over at such and such gaming
170480	173240	site leaked that out, I'm going to kill him!
173240	176200	I'm going to sue him for $11 billion dollars.
176200	184320	Exactly, so my take on this, you know, I don't know, I think, great, you get to play it three
184320	185320	days early.
185320	190320	Well, I think they should just release the damn game now, or don't put out your copy
190320	191320	so far in advance.
191320	194160	I guess maybe with so much to play through in Final Fantasy XII, that's why they did
194160	195160	it, but.
195160	196160	I guess.
196160	197160	I don't know.
197160	200120	And now you know all those marketing dollars that are getting pushed for Halloween, I don't
200120	201120	know.
201120	203640	But just again, you know, it's publicity for them.
203640	205600	The game will sell anyway.
205600	206600	You know, either way.
206600	211800	All right, well, we have another story here, and this is running on a site called qj.net,
211800	215920	and they ran a story this week that says, the ESRB don't play games!
215920	220060	And it goes like this, Aaron Ruby, the underground gaming culture spokesperson has a score to
220060	222060	settle with the ESRB.
222060	226140	The ESRB has been independently applying and enforcing ratings and guidelines and online
226140	228180	privacy since 1994.
228180	232220	The writer stated in his opinion column that the system applied to rating games should
232220	236480	be different from those currently applied to TV and movies, which I disagree with.
236480	241960	I think if you want parents to know what the ratings are clear as day, make them the same
241960	242960	as movies.
242960	244760	Anyway, well, oh well.
244760	246920	So anyway, how do they give out ratings anyway?
246920	249080	Well, they read and watch.
249080	252000	What happens is the game developers fill out a questionnaire on what the game's about,
252000	256320	and the game developers submit it with footage of the most extreme scenes from the game.
256320	260620	There are three trained raiders, not expert game players, if you check out the website
260620	264040	you'll see this is true, from the board, and then they hand out the rating based on what
264040	267400	they read on the form and see on the videos.
267400	271280	So according to the writer, quote, I find it alarming that the ESRB does not bother
271280	275600	to base its ratings on the entire experience of playing a game, instead relying far too
275600	277760	much on submitted clips.
277760	281360	Which is interesting because that doesn't surprise me because I remember, and I'm not
281360	286120	going to say who this was, but I was at a conference, or I should say media show once,
286120	294600	and I overheard a developer saying about a game that featured a lot of cleavage in it,
294600	299600	and a lot of female stuff in it, yeah, we barely got this one by the ESRB, we showed
299600	304360	them this and this and this clip, and I was like, that seems a little bit, and now it
304360	308080	kind of adds up because I never really bothered to read up on how ESRB was reviewing games,
308080	311440	shame on me, but now this kind of adds up for me as I'm kind of like, oh, they were
311440	315760	just sending clips of maybe the little bit less scandalous stuff.
315760	320000	But there's huge fines for lying and stuff, as the makers of Grand Theft Auto are finding
320000	323800	out, although I still to this day say they weren't lying, they were just careless and
323800	326440	thinking they took out a portion of the game that they didn't.
326440	330680	And it's gotten so ridiculous now where they're, you know, rating content that doesn't exist
330680	335240	in the game, you know, like Oblivion, you know, where they're rating it M because, yeah,
335240	340440	underneath the virtual clothes there's virtual nipples, so, I don't know, I think it's kind
340440	345600	of, interesting, but, alright.
345600	352280	But some other interesting stuff, speaking of virtual nipples, Playboy, you know, they've
352280	359080	been doing this thing for the last couple years now, releasing the Women of Video Games
359080	366640	spread in their magazine, yes, virtual naked women to ogle over, and both Fleshbot and
366640	371000	Kotaku have actually been running a preview picture of it, and we've got a list of the
371000	375760	people that are going to be featured in there, as well as, well, let's see, such wonderful
375760	385840	people, Sarah Morrison from Tabula Rasa, two of the women from the Scarface game, and we've
385840	394760	got two women from God of War 2, and Alicia Claus from Bullet Witch, Dr. Yasmin Lin from
394760	403560	Time Shift, and Erika from Splinter Cell Double Agent, a bunch of babes I've never heard of,
403560	409760	yeah, a bunch of games that aren't out yet, too, I see, so, very interesting, and that's
409760	412000	supposed to be coming out, I guess, later this year.
412000	413000	Did you look at the spread?
413000	414000	Yes, I did.
414000	415000	Nice boobies?
415000	420100	Virtual boobies, the one chick I thought, you know, when I first looked at it, I'm like,
420100	425160	why are they putting Blood Ring in it again, because I don't play a lot of PC games, so,
425160	429840	I don't know, it, I guess if you're into that stuff, I don't know, I'd put this up as a
429840	430840	pokeball.
430840	431840	If you're into boobs?
431840	437440	Well, if you're into this, like, you know, virtual, aren't they all fake boobs in Playboy?
437440	441720	I mean, seriously, they're all airbrushed and everything, I mean, what's the difference?
441720	442720	Virtual boobs or airbrushed boobs?
442720	445600	You know what, these are probably more real than some of the pictures that are in there,
445600	452500	so, I don't know, I guess that's cool, I don't know, very early pictures still, though, it's
452500	459200	going to be a, they're going to have a two-page fold-out in the final version, and six pages
459200	462000	of gaming content.
462000	463800	How many pages of boobies?
463800	464800	Lots of boobies.
464800	465800	All right.
465800	468340	I don't know, Playboy is a lot of, a lot of ads, and there's, like, not that many boobies
468340	469340	in that magazine anymore.
469340	475420	Will you be picking up this copy of Playboy for the articles, or for the research material?
475420	478600	I did last year, I think.
478600	480140	Your wife probably took it from you.
480140	482980	I think she did.
482980	487840	For those of you that haven't met Logie's wife, she's hilarious, that's all I can say.
487840	488840	She's had cameos on Instagram.
488840	491320	There was something else I was going to mention, because this was also on Fleshbot linked to
491320	492320	the same story.
492320	493320	Oh, dear.
493320	501120	There is a NerdCorps 2007 calendar out starring Sherry Roberts, and there's one picture-
501120	504280	Oh my God, my sister!
504280	506000	That joke, sorry.
506000	509960	Anyways, there's one picture, though, that I thought was funny, and I showed Rob this
509960	515920	earlier, how they have her standing there naked with a power glove on, touching her
515920	518240	ass, and I thought that was funny.
518240	523000	So yeah, very interesting.
523000	525280	I don't know, there's not much more I can really say about that.
525280	531920	If you want to purchase the calendar, though, you can get it at totallynerdcorps.com, and
531920	534960	I believe it's like 20 bucks.
534960	537320	I don't know, I guess it's worth your dollars.
537320	542480	I'm sorry, but I don't know, that's kind of hot.
542480	547360	If maybe chicks wearing gaming accessories aren't your thing, do you think that's hot?
547360	548360	I guess it could be, yeah.
548360	549360	All right.
549360	550360	You think your wife will think it's hot?
550360	555480	She probably should think it's stupid, but anyways, it says it's a limited edition.
555480	563120	They're going to have 2,500 copies, they're $25 each, features 12 months of girls with
563120	566640	a complete daily calendar grid and all that stuff.
566640	575840	They're pretty big, and yeah, lots of interesting pictures there.
575840	578200	I like the cover, though, the power glove.
578200	582400	What's up with this recent increase in erotic photography with gaming equipment?
582400	585420	Because I've seen this on the internet, and I was on some gay site, I don't remember which
585420	589280	one it was, but it was a gay gamer site, not gay porn.
589280	592640	I wouldn't do that, I'm a nice guy.
592640	598260	There was a gay gamer site that had pictures of guys covered in cartridges and nothing
598260	599260	but cartridges.
599260	601880	It kind of reminds me of this whole thing.
601880	607040	The Nerdcore calendar also has, other than your typical holidays, it has nerd holidays
607040	608040	in there.
608040	614080	Such, for example, the International San Diego Comic Con, Anime Expo, Game Developers Conference,
614080	619520	Talk Like a Pirate Day, Tokyo Game Show, The Transformers the Movie, Opening Day, and other
619520	622320	flagship nerd videos.
622320	633360	TotallyNerdcore.com is where you can purchase this calendar.
633360	636320	I got to say, damn it, we need to get them on the show and get one of these models on
636320	637320	the show.
637320	638320	Wouldn't that be awesome?
638320	646080	Wait until we all have any model on this show.
646080	652080	I don't know what else to say, so let's move on from boobies to violence.
652080	654440	All the great games have either boobies or violence in them.
654440	658680	Violence, violence, violence, this story is coming from GamePolitics.com, our friends
658680	659680	over there.
659680	663560	That has to do with the question and answer session with the Dean of the School of Social
663560	666320	Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.
666320	668840	His name is Richard J. Gelles.
668840	669840	And there was this interesting quote.
669840	673900	The question was, excuse me, sir, but what is your opinion on video games and the lack
673900	677640	of parenting to control the ever-increasing teen violence?
677640	682560	Answer, video games play almost no important role in teen violence.
682560	687600	Teens with a predisposition to being violent may be drawn to violent video games, but overall
687600	692520	other factors besides television, music, or video games are more important risk factors
692520	693520	for teen violence.
693520	699440	Again, that quote from Richard Gelles, the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice
699440	702600	at the University of Pennsylvania, also the Director of Center for Research on Youth and
702600	703680	Social Policy.
703680	706280	So this guy does know what he's talking about, I guess.
706280	709600	It makes him pretty smart now, doesn't it?
709600	714480	Speaking of doctors and stuff, we've got one doctor who is actually defected to the PSP
714480	717840	and that would be Dr. Kawawashima.
717840	719960	You might know him from Brain Age.
719960	725600	Well anyways, he's coming to a brand new game being put out called Mind Quiz coming out
725600	731360	in November and it's actually going to be pretty much the same kind of stuff.
731360	734400	They've got your Brain Age score and stuff like that.
734400	739680	So imagine Brain Age minus a touch screen and on your PSP.
739680	745920	That's kind of big news because this guy, he was doing the DS stuff and those games
745920	750720	are huge in Japan and now he's kind of defected in a way to the PSP.
750720	754920	I don't think Nintendo is going to slow down their big brain series any time soon, but
754920	755920	kind of interesting.
755920	758440	I wonder what possessed him to do that.
758440	760920	Well, I mean, money?
760920	761920	Maybe.
761920	763800	There's more brain training games coming out.
763800	770840	I know, I think Majesco has two coming out in November.
770840	772840	Like Brain Wave, I think it was called.
772840	777200	Now it's just going to be like all those crappy Nintendogs knockoffs we got a while
777200	778200	back.
778200	781520	Oh God, November is the month for Nintendogs knockoffs.
781520	785440	They've got the whole dogs, cats, hamster life, horses.
785440	790080	Uh oh, I shudder to think what might be possible in a hamster life.
790080	794880	Anyway, let's move on and get some feedback from you guys, the listeners.
794880	799440	Every week we invite your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and DarkSakura is
799440	803080	typically here to read through the email, but as you know, she's not here tonight, so
803080	816840	I'm going to instead borrow her asbestos suit and put on the gloves and dig into our Mailbag.
816840	819920	First thing I want to say is we got a lot of emails this week, a lot of emails, and
819920	824200	we love reading your emails, but unfortunately we just don't have the time to read them all
824200	825200	on air.
825200	829080	I'm going to read five of them tonight, which is a lot, but please keep them coming in and
829080	833040	we try to respond to as many as we can get and we love reading your guys' opinions, so
833040	835560	please don't stop just because we don't read your emails.
835560	836560	Sorry.
836560	839640	Alright, so this first email comes to us from Deepman.
839640	844200	Deepman writes, Hey guys, just thinking about the new next gen consoles and had these thoughts.
844200	845200	1.
845200	847120	The cost of the Wii at $249.
847120	850640	I think they chose to set it at this price not to make money, even though it is selling
850640	854000	it more than it's worth, but for the simple reason that Nintendo doesn't want you to get
854000	855360	any other console.
855360	860440	Just think for a second, with a $150-$200 console, an Xbox 360 sounds mighty enticing
860440	866400	to go with it, but a $250 console plus games, suddenly that extra 360 doesn't look as good.
866400	870100	To back this up, I remember hearing a quote posted on Kotaku by Reggie that said something
870100	874960	along the lines of, and I'm paraphrasing here, quote, I've heard of the Wii 60, but our users
874960	877720	buy our consoles because they want a different experience.
877720	879640	If they want something else, they can get a DS.
879640	883080	Again, I'm paraphrasing, but it sounds like Nintendo is being smart with the pricing,
883080	884160	if only to cut out the competition.
884160	885960	What do you think of that?
885960	886960	I don't know.
886960	889760	That sounds pretty accurate.
889760	895120	It's an interesting theory, but I don't think that was a factor in the price point they
895120	900840	chose was because it makes the 360 sound less appealing.
900840	901840	I don't know.
901840	906000	I think if they could make it cheaper, I think in the long run it's which system costs which.
906000	911040	I think your average family is only going to get one console unless they have some hardcore
911040	913960	gamers in the house, if even that.
913960	917840	It's a good theory, and it may be right, but I just kind of think there's a lot of other
917840	919880	factors that come into play.
919880	921760	Dick Mann also writes this, too.
921760	925720	Region-free PlayStation 3, not as elaborate as the last theory, but what if the reason
925720	930640	Sony is making the console region-free is quite simply to combat mod chippers?
930640	935140	A strong case, and the one most used in courts, especially in Australia so far, is that people
935140	937600	mod their systems to play import games.
937600	941440	What if this is simply a way to nip the next-gen mod chippers in the bud before they start?
941440	944440	What do you think of that, Loki?
944440	945440	Could be.
945440	951880	I think, mainly, you know the whole HDMI being added to all the different systems and stuff?
951880	956440	I think that kind of ties in with it, because now they can do the digital flag on all the
956440	959520	movies, and they might be able to do that with all the games now, too, if they have
959520	960760	HDMI on there.
960760	965000	But I guess since they do give the option not to use the HDMI, that might not be the
965000	970480	case, but yeah, region-free, I mean, I don't see why they don't, I mean, when you think
970480	973120	about it, because a lot of games, I mean, if you're going to import them, that's more
973120	977760	sales for them anyways, so I don't see what the big difference is, I mean, granted you
977760	982960	get stuff early, but it's not going to be, you know, it's only, it's not going to be
982960	986560	translated for over here, unless it already comes in both languages anyways, which, why
986560	988680	wouldn't you release them in both territories?
988680	992640	Alright, there's still more email here from Deep Man, that's all I've got for now, but
992640	996200	I want to let you guys know that my girlfriend and I went to see Play, the video game symphony,
996200	998520	last weekend in Toronto, and it was amazing.
998520	1003200	We met Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, the guy who did the music for Shenmue and the Daytona theme,
1003200	1006880	which he performed a new piano version live, and the guys who did the music for Prey and
1006880	1007880	Oblivion.
1007880	1012200	All I have to say is that if this comes to a town near you, guys, make sure to check
1012200	1015280	them out, perhaps the most amazing show I've ever seen.
1015280	1018560	And Sky, you should definitely move up to Canada, I did seven months ago and haven't
1018560	1022020	been happier, keep up the good work, still listening, Deep Man.
1022020	1023020	Thank you very much.
1023020	1028480	As far as Canada goes, you know, it's a nice thought, I'd love to maybe retire up there,
1028480	1031360	but just for right now, there's too much going on for me here in the States.
1031360	1036400	But I definitely will be taking another vacation up there, probably next year, we'll see.
1036400	1041480	Our next email comes to us from Malice, the artist formerly known as Stupid Baka, or so
1041480	1045240	his signature says, Hello Orange Lounge, I'd just like to say before I say anything else
1045240	1046240	that I really love your show.
1046240	1050040	I used to be a live listener since the days of B3, that was the big DDR tournament we
1050040	1051320	did in San Francisco we covered.
1051320	1054280	I remember seeing you folks down at B3, which was definitely awesome.
1054280	1058480	I also remember meeting Sky before a Milpitas Golf Land DDR tournament also.
1058480	1060000	Those are all very good times, by the way.
1060000	1063240	Unfortunately I can no longer catch the live show, but I do make sure to download the podcast
1063240	1064240	off iTunes.
1064240	1066160	You folks still are awesome and I really like the show.
1066160	1069240	I love sitting in my room and doing my homework or talking to friends with the podcast in
1069240	1070240	the background.
1070240	1073420	I also like your guys' quirky attitudes and witty remarks from time to time, especially
1073420	1075600	those that belong to Dark Sakura and Sky.
1075600	1076600	You guys make my day.
1076600	1079400	In other words, Loki, sorry, you suck.
1079400	1080400	Just kidding.
1080400	1083160	No, thank you seriously for the words, I appreciate it.
1083160	1086640	I know this is a recurring theme of discussion on the podcast and I was just wondering what
1086640	1087640	you guys thought of this.
1087640	1091600	I am a member of my school's mock trial team and have been since last year.
1091600	1095860	This year's case is People vs. Campbell, in which a student that is being bullied allegedly
1095860	1098120	created a time bomb to blow up his school.
1098120	1102220	He is being charged with acts of terrorism, intent to murder, placing an offensive substance
1102220	1106480	in a public place, and possessing a violent video game.
1106480	1110920	All the mock trial cases have pre-trial arguments in which we argue to a judge about certain
1110920	1115140	aspects of the case before it occurs, specifically in regards to evidence, the Constitution's
1115140	1118140	Bill of Rights, and whether it shall be allowed during the case.
1118140	1121760	The defense in this pre-trial argument will argue that video games are protected speech
1121760	1126400	under the First Amendment, which is something I agree with, as do you guys, I assume.
1126400	1130080	This seems to be echoed, as all the cases that they have given us that are relevant
1130080	1132880	and have precedent are all in favor of the defense.
1132880	1136560	This is definitely a change, as most of the cases each year, especially in pre-trial,
1136560	1140540	are made so that they aren't one-sided and can be argued both ways, ensuring for an exciting
1140540	1144560	trial based on how good each side is, which is why I'll most likely be on the prosecution
1144560	1145560	this year.
1145560	1148480	I was just wondering what you guys have to say about this, as I know that you three are
1148480	1151000	very vocal and have a lot to say about this issue.
1151000	1152280	Have a nice three-day weekend.
1152280	1154160	Unfortunately, it's not three days for me.
1154160	1156160	I have to work tomorrow, even if it is Columbus Day.
1156160	1157160	Nor me.
1157160	1160640	Yeah, well, lucky you guys that get it off.
1160640	1166780	Anyway, I don't know much about the specific case that you're citing.
1166780	1171400	Just based off of other cases, I think you pretty much said what I feel.
1171400	1177320	I would agree with the fact that video games are a form of art, just like – and I'm
1177320	1183080	not talking about art as in a classic sculpture you might see, but it is a form of expression.
1183080	1187400	Expression is art, and it's no different than a movie or a CD.
1187400	1194960	I think, therefore, it should be viewed at very similarly by the public.
1194960	1199640	There are the people that criticize violent movies, and they probably do criticize violent
1199640	1200640	games.
1200640	1206340	But you can't say that a kid played a video game and that's what caused him to go crazy,
1206340	1209560	because what about the R-rated movies he might have seen?
1209560	1211940	Or what about the dirty music he might have been listening to?
1211940	1216320	But more importantly, what about the parents?
1216320	1217840	What about the home life?
1217840	1218840	Where was the love?
1218840	1219840	Where was the hug?
1219840	1221800	Where was the how was your day?
1221800	1227640	What's more important than the CDs, movies, or video games combined, in my opinion?
1227640	1228920	Loki anything you want to add to that?
1228920	1233560	No, it's basically just bad parenting.
1233560	1236600	And I'm looking at chat room to see what things they're talking about there.
1236600	1239360	Black Boy says, dirty music?
1239360	1246320	Like Christina Aguilera's last album, Going to Get Dirty.
1246320	1249520	Next email comes to us from Mr. Wonderful.
1249520	1251560	Hey guys and lady.
1251560	1252840	First off, thanks for putting on the show.
1252840	1255760	I emailed Skye earlier, but figured that I should be thanking you all.
1255760	1259360	I recently graduated college and got a great job right after graduation.
1259360	1262120	It's really awesome, but it doesn't leave me a lot of time to sit around with my friends
1262120	1263120	and just geek out.
1263120	1265880	I've got an hour commute though, and your show really hits the spot.
1265880	1268960	I still have to put on my suit and tie every day, but it's great to listen to you guys
1268960	1270080	on the way to work.
1270080	1273560	It's like hanging out with some very well-informed friends and talking about games.
1273560	1274560	So thanks again.
1274560	1275560	You guys rock.
1275560	1277120	And Dark Sakura, don't let any haters get you down.
1277120	1280520	Even a relative noob to the show like myself can tell you know what you're talking about.
1280520	1284440	For Christ's sake, you mentioned the turbo duo and radiant silver gun in the same breath.
1284440	1287880	If treasure shooters aren't hardcore anymore, then nothing is.
1287880	1291320	I've got to agree though that you really should play Pinball Quest.
1291320	1293680	Even though she's not here tonight, I'll make sure she sees that part of the email.
1293680	1297280	I'm sure she will appreciate that, and I will make her play Pinball Quest.
1297280	1300280	Anyway, forgive me if these questions have been asked, but I'm still making my way through
1300280	1301280	the backlog.
1301280	1302600	On to a few quick questions.
1302600	1306760	First off, have you guys had the power to resurrect one franchise for a well-done Wii
1306760	1311200	make, bringing back an old game, giving it a sequel with quality Wii functionality?
1311200	1312600	What would you go for?
1312600	1316440	Maybe it's just the recent re-release on GBA Talking, but I've got to think a Wii Bionic
1316440	1319480	Commando would do the job pretty nicely.
1319480	1320480	Thoughts?
1320480	1323440	If it's 3D, maybe.
1323440	1325800	What game would you like to see Wii made?
1325800	1332080	Well, I know Kid Icarus is the obvious answer that most fanboys I'm sure would be foaming
1332080	1334120	at the mouth for, and that would definitely be my number one answer.
1334120	1339080	But as far as a GameCube game that I'd like to see on the Wii, I want to see F-Zero have
1339080	1340080	another shot.
1340080	1345040	And I'm sure there will be some type of F-Zero on the Wii, but I really enjoyed the GameCube
1345040	1350360	one, and I think it was a little bit underrated in part because the arcade version had one
1350360	1354400	key flaw, and that was the fact that there was really only the one model, which was very
1354400	1361200	expensive because the car moved around a lot, and the fact there was only six tracks in
1361200	1363900	the arcade, and you can unlock them all in the home version.
1363900	1368560	I think there was a lot to still be discovered with that concept that I think unfortunately
1368560	1370880	in the execution kind of fell apart.
1370880	1374920	But you know, the whole driving with the Wii stick might be kind of interesting in F-Zero
1374920	1375920	or something.
1375920	1380640	At least even with the slightly souped-up graphics and sound, I would like to see that
1380640	1385040	and the sound coming out of the controller, I'm really looking forward to a new F-Zero
1385040	1386040	game.
1386040	1387040	And online, please.
1387040	1388040	Anything?
1388040	1390040	Loki, you can think of?
1390040	1391960	It's kind of hard.
1391960	1395280	I don't really know.
1395280	1396280	What could we do?
1396280	1400600	That would be really awesome.
1400600	1402320	Let's see.
1402320	1405560	Drunami says Capcom seriously needs to put Okami on the Wii.
1405560	1407840	Yeah, that's not a Wii make-up.
1407840	1409480	DMN says Kirby's Dream Force.
1409480	1412480	That might be kind of fun, he could actually swing the ball.
1412480	1415520	That was a fun game on Super Nintendo.
1415520	1424000	I don't know, I'd say just remake, like make a good, even like a Castlevania would
1424000	1428440	be kind of cool, a good Castlevania for 3D and make it like a first person shooter would
1428440	1429440	be kind of neat.
1429440	1430440	Really?
1430440	1431440	I want to see him do the 2D.
1431440	1432440	I got excited by the 2D news last week.
1432440	1439280	Well, 2D, you can have a 2D Castlevania too, I mean, just maybe Blaster Master maybe?
1439280	1440280	Now that's hot.
1440280	1442240	Alright, let's go to the next email.
1442240	1445920	Hey guys, it's Neodude, belated congrats on 200 and all that.
1445920	1449320	I just wanted to talk about the Sonic demo on 360 for a moment and why it sucked.
1449320	1451600	Oh my god, I played that actually now.
1451600	1453200	What'd you think?
1453200	1454200	It sucked.
1454200	1456440	It was just like horrible controls.
1456440	1460720	I couldn't even make it over the first jump because it was just veering off to the side
1460720	1463320	when I had hit tap the button to the side.
1463320	1465120	The email continues for Neodude here.
1465120	1467080	The big thing was the camera sucked.
1467080	1470480	Sonic has always relied on good camera control and it's not here.
1470480	1474120	Plus the demo gave Sonic everything he had at the end of Sonic Adventure 2, including
1474120	1478400	the bounce bracelet, which leads to many unexpected deaths, especially when you're trying to light
1478400	1479640	dash in the air.
1479640	1483640	If they include a window that tells you what the X button does at any time and fix the
1483640	1487440	camera and maybe take out the bounce bracelet, everything else should be alright.
1487440	1488440	Catch you next episode.
1488440	1490800	Well, I hope they changed something.
1490800	1494400	I know they've been getting negative feedback around the web and who knows, it may result
1494400	1497720	in a delay of the game, I don't know, but it would be nice to see them go back and change
1497720	1498720	things.
1498720	1499720	We'll see.
1499720	1503960	What they should do is have an option when you're running straight to be able to strafe
1503960	1504960	a little bit.
1504960	1506400	They need a strafe button in it.
1506400	1513200	So when I'm running straight ahead, when I try to be a little off on the rings there,
1513200	1515680	I'm not going to all of a sudden veer off to the side.
1515680	1517840	That's what they need to fix.
1517840	1522800	This last email tonight comes to us from Lazer123454321.
1522800	1525960	And he writes this, Hi Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura.
1525960	1529480	I first wanted to thank you for giving the Bimani community its first podcast as well
1529480	1531040	as your general game coverage.
1531040	1532040	Read.
1532040	1533040	You rock.
1533040	1535920	I like all the politeness, like the fluffing of the egos in the first paragraph of all
1535920	1536920	our letters tonight.
1536920	1540360	No, seriously, we love the fact that you guys are so receptive to it.
1540360	1541360	It's awesome.
1541360	1545160	Second, I would like to get your in-depth view of the new DDR Supernova for PlayStation
1545160	1546160	2.
1546160	1549480	Just to tell about some of the experiences I've had, the new Stellar Master Mode far
1549480	1554080	outshines the Dance Master Mode of DDR EX and EX2, as the majority of the unlocks can be
1554080	1558120	done just by completing the first few trials in each Stellar joint and then facing the
1558120	1559120	showdown.
1559120	1561680	I personally play Controller Controller Revolution.
1561680	1563960	We call it Button Button Revolution, but that's fine.
1563960	1568760	So I like to face the Diamond EX Showdown or EX Showdown in each joint.
1568760	1571000	Anything you want to say additional about DDR Supernova, Loki?
1571000	1573120	I haven't played it yet.
1573120	1575560	I did play it a little bit.
1575560	1576560	And I agree.
1576560	1580440	I gave my fuller review on last week's program, so you can go back and download that in Part
1580440	1584960	A. But I definitely think it's a solid entry into the series.
1584960	1588080	And we'll give you lots of new songs.
1588080	1591920	I like the song list, and I do agree that Stellar Master Mode is an improvement on the
1591920	1592920	mode they had last year.
1592920	1596200	But I didn't despise the mode they had last year so much.
1596200	1600360	I felt it's okay to have the really, really hard songs kind of tricky to unlock because
1600360	1601360	they're extra.
1601360	1602360	They're bonus.
1602360	1605000	They're supposed to take a lot of effort to unlock.
1605000	1607740	But I think they did do a little bit better this time.
1607740	1608740	Other questions.
1608740	1612680	One, what do you think about the song list as compared to the other US releases?
1612680	1615320	I think it's a pretty good song list.
1615320	1620160	I do too, but Max 2 was still my favorite overall, just as an old school DDR fan.
1620160	1623440	But I do think it was better than Extreme 1's song list.
1623440	1627400	Two, what are some downfalls with the game?
1627400	1631720	Link mode disappearing was an interesting thing that was a bit of a downfall of the
1631720	1634280	game, I think.
1634280	1635680	Other downfalls for the game.
1635680	1638320	Oh, the fact that they got rid of a lot of the videos.
1638320	1643420	I don't like the whole dancer in the custom-generated background or whatever.
1643420	1646400	One thing I liked about DDR was some of the art backgrounds they had, and I always kind
1646400	1650720	of looked forward to seeing some of the ones they came up with for new songs.
1650720	1651720	It's kind of not there in Supernova.
1651720	1658640	This is a stupid request, but the one I made before went on Extreme 2 is not being able
1658640	1665760	to put in edits for the IToy stuff.
1665760	1669080	You can't put in hand things on your edits.
1669080	1670400	That would have been cool if you could do that.
1670400	1677240	Granted, hardly anyone actually uses it, but how hard would it be to put that as an option
1677240	1678240	for your edits?
1678240	1679240	I don't understand.
1679240	1683480	Three, what do you think about Konami bringing back Battle Mode?
1683480	1686520	I think it should be more prevalent in their next release.
1686520	1690880	I think they should really explore what they can do with versus mode, because I used to
1690880	1695480	say this way back when the show was strictly about Bomani Games and we had the three-hour
1695480	1696480	show.
1696480	1698800	I think the future of DDR was in a versus mode.
1698800	1702960	I would like to see more competitive style play and options, so I think it's a good step
1702960	1708000	in the right direction, but I'd like to see that option more fully researched in the next
1708000	1710800	release of DDR and do more with it.
1710800	1711800	Just a thought.
1711800	1714440	Four, what is your opinion on the online controversy?
1714440	1718540	For those that don't know, the game features a few songs that are online only.
1718540	1723600	That is, you cannot play songs that are exclusive to online play in the free dance mode offline,
1723600	1726300	even after having played them in the online mode.
1726300	1730200	Some have speculated that when Konami shuts down Supernova online play like they did for
1730200	1732960	Extreme 2, that these songs will be lost.
1732960	1736480	Others believe that when this happens, Konami will reveal an unlocked code for the songs
1736480	1740740	for offline play.
1740740	1744160	I don't think it's the doom and gloom most people are shouting about.
1744160	1745880	It's something extra.
1745880	1748040	What if you have an Xbox that doesn't go online?
1748040	1750160	There's many great songs that you're missing out on.
1750160	1753960	Now, granted, I see the difference because you can download those songs and play them
1753960	1755800	offline whenever you want.
1755800	1761460	But I would speculate that if there's a Supernova 2 or whatever is next, which I would find
1761460	1764480	it hard to believe there's not going to be at least one more PlayStation 2 game next
1764480	1769940	year, I would bet almost anything you're going to see those five songs in the default song
1769940	1771920	list for next year's game.
1771920	1777900	So I don't know anything that's just speculation, but it would make sense.
1777900	1780740	And then people wouldn't complain about repeats so much because they didn't really have them
1780740	1781740	in the last game.
1781740	1787080	What if they're just going to be unlocked at a time unlock type of thing?
1787080	1791600	Like they're going to be unlocked on a certain date, say when the other games come out.
1791600	1792600	I don't think they are.
1792600	1795360	I seriously think they're ever going to be unlocked.
1795360	1798880	I think online only is online only, and I think that's it.
1798880	1801680	That's until someone puts out a code for it.
1801680	1802680	That's true.
1802680	1803680	Someone might hack a save.
1803680	1807400	And to be honest, the content is there, so...
1807400	1808400	True.
1808400	1809400	So who knows?
1809400	1810400	Why not?
1810400	1813600	And then lastly, and finally for those involved in the StepMania community, Loki might want
1813600	1814600	to read this.
1814600	1816760	There's a Supernova-like theme out already.
1816760	1818400	It's called New Nova.
1818400	1822480	It looks really good, but most of the features of Supernova cannot be replicated in StepMania
1822480	1823480	at this time.
1823480	1831560	Takuya's DDR Extreme, Daikatsu 88, Katsu Extreme, and K Eternal DDR Red, read K Eternal, have
1831560	1836920	expressed interest in doing a Supernova theme, and Takuya will start work as soon as he has
1836920	1838600	rips from the Supernova disc.
1838600	1842920	I believe K Eternal is waiting for StepMania 4.0's theming engine to be finalized before
1842920	1844360	he starts work.
1844360	1850040	It's not that hard to rip stuff off that disc, and to be honest, it's funny how I mentioned
1850040	1853600	In the Groove 2 beta had already been leaked.
1853600	1859360	They've already made tools to basically reskin it, re-put songs in it for your own stuff,
1859360	1861280	like they did with In the Groove 1.
1861280	1868200	So, you know, it's going to be possible pretty soon just to do all that stuff pretty easy.
1868200	1873160	I mean, hell, they've already automated the whole ripping of In the Groove stuff off of
1873160	1875200	the disc once the game comes out.
1875200	1878440	I have to be honest, I'm just not that big on playing DDR on my computer.
1878440	1880440	Well, that's the thing.
1880440	1884400	With the In the Groove rips that you can do in the editing, you can actually either, if
1884400	1888840	you have a modded PS2, you can dump it to a disc and actually play it on the Playstation
1888840	1893600	2, or if you have a hard drive like mine does, you can dump the ISO to the hard drive and
1893600	1898600	play it off of that, and you can actually play your DDR on the Playstation 2.
1898600	1902840	Alright, well that's going to do it for the mailbag this week, and lots of great emails
1902840	1903840	this week.
1903840	1904840	Again, sorry to those we didn't get to tonight.
1904840	1910160	If you want to send us some email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1910160	1912080	Let's go to the next story.
1912080	1913280	Loki, excellent.
1913280	1918920	Well, the big story this week is, well one of the big stories, Mark Raine is basically
1918920	1923800	saying that the second gen game Gears of War on the 360 looks better than the first gen
1923800	1929360	PS3 titles, and you know, he's sort of right on some of those, but I don't know, it's all
1929360	1930360	pinning.
1930360	1936920	Sony says their next generation starts when they say so, I say bullshit, and basically
1936920	1941400	stating that the next gen will start when that game comes out.
1941400	1945640	I don't know, whatever, big talk, but we'll see.
1945640	1950040	Sounds like people just kind of whipping it out back and forth, typical PR, trying to
1950040	1951600	slam the other guy type stuff.
1951600	1956320	Alright, well speaking of the Xbox 360, of course when Doom came out, a lot of people
1956320	1958300	were like, where's Duke Nukem?
1958300	1961040	If you're going to bring us Doom, you need to bring us Duke Nukem.
1961040	1967360	Well, there was an interesting post by a staff of 3D Realms, quote, you'd be surprised what
1967360	1968520	they've turned down.
1968520	1971840	Don't just assume MS will want it just because you like it and it's popular.
1971840	1976000	Hate to sound defeatist, but it's not as easy as send it to Microsoft and get it on there.
1976000	1979960	It's a rather complicated procedure and Microsoft is fairly picky about what goes on there.
1979960	1983240	Sorry to sound so defeatist, but individual users won't do much of anything.
1983240	1986120	Now if you could get something on the order of a million people to do the same thing,
1986120	1989360	that might be different, but talking to one person like that isn't going to do anything.
1989360	1992560	Besides, if you can think of it, they already have, I bet on it.
1992560	1995680	Plus, as I said above, we've already talked about it ourselves, I've talked about this
1995680	1999440	yesterday with George, he's all up for the idea, but we don't have the time to do the
1999440	2000440	port ourselves.
2000440	2005960	Plus, there's the issue of whether Microsoft would really want it.
2005960	2009200	Don't just assume they would, there's a big submissions procedure to go through.
2009200	2012960	Plus, their release schedule is booked solid for quite a while now, even if we delivered
2012960	2016080	it to them today, I would imagine it wouldn't come out for a while anyway.
2016080	2019120	Oh come on, they can release two games in one day?
2019120	2023380	I have a hard time their schedule is so booked solid when things keep getting pushed back
2023380	2027760	and we have to get things like the Project Gotham deck for Uno to hold us over.
2027760	2033000	I mean, if they're so booked, why don't they release two games in one day?
2033000	2035120	Is it going to kill the server that much?
2035120	2036120	I mean, come on.
2036120	2038360	Well, I think they're afraid that one game would outshine another.
2038360	2041560	That's why they don't release like 10 or 15 at a time, because they want all the games
2041560	2042560	to have a fair shot.
2042560	2043560	Does that make sense?
2043560	2045560	No, it doesn't make sense, that's stupid.
2045560	2051680	I mean, the game's going to be up there anyways, so, okay, say, Dig Dug and Duke Nukem get
2051680	2052680	released at the same time.
2052680	2056120	Grand Dig Dug's not going to sell as well, but you know what, people will buy it later
2056120	2057120	on.
2057120	2058120	Who cares?
2058120	2062880	Or put it up like a free game, like Totem Ball and Duke Nukem 3D.
2062880	2066800	There you go, you have your free game that doesn't matter how many copies you sell on
2066800	2071360	that or put out on that, and then you have Duke Nukem 3D.
2071360	2072920	I don't know, I don't see what the big deal is.
2072920	2075720	I think what the big deal is, they don't want to work on it because they're not fucking
2075720	2080620	done with Duke Nukem Forever yet, and to be honest, just put the damn thing out.
2080620	2085480	It's never going to be perfect, you're never going to finish it, the generation of hardwares
2085480	2089480	is going to get better and better each time you're about done.
2089480	2091160	It's never going to happen.
2091160	2097440	Anyways, some other interesting stuff though, like Duke Nukem 3D, you know, had a pretty
2097440	2098440	good multiplayer.
2098440	2102740	Well, another game that has really good multiplayer, Lost Planet, and we will be seeing a multiplayer
2102740	2108560	demo this winter, which is pretty cool, so, yeah, looking forward to that, probably in
2108560	2111400	November sometime, would be my guess.
2111400	2114800	You know, I wasn't that big on Lost Planet when I played it.
2114800	2117080	I don't know, I'm not sure what all the hype's about.
2117080	2121800	Maybe it's just not my kind of game, but maybe a multiplayer would change my mind, if I had
2121800	2122800	a lot of fun with that.
2122800	2123800	Yeah.
2123800	2124800	Are you more excited about this game?
2124800	2125800	Did you enjoy the first demo that came out?
2125800	2130600	I don't like the first demo, I'm not sure if I'd buy it though, right away, I mean,
2130600	2135200	I think about that time, I'm going to be busy with the Wii, so, you know, I'm not sure if
2135200	2137360	I really want to buy this game right away.
2137360	2142600	I mean, it was a cool game, I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks really good, just,
2142600	2147560	I don't know if it, I really don't need to be buying that many games now, so.
2147560	2148560	All right.
2148560	2155400	Well, let's do another story here, and this one is regarding Full Auto II, is going to
2155400	2160440	be releasing some PS3 online details.
2160440	2165280	Apparently, the developers behind Full Auto II actually released some of the details about
2165280	2171000	what online's going to be all about, and it was on this Radio PM podcast.
2171000	2175720	The Full Auto II producer, Mike Gallo from Sega of America, talked about what was going
2175720	2181200	on, and the OPM asked, so when you go into network play, you'll see sort of a browser,
2181200	2184400	and they say, when you first turn on the machine, it logs you in automatically.
2184400	2188520	I think you can change that in the settings, you have a user ID and an online profile that's
2188520	2192240	set up through the PlayStation, we don't have anything to do with that, that's all done
2192240	2193800	through the PlayStation network.
2193800	2197280	When you log in, and as long as you have an ID and you're an active online member, when
2197280	2200680	you go into the online modes, you get a menu option, you get to pick ranked or unranked
2200680	2205920	play, then you'll see what games are available and then jump into one of those, kind of interesting.
2205920	2210800	There's more information, as far as stat tracking, is it all within Full Auto, is that outside?
2210800	2214720	When you play ranked play, your stats, pretty basic set of stats, wins, losses, will get
2214720	2216320	uploaded to GameSpy.
2216320	2219600	You'll be able to see, I think we have it sortable by, it's worldwide and monthly or
2219600	2222260	all time, so you'll get to see who's ranked where.
2222260	2226060	You'll be able to access it from our website as well, so you can look at those stats independently
2226060	2227720	of the game.
2227720	2232120	Mr. Big on 360, did you guys think about throwing in that concept for PS3?
2232120	2234640	We actually do not have that in Full Auto 2.
2234640	2237600	It's a feature we had to regrettably not support.
2237600	2241760	A lot of it was just because of that moving target with the development timeline.
2241760	2245780	We had to make sure our online modes and network play was solid before we added some of that
2245780	2246780	other stuff.
2246780	2249760	Unfortunately, that was one of the things we had to drop.
2249760	2253500	Kind of interesting though, if that means that there's not really going to be achievements
2253500	2254500	like we know it on the 360.
2254500	2258280	It's just going to be on whatever games that they want to support it on.
2258280	2259840	That's kind of big news, I guess.
2259840	2262440	I don't know, I guess they could patch it later.
2262440	2263840	That might be kind of neat.
2263840	2269800	All right, well, we're going to go now to a new segment, which is a new game.
2269800	2272560	We're going to play a new game tonight, so Loki, you know I'm going to suck you into
2272560	2273560	playing this game.
2273560	2274560	You ready for it?
2274560	2275560	Sure.
2275560	2276560	All right.
2276560	2278120	No, you'll like this game.
2278120	2279120	Okay.
2279120	2280120	All right.
2280120	2282600	We thought we'd bring on a contestant of our choosing tonight.
2282600	2284600	Caller, are you there?
2284600	2285600	Yes, I am.
2285600	2286600	Hi.
2286600	2287600	Who is this?
2287600	2288600	This is Bobby from Atlanta.
2288600	2290280	Hi, Bobby from Atlanta.
2290280	2295000	Hey, is this the same Bobby that does his own show on Sunday nights on another network?
2295000	2296000	You know it is.
2296000	2297000	Of course.
2297000	2302000	See now, there's a reason why I invited Bobby to be the first one to play this new game
2302000	2303000	here on the show.
2303000	2308280	It's because there's been a little bit of smack talking in the past between Loki and
2308280	2314120	Bobby and ChromeHounds, which never happened, and we're going to play each other these games,
2314120	2315120	and it never really happened.
2315120	2316400	No, it didn't.
2316400	2321880	So I decided we here at Orange Laundry would provide an opportunity for there to be a great
2321880	2323800	podcast war, if you will.
2323800	2324800	Okay.
2324800	2325800	All right.
2325800	2326800	So are you ready, Bobby?
2326800	2327800	Are you going to kick Loki's ass?
2327800	2328800	Yes, I will.
2328800	2329800	All right.
2329800	2330800	He sounds quite confident.
2330800	2331800	Two words.
2331800	2332800	Shenanigans.
2332800	2333800	Shenanigans.
2333800	2342840	All right, well, we're going to play a brand new game, and it's called the Video Game Showdown.
2342840	2349840	It's horrible music, dude.
2349840	2352920	I have no reason why we're using the pressure lock theme for this, but I just wanted an
2352920	2356080	excuse to use the pressure lock theme at some point during the program.
2356080	2361320	All right, the Video Game Showdown is a brand new game here on Orange Laundry Radio.
2361320	2363200	Here is how it's going to work.
2363200	2368920	Now first things first, no fair using Google or the internet to cheat at this game, because
2368920	2371880	some of you people can do your research mighty fast, so no fair.
2371880	2372880	You're on your honor.
2372880	2374800	Okay, Bobby, I want a fair fight.
2374800	2379240	Am I allowed to at least write things down?
2379240	2380480	Yes, you can write things down.
2380480	2381480	That's certainly acceptable.
2381480	2382480	You just can't research.
2382480	2384240	You have to be on your own here.
2384240	2385240	All right.
2385240	2386240	So this is how it's going to work.
2386240	2391480	I'm going to read you a list of ten items in a category, but only five of them actually
2391480	2392520	apply.
2392520	2397040	So you have to guess which five are the correct answers.
2397040	2398460	Here's tonight's category.
2398460	2406460	Tonight's category is, per the website video game charts, five of these games are the top
2406460	2413180	five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.
2413180	2420680	So tonight's topic is the top five best-selling worldwide DS games to date.
2420680	2422680	You ready for the list?
2422680	2423680	Sure.
2423680	2424680	All right.
2424680	2425680	Here we go.
2425680	2426680	Here's your ten options.
2426680	2435280	Animal Crossing Wild World, Brain Training, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart
2435280	2449080	DS, Metroid Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris
2449080	2451880	DS, and WarioWare.
2451880	2458880	Again, of those ten I just named, five of them are the best-selling worldwide DS games
2458880	2459880	to date.
2459880	2462680	Here it is again one more time real quick, and then we'll get the answers.
2462680	2468480	Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Kart DS, Metroid
2468480	2476480	Prime Hunters, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, Super Mario 64, Tetris DS, and WarioWare.
2476480	2479080	Loki, you about ready?
2479080	2480080	I am ready.
2480080	2481080	You're ready?
2481080	2482080	Yeah.
2482080	2483080	All right.
2483080	2484080	What's the five you're going to pick, Loki?
2484080	2491680	The five I'm going to pick, Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario
2491680	2493880	Brothers, and Nintendogs.
2493880	2494880	All right.
2494880	2496800	Bobby, which five are you going to pick?
2496800	2505080	My five are Brain Training, Mario DS, New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs, and Super
2505080	2506680	Mario 64.
2506680	2507680	All right.
2507680	2508680	There they are.
2508680	2512800	Very similar list, only one difference between them, and that could be the make or break.
2512800	2513800	Here's what happens.
2513800	2519560	If we have a tie, and Bobby and Loki have the same amount correct, then Bobby can either
2519560	2523660	change one of his own answers after I tell him how many he has right, or he can force
2523660	2528080	Loki to change one of his, so that way we prevent a tie.
2528080	2533400	Let's first check the correct answers and see if we have a tie tonight.
2533400	2537480	It looks like we do not have a tie tonight.
2537480	2539200	All right.
2539200	2542080	Bobby, we'll start with you.
2542080	2544440	You got four right.
2544440	2545440	Four out of five right.
2545440	2546440	Not bad.
2546440	2547440	Brain Training is correct.
2547440	2549800	Mario Kart DS is correct.
2549800	2553240	New Super Mario Brothers is correct, and Nintendogs is correct.
2553240	2558080	Those are four, but Loki, that bastard got all five of them right.
2558080	2559080	Hell yeah.
2559080	2560080	I can't believe it.
2560080	2561320	I was concentrating on Japan.
2561320	2562320	Did you cheat?
2562320	2563320	No, I wasn't.
2563320	2566280	I concentrated on thinking about what was popular in Japan.
2566280	2567280	All right.
2567280	2568280	That's right.
2568280	2572680	The top five selling games of all time, Animal Crossing, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, New
2572680	2575320	Super Mario Brothers, and Nintendogs.
2575320	2578560	Because they also packed in New Super Mario Brothers... No, actually, no, they didn't.
2578560	2579560	No, it wasn't a pack-in.
2579560	2580560	Yeah.
2580560	2581560	Well.
2581560	2582560	I was a good guess from Bobby.
2582560	2583560	Actually, it's a trick, though.
2583560	2587480	Mario 64 was actually number six, so it was really close.
2587480	2590560	My reasoning was just because it was one of the few games out when it launched.
2590560	2591560	Yeah.
2591560	2592560	No, it was a good guess.
2592560	2596360	Animal Crossing, yeah, was kind of a surprise, but the game was really big, pretty much around
2596360	2597360	the world.
2597360	2598360	I mean, they're making a movie based on it.
2598360	2599360	Come on.
2599360	2600360	It's got to be pretty big.
2600360	2601360	All right.
2601360	2603120	Well, good job, Bobby.
2603120	2604120	You did really good.
2604120	2607480	Four out of five is not bad, and who knew that Loki had this superhuman power?
2607480	2608480	I guess I should have guessed.
2608480	2611840	Since he works in distribution, you probably know something about sales figures.
2611840	2612840	I cry in shame.
2612840	2613840	I'm sorry, Bobby.
2613840	2614840	But you know what?
2614840	2616600	Hey, we'll give you a chance to plug your show.
2616600	2619160	Yeah, something you want to share about what's going on on the Bobby Black Wolf show this
2619160	2620160	week?
2620160	2623600	Well, on the Bobby Black Wolf show, we actually had an interview this week talking to the
2623600	2630400	organizer of the 2006 Interactive Fiction Competition, which is basically text and video
2630400	2632320	games done today.
2632320	2635960	And so the art form really has progressed, and we talked to him about the competition,
2635960	2638080	how you can judge, and how you can be a part of all that.
2638080	2640160	So I thought it was a really interesting interview.
2640160	2641160	Very cool.
2641160	2642320	We haven't had an interview on this program in a long time.
2642320	2643640	We need to get some interviews.
2643640	2645200	How about all games as a whole?
2645200	2646520	We do our show.
2646520	2649000	It rebroadcasts Monday nights over on All Games.
2649000	2652920	There's lots of other podcasters that get in on it, so sometimes there's tournaments
2652920	2654400	of people coming together or what have you.
2654400	2656240	What's new in the world of all games this week?
2656240	2659480	Well, we've actually added three new affiliate radio programs.
2659480	2660480	Dang!
2660480	2665440	We've got – that's like a mom coming home from the adoption agency saying, we adopted
2665440	2666440	triplets.
2666440	2668440	No, that's great, though.
2668440	2669800	We've got newbies.
2669800	2670800	We adopted newbies.
2670800	2671800	Who's in the family now?
2671800	2676080	Well, we've got a Game Addict Hotline, which is a 20-minute podcast.
2676080	2679200	It's got some trivia in it, but it's really short every week.
2679200	2683760	We have Evil Avatar Radio, which is a spin-off of the Evil Avatar forums.
2683760	2689280	And then we also have XBL Radio, who does the Xbox Live community chats and stuff.
2689280	2690280	Oh, very cool.
2690280	2691280	Well, what nights are those on?
2691280	2693400	Do we have a set schedule for that yet?
2693400	2694400	Yeah.
2694400	2698760	XBL Radio is on Tuesday, Evil Avatar is on Wednesday, and Game Addict Hotline is on Thursday.
2698760	2699760	Very nice.
2699760	2701080	Well, congratulations to those guys.
2701080	2704720	We're happy to see them on board, and we'll be looking forward to that over at AllGames.com.
2704720	2705720	Yep.
2705720	2706720	All right.
2706720	2708420	Bobby, thanks so much for playing our little game tonight.
2708420	2712920	And next time, I'll do a topic maybe about video games in Atlanta or something that Loki
2712920	2714720	couldn't get.
2714720	2716600	There wouldn't be five things in that.
2716600	2722040	Wait, I thought Atlanta was one of the top five cities for gaming right under Seattle.
2722040	2723040	It is.
2723040	2727800	But in terms of video games being based here, I think Midnight Club 3 was here, and that's
2727800	2730520	about it, unless you count sports games.
2730520	2731520	Hmm.
2731520	2732520	Interesting.
2732520	2734400	I guess they just sell a lot there.
2734400	2737880	You guys have to stay indoors, because it's so damn humid outside.
2737880	2738880	It's not the heat.
2738880	2739880	It's the stupidity.
2739880	2740880	All right.
2740880	2741880	Bobby, thanks so much for playing our game tonight.
2741880	2742880	We appreciate it.
2742880	2743880	Have a good one, all right?
2743880	2744880	You too.
2744880	2745880	All right.
2745880	2749080	Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, ladies and gentlemen, from AllGames.com, does his own program over
2749080	2752280	there Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
2752280	2756120	A lot of our live listeners actually listen to his show as a bit of a warm-up before they
2756120	2757920	come over to Orange Launch Radio, so that's pretty cool.
2757920	2758920	That is pretty cool.
2758920	2759920	All right.
2759920	2760920	Let's go back to the news.
2760920	2761920	All right.
2761920	2764880	We're talking about games being leaked out early and stuff.
2764880	2773440	Well, this has to do with mod ship and HD loader programs out there, and, well, actually,
2773440	2780040	some of the major ones were actually nailed for over $9 million recently.
2780040	2785040	The ESA announced that a federal court in California ordered a group of defendants to
2785040	2791840	pay over $9 million in damages for violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and
2791840	2800200	the violations were against Devinio, the maker and distributor of mod ships for all consoles,
2800200	2808040	French resident Max Loem, and Canadian resident Frederic Leggett for trafficking of mod ships
2808040	2813320	and software circumvention device called HD loader.
2813320	2817960	And yeah, it's basically, of course, the HD loader, for those who might not know, was
2817960	2822840	a device that was available on the market for a while, allowing you to dump games to
2822840	2830440	a hard drive built into your older PlayStation 2, whether that be one that you provide or
2830440	2834280	the official Sony hard drive, and you can put games on there.
2834280	2835280	I have one.
2835280	2838480	I love my HD loader because it allows me to play import games.
2838480	2841800	And it just loads things faster, too, on the HD loader.
2841800	2842800	It does load things faster.
2842800	2844400	I like not just having to switch out the disks and everything.
2844400	2845400	I love it.
2845400	2847880	I don't know how a bachelor pad looks around the TV.
2847880	2851920	There's disks everywhere outside of their case because we're all too damn lazy to put
2851920	2852920	it back in the right case.
2852920	2857600	What I liked using it for is before I got my 360, when I used to take my PlayStation
2857600	2862480	2 to work to play games, I didn't have to carry around like 50 disks with me.
2862480	2866120	They're all dumped to my hard drive, so I can just bring my PlayStation 2 and a couple
2866120	2869780	controllers and the hookups, and away I go.
2869780	2871960	And plus the load times were a lot less.
2871960	2873280	So in DDR, it was awesome.
2873280	2877400	It was like instantly into the song.
2877400	2879440	But it's gotten worse since then.
2879440	2884520	Before, when I first got it, you had a cap of 120 gigs you can pretty much use now.
2884520	2892000	Now it supports up to two terabyte drives that you can hook up via USB.
2892000	2894080	You can literally put almost every single game out there.
2894080	2897320	Yeah, but you can also go rent games and then load them on your HD loader, and then you
2897320	2898320	have them forever.
2898320	2901160	Not that you'd know anything about that, would you, Loki?
2901160	2902160	No, I wouldn't.
2902160	2906240	I'm beyond renting games nowadays.
2906240	2914400	Who needs the rent games when they're freely available on the internet?
2914400	2919360	There is a speculation going out there that the European PlayStation 3 delay, because
2919360	2922920	you know how the European folks, especially if you're a Sony fan over there, got screwed
2922920	2924880	when it comes to the PlayStation 3's release.
2924880	2927560	Hey, no worries, rumor is we're going to get screwed too.
2927560	2930920	Everybody's going to get screwed with the PlayStation 3 release, but who knows?
2930920	2936540	The speculation is that it could threaten US publishers.
2936540	2940240	Just because it's releasing late in Europe doesn't mean you won't have an impact here
2940240	2942880	in the United States.
2942880	2948320	That's 500,000 PlayStation 3's that were expected to go to Europe at the end of this year.
2948320	2953100	Now that's 500,000 less consumers to sell games to.
2953100	2956280	Publishers are probably going to delay games that they previously were going to release
2956280	2961000	this year to 2007 just to take advantage of the greater user base in Europe.
2961000	2963040	So they'll all get screwed by this.
2963040	2966240	Isn't this kind of what you were saying earlier?
2966240	2967600	That's for a whole different reason.
2967600	2972040	That's for the fact that they haven't gotten their dev kits in a timely manner and so they're
2972040	2973520	not able to finish the game, period.
2973520	2980680	No, I'm talking about earlier in the program you were talking about how sometimes, like
2980680	2985120	say the Wii sells 9 million units, I think you said this in part A, then that's 9 million
2985120	2987960	available systems for people to want to publish for.
2987960	2990040	Is it the same logic here?
2990040	2992600	In a sense, yes.
2992600	2997520	But you can't really apply, like say if there's 500,000 units in the United States, that doesn't
2997520	2999900	mean they're not going to release a game here.
2999900	3004360	If there's no systems obviously in the UK, they're going to delay the launch of a game
3004360	3005360	there.
3005360	3008480	But just because Europe doesn't have their game system yet does not mean that they won't
3008480	3010480	launch their US copies here first.
3010480	3014140	So not only will Europe get screwed by the release of the system, but now all their games
3014140	3016000	are going to be delayed six months because of this.
3016000	3022840	No, they'll just come out when the PlayStation 3 launches instead of just being launched
3022840	3023840	at the same time.
3023840	3028440	I mean, the same thing happens with different region games, like Tomb Raider will come out
3028440	3030760	in the UK first and then it will come out over here.
3030760	3037380	It does not mean, for example, we can release PlayStation 3 games here first and then just
3037380	3039200	wait to release them there.
3039200	3044420	It doesn't matter because they need time anyways to, I guess, print more copies.
3044420	3049000	One interesting thing though I have to add to this was that there was an interview with
3049000	3056200	the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe World, Vice President Jamie McDonald, and he claims
3056200	3060640	that Europeans don't mind that they have to wait an extra four months for the console.
3060640	3065560	And they asked him, what would you say to consumers who like Sony and want to buy your
3065560	3071240	product but perhaps feel because they're in Europe they will always be last in line?
3071240	3076120	And he says, European consumers have shown that historically they don't mind that because
3076120	3080120	they end up buying as many PlayStations, if not more, than the US and Japan.
3080120	3084640	In Europe it doesn't seem that the release of our platforms after the US and Japan in
3084640	3087840	the long run affects how consumers feel.
3087840	3093140	I think some of our listeners over in the old country might feel a little different.
3093140	3096000	I don't know guys, is it just me or do you feel a little different than what this guy
3096000	3097000	is saying?
3097000	3099680	Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.
3099680	3104040	So he's saying basically, well since Europe usually gets screwed, you know, we're kind
3104040	3105040	of used to it.
3105040	3111120	You know, they're assholes stretched out now, it doesn't matter if we fuck them again.
3111120	3114560	That's pretty much what it comes down to.
3114560	3132760	It's like kids say the darndest things, all we need now, we're just missing Bill Cosby
3132760	3138400	and we've got another show all together here.
3138400	3140680	I want to say this real quick before we get into the next story because there's something
3140680	3144040	I wanted to talk about that for whatever reason isn't on the show roll because it was actually
3144040	3149480	kind of a busy week for news with the whole GameStop conference and the systems coming
3149480	3150480	out soon.
3150480	3156560	There was a story, an opinion piece, does Sony need a figure like Major Nelson?
3156560	3163120	Because Major Nelson is sort of like the internet guy for the Xbox 360 and in a way he's kind
3163120	3165440	of a viral campaign in a way, you know what I mean?
3165440	3171540	He starts Buzz on his blog and he's a popular guy, he's on the system playing the games,
3171540	3175520	people have run into him on Test Drive Unlimited and stuff, and you go over to Nintendo and
3175520	3188680	you have very charismatic folks like Reggie and Miyamoto, but Sony has these guys, as
3188680	3192920	Jamie calls them, the crayon eaters and bike helmet, which by the way, the photoshops in
3192920	3196240	our forum that you guys did, fucking hilarious.
3196240	3197240	We have the best listeners.
3197240	3200960	Seriously guys, if you've never visited our website, you must go to the forums just for
3200960	3208520	the people doing the photoshops of the amazing crayon eaters over at Sony, it's great.
3208520	3212480	Sony has these guys that make these crazy statements like this, you know, does Sony
3212480	3217120	need somebody a little more hip?
3217120	3218760	What they need is Willy Wonka.
3218760	3219760	Why?
3219760	3226200	Because it's going to take some fucking magic to sell those consoles.
3226200	3231080	Some news about Oblivion on the PSP, and we knew that there's got to be some, you know,
3231080	3234840	catch to this, they're not going to be able to put Oblivion that we saw on the 360 on
3234840	3236900	the PSP, there's no fucking way.
3236900	3243120	So what we did find out though, according to the, you know, that certain website's magazine,
3243120	3248600	the official PlayStation magazine, there is actually some info regarding the game, including
3248600	3254600	that it still has the create a character mode in it, but it will only have a few dungeons
3254600	3259360	that you get to play in, there's no open running around and whatnot to actually play through
3259360	3260360	the game.
3260360	3264120	But, you know, they're going to have some, they're talking to me.
3264120	3267920	Is any of it new, or are they just recycled dungeons from the existing Oblivion?
3267920	3268920	No idea.
3268920	3271600	If so, I mean, what the hell is the point?
3271600	3275480	It reminds me of those Game Boy Mortal Kombat games, which are fucking horrible compared
3275480	3279320	to the console ones, it's like, you know, we had to take out half the moves because
3279320	3281240	there's only two buttons and things like that.
3281240	3285840	I mean, granted the graphics for this Oblivion look kind of nice, but this is a game that
3285840	3290080	should just simply be played on the big screen, or on a computer screen.
3290080	3291080	Yeah, I'm...
3291080	3292080	I don't know.
3292080	3296920	I don't know, but I will suspend disbelief until I actually get to play, get my hands
3296920	3300280	on it and actually play it, but I worry about this whole concept.
3300280	3303340	I mean, at least do, why not like a little spinoff story?
3303340	3306280	Do some slightly different dungeons and do like a spinoff story, I think that would be
3306280	3307280	a lot more...
3307280	3308280	Yeah.
3308280	3309280	Well...
3309280	3310280	Wantable.
3310280	3317840	Yeah, it's interesting, but I don't know, the game itself looks pretty, I mean, not
3317840	3323920	as good as obviously the 360 one, but I don't know, it looks okay, and like you mentioned,
3323920	3329040	you know, cutting out skills and stuff, 18 of the original game's 21 skills are going
3329040	3333280	to be in the game, a couple of them stripped out.
3333280	3337920	I don't know, it's basically, why don't they just release like a 3D version of Diablo?
3337920	3342120	It's kind of like what this game is almost like, you know, where you pick up items and
3342120	3343760	just kind of grind at it.
3343760	3348760	Oh, I'm sure Diablo 3 will be something we're hearing about in 2007, so that's just my thought.
3348760	3352760	I swear I have not been ignoring you, chat room, over at orangelongeradio.com, click
3352760	3355700	on chat, my mind just got distracted with trying to set up that game and everything
3355700	3359040	a little bit ago, but it looks like Bobby Black Wolf is actually campaigning right now
3359040	3364320	to be the voice of Sony, so he'll get up there and be the voice of Sony.
3364320	3368160	I'll send you some Crayolas, Black Wolf, so you can start practicing, and then DMN
3368160	3373560	follows up with a Nokia needs Bobby Black Wolf, you know, the N-Gage needs a spokesman
3373560	3374560	too.
3374560	3380200	The problem with this, I mean, I really have trouble with them pushing games like the Eye
3380200	3384440	of Judgment, because it's going to take an elaborate setup to get to work, and to be
3384440	3390000	honest, the Eye Toy didn't work all that great, and just a lot of the games that are
3390000	3393680	coming out at launch, like Resistance, okay, it's a first person shooter that takes place
3393680	3398840	during World War II, which also happens to come out at the same time as Call of Duty
3398840	3402280	3, which is a first person shooter, takes place during World War II, granted one's
3402280	3409000	sci-fi, I mean, whatever, okay, so that's neat, but it's got some major competition.
3409000	3413040	You've got Lair, which is coming out, it's a dragon riding game, coming out also same
3413040	3417280	month as Aragon, which is also a dragon riding game, also dragon garden stuff, I mean, it's
3417280	3425520	a cool looking game, and then, you know, Motorstorm, which I don't even think is a launch title,
3425520	3429960	I know, and then they've got all the EA Sports games, and Carbon, you know, you first pick
3429960	3435640	Carbon, which is actually a pretty cool game, play the demo, and then the 2K Sports games,
3435640	3441360	but like, as far as exclusive titles, I mean, there's not a whole lot, and I think that's
3441360	3445600	really going to hurt them more than the fact that the console is three, you know, fucking
3445600	3449760	expensive and that there's not that many units out there, I think that there's, you know,
3449760	3453240	people that are like, actually going to want, I mean, there'll be people that pick up the
3453240	3456960	console, but a lot of people are like, well, I'm just going to wait until some more games
3456960	3457960	come out.
3457960	3462800	Well, Sony fans, if you feel differently, send Loki an email, mailbag at orangeontrader.com.
3462800	3466800	Meanwhile, let's move on to something for the Nintendo fans, and this is a little bit
3466800	3470240	more disappointment, I mean, we already heard about the consoles are definitely going to
3470240	3475520	be region locked, well, guess what, Eurogamer talked to a Nintendo UK spokesperson and they
3475520	3480640	confirmed that the Wii Virtual Console games will also be region locked.
3480640	3485680	The Virtual Console games will also not be universal, meaning that Eurogamers will get
3485680	3490020	Euro versions of the old games, so whether or not this means certain regions will have
3490020	3493960	to do without certain titles is unknown, but most likely, I mean, certain games were big
3493960	3495700	in Japan that weren't big over here.
3495700	3499500	The reason why I sound so depressed about this is because now I'm never going to get
3499500	3505520	my MSX games here in America, unless, well, obviously emulators and stuff, but come on,
3505520	3510120	I want to play the original Metal Gear, or Gardick.
3510120	3511120	Metal Gear here?
3511120	3515440	No, but the old school MSX, it was on the MSX before it was on the NES.
3515440	3521080	Well, and the true sequel to Metal Gear was not Snake's Revenge, but the true sequel to
3521080	3525680	Metal Gear was only on the MSX, but I get, well, they had the whole PlayStation 2 secret
3525680	3528200	thing, but whatever, I want it on the Virtual Console.
3528200	3530000	Gimme!
3530000	3531480	That's why I sound depressed, sorry.
3531480	3534780	I'm not too worried about it, I mean, big deal, I didn't play a lot of the import
3534780	3539680	games on the NES, and whatever, I mean, it's not like they were going to put all the games
3539680	3544840	on there anyways, I mean, so, you know, do I really need a Japanese version of Zelda
3544840	3545840	on there?
3545840	3546840	No.
3546840	3550680	Rama speculates maybe you can get a Japanese Wii Connect 24 account.
3550680	3554960	Black Boy says he was looking forward to Doki Doki, right, Doki Doki Panic, the inspiration
3554960	3555960	for Super Mario Bros. 2?
3555960	3559480	Well, I mean, the consoles themselves are probably region locked, but I'm sure you
3559480	3562760	could probably, like, disable it or change that to something else, you know?
3562760	3566720	Well, it's very easy to get a Japanese Xbox 360 account, so maybe that same logic, but
3566720	3569680	at the same time, it's hard to pay for that, you know what I mean?
3569680	3572760	Like, you can't really, like, you only get the Japanese accounts, you can download their
3572760	3576640	free demos and trailers, but you can't, you know, buy things on their store, really.
3576640	3582680	Well, luckily, there's no real money involved, it's basically the Nintendo Points cards,
3582680	3585360	or points, and you know what, you can still do that.
3585360	3587600	And what if the points cards were region locked?
3587600	3588600	No.
3588600	3591040	Only the Amer- No, the points cards are just universal.
3591040	3594640	And what's interesting, though, see, like, there is going to be some Xbox Live games
3594640	3597720	that are exclusive to Japan, and I was going to buy them on my one account because you
3597720	3603560	can actually play them on your, you know, U.S. account, too, so I would download the
3603560	3608000	demo on my Japanese account and register them on my U.S. account.
3608000	3611400	GS68 says I want the Famicom version of Gradius 2.
3611400	3616800	See, all these great games that really didn't ever come over here, and I, Nintendo, I think
3616800	3622560	you ought to reconsider this, or at least, if you're going to do this, please give the
3622560	3626480	U.S. gamers a shot at some of these games they never played, I bet there's, you know,
3626480	3627480	money to be made there.
3627480	3630160	Well, I think a lot of this, though, is going to be to eliminate confusion, I mean, if you're,
3630160	3634880	you know, a normal consumer out there, I mean, what if you don't want to download the Japanese
3634880	3638560	version of a certain game, and you might accidentally do that, and then you've wasted your money
3638560	3639560	on this game?
3639560	3645200	I mean, there's no amount of clear marketing that's going to stop stupid people from, you
3645200	3648760	know, injuring themselves or downloading something they shouldn't be.
3648760	3650160	All right, I'm done being emo.
3650160	3654440	You know, there's not anymore you can do, but whatever.
3654440	3659520	Some interesting stuff, though, Reggie over in Nintendo there is contradicting some of
3659520	3666200	the info we've gotten about the pricing for the, you know, the web browser for the Wii,
3666200	3670560	and, you know, his comments were basically, in fairness for the Americas, we haven't made
3670560	3675160	the business decision for how and what we're going to do with the browser.
3675160	3679400	We recognize for most people browser is pretty standard, the concept of charging a significant
3679400	3682840	amount of Wii points to get the browser is somewhat challenging.
3682840	3684760	We're going to work through that.
3684760	3689400	So basically saying, you know, we haven't announced anything yet about it.
3689400	3694760	I don't know why they would charge for the browser, that's kind of weird, but whatever.
3694760	3698000	I mean, if it's like a buck or something, I guess you're paying for licensing maybe
3698000	3701440	for Opera, I mean, I don't know.
3701440	3705200	Make it ad supported or something, I don't know.
3705200	3709960	There is a third party Wiimote coming out, Pelican is making it.
3709960	3717000	This is very interesting because, you know, the Wiimote is an expensive piece of equipment,
3717000	3720120	is what, like 50 bucks, 40, 50 bucks it's retailing for?
3720120	3721120	$39.99.
3721120	3722120	$39.99.
3722120	3724840	It's very interesting that a third party is going to jump in and try to make their own
3724840	3728980	version of the Wiimote, but usually third party controllers aren't quite as good as
3728980	3729980	first party.
3729980	3733520	For me, I kind of go, uh-oh, if I were Nintendo, I'd be concerned about this because this is
3733520	3734960	kind of like market saturation, isn't it?
3734960	3736520	Well, they're the ones that have to approve it.
3736520	3738520	Well, I guess that's true.
3738520	3741560	I bet it won't come out right away, that's for sure.
3741560	3747640	I don't know, great, but I don't know.
3747640	3750600	It's a little scary because a lot of the, especially the wireless controllers, you know,
3750600	3752640	they kind of suck, but whatever.
3752640	3758480	Anyway, Ari Masan says, Nintendo will sue.
3758480	3762320	There's some controversy now, this is about the dumbest things too, about the light on
3762320	3769520	the front of the Wii surrounding the disk drive, whether it's going to be on or off.
3769520	3775120	During the Nintendo Fusion Tour, there's actually the light was completely turned off and some
3775120	3778720	people are like, well, hey, I want my light on, you know, what the hell?
3778720	3781040	That's my theory on this whole thing.
3781040	3785000	Basically what they've come out and said, the rep, was that the light's only going to
3785000	3790600	be on when you put a disk in or when you turn the console on and that it's going to turn
3790600	3791600	off later on.
3791600	3796880	I think there's either going to be an option to keep it on or the fact that probably those
3796880	3801840	games that you were playing weren't running on that Wii, they were probably running on
3801840	3807160	a dev kit that was below the Wii and that the system just wasn't plugged in.
3807160	3811760	Now I was going to say, when we went to the Konami thing, didn't we see Elibits, the thing
3811760	3813080	was glowing the whole time?
3813080	3814080	Yeah, exactly.
3814080	3817080	But of course that same logic could apply, it could have been hooked up to a dev kit,
3817080	3818080	doesn't mean shit.
3818080	3823440	And they could have just had the console plugged in and turned on and so the light glows, but
3823440	3827800	if it's hooked, you're actually playing off of a dev kit and not the actual system.
3827800	3832760	So in theory you could just, if you're limited on plugs or whatever for power, you could
3832760	3838000	just not plug that in and just set that there because it's just for the illusion that you're
3838000	3842600	playing with the actual Wii and not a dev kit, whereas some people, like Sony, just
3842600	3846000	like to put the rackmount servers out there for everyone to see.
3846000	3847880	Alright, that makes sense.
3847880	3851120	Alright, well we'll see what happens.
3851120	3854640	Alright, well we are going to go now to the portion of the show where you guys get to
3854640	3857120	help out and that is by the Skype line.
3857120	3861640	Just head on over to orangelauntrady.com, click on interact with us and you can learn
3861640	3864600	about how to call us here live.
3864600	3867560	Our username on Skype is orangelauntrady or you can always pick up the phone and call
3867560	3869560	us, 916-226-9067.
3869560	3875400	Can't remember if I mentioned it last week, but there is an 800 number coming soon because
3875400	3878960	the number we have now is not toll free, but by the end of the month we're going to have
3878960	3880840	a toll free number, which is very exciting.
3880840	3882920	I'm very much looking forward to that.
3882920	3885920	And then we'll have a lot more folks wanting to call in, I'm sure, and we'll probably bring
3885920	3889240	back voicemails of the week at that point because we think more of you guys might want
3889240	3892720	to contribute if you have a toll free number to use because most of you are just too lazy
3892720	3893720	for Skype, I guess.
3893720	3894720	Let's go to the phones.
3894720	3896680	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3896680	3897680	Who's this?
3897680	3898680	Hi, it's Rama.
3898680	3899680	What's up, guys?
3899680	3900680	Hi, Rama.
3900680	3901680	How you doing?
3901680	3902680	What's on your mind?
3902680	3903680	Not much, not much.
3903680	3908440	I'm trying to quote the last part of the show, but I just got back from another anime convention.
3908440	3909600	Another anime convention?
3909600	3910600	Which one this time?
3910600	3911600	It's manga.
3911600	3916560	It's nothing but a convention about manga and fans and stuff like that.
3916560	3917560	So no video games?
3917560	3923240	Yes, there were video games, there were no tournaments, but let's just say older gamers
3923240	3927480	like us would have cried tears of joy at the games that were there.
3927480	3929000	What did they bring?
3929000	3933200	Well, we saw a working Nintendo set up with Super Mario Bros. 3.
3933200	3934200	That's pretty hot.
3934200	3935200	Did they have Guardian Legend?
3935200	3936200	No, they don't have that.
3936200	3939840	They're the guys that ran the game and told them next year.
3939840	3940840	All right.
3940840	3941840	That works for me.
3941840	3944480	Anything else you want to share about the con?
3944480	3945480	What else?
3945480	3950440	It was fun and it was basically drama-free because everybody just had to have a good
3950440	3951440	time.
3951440	3952440	There was no...
3952440	3954760	Nobody bashing Orange Moms Radio to you this year?
3954760	3959720	No, not this year, not this year.
3959720	3963920	We love our anime fans that go to the conventions and then bash us to other people.
3963920	3964920	That's lovely.
3964920	3965920	No, I'm done.
3965920	3966920	I'm just using...
3966920	3967920	No one disagrees.
3967920	3968920	It's cool.
3968920	3969920	Whatever.
3969920	3971360	People have their varying opinions.
3971360	3973880	There's about 500 video game podcasts out there.
3973880	3975600	If you don't like this one, go find another one.
3975600	3976600	Just make...
3976600	3977600	Keep it independent is all we ask.
3977600	3978600	Definitely.
3978600	3979600	Of course.
3979600	3980600	All right.
3980600	3981600	Anything else you want to share?
3981600	3983600	Let's talk about the games.
3983600	3990040	There's a few Super Nintendo set up, a couple of PlayStation, and yes, there was Guitar
3990040	3992280	Hero on the big screen.
3992280	3994280	There was what?
3994280	3995640	Guitar Hero on the big screen.
3995640	3997320	Oh, Guitar Hero on the big screen.
3997320	3998320	How did that go over?
3998320	4000140	That was pretty nice.
4000140	4005200	That and DDR Extreme 2 were the top five.
4005200	4010960	You also had Nairochimate Hero 4 and Battle Station D.O.N. are also popular.
4010960	4012440	All right.
4012440	4017080	Well, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, okay?
4017080	4018080	Excellent.
4018080	4019080	All right.
4019080	4022520	Have a good one and we hope for some more old school gaming goodness at the next con.
4022520	4023520	Game right.
4023520	4024520	All right.
4024520	4025520	See you guys later.
4025520	4026520	Later.
4026520	4028040	Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.
4028040	4029040	Hello.
4029040	4030040	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4030040	4031040	Yes.
4031040	4032040	Hey.
4032040	4033040	This is Al Mullet calling.
4033040	4034040	Hey.
4034040	4035040	We remember you.
4035040	4036200	You haven't called into this show in a long time.
4036200	4037400	How are you, Al Mullet?
4037400	4038960	I am doing just fine, Sky.
4038960	4039960	I'm doing just fine.
4039960	4041600	Have you ever called into the podcast?
4041600	4042600	I don't think so.
4042600	4043600	No.
4043600	4044800	This is my first podcast call.
4044800	4045800	Your podcast debut.
4045800	4048400	I know you used to listen to the three-hour show back in the day.
4048400	4049540	Oh, yes.
4049540	4050540	That was fun times.
4050540	4053980	Now, from one of the crazy random times, no, that's great.
4053980	4054980	We love our history.
4054980	4057600	Now, you're getting married next week, right?
4057600	4058600	Yes, I am.
4058600	4059600	Yes, I am.
4059600	4060600	Congratulations.
4060600	4061600	Thank you very much.
4061600	4063600	Is she a gamer?
4063600	4064600	Slightly.
4064600	4065600	I am learning her.
4065600	4066600	Okay.
4066600	4067600	All right.
4067600	4068600	That's good.
4068600	4069600	There's got to be compromise in a relationship, right, Logie?
4069600	4070600	Exactly.
4070600	4071600	Right, Logie?
4071600	4073680	We're mostly DS playing.
4073680	4076000	We do New Super Mario Brothers versus.
4076000	4077400	We do Tetris versus.
4077400	4078400	Okay.
4078400	4079400	Well, that's cool.
4079400	4080400	That's cool.
4080400	4081400	What did you want to call in about tonight?
4081400	4082400	What's up?
4082400	4083660	I basically wanted to say hi.
4083660	4084660	It's been a while.
4084660	4085660	It's your hand.
4085660	4089360	Are you still doing your column over at Inside Pulse?
4089360	4093200	Actually, hey, I have, quote, unquote, left Inside Pulse.
4093200	4095920	There's just been a lot of stuff going on.
4095920	4096920	I see.
4096920	4100560	I'm trying to find work, and obviously the marriage thing.
4100560	4107080	I mean, things have just been, lots of stuff been going on, and I've been trying to catch
4107080	4109160	up on everything recently.
4109160	4110160	I understand.
4110160	4112320	Lives go through chaos sometimes.
4112320	4113320	It's fully understandable.
4113320	4115000	Well, what games have you been playing recently?
4115000	4116520	Did you check out DDR Supernova?
4116520	4117520	Oh, yes.
4117520	4119800	I've been having a blast with that game.
4119800	4120800	Yeah?
4120800	4125800	There are a few songs I could have done without, but I like the setup of Stellar Master Mode.
4125800	4134480	I really like the fact, I think it's the best, what's the word, console licenses.
4134480	4139760	I think it's the best lineup thus far, especially songs like The Other Side, Turn Up the Music,
4139760	4144520	L.E.F., A Lot of Electronic Ferocious, and Shivers.
4144520	4146160	Shivers is awesome.
4146160	4149360	How do you think the game compares to the other PlayStation 2 releases that are out
4149360	4150360	there?
4150360	4151360	It's kind of interesting.
4151360	4155040	I was just at Target the other day, and they had a DDR Supernova bundle right next to Extreme
4155040	4158200	2 bundles they still hadn't sold.
4158200	4163200	Definitely options are still available to the new DDR folks that want to get on board
4163200	4164200	with this.
4164200	4165640	How do you think it compares to the other ones?
4165640	4173480	Well, I definitely think that it's definitely on par with Extreme 2 as far as best US PS2
4173480	4174480	mix.
4174480	4180360	There's definitely stuff on there that make me go, wow, this is much better, but then
4180360	4184560	there are other things that make me go, hey, it was better in Extreme 2.
4184560	4191280	I think the course mode, we got shafted with course mode this time, because there's only
4191280	4196560	one difficulty level on everything, whereas last game, you had two difficulty levels on
4196560	4197560	everything.
4197560	4198560	Interesting.
4198560	4202120	What do you think about how the new Xbox games are shaping up?
4202120	4204000	I think they're shaping up really well.
4204000	4207640	Their podcasts are definitely making them more favorable by the day.
4207640	4211680	I appreciate that, and I'll let Konami know you said that.
4211680	4217600	No, seriously though, if you were still reviewing games for the website, how many stars out
4217600	4219480	of ten would you be given DDR Supernova?
4219480	4224000	DDR Supernova, well, that would be under the ten category review system.
4224000	4233200	I gave Extreme 2 a 7.5, and said that was the best one ever, which is like a 9.0 on
4233200	4235160	other websites.
4235160	4243840	I would say that Supernova would range between a 7.0, 7.5, because there's stuff that's better
4243840	4249720	and there's stuff that's worse, so it would be around the same score, I would think.
4249720	4250720	What's up with that?
4250720	4254760	You brought up an interesting point, is that a 7.5, the way you would review games, and
4254760	4259600	if I wrote game reviews, I would hope I would be very similar as well, where an average
4259600	4263320	game gets an average score in the middle.
4263320	4266880	But it seems like most game websites, you're right, kind of skew it towards the high end.
4266880	4268440	Here's what I would get.
4268440	4276040	For example, games that are reviewed on IGN, they'll have a score for each category, and
4276040	4279320	the score doesn't have anything to do with any category on there.
4279320	4285560	So for example, a game might score 7.5s across the board on all the other categories and
4285560	4287400	get a 6 overall.
4287400	4290160	Like okay, how the hell does that average out?
4290160	4293680	Or I'm thinking about Rotten Tomatoes, because they cover game reviews, they don't do it
4293680	4297400	quite as well as they do movies, but it says we only give a fresh rating if the site gave
4297400	4304240	it a 7 or better, because of the skewed people tend to give higher scores on game reviews.
4304240	4306400	Why do you think that is, Emily?
4306400	4311880	The problem is that so many of these numbers are pulled directly out of their asses, and
4311880	4315400	most of these numbers don't even correspond to what their written opinions are on the
4315400	4316400	game.
4316400	4323160	There are 7.0s on some sites and on some game reviews, and the bottom line is don't play
4323160	4324160	this.
4324160	4328600	It's the way that Inside Pulse reviews games.
4328600	4335960	It's out of a 10-category system, and it could really excel in some areas, but there are
4335960	4338000	other areas that could bring the game down.
4338000	4341080	A game could have a great story, but horrible graphics and sound.
4341080	4345360	The game could have great gameplay mechanics, but it could only be fun for the first three
4345360	4355080	hours and basically the games have to be really awesome in all categories to get 8 and above,
4355080	4359080	but a game can be worth playing at a 7 or even a 6.
4359080	4361240	Alright, yeah, that's true.
4361240	4368200	I was going to say, I hope to see that you come back to the internet soon reviewing games
4368200	4373360	and sticking to the more realistic scale that you started over there.
4373360	4377640	You just might see a Supernova review before the end of the week, assuming I have enough
4377640	4378640	time.
4378640	4379640	Very cool.
4379640	4381640	Well, El Mullet, I've got to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you
4381640	4382940	so much for calling in.
4382940	4383940	Thank you.
4383940	4384940	Have a good one, buddy.
4384940	4385940	You too.
4385940	4386940	Alright, bye-bye.
4386940	4387940	Bye.
4387940	4389280	How exciting, a wedding, getting married and all that fun stuff.
4389280	4390280	Let's go to another call.
4390280	4391800	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4391800	4392800	Who's this?
4392800	4394800	Ultimate Gamer from chat.
4394800	4397520	Well, I'm currently not in chat right now.
4397520	4399000	Alright, well hello Ultimate Gamer.
4399000	4400000	What's on your mind, buddy?
4400000	4411520	Yeah, I'm just thinking about the Xbox 360 and now it has a $200 HD DVD drive, and am
4411520	4418120	I just going to have to... Should I just get a PS3?
4418120	4426600	Because since the Blu-ray drive is implemented into the PS3 and games are actually on Blu-ray
4426600	4427600	discs.
4427600	4428600	Gotcha.
4428600	4429600	Okay, I see.
4429600	4431600	Here's the thing, though.
4431600	4434920	Are you interested in just playing movies with this device, or are you going to be playing
4434920	4437040	games as well?
4437040	4444360	I mean, I'm mostly getting the PS3 for games, but I know the Xbox 360 has some good games.
4444360	4445360	Right.
4445360	4447260	Because the PS3s are actually on Blu-ray discs.
4447260	4453600	I think it really boils down to which console has the games that you want, and Microsoft
4453600	4458400	gets a lot of heat usually because they overlook, or at least they have in the past, they don't
4458400	4461280	have a lot of solid role-playing type games.
4461280	4465020	They don't have a lot of solid action games, and they've been trying to correct that.
4465020	4468400	You've got Blue Dragon coming out, and they had Cameo.
4468400	4472860	Take that for whatever it's worth, but Sony's always excelled in that range, but on the
4472860	4477840	flip side, Sony doesn't seem to have a strong lineup right now, so you have to look more
4477840	4482900	into the future at what Sony's got, and Microsoft is trying to correct themselves, and you saw
4482900	4484320	that with Tokyo Game Show.
4484320	4487260	They're trying to take a more broad approach to different games, so you really have to
4487260	4491640	ask yourself, which of these two systems is going to have the games I want to play?
4491640	4495040	Because remember what we always say, the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as
4495040	4498480	the games that are on it, and when it comes down to the whole, I guess here's another
4498480	4499780	question I have for you.
4499780	4501560	Where does the Wii stand in your mind?
4501560	4502880	Do you not care about the Wii?
4502880	4503880	Heck no.
4503880	4505520	I mean, the Wii is one of them.
4505520	4509440	I'm definitely going to get the Wii at launch.
4509440	4513840	Right, but the thing is, the Wii doesn't have any of that, and the Wiis not have a Blu-ray
4513840	4514840	player.
4514840	4516220	Hell, it doesn't even have a DVD player.
4516220	4518160	So that system is really about the games.
4518160	4521320	You are buying that system for the games and the games only.
4521320	4525560	So I would say take that same logic and put it on Xbox 360 versus Playstation 3, because
4525560	4529120	it's not really going to matter Blu-ray, HD, DVD, whatever.
4529120	4530760	It's going to be really about the games in the end.
4530760	4531760	I'm going to be honest.
4531760	4534160	I've seen Blu-ray and HD DVD side-by-side.
4534160	4536340	It's really not that much different.
4536340	4539240	The spec-wise, they're about the same too, other than data.
4539240	4543480	But I do understand what you're saying is that Sony, and I do agree this could be to
4543480	4548960	their advantage in three years, is that Sony has the native Blu-ray support for the games,
4548960	4554880	and while right now it's causing the system to cost your first-born child, later on, when
4554880	4560700	we get further down within the subdivisions of this generation, that could really benefit
4560700	4561700	them in the end.
4561700	4566960	But I don't know, for me, I'm kind of like, well then I'll buy the PS3 when it's got those
4566960	4567960	games.
4567960	4574160	Well, what I'm saying is with the Blu-ray disc, it's going to actually be a high-definition
4574160	4579920	disc, whereas the Xbox 360, it's just like having an HDTV will make the game high-definition.
4579920	4580920	True.
4580920	4581920	That's true.
4581920	4586660	But also, don't forget, the other part I'm trying to say here is that doesn't it boil
4586660	4588760	down to how good the games are, though?
4588760	4592920	Not necessarily how they look, because being on Blu-ray, certainly they're going to look
4592920	4593920	better.
4593920	4597020	But if you're going to buy a Wii, then you must already be into that school of thought
4597020	4599400	that it really is about the fun games.
4599400	4605400	And granted that Blu-ray does have more storage available to it, doesn't mean, though, that
4605400	4609480	they'll use it all, and also doesn't mean that the games that are on DVD-9s are going
4609480	4613300	to look any less brilliant than, say, a PlayStation 3 game.
4613300	4616040	Look at Gears of War and Resistance, perfect example.
4616040	4619760	They both look very good, and one's on DVD, one's on Blu-ray.
4619760	4624240	It's just compression technology and whatnot.
4624240	4628920	Don't shop based on specs, shop on what games are good, what you're looking for to get out
4628920	4634040	of the system, because if you shop on specs, it's just going to be ridiculous.
4634040	4637120	Here's my closing thought for you, I suppose, Ultimate Gamer.
4637120	4643200	After all, your name is Ultimate Gamer, get a second job and buy them both.
4643200	4646320	I'm just messing with you, but I know you're probably right now.
4646320	4651840	You want one this year, and maybe you'll get the other one next year?
4651840	4653720	Probably I know I'm getting the Wii first.
4653720	4662440	The PS3, I get a couple months down the road, but I think the games, they should be like
4662440	4667160	fully enough, but also good graphics.
4667160	4668160	You know what?
4668160	4669160	I think you're on the right track, then.
4669160	4672760	If the Wii is, it sounds like you really, really, really want the Wii, then go for that,
4672760	4676640	buy that, and then when you have enough money saved up for a second console, look at the
4676640	4680080	games that are out and or coming out and make your decision at that time.
4680080	4681440	Yeah, all right.
4681440	4682440	All right.
4682440	4685440	Thanks, really love the show, and a great RSS feed.
4685440	4690000	I listen to it on my PSP every week, and I get no buffering signs or anything.
4690000	4691000	Love it.
4691000	4695560	I'm glad to hear there's people still using OLRPSP.com, so, Loki, go update it.
4695560	4696560	It's all right.
4696560	4697560	Thank you.
4697560	4698560	We appreciate it.
4698560	4703160	I know sometimes we give the PSP a hard time on this show, but it is a great multimedia
4703160	4708160	multi-platform system, and we're really glad to be able to offer our podcast on it.
4708160	4709160	All right.
4709160	4710160	All right, have a good one, buddy.
4710160	4711160	Bye-bye.
4711160	4712160	All right, bye-bye.
4712160	4713160	Bye-bye.
4713160	4714160	That was a good call.
4714160	4715160	All right.
4715160	4716160	Let's go to another call here.
4716160	4717160	All right.
4717160	4718160	Hi.
4718160	4719160	You're on Orange Lawn's radio.
4719160	4720160	Who's this?
4720160	4721160	Am I on?
4721160	4722160	Yes, you are.
4722160	4723160	Sorry about that.
4723160	4724160	It's Legend of Zaku.
4724160	4725160	Hi, buddy.
4725160	4726160	What's on your mind?
4726160	4727160	Digitalize next week.
4727160	4728160	I know it is, and I'm not going.
4728160	4729160	I'm missing it by a week.
4729160	4730160	Wait.
4730160	4731160	Wasn't it this week?
4731160	4732160	No.
4732160	4733160	It's this weekend.
4733160	4734160	Oh, gotcha.
4734160	4735160	Okay.
4735160	4736160	I just, you know.
4736160	4746280	Yeah, I'm missing it by one week.
4746280	4747280	I know.
4747280	4751080	I should be able to dig you up some information on whatever you like.
4751080	4752080	We want to hear it all.
4752080	4755880	We want to hear from all the New York listeners next week that are going to this.
4755880	4758840	Yeah, I will report back since I'm competing.
4758840	4759840	All right.
4759840	4760840	So, great.
4760840	4761840	It's all next week.
4761840	4762840	What do you want to talk about now?
4762840	4768080	Well, basically, I mean Nintendo's doing a lot of good things with the Wii, but then
4768080	4773160	all the good things end up turning up sour, you know, when you really think about it.
4773160	4778160	The whole having to lock down, you know, region, regioning on, you know, the games and the
4778160	4779160	virtual console.
4779160	4781960	Isn't that going to hurt them in the long run?
4781960	4787160	Well, I agree it sucks and all, but you know, the NES was region locked too.
4787160	4790800	Yeah, but that was easy to get, you know.
4790800	4793000	It wasn't as, that was then.
4793000	4799320	I mean, when you have the PS3 being region free, couldn't they just compete on that?
4799320	4801840	I don't, I got to be honest with you.
4801840	4807060	I know the folks that listen to this show because the way myself, Loki, and Dark Soccer
4807060	4812040	are is that we are focused a lot on import gaming and we really do enjoy a lot of the
4812040	4813680	games that come over here from Japan.
4813680	4817760	So from our perspective, yeah, it's really fucked up that Nintendo's not supporting the
4817760	4818760	region.
4818760	4823360	I mean, if you had, if you had like a single version of a game without having to do any,
4823360	4829760	you know, any, any porting, any extra work and try to localize it to a particular country,
4829760	4833200	you know, rather, you know, rather doing the languages the first time, wouldn't that make
4833200	4835840	more sense than just releasing one copy?
4835840	4839020	Well, that's a lot of work though, because you have to do all those different languages
4839020	4840020	and things.
4840020	4846400	I mean, if you have French for parts of Canada, Japanese, but that's, you know, but just keeping
4846400	4849520	that in the single source.
4849520	4851920	Maybe but, but here's, okay.
4851920	4859920	Here's my other question for you would be then about the Wii, what, what's the, okay,
4859920	4864280	what about the, the greater gamer culture out there besides just us, the rabid, you
4864280	4865280	know, import gamers?
4865280	4867280	Are they going to give a shit?
4867280	4871280	Yeah, casual gamers won't give a crap about, about what we're bitching about.
4871280	4873640	I mean, that's a, that's a fact.
4873640	4879640	Casual gamers just want to play, period, and so what the Wii does is gives them that opportunity
4879640	4883440	to just play, which is basically Nintendo's banking on right now.
4883440	4887780	They're just banking on the, on the casual gamers to, to pretty much, you know, dominate
4887780	4888940	this holiday season.
4888940	4892340	So my question is in the big picture, will it really make a difference that they've region
4892340	4893720	locked out?
4893720	4894720	Not really.
4894720	4899880	It would affect some, but then Nintendo wouldn't care because that, because our, our niche
4899880	4902160	minority is not their bottom line.
4902160	4907520	Their bottom line is about everyone, the casual gamer included.
4907520	4910840	Interesting comment in our chat room, Ari Masin says, I'm a large importer.
4910840	4914320	I might buy two Wiis just to play both Japanese and American games.
4914320	4916400	Well, Nintendo just one off you.
4916400	4919920	Well, that's basically what people did when the PS2 first came out.
4919920	4920920	Yeah, that's what I did.
4920920	4923840	Hey, Sony made it twice off me, so whatever.
4923840	4925800	And you know, who knows?
4925800	4929320	There might be a way to just crack the Wii like they did with the GameCube to play imports.
4929320	4930320	Oh, we'll see.
4930320	4934360	And so you got to get those technologies, you got to give those opportunities time.
4934360	4935360	All right.
4935360	4939120	All right, Zach, who, anything, any of the thoughts for our listeners?
4939120	4944680	Basically New York people, Digital Life this Friday, Saturday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
4944680	4945680	Sunday.
4945680	4949280	Who's, where's a good meetup spot at Digital Life?
4949280	4950880	Basically I'm not really sure.
4950880	4953320	Maybe maybe in the front lobby of the Javits Center.
4953320	4954320	All right.
4954320	4957800	So maybe on the, or maybe inside the DDR machine, maybe in the DDR tournament area.
4957800	4958800	All right.
4958800	4963040	Orange Loungers, Orange Loungers, be at the DDR machine Saturday at noon.
4963040	4964040	Mm-hmm.
4964040	4965520	All right.
4965520	4966520	The OLR meetup.
4966520	4971280	Yes, the OLR meetup right there with the DDR tournament.
4971280	4972280	All right.
4972280	4973280	It's Saturday at noon.
4973280	4974280	All right.
4974280	4975280	Have fun.
4975280	4976280	Be there.
4976280	4977280	Okay.
4977280	4978280	All right.
4978280	4979280	Later, Zachu.
4979280	4980280	Bye.
4980280	4981280	Bye-bye.
4981280	4982280	One more call.
4982280	4983280	Last call.
4983280	4984280	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4984280	4985280	Who's this?
4985280	4986280	It's DMA.
4986280	4987280	How's it going, guys?
4987280	4988280	God damn, you get through every week.
4988280	4989280	You know?
4989280	4990280	All right.
4990280	4991280	Well, what's up, DMN?
4991280	4995520	I'm actually calling with a, well, now having heard that last call, I have something else.
4995520	4999800	But the first thing is a little brief review of Clubhouse Games for the DS.
4999800	5001080	I want Clubhouse Games.
5001080	5003600	I totally forgot about this game until somebody was talking about it in chat earlier.
5003600	5007360	Dude, the only reason I want to get this game is because you can pick the chat over the
5007360	5008360	internet.
5008360	5009360	No, no, you can't.
5009360	5010360	Oh, fuck.
5010360	5011360	That's it.
5011360	5012360	I'm not buying it.
5012360	5014960	Fucking Nintendo, that's what you get.
5014960	5018480	You can pick the chat over local Wi-Fi while you're playing.
5018480	5020760	Well, I can do that already.
5020760	5022600	You can't do pick the chat while you're playing a game, though.
5022600	5023680	I can do it while I'm playing ping-pals.
5023680	5027240	Well, I'm sorry you bought that.
5027240	5028880	No, it was a gift.
5028880	5030680	It was a very nice gift.
5030680	5031680	But fuck that game.
5031680	5032680	Seriously.
5032680	5033680	I'm sorry.
5033680	5034680	I'm sorry that I was bought for you.
5034680	5035680	That's like, no, no, no.
5035680	5037600	I mean, it was a very sweet person that gave it to me.
5037600	5040020	I'm not saying anything negative about the game, but seriously, it was like getting a
5040020	5043760	fruitcake for Christmas, okay?
5043760	5047400	You know grandma loves you, but you got a damn fruitcake.
5047400	5051240	Yeah, well, Clubhouse Games is really cool.
5051240	5055360	What's really awesome about it is with the Wi-Fi mode, you can play all of the multiplayer
5055360	5059800	games online, which is like about 36, I think, when I come to it.
5059800	5061800	Now, see, that's cool to me.
5061800	5066080	Yeah, and it's great because I'm a casual gamer as well as a hardcore gamer.
5066080	5068320	I love playing like checkers, chess, whatever.
5068320	5072160	So this is fun for me because I can play with my friends all around the world, and at the
5072160	5075520	same time, it's games I know how to play.
5075520	5076520	Cool.
5076520	5080400	Now, what other kind of like features does this have kind of souped up with the games?
5080400	5083960	You know, there's like 30 some odd games, which I suppose is a big selling point, but
5083960	5087200	what are some other features that might sell this game to people?
5087200	5091920	The fact that it's under the Touch Generations label, which is Nintendo's label for games
5091920	5094800	anyone can pick up and play.
5094800	5099460	So you could, sorry, lost some thought there.
5099460	5105840	You could pick up anything on this and immediately want to play it, and from what I hear, it
5105840	5106840	might be affordable.
5106840	5110440	I hear it might retail at the very most expensive $29.99.
5110440	5111440	Interesting.
5111440	5113880	Loki, do you know how much that's retailing for?
5113880	5114880	What thing?
5114880	5115880	Clubhouse games?
5115880	5116880	Do you know how much that's going for?
5116880	5119320	Things like, I want to say $19.99 or something.
5119320	5120320	Oh, okay.
5120320	5121320	That'd be nice.
5121320	5122320	That's a really good deal if that's true.
5122320	5124640	I can't remember off the top of my head.
5124640	5126000	If you give me a second, I can check.
5126000	5127800	All right, well, you do that.
5127800	5130160	What else did you want to say, DMN, while he's checking?
5130160	5135480	Now hearing about that whole Wii region lock, it could be very possible that sometime down
5135480	5141800	the road, Nintendo could release a firmware update to eliminate that issue.
5141800	5143240	Why would they do that?
5143240	5145360	I don't know.
5145360	5149360	Perhaps maybe Nintendo will realize the error of their way sometime down the road and be
5149360	5152240	like, oh, hey, these people want to play our Japanese titles.
5152240	5161120	They can't ignore the fact that Owen Don was one of the most imported games of 2006.
5161120	5165240	And they said, okay, fine, we're going to give you Elite Beat Agents.
5165240	5171000	But if there's an Owen Don game coming out for the Wii, I want it, and I don't want to
5171000	5175960	have to buy another Wii or crack my Wii open to play on my American console.
5175960	5179360	I totally understand what you're saying, because it's as cool as Elite Beat Agents might be,
5179360	5180540	it's not Owen Don.
5180540	5187640	It's not the same song list, which in a music game is everything.
5187640	5191840	And that's what Dark Tetsuya agrees in chat right there, but Elite Beat Agents is an entirely
5191840	5192840	different game.
5192840	5196240	Did you find the answer, Logie?
5196240	5197240	Yes I did.
5197240	5198240	What?
5198240	5199240	$29.99.
5199240	5200240	Blast.
5200240	5201240	That's all right.
5201240	5203520	$29 is not a bad price, really, for that many games.
5203520	5206640	But I mean, they're not all shitty clones of each other, right?
5206640	5208640	They're all uniquely different, pretty cool games?
5208640	5213160	Yeah, they're all uniquely different, and I've already played a couple games of Wi-Fi.
5213160	5218720	There is nothing like a good Wi-Fi game of BS, and definitely nothing like a good Wi-Fi
5218720	5219720	game of Speed.
5219720	5220720	If anybody's familiar with that game.
5220720	5223520	I'm totally going to be playing some of our chatters in Speed.
5223520	5225180	I'll buy this game just for that.
5225180	5226860	You could have just released Speed and I'd buy that.
5226860	5227860	That's a great game.
5227860	5228860	All right.
5228860	5232840	Well, I'll be picking up the game, and we'll post on the forums and get an OLR get together
5232840	5234480	on the clubhouse games at some point.
5234480	5235480	All right, cool.
5235480	5236480	All right.
5236480	5237480	DMN, thanks so much for calling in.
5237480	5238480	We appreciate it.
5238480	5239480	All right.
5239480	5240480	Take care.
5240480	5241480	Have a wonderful week.
5241480	5242480	Bye-bye.
5242480	5243480	All right.
5243480	5244480	That's going to do it for the Skyline tonight.
5244480	5245480	Thank you guys so much for calling in.
5245480	5246480	Sorry to those folks who didn't get through.
5246480	5247480	Try again next time.
5247480	5248480	Any last minute stories you want to share, Loki?
5248480	5249480	Of course I do.
5249480	5250480	I know.
5250480	5251480	You always do.
5251480	5252480	Anyways.
5252480	5253480	Some wonderful stuff.
5253480	5254480	Okay.
5254480	5257200	One thing about the Wii, since we were just talking about it.
5257200	5262160	The Miis that you create, actually, they're going to be popping up in different things.
5262160	5266960	For example, in games, you might see the other Miis that you've created in the audience or
5266960	5269120	in the stands for certain games.
5269120	5275120	Also, they will be possibly migrating to other Wii systems, kind of like Animal Crossing.
5275120	5276120	So that's kind of neat.
5276120	5277120	Oh, that's kind of neat.
5277120	5278120	Yeah.
5278120	5280040	So it's not just your face in Wii Sports.
5280040	5281240	It's the tennis wielder.
5281240	5284240	You might start infecting other consoles.
5284240	5285240	That's kind of neat.
5285240	5286240	Exactly.
5286240	5287240	All right.
5287240	5288240	I like that.
5288240	5289240	So that's pretty cool.
5289240	5290240	Some other cool stuff.
5290240	5295680	Rainbow Six Vegas is going to be seeing a demo on Xbox Live on October 23rd.
5295680	5296960	That game looked pretty amazing.
5296960	5299600	So worth checking out.
5299600	5304560	As we mentioned before with GT, that it was going to have a steering wheel attachment
5304560	5305680	for the Wii.
5305680	5310760	Monster 4x4 World Circuit, another Ubisoft racing game, will also have that same steering
5310760	5313360	wheel attachment as well for the Wii.
5313360	5316400	So that's going to be pretty cool.
5316400	5320640	Something that I thought was kind of interesting, well, actually, a few acquisitions took place
5320640	5321640	this week.
5321640	5328080	EA finished their deal to buy DICE, the makers of Battlefield franchise.
5328080	5329520	So that was pretty interesting.
5329520	5334600	And also, Foundation 9 acquired Shiny Entertainment.
5334600	5339140	You might remember them from wonderful games like Earthworm Jim.
5339140	5344560	And then there was a survey that went out for Guitar Hero that mentioned two games that
5344560	5349080	are possibly in the works, Keyboard Hero and Drummer Hero.
5349080	5353920	In no way, I'm sure, ripping off any Konami franchises with those.
5353920	5355800	But interesting nonetheless.
5355800	5359640	Oh yeah, I heard about that survey that went out.
5359640	5361280	I don't know, though.
5361280	5365920	I think people might be reading too much into that whole thing.
5365920	5372240	There was also a really cool product that was released called Connect360 that indexes
5372240	5377880	your iTunes and iPhoto libraries to stream them to the 360, which is interesting.
5377880	5386760	If you want to check that out, it's www.nullriver.com slash index slash products slash Connect360.
5386760	5388680	So go check that out.
5388680	5393480	And then some more adult content that is available out there.
5393480	5400080	For Dead or Alive Extreme 2, you will be getting changing sequences.
5400080	5401080	That's right, the girls will change.
5401080	5405280	Like in Final Fantasy X-2, where they did the little woo!
5405280	5406280	Actually yes.
5406280	5408680	I knew it.
5408680	5409680	It's not like...
5409680	5414840	It says it will be anime-inspired, resembling a transformation sequence you'd find in something
5414840	5416120	like Sailor Moon.
5416120	5420520	Of course, there's going to be some really naughty stuff in there.
5420520	5428200	And then finally, to all-out actual porno, the Whores of Warcraft, a website that's actually
5428200	5435720	released that has Warcraft-themed porn on it, and that's Whores of Warcraft dot com.
5435720	5443360	They have one episode you can purchase right now for $7.95, and it's real people.
5443360	5447480	This isn't Maki-Mai or anything like that, but they actually also have a MySpace community
5447480	5452080	if you want to join that, which is MySpace dot com slash Whores of Warcraft.
5452080	5455560	I should also mention that Orange Lounge Radio has a MySpace community that's more worth
5455560	5456560	your time.
5456560	5457560	MySpace dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5457560	5462360	But they have some chick that looks like she has elf ears, so that's kind of interesting.
5462360	5466800	That's your elf porn going on there.
5466800	5474520	I have received a hot tip from a trusted source that WarioWare for the Wii is going to be
5474520	5478240	bumped up to a launch title, and you will be seeing that very soon.
5478240	5481800	Well good, because I have that pre-ordered, and it was only slated for January.
5481800	5489120	Well, it looks like you may actually get your WarioWare on in November, so take that as
5489120	5490120	you will.
5490120	5495600	I want to see Wii Play come out as the launch title, too.
5495600	5497880	That's not even slated to come out in this country at all, is it?
5497880	5499800	It's coming out in the UK, I mean, come on!
5499800	5505640	How hard would it be to release it here as well, I mean, seriously.
5505640	5507320	That's going to wrap it up for tonight's show.
5507320	5508320	We're done.
5508320	5509520	We're out of here.
5509520	5513080	This is a weird show with just two of us, but we did pretty good getting through all
5513080	5514080	the news.
5514080	5517560	Dark Soccer will be back next week to keep us in line and to read the emails and give
5517560	5522360	you her website of the week, of which there is none this week because she's not here.
5522360	5526800	Next week as well, we'll have more of you guys in our chat room and on the Skype line
5526800	5529040	and more news and hopefully some interviews.
5529040	5531320	We are trying to get some interviews lined up for the rest of the month on through the
5531320	5532320	year.
5532320	5536000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.
5536000	5537000	We appreciate it.
5537000	5538440	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5538440	5540400	Well, Loki, your final thought?
5540400	5545760	My final thought is I have two episodes of my new show done already, both an hour long.
5545760	5546760	Excellent.
5546760	5547760	Yes.
5547760	5550000	Orange House Radio will be participating in November sweeps this year.
5550000	5552480	That's all I can say.
5552480	5558280	My final thought will be, on behalf of Jamie not being here, I will say reject false icons.
5558280	5562960	My other final thought would be how in the hell did six bottles of Aquafina end up over
5562960	5563960	on Extra First's desk?
5563960	5565160	That's kind of scary.
5565160	5566160	They're all half empty.
5566160	5568720	Actually, quite a bit of them are mostly full.
5568720	5569720	What the hell?
5569720	5570720	What the hell is wrong with this picture?
5570720	5571720	Such a waster.
5571720	5572840	Oyster of water.
5572840	5577760	All those countries out there that are dehydrated.
5577760	5579400	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us.
