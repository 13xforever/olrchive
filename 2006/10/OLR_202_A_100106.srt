00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Tonight, October 1, 2006, Microsoft dropped some surprises at X06.

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,200
Other uses for your Microsoft points besides Microsoft Arcade.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:32,560
And will Next Gen Castlevania go back to its roots?

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,680
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
Radio.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,360
We are that podcast dedicated to video gaming and gamer culture and the gamer news that

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,160
you guys really want to know about, at least the stuff we think you want to know about.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm here to help you through that.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
My name is Rob Roberts.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
You might know me as Sky.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Yo, what up?

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
How you doing?

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
I'm a little worn out.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
A little worn out?

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Long day?

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I had a busy weekend.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
I had a busy weekend too.

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
It's been crazy.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Yeah.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,680
One of my really, really, really good friends in the whole wide world had his birthday this

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,880
weekend, so we were running around.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,480
I wanted to go, but I had already made plans to be in the bay since my hubbies at GameStop

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
conference.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
That's okay.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
He was too drunk to remain.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,040
You probably could tell him that you were there and he would remember.

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,080
Oh yeah, I was sitting right next to you.

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Exactly.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
I had a beer.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,200
And just go, you know, you were so drunk.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh my God.

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Exactly.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
All right.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,520
Say hello to the sober for now, Loki.

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
Hello.

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
No, just kidding.

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,360
Tonight is not a drunk episode and we're being very responsible adults tonight, right, Techmaster

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Loki?

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Sure.

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
All right.

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,840
Maybe he is drunk and he just didn't say anything.

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
I don't know.

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
All right.

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,440
Well, we like to always start it off talking about our gaming weeks, so let's get right

46
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
into it.

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Let's cut the crap and talk games.

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,480
Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week?

49
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,080
I played DDR on Tuesday, just, you know, extreme.

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,440
I wanted to go play Supernova, but I don't know how to really get to anywhere in Rockland,

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,760
so I just sort of went to Arviggle for the first time in like a year and there was...

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,600
We decided to name the Flock of Emo that came in.

53
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
There was...

54
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Flock of Emo.

55
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Was that an 80s band?

56
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
No, that was a Flock of Seagulls.

57
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh yes.

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
All right.

59
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Flock of Emo is trademarked Megsy.

60
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,480
So one of them was the definite emo kid.

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,840
There was the punk girl.

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,600
There was the token normal friend, you know, the kind of nerdy person.

63
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Were they all playing DDR?

64
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
They were all playing DDR.

65
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Oh wow.

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:37,880
And so I was there with my friend Heather, who's on my LiveJournal, and we had fun.

67
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,640
Speaking of emo, meeting people from LiveJournal, huh?

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,200
I had been friends with her through LiveJournal for I guess a year or so, and she's friends

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
with my cousins-in-law.

70
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,200
She actually hangs out with them regularly, so we just figured let's finally just go hang

71
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
out.

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
So we did.

73
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Cool.

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,820
And then we...

75
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
I went to...

76
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Oh crap.

77
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,840
I lost my chair, I thought.

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay.

79
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
My friend Tiara.

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
You all know Tiara, my sauce.

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,120
She introduced me to a game called Pirate King Online that's a new MMO.

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,880
Right now it's in open beta, and it's cute, and you go around killing things and questing

83
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,560
and getting clothes and making pie.

84
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
Oh, that's a different game.

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm sorry, I was familiar with the other Pirate King, which game I participate on a regular

86
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
basis.

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,840
Is that like a website where you download pirated files or something?

88
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
No, I just...

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,920
Oh, you know, I am the Pirate King.

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:50,320
Anyway, and then I spent this entire weekend in the Bay Area with, everyone knows Kristen

91
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
by now.

92
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, she's been on a couple times.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah, she was too tired to come on the show today.

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,400
We went to the Castro Street Fair, and it was just so busy and so many people that it

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,160
was just like, I'm tired, I'm tired too, let's go get some hot chocolate, okay?

96
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,560
So I really didn't play anything else.

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,840
Hmm, interesting.

98
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,240
I played quite a bit this week, and nothing I really, well, there was a bunch of stuff

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,040
I had lined up to play, but I never got around to.

100
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,200
You know, the whole hooking up the PlayStation 2 again thing.

101
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,800
I did get to play, well first off, my camera, I replaced the vision camera, and yes it was

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,720
defective, got the new one, works great.

103
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,040
So now do you feel bad about bashing the camera last week?

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,760
No, I don't, but it's good when it works.

105
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,760
I mean, so now that it's completely clear, I have a personalized picture up, I played

106
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,400
UNO, and I played UNO with the camera, and it's very, I don't know, it can be boring

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
and I guess weird.

108
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,160
All right, how many people did you show your ass to?

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,720
I didn't show my ass to anybody, but someone had their camera pointed towards the ceiling,

110
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
they're all, oh yeah, I forgot to unplug it, it had fallen behind like the TV or something,

111
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,560
and then like just another person that was just sitting there, and then just, you know,

112
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
someone else.

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,360
And you know what sucked, is we only had like three people I think, and the computer player

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
just kicked all of our asses, so that kind of sucked.

115
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,840
I did win one game though.

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Good job.

117
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,000
And then, what else did I play, I played Doom, and Doom was kind of fun, and then Rob dragged

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,920
me into a multiplayer game, and the multiplayer game was so laggy as fucking hell.

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,480
But I don't know, I haven't played any other additional multiplayer games other than that,

120
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,480
so I couldn't really say if that's like all the other games.

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,680
It seems, I seem to have this kind of bad track record with lagging multiplayer games

122
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,760
just from all the, you know, my first Saints Row game was crap, you know, multiplayer wise

123
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,800
was all laggy, and then Doom was all laggy.

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,120
So I don't know, it looks fun, so I'll probably try that some more a little bit later.

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,640
And then of course Nellie's been playing a lot of Zuma, and I've been playing, you know,

126
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,520
quite a bit of Zuma, and we're pretty far in that.

127
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,160
We actually have achievements, we got the one for 24 hours, which is pretty interesting.

128
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
That's kind of sad.

129
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,400
But, she plays a lot, okay.

130
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Seriously, she's been playing 360 more than I have, which is kind of interesting.

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,840
Saints Row wise, I actually have been playing through Saints Row, it's pretty fun, and I

132
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,560
tried cheating this week, ooh, food.

133
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,860
But it didn't work like I wanted it to, because you see, you get points, or you get money

134
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,120
accrued to you as time passes in game, and so I was just going to leave the game on and

135
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,260
have my character walk around in circles with the analog stick, you know.

136
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,800
But somehow I knew that I was doing that, and so I didn't get that much money, it just

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
wasn't coming as fast as I thought it would.

138
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,040
Either way, I found out robbing a bunch of stores in a row is a lot better than just

139
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,880
standing there waiting for time to pass.

140
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm going to our always present fourth guest that we have here on Orange Launch Radio,

141
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,720
the chat room over at orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat, and I noticed that Jeremy Todd

142
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,240
says, OMG, Matt is turning Nellie into a gamer.

143
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,840
She loves her PopCap games, and God forbid they release Bejeweled 3, I'll never see the

144
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
360 again.

145
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,200
That is a vicious lie!

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I will never be a gamer, ever!

147
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,640
I will sell my baby before I do that.

148
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,240
Remind me to shut the door when we tape next time.

149
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,120
No, I did play one other thing.

150
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,240
I got the beta, which is funny because I got this in the mail.

151
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,760
I got the beta for Killzone Liberation, and I don't like it.

152
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,080
I don't like what they're doing with the PSP as far as taking these really good first person

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,680
shooters and then all of a sudden, look, now it's an isometric 3D third person shooter

155
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,120
game.

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,400
It's just not as cool, I'm sorry.

157
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,320
50 Cent Bulletproof sucked, and Killzone, it's just not my type of game, that style.

158
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,000
I would rather it be a first person shooter, like Full Auto 2, well, Full Auto 2 is going

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,760
to be probably a first person camera thing, which is coming out on the PSP later on March.

160
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,800
No one's mentioned that yet, no magazines at least, because you know, once it hits the

161
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,440
magazine, then it'll be fact.

162
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,040
We'll get to that later in the show, yes.

163
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Save your angst, please.

164
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Is that it?

165
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,960
Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, just stop mentioning it, we know you played

166
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,720
the damn thing, all your work breaks, just get over it.

167
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,100
We keep complaining about it, and we're like, we gotta switch to another game, but I'm confident

168
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,680
that we'll move on to Vice City Stories and hopefully a multiple percenter.

169
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,760
I don't get you, you're the only gamer I know that'll be like, God, I hate this game and

170
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't stop playing.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,480
I'm addicted, what can I say?

172
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,440
My Gaming Week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, although I did play Doom, and

173
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Doom, you know, it's interesting, because I don't want to like Doom because of the fact

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,360
it's 800 points, because of the fact that the game is basically free on the PC, I mean,

175
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,920
they released the source code some time ago, and for the fact that really, you can play

176
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,880
Doom on the Xbox 360 without downloading it for Marketplace.

177
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
Just get a copy of Doom 3 Collector's Edition, because the Doom 3 Collector's Edition had

178
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,140
Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 as playable games in it.

179
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,120
So really the only thing that this new Doom adds is the Xbox Live component, and they,

180
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,480
you know, touch some things up.

181
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,360
They say the graphics are improved, but, you know, come on, it's still the pixelated wonder

182
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,320
we all remember from the old PC days.

183
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,760
But that being said, I do love Doom.

184
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,520
I do love me some Doom, an awful lot.

185
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Yes, Jamie?

186
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,600
It just has ultra-violence and hurt me plenty, and I love the titles of the difficulty levels.

187
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes, I mean, it still has all that wonder that made it such a great game in the 90s,

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,720
and I'll tell you what, there really is something to be said, because I used to play this game

189
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,040
on my slow-ass 486 computer, and I would have to shrink the window down to get a decent

190
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
frame rate.

191
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,240
You know, I'm squinting on this little 15-inch monitor to play Doom, and now I'm playing

192
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,120
it on my, like, my new TV that's, like, 32-inch, you know, high def.

193
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,120
I know some of you guys have bigger TVs, but just bear with me here.

194
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,880
You know, that big, huge screen and high def, it's, there's something to be said about that.

195
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,320
The game actually scared me today.

196
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
I turned around, and one of those little imp things that looks like that creature from

197
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,840
Signs that ran by, forget it, but that thing scared the hell out of me, and I'm like, ah,

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
I shouldn't get scared at this.

199
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,520
These things are pixelated and not supposed to freak me out, but it did, and so I think

200
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,800
there's still something to be said about the fact that Doom still has that, you know, charm

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
and has lasted all these years.

202
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,720
Xbox Live is hit and miss.

203
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,520
Sometimes I get into a quick match game, and I've played some death match, and it works

204
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,880
pretty well, but, like, I played a game with a listener and Loki, and it was laggy as hell,

205
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,400
so I don't know if one of us just had a bad connection or what was going on, but that

206
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,120
kind of made me sad, but, you know, I don't know.

207
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,720
If Xbox Live Play is something that interests you, if having this game on your TV set is

208
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,360
something that interests you, then it's a decent buy, and you want to get achievement

209
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,520
points or whatever, then cool, but otherwise, you know, maybe you ought to just download

210
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,020
the one that's on the computer if you just want to play Doom and you don't really care

211
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,480
about where you do it.

212
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
Do the cheats work?

213
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
I don't know.

214
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
I haven't plugged in my keyboard.

215
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
No.

216
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Did you?

217
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
It doesn't work?

218
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
No, I read it somewhere, though.

219
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Lame.

220
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
I'd have to try it out for myself, though, because, what was it?

221
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,000
IDDQD was god mode, and IDNRA, no, that was, NRA was hexen.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,440
So somebody tried plugging in the keyboard and doing it because we thought about it,

223
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,640
we just, oh, that sucks.

224
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,880
Can you use the keyboard as a controller?

225
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
I don't know.

226
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
That I have to try.

227
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I wonder if the chatroom knows the answer.

228
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm sorry, I can't play Doom with a controller.

229
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,920
No, it actually really works for me.

230
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,120
I can move around in ways I couldn't before with the keyboard.

231
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,360
The keyboard, if you know your side step toggles and everything, it shouldn't be a problem.

232
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
There will be people that are keyboard for life.

233
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,040
A lot of PC gamers, if they're mostly the type that games on PC exclusively, they're

234
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,080
going to probably be keyboard for life, but they've gotten used to that.

235
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,400
I still haven't really, I don't know.

236
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,560
I can do it in World of Warcraft, but I can't really do it in Doom as well.

237
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,760
The other kid was IDBFG, I think.

238
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Sorry.

239
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,800
Yeah, that's, I forgot how much I hate the BFG in multiplayer.

240
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,400
I really, really hate the BFG in multiplayer.

241
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,640
Thank you to, thanks to Jaded2006's IDDQD, IDKFA was the one I was trying to think of,

242
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,600
IDKLAV, and IDBFG will give you the BFG.

243
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Nice.

244
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,400
Now our whole chatroom is going off.

245
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
My game was hexen.

246
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I was really.

247
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,520
Now that I would like to see come out on the Marketplace.

248
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,240
If you type in Satan, you get god mode.

249
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,040
Rise of the Triad.

250
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,840
DMN will agree with you.

251
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,000
And also, I was really hoping they'd release Duke Nukem 3D.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I wish.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I really hope that happens.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,100
I want someone to do a Quake hack and turn it into Silent Hill.

255
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,800
You know, that's too bad that we can't load those custom-made Doom WAD files on the Xbox

256
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Live Marketplace.

257
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Wouldn't that be cool, like if they released some of the best ones, like just add-ons in

258
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
the marketplace?

259
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,680
I had Gachamon Doom, and I would play the hell out of that.

260
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Uber nerd.

261
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
I love Gachamon.

262
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
I love Uber nerd.

263
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,360
We had, my favorite one was Killing Barney, where Barney was the final boss.

264
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
I remember that one.

265
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Was that a Wolfenstein hack?

266
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
No, they had both.

267
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
All right.

268
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
There's also a Quake one too.

269
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,120
All right, anyway, moving on from Doom, I can talk about DDR Supernova now.

270
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,680
DDR Supernova is great, I mean, if you're into DDR, I don't think there's anything new

271
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,880
here that's going to win somebody who hasn't really played DDR before into this game, although

272
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,120
you know, just like every other DDR before it, it has beginner modes and things you can

273
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
learn on.

274
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,040
Konami took some risks with the song list, but I think they paid off.

275
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,280
I rather enjoy the song list, and when I say they took risks, I mean they didn't do a carbon

276
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,640
copy of the arcade machine, which I think a lot of people were expecting, but I found

277
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,520
some of the new steps and the new songs to be quite pleasant.

278
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,000
I did find it really interesting that they had some of the songs that were just now put

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,040
into the arcade mix, well it was like Fascination, the Eternal Love thing, which to be honest,

280
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,880
that was about as interesting to me as Paranoia Survivor and Paranoia Survivor Max.

281
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,860
You know what, a lot of love out there though for Fascination, the Eternal Love mix, a lot

282
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,720
of love out there on the forums for it, so you have your opinion, they have theirs.

283
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,520
As far as the rest of the game, it's obvious that Konami has listened to a lot of the bitches

284
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,320
that people had about EX2, especially when it came to Dance Master mode, because this

285
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,480
new Stellar Magic mode is kind of neat.

286
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,600
It's a little bit different.

287
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,360
I wouldn't say it's necessarily easier, but it does seem like you can get your unlocks

288
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,440
a little bit easier than you could previously, except the uber hard stuff, but the uber hard

289
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,040
stuff is supposed to be uber hard to get, so you just have to work for it.

290
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,600
Otherwise I rather like the game, I would recommend it certainly to any DDR fan and

291
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,840
folks that are into music games at all, I think it is one of the better DDR mixes they

292
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,800
have released on PlayStation 2.

293
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,760
I don't know, I still have a place in my heart for Max 2 though, so I don't know if I could

294
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,240
call it the best, but it's definitely one of my favorites, and certainly much better

295
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,240
than like Max 1 and Extreme War, it's certainly on the upper end of PlayStation 2 DDR mixes,

296
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,800
so I do recommend it for DDR fans, and if you hate DDR, well then you're probably going

297
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,680
to hate Supernova, so there's nothing new for you here, move along.

298
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,360
Other than that, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff, I was playing 99 Nights

299
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,640
for a little bit, I was watching my friend play Enchanted Arms, because I haven't been

300
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,160
playing it a lot, but I've been watching my friend play through that while I play World

301
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,400
of Warcraft on the Mac, and I went back to Beatmania 2DX, because Loki gave me that second

302
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,040
controller, so I was like, ooh, I can play doubles now!

303
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,560
I really suck at doubles, because I've lost a lot of my 2DX skill in general, like I'm

304
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,160
just barely passing some sevens, I used to be able to get some of the flashing sevens

305
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,360
out and things, but I'm working my way up on doubles, doubles is fun, it's kind of renewing

306
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
my interest in 2DX all over again, so I'll have to get some of the newer styles.

307
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
The newest one I have is Night Style, isn't that sad?

308
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,680
There's been like 10th, 11th, and Happy Sky, or 10th Red and Happy Sky on the way.

309
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,120
I've played the Pirate King game, and I've gotten Red, and I'm actually looking at more

310
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,280
of the Guitar Freaks games like V, and the Silver Collection, or whatever it is, some

311
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,520
import one.

312
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,240
But next week though, I was hoping to have a review for it this week, Earth Defense Force

313
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,120
2 is the game I'm going to be playing, which for those who may have seen some of the stuff

314
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,080
coming from Tokyo Game Show, Earth Defense Force 3 was the first Simple 2000 game that's

315
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,760
going to be on the Xbox 360, so I've got to play the one before it, because that one's

316
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,040
not out yet.

317
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,040
I have to talk about as well some of the Xbox 360 bringing it home demos and trailers that

318
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,360
I downloaded.

319
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,160
I played the Fusion Frenzy 2 demo, which you gave a negative review on last week's show.

320
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,320
I didn't think it was that bad, I just think the demo's pretty quick.

321
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,280
There's really only three mini games to play, but the demo's not supposed to give away the

322
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,560
whole game, so I thought it was presented well and might make a decent game.

323
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,200
Maybe in a party game environment that'd be cool, but playing single player sucks.

324
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Exactly, single player sucks, but Mario Party single player sucks too.

325
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So I think Fusion Frenzy 2 has potential to be pretty good, so the demo is kind of one

326
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
of those wait and see things.

327
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm going to wait and see how much the full version costs and make a decision from there.

328
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,920
I did see a demo from Tokyo Game Show of a game I want to play.

329
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
What's that?

330
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Project Silphied.

331
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Mmm.

332
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
It's pretty...

333
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,040
I also got to see the demo for, what was it, White Knight for PS3, but it actually could

334
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,600
convince me to buy one.

335
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Really?

336
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,720
$49.99 is what Fusion Frenzy, let's see, that's a little high for me.

337
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
I don't know.

338
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,080
I don't know enough party game things at the house to justify that.

339
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,760
It's kind of one of those things maybe after Christmas it'll drop to $29.39.

340
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,160
It's really bad timing too because it's coming out, what, a couple weeks before the Wii?

341
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,760
That thing's spring party game.

342
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Yeah, I don't know.

343
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
I don't know about Fusion Frenzy.

344
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,960
I'll tell you this, I definitely know about this one though and I'm sorry because it's

345
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,640
probably going to make some people cry, but the Sonic the Hedgehog demo came out on 360.

346
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
It's awful.

347
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
I told you all!

348
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
It's absolutely horrible.

349
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
Didn't I tell everybody?

350
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Well, yeah, I played the one on PlayStation 3 and that was god-awful.

351
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I played the Xbox.

352
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,240
They had it out on the floor at E3.

353
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,760
See, I didn't bother to play the Xbox 360 one at that time because I hated the PS3 one.

354
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,240
I hunted it down just to see if it was going to break my heart any less.

355
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,400
And it's pretty much the same demo they had at E3, by the way, which is not in the marketplace

356
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
now.

357
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
The control was like, I love my Dreamcast one.

358
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm going to go play it as soon as I get home to cleanse my heart.

359
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,600
I can't explain why Sonic the Hedgehog has just gone so awful with this new one.

360
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,720
Somebody pointed out to me, I want to say it was in an email or something, I think it

361
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,960
was Rob sent me this, our friend on the East Coast, Rob, I want to say something that's

362
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,920
an email, something about, you know, the test drive unlimited demo wasn't that hot either

363
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,760
and the final game was pretty decent, but I don't know.

364
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,440
I don't know if there's much that can save this Sonic.

365
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,040
I mean, the controls are awful.

366
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,800
Trying to manipulate Sonic was just bad.

367
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,480
Where did Sonic go wrong?

368
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,360
Because Sonic hasn't been this bad in 3D before, because I remember the last one they had on

369
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,080
GameCube wasn't that bad.

370
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,400
It was even okay on, do you remember the Sonic collection that came out on the Saturn, had

371
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,600
the 3D running around the world bit in it?

372
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,240
That was better control than...

373
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
It's awful.

374
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,480
You have to download this just to see how far downhill the series has gone.

375
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
It's kind of sad.

376
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,520
It almost feels like they tried to retool the engine or something, but...

377
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,760
They're just trying to figure out, you know, how they can, because Sonic is just, you know,

378
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,440
it's been the same game all the time, they're trying to really, trying to re-jump, you know,

379
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,240
jubilize the whole franchise, because you had Shadow the Hedgehog, which they were trying

380
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,880
to go a different way with it, and it sucked.

381
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,360
It sold horribly.

382
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,840
And then you have Sonic Riders, which, you know, it's a pretty fun racing game, but that

383
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,400
one actually did pretty well.

384
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,320
Now Sonic the Hedgehog, the problem is, I think now you've got, where it's trying, I

385
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,280
don't even know what the, it's like, not even close to what the original Sonic the Hedgehog

386
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
games were.

387
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,400
I mean, as far as the storyline and everything, now you're trying to like, throw in elements

388
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,800
almost like a Final Fantasy or something like that?

389
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I don't know.

390
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,080
And then, you know, all these new characters with each game and stuff, it's just kind of

391
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
crazy.

392
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,000
Plus, now that the systems are even faster and they can crunch the graphics even faster,

393
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,100
so Sonic is even faster.

394
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,440
But the problem is, he doesn't control any better, so you have the same kind of control

395
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,040
and response time as you did on the Sonic games that were slower, now that the thing

396
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,640
is like, lightning fast, it's really hard to control.

397
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,080
I'm going to the chat room and reading some of the comments here on Sonic demo.

398
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,040
Footy Monster says, Wanna save Sonic?

399
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,120
Go back to Sonic Adventure 2.

400
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,020
Funny Dale says, Well, you know, the last few Sonic games sucked ass as well.

401
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,720
You know, not this bad though.

402
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,200
I mean, nothing to me has matched the greatness of the old Genesis ones, Sonic 1, 2, and 3,

403
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,720
and Sonic Spinball, of course.

404
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,520
Nothing has really matched that for me, but like, even the last few ones, whereas they

405
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,160
weren't that good, they weren't this bad.

406
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,320
Sonic Adventure is probably about the, I'd have to say the pinnacle of the whole 3D tribe.

407
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,920
And you know, I feel bad because I don't want to review a game based off the demo, but the

408
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,240
reality is, if you're going to put this demo on Marketplace so people can sample the game,

409
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
people are going to make decisions about the game based off this demo.

410
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,840
And I was excited about Sonic the Hedgehog for Next Gen, but now I am absolutely not.

411
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,000
You were forgotten, by the way.

412
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Sonic CD.

413
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,880
Well, it's been like four months since the E3 demo came out, and it hasn't really improved

414
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,320
since then, so that kind of, either a couple things happened, one, they just didn't have

415
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,600
time to make a new demo, so they just put out the E3 demo, or two, the game hasn't really

416
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,080
improved since then.

417
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,880
All right, well if you're a fan of the new Sonic game, maybe there's something about

418
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
it we're missing.

419
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
We'd love to hear from you.

420
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

421
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,440
We're always willing to hear some difference of opinions.

422
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,200
We might say you're wrong, wrong, wrong, but no, we'll definitely read your emails on them.

423
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Now, Jamie, did you see SmackDown vs. RIO 7?

424
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,920
I actually found the story on that that we're going to be discussing.

425
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Oh, cool.

426
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,320
Well, I guess we'll get into the news since we're starting to touch on some of the things

427
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,320
we wanted to talk about tonight, and the first thing in tonight's gaming news is, of course,

428
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,000
as we talked about in our gaming weeks, Doom came out on Xbox Live.

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,600
What was somewhat interesting about the way Doom came out on Xbox Live is that it was

430
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,120
very stealth.

431
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,880
Microsoft had said that there was a secret project they were working on, and a really

432
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,440
big series was coming to Xbox Live, and some other folks had speculated that the series

433
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,000
was Lode Runner.

434
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,560
You remember the old school game Lode Runner?

435
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,840
I remember it on Commodore 64, but it was on a bunch of old school platforms, and a

436
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,720
lot of people were convinced that was it.

437
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Well, it turns out that's not it, at least right now.

438
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I mean, who's to say?

439
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
That could come out in the future.

440
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,560
It looks like Doom was the secret game that Microsoft was hinting at, and they did one

441
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,000
of those things where they came out and said, Doom is coming out on Xbox Live Marketplace

442
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
right now.

443
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,960
Go download it, and it really caught a lot of people off guard.

444
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,840
I think some websites that morning caught wind of what was going on.

445
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Probably somebody broke the embargo that Microsoft had no doubt placed, but for all realistic

446
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,640
purposes, a less than 24-hour leak is really not bad in this day and age, so they really

447
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
kept a lid on it.

448
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,080
Yeah, a certain website we don't like to talk about broke the embargo.

449
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,680
Oh, well, whatever.

450
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Good for them.

451
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,680
So anyway, of course, Doom Live supports multiplayer on one screen or on multiple screens via Xbox

452
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,760
Live.

453
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,960
It is Doom 1, not Doom 2, and some people would say Doom 2 is the superior game, but

454
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
who knows?

455
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,620
If this is out now and does well, I'd say Doom 2 is just a matter of time.

456
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,240
But as a reminder, if you have the Doom 3 Collector's Edition, you already can play

457
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,760
Doom on the Xbox 360, but of course with this, you get achievements, slightly improved graphics,

458
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
and the Xbox Live play.

459
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,480
Next, we'll see Quake 2, because that was on Quake 4, except it had achievements, but

460
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,840
you didn't get any points for it.

461
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,300
How about Quake 1 with the original Trent Reznor music?

462
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
That would be kind of fun.

463
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,000
That would be really fun.

464
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,920
I was also surprised that Doom 1 was only 22 megabytes to download, but then again,

465
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,400
I guess that's probably how big it was back then.

466
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,280
Back then, my hard drive was only like 100 megabytes, so it was a huge game at the time.

467
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,720
So you know, it's just kind of interesting how far technology has come in the past.

468
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,320
I remember spanning floppies with that thing.

469
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Yeah.

470
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
So we'll see.

471
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,160
Maybe some future ID software games coming next.

472
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Who knows?

473
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
We'll see.

474
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:48,900
Well, as far as things that we need to see about, our dear, dear director friend Peter

475
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:58,160
Jackson has decided that he's got his interest stuck in the Xbox 360 as a new medium for

476
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
storytelling.

477
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,140
And he said that his team at Wingnut Studios is working with Microsoft to co-design and

478
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:13,120
co-produce an original chapter in the Halo stories with Bungie.

479
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,900
They haven't named it or anything yet, but the quote says here, to captivate a new audience

480
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,600
that has yet to discover the power of interactive entertainment, Microsoft has built an amazing

481
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,040
living canvas with Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, which allows the storytellers of our time

482
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,040
to express themselves in a new medium.

483
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,480
I think that's pretty neat.

484
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,000
It's good that big names are starting to recognize exactly just the basically limitless freedom

485
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,600
that a video game will give them in terms of creativity.

486
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
I think it's kind of interesting.

487
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,360
I can't claim to be the world's hugest fan of Lord of the Rings.

488
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
Don't get me wrong.

489
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,600
I thought the movies were good, but I think this is really neat and it sort of to me legitimizes

490
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
gaming in a way.

491
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,160
I mean, here you have this Oscar-winning director coming over and saying, hey, I'm going to

492
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,080
make a game.

493
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,040
It's a little different than previous attempts to kind of bring Hollywood into games a little

494
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
more.

495
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Does anyone remember Apocalyptico?

496
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Was that the name of the game?

497
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
No, that's that movie.

498
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,280
Apocalyptico is a string quartet.

499
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,480
Sorry, I'm thinking of the Mel Gibson movie.

500
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,160
No, there was a game on PS1 with Bruce Willis.

501
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Was it Apocalypse?

502
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,200
I think it was Apocalypse.

503
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,680
Something like that.

504
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,040
That game was not so hot.

505
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,280
Well, the movie was not so hot.

506
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
It wasn't based on a movie.

507
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Wasn't it?

508
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I don't think so.

509
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
No, it wasn't.

510
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Wasn't Bruce Willis in a movie called Apocalypse?

511
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
I don't know.

512
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,040
It was where they had to go drill a hole in the meteor?

513
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,160
No, you're thinking of Armageddon.

514
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Armageddon.

515
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
Same difference.

516
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Oh, my God.

517
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,360
No, this is different.

518
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
This was like a...

519
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
I don't know, but anyway.

520
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Just to expand...

521
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Oh, sorry.

522
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Go ahead.

523
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
There was a little bit more, yeah.

524
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,120
Just to expand, Wingnut Studios, as I referred to earlier, is Peter Jackson's new entertainment

525
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,400
studio that has his movie team and Microsoft's gaming division working together.

526
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,720
I thought that was pretty cool, too.

527
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240
A comment from our chat room here.

528
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,000
Jeremy Todd 1 says, Didn't Peter Jackson help in making the King Kong game?

529
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,280
That game wasn't that bad.

530
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,680
Peter Jackson is probably my favorite movie director.

531
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,880
I haven't played the King Kong game.

532
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,920
I do believe he had a hand in it, actually.

533
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,000
Well, he probably had to give some type of approval to it because it is his movie and

534
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,520
it had his name in the title, so...

535
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,520
Yeah, but I don't know if he actually worked on the game.

536
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,480
I doubt it was that same level of involvement that he's going to have with this Halo project.

537
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,160
I have this theory that he probably saw it in progress, was really inspired, and said,

538
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,120
hey, I want to be a part of something else.

539
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
That's a distinct possibility.

540
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Yeah.

541
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,440
I mean, that's how half of anybody really gets into anything is they have to be introduced

542
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,920
to it first, right?

543
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Mm-hmm.

544
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,840
Well, some other cool stuff came out about the Halo franchise during X06.

545
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,920
Unfortunately, nothing about Halo 3 because they said, later on this year, you'll hear

546
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,480
something, you know, which will probably be even timed with the PlayStation 3 launch or

547
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
something like that.

548
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,680
But anyways, one very interesting thing, which kind of ties in with the whole story we had

549
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:05,040
last week about the real-time strategy Halo mod that was coming out and how it had been

550
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,960
cancelled and basically pulled by Microsoft, and Bungie said, hey, stop making this.

551
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Well...

552
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Cease and Desist.

553
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Yes.

554
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,560
Wonderful Cease and Desist.

555
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,240
Well, it comes, you know, it came out that they're actually making a Halo RTS type of

556
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,960
game called Halo Wars.

557
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,040
It's being put together by Ensemble Studios and Bungie.

558
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,740
Ensemble, you might remember, did the Age of Empires series.

559
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,280
So it should be pretty cool looking and kind of by the looks of the trailer that also hit

560
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,640
the Xbox Live Marketplace, it looks very Starcraft-ish.

561
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,440
So it should fill that void a little bit, at least.

562
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,520
That'll be if I want to play on live, I bet.

563
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Yeah.

564
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
That'd be hugely popular.

565
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
I think so.

566
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,920
I think they're trying to almost grab the same audience of Starcraft with this.

567
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,640
Now, I have a question for you guys.

568
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,060
Do you think that this could be, you know, with this Peter Jackson project and Halo Wars

569
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,960
and Halo 3 on the horizon, is this too much Halo?

570
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,520
Are we headed for an oversaturation of Halo in the market?

571
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
No.

572
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
No.

573
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,680
Because the timeframe that these games are coming out with, this, you know, one that

574
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,660
Peter Jackson's probably working on, probably won't even see it next year, if you know anything.

575
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,040
So you have like Halo 3 coming out, probably then Halo Wars coming out a little bit later

576
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,120
on, maybe early 2008 or something, and then this Peter Jackson one coming out at the end

577
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,940
of 2008 or 2009.

578
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,980
Do you think, and this is just a thought that just occurred to me, because remember when

579
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,560
you gave us that huge thing, that list in episode 198 when you went to the, you know,

580
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,540
they had the sales people come to your work and everything, one of the things you said

581
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,520
is that Halo 3, surprise, surprise, is coming out in April or May, right?

582
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
And a lot of March or April.

583
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I'm sorry, March or April.

584
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,160
A lot of people are still very skeptical about that release, but could this be now that we

585
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,480
know that there's another Halo project being worked on?

586
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,200
Because everybody was saying, oh, Halo 3's got to be Christmas, Halo 3's got to be Christmas.

587
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,760
Is it possible that now Halo Wars is their Christmas title, and Halo 3 is indeed going

588
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,360
to make the March or April release?

589
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
It's possible.

590
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Speculation.

591
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
I don't know.

592
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,960
Did you see the story this week about, what was it, amazon.com had Halo 3 pre-orders and

593
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,680
the release date was March 31st, which I thought was interesting, but, you know, who knows.

594
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
We'll see what happens.

595
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,740
Now, again, and I hate reading from the same person consistently, but everybody else is

596
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,320
doing flooding in our chat room right now, Jeremy Tom 1 says, Bungie is turning into

597
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
EA.

598
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,840
They are starting to put new Halo games out every year and seriously milking the franchise.

599
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Wrong.

600
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,800
I don't think any Halo 06 or Halo 07 are actually mixing things up instead of just updating

601
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
roster.

602
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,320
I don't really agree with the comments to an extent either.

603
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,680
I don't think they're necessarily milking the franchise.

604
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,360
If the games are good, the games are good, no matter what they're based on.

605
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,520
If we see Halo Party or something like that, then yeah, okay, there's a problem, but I

606
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,240
think right now we're pretty fine with the amount of Halo content that's out there.

607
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,040
When you think about it, what, there's been like two games so far and now a possible third

608
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,040
and then we're adding a couple more to the franchise, that's not really overkill yet.

609
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,560
It's not like Final Fantasy or Mario or anything like that.

610
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,960
That's true and Tweak says every year, there's two.

611
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,080
It's not like there's a lot on the horizon.

612
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,480
You're right, it's not something like Final Fantasy where you have the game and now they're

613
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,160
doing what, like three different spin-offs of Final Fantasy XII and XIII and then you

614
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,320
got the tactical games and the Crystal Chronicles games, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing

615
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,400
because most of those Final Fantasy games have been pretty darn good games, so it's

616
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
not necessarily a bad thing.

617
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,280
As long as they keep the quality up, that's all that matters.

618
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,400
In fact, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the few tactical games that held my attention,

619
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,200
I'm just not really into tactical games usually.

620
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,240
Why hasn't there been a new Final Fantasy Tactics?

621
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,080
Because Square Enix has bastard people working for them.

622
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,720
Just kidding, just kidding.

623
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,640
Alright, anyway, another news that came out of X06, it's of note, no pun intended, Guitar

624
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,400
Hero 2 has finally been confirmed for the Xbox 360.

625
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,920
We've been speculating this for weeks and weeks, so this really shouldn't be big news,

626
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,160
but it was confirmed officially.

627
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,600
There's a new controller coming out as well.

628
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,360
Despite news reports that were based off some pictures that were taken at X06, the controller

629
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,400
is not wireless.

630
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,800
There's no word yet if the controller will be wireless or not, if there will be a wireless

631
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
version.

632
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,320
I kind of hope there's not.

633
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,140
If there is, I hope they offer a wired version still, because wireless means more money,

634
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,560
and the last thing I want to have to spend on Guitar Hero is more money.

635
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,280
It's not, and that's because it's a requirement that they have for their third party peripheral

636
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,200
makers that it has to be wired, which is weird because I thought that they had wireless controllers

637
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,540
made by like Mad Cats and stuff, but I guess when it comes down to these weird guitar controllers

638
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,760
or dance pads that come, it's got to be wired, so I don't know.

639
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,560
Also with it being a music game and stuff, you probably don't want wireless even though

640
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,280
granted, Microsoft may be able to pull off the wireless controllers without lag, but

641
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,660
I don't think third parties can, so.

642
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,120
I have to be honest, and I don't know how you guys feel about this, but now that I know

643
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,400
this news, I don't really want to pick up Guitar Hero on PS2 when it comes out.

644
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,120
I'm going to wait for the 360 one.

645
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
That's kind of sad.

646
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,040
Because if it's going to have the microtransactions and the next gen graphics, and I've pretty

647
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,340
much been starting to play Xbox 360 more and more, and I know I'll be playing Wii more and

648
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,800
more when that comes out, and eventually when I finally decide to buy one, PlayStation 3,

649
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,920
you know, I'll kind of be phasing out the old gen games, I don't know if I really want

650
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,160
to pick up Guitar Hero 2 on PS2.

651
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
I don't know.

652
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Do you guys feel similar?

653
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,600
I would have personally have announced this at the end of the year instead of...

654
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,040
And then make us feel really screwed.

655
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
That would have been great.

656
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,520
It's a way to make more money.

657
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Exactly.

658
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
I guess that's true.

659
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Jamie, what do you think?

660
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
I know you're a Guitar Hero fan.

661
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Are you going to purchase the one on PlayStation 2?

662
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,400
Are you going to hold out for this one or what?

663
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,240
Why don't I just get them both?

664
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
I forgot.

665
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
You're a whore for everything.

666
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Gaming.

667
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Gaming.

668
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,880
I don't see where the debate is.

669
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,320
I have both systems, I should have both games, especially if they do something different

670
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,880
for one than the other.

671
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,960
I honestly, my preference would be to have it on Xbox 360 if they're not doing anything

672
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,320
different for it, because I would rather not have like jaggedy edges, and I'd rather have

673
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:20,060
better sound capability and more processing power, and the ability to potentially download

674
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
more songs.

675
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
Exactly.

676
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,800
For me, it's like Karaoke Revolution on Xbox versus PlayStation 2.

677
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,720
I love the PlayStation 2, and it's great, but when you put the two platforms side by

678
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,820
side in a game like Karaoke Revolution, I could download more songs on the Xbox version,

679
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,800
and I could use my regular microphone as the microphone.

680
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,740
It kind of worked better on Xbox, and I have a feeling Guitar Hero 2 is going to be a little

681
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:47,440
better on 360 just because of the additional things that the 360 natively supports.

682
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,760
I need to completely tell Jaded2006 that, you're wrong, there are a lot, there's a lot

683
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
of graphical detail.

684
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,980
In fact, all the character models, they put a lot of work into them, the animations.

685
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,720
If you look at all the stuff that goes on on the stage in the backgrounds of these areas,

686
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,680
they're actually pretty darn good.

687
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,280
Oh, did he say that the Guitar Hero doesn't have that great graphics?

688
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
It just doesn't have that much in the way of graphics in the first place.

689
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Yeah, it does.

690
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,760
DDR is just a bunch of movies playing in the background with edit character dancing.

691
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,560
This actually has a whole lot that went into it.

692
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,600
Which is actually part of the reason it did so well is because it really kind of had that

693
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,000
silly quality to it that kind of puts you there, you know what I mean?

694
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,040
Having all that stuff and the crowd and everything kind of did something for the game in a way

695
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,880
the guitar freaks didn't, you know what I mean?

696
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,000
I guess what I actually liked about it is that it sort of incorporated the things I

697
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,480
liked about Karaoke Revolution, you know, where you have the stage and the whole contest

698
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,560
thing and, you know, sort of like puts a little bit more into the game.

699
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,280
I thought it was like, yeah, let's go ahead and rock out here.

700
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,440
I thought that that was pretty cool, it added a great deal of fun to the game.

701
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,400
Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, his own show is over at AllGames.com on Sunday nights,

702
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,600
5 o'clock Pacific.

703
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,400
He says, it hit me, or it finally hit me that now I have to buy another guitar even though

704
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,640
I already have the PlayStation 2 one.

705
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Yeah.

706
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Wah wah.

707
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Somewhere you're hearing that in the background.

708
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,320
You know how we felt trying to do second player with the guitar freaks controller?

709
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Yeah.

710
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,440
Well now you guys know how we feel, you know, being DDR fans about all these DDR pads for

711
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
the different platforms, too.

712
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,000
It's like, God, I have five DDR pads.

713
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,740
They just get the multi-pad.

714
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,840
But even then, the Red Octane one, the last one they did, it doesn't support 360, so there's

715
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,840
going to be another pad that comes out I'm going to have to get for freaking Universe.

716
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Yeah.

717
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Oh well.

718
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,600
And you know they're not going to just go, let's support the USB pad from Red Octane.

719
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Let's do that.

720
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
Let's do that favor.

721
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Yeah.

722
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
No, it's not going to happen.

723
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
All right.

724
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,160
I do like the 360 guitar that looks like a Thunderbird, but anyway, we have a little

725
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,120
bit more.

726
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:05,000
Now, I don't know if all our listeners know this, but I am a closet wrestling fan, so

727
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:15,880
there is a demo for SmackDown versus Raw available on Xbox Live Marketplace for the 2007 version.

728
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,600
Also joining that is Tony Hawk's Project 8, Wheelman, Frontlines, Fuel of War, and Crossfire,

729
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,440
and the montage thing, which I actually haven't watched yet.

730
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,540
Also for our listeners who are in France, Italy, Germany, or Spain, if you miss the

731
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:37,560
Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion download content, it is back up for 150 Microsoft points a piece,

732
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,800
but I want my wrestling.

733
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,280
Yeah, they had some pretty good videos up on Live Marketplace.

734
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:51,080
Some interesting stuff also coming from X06, of course, a lot to even mention, but of course

735
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,200
they announced that Splinter Cell 5, the one after Double Agent, is going to be exclusive

736
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,440
to the 360, which I thought was pretty interesting.

737
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:06,000
Bioshock, the very amazing looking game, is going to be a 360 exclusive, which is coming

738
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,480
out in April, by the way, and also on the Windows platform.

739
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,880
The game looks amazing, so if you haven't checked out the video yet, please do yourself

740
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,400
a favor and check it out now.

741
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,100
Some surprises, I should say, Banjo-Kazooie, they announced a new game in that franchise

742
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:33,120
for the 360, some not so big surprises, Project Gotham Racing 4 was being worked on, and they

743
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,240
had a very generic looking trailer for that.

744
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,760
But the trailer was a joke, I mean it was nothing but, it was kind of like the Simpsons

745
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,760
teaser trailer, well at least that was funny, I mean it had a gag in it, but you know there

746
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,040
really wasn't anything to it, you know what I mean, it's just kind of like, the game's

747
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:52,880
coming, soon, I mean but the Halo 3 teaser trailer was like, ooh, you know, I am the

748
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,560
future, you know, that whole thing.

749
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
That's how you do a teaser trailer.

750
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,200
There will be an MMO coming to the Xbox 360 with Marvel Universe Online, which is supposed

751
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:10,640
to be kind of a sequel to, what was it, oh I'm drawing a mental blink now, I was going

752
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,320
to say, you know, Phantasy Star Universe is coming too, that's an MMO, but, well no, City

753
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,820
of Heroes, it seems to be working together on that, and they'll also be hitting Windows

754
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:26,200
as well, and it's even being worked on by Cryptic Studios, the, of course, creators

755
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,780
of City of Heroes.

756
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,760
And then finally, the last bit of info they talked about was the HD DVD player for the

757
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,240
Xbox 360, it's going to be priced at $199 in North America, with pretty much equivalent

758
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:49,320
pricing in the rest of the world, and they will be including a free copy, not to be surprising

759
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:56,560
after the whole announcement of Peter Jackson working on Halo of King Kong, as well as Universal

760
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,320
Remote.

761
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,520
That's a good movie to test your player on, because it's a nice, good, long, very long,

762
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,800
very overly long sample movie to include to test on the HD DVD player.

763
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,160
So yeah, lots of good stuff coming out.

764
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,520
I like the movie, it was just nice.

765
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,080
There was some other announcements, I think, that have already been made before about how

766
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:26,560
Rockstar is going to be making exclusive content for the Xbox 360 version of Gran Turismo 4,

767
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,520
which is not a huge, I mean, it's big, but, I mean, we already know that, and yeah, there's

768
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,780
lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of games and trailers, and they showed off Half-Life

769
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,800
2, and that looked pretty and stuff.

770
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,200
Now out of curiosity, did Rockstar say that they weren't doing something similar on

771
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,760
PlayStation 3, I mean, I know they said these episodes or whatever were exclusive for 360,

772
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,080
but if PlayStation 3 supports microtransactions, which after last week's Gran Turismo thing

773
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,560
we know it's going to, what's to say that they won't cook up different scenarios for

774
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,440
the PlayStation 3, and it'll be, you know, here's...

775
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,480
Or additional two, these two.

776
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,520
Or, you know, some different scenarios that are going to be on PlayStation 3, so it's

777
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,120
like, it's that whole, you know, Soul Calibur 2, play with Link on the GameCube, play with,

778
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,160
you know, Spawn on the Xbox all over again, you know?

779
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,400
Something a little different.

780
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,600
We don't know a whole lot about, you know, the PlayStation 3 marketplace or whatever,

781
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,960
so they might be running into other obstacles, you know, with this type of stuff, because

782
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,740
if you notice, a lot of like companies, I know Sega for Virtua Tennis 3 actually took

783
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:34,280
out online play on it, for the PlayStation 3 version, because apparently they're running

784
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,240
into some difficulties, so yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you see something, especially

785
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,640
if the marketplace is taken off, you know, after the PlayStation 3 launches.

786
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,080
I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4 is just going to be the next big thing.

787
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,960
I mean, it's just huge, so yeah, I can't wait.

788
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,200
Yeah, Saints Row's popularity is any indication.

789
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,400
I think 360 players are really eager for some Grand Theft Autos, so it should be interesting.

790
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,080
Saints Row will whet the appetite for now, but I can't wait.

791
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,640
All right, we'll see.

792
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Well, now the only news to come out this week wasn't just about the Xbox.

793
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,080
I mean, granted, we have a lot of Xbox news because they had, you know, their big X06,

794
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,880
but there are some news on the other consoles.

795
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,600
One thing I want to say about the PlayStation 3, according to Bloomberg, Sony is going to

796
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,840
be launching a massive PlayStation 3 marketing campaign.

797
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:28,680
Now, they're going to have demo kiosks in five times as many stores as the PlayStation

798
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,680
2.

799
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,480
Yeah, the PlayStation 2 had about 3,000 demo stations.

800
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:40,520
The PlayStation 3 is supposedly going to have like 10,000 up to maybe 15,000 demo stations,

801
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,160
so that's like five times as many if it's 15,000, which is kind of weird when you consider

802
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,980
that there's supposed to be that big console shortage they're going to have at launch,

803
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,680
so it's like, you know, you could be putting some of that into producing extra consoles,

804
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
but whatever.

805
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,340
I mean, they're not saying that all five times of this is going to hit it once, so who knows?

806
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,800
Maybe they're running all off of the rack mount servers.

807
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,080
Maybe that's what they're going to use them for afterwards.

808
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Who knows?

809
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
Actually, it might not be a bad idea.

810
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Who knows?

811
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
That just was so pitiful.

812
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Well, I mean...

813
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
I know.

814
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
I know.

815
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
I know.

816
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
You've got to do what you've got to do.

817
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,940
Three steps in the right direction because they're going to need to market the hell out

818
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,920
of this thing to convince people, here's why you need to spend $600 on this.

819
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,160
Well, you said it right there, and I mean, even the most fanboy of Sony has to admit,

820
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:36,500
you know, Sony needs to show us and the casual gamer why you want to spend $600 on this system,

821
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
so they do need to put it out.

822
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,480
It should be demoing Blu-ray movies and some hot trailers of PS3 exclusives, put some Metal

823
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,040
Gear Solid demos on there, you know, something like that, and really sell the hell out of

824
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,480
your system, and that might help you.

825
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,740
Well, actually, this is sort of related to something actually that was just given to

826
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,640
me not a few moments ago from our chat room, if that's fine.

827
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Sure.

828
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,840
PSM got an actual PlayStation Magazine got an actual fully functional PS3 console delivered

829
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
to them.

830
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
Hmm.

831
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
That's not too surprising.

832
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,440
Well, yeah, it is PSM, so that makes sense.

833
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,820
But I think it's pretty funny that they, you know, they're actually starting to get these

834
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,460
out now to, you know, I guess they're VIPs.

835
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,480
They shouldn't have sent it without games because, you know, they said, you know, the

836
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,880
PS3, you'll buy it even if it doesn't have games because it's PlayStation.

837
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,480
There's a reflection of MotorStorm showing on the console in this picture.

838
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,720
It's pretty, pretty fun.

839
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Hmm.

840
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:48,480
But anyway, as far as other systems coming out, Walmart, yes, everybody's favorite, you

841
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,000
know, low-price store of crappy goods.

842
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,560
Hey, but don't laugh at my picture.

843
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,280
I get decent stuff there once in a while.

844
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,960
It's not my favorite place to shop, but, you know.

845
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,960
I got the best shirt there.

846
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,560
It says, I love pirates and has a pirate ship on the butt.

847
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,360
But anyway, Walmart is considering not using the Wii demo station at their stores because

848
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:16,600
of the risk of a child or consumer using the Wii mote like a real nunchuck.

849
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
It's just stupid.

850
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:26,800
Do they have that little faith in the quality of their patrons that they're going, oh, we're

851
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,200
going to go hitting each other with the Wii mote?

852
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,320
Have you been to Walmart recently?

853
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,320
Yes.

854
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,960
I mean, maybe it's not so far off.

855
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,360
Maybe it is something you need to consider.

856
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,080
But I'm thinking, they've had the iToy for PS2 demoed there and that's one of those games

857
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,240
that encourages you to flap your arms about.

858
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,600
Flapping, hitting somebody with your hand, you know, just by accident is a lot different

859
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,240
than smacking somebody in the head with a piece of hard plastic.

860
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,200
Yeah, but won't they have the hard plastic on some type of chain or it's only going to

861
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,640
have a limited range anyway?

862
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,760
I don't give the, you know, corporate powers that be at Walmart that much mental.

863
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,440
You're going to end up getting broken or stolen.

864
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,400
I honestly am not surprised, but that just means that people will go to places other

865
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,520
than Walmart to buy their Wii, won't it?

866
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,960
Not really, because you may not have an option in some parts of the nation.

867
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,720
People will just go to other parts, you know, other stores to demo the Wii and they can

868
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,000
buy it at Walmart because they're the low-priced leader, of course.

869
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,440
They're also the low-quality leader, too.

870
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,440
Hi, Walmart!

871
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,880
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Launch Radio do not pass.

872
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,080
The one good thing about Walmart is that when I lived in Alabama, Super Walmart was open

873
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,040
24 hours and I had somewhere to go when I was bored, other than Denny's.

874
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,040
Wow.

875
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,040
Walmart.

876
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,040
You know what?

877
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
When I was in college in Chico, it was the same thing.

878
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,160
We'd go to Walmart because we were bored and they were open 24 hours.

879
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Sad.

880
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,680
Basically, this is before I even heard of Eddie Izzard.

881
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,160
We would do the Eddie Izzard Theory of Shopping, where you just grab stuff, move it around,

882
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,040
and then leave, because that's illegal!

883
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:06,280
Anyways, some other stores that I used to like to go to at least as a kid, Toys R Us.

884
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,800
What happened to Toys R Us?

885
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
So sad.

886
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
Really?

887
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,680
I actually sometimes do my gaming shopping there.

888
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,880
They have Jeffrey Chang in the basement.

889
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:22,440
Combine Kids R Us and Toys R Us and Babies R Us, it's less Toys R Us and more Toddler

890
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Craft.

891
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Pampers.

892
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,980
Well, they still have a pretty decent video gaming section, I've got to say, and if you've

893
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,360
ever been to Toys R Us and Times Square, it's hot.

894
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,840
Some of those big, big Toys R Us's are hot.

895
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,200
Okay, well I haven't been there.

896
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,560
But anyways, one of the things that they had, of course, is their holiday list of must-have

897
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:45,080
items, and of course, on the list was the Nintendo Wii.

898
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,080
What wasn't on the list?

899
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,180
The PlayStation 3.

900
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,440
The reason behind this is a couple things.

901
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,560
One, the PlayStation 3 is really geared towards savvy gaming enthusiasts, whereas the Nintendo

902
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,000
Wii is basically going to appeal to young kids as well, as adults.

903
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,640
The other thing is, one of their criteria for making this list is knowing that they're

904
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:12,640
going to have a sufficient stock for the item during the holiday season, which we know that

905
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,720
the PlayStation 3, that will not be the case.

906
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
Very interesting.

907
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,200
I do see this, I think the Wii would kind of mesh very well with Toys R Us.

908
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,000
It seems to be the same kind of clientele.

909
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,560
Alright, well as Loki was saying, part of the reason that Toys R Us maybe put the Wii

910
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,480
on their list is that they're not expecting to have a shortage.

911
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,960
Nintendo has confirmed they are going to be shipping one million units of the Wii in North

912
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,360
America on November 19th, and when I say North America, that means US and Canada, so you

913
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,320
Canadians will get some lovin' from Nintendo too, so no worries.

914
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,600
Because actually the news came from Nintendo of Canada's Vice President, saying we're looking

915
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,320
at a million units for North America at launch.

916
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,800
You may remember that previously our dear friend Reggie said that four million Wiis will

917
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,320
be out by the end of the year, the majority of them for North America, and now it's confirmed

918
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,000
that about one million are going to hit North America.

919
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,920
And I'm expecting probably another million by the end of the year.

920
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,960
Now there was a late update that suggests that perhaps there might even be more than

921
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,220
a million that hit on launch day, because you know what I'm thinking, with as huge as

922
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,520
people are expecting this to be, a million may not be enough.

923
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,880
I would still think they're going to be sold out.

924
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,400
Even with a million, they're going to be sold out some places.

925
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,760
I think they're going to be sold out no matter what, but at least they're going to have

926
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,320
a million units, and a million is a good number to put out there.

927
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,400
It's a safe number instead of saying, we're going to have four billion units at launch,

928
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,120
just shipping only four, you know?

929
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
I don't know.

930
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,520
It should be pretty cool.

931
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,800
Some of the cool stuff about the Wii, though, came out this week.

932
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,240
So talking a little bit about some of the Wii channels, including the Wii message board

933
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,120
and the new one that I haven't heard of at least, Play History, which Play History is

934
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:09,780
going to be sort of similar to the, kind of like what the 360 has, where you can see the

935
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,600
games that people have played and stuff.

936
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,480
But I think they're even going to go into greater detail with that, because originally

937
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,200
the Play History was supposed to be a way for parents to be able to limit the amount

938
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
of gaming kids would have.

939
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,800
So you'd be able to shut the console off after a certain amount of hours and stuff.

940
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,520
Apparently that didn't work out too well, so this came to be instead.

941
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,320
So Play History will actually be, you know, charting a bunch of different stats, of course,

942
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,160
the majority being your game playing time.

943
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,400
Now the Wii message board is kind of like a little mini, almost email or message board

944
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,480
system.

945
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,400
You can leave messages for other people that use the Wii, as well as send those messages

946
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,840
to mobile phones and, you know, I would imagine PCs and email and that type of stuff.

947
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:01,920
Plus, certain games, say like Animal Crossing, may send you messages as well, you know, so

948
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,880
you'd be getting the emails or the mail from Animal Crossing in your message board.

949
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,400
So it's kind of neat.

950
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,240
You know, this whole Play History thing is very interesting to me.

951
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,320
So in other words, like, if I'm staying up past my bedtime to play the Wii, if I'm a

952
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,560
savvy enough parent, I can go in there and see that, you know, my kid's been up past

953
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,800
his bedtime playing the Wii, and I can take the cord or, you know, something away.

954
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,800
I don't know.

955
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,800
That's kind of interesting.

956
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
What do you guys think about that?

957
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,240
Is that a good thing or is that, sure, you know?

958
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,960
Yeah, I think that's a good thing because, you know what, parents need the tools.

959
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,680
If they are having trouble monitoring their, you know, the amount of gaming their kids

960
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,880
have and they want to, I think it's good that they're providing a way for them to be able

961
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,880
to do that.

962
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,180
And you know what, whether they use that or not, that's kind of up to them.

963
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,520
But at least Nintendo is providing you the tools.

964
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:56,700
Same thing with, like, the lockouts for different content based on the, you know, content ratings.

965
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,240
If they have those parental locks in place, at least they're providing them the tools,

966
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,280
you know, to be able to block that content from, you know, say their children that might

967
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,880
not be appropriate.

968
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,080
So I think it's good to give them the tools.

969
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,280
The controls should be put in the parent's hand for the content that their children sees.

970
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,400
I mean, that's responsible parroting.

971
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,400
Interesting.

972
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,940
What do you guys think about the fact that Nintendo is probably going to be tracking

973
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,940
what you play?

974
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,200
I mean, is that an invasion of privacy?

975
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,840
Well, I don't know if they are.

976
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,840
I mean...

977
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
It's the same.

978
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,000
Well, if it's tracking it in the play history, I mean, it's always connected to the Internet.

979
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,280
How do you feel about TiVo tracking what you watch?

980
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,000
I mean, I'm just, I actually, well, I'm just, I'm playing Devil's Advocate here.

981
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,400
I don't think it's a big deal because 360 does the same thing.

982
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,400
You know it does.

983
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Who cares?

984
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,880
Because you can see the last five games you've played and it's, you know, I'm sure...

985
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,720
Unless they come out with, like, you know, some nasty ass porn games, you know, then

986
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,720
whatever.

987
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,720
Who cares?

988
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
Who cares?

989
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,720
So they know what I'm playing.

990
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,720
Big deal.

991
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,720
Okay.

992
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,720
I don't know.

993
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,720
Just curious.

994
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,000
I, I do think that there is an advantage in checking it in terms of, especially if you've

995
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,920
got your general region in terms of demographics, they'll know what games are being played more

996
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,120
in what areas, who to market to, what to market.

997
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:12,520
I actually think that if they use it for their, you know, for their sales, from a sales perspective,

998
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:18,720
it can really increase their profit by gearing toward the different audiences, seeing who's

999
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,640
playing the most of what.

1000
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Yeah.

1001
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,640
Interesting.

1002
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Ooh.

1003
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,320
Tarktitsia says, Gals panic on Xbox Live Arcade.

1004
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,640
I can only hope someday.

1005
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:36,220
Mecklar in our chat room says, the good point of it is that if a first party game is popular,

1006
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,480
we get more of them.

1007
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,760
So but yeah, but don't they already track that through sales in a way if a game is popular?

1008
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Not necessarily.

1009
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,760
I think.

1010
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,760
Yeah.

1011
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,760
They track through sales.

1012
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,760
Hmm.

1013
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,600
I, but sales doesn't tell you exactly who's playing what.

1014
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,600
It would be an interesting comparison.

1015
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,760
You know, sure, people bought this, but how long are they actually playing it?

1016
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,760
See, that's my point.

1017
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,760
Before they sold it back to GameStop.

1018
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,760
That's my point.

1019
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,680
I think if you see what type of games have the most playability, what's going to have

1020
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:07,120
the most longevity, then they're going to be able to say, okay, well, we put this here

1021
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,960
and then we say, do you want to keep renewing your experience on this game here is X add

1022
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,260
on.

1023
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,400
You know what I just realized?

1024
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,520
Nintendo's already tracking what games you play on the DS because if you go to Nintendo

1025
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,480
Wi-Fi.com, it shows the most popular Wi-Fi games and the last 20 people that played them

1026
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
and everything.

1027
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,320
So Nintendo's been quote unquote violating your privacy in that way for some time, but

1028
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
I don't think it's a big deal.

1029
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,440
I think violating privacy is posting your pictochat.

1030
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,440
Yeah.

1031
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,760
You know, having big pictures of like a bunch of cocks.

1032
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,880
Or if I moon one of our listeners on Uno on Xbox Live Arcade, I wouldn't want Microsoft

1033
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,880
to post that on the interweb.

1034
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,240
Free on Xbox Live, Rob's ass.

1035
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,000
Send it as your background.

1036
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,520
It's a theme that you can download this week.

1037
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,240
I would not download the Rob's ass theme, sorry.

1038
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,120
I would not allow it to be distributed.

1039
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,040
Anyway, this is something much more exciting.

1040
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,560
I squeed like a little girl and probably did run around the house naked when I read this

1041
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,560
news.

1042
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,560
DMN wants to see your ass.

1043
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,160
When I saw this and I posted it, I knew that you'd be squeaking like a little girl.

1044
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,880
This made me squeal like a little girl.

1045
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,040
There's a rumor out there, I don't know if it's rumor or fact or what's going on, but

1046
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,880
Commodore 64 is supposed to be joining the Wii Virtual Console lineup.

1047
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,560
I played so much, like Commodore 64 was my gaming system in that period between the 2600

1048
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,280
and the NES for me.

1049
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,280
Like oh my god, this makes me so happy.

1050
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,880
Gamasutra is reporting that the Virtual Console update says that no game titles are specified

1051
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,520
but there are indications that classic epics titles, games like California Games, Summer

1052
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,320
Games, Impossible Mission, and Jumpman may make an appearance.

1053
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,720
I love you, my Jumpman.

1054
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,600
Oh god, the announcement is a matter of time before they announce like M-U-L-E, Pinball

1055
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Construction.

1056
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,360
Jumpman was my game on the Coleco, that's what I used to play all the time.

1057
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,360
Well now what's interesting is that when Kotaku posted this story, one of their chat commenters

1058
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,460
posted this interesting update.

1059
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:06,180
They wrote to say that Nintendo Power, where this was also ran, I guess is where most people

1060
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:11,460
picked this up from, the editors were speculating that Commodore 64 games will hit Virtual Console

1061
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,960
land and that a handful of epics games were being reworked for the Wii.

1062
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,460
Quote, a Nintendo Power editor merely speculated the announced Commodore 64 games would come

1063
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,620
to the Virtual Console when in fact two were being remade for the PSP, DS, and Wii.

1064
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:29,860
To quote, System 3 will release Impossible Mission on the PSP and DS in January of 07,

1065
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,640
three weeks later it will come to Wii, with California Games for PSP and DS in May of

1066
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,840
07, and again three weeks later it will come to the Wii.

1067
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
Huh.

1068
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,600
You know, either way, no matter where these games are coming, I'm just really excited

1069
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:47,220
to see some Commodore 64 love in this era of gaming because damn I loved me some Impossible

1070
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,860
Mission, although that game was impossible as fuck.

1071
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,780
It was called Impossible Mission for a reason, it was so hard.

1072
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,620
I want the old Apple IIe games.

1073
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,620
Like Oregon Trail?

1074
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,620
Yeah.

1075
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,620
Are you waiting for Oregon Trail to come to Virtual Console?

1076
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,620
Gnarly Golf.

1077
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,940
And I want old school kicks.

1078
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:07,580
That was my favorite game, Gnarly Golf, on the Apple IIe, and yes, I did play Apple way

1079
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:14,060
back in the day when that was the only option for actual gaming, which is ironic, I mean.

1080
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:19,340
I still sometimes dust off the Atari 5200 just to play kicks.

1081
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,260
That's pretty cool.

1082
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,500
Alright, well, you know, with all this Wii Virtual Console news, I'm sure someday you'll

1083
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,340
be able to send us messages on the Wii and they'll come up on our screen, but for the

1084
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:35,180
time being, we have our old fashioned mailbag and it's email, and every week you send us

1085
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,180
emails and Dark Sakura goes in there in her hazmat suit and pulls out a few of her favorites

1086
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,620
to share with you folks.

1087
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,340
So when you send email to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, it might just get read

1088
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:51,180
on the air, like we're going to read some right now, right, Dark Sakura?

1089
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,580
Absolutely.

1090
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:59,380
Well, my actual favorite email out of this lot came from Warrior Bob, but it's really,

1091
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:04,860
really freaking long, so if you don't mind, I'm going to post it up on the forums because

1092
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,700
it is really long.

1093
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:10,380
You know, just really long emails get posted on the forum, how about that?

1094
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,540
Anyway, got one from Mekar.

1095
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:17,300
Wait, was the Warrior Bob one, the really long one, and then like, he's talking about

1096
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:22,900
the next gen gaming, and then at the very end it says, so in conclusion, Buy Right Sucks.

1097
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,060
That's exactly what it says, in conclusion, Buy Right Sucks.

1098
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,500
That made me crack up when I read it.

1099
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,420
But I like this last line though, I can assure you that years from now I'll still be playing

1100
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,740
something really, really old alongside my newest, shiniest game.

1101
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:39,260
I actually should put that out there, we're no longer going to be asking your permission

1102
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:43,780
to post your letters, if you send us something to Orange Lounge Radio's mailbag, here or

1103
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,860
on out, you've been warned, we might post it on our forums.

1104
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:52,500
But out of respect, unless you want us to, we will post nicknames but not real names.

1105
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Yeah, yeah.

1106
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,500
To protect the not-so-innocent.

1107
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:01,100
Anyway, Mekar wrote in, I started listening to Orange Lounge Radio last week on your 200th

1108
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,100
episode, I must say it was my first podcast and I haven't laughed so much in ages.

1109
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,620
God, what a one to have as your first one.

1110
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,900
Just to say thanks for putting out a great show and it's nice to see a US show mentioning

1111
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,900
the UK.

1112
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,900
I also have to admit that you guys were responsible for me purchasing an Xbox 360, I'd heard of

1113
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,260
some okay stuff about it but hearing all the good stuff you guys were saying about Saints

1114
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,340
Row and Dead Rising got me interested.

1115
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:31,260
The live arcade information sold me, so on Friday I went out and spent the 365 pounds

1116
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:37,820
on 360 and Dead Rising and Saints Row, I'm so happy I got it, it rules, so thanks guys.

1117
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,940
Didn't they just slice the price by five pounds, so a 360 would be 360 pounds?

1118
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,940
That'd be funny.

1119
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:48,900
Yeah, I know, I mean come on, it's five pounds, which I realize is like seven or eight bucks

1120
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:55,860
US, but still it's not that much, but I mean that's a very nice compliment that somebody

1121
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:01,420
would go out and make that kind of investment based on what we've said, it's even more so

1122
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,460
the investment in the UK because things are more expensive over there, so that's a very

1123
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,460
nice compliment.

1124
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:10,180
It's very interesting since it's all lies!

1125
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,180
We love the 360.

1126
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,180
What?

1127
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:18,780
Our next email doesn't actually have a nickname on it, so I'm just going to say it's from

1128
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,780
Sean.

1129
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Hello, OLR, I wanted to first wish all of you a happy belated 200th episode, I've been

1130
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,180
listening to your show for forever but haven't really interacted until just now, just felt

1131
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,220
like thanking you guys for being awesome.

1132
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,820
I saw you guys at B3 and everything, you guys are the best.

1133
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:42,020
Anyway, just wanted to know, excuse me, what your thoughts are on microtransactions and

1134
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,860
games in general, and also an opinion on the news that Gran Turismo HD will be almost entirely

1135
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:52,620
microtransaction based, costing only the cost of the disc and packaging, but with the premium

1136
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,420
mode having a few tracks and cars available from the start.

1137
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,220
My opinion, it defeats the purpose of having the game to begin with, as I always play the

1138
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,500
Gran Turismo games to rack up huge amounts of money, unlock new tracks and cars and whatnots

1139
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,300
and just have fun, I don't want to have to actively make purchasing decisions for a game,

1140
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,020
I just want to pay my 50 to 60 bucks and be done with it.

1141
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:16,020
And while I understand that this is a popular trend in Korean MMOs such as MapleStory and

1142
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:21,460
Pangya Golf, those games actually have content that you can earn which makes playing them

1143
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:26,700
fun and having the purchasable items as a bonus to look cool only.

1144
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,240
I want to be able to earn cars just like I've been doing for the last 4 GTs instead of their

1145
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,260
new version of a game where you play it only for a few minutes a day.

1146
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,500
I just wanted to know your thoughts on it and let you know that you guys rock and I

1147
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,000
hope you keep podcasting into the future, thanks.

1148
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Thank you.

1149
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,940
I think this is funny, Haz in our chat room says, micro-rape-men is more like it.

1150
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:50,580
I do have to say the microtransaction thing for a racing game, I was going back and thinking

1151
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:56,740
about it, you know, and if it's trying to, the point of Gran Turismo was the point of

1152
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:01,140
putting you into a realistic racing situation, right?

1153
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:05,580
Well if you are a professional racer, you are going to go out and spend money to buy

1154
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,860
your cars, to buy your upgraded parts, you are going to go shopping.

1155
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:16,620
If the point of Gran Turismo is to reflect the more realistic side of racing, then that

1156
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,800
makes sense.

1157
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:24,260
I'm okay with microtransactions, I think in certain types of games and certain ways that

1158
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,900
it's used, it's actually pretty cool.

1159
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:31,040
For instance, new songs in DDR and Karaoke Revolution and those games, new maps and shooter

1160
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,860
games like Halo 2, in fact I really like the way Halo 2 did it where for a while it was

1161
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,660
pay and then it was free, but of course I'm going to love anything that's free.

1162
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,660
I think it's good for new tracks and things.

1163
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:49,180
For me it's about, when I buy the initial game, you know, if the game cost me 50 bucks

1164
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:55,760
or 60 bucks, am I getting 50 or 60 bucks worth of game or are you relying on microtransactions

1165
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,020
to be the full experience of the game?

1166
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,820
This is where that Gran Turismo thing really worries me.

1167
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:06,300
If they're only going to charge me 20 bucks for the game and give me a couple tracks and

1168
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:12,340
a couple cars, then that might be okay, but don't go charging me 60 bucks for no game

1169
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,860
and then expect me to buy all these microtransactions.

1170
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,580
It's got to be worth what I'm paying for them.

1171
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,220
Some of these microtransactions are a joke.

1172
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:26,680
I'm not going to pay for new costumes, especially when they are inspired by commercial things

1173
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,340
that should be taken care of at a sponsorship.

1174
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:35,580
They need to do it like Test Drive Unlimited I think is doing it, where the game is cheap

1175
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,300
because they knew right away that there's going to be lots of microtransactions, but

1176
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,940
you do not need to buy them to be able to enjoy the game.

1177
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:47,900
The way they're making Gran Turismo HD sound, oh by the way, if you want to play online,

1178
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,340
you've got to buy the cars first.

1179
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,660
So that's kind of fucked up, I think, right there.

1180
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,260
So why am I buying this game again?

1181
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:01,220
And to be honest, I've seen the video of Gran Turismo HD, apparently the premium one or

1182
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,220
whatever.

1183
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:07,060
I'm not impressed by it at all, and I think it would be a waste of money to buy it.

1184
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,980
But you know what, if you're a huge fan of Gran Turismo, then yeah, go ahead and purchase

1185
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:10,980
that game.

1186
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,860
But I think it's a mistake to expect you to purchase cars before you can race online.

1187
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,020
I think that's dumb.

1188
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:21,520
I think that you should be able to have a sponsor on your car, and then you don't have

1189
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
to pay.

1190
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,940
That's an interesting way to do it.

1191
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,380
Your sponsor pays for your purchase.

1192
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:27,380
Interesting.

1193
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,980
I want to read some quick comments from chat room.

1194
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:34,380
Mecklar from our chat room says, microtransaction items should only be there for after the game

1195
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,380
has been completed.

1196
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,380
Exactly.

1197
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,460
That's a good thought.

1198
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,020
Jeremy Todd 1 says, it's the same thing with Luminous for the 360 arcade.

1199
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,180
You have to buy different game modes, and that might...

1200
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,180
That is retarded.

1201
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,180
That might even scare...

1202
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,220
I mean, well, we haven't really seen the final, final, what it's really going to be yet, but

1203
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,260
that might scare me off from Luminous on 360.

1204
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:55,780
I think Joystiq reviewed it at X06 and didn't exactly have the brightest things to say about

1205
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,780
that, which is a little disappointing.

1206
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:01,420
I liked it when I played it at E3, but it's going to come down to what am I going to get

1207
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:03,300
for the base price.

1208
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,380
I'm not going to buy the game just to have to microtransaction it out to really get the

1209
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,060
full feel out of it.

1210
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:13,580
Well, to move on to our next email, unless we've got anything more to add.

1211
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,580
Not really.

1212
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,580
Oh, wait.

1213
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,580
Here's one interesting chat comment.

1214
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,900
Bandit says, what if you could earn real life gas for your car by winning races in Turismo?

1215
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,460
Not likely.

1216
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,060
Not likely, but it would be an interesting tie-in.

1217
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:28,100
See, I think what they should do if they really want to have realism in the game is that you

1218
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:33,620
actually earn actual, well, not actual, but comparable money in their game environment

1219
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:40,820
and have to pay for your gas and pay your crew and pay to buy your new stuff.

1220
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,420
That should be how they do it.

1221
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,340
One more quick chat comment and then we'll let DarkSucker get to the next email.

1222
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,300
FootyMonster says, if the game is going to be gimped because you don't have the extra

1223
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,140
content, then that's wrong.

1224
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,300
What you got off the shelves should be enough to enjoy.

1225
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,300
I agree.

1226
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:00,180
Also, I'd like to give FootyMonster a big hello for listening in from Argentina.

1227
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,660
We love our worldwide audience.

1228
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,660
Absolutely.

1229
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:05,500
We love our domestic audience, too, but we love the worldwide audience as well.

1230
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,060
Our next one comes from Matt.

1231
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,060
Hey, O-R-L.

1232
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,060
Oh, really?

1233
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,060
Oh, really.

1234
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:17,860
Long time listener to your great podcast, but this is my first time writing in.

1235
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,180
I just got done writing Xbox about how disappointed I was when I attempted playing UNO for the

1236
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:25,920
first time since they added that god-awful contraption called The Vision.

1237
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,800
Never have I been so appalled.

1238
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,700
If seeing underage boys showing their Wii and masturbating wasn't enough, I actually

1239
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,780
saw this one guy shooting up an unknown drug.

1240
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,420
Why is Microsoft allowing this behavior to happen?

1241
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,420
That's awesome.

1242
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,420
It's really discredited.

1243
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,420
Let me finish.

1244
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:44,780
It's really discrediting them as a serious game platform anymore.

1245
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:49,200
I guess with Sony's and Microsoft's recent bad management decisions, I guess I'll have

1246
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:55,380
to trade them Xbox 360 and pre-order the only Wii that I want to see and play with, Nintendo's

1247
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,380
new system.

1248
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,900
At least I know that they wouldn't allow this type of behavior to happen on their network.

1249
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,420
Please let me know what you guys think of this.

1250
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,260
Thanks, and keep up the great work.

1251
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,500
Whenever there is a camera peripheral, you can better believe you're going to see someone

1252
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,500
naked.

1253
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,940
That is just the fact.

1254
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:10,940
You know what?

1255
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:11,940
That's nothing that they have control over.

1256
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,220
I don't want to see some frickin' 16 or 17-year-old person running around naked on their camera.

1257
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,220
That's illegal.

1258
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,220
Hello?

1259
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,220
That's not okay.

1260
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,220
That's non-consensual.

1261
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,740
I'm being raped with these images.

1262
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,420
Here's the other thing too.

1263
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,420
Why the hell?

1264
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,700
Here's what they should have.

1265
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:33,180
They should have an option for each player, if you do not want to view that, that you

1266
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,180
can shut the window off.

1267
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,180
I think they do.

1268
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,180
Don't they?

1269
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,180
I'm not sure.

1270
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,820
I don't have the camera still, so you've got to tell me.

1271
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,820
I don't know.

1272
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:43,100
I've seen Uno once on live with the camera.

1273
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:48,660
Well, what you can do is that inside 360's system, you can warn, and you can do either

1274
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,780
the rep damaging thing, where you say, I want to avoid this player and why, and it damages

1275
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,360
their star rating, and I'm not afraid to use that.

1276
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,980
I use that all the time on people who sit there when I'm playing Uno, and there's that

1277
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:04,900
kid going, ah, ah, ah.

1278
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
You know what?

1279
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,220
I'm just like, shut the fuck up.

1280
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,220
Bandits got it.

1281
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,180
Where are the parents?

1282
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:11,980
Probably shooting up dress queue.

1283
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:12,980
Here's the thing.

1284
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:13,980
Here's the thing.

1285
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:18,700
What you need to do, report it, because there's that, and then there's the notify Microsoft

1286
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:23,380
about this, and Microsoft supposedly is going to monitor this, and hopefully they really

1287
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,580
will, because they're supposed to do it with the audio, and wouldn't that be something

1288
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:31,700
if suddenly the account gets suspended, the Xbox Live account, and something happens with

1289
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:35,180
the credit card, either there's a refund, and so suddenly the parents will find out

1290
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,180
about it.

1291
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,780
Johnny, why did you get banned from Xbox Live?

1292
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,780
I don't know.

1293
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:41,780
They're here!

1294
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:43,920
Eddie says it's probably in the parental controls.

1295
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,660
Also at-deaf says, I can star rate you, and I'm not afraid to use it.

1296
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,660
You know what, though?

1297
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:52,340
I still think it makes Uno edgier.

1298
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,140
It makes me want to play it more because of the naked chicks.

1299
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:59,860
But they're, that's gross, because some of them are like 16 and 17.

1300
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,860
What are you going to do?

1301
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,780
Ask each one, you know, when they're about to take their top off?

1302
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1303
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,780
Yay, team.

1304
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,780
Sure I am.

1305
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,780
Continue.

1306
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:07,780
Continue.

1307
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:12,180
I don't, you know, I don't know.

1308
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,180
Come on.

1309
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,180
There's a difference between someone.

1310
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,180
They don't care.

1311
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:19,420
There's a difference between someone flashing their butt really quick and someone like jerking

1312
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,420
it off on camera.

1313
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,420
That's disgusting.

1314
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:22,420
Microsoft.

1315
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,940
If I want to see that, there's websites I can go to for that, okay?

1316
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:25,940
Microsoft does not care.

1317
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:32,540
I mean, after all, they have the triggers which make the controller vibrate to, as they

1318
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,780
put it, to wake up the other person because, yeah, also they're going to go comatose once

1319
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:37,780
they start chatting.

1320
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:38,780
We know how to wake them up.

1321
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,780
You know, in video chat.

1322
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,780
Bullshit, okay?

1323
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:46,060
That thing, they have one trigger for vibrating slowly, one trigger for vibrating, you know,

1324
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,460
at a more rapid pace.

1325
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,460
Come on.

1326
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,660
What do you think they made that for?

1327
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:51,660
Trance controller?

1328
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:56,740
You know, maybe our particular emailer here has just been lucky, quote, unquote, in what

1329
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,020
they've been seeing.

1330
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,900
Wonder Dog Harold in our chat room says, I've been playing tons of Uno and I haven't seen

1331
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,900
anything obscene.

1332
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,900
Exactly.

1333
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,100
I haven't, well, I played one game with Uno and I haven't, that wasn't a thing.

1334
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,180
I've seen like one person using a camera and that's it, you know, I just don't see any

1335
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,180
cameras on there.

1336
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,020
I think it's funny when I see cameras because usually they're pointing at really weird things

1337
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,500
like someone's cat, you know, just like fun stuff.

1338
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,980
Dude, we should put Shermie on the camera.

1339
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,100
My cat would, her nose would take up the whole thing.

1340
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,100
My cat's so fat.

1341
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,900
Well, I'm sorry to hear to our emailer that they're having to see all that crap because

1342
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,860
not everybody wants to see that, okay?

1343
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,700
I definitely use the 360's warrant system and seriously, if you see somebody shooting

1344
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,820
up drugs on the frickin', you know, even if they're trying to joke about it, just frickin'

1345
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,580
warrant, do the ultra-warn thing that notifies Microsoft.

1346
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,580
That's not cool.

1347
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:39,580
And why are people just like leading the games and stuff?

1348
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:44,380
If you see some like, you know, preteen masturbating on camera, why are people like kicking them

1349
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:48,020
out of the game or just, you know, saying, fuck this, I'm out of here, you know?

1350
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,420
I guess that's one option, host your own games.

1351
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,140
Look, boobies.

1352
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,780
That's a good option, host your own games and then you have control over booting people

1353
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,340
out when they're doing something stupid.

1354
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,140
So things to think about.

1355
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:07,900
We got an email from Bradley, who is a pretty awesome person, actually was talking about

1356
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:15,580
the guy at Kingdom Hearts Fan Club and was getting the word out regarding this petition

1357
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,580
going around.

1358
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,560
I actually think this is a pretty cool thing.

1359
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:26,800
They're talking about how Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix is coming out, but what's coming

1360
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:34,180
out with it is that Chain of Memories remake for the PS2, which we may not get.

1361
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:42,100
There's a petition going around now at KHInsider.com.

1362
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:49,700
The link there will say KH2FM plus COM, petition contact campaign.

1363
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:53,980
Just wanting to get the Chain of Memories remake released out here.

1364
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:59,860
It's showing interest to Sony, to Squeenix, actually, that gamers in the U.S. wants it.

1365
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,900
So I said I'd make a mention.

1366
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,060
Maybe it's something they could pack in with Kingdom Hearts 3 in the future?

1367
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,060
I don't know.

1368
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,060
A stretch?

1369
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,060
I don't know.

1370
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,940
I think they should do a $20 release and say, here you go, here's Chain of Memories.

1371
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:17,260
Oh, like when they release it as a budget game, maybe throw that in as a pack-in?

1372
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,260
Not necessarily that.

1373
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,940
I'm just saying maybe release it as a standalone budget game.

1374
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:21,940
That would be cool.

1375
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:22,940
I would pay for it.

1376
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:26,020
I've been playing Chain of Memories on my micro.

1377
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,020
I'd be interested to see.

1378
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,820
Chain of Memories is a pain in the ass to play on the micro, by the way.

1379
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,940
I'll be honest, I haven't really played Chain of Memories at all.

1380
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:35,020
I kind of skipped it, but I would check it out.

1381
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:41,260
I don't do a lot of gaming on Game Boy Advance, especially games of that length.

1382
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,260
I don't know.

1383
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,320
They're just more TV games for me, so I would definitely check it out if it was on PlayStation

1384
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,320
2.

1385
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,320
So I'd like to see that.

1386
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,320
I'll sign it.

1387
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,140
I'd just probably import it, but that's me.

1388
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,140
You know me.

1389
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,140
I've got one from Jeremy Todd 1.

1390
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,140
Hi.

1391
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,140
Hey, OLR.

1392
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,620
It's Jeremy Todd 1, like I just said.

1393
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,660
I haven't sent an email in for a while, so why don't I send one now?

1394
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,660
I don't know.

1395
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,660
Why don't you?

1396
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:06,540
He's been getting a lot of face time tonight with the comments and everything, but that's

1397
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,540
fine.

1398
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:11,660
Did you ever think that Microsoft and the makers of the games is ripping us off with

1399
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,780
the arcade games?

1400
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,460
I've been thinking about it, and seriously, it's a rip-off.

1401
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,900
An example is Uno.

1402
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:21,460
I bought Uno a week or two ago, and then today I went on Windows Live Messenger, the newest

1403
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:25,740
version of MSN Messenger, and then a friend wanted to play a game, so I went to the games

1404
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,860
list and saw Uno.

1405
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:31,020
I opened it up, and it was exactly the same as the 360 arcade version.

1406
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,660
It's the same freaking game for free.

1407
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,660
What the hell?

1408
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,620
So I paid five bucks for Uno, even though I can already play it for free with my friends

1409
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,900
using MSN, bah.

1410
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,300
And yes, I know I'm a sucker because I keep buying these games.

1411
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,580
My name is Jeremy Todd 1, and I have a problem.

1412
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,500
Yeah, but could you see your friend masturbating and shooting up drugs on MSN Messenger?

1413
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,500
I think not.

1414
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,500
That's plus.

1415
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,500
No, seriously.

1416
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:58,620
You know, you can play Zuma for free online, you can play Bejeweled for free online, yet

1417
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,580
we're suckers for these games anyway.

1418
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:05,160
They're pretty on the TV in a way that they're not in the little window in the computer,

1419
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,700
and there's something to be said about the achievements in voice chat, multiplayer, and

1420
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:09,700
all that crap.

1421
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,780
I don't know.

1422
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,100
We are suckers.

1423
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,720
But five bucks isn't that much either.

1424
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,720
It's really not.

1425
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,720
For a game.

1426
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,940
I could buy groceries with that, crackers and sardines for a week.

1427
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:23,020
Yeah, you could buy like two boxes of Hot Pockets.

1428
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,020
That's about it.

1429
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,020
Hot Pockets.

1430
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,020
Okay.

1431
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,020
Two more emails left.

1432
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,020
One's from Steven NZ.

1433
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:35,420
Hey everyone, love the show like always, and before I start I know that my grammar is not

1434
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,420
up to scratch, lol.

1435
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,420
Oh, wait.

1436
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,420
Hold on.

1437
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,420
Can I say this one comment on the last email real quick?

1438
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:40,420
No.

1439
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,420
No, I'm sorry.

1440
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,420
In chat, this is good.

1441
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,420
I'm kidding.

1442
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:46,020
Footy Monster says, Sky, it just makes it more accessible for everyone in the house.

1443
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,020
Interesting perspective.

1444
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,020
I just want to say that.

1445
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,020
In regards to, you know.

1446
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:54,580
To continue, I just wanted to ask you guys, which is better out of a Plasma or LCD TV

1447
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,740
for gaming?

1448
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:58,660
And we'll go ahead and ask that first question.

1449
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,780
I have an LCD widescreen and I like it.

1450
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:08,860
Plasma does have, well especially from having dealt with Plasma monitors for BeatMania,

1451
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:14,460
they did sort of die after a while of constant use.

1452
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:17,700
I was going to get into this in the FUs of the week.

1453
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,860
I had a, I think it's CRT, is that what they call the big boxes?

1454
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:28,420
I had a CRT, but I was forced to upgrade this week and I now have an LCD.

1455
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:29,700
It's pretty.

1456
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,140
I like LCD.

1457
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:33,340
I'm getting used to it still.

1458
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,380
The sound is bothering me on this new TV though.

1459
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,560
I can't get it just right like I had on the old one.

1460
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,560
So that's the only thing that's bothering me.

1461
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,560
But the picture's pretty.

1462
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,560
It's pretty.

1463
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,560
Loki, what about you?

1464
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,560
What do you have?

1465
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,560
You have an LCD, right?

1466
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,560
I have an LCD.

1467
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,380
I actually didn't, to go ahead and continue, and this next question is probably more for

1468
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:52,260
Loki, but I was wondering how long it would take for a stationary image to burn into an

1469
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:56,180
HDMI Plasma screen as I don't want to damage my new TV.

1470
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:01,780
I don't think Plasmas have the problem with burn-in anymore.

1471
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,780
Not if you get a new one.

1472
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:05,860
I remember the older ones having the issues with it.

1473
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:12,500
Yeah, I don't think, I don't think it's really an issue anymore, but apparently pretty quick

1474
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,620
from what I heard before.

1475
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:18,120
But I don't think, like I said, I think they've fixed that now.

1476
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,460
You know what I don't get, and I'll probably have some tech junkie sending me hate mail

1477
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:24,580
over this, but oh well, projection televisions.

1478
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,060
I don't like those at all.

1479
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,140
Like the ones that look weird, if you're looking at it like too high or too low, they don't

1480
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,140
look right.

1481
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,780
Like I don't get those TVs at all.

1482
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:34,260
I would never put one of those in my house, but I don't know.

1483
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:38,700
I'm sure that's going to incite some hate mail, but I'm not a fan personally.

1484
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,700
That's an opinion, people.

1485
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:45,500
Although I have to say, I saw my first non-video game example of burn-in yesterday.

1486
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,980
We went to the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum in San Francisco, and one of their

1487
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:53,900
screens had major burn-in, because they play the same thing over and over about blowing

1488
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,980
your cheeks up like Dizzy Gillespie.

1489
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:01,740
To continue with email, I'm just all over the place today.

1490
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:02,740
Last one comes from DMN.

1491
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:05,900
Yes, we saved you for last.

1492
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,780
Pet pet.

1493
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:14,140
All the same people managing to get on this show in different ways, calls, chats, emails.

1494
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:17,220
You know, if you're sitting at home going, why do all these people keep getting on the

1495
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,220
show?

1496
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,900
Well, you could send us an email and you could get on the show.

1497
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,780
Just make sure it's intelligent.

1498
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,780
Absolutely.

1499
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,780
Hey, OLR.

1500
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:26,820
It's always great to be able to listen to you guys.

1501
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:31,020
I appreciate the opinions to which I generally agree with you guys upon keep up the good

1502
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,020
work.

1503
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,660
I do write, however, regarding Sony.

1504
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:37,340
I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but in the past two console generations, we

1505
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:42,780
can all agree that Sony has prevailed over the other competitors, PS1 over the N64 and

1506
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:51,620
Saturn, not in Japan necessarily though, PS2 over the GameCube and Xbox and Dreamcast.

1507
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,500
This reminds me a lot of Nintendo back in the 80s and 90s when they dominated with the

1508
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,140
NES and Super NES.

1509
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:01,340
We cannot forget that Nintendo released a poorly made portable system after that that

1510
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:07,220
like Sony has with the PSP, and now they have gotten very much full of themselves when the

1511
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,700
next console was due out in N64 for Nintendo and PS3 now for Sony.

1512
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:17,980
Nintendo ended up being last in a pivotal generation for gaming with the 64.

1513
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:20,780
Nintendo reeled from that blow for quite a while and are now taking a step in the right

1514
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,860
direction and being innovative.

1515
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:25,460
Mind I bash Sony a lot, but I do not want to see them fail.

1516
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:30,460
I love the PS1 as well as the PS2, but I think that the fact that the two console generations

1517
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:35,060
of success have gone to their heads and going to send them further downhill.

1518
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:40,100
And the problem with that is that if the PS3 fails, Blu-ray is likely to and Sony will

1519
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,620
have nothing back to fall on.

1520
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:49,720
I hope Hirai, Stringer, and Kuraragi strongly think about their business plan for the PS3

1521
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,900
because it might be the last thing that Sony ever does.

1522
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,620
Thanks for reading and keep up the good work.

1523
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:58,540
It's an interesting comparison to make, but the one problem I have with it is that the

1524
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,620
PSP is no Virtual Boy.

1525
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:04,540
I think the PSP is a much better system than the Virtual Boy was.

1526
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,780
The Virtual Boy just had some fundamental problems with it.

1527
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,140
The PSP is just kind of a different thing.

1528
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:14,900
It's games and movies and music, but otherwise I certainly can get that whole the company

1529
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:19,180
is getting cocky using a format they shouldn't be using on the next console that's coming

1530
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:22,900
out with the whole cartridges and now Blu-ray.

1531
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,020
That's the interesting comparison.

1532
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:27,660
I don't know if I buy the whole PSP is on the same level as Virtual Boy so much.

1533
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:31,540
Remember, Kuraragi eats crayons and wears a helmet.

1534
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,540
Was that last email?

1535
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:33,540
That was it.

1536
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:37,100
And then you could send us an email as well, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1537
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,700
More news while we're running along this segment.

1538
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:42,100
We still have DDR previews to get to, so let's run through the next bit of news.

1539
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:47,900
Yes, and I'm sure this came as a first for everybody that heard it, but apparently there

1540
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:54,680
was a press release done by Bethesda saying, guess what?

1541
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:00,300
Elder Scrolls Oblivion is coming out on the PSP and PS3.

1542
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,300
That's news to me.

1543
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,860
I told you on this show well over there.

1544
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:07,860
Well, I actually have the exact show episode, thank you very much, because I did the research

1545
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,860
on that.

1546
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:09,860
Did you?

1547
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:14,180
We first mentioned that it was coming on the PlayStation 3, Episode 189, just to give you

1548
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,800
an... and that was mentioned about three months ago.

1549
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,780
That was mentioned as the launch title.

1550
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:26,120
We did mention the PSP version, which I believe was the same episode as the PlayStation 3 one,

1551
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,040
and also that the date would be April 07.

1552
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,860
We mentioned that back on Episode 196.

1553
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,860
Yeah, okay.

1554
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:33,860
Not clear at all.

1555
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:37,260
Yes, but we cannot confirm those rumors until it's on the cover of our magazine.

1556
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,460
Yeah, exactly.

1557
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:43,780
Once it gets posted to the... once it gets printed in the official PlayStation magazine,

1558
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:50,140
thank you very much, 1UP.com, yeah, which I might add, okay, there is an article in

1559
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:55,780
OPM that says, if any game is worth the price of a PlayStation 3, Oblivion is it.

1560
01:20:55,780 --> 01:21:03,020
Wow, that's retarded, because you can get Oblivion already on the Xbox 360, and yeah,

1561
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:06,580
from the screenshots it looks the same, so why would I buy a PlayStation 3?

1562
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:11,180
Well, isn't there supposed to be a new race in the PS3 version or something?

1563
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,180
I don't think so.

1564
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:14,380
Yeah, I thought I read something about that, that there's a new race in the PS3.

1565
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:15,380
What did I do?

1566
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:16,380
That's what I say about that.

1567
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,140
But anyways, so yeah, that's cute.

1568
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:24,700
Like two people in the chatroom almost simultaneously said, OLR should have a magazine.

1569
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:28,220
If you want to buy us out of our day job, sure.

1570
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,940
I have editorial experience and writing.

1571
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,780
Again, if you want to buy us out of our day job, sure, it's a tie-up too.

1572
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,780
Why?

1573
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:35,780
Jamie's in college for this.

1574
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:36,780
Give me a job.

1575
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,740
Like I said earlier in the show, and I'm going to repeat this every single episode until

1576
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:47,220
this actual story comes out somewhere else, full auto 2 on PSP in March.

1577
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:50,020
You heard it here first.

1578
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,020
You've got issues, Loki.

1579
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:57,500
Well, as also in regards to people who have issues, as I mentioned, we all know Kuraragi

1580
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:01,460
eats crayons, licks wall candy, wears a bicycle helmet.

1581
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,380
Now he has earned himself a leash.

1582
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:10,220
Yes, he has to be strapped to the playground so that he does not run off.

1583
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:20,900
When he was asked if the rival consoles will outstrip Sony's PS3, Kuraragi said, we do

1584
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,420
not care.

1585
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:28,920
He did though admit that they are struggling with the Blu-ray drive production, but they're

1586
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,140
wanting to resolve it.

1587
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:36,020
Now I have to say though that Phil Harrison, I think that he also has issues with crayons.

1588
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:42,180
He at least eats the wrappers on the crayons because when he was asked if they have a launch

1589
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:47,220
lineup yet, to quote, we're at a fluid time when games are in final QA, but not out of

1590
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,580
final QA, but we're close.

1591
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:55,980
So in other words, no, you don't have to give the special boy answer.

1592
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,300
Go back and eat your crayons.

1593
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,740
We should just send Kuraragi and Harrison like some crayolas.

1594
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:01,740
Do you want to?

1595
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,740
Yeah.

1596
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:03,740
Orange wins.

1597
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:04,740
Okay.

1598
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:05,740
Let's, let's figure out their address or whatever.

1599
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,740
We'll send them some.

1600
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:07,740
All right.

1601
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,740
Here's some crayons for you to eat.

1602
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:09,740
I think you ran out.

1603
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,740
Oh God.

1604
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:11,740
Stupid, stupid Sony.

1605
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:14,460
I don't think he would get it.

1606
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,380
I think he's too dumb for that stuff.

1607
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:20,580
They just take our crayons.

1608
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,580
Anyways.

1609
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:27,220
So, you know, kind of, you know, pretty obvious things, you know, Kuraragi being a retard

1610
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:31,940
and Final Fantasy banning more people, you know, it goes pretty much hand in hand as

1611
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:40,040
obvious news stories, but yeah, 3000 more people were banned for modding in what I can

1612
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:45,380
imagine is only the PC version and of course using third party tools and whatnot to do

1613
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,660
all sorts of hackster stuff.

1614
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:48,660
Yay.

1615
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:51,720
3300 people gone.

1616
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,780
Have a nice day.

1617
01:23:53,780 --> 01:24:00,880
Speaking of hacks and leaks, it's being said that Gears of War has been pirated and uploaded

1618
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,560
to Usenet.

1619
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,480
It's 7.2 gigs and 157 parts will take a long time to download.

1620
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:13,020
The thing is it takes so long to download that nobody really knows if this is legitimate

1621
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,020
or not.

1622
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,580
It could be a bunch of crap, but certainly interesting that this would have already hit

1623
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:20,100
the internet when the game is not supposed to be out for a month.

1624
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,100
Uh oh.

1625
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,100
That could be bad.

1626
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,900
I don't think it's legit from what I've heard so far.

1627
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,380
It could be a beta build or something.

1628
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:30,460
And to be honest, 7.2 gigs, that doesn't take that long to download on Usenet.

1629
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,460
Alright.

1630
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:34,460
Not that I would know or anything.

1631
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:40,380
Sorry, I got the giggles there for a second.

1632
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:44,860
Um, some interesting stuff though that was coming out.

1633
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:52,300
According to computers and video games, Tetsuya Mizuguchi has hinted that there is indeed

1634
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,900
a sequel to Rez coming.

1635
01:24:54,900 --> 01:25:00,580
And his comment was, I'm just thinking about that, I don't know if this is a Rez sequel

1636
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:07,860
or not, but that kind of synthesization concept, I'm feeling that we needed to make those kinds

1637
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:10,960
of things, new things with new technology.

1638
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,700
So possibly a new Rez game on next gen console?

1639
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,700
Vibrator 2.0.

1640
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,700
That would be pretty sweet.

1641
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,700
I'm looking forward to it.

1642
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,740
I need a tran- I mean, I would like a trans vib- hi!

1643
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:26,180
Look, the ferret.

1644
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:30,700
Interesting comment in chatroom from Footy Monster in regards to the Gears of War piracy

1645
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,700
story.

1646
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:36,100
It has happened before, Sky, Shenmue 2 on Dreamcast was four CDs and got leaked three

1647
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,820
weeks before the release date.

1648
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,340
Hmm.

1649
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,420
Interesting.

1650
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:47,020
Alright, well that's going to do it for the news here in this part A of Orange Lounge

1651
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:52,380
Radio but we have some more exciting stuff to get to and that would be our DDR previews.

1652
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,980
That's right, for the past few weeks we've been premiering new tracks from Dance Dance

1653
01:25:55,980 --> 01:26:01,620
Revolution Ultramix 4 as well as DDR Universe, going to be coming out for the Xbox and the

1654
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:04,220
Xbox 360 a little later this year.

1655
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:08,500
Tonight we've got four songs for you guys, two songs from DDR Ultramix 4 and two songs

1656
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,500
from DDR Universe.

1657
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:14,540
We're going to start tonight with a long version and this is a song that's going to be in DDR

1658
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:19,140
Universe and it's by a group who was originally in DDR Ultramix 2.

1659
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:22,580
It's one of the artists on the A Different Drum label and we're going to play the long

1660
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,700
version of the song for you guys tonight.

1661
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:29,740
The artist is nuropa who did the song Standing Still in Time in Ultramix 2 and they're going

1662
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:32,700
to be in DDR Universe with this song.

1663
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:39,700
It's the long version of beyond here and now, here on Orange Lounge Radio Power Previews.

1664
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:30,700
The thoughts are drifting far away, a memory of yesterday.

1665
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:36,700
Standing in our way, standing in our way.

1666
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:43,700
If I surrendered to your arms, wasn't captured by your charms.

1667
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:51,700
There'd be nothing left to say, nothing left to say.

1668
01:27:51,700 --> 01:28:05,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1669
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:21,700
Cause living in doubt is living without testimony, without refrain.

1670
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:54,700
And if we could fly tonight, a light like falling rain.

1671
01:28:54,700 --> 01:29:01,700
Nothing more to contain, nothing more to contain.

1672
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:08,700
Would you stay right by my side, a stolen heart of lovers' pride.

1673
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:15,700
I'll lead you to this side, lead you to this side.

1674
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:29,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1675
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:43,700
Cause living in doubt is living without testimony, without refrain.

1676
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:57,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1677
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:10,700
Cause living in doubt is living without testimony, without refrain.

1678
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:40,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1679
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:52,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1680
01:30:52,700 --> 01:31:12,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1681
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:19,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1682
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:29,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1683
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:39,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1684
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:49,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1685
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:59,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1686
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:09,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1687
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:19,700
Beyond here and now, I must reach somehow, to free a love I can't contain.

1688
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:39,700
Enjoy.

1689
01:32:39,700 --> 01:33:05,700
Can anyone stop the mechanical phase?

1690
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:11,700
We don't break inside.

1691
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:59,700
Can anyone stop the mechanical phase?
