Tonight, October 29th, 2006, Halo movie news and Halo 3 tidbits, Sony and UK importers go to war, and could custom character creation cause trouble for one gaming company?
Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there in the land of internet broadcasting and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
It is episode number 206 for this
October the 29th of 2006.
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know, gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.
I'm here to help you through that.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host over there in that corner, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I've taken a vow of silence for five seconds.
Great.
Then I'll introduce Loki.
I give up.
How are you doing?
Seriously, though, Jamie?
Head.
You have a little headache?
Little... I'm sorry.
It was a migraine earlier, but I feel a lot better now.
I'm very hyper.
Thanks for my coffee.
Oh, goody.
We have a hyper Jamie tonight.
That always makes for a fun show.
And you forgot.
What?
When are we going to set that thing on fire?
Mine!
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Hello.
How you doing?
Good.
How'd the move go?
It went good.
I'm just, you know, without internet until tomorrow.
That's got to stink.
Not really, because I just play... Well, actually, it's been so busy with unpacking, you know, last minute apartment stuff and all that stuff.
Really haven't had a chance to, like, sit down.
But I have been stealing my neighbor's wireless, but it only seems to work for about five minutes at a time.
So, you know, I get on there real quickly and
Read news and try to check my email, and that doesn't always work.
Have you tried to look at the shared folders on the network to see if there's porn anywhere?
Actually, her network is unsecured, but her shared folders are password protected.
Interesting.
So they got it halfway right.
Not that we endorse stealing Wi-Fi, but hey, if you're going to leave it open, people might use it.
All right.
We have a special guest with us tonight.
And this is nice because we actually have someone who I believe has never been on the program before.
So it's nice to have some new blood on the show once in a while.
So say hello, everyone, to Renee.
Yay.
Hi, I'm here.
How are you doing, Renee?
I'm good.
Don't be afraid to just put that mic right up to your mouth because they're not that sensitive, unfortunately.
All right.
Is this better?
Their emotions are sensitive, though, so don't make fun of them.
We just want to make sure they can all hear you.
All right.
So you've been a listener of Orange Launch for a little while, right?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, but you're here and you brought your box with you.
Yeah, I brought my box.
It has holes.
Very nice.
Now, kids on the internet who are going to read into that statement, just, you know, freaking...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I guess I like RPGs, rhythm and simulation type games, puzzles.
Alright, very cool.
The typical gamer girl.
Well, welcome to the program.
Thank you.
Now, something occurred to me this morning.
You actually, at one point, worked in the industry a little bit, didn't you?
I still do, actually.
You do?
Yes, I do.
Really?
I know you used to work at Konami a couple years ago.
I used to work at Konami.
That's where I actually started off.
I have been in the DDR community for a while, and that's when I started listening to Orange Lounge Radio because that's where all the cool kids went to.
They listened to Orange Lounge.
Love the endorsement.
Love it.
Thank you.
and I met Mike Ngo, also known as Asian Innovation.
Best rapper ever.
Not if you have to deal with him rapping at work, I'll tell you that.
No, but his drunken rap's pretty funny.
Oh my god, it is pretty funny.
And so I...
I met him and he said, you know, do you like video games?
I'm like, yeah.
Would you like to be a video game tester at Konami?
And he said, sure.
And so that's where I started off at Konami.
I started doing step data and then I moved into functionality QA testing.
And then I left QA to go pursue other things.
It happens, it happens.
You move on.
Yeah, and then actually I went back into the video game industry to go to LucasArts, and I was a QA tester there.
I did compliance testing, so that's like standards, first-party standards.
So, you know, testing to make sure that if we are developing a game for Microsoft or Sony that they have the right terminology or, you know, doesn't...
That's what I've heard from some people in the industry is that those companies are very strict on, you know, you have to call this button like the, you know, the Xbox 360 guide button is the official.
And like whenever you can't say, oh, that center silver glowing button or the silver button on the cover, it has to be the guide button.
Exactly.
And, you know, Microsoft and especially Sony, they're very stringent that you have to use...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Bad things happen, yeah.
That's interesting.
So there's a lot more that goes into putting a game on a multi-platform than you might think at first.
Oh, definitely.
I've seen games fail submission from going into production just because of the fact that the message that comes up when you unplug your controller wasn't correct.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's a lot of money too.
It's like at least a couple thousand each time you submit to Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo.
Wow.
Yes.
Interesting.
Well, thanks for the insight.
That's pretty awesome.
No problem.
And right now, I'm working at Perpetual Entertainment.
They haven't come up with any games yet, but the two games that they do have in development is Gods and Heroes, Rome Rising, and Star Trek Online.
Oh.
Star Trek Online.
Star Trek Online?
Yes.
Awesome.
Oh, that's something I might get into.
I'm the resident Trekkie.
I'm a closet Trekkie, a little bit.
Shh, don't tell anyone, but I like Treks.
So you're in the closet for some things, but out of the closet for others.
Yes.
I appreciate that.
I'm still kidnapping you to go see Warp 11.
DMN says that DNL is his hero.
Because your name in the online world is DNL.
Yes, it is.
DNL is DMN's hero.
That's a lot of initials.
We have alphabet soup going on here.
Alright, well, let's get into what we do at the top of every show and talk about our gaming week.
So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I played stuff, actually.
Really?
What'd you play?
Well, we had a barbecue at my place last night that somebody who was invited didn't show up for.
Sorry, other things, you know.
That's okay.
Busy boy.
I have to tease.
But we broke out the 360 and played... Okay, we had to see how awful the Sonic demo was.
Dan's actually pretty damn good at controlling that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That was pretty funny.
And then they put up the fear demo, but it was actually cool because Alex had been playing it on PC and was going through the differences between the PC and the Xbox 360.
In his opinion, he said it was actually pretty damn close.
And I have to say that I'm probably going to play fear if I don't get motion sick from it.
The demo did not make me that motion sick because first person shooters always do that to me.
I love, though, the very freaky elements.
Dan's like, okay, watch this.
This is about to get all Silent Hill.
Look!
I was like, ooh, blood.
I did hang out with Jamie this week outside the show, which was fun, and I got to see the walkthrough of the Fear demo as well, and it looked pretty neat.
I don't usually get into first-person shooters, but I like the whole freaky element that Fear has going on, and I kind of missed it on the PC.
I don't do a whole lot of gaming on the PC.
I apologize to our PC gamer fans.
There's a couple once in a while that'll make me look, but Fear's maybe something I'll look at on the console, for sure.
Well, apart from that, I actually played my first game.
Actually, I had Dan play it for me because I was sort of, my eyes hurt.
So he played Uno on my gamer tag, and my first game was one with a draw four.
So I was like, hey!
And then we saw somebody picking their nose on the webcam.
That's pretty tame compared to a lot of things I've heard that people are seeing on Uno webcams.
Nothing is as fun as Dan shit-talking, though.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm like, okay, but the voice acting sort of irritates me, and hearing the main song in English irritates me as well.
I was like, whoever they got to sing just can't.
I have a very bad problem with professional singers who are tone deaf, because that's what this lady sounded like.
And so that was really it for my gaming week.
I did try to play a little bit of Pirate King, but I had some computer issues, and I think I'm just not going to play that anymore.
It got kind of boring really fast.
It's a cute game, just boring.
Alex in our chatroom offers some advice.
He says, yeah, Jamie, it's been doing that to everyone.
You'll have to keep trying until it works in regards to Phantasy Star Universe.
It did that to me once, but then when I went back in, it worked.
Well, I'm thinking that I'm going to try to recreate my Ranger character.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
They were a very busy store, but for as busy as they were, I was noticing that they were trying to give everybody attention.
And that, to me, was just really kind of refreshing to see at a game store.
That's good advice for any employees that we might have that listen to this show, because I know we do have some employees of certain games, not just GameStop, but GameCrazy, all the other ones, too.
My hubby is no longer associated with GameStop, but that still doesn't mean I hate them.
All righty.
Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Die or Explode or just glitches in the game.
And yeah, it's really entertaining.
I played the Tony Hawk's Project 8 demo and I don't care for it one bit.
I mean, it's a great game, I'm sure.
It's just it's too technical now.
If you aren't really into Tony Hawk and you're picking this up the first time to go into it, you're going to have trouble doing a lot of stuff.
I felt an awful lot, whereas Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it was
It was fun to be able to pull off crazy stuff, and it wasn't too hard.
Now they're just giving you way too much damn control over stuff, and I think that'd be good if you know what you're doing, but if you don't know what you're doing, that's not really good.
I don't know.
It's pretty, though, so I don't know.
What was the other demo I was going to try?
I meant to try Rainbow Six, but I was waiting for...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We're waiting for Vice City Stories.
It's coming out on Tuesday, so we'll be able to switch out the games pretty soon.
So I'll have a full review of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories next week.
In the meantime, though, we're finishing up Liberty City Stories, and I am still kicking major ass in our killing spree at work.
So far, I'm ahead by, I think, 30 kills, which is awesome.
All right.
Anything else?
Um, no.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I just don't know.
For half the game?
For half the PSP version?
Well, it's just... I don't know.
It's okay, I guess.
But I have problems with some of the graphics in there.
Like, some of the tile sets that they have are hard to see.
Yeah.
And it really hurts my eyes to try to concentrate on it.
If they had an option to keep a specific tile set and just change the music or something, that would be great.
Well, you can do that in a different mode, but then you don't unlock new skins.
Thank you very much, Q Entertainment.
Alright, my gaming week, I played Phantasy Star Universe, now I can finally talk about it because I've played the commercial release, and so I feel a little better giving a full review of this game.
I like Phantasy Star Universe a lot because it's different from other MMOs because it's a little more action-oriented from what you're used to.
You know, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft have action elements, but in the end, I feel that Phantasy Star Universe is a lot more kind of action-oriented than the others.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But I agree with Jamie that whoever's singing that opening song is pretty bad.
But you know, a lot of animes have cheesy openings.
But literally, you play the game in chapters, and every chapter starts off with the same cheesy anime-ish opening.
It's not actual anime, but they use the in-game engine to do it.
But you'll see what I mean.
It's set up just like an anime.
But the funny thing is, when you beat a chapter, then it goes like...
Next time on Phantasy Star Universe.
It's really funny, so I love the way it's set up.
And I don't think the story's that bad.
The only thing I don't like is that there's odd loading in cutscenes.
Like, they don't load the cutscene all at once.
Like, they'll load half, and then there's a cutscene, and then they do another.
It's kind of weird.
So, it's got some weird loading issues, but you kind of get over that.
The other thing I think I don't... I don't... It doesn't settle well with me in Phantasy Star Universe is that it seems like the...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Let's see, the other game I want to talk about really quickly is Clubhouse Games for the DS, because I picked it up, but I haven't really talked about it on the show.
It's pretty cool, there's a lot, a lot of games on it, and I think that value alone makes it worth a purchase if you're into the casual games.
If you're not into casual games, you want something with more depth, I don't think there's going to be a whole lot here for you.
They try to make it a little longer...
Gameplay and kind of streamline it all together with things like mission mode and stamp mode.
But overall, it's nothing more than just an excuse to make you try every single game.
I was a little disappointed that online doesn't have certain games in it.
So be careful before you pick up the game.
Do some research online and see if the games you want to play online are even playable because they aren't all playable online.
So be careful.
Well, if you want, I have that music queued up.
Yeah, let me see.
If it'll come through, hopefully.
It should.
I'm starting the level over.
Oh, it's like a cheesy MIDI version of it.
I can hear it.
Yeah, it's like a cheesy MIDI version of it.
I guess for a phone it's not bad.
It'll pick up in a second.
Now, see, this makes me kind of go, why isn't this on the Xbox Live one?
This is like the best song in the game, and they got it on the frickin' cell phone, but they didn't get it on Xbox Live?
That's weird.
Oh, well.
Anyway...
Thank you, Jamie.
I think it turned out pretty nicely.
Yeah, for a cell phone game, that's not bad.
You know I hate cell phone games usually.
All right, Renee, how was your gaming week?
What kind of games have you been playing?
Well, besides the Hero Quest, I have been playing Clubhouse games as well.
I don't really have Wi-Fi set up at my house, and so I've been stealing Wi-Fi from the Metreon because I live in San Francisco.
And the only game that I've actually been able to play online is Darts.
and it's fine.
But I do understand that if there are some games that you do like and you definitely want to check out and see if you can play it online because I really was looking forward to playing Split or Spit.
Yeah, that was the one I wanted to do too.
Yeah, because I totally kill on that.
I'm awesome.
We should play again.
See, we should have totally battled but we can't because you can't play it on the internet.
Cry.
And I've also played LocoRoco.
I really love that game.
I've beat it like two times now.
And it's really cute.
Basically, it's made by SCEI or Sony Computer Entertainment International, which is Sony.
And basically, you play as a world and there's these little LocoRocos that are these little yellow blobs.
and you help them roll around and get rid of the mojos of the
are trying to invade the world, and that's basically it.
I guess the closest you can compare it to would be Katamari Damacy, but it's not really... It's kind of hard when you have these very original games to try and compare it to something else.
Definitely.
Probably people are going like, Phantasy Star Universe is like Zelda.
What the hell is he saying?
I don't know.
The whole sword slashing thing, I don't know.
It's the best thing I can name.
Yeah.
And the reason why I actually started playing LocoRoco again, because I basically beat it about a month ago, was because I had gone to visit the Sony store at the Metreon, a PlayStation store, and they had this little booth set up, and they had these little inflatable LocoRocos.
There was like
2 1-inch or 1-foot LocoRoco inflatables and then this one huge 3-foot one.
And so I walked up to one of the workers there and I said, Oh, are you guys selling these?
And he's like, No, actually, sorry.
And I made a little pouty face because that's what I do.
And so I asked him, Well, can I at least look at it?
And so he went behind the booth and he took the smaller one and he handed that to me.
and so as soon as I had it in my grasp I held on to it and I gave it a quick little hug and I said, oh it's so cute!
and like the girl I am.
And of course his heart melted and he's like, oh, well, do you want it?
And I'm like, of course.
And he's like, well, you can have it for free.
And here it is with her today.
It's here with me today.
And before he could say, I'm just kidding, I squeed and I just ran out.
So I'm very happy.
You ran away before you could take it back.
So that's why I started playing LocoRoco again.
Another game that I've been
Actually, right now, I just picked up Cooking Mama.
In the Bay Area, I've visited at least five different EBs.
And I've asked every single time, every time I've gone, and this is multiple occasions, I ask, do you guys have Cooking Mama?
And of course, as I've come to expect it, their answer is no.
And like the little fangirl of Nintendo DS games I am, I pout.
and walk away.
But today, when I came to visit Sacramento, I went to the EV Games over in Ardenwood and they had Cooking Mama and right now, Mama is telling me to poke my steak.
Wow, okay.
What kind of game is this?
Mama said.
This is some sick, sick twisted little game under the cutesy farce of a Cooking Mama title.
Hey, well, you know, whatever Mama wants, she gets.
Next we're going to have, like, Cooking Emeril, where he, like, yells out things while you're trying to cook.
Bam!
Yeah.
Mama wants you to come over here and poke my steak.
This is dirty.
Dirty, dirty.
I think I need to get that game.
Wow.
Maybe there's some girly thing.
I don't get it.
Oh, well, forget it.
I don't know.
All right.
Well, that's cool.
Well, great.
And I'm glad you brought... Can I give your local Rokodoll a hug?
Yes, you can.
You can.
Yay.
Here I go.
This is great radio, by the way.
If only you can see Rob now.
He has the biggest grin ever.
I know.
It's cute.
It's very cute.
I would have tried to steal one, too.
But, you know, I would have had to find a worker there that bats for my team.
And I don't know if there are any there.
So, well, it is San Francisco, for God's sake.
The official Sony store is still there at the Metreon, even though Sony sold it, right?
It is.
The Metreon itself.
Exactly.
I was at the Metreon last week.
That's right.
And how was your experience at the Metreon?
I saw Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D.
Oh, that's right.
And I had only had three hours of sleep and had been going all day.
So I actually fell asleep during the parts where they're handing out all the presents.
But right at the beginning, it's me, Chris, Megzi, and Mecco, who is our friend from Canada.
We're all trying to grab the snowflakes at the beginning of the movie.
And then me and Megzi are like, ooh, Jack.
Huh.
When they've had her up there for the different positions and everything.
So if you go, and I think it's actually playing through, I think through December.
If you go on to, actually just do a search for it, a website will pop up for Disney.
And you can actually order your tickets through Fandango, which I highly recommend because it's going to be sold out the whole time.
Especially this season, yeah.
Yeah, if you can see it anywhere, go see it.
Because it's seriously, it is worth the view.
Awesome.
All right.
And sitting in line was kind of fun, but not really.
Rob runs out of the room
Giddy like a little schoolgirl.
That's adorable.
In the meantime, the ferret will serenade everybody.
Oh, Rob's back.
You could have stayed gone.
This could have been a ferret show.
So I have shirts, so I don't know who wants what, but the white one seems a little more girly, so I'm going to give the white one to Jamie.
I wear black, though.
You want the black one?
What's the black one say?
The black one says, let's see.
If it's white, I won't wear it.
It says.
The Quadfather.
Okay, I'll take the white one.
Okay, then I'll give the black one to Loki because he's kind of dark too.
Dark and Gothic and Tragic and all that stuff.
Okay, and the Resident God.
Oh, this is cool.
Unplug and connect.
I have some mouse pads as well, so I'm going to give one to Renee as well.
Oh, thank you.
So there you go.
And then you guys get mouse pads too.
That's what I wanted.
Horizon Wireless Mouse Pad.
That's funny because I use Singular.
But I thought that was very nice.
Me too.
I thought that was very nice that our listeners kept this in mind there.
So thank you, folks.
And I'm also going to give Renee...
No problemo.
Have fun with that.
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping.
And to start us off, we are going to reenact the voicemails of the week this week.
And we have a very special message from our webmaster.
Let's take a listen.
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
This is Jason, and I have a very special and happy announcement from our webmaster.
Starting as of right now, you have a toll-free number that any of you are willing to use.
That number first off is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
That is 1-877-4263-657.
This is unfortunately only open to the United States and Canada, but the rest of you still have Skype, and the program will work at any time.
Free for you.
Have fun.
Alright, awesome.
So now we're almost like legitimate radio here.
We have our own 800 number, or 877 number, but same thing.
So we have a new toll-free number for you guys to use, and you can use that in interacting with our station when we take calls a little later in the program.
that number once again 877-GAME-OLR that's 877-426-3657 and because of the fact that we have the toll free number now we're thinking this might encourage folks to leave us voicemails so we are going to open up that segment we did a while back we're going to reopen up that segment for the voicemails of the week I'll let you know the topic a little later on in the program we'll take your calls on the new 800 number a little bit later the old 916 number still works for those of you in the area but I imagine most people probably aren't going to want to use that
Tonight marks the last week of our DDR previews.
New songs for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.
Too bad that today's last week.
We've been doing it for eight weeks.
We've got some new songs for you guys tonight.
Very excited about that.
Orange Lounge Radio has a brand new YouTube channel.
If you listened to last week's episode, I believe I threatened to put something up.
Oh, the Loki drunk thing, playing Mario Kart.
I threatened to put that up on YouTube.
I did, so check that out.
We are on YouTube under username Orange Lounge Radio and some folks have already found the videos and are
I'm sure that was an excellent quality scene.
I think it was formatted for the PSP.
It actually didn't come out that bad.
It actually came out pretty good.
I put some other stuff up there, too.
We have some news bits.
Remember the Oh, It's So Much Fun clip?
That's up there as well on YouTube.
But one of them, there's a Guitar Hero story that has DarkSakura and Loki in it, and it came out squished for some reason.
The video is squished.
It's letterboxed, but not really.
So I don't know what to do about that.
But it's all there if you folks want to check it out.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and of course lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation 3 and a lot of things being pulled out of the PlayStation 3 including the fact that they will not have a gamer score system.
Originally they were going to be putting out that entitlement system that everyone had a problem with because it kind of ripped off of the Xbox Live Achievement system.
Well, that's not going to happen according to Jack Trenton from Sony.
There's no gamer score system at all.
They just kind of ran out of time and
I didn't feel like putting it in there.
Very interesting there.
If you happen to be lucky enough to snag one of the first PlayStation 3s out there, one of the first 500,000 of course, you may be getting a copy of Talladega Nights on Blu-ray.
Because of course they really want to push that Blu-ray format with the Blu-ray drive being in the actual console.
So you get to enjoy that Will Ferrell comedy.
And it was actually pretty good.
Definitely worth it.
Kind of like the
Spider-Man 2
and their launch games have really kind of slimmed down a bit.
Sony's first party stuff, they've got Resistance Fall of Man, NBA 07, and Genji Days of Blade.
Those will all be launch titles.
Now, of course, Lair and Warhawk have been pushed to next year, so you won't see those for a while.
some other wonderful third party games so of course the exclusive Full Auto 2 will be coming out from Sega, Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, Ridge Racer 7 and of course they will also be getting versions of Fear, Fight Night Round 3 Elder Scrolls, Oblivion Blazing Angels, Call of Duty 3 Tony Hawk's Project 8 and all the big stuff so it's an interesting launch window I don't know so
Anywho, some stuff not Sony related.
Luminous Live.
Now, there's been, of course, a lot of controversy over the whole buy half of a game, purchase the rest of the game.
Later on, you know, kind of format.
Well, Mitsuguchi himself actually was interviewed by IGN.
And one of the questions they asked him was about that system.
And, of course, he supports it.
And basically, you know, saying, you know, Luminous, when it came out on the PSP, was more expensive.
And he feels that, I guess, you should pay the same price on the 360.
Well, thank you very much.
I'll remember that when you release any other Q Entertainment games, like the wonderful 99 Nights.
Glad I rushed out to buy that one.
I actually did rush out to buy 99 Nights because I loved the demo and everything.
I got mine for free.
Well, la-di-da, lucky you.
Glad I didn't spend my... I will say, though, I will not be buying Luminous Plus or Luminous 2.
Or any of your Extend Extra, you know, every Extend Extra.
Screw you, I'm not buying that crap either.
And I will buy them all because I'm a whore.
Actually, I probably won't get the PS2 one.
That is a little bit of overkill, but I do want Luminous 2, and I do want every Extend Extra, so what can I say?
Sorry.
Whatever.
Alright, um, so that pretty much does it for the big stories that we missed in that little bit of a gap.
Um, I want to do some comments from chat real fast, because the chat room's just lit up on some of this stuff.
JeremyTodd1 says, they ran out of time.
It's kind of interesting to know that the 360 came out a year earlier than PlayStation 3, and yet it has achievements, and so the PlayStation 3 had an extra year to get it, but they couldn't even get this simple feature?
I don't know, lack of achievements?
Is that going to kill the PS3?
I don't think it's a big deal.
I don't think that's really a big deal, but, um,
I think what's really interesting is some of the launch games not having online support.
That is a big deal right there, I think.
This just adds one of those little, you know, mouth protectors in Kudaragi's helmet.
You know, you're an achievement points whore, Loki.
Does this lower your opinion of Sony, or do you really care?
If anything, Microsoft has this wonderful achievement system to get me to buy games I normally probably wouldn't buy, or to rent games.
It kind of, you know...
I don't know, drives the market a little bit to get you to play more games.
So, I guess, I guess it would, you know, to be honest, it's not a real deal breaker for me, but I think the lack of online and certain games for them is a deal breaker for me.
And the other thing is,
They still haven't said what their online service has.
And they're saying it's free, but I don't see multiplayer gaming.
They showed a friends list.
Okay, friends list is free.
You get that free with Xbox Live.
But they still have not come out and said multiplayer gaming is free.
They have not said that yet.
So I'm thinking it's probably not free.
Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says, What about backwards memory card support for PlayStation 3?
Firebomba in our chat says, I thought it wasn't a Sony launch until Ridge Racer game was launched with it.
That's true.
It's got to be Ridge Racer.
Ridge Racer.
I had to, at least one more time.
I think this is interesting.
No, you didn't.
Pendro lends an interesting perspective here on the Luminous microtransactions debate.
If microtransactions total the price of a normal game, then that's kind of cool.
And as somebody had calculated above, if you buy Luminous and all the microtransactions, it's going to be about $35.
Well, let me put it this way.
It's...
It's either they release it on live and you have the option to buy these microtransactions or they just port it and throw it out on a CD or DVD and just put it in there and you get it all anyways.
It's all the same game, kind of like Luminous+.
What I didn't like about the whole thing is I felt they weren't very upfront about telling us what the game was not going to have.
I was very disappointed to find Versus Computer wasn't there, because that's kind of a way you could unlock skins in the original PSP version, so I kind of went there to try and unlock more skins, and you kind of couldn't do it.
So that was a little bit disappointing, and I didn't realize that feature was going to be gone, or, well, have one stage only.
I can understand downloading more skins, but I don't like downloading new features.
Like, I shouldn't have to buy two-player games.
You know what?
Blaze says they could have packaged Luminous as a real game and no one would be bitching.
True.
And you know what?
I mean, but I don't know.
It would have been a little less deceptive in my mind.
I don't know.
There's a certain element of deception with this whole thing.
Maybe I'm being overreactive.
I don't know.
Well, also, one thing to consider being in the video game industry is the production costs.
You know, they would have to not only go through rigorous testing to ensure that all of the content in the game follows Microsoft's strict rules, but also how much it would cost to send and...
Make the CDs and the manuals and things like that.
Otherwise, you could just buy it online.
True, but don't the online games go through a similar process?
Maybe it's not as rigid, but the way... Because remember when we had that story a couple weeks back about how Duke Nukem wasn't going to be on Xbox Live anytime soon because it would have to go through a process, and Microsoft supposedly has all these games in a queue waiting to go on the arcade?
So maybe there is still a process, but maybe it's less stringent than having to put the manual, do the clamshells, all that stuff.
Definitely.
So it would definitely cost less to go straight to live.
I think the reason why they did it on live to begin with was that so they could, it started off as a microtransactions thing.
It was like, oh, we could sell the Madonna skin and we could sell, you know, whatever other artist skins we're going to have.
And then it just turned into, hey, let's microtransaction for everything.
But there's some interesting perspectives.
I know we got an email on this too, so I'll save that for the mailbag.
That lends an interesting perspective as well.
Well, I'm sure we got more stories about it too.
I know there's other stuff this week, but I haven't looked at the show rules, so.
Well, good job prepping for tonight.
Well, like, for example, the whole Madden training videos thing, where they want you to buy that stuff.
I think people are starting to see, oh, microtransactions are working, then everyone's jumping on the bandwagon, but no one's getting it right.
It's kind of like one of those things, like back when motion sensing, ooh, motion sensing's cool, let's all release motion sensing stuff now, and
DarkSakura.com
and this is a feature in the video game Bully that GayGamer.net and another site, I believe it was GameBrink, captured videos of hot boy-on-boy action, basically, that the main character in the game, Jimmy Hopkins, can kiss boys as well as girls in the game.
A-boy.
There are several, you have to inspect them first and you'll have an action option for Kiss.
And they have the same animation as the females.
I don't know, I kind of sit back at this and I go...
and keep in mind, I'm gay myself, and I'm kind of looking at this going, this is a way bigger deal than it ought to be.
You know, I'm just kind of sitting here going, you know, when it was in The Sims, you know, it was just kind of like, okay, you know, hey, you can just do this if you want, or do this if you want.
But now it seems to be like, I don't know, like with all these sites reporting on it and all this stuff, I'm just kind of like, you guys are making a big deal out of what shouldn't, you know, it's just, hey, if you want to play the game like this, if you want to try this, you know.
Yeah, and Fable, you kind of did that too.
I don't know why this is such a... It's dumb, and you know why?
Because people are looking... They are... I swear to God, people are just making Rockstar the fucking scapegoat for everything.
They are, like, scrutinizing these games to find something wrong so they can go and sue them some more.
You know what?
But before you go and start doing that, be, you know, warned that they did put this content... You know, they brought it to the attention of the ERSRB when they were giving it a team rating, so you know what?
Fuck off, because this is all kosher.
People approved this for the teen rating, and that's it.
That's the game.
Play it.
At least he's not bashing skulls in or eating brains or something like that.
It's just fucking kissing.
That's all it is.
You know what?
Bicarious people, they're...
Tons of them in college and stuff.
Who gives a shit about just, you know, a fictional character who's not even real kissing a fictional character who's not even real who happens to be disguised as a male person.
I mean, these are, it's like saying, oh, you know, two puppets making out.
Oh, but they're male puppets, you know, so that's really wrong.
And nobody really cried out about the whole, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm not interested in you I'm interested in her
And nobody would have blinked an eye.
That's the other weird thing.
Nobody would have blinked an eye at that.
Because the vast majority, I hate to say it, the vast majority of gamers out there are, well, desperate young men who like to see hot lesbian action.
They should just do a game called Hot Lesbian Action.
It would sell.
It's called Dead or Alive Extreme.
Yeah, with independently moving boobs.
Where you sit on the other person's back and do... Sorry.
Never mind.
What were you going to say?
I was going to say Vice City Stories actually has one of the main characters is a transsexual.
And you don't know who it is, but one of them is a, you know, we learn later on, one of them is a tranny, and they have a major role in the game.
So it's like Rockstar's trying to, I don't know, push the boundaries of it.
I don't know, it's just, they're just, you know, writing diverse characters into their games.
What's wrong with that?
It's about time.
Hooray for them, even though these kind of aren't the games that really interest me.
But here's the thing.
I'm not going to go buy Bully just because it has this in it.
And I know other people who did, and I'm kind of like, you know it's a game, and this is like five seconds of a game.
I don't know.
I don't understand why you would go.
I mean, maybe they're trying to support the cause or whatever, which, okay, whatever.
But you know what, though?
I'd go see a movie that had...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
the film studios decided not to so Microsoft has issued a statement we're disappointed that Universal wanted to significantly renegotiate the financial points of the deal but the Halo franchise is hugely popular and our goal remains the same to find a partner that shares our passion and will creatively collaborate with us to best represent the story so it may happen but not anytime soon yeah I think this just means delays development hell yeah seriously oh well
You know what?
If it takes that much time to get it right, I would much rather see them delay it and get it right.
I mean, Halo is a game, so I think the games are what a lot of us are more excited about than the movie.
So Hollywood, take your time, just don't fuck it up.
Exactly.
Some interesting stuff, those rumored from Game Informers, they're saying that they have an insider that's let them know that Halo 3 is going to be getting a demo early next year.
and that's pretty much all we know right now is speculation there might be a Halo 3 demo early next year and that would make sense considering the supposed release date of Halo 3 being March or April of next year so yeah, duh but one of the interesting rumors I also read about Halo 3 demos they were saying they might charge for it that was a weird rumor, I read that too
I don't know, the only way I could see that being, I mean, well, you know, I guess they kind of already do that.
I mean, you can go to like Best Buy, I think, and buy a World of Warcraft 14-day trial for a couple bucks, you know, so I guess charging for demos isn't absolutely unheard of.
I think it does make a lot of people go, eh, but if people will pay it,
They're going to get away with it.
Especially, you know, if it's multiplayer and online demo, there's going to be a lot of people that are down for that.
So, you know, they probably do have room to get away with charging for that.
So, I don't know.
I guess we'll see.
What do you think?
Would you pay for a Halo 3 demo?
Yeah, probably.
Depends on how much it is.
It would be nice.
If it's like five bucks, I'm not paying for that.
But, you know, and also, I'm not really a good indicator of whether you'd pay for it or not because I would probably buy just to report on it for the show.
Yeah, man.
So...
You know... Okay, with the gamer in you, the regular gamer, non-journalist in you.
No.
Okay.
I wouldn't pay for it because, you know, to be honest, I never played it.
What if it... Now, here's a good idea that might justify that.
What if it came with those little pictures or themes or something, came with it, like to maybe sweeten the deal?
No.
No?
No, I wouldn't do that.
Here's what I would do.
I subscribe to Xbox Magazine, and let me get this straight.
Xbox Magazine, they used to come with demos that you couldn't find on Xbox Live.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Interesting comments from our chatroom.
Bandit says they should not charge for the demo, but should charge for the opportunity to play multiplayer in the demo.
Well, you know, because servers cost money to maintain, I guess, although no other multiplayer demos have been charged as of yet.
Let's see.
ShadowNextGen makes it very clear.
I'm not paying for a demo.
I ain't doing it.
Let's see.
VidPower says Halo 3 will be microtransactions.
Spend 400 points to get the sniper rifle.
Oh, I hope not.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but some people don't, you know.
And we're arbitrarily picking a weapon here.
We don't mean that that's actually going to happen, but I just hope they use caution in the microtransactions.
Maybe learning a little bit from this luminous backlash that's going on, so.
What about EA?
JeremyTodd1 has a very interesting point.
People who don't have their 360 connected to live will find the OXM's demo very useful.
Some people that play Halo don't play it on live because it does have a very thorough story mode in it, so something to think about.
Hmm.
Alright, anyway, one other story about the 360.
It's possible that there's going to be a dashboard update this week.
Now, this is speculation, but the speculation is coming from something Major Nelson said in his latest podcast.
He was talking to a developer on the show, and basically they were talking about the wireless communicator that's coming out very soon.
The wireless communicator is scheduled to come out October 31st.
Major Nelson said, you know, if you were to go to the store today and buy it, you can't use it until the fall upgrade to the dashboard.
Well, then that gets people thinking, okay, so he's saying that if, because this came out last week, this podcast,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They would need to put it out beforehand.
And I think it's about the time to do that anyways, because you're going to want to have the dashboard update ready for the 7th when the HD DVD player comes out.
You're going to want to have the update ready for when the PlayStation 3 comes out, so you have that 1080p and you can compete with them.
And whatever other fun stuff they want to throw in there.
More backwards compatibility, maybe.
You know, hey, maybe 2K.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Major Nelson seems like a really great guy I've never met him in person I will turn this dashboard update around if you do not behave but if you read those comments on his board and you know it's getting to him because he's had to make some changes I'd be so annoyed too alright, anyway
Well, something that may annoy other people in regards to Microsoft is that there's actually indications that they favor the live gold accounts above the platinum ones.
Well, over the silver?
Over the silver.
They should.
I'm paying for it.
Well, basically, they're saying that, especially for some of the...
The demos that are coming out, they're releasing them to the gold accounts before they're releasing them to the silver.
So you'll get the newer trailers, the newer demos, instead of having to wait for them because they're releasing them about a week or so afterwards.
That's fine.
I think that's perfect because it's more incentive to go play on gold.
And you know what?
Hey, it's free.
You can't complain if you're getting demos later on.
Just
If you're paying $50 for your year subscription, you should be getting your stuff.
Exactly.
You should have some sort of perks.
I'm surprised there hasn't really been much more other than this.
If not, then if you've got the silver, if you want them at the same time, they should do some sort of pay-by-download for...
I don't think they're going to come out of nowhere and say, surprise, you're going to have to pay for this.
They're going to piss more people off with that.
I think Sony is in a corner now where they have to make it free.
Didn't they have that comparison chart that got them in a lot of trouble?
That was comparing the Sony PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360.
And it was talking about like, hey, this comes with it.
It was basically trying to show the Xbox 360 actually costs more than the PlayStation 3.
It was that comparison.
And one of the things was they were talking about Play Online.
And it was free on PlayStation 3.
So I'm pretty sure it's going to be... Well, 15 a month, though, it's not that expensive.
You're technically paying about...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
If you think about it in the big picture, you really are not paying all that much for your subscription cost for live.
A couple quick comments in chat.
Blaze says, good, if I'm paying $50 a year, I should get it earlier.
JeremyTao1 says, I'd rather pay $50 a year for live, which has a lot more neat features than have the free PS3 online service and it having not as many features.
So interesting point there as well.
Pay for what you get.
ShadowNextGen agrees, $50 a year for Xbox Live is a great value.
All right.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Spiker, Brute Weapon
Spartan Laser that apparently tears vehicles apart, and a nail grenade which sticks in the walls and sends nails everywhere.
Brand new vehicles like the Mongoose, which is like a miniature ATV for two passengers with no weapons on it.
And then the one that people are hoping is mistranslated, but the Man Cannon, which launches players into the air, kind of like jump pads in Unreal or Quaker Arena.
Come step in suit, would you want to see my, uh, man-cannon?
Man-cannon.
It's not the man-cannon.
Some other interesting stuff is it's going to be coming out in three different SKUs.
The first one's game only, second one will be a collector's edition, and the third one is the legendary edition, which includes a replica of Master Chief's helmet, which is miniaturizing, so it's about cat size, so you can put it on your cat.
Or your man cannon.
Or man cannon.
It's also going to include documentaries, developer commentary, spin-off material like Red vs. Blue, Spark of Life, etc.
And all the cutscenes from Halo 1 through 3 in HD on a separate disc.
That's kind of cool.
And maybe a sneak peek at the Halo movie.
They're just speculating right now.
But lots of screenshots.
Looks very pretty.
Very, very pretty.
Of course, also coming out at the same time, not to be outdone by this leaked information...
OneUp had to mention that EGM will be also having some content on Halo 3.
Hey, hey, buy our magazine too.
Which, by the looks of their content, almost identical to what is in that Swedish magazine.
And, yeah, so that'll be coming.
In fact, they're going to be doing three weeks of coverage for Halo 3.
I thought usually you did that leading up to a game's release.
This is just randomly, hey, folks...
Three weeks of Halo 3 stuff.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, then... Okay.
That's... That's what you want to do.
That whole Man Cannon thing reminds me of when we were playing Fear last night.
And there's a weapon in there called the Penetrator.
So... If that gives you any indication.
So... Anyway.
Let's see.
PooEater says, Okay, so I'm guessing Man Cannon will be the next joke we run into the ground.
Most likely.
Most likely.
Um...
DJ Morpheus asks, hello, by the way, to our good buddy DJ Morpheus, honestly, who really looks at the developer extras?
I do!
It depends on the game.
I wouldn't buy this Halo 3 Uber Edition or whatever.
That's too much crap.
But I know people who love their Halo.
I might do that just to put a Halo helmet in my cube.
I don't really have a lot of game memorabilia, and that might be kind of fun.
I have to see what it looks like.
If it looks retarded, I'm not buying it.
Well, no, I actually love seeing all of the behind-the-scenes stuff.
Being in a design major myself, I love seeing all the artistic elements that go behind it.
But when we got the Toy Story box set, I was watching all the rendering errors first, before I was even watching the movies, because I'm just into all that kind of stuff.
I think it's great.
I like the ones in Shrek where the donkey turns into a big fuzzy porcupine looking thing.
Well, I personally wouldn't mind buying the extra stuff.
For Company of Heroes, which is an RTS game for the PC, they had just the regular edition and they had the special silver edition.
And with the special silver edition, it had a DVD with special features of how they...
made the storyline, the people they interviewed.
And it even came with little flashcards so that you can see what type of tanks you were fighting and what were some of their names and some of the weak spots and everything.
So it was pretty interesting.
Huh.
All right.
For those people who love World War II.
I'm getting the collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII so I can watch all the extras that are going to be there.
And yes, I probably will watch them because I'm sad.
This is another game I believe has a collector's edition.
Yes, Gears of War has a collector's edition coming out.
All right, well, Gears of War has gone gold-ish.
It has gone officially gold, too.
Yeah, it's gold.
Cliffy B says, my job as designer of Gears of War is, well, more or less done.
And that was coming from his official blog.
So it does look like Gears of War is going to make it out there on time.
Then it was actually, I think, later on that week also, it was also officially gold.
I believe Major Nelson kind of dropped that bomb a little later, I think, from what I'm reading.
Yeah, they're all ready to go.
Yeah, so the game will be out on time.
Doesn't look like any delays are going to happen unless something really screws up.
But that's exciting, because for the Halo 3 folks, this is a real hold-em-over game.
Even for non-Halo people, maybe this is something.
It's really cool looking.
Yeah, I hope there's a demo on Marketplace so I can check it out, because it looked really cool at E3, but watching and playing are two very, very different things.
I'm buying it.
Yeah, maybe I'll borrow yours then, check it out first.
I do think I won it, though, but, you know, after Final Fantasy XII is beaten.
I'm not getting Final Fantasy XII, though.
Look, I'm going to say this.
I've been a very, very good boy.
There is a... I'm okay to say this.
There is a pirated copy of Final Fantasy XII sitting on the floor of my living room right now, and I haven't touched it.
I'm being good, and I'm being a very good boy.
Well, it's kind of on someone else's PlayStation's hard drive, so I can't really give that away.
I'm not going to name names, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
So I'm tempted to take a camera.
Does somebody want to go with me late tomorrow?
I'll go with you if you get me a copy.
Take a video camera?
No.
I'm not going to buy you that game after you bashed on it on this program saying you hate the battle system.
You can kiss my butt.
Actually, actually, actually, actually, there are things about that game that make me want it, but I'm still so busy.
I really am getting into PSU now.
But you let me make a game on my memory card.
All right.
So I play over here.
GameStuffs have had Final Fantasy XII since like Friday, by the way.
Yeah, so did CompUSA, but they put them all out on the shelves from what I hear.
But I'm being good and I'm waiting.
Does somebody want to come?
We could take a video camera and do something for YouTube.
I'll go with you.
I don't know.
I've got to work on Tuesday.
We'll see.
I do too, but hey, staying up late might be fun.
Well, speaking of things, though, that are kind of messed up, you know, they broke a particular Walmart in Arkansas broke street date for Guitar Hero 2.
It was actually reported on.
So since it's actually supposed to be released on November 7th and Walmart said, uh-uh, we're releasing it now, then maybe your local Walmart will have it.
I'm actually sort of thinking about making a run by Walmart just because I have to play Trogdor.
If you know...
This is kind of a, well, it's a related story.
You know you can actually hack the demo to play the songs that were unlocked in the game.
Apparently they were on the demo disc.
Way to go, programmers!
You rock!
Keeping that content on disc.
This is how hot coffee happens.
Anyways, so yeah, apparently you can hack the demo.
I've got the demo at my house.
I have to see what's what.
I am actually passing on Guitar Hero 2 until the 360 version I sold my Guitar Hero today Wow I'm gonna probably get both
Well, as much as I really enjoy Red Octane and so forth, I actually really like Guitar Freaks, and that's where my allegiance goes to.
It goes to Konami, I'm sorry.
Oh, interesting.
Actually, I would say you're a little bit in the minority there.
A lot of people don't really prefer Guitar Freaks.
I think...
I think it just depends on your taste in music, too.
I mean, would you say you like to listen to that Japanese rock and the stuff that's usually in those games?
Oh, definitely.
That's probably why you prefer Guitar Freaks in the end.
It really is about the music.
I would not have been as excited about Guitar Hero 2 if it wasn't that they put bass mode in it, which I always do on Guitar Freaks.
Same here.
And the good thing, though, that I actually will still prefer Guitar Freaks over Guitar Hero 4 is because I've got Dromania and I've got a controller.
So it's all about putting it in session mode.
and just go and add it when you've got a group of people.
Too bad Keyboard Mania wouldn't link, but that's still... It's not that I dislike Guitar Hero.
I really do want to play Guitar Hero 2, but now is just such a bad time.
I really hate Christmas.
I love it and I hate it because they just avalanche the games on us at this period.
To some people, it's Yule.
Well, whatever.
You know what I mean.
Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate.
There's just this avalanche of games right now, and I can't play them all.
So I might as well just wait for the 360 version, which will have better graphics, widescreen, and maybe some extra songs.
Who knows?
We'll wait and see.
And I'll play it then.
You can come play at my house.
I will play.
Just like I played pinball this week.
I forgot to say in my gaming week.
I finally got to play one at the table.
Play Guns N' Roses.
That's right.
My, my, my, my show.
It was because I hate you, Michelle!
I don't hate Christmas.
Why are the chatters saying I hate Christmas?
I don't hate Christmas.
I hate you for saying I hate Christmas.
Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, the full track list has been out for a little bit now, including such wonderful tracks as we mentioned, Strong Bad, Trogdor, The Burninator, Homestar Runner, Flash Animation,
And if you happen to be a fan of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, you might recognize this band Deathlock as they perform their hit Thunder Horse.
And of course Deathlock is from Metalock plus the wonderful, very violent show on Adult Swim.
I think they had that on the E3 demo, didn't they?
I don't think so.
I remembered hearing it.
Anyways, some other stuff that they've got coming out.
I believe a new Freeze Pops, or another Freeze Pops song on there, Less Talk, More Rock.
Yay, Freeze Pop.
And some other stuff, and just a bunch of bands I've never heard of.
Honest Bob and the Factory to Deals Incentive.
Well, these are all, you know, the indie bands that they put in there, too, which is kind of cool.
So, yeah, it's pretty cool, and lots of tracks, so definitely worth picking up if you have a guitar.
I don't, so I won't.
Well, you can buy the bundle.
Why would I do that?
I just sold back the guitar.
I'm waiting for the 360 one.
Which is a big mistake.
Why did you announce the 360 one before the... Because we'd be so pissed if they announced it after.
You would be pissed and I would be pissed and we'd be on this show yelling and bitching.
But we'd buy it anyways.
Probably.
Alright, let's talk about... I almost said Guitar Freaks 2.
Guitar Hero 2 is coming out.
XBOX 360's Platinum Collection
99 Nights, Project Gotham Racing 3, Rumble Roses XX, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and Every Party.
Also, another Xbox 360 system is coming out.
It's kind of their, you know, they talked about this earlier, they're going to release kind of a reduced bundle in Japan.
So that is out this week, Xbox Live Vision making its debut as well.
For those of you holding out on the PlayStation 2, lots of fans still about the PS2.
In Japan, you can get LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.
Also coming out, Slaughter Up Core 9 and Gallop Racer Inbreed.
I'll leave it to you to figure out what that is.
But I want to point out, this one gives us this bot.
Horses with extra holds on their... That's how they translate it, folks.
Um...
Here it is, I'm looking here at this game, the Slaughter Upcore 9.
It looks like it has a go-go dancer on the front there.
It's a gambling simulator, so it has a little go-go girl on the front there.
Let's see, let me look at the box art here for this Gallop Racer.
Yeah, it looks like a, it says it right there on the box.
Look at this, here it is, right there in the studio.
Gallop Racer inbreed, right there, 10th anniversary.
I'm sorry, but is that like, is that kind of like... If you're an inbred horse, you probably are going to gallop everywhere.
Mississippi horse!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's a strategy game by Digital Kids.
And just look at the box.
Look at the box.
How could you not love that hamster?
I want the love hamster.
I'm going to import love hamster.
I have dwarf hamsters myself.
And if it's anything like real hamsters, then they probably should rename it to hamster inbreeding.
Because they multiply like crazy.
Now just keep in mind, please keep your love hamsters away from your man cannons, okay?
Boys and girls.
I appreciate that.
Well, my brain is now swimming from love hamsters.
Well, anyways, for our UK friends, we've got a number of things coming out.
On the first, we have Sam & Max Season 1, Culture Shock for PC.
On the third, a number of titles.
We have Curious George for PlayStation 2, Desperate Housewives for PC, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories on PSP.
On just about everything, Need for Speed, Carbon...
Neverwinter Nights 2 on PC, Rule of Rose on PlayStation 2, Scooby-Doo Who's Watching Who on a number of things, and SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the Krusty Krab.
Yeah.
And Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on PC.
A few things, though, that should be made a mention of.
Excuse me if I can never get my voice to work again.
I'll go ahead and list some of them for the 6th because there's actually the biggest one coming out will be Phantasy Star Universe coming out on the 6th of November other things to look forward to within the month actually after having played the demo is WWE Smackdown vs. Raw it's actually really good and if you want to beat everybody use Kane okay anyways I don't speak wrestling sorry yeah
Well, each week we like to talk about some stuff that you may not have heard yet.
And this week, of course, I'm going to start things off with a few date changes and a few price reductions like normal.
First off, the Xbox 360 games have dropped in price this week.
Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 dropped down to $49.99, which is good.
Battlefield 2 also dropped down to $49.99.
NCAA Football 07, which hasn't been out that long, dropped down to $49.99.
Burnout Revenge, which was already cheap to begin with, $29.99.
I think all Xbox 360 games should drop to $49.99, a more reasonable price, don't you?
Well, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, pretty awesome game, dropped down to $39.99, so that's pretty cool.
And of course, if you don't have a 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox Madden dropped down $39.99, and the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on PlayStation 2 and Xbox dropped down to $19.99, so not bad.
Now some date changes.
It's very interesting.
A few things you might not have heard yet, including some of the Wii launch titles have been delayed.
It's quite interesting.
For example, Blazing Angels on the Wii has been delayed to December 6th.
Far Cry Instinct's Predator has been delayed to next year, January 16th, which is very interesting.
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Wii has been delayed to December 7th.
Call of Duty 3 has also been delayed to December 7th.
And Marvel Ultimate Alliance, December 7th.
So...
Activision, something happened there because all their titles got delayed.
If you're looking for Elder Scrolls Oblivion on the PS3, I mentioned it was a launch title, but of course that's the launch window and not launch day.
December 12th, it's already starting its move into March, kind of like the 360 version was.
Yeah.
It's slowly sneaking away.
Anyways, some other games, though, you might also be looking forward to, especially not on the PlayStation 3, but on the 360.
Fusion Frenzy 2 won't be coming out this year.
It's coming out January 16th of next year.
Some games also announced Warriors on the PSP.
It's coming out December 13th.
Silent Hill Origins also been delayed to next year.
So you won't be seeing that until at least January 17th.
I want to say I read somewhere there's some major reworking going on there, which is why it was delayed.
That date has been bouncing around this week like crazy.
It was in March at one time this week.
It's nuts.
One point, though, about that is that if you go in the Akira Yamaoka community on LiveJournal, there's actually previews to some of the tracks in the game.
Okay.
And then finally, two other titles were announced from Buena Vista Interactive that you haven't heard about yet on systems.
Pirates of the Caribbean 3, of course, that's a working title.
It's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3, the Wii, Xbox 360, DS, and PSP May 16th of next year.
And, God, why are they making this game?
High School Musical The Game is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and the DS on July 11th.
So those are your dates for the week for exclusive stuff.
Real quickly, Footy Monsters, Diane in chat here wants to know, you know the release date for Splinter Cell Double Agent on PS2?
Splinter Cell Double Agent?
For the US?
PS2, yeah.
That was actually last week.
For PS2?
Yeah, it came out a week after the 360.
So that was last week.
Anywho, um, some other stuff, of course, you know, the releases for this week, um, we've got lots of big stuff.
I mean, this is kind of getting into the whole, um, you know, kind of end of the year push.
Um, Need for Speed Carbon on pretty much every single system out there except for the PlayStation 3 and Wii, because those are coming out a little bit later.
Um, of course, you've got Children of Mana on the DS, Pokemon Ranger on the DS, um,
Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII
Death Junior, Root of Evil, Killzone Liberation, Mind Quiz, and Power Stone Collection.
So that's a little slice of the stuff coming out.
Not everything, of course.
Yeah.
As far as things coming out much later, it was actually listed in the official Xbox 360 magazine that Bethesda is working on a game that uses the Unreal Engine 3 called Rogue Warrior.
It's also going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 3.
It's a multiplayer anti-terrorism game.
It's actually based on books by Richard Marcinko.
I think that's how it's pronounced.
and being developed by Zombie Studios.
They worked on Shadow Ops prior.
It's supposed to have some different modes, including one that generates a map based on what the teams decide on beforehand, like a cooperative map.
And you're the only one who will know the territory you start off in.
It also has a four-player co-op mode, 24 and other multiplayer modes.
Sounds pretty cool, actually.
if you like, you know, those types of games.
All right.
Well, we have a... I like Bethesda.
Yeah, I like Bethesda, too.
We have a series of oopsie things to report.
There's been a lot of oopsies.
Remember last week, the big, big oopsie with Bubble Bobble on the DS?
Oopsie.
And you can't get past stage 30?
Okay, well, nothing quite that major, but a couple big oopsies nonetheless.
Somebody noticed just now that, I believe this was on NeoGAF, those big forums over there,
Notice that the GameCube Killer7 box, if you look at the back, it points you to a website, www.killer7.com.
Killer7.com is a porno site.
The correct site should have been killer-7.com.
Are you going to killer7.com right now, Loki?
No, I'm not.
Someone is sending me a private message.
Because I saw him reach for the keyboard as I said that.
I thought he was going to check that out right now.
Well, certainly a lot of free publicity for that porno site this week, thanks to Capcom's proofreading team.
Good job, Capcom.
Anyway, some other funny oopsies have been going on, like in Glasgow, because apparently Wii's out over there, according to some of their clocks, which have been incorrectly set up.
It's their countdown clocks that they have for the Wii, and so now it's just saying out now.
But, I don't know, big deal.
So someone messed up a clock.
Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing to put on the internet, you know, like, hey, somebody can't set a clock, that's gaming news.
But I guess some folks are curious what it's going to look like when all is said and done.
A couple website oopsies going on right now.
Walmart was listing the PlayStation 3 for $299.82.
Keep in mind the PlayStation 3 is supposed to cost at least $4.99 for the low one, $5.99 for the high one.
Well, you know they do sell a lot of stuff as lost leaders.
Yeah, but I don't think it's supposed to be that low.
I think someone made a boo-boo.
Rolling back prices.
That sounds like the Xbox 360 price right there.
$299.82.
Also, a late-breaking oopsie.
We got posted to our forums just before the show, I believe.
TigerClaw pointed this out.
CompUSA was listing a Nintendo Wii for $1,100.
And I thought the Wii was supposed to be the affordable system.
Must be Canadian.
Needless to say, someone's getting fired!
All right.
Maybe we should make this oopsie thing a regular segment.
There certainly are enough mistakes going on out there.
I don't know what to say about that.
Apparently the Wii thing is still up.
Tiger Claws posted a link in our chat right now.
Let me go ahead and do that and I'll paste that in right now.
I know this is wonderful radio here.
Oh yeah, there it is.
Wii console, $1,119.06.
Someone made a little bit of a mistake there.
Good job, CompUSA.
Leaking games early, selling Wii's for... That's gotta be one hell of a Wii.
It better, like, have other Wii attachments with it.
Like the Madden Cannon.
And the Penetrator.
And the Love Hamster?
Every week, DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and all around, and she finds a website appropriate to share with y'all.
Appropriate.
And she calls, or maybe, is it Killer7.com, your website of the week this week?
No.
Okay.
And she's got a website of the week, and she's going to share it with you right now.
Today's website of the week is The Misadventures of Hello Cthulhu.
It's a really messed up little webcomic that one of my friends in the Doctor Who fandom linked to me that's about Cthulhu being dropped in the Hello Kitty universe.
Yes, the Elder God Cthulhu in the Hello Kitty universe with ribbons on his tentacles.
It's very funny and I recommend everybody go read it all the way through because trust me, it sort of has continuity but not really because it's just messed up.
Especially when he turns...
I haven't seen Bats Maru yet.
I've seen Pom Pom Purin.
And I've also seen the Tentacle Monster version of Pom Pom Purin 2.
My favorite part is when they go to the island and are attacked by the cheese grater monster.
It's really random.
If you liked Kawaii Knot, Hello Cthulhu is even worse.
Hey, before we get to the next story, I want to point out that NintendoManiac64 in our chat room noticed that that amount that they were charging for the Wii on CompUSA, $1,119, is the release date of the Wii, 11-19.
Good job.
Good eyes.
So somebody just screwed up when putting things in their database and put the date where the price goes.
Oops!
And caused panic amongst game bloggers everywhere.
What can you do?
Well, there is a little bit more news that I have for everybody.
Something that may interest somebody in the room, except I think she already knows about it, is the LocoRoco Halloween demo.
It also comes with a firmware update for the PSP, bringing it to 2.82.
Excuse me.
Um...
Basically, according to our expert friends at Sony, who, again, expert is used very loosely, it has the extras, things that are changed.
We think we've covered all this before.
But you don't really need it to play the LocoRoco demo.
You can still play it with 2.71 firmware.
Okay.
For European gamers, you can download the firmware update from yourpsp.com or you can also use the US one.
It doesn't really matter.
The LocoRoco demo is available online.
It also has a US and European version.
I wonder if anyone's going to dress up as a LocoRoco for Halloween.
That would be kind of cute.
I'm not.
I'm going to be a pirate.
I don't have a costume picked out yet.
I never pick out my costume until the day of Halloween, actually.
I've got this long wig.
I'm going to be a pirate.
Arr.
Okay, by the way, I made a mistake.
It was actually Blackboy who noticed it first that the CompUSA screw-up.
Nintendo Maniac was just the first to type it in all caps, so I saw it.
Not to encourage you all in chat to type in all caps, damn you.
Alright, it's getting towards the end of this segment, so that means it's time to hear a little bit of new DDR music.
And for the past eight weeks, if you can believe it, we've been premiering new songs from Dance Dance Revolution Universe, which will be coming out on the Xbox 360, sounds like next year, and DDR Ultramix 4, which I believe is next month?
It's in November?
I believe is when it's coming out?
Right, Loki?
Ultramix 4 is in November still?
Yes, Ultramix 4 is November 15th.
Last we heard.
I think the bundle's delayed a week, which is weird.
They did the same thing with Supernova.
I don't know why.
Maybe.
Can't make the pads.
All right, well, anyway, we have some new songs for you guys, so you can check out some of the songs you'll be able to dance to in these new games.
We're going to start off this last batch of songs with a song from DDR Universe.
It's a group called Geomancer, and the song is called Hydrasound, and it's going to start off our previews tonight.
Here on Orange Lounge Radio
and many more.
Thanks for watching!
And that was Hydrasound by Geomancer here on the DDR Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio, coming soon to DDR Universe.
All right, let's go into our next song.
It's from DDR Ultramix 4.
It's by an artist called Steve Porter, and the song is called Sockham, and it's coming to DDR Ultramix 4.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
Sockham by Steve Porter here on Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks coming soon to DDR Ultramix 4 Alright, we're getting down to the end here and we have our last song we're going to preview here from DDR Universe and it's from an artist you might have recognized from the Ultramix series because this artist showed up in quite a few of the games or if is has a song in DDR Universe and it's called The Hop and you're going to hear it right now on the DDR Sneak Peeks here on Orange Lounge Radio
Or if it is, they're with The Hop, coming soon to DDR Universe.
And now, the very last song of our DDR previews.
And before we get to this, I just want to say a big thanks to Konami of Hawaii for giving us the opportunity to give you guys something a little bit special here, obviously.
If you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, you know that we've always been long-time supporters of music-based games, and of course DDR being at the forefront of that.
And it's very cool that Konami...
I made it up!
This band's a lot less emo.
They're on the different drum label.
And this is a song called Free, the Liberation Mix, and it's coming to DDR Ultramix 4.
Enjoy.
Blue October, UK.
Never uttered a word, if I thought out loud in the messages I was always alone, in a world, just the universe and me Never uttered a word, if I thought out loud in the messages We, and I knew this day would come
Breathe, Liberation Mix by Blue October UK here on Orange Lounge Radio, the last song in our DDR sneak peeks.
And that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
So did you guys like those songs?
I thought it was pretty good.
I liked that last one especially.
It was kind of light and airy and trancy.
It was a little too trancy.
Yeah, you're not a big trance fan, huh?
But you said you liked the one, what did we play in there?
The Steve Porter one.
You said you liked that one, yes?
DarkSakura?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, as far as the DDR sneak previews, I like the Orifice one.
You know, I've actually met Zonk live, and actually, Orifice guy is a producer for Zonk.
So, yeah, I really like the Orifice one.
It was really kind of different.
Yeah, you know, I have to admit, the songs in the previous games weren't so hot to me, but that one I liked.
I can see myself really playing that one.
And I like Zonk a lot.
I like their remix of...
Love this feeling that they did previously.
So, you know, I know it was kind of a controversial song in the community.
Some folks were like, what did they do that song?
But I liked it.
So, pretty cool.
All right, well, we are going to say goodbye for now.
But we'll be back in a little bit with Orange Launch Radio Part B. Those of you guys listening live here on Sunday night on orangelaunchradio.com or if you're listening to our syndicated run on allgames.com, we'll be right back in a little bit.
But for those of you guys listening on the podcast...
You have to wait a couple days.
Sorry about that, but it's just the way we do things.
And we'll be back with Part B right after this.
