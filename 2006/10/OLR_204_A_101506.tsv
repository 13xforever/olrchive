14059	15539	Tonight, October 15th, 2006.
16980	19040	More details on the E3 makeover.
19340	22361	PlayStation 3 and Wii's are pre-ordered around the nation.
22781	26062	And what are the annoying things about the next game generation?
27722	32463	Orange Lounge Radio.
32883	38984	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
39265	41025	We are that internet radio program.
41610	42231	DarkSakura.com
70515	70995	Oh, that's right.
71015	71295	That's right.
71315	77577	You were... I remember now, so... And then I fell into a coma for eight hours because I have a sinus infection.
77817	78637	I'm sorry to hear that.
78917	79917	So sick Jamie's back.
80477	85079	Those folks that have been listening to the podcast for a long time know that Jamie was sick for a while.
85619	87399	Yeah, and it started from a sinus infection.
87459	90800	So my doctors are like, okay, pick your antibiotic.
91180	93021	I'm like, I get to choose?
94521	98782	So I'm on erythromycin, which hates my whole digestive system.
99580	102202	I prefer C-Pro, just five tablets, but that's just me.
102603	103784	Anyway, sorry, we're not the drug show.
104004	104864	We're Orange Lounge Radio.
104905	105545	Aren't we, Loki?
105625	106786	Techmaster Loki is also here.
107086	107367	Yes.
107687	108347	Yes, how you doing?
108768	109829	Yes, we're not the drug show.
110729	111390	I like your shirt.
111430	113011	You have a Me and Mike Katamari shirt on.
113292	113532	Yes.
113772	115393	You know, I never played that on PSP.
115433	116274	I just kind of missed it.
116754	118296	I was looking forward to it, and then I was kind of like, eh.
118496	119737	I played it a little bit and got bored.
120057	120337	Did you?
120538	120958	Really quick.
121078	123420	Was it just not the same on the little screen?
124361	125822	The lack of a second analog stick.
126138	128100	Cramps my hand up very badly.
128500	142511	And so it was just like kind of Metroid Prime Hunter Syndrome where, you know, you just have to stop playing because it hurts your hand and it's just not, I don't know, it's like trying to control a car with a brick or something instead of a steering wheel.
142711	143011	I don't know.
143351	145593	I actually got the urge to play Katamari Damacy yesterday.
145953	150357	I was lying on the couch kind of just, you know, having one of those lazy days where I'm like, I'm not going to move from this spot.
150737	154860	And then I'm looking over at my game collection, which is, you know, kind of next to the TV, and then I'm like,
155868	156949	I want to roll over things.
157069	158350	I want to play Katamari Damacy.
161473	163355	There's something very stress relieving about that game.
163395	163996	I can't explain it.
164156	166538	We get that feeling every day during work.
166719	168280	That's why we have to have our killing breaks.
168440	168821	I see.
169181	170562	Hence the Liberty City stories.
170742	171223	Yes.
171243	179051	We'll get to your gaming week in just a minute, but I do want to introduce an old favorite of ours that's sitting here tonight on the ground hacking something on the computer over there.
179351	180412	Say hello to Miklatov.
181289	181950	Don't say train.
181970	183070	What's wrong with trains?
183111	183451	Because...
209741	210401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
239658	242019	My Michelle rocks, just for the record.
242059	242199	Yeah.
264412	264672	No!
265393	274580	And I made myself an Xbox Live account, and so I have my own gamertag now.
275701	277402	After all this time, you finally made your own damn account.
277422	278303	Because of the PSU demo.
278523	278743	Yeah.
279424	280985	Which I haven't played yet, I just downloaded it.
281205	281825	Okay.
282106	285788	But for anyone who wants to know, oh my god, I'm going to regret this.
286409	288090	Just go to the forums and look it up.
288751	292013	Yeah, go to the forums and look it up, because I posted it on the gamertag.
292113	294135	See, then it's free advertisement for the forums.
295742	312172	and then this doesn't have to do with anything about well actually playing a game but it made me think of it since you guys were talking about Katamari is I had a dream on like Thursday night that I was rolling a Katamari over my work you remember the last time I had dreams about that right?
312732	314433	I left that job really?
314493	323359	to another one makes me think of that ad that was on I think it was for like a bank or a credit card or something that showed the Katamari rolling down the hills of San Francisco I mean it
323922	329183	The ad agency denied it was inspired by Katamari, but that's what any gamer would think about when they see that commercial.
329203	330524	It's just, oh, haha, Katamari.
331984	338786	Actually, I still have the parody that I made from when I worked at the student loan place, so I'll post it up in the chat room.
341487	343367	Loki, how was your gaming week?
344588	345148	It was okay.
346008	346748	What did I play?
346968	347849	I didn't play a whole lot.
348909	351010	More Saints Row, because that game is really fun.
352330	352710	I finally...
353035	369164	I finally stole a Titan, which is an armored car with money in it, and I have been performing the wonderful money duping glitch that's in the game, where you can basically blow this car up over and over, collecting the money in it, and buying it over again.
369524	369964	Fun stuff.
370784	377928	Grand Theft Auto, of course, Liberty City Stories, still waiting for Vice City Stories, only a few more weeks, a few more weeks, then we can switch games, finally.
378529	378789	And then...
380345	381846	Other than that, really not a whole lot.
381866	391929	I was meaning to set up my PlayStation 2 and play some games on that, but I need to buy a VGA cable for it so I can hook it up to my computer because unfortunately Nelly wants to hog the TV with Zuma.
392690	393550	But she's not a gamer.
394430	394970	No, not at all.
395390	396731	She's a single gamer, I guess.
398051	402533	So yeah, unfortunately I can't really play the games on there, so I have to wait for that.
402593	404954	Plus I'm also packing because I'm moving next week, so...
406083	408624	That kind of puts a damper on playing games and stuff.
408864	412325	But I did play a little bit of Dig Dug, which is kind of neat because that came out this week.
413245	413565	I don't know.
413805	415265	It's just Dig Dug.
415285	416406	I mean, what do you expect?
416826	420827	And then tried a little bit more of Need for Speed Carbon.
421227	422627	The demo is pretty awesome, actually.
422847	424388	I'm pretty impressed with it so far.
424888	429109	So you may need to check that out once the game finally makes its way out here.
429839	442409	Um, then of course, I know there's some, I tried playing the multiplayer demo of Splinter Cell, uh, Double Agent, but unfortunately at the time I was torrenting a bunch of stuff and Xbox Live didn't like that too much.
442649	445011	So, I'll have to try that next week.
446773	448394	I think that's about all I played, yeah.
449535	449815	All right.
450936	453537	My gaming week, a lot of the old standbys.
453597	457399	I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, a little more progress in Enchanted Arms.
458579	460020	New stuff I checked out this week, though.
460060	464522	I downloaded Dig Dug when it came out on Wednesday.
464622	469704	Out of the old Namco classics that have been released recently, Pac-Man and Galaga,
470148	470469	DiggDugg
483917	485718	So, you know, it was cool.
485858	487799	It was kind of, you know, a little bit of memories.
488679	502266	I have to admit, though, I'm a little bit disappointed, as I'm sure most Xbox fans are feeling, is that it seems like we just had nothing but a barrage over the past couple months of rehashed old classic games, and we're really looking forward to some of the new stuff, you know, Luminous.
502779	505681	Castle Crashers, and all this other stuff that's supposed to be coming out.
506401	510443	And I believe I heard somewhere that Xbox has their stuff.
510463	521089	I want to say when we did the story last week about Duke Nukem, and the possibilities of that coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, that they had said that Xbox Live has its calendar full through the end of the year, or something like that.
521129	523690	And it's kind of like, why aren't we seeing releases every week then?
523990	525611	Or why aren't we seeing more homegrown stuff?
525991	528673	Why can't they do releases more than one game a week?
529593	530534	Is that so difficult?
531058	531658	I mean, seriously.
531798	532098	I don't know.
532518	534799	But yeah, so, you know, Dig Dug, yay.
534999	536760	Another classic game, not so yay.
536840	540461	But for the value of $5, can't really complain.
540541	545142	It's, you know, got really easy achievements if you're into hoarding up the achievements.
545682	549483	And unfortunately, no multiplayer or any of that stuff.
549583	551344	But, you know, it's Dig Dug.
551904	559226	Either you remember it from your childhood and you love it, or you'll download the demo and think, oh, another 1980s game that I may or may not buy, depending on
559830	562331	How much nostalgia means to me.
562411	566353	Going from something very nostalgic to something very new, it's kind of nostalgic in a way.
566393	573736	I also played Mortal Kombat Armageddon on PlayStation 2, which is, you know, the clusterfuck Mortal Kombat, so to speak.
573796	581859	It's, you know, every single character was ever in a Mortal Kombat game except for like one obscure, you know, you don't even remember this chick.
582159	584360	But like most, every single character's in it, yeah?
584380	584460	Yeah.
585131	587313	Did you try the Mario Kart type game?
587433	587954	I did.
588054	589796	The Motor Combat or whatever it's called.
590436	591157	It's cheesy.
591397	594941	I mean, don't expect... It's not a racing game, okay?
595001	597043	Mortal Kombat Armageddon was not designed to be a racing game.
597083	599345	It's definitely something extra they tacked on.
600057	602518	It's cute, it's fun, but it'll get old fast.
629980	630380	Thanks for watching!
641351	641851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
666471	667611	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
694362	699226	Well, the last one technically was Shell and Monks, so that wasn't really a Mortal Kombat game.
699426	700346	No, no, not that one.
700406	701047	The one before it.
701067	701587	Deception.
701667	702408	Deception, yeah.
702548	704129	I actually think I kind of preferred that one.
704189	706090	So what if it didn't have the big cluster of characters?
706430	708772	It had enough to keep the game fresh and moving.
710780	715222	But if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, this is definitely fan service.
715282	719044	I would say the other disappointing thing about this game is I'm kind of surprised it's not next-gen.
720185	723626	I think if they went next-gen with it, then maybe they could have squeezed all that stuff into it.
723886	726768	Of course, it probably would have been in development for another year, but, you know, I don't know.
727668	728709	They're probably working on one.
728749	729509	It's not bad.
730049	735812	For a fighting game, you know, considering the amount of variety you get with this game, you know, it's actually pretty good.
735872	738253	It's just, I don't know, it's a fighting game itself.
738773	739814	I feel a game like...
740712	752902	Soul Calibur 2 or 3 even is much more intricate in the fighting styles, whereas this is just variety, fan service, you know, just throwing tons of different things at you.
753283	755144	So, take it as you will.
755905	757486	And then that's about it.
757626	758867	One other thing, but we'll get to that later.
759108	761610	So I'll ask Miklatov, how was your gaming week?
763191	768756	My gaming week was pretty good, shockingly, since I'm not only playing Final Fantasy XI anymore.
770157	776660	This week I played a good amount of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Luminous Live on Xbox Live.
777080	778181	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
778381	780302	How come the rest of us haven't gotten a chance to play that?
780322	783583	Because you guys don't use Microsoft's network.
783723	784144	Oh, I see.
784164	785284	You're special.
785324	785924	I'm special.
787325	789506	And I had a great time with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
790286	791707	Luminous Live, not so much.
792007	795549	The 360 controller really, really, really sucks for that game.
797189	798250	I also picked up
799709	800790	Three new games this week.
801951	810780	I picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and that's kind of boring, but it got me through the Wii pre-order line on Friday.
812482	817226	I also picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner, and that's a really, really neat game.
817787	818908	I'm not too far in it.
819468	821791	And I picked up Mortal Kombat Armageddon.
822503	827547	And I think it's a decent game, but they screwed up Rain and he was my favorite character.
827827	829428	So I was not too happy about that.
831429	837393	Other than that, haven't really played much else, I guess, except for what we'll be talking about later.
838094	839495	So that's about it.
840391	847136	Um, other questions in chat room, uh, the always present extra guest on our show, orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat.
847576	853180	Jeremy Todd 1 asks, Miklatov, so you're saying the shitty 360 controllers D-pad works good for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3?
854041	860665	Actually, yeah, because you can perform the rolling moves, like, you know, down to forward and stuff like that, really easily.
861566	867130	Um, so, yeah, I would say it works pretty well for Mortal Kombat, uh, 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, rather.
868561	869061	Street Fighter 2
894686	900831	There was another comment in chatroom, Blaze said, Sky, the original Mortal Kombat never had the variety, it's a true throwback.
900851	905615	Yeah, I guess, but you know, your expectation level of fighting games was different back then.
906255	909478	But then again, come to think of it, that was kind of one of Mortal Kombat's weaknesses in the beginning.
909758	916903	I mean, yeah, it had fatalities, but the first one, as great of a game as it is, it is a little clunky.
916943	917784	Especially on the Genesis.
917804	920326	How would you like to create a fatality mode in that?
920908	921549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
942816	949691	The only problem with that is that once you've gone through that, there actually isn't this level of variety that you'd think.
949851	953239	I think it was a lot cooler when everybody had their own unique thing they did.
953769	954750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
979068	980369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1009207	1010448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1030466	1031106	No one found me.
1031547	1032447	Well, it's a big place.
1033147	1037749	But I'm going to be at YowieCon next weekend.
1038489	1041690	And I will be cosplaying as an Organization 13 member.
1042170	1042990	So you will see me.
1043010	1043390	Nerd!
1043771	1045191	And Chris and Megzy are doing it too.
1045251	1045771	Nerds!
1046472	1047552	I know, but we're cute nerds.
1048532	1051973	So we are going to be in the big trench coats with stuff.
1052394	1053514	If you find me...
1054475	1057557	Then you will get a CD sampler.
1058398	1059819	Some CDs from a different drum.
1059919	1060119	Yeah.
1060299	1063141	Yeah, we have little three-inch singles.
1063541	1068784	Rain Dancer with Come With Me and Rupesh Kartel, Death With Soft Names.
1068924	1076890	But one of the B-sides on that single is Yours To Command, which is one of the new Ditter songs that we premiered earlier on in the DDR preview segment.
1077070	1081833	So if you find me, if I'm not completely fawning over, you know, the...
1082987	1085068	Yowie Action, then you get a present.
1085088	1086289	I was going to say the Mangina.
1087069	1090570	But I will also make this disclaimer.
1091191	1095112	I'm going to be seeing Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D at the Metreon on Friday night.
1096033	1099194	And I will extend it there.
1099254	1103276	If somebody recognizes me, you get the CD.
1103776	1104077	All right.
1104677	1106418	If not at YowieCon, then at the Metreon.
1106598	1110059	I worry maybe I should give you some more because there might be a lot of our listeners at YowieCon.
1110099	1110459	We'll see.
1110880	1111620	First three people.
1112409	1112749	How's that?
1113189	1114170	Alright, we got a lot of these.
1114750	1115871	We got a lot of these, so there you go.
1116591	1119073	Two of them are for YaoiCon, one is for Nightmare Before Christmas.
1120273	1120714	There you go.
1121374	1122655	Right there, three pairs to give away.
1122715	1123055	Have fun.
1125516	1128358	Alright, so go find DarkSakura at YaoiCon.
1129339	1129519	Huh?
1131320	1133161	Oh, you... I thought... Oh, never mind.
1134101	1134601	Rob can't count!
1134621	1135622	I thought she already had one.
1136062	1136483	That's alright.
1136823	1138063	She wants to keep one for herself.
1138123	1138664	I see how it is.
1138724	1139064	That's fine.
1139761	1141382	I actually forgot that I already had one, but I will.
1141483	1141943	That's all right.
1142163	1142543	Have fun.
1142824	1143584	Give those singles away.
1145566	1148489	I will be traveling as well this weekend.
1148509	1150390	This is the weekend where I'm finally going to New York City.
1150731	1154274	Yes, I missed digital life by one whole week because I'm just cool like that.
1155094	1163422	I will be in New York City this weekend, and I took some listeners' advice and scheduled a time to be at the Nintendo World Store.
1163822	1164703	Now, here's the thing.
1165996	1170437	I haven't exactly cleared it with them or anything, and I'm not expecting a swarm of people.
1170717	1173038	We don't exactly have that many people that listen to the program.
1173358	1178479	But I will be there Saturday at noon, so come look for me at the Nintendo World Store.
1178499	1178839	And you know what?
1178859	1181200	I'll take some CDs, too, so they can come find me.
1181880	1183561	So it's a West Coast, East Coast thing.
1183581	1185941	You can come find Jamie on the West Coast, and you can come find me on the East Coast.
1185961	1186702	So he can find more.
1187042	1187682	Exactly.
1189294	1191817	So that'll be Saturday at noon at the Nintendo World Store.
1192477	1193038	I will be there.
1193138	1195239	And Loki you can find on his couch all weekend long.
1195259	1197401	I'll be on my couch at my house.
1198142	1199583	Probably getting some.
1200584	1201084	Yeah, probably.
1202586	1204968	But I will have a CD in case you find me.
1206008	1207249	Just in case.
1208390	1210312	Mikotov, will you be anywhere for the fans to meet?
1210392	1211713	Actually, no one knows what you look like anyway.
1212394	1212894	Yeah, they don't.
1213395	1215196	I'll be at work, probably.
1215777	1217118	So if you find me at work...
1218154	1219935	I'll give you a high five, because I don't have CDs.
1220496	1221276	Alright, sounds good.
1221617	1225360	Actually, I should, because the picture on the form is sort of outdated.
1226501	1233446	My hair is dyed red now with black streaks in the front, so it will probably be straight, not curly.
1233566	1238550	Yeah, you look a little different than you do in the album art that you see on iTunes, because that picture is like six months old.
1239451	1241772	More than that, we did those pictures last winter.
1241933	1242213	Wow.
1242593	1243234	It's time for new pictures.
1243254	1243694	We need new ones.
1244352	1244792	New ones.
1245112	1245393	All right.
1245993	1249855	If anyone looks at my DeviantArt account on my Deviant tag, that's what my hair looks like.
1250575	1252596	All right.
1252656	1253436	So come find us.
1254037	1257778	New York City, Saturday, YaliCon, Metreon, all weekend long.
1258539	1260440	Orange Launch Radio invades coast to coast.
1261340	1263741	DDR previews a little bit later on in this segment.
1263861	1266883	Two new songs from Ultramix 4 and two new songs from DDR Universe.
1267563	1267863	Tonight.
1268423	1269624	But first, some gaming news.
1270424	1270724	Yes.
1271245	1272065	Lots of gaming news.
1272549	1277553	And of course, like every year, we were looking forward to E3.
1277613	1280095	The key word is were.
1281156	1287581	Unfortunately, E3, as announced earlier this year, has been downsized.
1289222	1295907	Unfortunately, we won't be able to see this wonderful giant expo with 60,000 plus people in it and
1296889	1299431	Well, anyways, here's the details on what's going to be happening with this.
1299711	1302693	It's now being called the E3 Media and Business Summit.
1302873	1309678	It will take place between July 11th and the 13th in Santa Monica, California.
1310579	1321567	And they're actually going to be taking up several hotels as well as the large Barker Hangar, which is going to be kind of a show floor type thing.
1321827	1322128	I don't know.
1322968	1325190	I guess a place that they can use to demonstrate stuff.
1325945	1336267	and it's going to be invite only and basically according to Doug Lowenstein this is kind of how he's summing up the whole E3.
1336447	1338428	E3 is not a place where a product is sold anymore.
1338768	1348670	The industry is recognized as a big part of mainstream culture so the need for a big glittering event to validate the industry is not what it used to be.
1349630	1354171	What is needed is to focus on the fact that E3 is going to be much more
1354830	1356951	about media-related opportunities.
1357371	1361372	The question is, what is the most efficient way to create those opportunities?
1362112	1364373	Here's my question to Doug Lewenstein there.
1365413	1373896	When you say media, do you mean media or the people that have TV shows and giant multi-million dollar websites?
1373956	1379578	Because talking with some of the other publishers out there, that seems to be the case.
1379638	1381819	They just kind of want to ignore the smaller guys.
1382319	1382539	So,
1383103	1390646	Just remember that the smaller guys do have a reach out there in the marketplace and do contact your customers.
1390766	1397868	So take that in mind when you're picking those select thousands of people that are going to be at this event.
1399309	1407172	So that whole thing where he says there's no need for E3 to be the glittering event it once was, he's basically saying, Paris Hilton, stay home!
1408146	1414608	Keep your skanky ass at home with your dumb little dog and get the hell away from my show.
1415568	1416629	And to that I say amen.
1416829	1420630	Well, I understand because there are a lot of people there and it's hard to conduct business.
1421270	1428633	But at the same time, it's good to have the publicity for your games, especially the smaller companies.
1429113	1435315	They want people noticing their game there because then it gets covered and then the word spreads about it.
1435495	1435955	And I think
1436431	1438031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1456269	1457149	at a recent media event.
1457169	1461231	Big Boy saying that's essentially what they did is they copy-pasted from the press release.
1461251	1464052	So if that's what you want, you know, why bother throwing a show?
1464132	1465573	Just fucking email E3.
1465673	1469215	Just put E3 in a zip file and send it to their email.
1469355	1470055	Web conference.
1471736	1474077	Not in a conference room with those intercom things.
1474597	1474917	I don't know.
1475377	1477858	I'm just worried, personally, I'm worried we're not going to be invited.
1478479	1479219	That's my only worry.
1479319	1484141	Because, you know, and it would be very disappointing to me because I really do care about, you know,
1485174	1486435	DarkSakura.com
1512389	1512969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1533881	1549729	Scott over at All Games and the folks at Arena Interactive Lounge where we broadcast they're probably having a fucking field day at this news they're probably so excited but I also think and I'm not insinuating anything I don't know shit about what they're doing next year but just knowing the type of guy that Scott is
1550452	1551592	Outpost is where it's at next year.
1551632	1552913	I miss my yearly playing of Xtango.
1582122	1583123	Poor Xtango.
1583403	1586527	Hey, yeah, Scott, if you're listening, get the Xtango folks at Arena.
1587648	1589350	Tell them to give me a copy.
1589370	1591473	So we can ask them if their game's ever going to freaking come out.
1591934	1592394	It'll be nice.
1593716	1595858	It's going to be part of the brand new Duke Nukem Forever.
1597360	1598201	Coming out on the Phantom.
1600284	1600664	Anyway.
1602771	1611973	Speaking of games that we've been waiting for, the demo for Phantasy Star Universe on Xbox 360 is out.
1612493	1614593	Today being Sunday for us.
1615053	1616934	It is the last day that you can download it.
1618214	1622555	I think it was down midnight on Saturday.
1623455	1623995	Well, whatever.
1624035	1627916	By the time the people who download this show hear it, it's too late.
1628156	1629496	Either way, it sucked.
1630467	1633668	Well, at any rate, I haven't played mine yet.
1633708	1637870	I did download it yesterday, which is why I made my whole Gamertag account and everything.
1638390	1642492	But it will be up for play until Wednesday midnight.
1642892	1645153	So that's the only time you're going to get to.
1645173	1649134	Of course, it's already been in Japan forever, and I already know someone who has it on PC.
1649394	1655737	But you know what's really pissy, though, about the Japanese release is that your CDs are all coded much like the...
1656901	1657802	and DarkSakura.
1684156	1689360	Once the actual release is out, it will be $9.99 a month for our European listeners.
1689420	1690861	That's $6.99 pounds.
1693782	1706850	And they're saying that it will be available for your license, or they're calling it Guardian License, will be available for purchase beginning the 24th of November on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.
1707091	1711693	Luckily, all the achievements are offline, so I can just rent this thing, which is excellent.
1712174	1712454	Whore.
1713072	1716213	And note the other best part about that beta demo.
1716533	1719894	It's Tuesday that Xbox Live is going to be down the whole day.
1719994	1722215	So you actually only get about two days to play that.
1723015	1723675	Thank you, Sega.
1723695	1724456	Yeah, that's right.
1724556	1725836	Xbox Live is going to be down Tuesday.
1725936	1726596	So whoops.
1726957	1727577	Whoopsie-daisy.
1727977	1728777	Forgot to plan for that.
1728957	1729217	Oh well.
1729837	1730858	Well, at any rate.
1732333	1736637	It's already out on PC in Japan and that hasn't stopped people.
1746179	1750283	There is someone who is on one of the big Phantasy Star sites.
1750303	1752565	Again, I'm not going to list names publicly.
1752965	1757049	Has made a loading tool for this to bypass the online registration.
1757629	1763094	You cannot play it online, but you can play it in single player mode if you want to try out the PC version.
1763875	1765596	Just look around.
1766037	1766557	It's out there.
1768899	1770981	I actually got to play the PSU demo.
1772077	1773360	or Beta, whatever you want to call it.
1773400	1778731	Now, the thing is, though, it's kind of hard for me to base my judgment off of Beta because...
1779366	1780587	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1807462	1815608	What I did get to play, the only problem I had with it is the tutorial was a little bit clunky and would freeze up, so it was easier to bypass it.
1815628	1822632	But if you bypass the tutorial, then you kind of don't know what you're doing in the game because just enough has changed from Phantasy Star Online.
1823653	1830477	But finally, once I figured it out and got in there, it was kind of fun, and I played with a stranger through one level, and it ran pretty well.
1831998	1834640	and I gotta say, some of the sceneries are really nice.
1835080	1848007	Like, if you figure out, once you go to the, for those that are playing the beta, go up to the fourth floor, go out the left side, and then you can transport to different planets, and you can transport to this greenish planet that has like a very, like, um...
1849109	1849569	and so on.
1871977	1874881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1888634	1905708	The one thing that I sort of hope is that, you know, since we've done this massive download, it would be nice, though, that for the folks that actually have gone into the effort of downloading the game, that we could just play off the downloaded version, but maybe there could be, like, a quick mode or something that they actually use the demo version for.
1906828	1907269	Oh, I see.
1907469	1911652	Well, they already said you're not going to be able to transfer your character you made in the beta over, so... Yeah, that's ridiculous.
1911892	1912173	Oh, well.
1913113	1913834	Mikotov, what do you think?
1913874	1914995	You spent a lot of time playing this.
1915335	1916476	I really like it.
1917446	1940406	I have a few really glaring issues with it though So I play as a force on Phantasy Star Online because they're the best And in this game, from what I can tell so far Is that the only way I can do magic is if I equip it to a weapon So I'm going to have to carry multiple weapons Or maybe, I don't know I'm talking as loud as I can
1943028	1948309	I have to equip multiple weapons so I can have different magic spells and that's going to really make me angry.
1949210	1954972	And I like that Sega's crazy word filtering stuff still happens.
1955332	1960614	Like somebody had to use periods to cuss at me today and it was pretty funny.
1961194	1962115	Why were they cussing at you?
1962835	1965496	Because they're like 12 year olds that are playing Xbox Live.
1965616	1966516	OMG free game.
1966676	1968657	Yeah, exactly like what you said earlier.
1970796	1998790	voice chat, I don't know I didn't party because I don't want to play with other people right now I believe voice chat is only available once you get into a zone it's not like in the lobby like it was in the first game I think it actually is, it's in party but one thing though for anybody who is playing on Sega's website, they do have a feedback form they want feedback from the beta apparently, so make sure that if you see any glitches, anything weird, anything you don't like
1999310	2001132	Make sure that you post about it on their page.
2001412	2004274	Doesn't it seem like they're kind of a little close, though, with only ten days to go?
2004595	2005555	I mean, is this going to be another eight days?
2005575	2014203	If it's something that just requires a general tweak or a change in code, then... But the games have already been shipped to retailers, essentially, waiting to go out.
2014223	2017085	But I think it's talking about, like, major glitches.
2018566	2024191	Yeah, I know, but here we go again, another Xbox 360 game where they're patching it on the back end to fix all the bugs.
2024291	2027174	You know, I'm just kind of like... That happens with any type of MMO.
2028961	2032183	MMOs exist to be glitchy.
2032864	2038567	I just hope it doesn't stay, you know, Wrappy Christmas for five years like the old Xbox one.
2038667	2043970	It sucks that it is glitchy, but we shouldn't expect MMOs to be glitchy.
2044230	2047092	That's just fucking laziness in programming is what it is.
2047452	2053316	I mean, you should be doing extensive beta testing, especially since the game came out already in Japan.
2053736	2058359	You've already got some beta testing right there, whatever you want to call it, but
2059426	2065612	I think it's really ridiculous just to say, oh yeah, this is a beta test and hopefully everything goes well because we already done the game.
2066072	2068554	So if we find a bug, yeah, that fucking sucks.
2070075	2071116	Any other thoughts on PSU?
2072197	2076921	The only other thing I don't like about it, and I know I'm being negative about it, but I do really like the game.
2078473	2100278	At least in PSO, you all kind of look the same, like, you know, all the forces had dresses and such, but their creation in this game, while it's highly detailed, the costumes, each, like, the numens and the humans for each gender, they all get the same costumes, so...
2101434	2103856	You see a lot of the same people running around.
2104476	2110261	It's pretty terrible, because, I mean, I don't want to see a whole bunch of people with just the black and red shirt on.
2111202	2115245	And it doesn't seem like anybody's really, you know, their own character because of it.
2115705	2120288	I do understand that the RBG slider has been removed to change color.
2121009	2121329	Oh, really?
2121369	2123911	I didn't know it was there in, like... It was in the old ones.
2123951	2125252	You could change the colors of the outfits.
2125573	2127374	Oh, um, no, it was...
2128930	2130852	The hair and different tones.
2130872	2132313	You can do it for some of the hairs.
2133193	2136315	And the eyes and stuff, which is really cool because you can do eyes before.
2136335	2137836	It's just depending on your face.
2138537	2146342	But I mean, at least there were different patterns on the different outfits you could pick in PSO.
2146662	2150164	But now it's just palette swaps and they look pretty terrible.
2150925	2157269	You know, since Miklatov likes to play a force, essentially what he's saying is he misses being able to wear a dress in Phantasy Star Online.
2158081	2159482	Yeah, actually, I kind of do.
2159542	2163043	It doesn't look like a Force if I'm wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt.
2163083	2163723	I'm sorry.
2165324	2168365	Dude, the Forces were great because the men had these evening gowns.
2168886	2173688	What I'm thinking is they probably removed some of the stuff for the beta.
2173848	2175929	I mean, because it's, you know, they cut down the file size.
2176589	2179130	I think it's actually like that on the PC version.
2180210	2183172	I'll have to, I actually have to ask my friend who's been playing it.
2184472	2186153	Oh, hopefully they'll release more later.
2186213	2186533	I don't know.
2187452	2187892	Thanks for watching!
2207762	2209644	Moving on to another Xbox-related story.
2210064	2216090	Microsoft is teaming up with Best Buy and the Boys and Girls Club of America to go on a 20-city bus tour.
2216490	2225259	They're going to be educating parents on the ESRB rating scheme and how to implement parental controls on the Xbox 360 and the Xbox Live service.
2225659	2232065	In other words, hopefully there'll be a tutorial on how to block asses on the Xbox 360 cams for parents.
2232425	2232986	So, you know,
2233516	2241643	This is a nice, you know, good service, feel-good community thing, but it certainly doesn't help in selling parents on Xbox 360s, does it?
2243745	2244005	I'm sorry?
2244225	2244726	I think it does.
2246021	2247363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2265089	2269552	Anyway, the tour is going to be going around pretty much the top cities in the U.S.
2269612	2276335	where the most people are, you know, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle.
2276996	2282619	If you want to check out the full schedule, you can always check out xbox.com slash isyourfamilyset.
2284420	2285481	Is your family set, Loki?
2286781	2289383	I would hope so, because I don't have a family.
2289683	2291424	I'm set, so, you know...
2292902	2297790	I'm sat and ready to see some Xbox Cam boobies and cocks.
2297930	2299734	Let's make sure you're 18 and over, please.
2299974	2301577	I have the internet for boobs.
2303100	2306061	Well, I haven't seen any of that stuff yet, but yeah, that'd be kind of fun.
2306321	2307201	No, neither have I. I'm just kidding.
2307221	2307901	I don't really want to see it.
2307921	2310502	They should have a channel that's only that stuff.
2310742	2311562	Like the Underground?
2312002	2316103	Like, yeah, something like the Red Light District or something.
2316123	2317903	Well, yeah, you do get to classify yourself.
2317923	2319164	Call the Green Door.
2319284	2321664	Well, you get to classify yourself, you know, under Xbox.
2321684	2324725	Like, ooh, you're recreational, you're pro, you're Underground, right?
2324985	2326225	They do need Red Light District.
2326485	2330466	But I have never seen those categories actually dictate...
2331195	2331795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2357118	2374713	One such person, Tom Taylor, T-Squared for short, is actually some 20-something-year-old professional gamer who has landed a $250,000 gaming contract in addition to running his brand new video game tutoring company.
2375614	2376555	And basically...
2377529	2387853	The Associated Press spoke with him about his earning six figures, and basically his response to the whole thing was, he takes risks.
2388673	2389233	I take risks.
2389333	2392255	In order to get paid, you have to take risks.
2392455	2398497	I think I took the biggest risk I could take dropping out of school to play video games, and it paid off.
2398917	2403879	I guess some people are just born with talent in certain things, like Michael Jordan was born to play basketball.
2404319	2406640	I feel I was born to play video games.
2408477	2410358	Yeah, that's a really great role model.
2410458	2413018	Drop out of school so you can play video games professionally.
2414199	2415919	I don't want to see this guy.
2417360	2421501	I suggest all the gaming companies out there pick up this guy as your spokesperson.
2421521	2425822	That is the perfect role model you want for your customers.
2426142	2427903	Drop out of school because you know what?
2429003	2431384	You can buy some games on a minimum wage job.
2431444	2431944	It's fine.
2433264	2434104	I want them to hire me.
2435545	2436225	I finished school.
2436972	2438072	I'm an educated gamer.
2438932	2451735	I want to tear into this guy, but I can't help but think that would be a little bit hypocritical when I think back to college and all the class I missed due to Final Fantasy VII.
2452075	2454916	I used to skip class to watch Sailor Moon.
2455236	2460597	I think there's nothing wrong in the fact that playing video games for a profession... I mean, granted, that's pretty risky.
2460757	2461257	I mean, because...
2462074	2463096	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2480310	2483953	I think there's a difference, too, between high school dropout and college dropout.
2484133	2485114	College dropout, that's fine.
2485174	2499245	In this society, there's an expectation, you know, well, certainly, I mean, again, I guess it depends on which part of the country you're in, but, you know, there's a real pressure out there to really, you've got to graduate high school if you want to move up in the corporate world.
2499285	2505110	I mean, granted, there are jobs available, and I don't know, because it's like there's exceptions to every rule, but I just feel like
2505805	2508086	Blackboy says, wait, how many pop stars never went to college?
2530649	2544676	Well, I have no problem with people not going to college because, you know what, personally, I didn't go to college and I don't think I really missed anything because there are actually a lot of people that will start up their own businesses and stuff and they're very successful without going to college.
2545136	2551439	I mean, granted, college does help with certain jobs and stuff like that, but it's not necessary if you've already got the smarts to kind of do it.
2551519	2554681	You can pretty much start up a company and be successful without it.
2554701	2555781	I dropped out of college.
2555801	2559783	I'm not exactly proud of it, but at the time, it's what I had to do and I don't regret it.
2560270	2564472	I've actually been in college off and on now for about 10 years.
2566353	2568394	But see, though, high school is important.
2568594	2570454	I think you should be finishing high school.
2570895	2572635	I mean, because... Or at least test out of it.
2572775	2573536	Yeah, exactly.
2573556	2575777	You should be doing better education in high school, though.
2576617	2578978	Or, okay, I mean, I don't know.
2579238	2584140	I just have a really big problem with someone like this being, you know, kind of a sponsor.
2584361	2588262	Because, you know, all we need this guy is to actually start playing good and winning stuff.
2588302	2589983	And then, you know, we'll have him, you know,
2590838	2594980	I got really good by not going to high school.
2595160	2596501	Yeah, that's excellent.
2596961	2598422	In other words, kids, be cool.
2598462	2599102	Stay in school.
2599242	2599742	Exactly.
2600443	2601923	Other comments from our chat room here.
2602324	2606946	Funnydale says, this guy is going to be working at Burger King in five years, cleaning out the fat fryer.
2608487	2613469	Hitstun says, I could see him getting a right thumb injury and being out for a season and going broke.
2616170	2616791	So that's true.
2616831	2619772	What do you have to fall back on if you get carpal tunnel?
2621155	2622055	You're screwed, young man.
2622215	2625136	I have to have that Atari controller that used your eyebrows.
2625976	2629657	Or hopefully in the future we'll be controlling games with our brains.
2631697	2637799	Well, speaking of brains and certain people who remain unnamed on this radio show not using them!
2638799	2639099	Sorry.
2639879	2648601	Well, we've all been paying attention to the fact that Bully was pulled into court for being, you know, Violent Game, oh my god.
2648842	2650442	I have a new name for said...
2651772	2653773	How about Crack Frommson?
2654713	2655634	I still like Jackie Poo.
2655654	2656414	Oh, whatever.
2656734	2657555	Or Jackass.
2659215	2669820	At any rate, the verdict that went down, though, with the ruling is basically the judge is not going to prohibit the sale of Bully.
2671040	2677883	To quote, in the time that he played the game, the judge said he did not see anything so violent that would require the game to be held from being shipped.
2678576	2682379	The Judge and Take-Two employee used a cheat code in order to skip around in the game.
2682800	2686843	From what I understand, I think they played through the game for at least two hours.
2688184	2690987	And that's plenty of time to get a good feel for the game.
2691367	2697593	They're also saying that there wasn't anything different than what was seen on TV, really.
2697993	2700235	OMG, there's cheat codes to skip around in the game.
2700795	2701236	Excellent.
2702414	2712802	But if anyone's curious about how everybody's not friend, the real bully of the industry reacted, he was told to sit down.
2713762	2716164	Yeah, weren't there like outbursts in the courtroom and that whole thing?
2716244	2717285	Oh, I would have loved to have been there.
2718185	2723529	The thing is that he had no business being there because he has, you cannot work...
2724258	2728739	I think is legal advisor for something that you have an interest in.
2729119	2733461	He did mention though that he hoped that people got injured after playing this game so he could go, I told you so.
2733741	2739162	Didn't he like sneak a slingshot into the courtroom to make some type of point about this is what people are going to do?
2739182	2741723	Okay, okay.
2741983	2743904	I know we're not really supposed to talk about it.
2744344	2745244	What about Simpsons?
2745704	2746765	Bart has a slingshot.
2747085	2749365	I don't see slingshot related deaths in the news.
2750366	2751086	He's an idiot.
2752109	2757393	You can be educated and still be stupid.
2758094	2759295	And this man is living proof.
2759855	2760696	I cannot wait.
2760856	2767161	And actually, the thing about him being involved in this case is actually, from what I understand, precedent to have him disbarred in that state.
2767241	2768322	So let's hope it happens.
2768763	2771445	RavensDolphin says, Dennis the Menace has a slingshot.
2772065	2774267	Go back to, like, 50s, you know, homely.
2774287	2775288	40s, I think.
2775328	2775848	Was it?
2775948	2778490	40s, yeah.
2778510	2780252	They were on Nickelodeon when I was a kid, so...
2781681	2783862	It's human nature.
2785522	2790583	I'm trying to remember which philosopher said this, but the nature of man is nasty, brutish, and short.
2791923	2793903	You know, people are prone to violence.
2793963	2795604	It's written into our freaking DNA.
2796264	2799204	You know, no one talks about the dangers of cup stacking either.
2800585	2803265	Really, Jack Thompson... Oh, I said it.
2804545	2805546	Now I gotta go kill myself.
2805886	2806266	It's alright.
2808078	2809580	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2825726	2838977	Doesn't that set the precedent that Walmart ought to be pulling copies of Kill Bill off the shelves and Pulp Fiction and other violent train spotting and other really violent movies?
2839317	2840378	It's a double standard.
2841979	2843480	Of course, maybe Jack Thompson would like that.
2843520	2843880	I don't know.
2844141	2845662	I said it too.
2845702	2846602	Spank, spank, spank.
2846643	2848884	Maybe they should change it to Bible Mart.
2849945	2854809	Look, it's still a very nasty double standard that we're seeing in the overall entertainment industry today.
2855576	2857858	Right now, video games is the current scapegoat.
2858039	2859400	I mean, that's how it is.
2859560	2862042	It was music in the 80s and early 90s.
2862663	2870771	It's evolved on to, you know, it was, back in the days, it was, you know, we can't watch this TV show because it's so risque.
2871351	2872452	And they attack in the middle.
2872472	2875015	Oh my God, Mr. and Mrs. Brady share a bed.
2875055	2875515	Who knew?
2875655	2876556	Oh my God.
2876876	2877217	Elvis.
2877857	2878817	and his hip thrusting.
2879337	2879797	Oh no.
2880358	2885759	Or, you know, people would go on, what was that example, on the Ed Sullivan show and ask him to change lyrics.
2886019	2888959	Women are going to look at that and get impregnated immediately.
2889659	2899881	Or even now with the whole, you know, not having, you know, available women's, you know, health care because we're going to decide to take over the world, you know, and fuck everybody.
2900101	2900461	I don't know.
2900641	2903102	Flaming Bozo in our chatroom says, why doesn't he go to porn?
2904548	2905409	Why doesn't he fight porn?
2905569	2907289	But at the same time, they don't sell porn at Walmart.
2907549	2910951	Because everybody knows Jackie Poo shops at Walmart.
2910991	2913812	I'm sure they sell Skinamax type movies there, but anyway.
2914472	2921294	We all know that the whole reason he's so retentive is that he's just not getting laid.
2924275	2924555	Wow.
2924575	2926056	That's it.
2926296	2927236	No one would.
2927737	2931178	Stories about our dear friend, Mr.
2933815	2935015	Get us a little bit angry.
2935055	2940798	I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but I get so frustrated whenever I read about what this clown's up to next.
2942199	2943560	It makes me just want to rant a little bit.
2943620	2944960	Doesn't it make you want to rant a little bit?
2945501	2945821	A little.
2946181	2951444	So I think it's time to bring on the trumpets and the symphonies to declare it be the FUs of the Week!
2962785	2963285	My F.U.
2963325	2968506	of the week goes towards the stupid evil sinus infection from hell.
2970207	2980830	For anyone who wasn't listening last year, I was sick for about two months with a weird combination of bronchitis and pneumonia because of the sinus infection.
2982902	2987545	Well, I have a sinus infection again, and it's starting off exactly the same way that my last one did.
2987605	2993008	So now they're pumping me full of antibiotics and all kinds of anti-allergy drugs and all kinds of crap.
2993348	2996730	It makes me feel absolutely loony and also lose my voice.
2997111	2999852	Like, I wake up in the morning and have no voice.
2999872	3000353	It's crazy.
3000493	3004015	And I love to talk, I guess, since I'm on a radio show and all that.
3005236	3006436	And I'm not always sick.
3008037	3009258	F you to Fireboma, too.
3010159	3010659	But, um...
3011497	3013398	A few to the sinus infection.
3013598	3016218	And also, the advice nurse was so funny.
3016259	3019860	She's like, now, you've got chronic fatigue syndrome.
3019920	3022781	It says here on your things you're going to get really tired.
3023681	3025101	No shit, lady.
3027342	3034544	But to their credit, the Kaiser folks were really nice to me and gave me my choice of antibiotics.
3036165	3037185	Yeah, I hate it.
3038825	3040506	You sound like I've been drinking whiskey all night.
3041229	3047074	I always thought that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome was an inclination to wearing camo, but, you know, I guess I'm wrong.
3047314	3051357	No, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is wearing camo and, you know, smoking the chronic.
3052938	3053418	Gotcha.
3054319	3064407	Anyways, F you to the Indian Casino that we went to last night because, you know, like most Indian... Actually, this Indian Casino seems to be the worst one.
3064467	3066128	It's Thunder Valley over here.
3066628	3069831	I believe it's in Rockland or something, whatever, in California.
3070621	3074643	And basically, they want to rape you for your money.
3075023	3079265	Kind of like America did to the Indians way back when.
3079645	3084767	But anyways, I did leave there the only losing 50 cents, so that's really good.
3087308	3091670	Oh, and by the way, for Rob, F you the fact that they do not have coconut shrimp.
3094811	3098313	My F you of the week goes to commuting.
3099312	3101053	I'm giving the FU to driving this week.
3101073	3101713	Who would have thought?
3102074	3106376	No, my FU goes to commuting and long commutes and they make me frumpy and sad.
3107016	3107336	That's it.
3107376	3107857	Mikotov.
3110298	3120844	My FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making a crappy Xbox 360 controller and ruining a brilliant game like Luminous because you guys can't make a D-pad.
3123906	3126387	And that's going to do it for this week's Dose of Angst.
3127108	3131632	It works so much better to play Luminous on PSP.
3131712	3135436	I have to use the analog stick on the 360, and I'll tell you, that's not really fun at all.
3135456	3135756	All right.
3145492	3154594	Well, speaking of Sony controllers, there's a new one coming out for the PlayStation 3, which was shown at Digital Life, which happened in New York City this weekend.
3154634	3156694	I'm sure some of our listeners, I know some of them were there.
3157054	3161375	I'm sure we'll get some calls in the Skype line a little later from the show from our folks who are at Digital Life.
3161855	3169237	But there were some awards handed out at Digital Life, and I'm assuming this was Digital Life and Ziff Davis that handed out these awards.
3169257	3171117	I have no idea how they picked them.
3171877	3172377	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3191306	3192107	Oh, wait, they do!
3192227	3195831	Okay, but to be fair, they have one for Xbox 360 as well, right?
3196131	3197452	No, they have computer and video game.
3197472	3197833	Whatever.
3197933	3199194	I don't give a shit, okay?
3199394	3212388	The point is, is that, you know, they got this award or whatever, so it seems like, in some folks' mind, maybe things are coming around for Sony, and maybe now Sony is starting to put out the... It's hard for me to say.
3212868	3214630	I didn't play PlayStation 3 at Digital
3215190	3222414	I'm going to be relying on the listeners who call in later in the show to tell us if the PlayStation 3 at Digital Life was deserving of this award.
3222954	3223914	I can just see it now.
3224355	3225955	You know why the PlayStation 3 is awesome?
3226095	3227956	Because it smells like money!
3230337	3231418	Somehow I doubt that's it.
3231718	3233919	What if they had really good games on display there?
3234459	3235380	Loki, you don't know.
3235440	3235980	You weren't there.
3236920	3240062	Yeah, but I saw the list of games and probably not.
3241345	3242025	Whatever, you know.
3242226	3242686	Hey, great.
3243066	3244807	Someone wants to spend $600 for the system.
3245408	3246088	More power to you.
3246108	3247389	Go pre-order it at EB.
3247549	3247909	Oh, wait.
3248409	3248930	Can't do that.
3250591	3255214	SSJ100 Matt says, Sky, they gave out Japanese whores and HD TVs.
3256334	3258476	DJ Kipples and Bits says, I went to Digital Life.
3258536	3260957	I have no idea how the PS3 won during that show.
3262498	3262938	Let's see.
3263519	3267861	Jaded2006 says, Just keep thinking that Sony is going to make a turnaround.
3270323	3270543	Hmm.
3271385	3272126	Very interesting.
3272886	3274687	Also, some other awards won at the show.
3274788	3276669	Gaming Hardware, PlayStation 3.
3278190	3280632	Gaming Software, Final Fantasy XII.
3282593	3289398	For those of you that have to shop for kids this holiday season, the best gift for kids was the Fisher-Price Spark Art Easel.
3289779	3290599	Is that like a Light Bright?
3290699	3290999	I don't know.
3291520	3292300	I miss Light Bright.
3292921	3294682	Best Booth also went to Sony.
3295343	3297064	But the hippest booth...
3297722	3298682	went to Napster.
3299022	3299502	Remember them?
3300063	3300763	Remember Napster?
3301503	3302803	Hey kids, remember Napster?
3303223	3306244	There had to have been recreational pharmaceuticals involved in that show.
3307644	3309585	I can neither confirm nor deny those statements again.
3309625	3311325	We'll hear from the listeners a little later in the show.
3311365	3313626	I'm sure they're already trying to hammer the Skype line to get in.
3314446	3314946	So we'll see.
3316887	3319127	And SSJ100 Matt is putting out a call.
3319167	3320407	Where's our listener Graywolf?
3321248	3322328	He's the guy in the forums that...
3323078	3324699	Unapologetic in a Sony fandom.
3325019	3328361	Who apparently writes in poetic prose form.
3328661	3329301	They're fun to read.
3329602	3330242	You know what?
3330902	3334284	I encourage the opposing viewpoint to the masses.
3334384	3337126	I encourage the opposing viewpoint as long as it's educated.
3337866	3342508	And I'm all for a little bit of friendly debate as long as it doesn't resort to name-calling.
3344969	3351054	Sony is apparently pretty happy after this week's pre-order fest at GameStop and EB.
3352294	3356938	Of course, in case you didn't hear, they sold out of all the systems that the stores got.
3357018	3360761	Well, it's not hard to sell out when you're only reserving 8 systems at a store.
3360801	3366385	I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, now, now, 8 was, you know, a larger number.
3366425	3367966	Some stores only got like 4, I think.
3367986	3370228	Well, some had 16, to be fair, but still.
3370328	3370728	8 to 16, whatever.
3371289	3377674	Anyway, so that's somewhere between 28,000 to about 58,000 systems.
3378574	3379375	It's not bad.
3380275	3388761	Basically, according to the Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson, Dave Cracker... Yeah, that's Cracker, alright.
3388781	3389622	His name's Cracker?
3389982	3392244	Well, Cracker, or Craker, or whatever.
3392324	3393184	Listen up, Cracker!
3395006	3396967	Anyways, sorry, it had to be said.
3397687	3399569	It was within minutes, because, you know, obviously...
3400336	3402137	Oh yeah, because you had the line going.
3403078	3409823	It reconfirms the excitement and anticipation that we've known since the very first discussion of PlayStation 3.
3410083	3415347	We're just pleased to see that the reaction from the consumer is as strong as we anticipated it would be.
3415848	3418810	It helps validate everything that we've been seeing up to this point.
3419150	3425295	So if I released a system with only one unit in the United States, we'd be like, we sold everything in one second.
3426858	3427558	It's awesome!
3427999	3433460	My rebuttal to Sony is, everyone just go read VG Cats, look at the last comic.
3434100	3435301	It perfectly illustrates it.
3435781	3436721	And you know what?
3437061	3442163	I'm sure we'll be covering this a little bit later on, but I don't think a lot of those people were keeping those systems.
3443203	3444624	It's more like, hey, you know what?
3444644	3449045	The Xbox 360 was being able to be sold for twice retail on eBay.
3449605	3450225	Hmm.
3450845	3453546	I'll tell you what, because I've got a PlayStation 3 pre-ordered.
3454286	3455127	I know, traitor.
3455787	3455867	My
3456625	3458186	No, you're just a gaming whore.
3482264	3484170	The DarkSakura Autographed Edition PS3.
3484311	3488925	Well, also, I mean, of course, the Wii did also sell out as well.
3490174	3491215	GameStop, and EB.
3491255	3496597	I believe each store was getting upwards to 32 systems.
3497218	3500940	I think it ended up being about twice what they were getting with the PlayStation 3.
3501400	3510124	Now, to give the pro-Sony side of this a little bit, I would believe there are 50,000 people in this country that excited about the PlayStation 3.
3510904	3513986	I mean, for tech junkies, it is a Blu-ray player.
3514686	3515507	It's pretty cheap.
3515607	3516808	That's pretty exciting.
3518149	3520050	I would believe that there's that many fanboys.
3520090	3521631	I don't think there's any.
3522452	3531738	It's hard to go, ooh, it's this ravaging success when you consider there's really only eight PlayStation 3s at the store to be reserved.
3531778	3532118	I don't know.
3532158	3534780	We'll see a little more towards November 17th.
3534800	3538002	But then again, like I've always been saying, is launch really that important?
3538482	3542365	PlayStation 2 didn't wow me at launch, but it really won me over about a year later.
3543066	3543526	Well, I don't know.
3543891	3546892	Maybe by a year later they will have actual systems in the stores.
3547272	3547632	Alright.
3548373	3551774	I want to ask Mikotov really quick while he's still here because he's going to be leaving in a little bit.
3552034	3555335	I wanted to ask you, you actually camped out for the Wii pre-order, right?
3555496	3556096	I totally did.
3556156	3557076	Tell us about that experience.
3557096	3557596	How did that go?
3557656	3558417	What time did you get there?
3558637	3559237	Who else was there?
3559597	3564959	So me and my roommate decided we were going to go do the Wii pre-order because we really, really want that system after playing it.
3564979	3568841	Because unlike some folks, I actually have to report to work at 8 o'clock in the morning.
3569381	3570141	Yeah, whatever.
3570681	3571502	I can go whenever I want.
3573150	3577631	And so we got up about 3.45 a.m.
3577791	3579392	to go to our local GameStop.
3580232	3584253	And he went a little bit earlier than I did, but I arrived about a little past 5.
3585413	3590234	And there were already 16 people ahead of me, which was insane to me.
3590894	3595635	Because, you know, I didn't think people were as stupid as I am.
3595655	3596796	Then again, this is the Bay Area.
3596836	3597976	This is, you know, tech home.
3598176	3598916	Yeah, that's true.
3599316	3601717	But I live in the sunset, which is like dead, so...
3602520	3603700	It was still shocking to me.
3605421	3608262	And then, you know, more people started showing up.
3608963	3614845	And around, I would say about maybe six, we had a good 30 people in line to help pass the time.
3614885	3616706	I played clubhouse games, which is okay.
3617666	3621968	And then I'd say about 9.30, we had a little over 70 people in line.
3622403	3624504	What's great about that is that the store opens at 10.
3624684	3641132	So at about 9.30, 9.40, an employee came out and those people who had been there since I would say about 7 or 8, the people that were towards the back, they got told that they would not be pre-ordering any systems today because they only got 32 in.
3641952	3649676	So I thought it was kind of jerky that the employees waited that long to come out and tell the people in the back of the line that they weren't going to get anything.
3649696	3651717	To their credit, though, corporate probably didn't tell them until then.
3652329	3654531	They probably didn't get an email until overnight or something.
3654551	3655211	That's not true.
3655331	3656192	That's not true.
3656212	3659654	They knew a few days in advance.
3660035	3660615	Poopy!
3661195	3661796	They're just jerks.
3662356	3667540	But anyway, so they let us in two at a time to pre-order our systems, and it went pretty smooth.
3667560	3675846	They gave out a list of stuff we could pre-order with the system while we were standing in line, put the $50 down, and then we were on our way.
3676146	3676907	It was really...
3678283	3679264	Thanks for watching!
3695285	3697046	What types of people did you see in line?
3697086	3700088	Was it all gaming nerds like you, or did you have the older parents?
3700108	3700808	I'm not a gaming nerd.
3701209	3702769	You are, but that's beside the point.
3703090	3705611	Were there any older people in the line?
3705671	3708913	Were there excited girls from college?
3708993	3710574	I saw maybe three girls.
3712255	3718579	And then the front of the line comprised of scrawny white guys and Asian guys.
3719139	3724422	And then the back of the line were the older parents that maybe...
3725512	3732353	I still don't think that pre-ordering the Wii is all that big of a deal just because Nintendo loves us and you know they're making lots of them
3754204	3755525	I just wanted the security.
3755925	3760487	Plus, I kind of plan on maybe camping for the PS3.
3760907	3766190	So, I didn't want to try to get too... Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.
3766310	3767791	eBay, eBay, eBay.
3770732	3771433	And that was that.
3771593	3772933	Alright, well, thanks for sharing your story.
3772973	3773654	We appreciate it.
3773934	3774754	That was very nice of you.
3775855	3776115	Alright.
3777056	3778336	How about some more?
3778356	3780998	Anything else you want to say on PS3 pre-orders?
3782818	3783739	Well, I mean...
3784409	3788432	There are going to be more pre-orders, I'm sure, around the world.
3789833	3792695	The whole thing is, it's going to be very hard to come by.
3794296	3795277	Just very, very hard.
3795337	3799640	So if you are looking to get one, try to get it as soon as possible.
3799680	3803462	Because it is going to be like the Xbox 360 was last year.
3803762	3807345	And you might end up having to buy it on eBay if you really want it day one.
3808206	3810187	And to be honest, I would wait.
3810874	3817358	I mean, if it were me, I would wait just because a lot of launch games you may be looking forward to are delayed until next year.
3817519	3822302	So, you know, kind of keep that in mind when you're thinking about pre-ordering it.
3823483	3823903	All right.
3824543	3826445	Let's go on to some more gaming news.
3828346	3838833	Well, speaking of back to the whole Sony camp, there is actually one thing that I am personally excited about coming out on PSP, and that's After Burner.
3840041	3848768	Sega did confirm they have a deal with Planet Moon Studios to do a PSP version, a new one, of Afterburner.
3849089	3852271	So if anyone who was into the original, hey.
3852572	3855654	And there's a quote actually from the CEO of Planet Moon.
3856415	3862320	Most importantly, it's approximately 9,000% more portable than the original arcade cabinet.
3862620	3865142	That just struck me as a stupid quote.
3865785	3869526	But anyway, it's going to be called Afterburner Black Falcon.
3870107	3875909	It will have 19 officially licensed customizable planes, a single player modem, and Wi-Fi multiplayer.
3876729	3878129	And they're slated for spring 2007.
3880930	3884992	And I'd like to mention we also mentioned that back on episode 200.
3885492	3887513	That was also one of the big stories we came out with.
3888113	3889613	I see one of those under the radar things.
3889793	3889974	Yes.
3890654	3891194	All right, well.
3892273	3893113	It's been confirmed.
3893133	3894154	You're not a liar, Loki.
3894194	3894574	Way to go.
3894934	3895214	I know.
3895354	3898215	Full Auto 2 on PSP, March 14th, 2007.
3898715	3900496	Heard it here first.
3900516	3904797	Now, if that's the one that doesn't happen, I'm going to laugh my ass off just to share.
3905177	3906118	Okay.
3906158	3912740	Speaking of Sony things, Eurogamer got a really in-depth look at PlayStation 3, the interface and the online.
3912780	3913200	Check it out.
3913220	3915481	They got a pretty in-depth article over at Eurogamer.net.
3916331	3921855	Some of the highlights from their tour, of course, the PlayStation 3 is going to be using what's called the Cross Media Bar.
3922215	3931961	So if you've played the PSP at all, you're already familiar with how the PS3 is going to be set up, which is kind of interesting that they have that very similar layout between the two.
3931981	3934703	It kind of makes me wonder if the Wii and DS are going to be similar like that too.
3934763	3935103	I don't know.
3935844	3942048	They talk about how you're going to have web browsing on the PlayStation 3, something that the Xbox 360 does not have currently.
3942068	3944029	Hopefully it will have better flash support.
3944804	3946424	and Streaming Media Support.
3947465	3948745	It's got the cell processor.
3948765	3951046	I would imagine it can run this stuff.
3951706	3954726	There's the friends bar and there's different icons there.
3954766	3957627	Your signed in friends show their own icons on the bar there.
3958727	3962788	Other icons would be those that are managing the PlayStation Network account.
3963108	3966689	There's a master account and associated accounts.
3966769	3969190	I'm assuming that's for a family setup there.
3969250	3973851	You could also, with the master account, limit what your kids do on their accounts and how much they can spend
3974198	3977461	on the PlayStation Store, which is another section of the bar.
3977501	3982584	And of course, we all know SingStar is going to be huge on the PlayStation Store right out the gate.
3983085	3988969	So if you want to check out more on the tour of online and what to expect there, check it out at Eurogamer.net.
3989069	3996735	And you know what's funny is the Sony Store that they're going to have on there, no point system like the Microsoft and Nintendo teams are doing.
3997155	4000258	It's just going to be dollars or your currency.
4000738	4002680	So that's kind of interesting, I thought.
4002700	4003160	I don't know.
4003973	4008554	But there's a comment from Mike in the chatroom, Loki is the only one that likes Full Auto.
4009134	4012935	And maybe that's true, maybe that's why nobody else has been reporting on it, because you're the only person that likes Full Auto.
4014116	4016496	So, I didn't care for Afterburner.
4017576	4018857	You know, I still reported on it.
4019497	4023438	To be honest, Oblivion, it was a great game, but eh, it's so.
4024278	4025019	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4045389	4054214	One thing that was kind of interesting, and we talked about it a little bit before about Sony and the rumor that X-Fire is going to be teaming up with them for some online partnership and stuff.
4054234	4058197	And Sony came out and said, no, no, no, that's not true, that's only for one game.
4058277	4059658	Actually, no, it is true.
4059738	4062099	It actually is going to be happening, and it was officially announced.
4062419	4071785	They're going to be using the middleware, or they're going to be kind of teaming up for a middleware solution that's going to be an add-on to the current...
4072213	4072413	X-Fire
4097791	4099532	I actually, I really like X-Fire.
4099553	4101354	I think it's a pretty nice little app.
4101374	4103395	Even if MTV does own it, I really like it.
4103435	4104476	It's a cool little application.
4104596	4106057	So, that should be interesting.
4106097	4109400	I could be some brownie points for the PlayStation 3 as far as I'm concerned.
4109935	4112496	It's going to need as many brownie points as it can get.
4113096	4119537	But as far as the delay circumstances, there's actually a rumor that came out.
4120037	4130520	One of the Spanish gaming sites called Maristation said that Kutaragi warned there would be a shortage of PS3 stock in Japan and North America and that Europe would have to wait even longer than they already are.
4131020	4136241	But a Sony spokesperson has said that that was categorically not true.
4137202	4138022	I love how they always...
4138942	4141083	He was eating grams at the time.
4141123	4141623	It's okay.
4141703	4142243	Exactly.
4142704	4146705	Well, see, it said that he hasn't done any media briefings since the Tokyo Game Show.
4147145	4155569	That's because they had him, you know, chained to his jungle gym in his house so that he wouldn't go run out into traffic and die because they need him.
4158290	4159451	To spread weird rumors.
4160191	4167254	Well, at any rate, Sony's actually planning on shipping 6 million PS3 units on a global scale by...
4167984	4169765	The end of the 2007 fiscal year.
4171206	4171426	Cool.
4172887	4173187	Alright.
4173447	4175648	They can plan it, whether it happens or not, hey.
4177309	4178690	Do you think there will be further delays?
4179890	4180491	Despite all this?
4180511	4181351	I don't doubt it.
4182152	4183873	Possibly if they run into hardware problems.
4184693	4187595	If they run into the overheating problems or anything like that.
4188075	4189616	Something that they didn't foresee.
4190116	4193878	Well, they actually, you remember all those issues they had with the first model PlayStation 2s.
4194118	4196840	Although, amazingly enough, I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2.
4197765	4201567	and I've had it for years and it hasn't had any problems.
4202247	4208210	But a lot of them were having issues with coming off track, overheating.
4208750	4211391	I'm seeing there actually being lots of issues for the PS3.
4211411	4213692	All right.
4214635	4215856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4237182	4241585	Cyro Interactive Very anime-ish looking game, but it's an adventure type game.
4241645	4243266	It's also coming in a limited edition.
4243946	4245767	Everybody's Tennis, also coming out.
4246107	4247268	It's the Korean version, actually.
4247308	4248969	It's coming out on October 19th.
4249249	4251070	Sudoku Master on the PlayStation 2.
4251370	4256694	Should also be noted that various Wild Arms games are coming out in Sony's version of the Best Hits.
4257714	4261937	So you can get that cheaper through your importer if you are looking for games such as that.
4262877	4263918	Coming out on the DS...
4264791	4270934	Um, several games in the Kodomo no Tami no Yomi Kikasi series are coming out.
4271594	4273115	Uh, I'm not sure what type of games those are.
4273135	4273836	Children's something.
4274016	4275997	Yeah, some type of children's game there.
4276037	4276877	Just a miscellaneous.
4276937	4277838	It's by Starfish.
4278238	4279078	Creates this games.
4279939	4280839	Creates these, so.
4281319	4282140	Several games in that series.
4282800	4283520	That's pretty awesome.
4284521	4284621	Uh.
4284641	4287462	Yeah, if I understood any of what I just said, yeah, it would be pretty awesome.
4288783	4290264	Well, anyways.
4290884	4290964	Um.
4292355	4292975	Actually, the U.S.
4293035	4294836	is going to be getting quite a bit of stuff as well.
4295176	4298297	This week is a very good week for games, so lots of good stuff.
4298477	4305139	Including, of course, Bully, the game that's been getting so much controversy lately on PlayStation 2.
4306339	4310220	We have Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception on the PSP.
4310400	4311900	You can get your flight sim on there.
4312661	4318242	If you're looking to get your flight sim on on the PC, Microsoft Flight Simulator X is going to be coming out.
4319408	4325993	as well as Contact on the DS, Destroy All Humans 2 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
4326033	4328155	And the first one was really fun, so I'm looking forward to playing this one.
4329075	4332778	Family Guy on PlayStation 2, PSP, and Xbox.
4333138	4334299	That one actually looks pretty good.
4334579	4339242	I kind of thought that was going to be a crappy, like, kind of a port of a TV show, but it looks pretty good.
4340303	4342205	Nintendogs, Dalmatian and Friends.
4343586	4343966	Why...
4344761	4345622	Why this late in the game?
4345642	4347022	Because people still like the puppies.
4347122	4349764	For those that were too lazy to unlock the Dalmatian in the first one.
4350465	4351965	Not lazy, just had to find the hat.
4353526	4361451	Anyways, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on the 360, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also on the 360.
4361832	4371658	I know Sims 2 Pets will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and DS, as well as SpongeBob Creature from the Krusty Krab on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.
4371998	4372238	Yippee.
4374968	4379091	And then finally, on the PC, we have Battlefield 2142.
4380832	4382614	And that is going to be coming out as well.
4383234	4383935	But you know what?
4385135	4387577	Maybe you just don't have time to go buy a game like that.
4387857	4389398	So we are going to give one away.
4391340	4393461	And how might you be able to do this, to enter in?
4393742	4394682	It's actually pretty simple.
4395323	4402228	All you have to do, and this contest will be running until Wednesday, is go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash BF
4403021	4406343	and 2142 for Battlefield 2142.
4407044	4415609	Just simply enter the contest there and there will be a random drawing on Wednesday and we'll be announcing it in Part A of Episode 205.
4416310	4417491	And they'll be able to get that right away.
4417811	4418932	Yes, they'll be able to get it right away.
4419012	4420973	It's a digital distribution thing.
4420993	4425376	It's a digital download code so you'll be able to download it straight to your PC.
4426136	4430199	So look forward to that and I look forward to giving a full review about the game next week.
4431149	4432950	Now, doesn't Desperate Housewives come out this week?
4433531	4437433	Because I noticed in our chat room, somebody had said they just saw a commercial on VH1.
4437473	4437914	Who said that?
4437954	4439655	I think that was last week, to be honest.
4439695	4440035	Was it?
4440195	4440956	I think it was.
4441256	4444819	Oh, JVmon says, a commercial for the Desperate Housewives video game just aired on VH1.
4446660	4448281	Which means someone's watching Flavor of Love.
4450563	4451063	Shame, shame.
4452196	4452476	Metal Slug!
4452496	4453197	Metal Slug!
4453337	4453937	Metal Slug!
4483356	4487617	King of Fighters, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, more stuff.
4489958	4490238	All right.
4490698	4491159	Down the line.
4491439	4496060	Have fun, you folks over in Europe, playing your renamed version of Bully.
4498661	4499481	What is up with that?
4499521	4500442	I still don't get that.
4500542	4504443	I guess Bully must have a real negative context overseas or something.
4504843	4506744	Could someone please enlighten me from overseas?
4506804	4507764	What's wrong with the word Bully?
4508985	4509285	I don't know.
4510025	4510125	Hmm.
4511752	4516654	This issue has been going back and forth and I'm getting to the point where I just don't care anymore.
4517034	4518475	I guess you could call this a follow-up.
4518555	4524878	Last week we said something about how GameStop was tooting their horn that the Wii demo kiosks were going to be exclusive to their store.
4525138	4525718	Well, guess what?
4526278	4532762	Nintendo of America says, uh-uh, quote, playable Wii setups will be available at a variety of retail outlets.
4533162	4537745	We expect that anyone who wants to try Wii will be able to through multiple different methods.
4538165	4550892	In addition to retail outlets, Wii will be playable at a number of mall tours throughout the company, the nationwide Nintendo Fusion Tour, and other grassroots consumer events, which means Loki was misinformed about this when he told us this
4551553	4552974	GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop
4580718	4581699	Hey, whatever works.
4582119	4589946	Maybe the whole thing, you know, this is kind of, I know this is getting into another story, but maybe the whole thing has to do with interference from lighting.
4591167	4594249	And maybe not being able to control that, and that might have something to do with it.
4595390	4595911	Oh, whatever.
4597012	4598533	I thought that was a bunch of BS, but whatever.
4598833	4599174	Who knows?
4599394	4599754	Whatever.
4599774	4602096	It's just speculation right now.
4602785	4610467	Well, an interesting rumor has come out about the Wii console is that it might actually be running Linux already.
4610747	4611107	Ha!
4613268	4624391	So for those folks that love to install Linux on new things, whether it be, you know, the Nintendo DS, the PSP, a toaster, a Billy Bass, whatever the hell, you know.
4625816	4626956	Too bad, Nintendo beat you to it.
4626996	4627797	Yes, exactly.
4628057	4639520	Apparently, a Nintendo insider who blogs under the internet moniker Kiyoshi Saruwatari That means something about monkey.
4640360	4645861	Anyways, claims that the Wii console will run an open source Linux OS.
4646602	4648662	And, of course, that hasn't been confirmed.
4648822	4654964	It's purely speculation right now, but it's basically used for the back end of
4656205	4660287	Using the software for porting stuff in there like the Opera browser and stuff like that.
4661168	4666151	And it says it will be closed and will only allow signed code.
4666191	4670933	But of course, anyone that remembers that kind of stuff knows that people break that pretty quick.
4671694	4671954	Good.
4672114	4673555	Use it to break the region lock.
4673695	4678237	That's the first thing I want you Linux nerds to work on if this is indeed true and the Wii already has it on there.
4678537	4681259	I want you to work on the region lock in case there's, you know...
4681744	4683486	OhAndDon for the Wii.
4683586	4684707	I want that shit imported.
4685248	4686068	ASAP.
4686249	4686629	Thank you.
4686709	4692054	Could you imagine OhAndDon on the Wii?
4692335	4694217	I'm thinking about it and I'm wearing a warm smile.
4694977	4697520	Well, as far as other things that are... Oh, and hold on.
4697580	4698701	I'd like to... Sorry.
4699522	4700823	And I hate having to read these.
4701183	4702104	Bad Transition.
4702365	4703506	Five points from Gryffindor.
4703546	4703606	Hey!
4704688	4708789	I was on my way to a very wonderful transition.
4709049	4718211	And this will be the last story that we have from Kiyoshi Saruwati because apparently the whole thing was a practical joke made up by him to get spread around the world.
4718911	4721192	So that will be next from the podcast.
4721392	4722092	Thank you very much.
4722152	4724013	So you just made up the last five minutes.
4724133	4725093	Oh no, I'm keeping that in.
4726413	4728874	Okay, I am reporting the news, okay?
4729154	4732175	I said it was purely speculation and this is what this guy said.
4732395	4733495	It's all his fault, not mine.
4734704	4735525	I just report the news.
4735565	4736486	I think that's funny.
4736506	4737368	Don't shoot the messenger.
4738249	4739530	I think that's really freaking funny.
4740592	4742234	Well, there's five minutes of my life I won't get back.
4742494	4745959	Speaking of things that I also think are funny is not really the story.
4747739	4758851	Nintendo has announced a launch of LiveMove, which is a development tool to make it easy to produce titles for the Wii easier and faster.
4759452	4768762	It was made by, I guess that would be iLive, artificial intelligence specialists.
4770347	4776848	At any rate, it's supposed to help allow a developer to train the Wii Remote just by performing motions.
4777568	4788210	To quote on here from iLive's chairman, Wei Yan, LiveMove will allow the game industry to move away from indirect digital control to more natural analog control for the first time.
4789991	4796512	Genyo Takeda, who's Nintendo's senior MD of Integrated Research and Development, said,
4797828	4809395	basically, um, said, when Nintendo's development team saw a live move, we instantly recognized how easy it would greatly increase our ability to explore and experiment with new concepts and make our lives easier.
4810315	4813137	So, I'm looking to see how, uh, what they can come up with that.
4813497	4814578	They've made some, uh,
4815569	4820452	Another quote on here, actually, that I think was really cool is, this revolutionary tool liberates the imaginations of game creators.
4820792	4835941	Which I think, actually, the whole concept of having something that you can use free motion to actually program with, I think really just links very well to the whole mission behind the Wii.
4835981	4839503	So you have innovative games, but you have innovative development going with it.
4840184	4840364	All right.
4840916	4848781	Well, maybe some developers that want to see what's coming up in Nintendo's world might want to check out the Nintendo Space World Show.
4848861	4850803	Of course, the Nintendo World Show for short.
4851323	4856687	It's going to be November 3rd in Nagoya and November 12th in Osaka.
4857247	4860489	And that was from Nintendo's official Japan site.
4861670	4864872	So check it out if you're over in Japan and want to check out what Nintendo's up to.
4864912	4866874	Because remember, they don't do Tokyo Game Show.
4866954	4868595	So this is kind of their version of that.
4869414	4870314	That's pretty awesome.
4870354	4873315	There will be, of course, hands-on Wii demos and new DS games.
4873855	4874535	I want to go.
4875315	4877936	Anyways, well, start saving those pennies quick.
4878916	4885097	Well, some interesting stuff that they're doing with the GameCube version of Twilight Princess in Japan.
4885418	4889478	It's only being offered online, kind of similar to what they do with Electroplankton over here.
4890539	4896200	The main reason Nintendo is doing this is to avoid both versions of the game in stores at the same time because of the Wii launch.
4896755	4903996	They would much rather see the Wii Zelda sell than the GameCube version and that wouldn't be a guarantee if the two versions are on the same shelf.
4904416	4909917	There is no information on whether this same procedure will be passed on to Europe and the US as well.
4911298	4911758	Interesting.
4912698	4914958	Yeah, it'll be interesting to see if they do that in the US as well.
4915078	4915878	I don't think they will.
4916078	4919999	I think there's a lot more demand for the old GameCube games here.
4920039	4924860	I think there's a lot of folks that buy the earlier generations of consoles because they're cheaper.
4925879	4927939	So I think they'll still be on shelves out here.
4927959	4928419	And you know what?
4928439	4931420	I mean, some people might not want to use the Wii to play Zelda.
4932520	4937621	Well, wasn't there an old story that said you could plug in the old GameCube controller and use that on the Wii version still?
4938061	4938441	I don't know.
4938641	4938881	Maybe.
4939922	4940982	Actually, it's kind of funny.
4941022	4944522	I had a discussion with Dan about this not too long ago.
4944922	4949503	He said that he's actually thinking about just picking it up on GameCube anyway instead of on Wii.
4949823	4951584	Just for the hell of it or just because of the controls?
4951604	4952644	Just because the control...
4954125	4966431	Instead of a few things changed from the E3 demo version that I wasn't too happy with, like not being able to use the remote actually for the sword at all, you have to slash.
4967612	4967972	Oh, weird.
4968232	4969733	And I was like, no, I don't like that.
4969853	4971994	So we're probably just getting it on GameCube.
4972014	4973255	All right.
4975056	4979198	Well, or you might just have both because you're a whore for Link like that, right?
4980988	4981950	Well, I don't know.
4982530	4983672	I didn't play Wind Waker.
4984473	4985434	I refuse to play Wind Waker.
4985875	4989099	Well, that's a different... That's fake, cartoony Link.
4989139	4990020	That's not the real deal.
4992028	5003311	Alright, well that is about going to wrap it up for our Part A, but you know, over the past few weeks, we have not been able to end Part A of Orange Lounge Radio until we get to some DDR previews, and that's what we're going to do right now.
5003691	5009153	We're going to take a look at some new tracks here from DDR Universe and DDR Ultramix 4.
5009493	5013534	These are new Dance Dance Revolution games coming out from Konami a little bit later this year.
5013854	5014494	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
5041591	5042832	Thanks for watching!
5067507	5068628	We are connected.
5097825	5099791	Thanks for watching!
5130521	5133883	Walk with me through the universe.
5160192	5166777	and along the way, see how all of us are connected.
5166937	5178105	Feast the eyes of your soul, on the love that abounds, in all places at once, seemingly endless, like your own existence in stillness.
5180547	5183068	We are connected We are connected
5209012	5210013	Thank you for watching!
5247018	5247699	Outro Music
5277674	5281496	That was Jondi and Spech here on the DDR Sneak Peeks with We Are Connected.
5281536	5283217	That's going to be coming to DDR Universe.
5283557	5285578	Keep in mind that will be cut down a little bit, though.
5285618	5290961	That was the full version you heard, and DDR songs tend to be about a minute and a half to a minute and 45 in length.
5291321	5292041	So check that out.
5292382	5300226	And our old buddy, DJ Morpheus, who's in chat right now, the one and only from UndersedationLive.org, made it funny in the chat.
5300246	5302487	He said Stephen Hawking is on vocals in that song.
5302827	5304448	So you're crazy.
5304955	5306776	Alright, anyway, let's go to another song here.
5306856	5309738	This is from DDR Ultramix 4.
5310599	5314822	And this is a song by Wave Group featuring Scotty D. And of course you know Wave Group.
5314862	5317324	They've done some of those cover songs that were in Beatmania.
5317644	5320346	And we've played other songs by them previously during this promotion.
5320706	5322448	Well they have a song and it's a little bit jazzy.
5322488	5324069	It's called Stompin' at the Gotham.
5324109	5328332	And it's the next song we're going to play here on the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.
5328789	5329750	Thanks for watching!
5365123	5366290	Thanks for watching!
5402907	5403757	Keep it going!
5427628	5431093	Stop into the Gotham here on the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.
5431213	5431974	That was a fun one.
5432495	5433937	Nice big band sound to that.
5434017	5434738	That was very fun.
5434918	5435579	That was a fun one.
5435599	5436601	That'll be cool to play in DDR.
5437426	5438406	Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peeks
5493039	5496798	Forever in the sky, forever young, you're working well
5559879	5566632	Coming soon to Dance Dance Revolution Universe Day Behavior with Close Your Eyes the Activated Mix here on Orange Lounge Radio
5567731	5568191	Zetsubou Tekida
5597259	5598020	So check it out.
5598240	5602605	It's Zetsubou Tekida here on Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks.
5701511	5710177	Alright, here on Orange Lounge Radio by Nico Girard, that is Zetsubou Tekida, or at least I think that's how you pronounce it, but watch it be like some crazy thing where the Z is silent, I don't know.
5710497	5720204	But that's coming to DDR Ultramix 4, and possibly Beatmania 2DX someday, I don't know, that's kind of how I think that song is, very 2DX-ish song.
5720324	5722466	That song had no imagination whatsoever.
5722746	5723006	Really?
5723106	5723927	Not a fan of that song?
5725088	5725288	No.
5725368	5725528	Well...
5726058	5727318	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
