0	20880	Today, October 15th, 2006, more details on the E3 Makeover, PlayStation 3 and Wii's are
20880	26120	pre-ordered around the nation, and what are the annoying things about the next game generation?
26120	32840	Orange Lounge Radio
32840	38280	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge
38280	39320	Radio.
39320	44440	We are that internet radio program dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and the
44440	45440	gamer lifestyle.
45440	47420	We talk about all sorts of games.
47420	51300	We try to avoid those that suck but, you know, once in a while we've got to talk about games
51300	54760	that suck because we have to tell you to stay the hell away from them.
54760	55760	And I'm here to help you do that.
55760	56760	My name is Rob Roberts.
56760	57760	You might know me as Sky.
57760	60760	Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.
60760	61760	Hi.
61760	62760	Welcome back.
62760	64000	I am back, aren't I?
64000	67080	Yes, you were off at the Mouse House last week.
67080	68080	For a day.
68080	70320	I was actually, I came back for a funeral.
70320	71320	Oh, that's right.
71320	72320	That's right.
72320	73320	You were, I remember now, so.
73320	77520	And then I fell into a coma for eight hours because I have a sinus infection.
77520	79000	I'm sorry to hear that.
79000	80000	So sick Jamie's back.
80000	81000	Yeah.
81000	83800	Those folks that have been listening to the podcast for a long time know that Jamie was
83800	85960	sick for a while.
85960	90080	And it started from a sinus infection, so like my doctors all like, okay, pick your
90080	91080	antibiotic.
91080	94560	I'm like, I get to choose?
94560	99480	So I'm on erythromycin, which hates my whole digestive system.
99480	102400	I prefer C-Pro, just five tablets, but that's just me.
102400	104080	Anyway, sorry, we're not The Drug Show.
104080	105080	We're Orange Lounge Radio.
105080	106080	Aren't we Loki?
106080	107080	Tech Master Loki is also here.
107080	108080	Yes.
108080	109080	Yes.
109080	110080	How you doing?
110080	111080	Yes, we're not The Drug Show.
111080	112080	I like your shirt.
112080	113320	You have a me and my Katamari shirt on.
113320	114320	Yes.
114320	115320	You know, I never played that on PSP.
115320	116440	I just kind of missed it.
116440	118400	Like I know I was looking forward to it and then I was kind of like, eh.
118400	120160	I played it a little bit and got bored.
120160	121160	Did you?
121160	122160	Really quick.
122160	124380	Was it just not, it was not the same on the little screen?
124380	128620	The lack of a second analog stick cramps my hand up very badly.
128620	133880	And so it was just like kind of Metroid Prime Hunter Syndrome where, you know, you just
133880	137760	have to stop playing because it hurts your hand and it's just not, I don't know.
137760	142640	It's like trying to control a car with a brick or something instead of a steering wheel.
142640	143640	I don't know.
143640	145920	I actually got the urge to play Katamari Damacy yesterday.
145920	149000	I was lying on the couch kind of just, you know, having one of those lazy days where
149000	152640	I'm not going to move from this spot and then I'm looking over at my game collection which
152640	157040	is, you know, kind of next to the TV and then I'm like, I want to roll over things.
157040	161600	I want to play Katamari Damacy.
161600	163400	There's something very stress relieving about that game.
163400	164400	I can't explain it.
164400	166840	We get that feeling every day during work.
166840	168400	That's why we have to have our killing breaks.
168400	169400	I see.
169400	170560	Hence the Liberty City stories.
170560	171560	Yes.
171560	175000	We'll be here Gaming Week in just a minute, but I do want to introduce an old favorite
175000	178840	of ours that's sitting here tonight on the ground hacking something on the computer over
178840	179840	there.
179840	180840	Say hello to Miklotov.
180840	183640	It's called chatting online, not hacking.
183640	184640	What are you chatting on?
184640	186640	It's not our chat room.
186640	189000	No, it's just like instant messenger.
189000	190000	I see.
190000	191360	So you're talking to people better than our listeners.
191360	192360	Yeah, just some coworkers.
192360	193360	Oh, okay.
193360	197960	Well, if you want to join our chat room, www.orangelauntrader.com, click on chat.
197960	200400	Miklotov will be here for a little bit, but you're not going to be here for the whole
200400	201400	show, right?
201400	203920	You have a train or a bus to catch or something?
203920	204920	Yeah, something like that.
204920	205920	All right.
205920	207240	Don't say train.
207240	209120	What's wrong with trains?
209120	211880	Because I told you what I've been listening to all week.
211880	215280	Oh, I'm going to be riding a train very soon, actually.
215280	216280	It's kind of...
216280	218720	If I hear any more Guns N' Roses, I'm going to shoot myself.
218720	223320	All right, well, I suppose we should start talking about the Gaming Weeks, starting off
223320	224320	with Dark Sakura.
224320	225320	How was your Gaming Week?
225320	231380	Full of Guns N' Roses pinball, apparently, because my hubby has seen fit to play a lot
231380	233520	and lots of Guns N' Roses pinballs.
233520	238920	So I either come home to Welcome to the Jungle or Night Train or My Michelle.
238920	240200	And where I love old school...
240200	242280	My Michelle rocks, just for the record.
242280	243280	Yeah.
243280	250440	Where I love Guns N' Roses, there's so much I can hear of Night Train, because Dan always
250440	253500	gets to that level and then music somehow gets louder.
253500	258400	And the thing is, it's like synthesized guitar and everything, like listening to a Super
258400	262800	Nintendo with Axl, you know, all fuzzy over it.
262800	265480	I was like, dude, no.
265480	275800	And I made myself an Xbox Live account, and so I have my own gamertag now.
275800	277800	After all this time, you finally made your own damn account?
277800	278800	Because of the PSU demo.
278800	279800	Yeah.
279800	280800	Which I haven't played yet.
280800	281800	I just downloaded it.
281800	282800	Okay.
282800	286720	But for anyone who wants to know, oh my god, I'm going to regret this.
286720	288520	Go to the forums and look it up.
288520	292160	Yeah, go to the forums and look it up, because I posted it on the gamertag.
292160	294640	See then it's a free advertisement for the forums.
294640	295840	There you go.
295840	301200	And then, this doesn't have to do with anything about, well, actually playing a game, but
301200	305560	it made me think of it since you guys were talking about Katamari, is I had a dream on
305560	309040	like Thursday night that I was rolling a Katamari over my work.
309040	312400	You remember the last time I had dreams about that, right?
312400	313880	I left that job.
313880	314880	Really?
314880	315880	To another one.
315880	316880	Yeah.
316880	317880	Makes me think of that ad that was on.
317880	321520	I think it was for like a bank or credit card or something that showed the Katamari rolling
321520	322920	down the hills in San Francisco.
322920	327800	I mean, the ad agency denied it was inspired by Katamari, but that's what any gamer would
327800	331360	think about when they see that commercial is, oh, ha ha, Katamari.
331360	337480	Actually, I still have the parody that I made from when I worked at the student loan place,
337480	339560	so I'll post it up in the chat room.
339560	341040	All right.
341040	342040	Yeah.
342040	343880	Loki, how was your gaming week?
343880	345600	It was okay.
345600	346880	What did I play?
346880	349000	I didn't play a whole lot.
349000	352920	More Saints Row, because that games are really fun.
352920	360040	I finally stole a Titan, which is an armored car with money in it, and I have been performing
360040	365400	the wonderful money duping glitch that's in the game where you can basically blow this
365400	369680	car up over and over collecting the money in it and buying it over again.
369680	370680	Fun stuff.
370680	374760	Grand Theft Auto, of course, Liberty City Stories, still waiting for Vice City Stories.
374760	378640	Only a few more weeks, a few more weeks, then we can switch games, finally.
378640	381880	And then, other than that, really not a whole lot.
381880	386160	I was meaning to set up my PlayStation 2 and play some games on that, but I need to buy
386160	389760	a VGA cable for it so I can hook it up to my computer because, unfortunately, Nelly
389760	391940	wants to hog the TV with Zuma.
391940	392940	And so, you know...
392940	393940	But she's not a gamer.
393940	395540	No, not at all.
395540	397480	She's a single gamer, I guess.
397480	402260	But so, yeah, unfortunately, I can't really play the games on there, so I have to wait
402260	403260	for that.
403260	408160	I'm packing because I'm moving next week, so that kind of puts a damper on playing games
408160	409160	and stuff.
409160	412280	But I did play a little bit of Dig Dug, which is kind of neat because that came out this
412280	413280	week.
413280	414280	I don't know.
414280	415280	It's just Dig Dug.
415280	416900	I mean, what do you expect?
416900	421240	And then, tried a little bit more of Need for Speed Carbon.
421240	422800	The demo's pretty awesome, actually.
422800	424960	I'm pretty impressed with it so far.
424960	430400	So may need to check that out once the game finally makes its way out here.
430400	433980	And then, of course, I know there's some...I tried playing the multiplayer demo of Splinter
433980	439400	Cell, Double Agent, but unfortunately, at the time, I was torrenting a bunch of stuff
439400	442680	and Xbox Live didn't like that too much.
442680	445520	So I'll have to try that next week.
445520	449560	I think that's about all I played, yeah.
449560	450960	All right.
450960	453320	My gaming week, a lot of the old standbys.
453320	458600	I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, a little more progress in Enchanted Arms.
458600	460000	New stuff I checked out this week, though.
460000	466960	I downloaded Dig Dug when it came out on Wednesday, because out of the old Namco classics that
466960	472840	have been released recently, Pac-Man and Galaga, I would say Dig Dug's my favorite.
472840	474920	It was just always my favorite a long time ago.
474920	479280	I remember playing the game a hell of a lot on Commodore 64 and at a local pizza place
479280	483980	when local pizza places had a lot of good arcade games.
483980	485400	So it was cool.
485400	488580	It was kind of a little bit of memories.
488580	492480	I have to admit, though, I'm a little bit disappointed, as I'm sure most Xbox fans are
492480	496280	feeling, is that it seems like we've just had nothing but a barrage over the past couple
496280	500440	months of rehashed old classic games, and we're really looking forward to some of the
500440	507000	new stuff, Lumines, Castle Crashers, all this other stuff that's supposed to be coming out.
507000	510280	I believe I heard somewhere that Xbox has their stuff.
510280	514960	I want to say when we did the story last week about Duke Nukem, the possibilities of that
514960	519240	coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, they had said that Xbox Live has its calendar full through
519240	522360	the end of the year, or something like that, and it's kind of like, why aren't we seeing
522360	526040	releases every week, or why aren't we seeing more homegrown stuff?
526040	529600	Why can't they release more than one game a week?
529600	530600	Is that so difficult?
530600	531600	I don't know.
531600	532600	I mean, seriously.
532600	533600	I don't know.
533600	539520	But yeah, Dig Dug, yay, another classic game, not so yay, but for the value of $5, you can't
539520	540520	really complain.
540520	546960	It's got really easy achievements if you're into hoarding up the achievements, and unfortunately
546960	551520	no multiplayer or any of that stuff, but it's Dig Dug.
551520	554960	Either you remember it from your childhood and you love it, or you'll download the demo
554960	560540	and think, oh, another 1980s game that I may or may not buy, depending on how much nostalgia
560540	562580	means to me.
562580	566320	Going from something very nostalgic to something very new, it's kind of nostalgic in a way.
566320	572720	I also played Mortal Kombat Armageddon on PlayStation 2, which is the clusterfuck Mortal
572720	574560	Kombat, so to speak.
574560	580840	Every single character who was ever in a Mortal Kombat game, except for one obscure, you don't
580840	585200	even remember this chick, but most every single character's in it.
585200	587320	Did you try the Mario Kart type game?
587320	588320	I did.
588320	590520	The Motor Kombat, or whatever it's called?
590520	591520	It's cheesy.
591520	593620	I mean, don't expect...
593620	595080	It's not a racing game.
595080	597120	Mortal Kombat Armageddon was not designed to be a racing game.
597120	600160	It's definitely something extra they tacked on.
600160	602800	It's cute, it's fun, but it'll get old fast.
602800	605760	The tracks are very simple in design.
605760	611800	They're very, very simple, and each kart only really has one attack that it does, depending
611800	613360	on which character you are.
613360	618280	For instance, Johnny Cage will launch a green bomb onto the track in front of him so he
618280	619760	can hit guys in front of you.
619760	621720	Melina does a boost type thing.
621720	623920	It's a very simple game.
623920	625840	This is not a replacement for Mario Kart.
625840	628720	It's just something extra to giggle at for a few minutes.
628720	632400	The game itself is based off the engine of the previous games.
632400	638480	Unfortunately, I do feel they had to dumb it down a little bit to fit all of the characters,
638480	641440	just the massive characters they have in this game.
641440	646760	Each character now only has one fighting style and a weapon, but you get a fair tradeoff
646760	650840	because now you have the create a character mode, although essentially what I noticed
650840	655880	in create a character mode is, costumes aside, pretty much everything else you're buying,
655880	658680	you're just buying bits and pieces of what the other characters already have.
658680	660540	But it's still kind of neat.
660540	664600	Some folks like the Barbie mode in their fighting games, so it's kind of fun.
664600	669640	I would say if you like the previous Mortal Kombat games, you're probably going to like
669640	676620	this one too, but as far as entry level Mortal Kombat games go, as far as fighting, I actually
676620	679040	think I kind of preferred the last one a little bit, but I don't know.
679040	681600	Actually I haven't gotten to play this one in depth enough yet.
681600	684520	I'll be honest, I didn't even get a chance to check out Conquest mode, which I wanted
684520	685520	to.
685520	686520	I heard it short though.
686520	690000	But I really liked the last one, and it was pretty intricate with the fighting styles
690000	694160	because you had combos that would chain from one style to another to the weapon.
694160	698920	Well, the last one technically was Shell and Monks, so that wasn't really a Mortal Kombat
698920	699920	game.
699920	700920	No, not that one.
700920	701920	The one before it.
701920	702920	Deception.
702920	703920	Deception, yeah.
703920	704920	I actually think I kind of preferred that one.
704920	706480	So what if it didn't have the big cluster of characters?
706480	711000	I've had enough to keep the game fresh and moving.
711000	715240	But if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, this is definitely fan service.
715240	718000	I would say the other disappointing thing about this game is I'm kind of surprised it's
718000	719960	not next gen.
719960	723280	I think if they went next gen with it, then maybe they could have squeezed all that stuff
723280	724280	into it.
724280	726640	Of course, it probably would have been in development for another year, but I don't
726640	727640	know.
727640	728840	They're probably working on one.
728840	729840	It's not bad.
729840	735360	If we're fighting, considering the amount of variety you get with this game, it's actually
735360	736360	pretty good.
736360	738640	It's a fighting game itself.
738640	745640	I feel a game like Soul Calibur II or III even is much more intricate in the fighting
745640	752560	styles, whereas this is just variety, fan service, just throwing tons of different things
752560	753560	at you.
753560	756840	So take it as you will.
756840	757840	And then that's about it.
757840	759160	One other thing, but we'll get to that later.
759160	763200	So I'll ask Miklotov, how was your gaming week?
763200	769000	My gaming week was pretty good, shockingly, since I'm not only playing Final Fantasy XI
769000	770240	anymore.
770240	776280	This week I played a good amount of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Luminous Live on Xbox
776280	777280	Live.
777280	778280	Wait a minute.
778280	779280	Wait a minute.
779280	780600	How come the rest of us haven't gotten a chance to play that?
780600	783520	Because you guys don't use Microsoft's network.
783520	784520	Oh, I see.
784520	785520	You're special.
785520	786520	I'm special.
786520	787520	Okay.
787520	790240	And I had a great time with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
790240	792060	Luminous Live, not so much.
792060	797120	The 360 controller really, really, really sucks for that game.
797120	801880	I also picked up three new games this week.
801880	807760	I picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and that's kind of boring, but it got me through
807760	812400	the Wii pre-order line on Friday.
812400	817160	I also picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner, and that's a really, really neat
817160	818160	game.
818160	819560	I'm not too far in it.
819560	825320	And I picked up Mortal Kombat Armageddon, and I think it's a decent game, but they screwed
825320	827900	up Rain, and he was my favorite character.
827900	831520	So I was not too happy about that.
831520	836740	Other than that, haven't really played much else, I guess, except for what we'll be talking
836740	838160	about later.
838160	840920	So that's about it.
840920	846600	Other questions in chat room, the always present extra guest on our show, orangelaunchradio.com,
846600	847600	click on chat.
847600	852120	Jeremy Todd 1 asks, Miklotov, so you're saying the shitty 360 controller's D-pad works good
852120	854220	for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3?
854220	859280	Actually yeah, because you can perform the rolling moves, like down to forward and stuff
859280	862000	like that, really easily.
862000	868960	So yeah, I would say it works pretty well for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
868960	872760	How about the lag in the game, because I know that was something that was a bitch with Street
872760	877680	Fighter 2, and I was just wondering if they fixed that kind of stuff.
877680	879400	I didn't notice any lag, honestly.
879400	880400	It was really nice.
880400	884060	Yeah, but wouldn't it be harder to judge on your network, though, because that's like
884060	886120	a different thing than the public thing?
886120	887120	That's true.
887120	888400	So I mean, it might be different on the public.
888400	891600	I think we got some pretty bad lag, though, when we were playing Street Fighter before
891600	893600	it came out, also.
893600	894760	Interesting.
894760	899080	There was another comment in chat room, Blaze said, Skye, the original Mortal Kombat never
899080	900080	had the variety.
900080	901080	It's a true throwback.
901080	905320	Yeah, I guess, but you know, your expectation level of fighting games was different back
905320	906320	then.
906320	908920	But then again, come to think of it, that was kind of one of Mortal Kombat's weaknesses
908920	909920	in the beginning.
909920	915720	I mean, yeah, it had fatalities, but the first one, as great of a game as it is, it is a
915720	917680	little clunky, especially on the Genesis.
917680	920560	How would you like to create a fatality mode in that?
920560	923120	Oh yeah, that was the other thing about the game that bothered me.
923120	924600	You don't really create a fatality.
924600	928840	You just kind of do these, when it goes finish him, you just start doing like, tor tor square,
928840	933000	a way toward X, you just start doing all this random stuff, and they'll do all these types
933000	934040	of random things.
934040	938360	Some of them are kind of funny, like one fatality I watched Miklotov do, he ripped somebody's
938360	943040	arms off and then knocked their face off with the arms, which is kind of funny, but the
943040	947260	only problem with that is that once you've kind of gone through that, there actually
947260	949760	isn't this level of variety that you'd think.
949760	953840	I think it was a lot cooler when everybody kind of had their own unique thing they did,
953840	957960	but I understand, again, 60-something characters, it's probably harder to do that, so that's
957960	959320	why they had to go here.
959320	963680	And like I was talking earlier to you about it, I don't think it's totally just that,
963680	968800	it fits with the overall game's theme where everybody's just kind of rushing towards trying
968800	973480	to get this power, and you know, it's not so much a tournament anymore as it's, let's
973480	977340	just quickly kill as many people as we can so we can get farther than everybody else
977340	978840	and get this power.
978840	982400	I do like the fact that maybe the unlock's a lot easier in this game, you don't have
982400	987480	the red, green, blue, grey coins, you just have coins, period, and then you know what
987480	990960	you're unlocking before you do it, unlike the crypt where you had to open up a coffin
990960	995160	and hope it had something good, unless you were cheating using GameFAQs, so anyway.
995160	1001320	Anyway, enough about my gaming week, let's get into some housekeeping news.
1001320	1006240	There's actually not going to be a live show next week, we're going to pre-tape number
1006240	1010480	205, that's because two of us are going to be out of town next Sunday, so there's not
1010480	1014960	going to be a live show on Sunday, I believe we're going to pre-tape Wednesday night at
1014960	1020040	this point, it's going to replace the usual guys on a show that you hear on the live station
1020040	1024520	only here on Wednesday night, so we will be pre-taping live.
1024520	1028620	There is, though, something I'm going to bring back that happened at Disneyland, or I should
1028620	1031400	say didn't happen, no one found me.
1031400	1032640	Well, it's a big place.
1032640	1033640	Yeah.
1033640	1040960	But I'm going to be at YowieCon this, next weekend, and I will be cosplaying as an Organization
1040960	1043160	13 member, so you will see me.
1043160	1044160	Nerd!
1044160	1045760	Chris and Megsy are doing it, too.
1045760	1046760	Nerds!
1046760	1048600	I know, but we're cute nerds.
1048600	1052440	So we are going to be in the big trench coats with stuff.
1052440	1058500	If you find me, then you will get a CD sampler.
1058500	1060080	Some CDs from a different drum.
1060080	1061080	Yeah.
1061080	1067560	Yeah, we have little three-inch singles, Rain Dancer with Come With Me and Rupesh Cartel,
1067560	1071880	Death with Soft Names, but one of the B-sides on that single is Yours to Command, which
1071880	1077600	is one of the new Ditter songs that we premiered earlier on in the DDR preview segment.
1077600	1084720	So if you find me, if I'm not completely fawning over the Yowie action, then you get
1084720	1085720	a present.
1085720	1087520	I was going to say the man-gina.
1087520	1092820	But I will also make this disclaimer, and I'm going to be singing Nightmare Before Christmas
1092820	1101000	in 3-D at the Metreon on Friday night, and I will extend it there if somebody recognizes
1101000	1104680	me, you get the CD.
1104680	1106480	If not at YowieCon, then at the Metreon.
1106480	1109640	I worry maybe I should give you some more, because there might be a lot of our listeners
1109640	1110640	at YowieCon.
1110640	1111640	I'll tell you what.
1111640	1112640	First three people.
1112640	1113640	How's that?
1113640	1114640	We got a lot of these.
1114640	1115640	We got a lot of these.
1115640	1116640	So there you go.
1116640	1119520	Two other ones for YowieCon, one is for Nightmare Before Christmas.
1119520	1121440	There you go.
1121440	1122440	Right there.
1122440	1123440	Three pairs to give away.
1123440	1124440	Have fun.
1124440	1131600	All right, so go find Dark Sakura at YowieCon.
1131600	1136160	I thought she already had one.
1136160	1137160	That's all right.
1137160	1138160	She wants to keep one for herself.
1138160	1139160	I see how it is.
1139160	1140160	That's fine.
1140160	1141640	I actually forgot that I already had one, but oh well.
1141640	1142640	That's all right.
1142640	1143640	Have fun.
1143640	1146720	Give those singles away.
1146720	1148560	I will be traveling as well this weekend.
1148560	1150520	This is the weekend where I'm finally going to New York City.
1150520	1154960	Yes, I missed Digital Life by one whole week because I'm just cool like that.
1154960	1161040	I will be in New York City this weekend, and I took some listeners' advice and scheduled
1161040	1163840	a time to be at the Nintendo World Store.
1163840	1165800	Now here's the thing.
1165800	1170080	I haven't exactly cleared it with them or anything, and I'm not expecting a swarm of
1170080	1171080	people.
1171080	1175720	We don't exactly have that many people listening to the program, but I will be there Saturday
1175720	1178640	at noon, so come look for me at the Nintendo World Store.
1178640	1179640	You know what?
1179640	1181920	I have friends, too, so they can come find me.
1181920	1183760	So it's a West Coast-East Coast thing.
1183760	1186120	You can come find Jamie on the West Coast, and you can come find me on the East Coast.
1186120	1188120	So you can find some more.
1188120	1189120	Exactly.
1189120	1192360	So that will be Saturday at noon at the Nintendo World Store.
1192360	1193360	I will be there.
1193360	1195200	And Loki, you can find on his couch all weekend long.
1195200	1208400	I'll be on my couch at my house, and I will have a CD in case you find me, just in case.
1208400	1210360	Mikl Tov, will you be anywhere for the fans to meet?
1210360	1212040	Actually, no one knows what you look like, anyway.
1212040	1213040	Yeah, they don't.
1213040	1219160	I'll be at work, probably, so if you find me at work, I'll give you a high-five, because
1219160	1220160	I don't have CDs.
1220160	1221160	All right.
1221160	1222160	Sounds good.
1222160	1226520	Actually, I should, because the picture on the form is sort of outdated.
1226520	1233000	My hair is dyed red now with black streaks in the front, so it will probably be straight,
1233000	1234000	not curly.
1234000	1236200	Yeah, you look a little different than you do in the album art that you see on iTunes,
1236200	1238680	like when you download, because that picture is like six months old.
1238680	1240000	More than that.
1240000	1241880	We did those pictures last winter.
1241880	1242880	Wow.
1242880	1243880	Long time.
1243880	1244880	We need new ones.
1244880	1245880	It's time for new pictures.
1245880	1246880	New ones.
1246880	1247880	All right.
1247880	1249640	But if anyone looks at my DeviantArt account on my Deviant tag, that's what my hair looks
1249640	1250640	like.
1250640	1252680	All right.
1252680	1254040	So come find us.
1254040	1258600	New York City, Saturday, YALIcon, Metreon, all weekend long.
1258600	1260960	Orange Orange Radio invades coast to coast.
1260960	1263920	DDR previews a little bit later on in this segment.
1263920	1268480	Two new songs from Ultramix 4 and two new songs from DDR Universe tonight.
1268480	1270280	But first, some gaming news.
1270280	1271280	Yes.
1271280	1272280	Lots of gaming news.
1272280	1279840	And of course, you know, like every year, we were looking forward to E3, keyword is
1279840	1280840	were.
1280840	1288320	Unfortunately, E3, as announced last, well, actually earlier this year, it's been downsized.
1288320	1294240	So yeah, unfortunately we won't be able to see this wonderful giant expo with 60,000
1294240	1295960	plus people in it.
1295960	1299800	And well anyways, here's the details on what's going to be happening with this.
1299800	1302880	It's now being called the E3 Media and Business Summit.
1302880	1310720	It will take place between July 11th and the 13th in Santa Monica, California.
1310720	1316880	And they're actually going to be taking up several hotels as well as the large Barker
1316880	1322760	Hanger, which is going to be kind of a show floor type thing, I don't know.
1322760	1326760	I guess a place that they can use to demonstrate stuff, basically.
1326760	1328720	And it's going to be invite only.
1328720	1335840	And basically, according to Doug Lowenstein, this is kind of how he's summing up the whole
1335840	1336840	E3.
1336840	1338820	E3 is not a place where product is sold anymore.
1338820	1344240	The industry is recognized as a big part of mainstream culture.
1344240	1348360	So the need for a big glittering event to validate the industry is not what it used
1348360	1349700	to be.
1349700	1355940	What is needed is to focus on the fact that E3 is going to be much more about media related
1355940	1357400	opportunities.
1357400	1362240	The question is, what is the most efficient way to create those opportunities?
1362240	1364640	Here's my question to Doug Lowenstein there.
1364640	1372320	When you say media, do you mean media or the people that have TV shows and giant multi
1372320	1378680	million dollar websites because talking with some of the other publishers out there, that
1378680	1379680	seems to be the case.
1379680	1382360	They just kind of want to ignore the smaller guys.
1382360	1387220	So just remember that the smaller guys do have a reach out there in the marketplace
1387220	1390840	and do contact your customers.
1390840	1396160	So take that in mind when you're picking those select thousands of people that are going
1396160	1399380	to be at this event.
1399380	1403560	So that whole thing where he says there's no need for E3 to be the glittering event
1403560	1408300	it once was, he's basically saying, Paris Hilton, stay home.
1408300	1413720	Keep your skanky ass at home with your dumb little dog and get the hell away from my show.
1413720	1416960	To that I say, Amen.
1416960	1421680	I understand because there are a lot of people there and it's hard to conduct business, but
1421680	1429160	at the same time, it's good to have the publicity for your games, especially the smaller companies.
1429160	1434240	They want people noticing their game there because then it gets covered and then the
1434240	1435600	word spreads about it.
1435600	1441780	I think that there are the major news sites out there, but the smaller guys also get the
1441780	1442780	message out.
1442780	1445960	When you're reading it on some of the smaller sites, it's like, wow, this information might
1445960	1447880	be pretty big if it's being covered.
1447880	1452160	The smaller sites don't tend to just copy and paste the press release.
1452160	1456880	Not that I'm insinuating that the big boys do anything, but I overheard at a recent media
1456880	1459880	event, big boys saying that's essentially what they did is they copied and pasted from
1459880	1461280	the press release.
1461280	1464260	So if that's what you want, why bother throwing a show?
1464260	1465800	Just fucking email E3.
1465800	1469480	Just put E3 in a zip file and send it to their email.
1469480	1474520	Web conference, not in a conference room with those intercom things.
1474520	1475520	I don't know.
1475520	1476520	I'm just worried.
1476520	1478600	Personally, I'm worried we're not going to be invited.
1478600	1483440	That's my only worry and it would be very disappointing to me because I really do care
1483440	1488760	about seeing these companies' product and helping promote that stuff.
1488760	1493960	That's kind of why we go, but they don't think that just because...
1493960	1498040	I like how certain TV shows out there, even though they don't cover gaming anymore, still
1498040	1503520	get top listing on these new events.
1503520	1504520	I don't know.
1504520	1507400	I'm not trying to be focused on that.
1507400	1510520	If they don't want coverage, then we'll cover something else that wants the coverage that
1510520	1512640	I'm sure is a decent game, fine.
1512640	1515680	But I think it's interesting that the whole thing is being held in Santa Monica because
1515680	1520380	I think about, shit, we stayed in Santa Monica for the last E3 and had that horrible commute
1520380	1525120	to downtown LA that made us late for those shows we were doing for Marina.
1525120	1528960	That hotel we stayed at, the Best Western or whatever it was, probably going to be twice
1528960	1531880	as expensive next year now that E3 is there.
1531880	1536400	But I then think about, boy, Scott over at All Games and the folks at Arena Interactive
1536400	1537400	Lounge where we broadcast...
1537400	1538400	Snack dab in the middle of it.
1538400	1540720	They're probably having a fucking field day at this news.
1540720	1542440	They're probably so excited.
1542440	1547200	But I also think, and I'm not insinuating anything, I don't know shit about what they're
1547200	1551360	doing next year, but just knowing the type of guy that Scott is, he will try and get
1551360	1556680	some of those indie developers that get shut out of the big show over at the Arena.
1556680	1560000	My gut tells me based on some things I saw last year that probably I wouldn't put it
1560000	1565960	past those guys to try and do some type of unofficial E3 satellite thingy there and it's
1565960	1567720	going to be right in the heart of everything.
1567720	1571360	And I say, fine, we'll cover that if we can't get into the big show.
1571360	1575600	So I'm looking forward to it anyways.
1575600	1576720	Outpost is where it's at next year.
1576720	1580040	I miss my yearly playing of X-Tango.
1580040	1582200	Yeah, poor X-Tango.
1582200	1586920	Hey, yeah, Scott, if you're listening, get the X-Tango folks at Arena.
1586920	1589400	Tell them to give me a copy.
1589400	1591680	So we can ask them if their game's ever going to freaking come out.
1591680	1592680	That'd be nice.
1592680	1597480	It's going to be part of the brand new Duke Nukem Forever.
1597480	1600480	Coming out on the Phantom.
1600480	1609480	Anyway, speaking of games that we've been waiting for, the demo for Phantasy Star Universe
1609480	1613520	on Xbox 360 is out.
1613520	1618160	Today being Sunday for us, is the last day that you can download it.
1618160	1622800	I think it was down midnight on Saturday.
1622800	1628280	Well, whatever, by the time the people who download this show hear it, it's too late.
1628280	1633680	Well, at any rate, I haven't played mine yet.
1633680	1638560	I did download it yesterday, which is why I made my whole gamertag account and everything.
1638560	1644840	But it will be up for play until Wednesday midnight, so that's the only time you're going
1644840	1645840	to get to.
1645840	1649520	Of course, it's already been in Japan forever, and I already know someone who has it on PC.
1649520	1654560	But you know what's really pissy though about the Japanese release is that your CDs are
1654560	1662600	all coded much like the US ones were for the GameCube and Dreamcast.
1662600	1667120	But you also can only register online, and Sega got a whole crap load of complaints about
1667120	1672520	that from people who don't have internet service or dial up.
1672520	1674600	Or they just want to play the single player mode.
1674600	1678160	They bought it just for single player, but you cannot play unless you register, even
1678160	1679160	single player.
1679160	1680160	Ouch.
1680160	1688240	Well, as for the open beta, once the actual release is out, it will be $9.99 a month for
1688240	1689640	our European listeners.
1689640	1693920	That's 6.99 pounds.
1693920	1698880	And they're saying that it will be available for your license, or they're calling it guardian
1698880	1705960	license, will be available for purchase beginning the 24th of November on PC, PlayStation 2,
1705960	1706960	and Xbox 360.
1706960	1711680	Luckily, all the achievements are offline, so I can just rent this thing, which is excellent
1711680	1712680	horror.
1712680	1719120	And note the other best part about that beta demo is Tuesday that Xbox Live is going to
1719120	1723200	be down the whole day, so you actually only get about two days to play that.
1723200	1724200	Thank you, Sega.
1724200	1725200	Yeah, that's true.
1725200	1728440	Yeah, Xbox Live is going to be down Tuesday, so whoops, whoopsie daisy, forgot to plan
1728440	1729440	for that.
1729440	1730440	Oh well.
1730440	1737560	At any rate, it's already out on PC in Japan, and that hasn't stopped people.
1737560	1741920	My friend who's actually had this game now for about, I would say she's had about three
1741920	1746320	weeks to a month, right?
1746320	1751360	There is someone who is on one of the big Phantasy Star sites, again I'm not going to
1751360	1757640	list names publicly, has made a loading tool for this to bypass the online registration.
1757640	1761800	You cannot play it online, but you can play it in single player mode if you want to try
1761800	1764120	out the PC version.
1764120	1768800	Just look around, it's out there.
1768800	1773800	I actually got to play the PSU demo, or beta, whatever you want to call it.
1773800	1779180	The thing is though, it's kind of hard for me to base my judgment off of beta, because
1779180	1784080	even though the full game is out in ten days, you did download something that's usually
1784080	1786240	going to be on a DVD, whatever.
1786240	1791320	But also the thing is that this thing is getting flooded with people that are just like, OMG
1791320	1792920	free game.
1792920	1793920	That's the problem.
1793920	1797480	I can't wait for these people to be gone, and it's just the people who actually want
1797480	1802040	to be playing and paid good money for Phantasy Star Universe, and then they'll stop bogging
1802040	1805120	the servers, I think.
1805120	1811440	As for the game itself, what I did get to play, the only problem I had with it is the
1811440	1815720	tutorial was a little bit clunky and would freeze up, so it was easier to bypass it.
1815720	1819520	If you bypass the tutorial, then you kind of don't know what you're doing in the game,
1819520	1823200	because just enough has changed from Phantasy Star Online.
1823200	1827640	Finally, once I figured it out and got in there, it was kind of fun, and I played with
1827640	1832080	a stranger through one level, and it ran pretty well.
1832080	1835560	I've got to say, some of the sceneries are really nice.
1835560	1840600	If you figure out, for those that are playing the beta, go out to the fourth floor, go out
1840600	1845020	the left side, and then you can transport to different planets, and you can transport
1845020	1853240	to this greenish planet that has a very ancient China-looking city, and then if you go out
1853240	1857200	in the world there, even though the mission is a level 15 mission, just kind of go into
1857200	1858200	it and see what it looks like.
1858200	1859200	It's really pretty.
1859200	1861680	It looks like fall, and things are falling from the trees.
1861680	1863440	It's nice-looking.
1863440	1869680	I don't think it's OMG, next-gen, to-the-max nice-looking, but that makes sense, seeing
1869680	1873880	as it was developed for PlayStation 2 as well, but it's nice.
1873880	1879280	I probably will pick up the retail version, only because I know at least Miklotov will
1879280	1885760	play with me, and probably DarkSakura and our buddy Kasumi as well will all be playing.
1885760	1888640	So it'll be fun, because there will be people to play with.
1888640	1893360	The one thing that I sort of hope is that since we've done this massive download, it
1893360	1898160	would be nice, though, for the folks that actually have gone into the effort of downloading
1898160	1902060	the game, that we could just play off the downloaded version, but maybe there could
1902060	1905960	be a quick mode or something that they actually use the demo version for.
1905960	1906960	Oh, I see.
1906960	1909760	Well, they already said you're not going to be able to transfer your character you made
1909760	1911000	in the beta over, so...
1911000	1912000	That's ridiculous.
1912000	1913000	Yeah, well.
1913000	1914000	Miklotov, what do you think?
1914000	1915000	You've spent a lot of time playing this.
1915000	1917360	I really like it.
1917360	1922700	I have a few really glaring issues with it, though.
1922700	1926480	So I play as a force on Phantasy Star Online, because they're the best.
1926480	1931720	And in this game, from what I can tell so far is that the only way I can do magic is
1931720	1933080	if I equip it to a weapon.
1933080	1939680	So I'm going to have to carry multiple weapons, or maybe, I don't know, I'm talking as loud
1939680	1943000	as I can.
1943000	1947080	I have to equip multiple weapons so I can have different magic spells, and that's going
1947080	1949320	to really make me angry.
1949320	1956480	And I like that Sega's crazy word filtering stuff still happens.
1956480	1961240	Somebody had to use periods to cuss at me today, and it was pretty funny.
1961240	1963040	Why were they cussing at you?
1963040	1965640	Because they're like 12-year-olds that are playing Xbox Live.
1965640	1966640	OMG free game.
1966640	1968640	Yeah, exactly, like what you said earlier.
1968640	1970960	Have you made voice chat in that?
1970960	1971960	Voice chat?
1971960	1972960	I don't know.
1972960	1974640	I didn't party, because I don't want to play with other people right now.
1974640	1978960	I believe voice chat is only available once you get into a zone.
1978960	1982240	It's not like in the lobby, like it was in the first game.
1982240	1983360	I think it actually is.
1983360	1984360	It's in party.
1984360	1985360	Yeah.
1985360	1990000	So one thing, though, that for anybody who is playing on Sega's website, they do have
1990000	1992100	a feedback form.
1992100	1995200	They want feedback from the beta, apparently.
1995200	1999380	So make sure that if you see any glitches, anything weird, anything you don't like, make
1999380	2001600	sure that you post about it on their page.
2001600	2004120	Doesn't it seem like they're kind of a little close, though, with only 10 days to go?
2004120	2005120	I mean, is this going to be another 8 days?
2005120	2009680	If it's something that just requires a general tweak or a change in code, then...
2009680	2014120	But the game's got to have already been shipped to retailers, essentially, waiting to go out.
2014120	2017200	But I think it's talking about major glitches.
2017200	2022920	Yeah, I know, but here we go again, another Xbox 360 game where they're patching it on
2022920	2024320	the back end to fix all the bugs.
2024320	2025320	You know, I'm just kind of like...
2025320	2027920	That happens with any type of MMO.
2027920	2028920	I guess.
2028920	2032760	MMOs exist to be glitchy.
2032760	2037200	I just hope it doesn't stay, you know, rappy Christmas for five years like the old Xbox
2037200	2038200	one.
2038200	2044400	You know, it sucks that it is glitchy, but we shouldn't expect MMOs to be glitchy.
2044400	2047400	That's just fucking laziness in programming is what it is.
2047400	2052040	I mean, you should be doing extensive beta testing on it, especially since the game came
2052040	2053840	out already in Japan.
2053840	2057760	You've already got, you know, some beta testing right there, you know, whatever you want to
2057760	2058760	call it.
2058760	2063200	But I think it's really ridiculous just to say, oh, yeah, this is a beta test, and hopefully
2063200	2066120	everything goes well because we already done the game.
2066120	2070160	So if we find a bug, yeah, that fucking sucks.
2070160	2072160	Any other thoughts on PSU?
2072160	2075840	The only other thing I don't like about it, and I know I'm being negative about it, but
2075840	2078480	I do really like the game.
2078480	2083880	At least in PSO, you all kind of look the same, like, you know, all the forces had dresses
2083880	2085380	and such.
2085380	2095020	But their creation in this game, while it's highly detailed, the costumes, each, like,
2095020	2100140	the newmans and the humans for each gender, they all get the same costumes.
2100140	2104560	So you see a lot of the same people running around.
2104560	2108480	It's pretty terrible because, I mean, I don't want to see a whole bunch of people with just
2108480	2113800	the black and red shirt on, and it doesn't seem like anybody's really, you know, their
2113800	2115480	own character because of it.
2115480	2120400	I do understand that the RBG slider has been removed to change color.
2120400	2121400	Oh, really?
2121400	2122960	I didn't know it was there in, like, the...
2122960	2123960	It was in the old ones.
2123960	2125680	You could change the colors of the outfits.
2125680	2128960	Oh, no, it was...
2128960	2130920	The hair and different tones.
2130920	2131920	You can do it for some of it.
2131920	2135320	Oh, you can still do the hairs and, like, the eyes and stuff, which is really cool because
2135320	2138680	you can do eyes before, it's just depending on your face.
2138680	2144920	But I mean, at least there were, like, different patterns on the different outfits you could
2144920	2150960	pick in PSO, but now it's just palette swaps, and they look pretty terrible.
2150960	2154680	You know, since Miklotov likes to play a force, essentially what he's saying is he misses
2154680	2157600	being able to wear a dress in Phantasy Star Online.
2157600	2159600	Yeah, actually, I kind of do it.
2159600	2163080	It doesn't look like a force if I'm wearing shorts and a short-sleeve shirt.
2163080	2164080	I'm sorry.
2164080	2169240	Dude, the forces were great because the men had these evening gowns, and...
2169240	2173760	Well, what I'm thinking is they probably removed some of the stuff for the beta.
2173760	2176520	I mean, because it's, you know, they cut down the file size.
2176520	2179640	I think it's actually like that on the PC version.
2179640	2183840	I'll have to, I actually have to ask my friend who's been playing it.
2183840	2186200	Oh, hopefully they'll release more later.
2186200	2187200	I don't know.
2187200	2191520	There's supposed to be downloadable patches later for extra outfits and things you can
2191520	2193080	earn, stuff like that.
2193080	2194080	All right.
2194080	2197720	Well, we'll have a more full review of the actual game itself once it's released.
2197720	2200640	I'm sure at least one of us, if not two or three of us, are going to pick that thing
2200640	2202960	up, so we'll give you our full thoughts on the game a little later.
2202960	2205400	In the meantime, if you haven't downloaded the beta yet, too bad.
2205400	2207880	You're not going to get a chance.
2207880	2212960	Moving on to another Xbox-related story, Microsoft is teaming up with Best Buy and the Boys and
2212960	2216000	Girls Club of America to go on a 20-city bus tour.
2216000	2222000	They're going to be educating parents on the ESRB rating scheme and how to implement parental
2222000	2225320	controls on the Xbox 360 and the Xbox Live service.
2225320	2231280	In other words, hopefully there'll be a tutorial on how to block asses on the Xbox 360 cams
2231280	2233640	for parents.
2233640	2240040	This is a nice, good service, feel-good community thing, but it certainly doesn't help in selling
2240040	2242120	parents on Xbox 360s, does it?
2242120	2243120	I'm sorry?
2243120	2246120	I think it does.
2246120	2247120	What do you mean?
2247120	2248120	Oh, no, no.
2248120	2249120	I'm being a little bit sarcastic.
2249120	2250120	Oh, sorry.
2250120	2251120	I'm stupid.
2251120	2255560	I'm telling parents on the Xbox 360, like, look at what a great, family-friendly system
2255560	2256560	we are.
2256560	2260000	Nintendo, eat your heart out, you know, type thing, even though, you know, I'm again being
2260000	2263720	sarcastic because obviously Nintendo and Sony both will have very similar things built in
2263720	2264720	their systems.
2264720	2269720	Anyway, the tour is going to be going around pretty much the top cities in the U.S. where
2269720	2276200	the most people are, you know, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco,
2276200	2277200	Seattle.
2277200	2281600	If you want to check out the full schedule, you can always check out xbox.com slash is
2281600	2284440	your family set.
2284440	2286720	Is your family set, Loki?
2286720	2289520	I would hope so because I don't have a family.
2289520	2292840	I'm set, so, you know, whatever.
2292840	2298120	I'm set and ready to see some Xbox cam boobies and cocks.
2298120	2299880	Let's make sure you're 18 and over, please.
2299880	2302160	I have the internet for boobs.
2302160	2306200	Well, I haven't seen any of that stuff yet, but yeah, that'd be kind of fun.
2306200	2307200	No, neither have I. I'm just kidding.
2307200	2308200	I don't really want to see it.
2308200	2310840	They should have a channel that's only that stuff.
2310840	2311840	Like the underground?
2311840	2316360	Like, yeah, something like the red light district or something.
2316360	2317760	Yeah, you do get to classify yourself.
2317760	2319480	It's called the green door.
2319480	2323080	You get to classify yourself, you know, under Xbox, like, oh, you're recreational, you're
2323080	2325040	pro or you're underground, right?
2325040	2326560	They do need red light district.
2326560	2332520	But I have never seen those categories actually dictate where you actually get placed.
2332520	2333520	Oh, I have.
2333520	2334520	Have you?
2334520	2339040	Yeah, for ChromeHounds, actually, when you're inviting people, you can make it specific
2339040	2340040	to certain...
2340040	2341040	Oh, whatever.
2341040	2342040	All right.
2342040	2343040	Whatever.
2343040	2345560	Well, it's pretty cool that they're, you know, kind of given some guidance to parents as
2345560	2349160	far as, you know, helping their kids with games and stuff.
2349160	2353160	Although some people, though, should have been receiving better guidance when they dropped
2353160	2357160	out of high school to play professional video games.
2357160	2363280	One such person, Tom Taylor, T-squared for short, is actually some 20-something year
2363280	2372520	old professional gamer who has landed a $250,000 gaming contract in addition to running his
2372520	2375880	brand new video game tutoring company.
2375880	2383640	And basically the Associated Press spoke with him about his, you know, earning six figures.
2383640	2388600	And basically his response to the whole thing was, he takes risks.
2388600	2389600	I take risks.
2389600	2392320	In order to get paid, you have to take risks.
2392320	2397560	I think I took the biggest risk I could take dropping out of school to play video games
2397560	2398800	and it paid off.
2398800	2402620	I guess some people are just born with talent in certain things like Michael Jordan was
2402620	2404200	born to play basketball.
2404200	2407040	I feel I was born to play video games.
2407040	2410700	Yeah, that's a really great role model.
2410700	2414680	Drop out of school so you can play video games professionally.
2414680	2420100	I don't want to see this guy be, yeah, I suggest all the gaming companies out there pick up
2420100	2421640	this guy as your spokesperson.
2421640	2422640	That's perfect.
2422640	2426420	That is the, you know, perfect role model you want for your customers.
2426420	2430840	Drop out of school because, you know what, you could buy some games on a minimum wage
2430840	2431840	job.
2431840	2432840	It's fine.
2432840	2435080	I want them to hire me.
2435080	2436880	I finished school.
2436880	2438880	I'm an educated gamer.
2438880	2444120	I want to tear into this guy but I can't help but think that would be a little bit hypocritical
2444120	2451720	when I think back to college and all the class I missed due to Final Fantasy VII.
2451720	2452720	But you know.
2452720	2455080	I used to skip class to watch Sailor Moon.
2455080	2459200	I think there's nothing wrong in the fact that, you know, playing video games for a
2459200	2463080	college, I mean granted that's pretty risky, I mean because, and let's not even get into
2463080	2467000	how ridiculous it is to pay people to play video games professionally, I mean that is
2467000	2469240	just ridiculous right there.
2469240	2472800	And I agree it's ridiculous with professional sports and all that stuff too, but whatever,
2472800	2473800	okay.
2473800	2479520	I don't say video games, video games is definitely not a sport, let me put it that way.
2479520	2480520	Just like curling.
2480520	2484040	I think there's a difference too between high school drop out and college drop out.
2484040	2485240	College drop out, that's fine.
2485240	2489140	In this society there's an expectation, you know, well certainly, I mean again I guess
2489140	2493580	it depends on which part of the country you're in, but you know, there's a real pressure
2493580	2498440	out there to really, you've got to graduate high school if you want to move up in the
2498440	2499440	corporate world.
2499440	2503800	I mean granted there are jobs available and I don't know, because it's like there's exceptions
2503800	2507960	to every world, but I just feel like, you know, if you're going to drop out of high
2507960	2511800	school for a family situation, that's one thing, but you're going to drop out of high
2511800	2516280	school to play video games, I don't know.
2516280	2521120	And you know, from what I hear too, his team isn't that great.
2521120	2523840	So I mean, I don't know.
2523840	2526880	Interesting comments in our chat room though over at orangelawntrader.com, click on chat.
2526880	2530620	Black Boy says, wait, how many pop stars never went to college?
2530620	2531960	Or maybe pop stars dropped out of high school.
2531960	2535180	I have no problem with people not going to college, because you know what, personally
2535180	2539280	I didn't go to college and I don't think I really missed anything, because there aren't
2539280	2542800	actually a lot of people that will start up, you know, their own businesses and stuff and
2542800	2544840	they're very successful without going to college.
2544840	2549600	I mean, granted, colleges help with certain jobs and stuff like that, but it's not necessary
2549600	2552680	if you've already got the smarts to kind of do it, you can pretty much, you know, start
2552680	2554440	up a company and be successful without it.
2554440	2558700	I dropped out of college, I'm not exactly proud of it, but at the time it's what I had
2558700	2560200	to do and I don't regret it.
2560200	2566440	I've actually been in college off and on now for about 10 years.
2566440	2568460	But see though, high school is important.
2568460	2572800	I think you should be finishing high school, I mean, because, or at least test out of it.
2572800	2573800	Yeah, exactly.
2573800	2576120	You should be doing better education in high school though.
2576120	2582000	Or, okay, I mean, I don't know, I just have a really big problem with someone like this
2582000	2587400	being kind of a sponsor, because all we need this guy is to actually start playing good
2587400	2593500	and winning stuff and then have him doing reviews on games and stuff, yeah, I got really
2593500	2596960	good by not going to high school, yeah, that's excellent.
2596960	2599680	In other words, kids, be cool, stay in school.
2599680	2600680	Exactly.
2600680	2604680	Any other comments from our chat room here, Funny Dale says, this guy is going to be working
2604680	2608520	at Burger King in five years cleaning out the fat fryer.
2608520	2612800	Hit Stun says, I can see him getting a right thumb injury and being out for a season and
2612800	2613800	going broke.
2613800	2621280	So, that's true, what do you have to fall back on if you get carpal tunnel?
2621280	2622280	You're screwed young man.
2622280	2626040	I have to have that Atari controller that used your eyebrows.
2626040	2630840	Or hopefully in the future we'll be controlling games with our brains.
2630840	2637080	Well, speaking of brains and certain people who remain unnamed on this radio show, not
2637080	2644220	using them, sorry, well, we've all been paying attention to the fact that Bully was pulled
2644220	2648760	into court for being, you know, violent game, oh my God.
2648760	2651840	I have a new name for said dummy.
2651840	2654640	How about Crack Frompson?
2654640	2659240	I still like Jackie Poo or Jackass.
2659240	2667800	At any rate, the verdict that went down though with the ruling is basically the judge is
2667800	2671080	not going to prohibit the sale of Bully.
2671080	2674520	To quote, in the time that he played the game, the judge said he did not see anything so
2674520	2678640	violent that would require the game to be held from being shipped.
2678640	2682920	The judge and Take-Two employee used a cheat code in order to skip around in the game.
2682920	2688640	From what I understand, I think they played through the game for at least two hours, and
2688640	2691120	that's plenty of time to get a good feel for the game.
2691120	2697800	They're also saying that there wasn't anything different than what was seen on TV really.
2697800	2702640	OMG, there's cheat codes to skip around in the game, excellent.
2702640	2708600	But if anyone's curious about how everybody's not friend, the real bully of the industry
2708600	2713000	reacted, he was told to sit down.
2713000	2716240	Wasn't there like outbursts in the courtroom in that whole thing?
2716240	2718240	Oh, I would have loved to have been there.
2718240	2724640	The thing is that he had no business being there because you cannot work, I think, as
2724640	2728960	legal advisor for something that you have an interest in.
2728960	2732320	He did mention though that he hoped that people got injured after playing this game so he
2732320	2733520	could go, I told you so.
2733520	2737960	Didn't he like sneak a slingshot into the courtroom to make some type of point about
2737960	2739680	this is what people are going to do?
2739680	2744280	Okay, okay, I know we're not really supposed to talk about it.
2744280	2745840	What about Simpsons?
2745840	2750480	Bart has a slingshot, I don't see slingshot-related deaths in the news.
2750480	2752720	He's an idiot, plain and simple.
2752720	2759640	The man has no comp, you can be educated and still be stupid, and this man is living proof.
2759640	2760920	I cannot wait.
2760920	2765400	And actually the thing about him being involved in this case is actually, from what I understand,
2765400	2768800	precedent to have him disbarred in that state, so let's hope it happens.
2768800	2772100	Raven's Dolphin says, Dennis the Menace has a slingshot.
2772100	2775400	Go back to like 50s homely- 40s, I think.
2775400	2776400	Was it?
2776400	2777400	40s, yeah.
2777400	2781780	I know, they were on Nickelodeon when I was a kid, so.
2781780	2788320	It's human nature, I'm trying to remember which philosopher said this, but the nature
2788320	2792680	of man is nasty, brutish, and short.
2792680	2796560	People are prone to violence, it's written into our freaking DNA.
2796560	2800760	No one talks about the dangers of cup stacking, either.
2800760	2804600	Really Jack Thompson should- oh, I said it.
2804600	2808280	Now I gotta go kill myself, that's alright.
2808280	2813960	Him should actually go after them, because cup stacking is very dangerous, I think.
2813960	2815920	Someone could put in an eye with that stuff.
2815920	2819560	Why can't he just go back to attacking the music industry, please?
2819560	2823880	My whole thing is, if they had pulled this game from Wal-Mart, or whatever, he got the
2823880	2831080	result he wanted, doesn't that set the precedent that Wal-Mart ought to be pulling copies of
2831080	2837960	Kill Bill off the shelves, and Pulp Fiction, and other violent train spotting, and other
2837960	2839400	really violent movies?
2839400	2841960	It's a double standard.
2841960	2844240	Of course, maybe Jack Thompson would like that, I don't know.
2844240	2846820	I said it too, spank, spank, spank.
2846820	2850280	Maybe they should change it to Bible Mart.
2850280	2854160	It's still a very nasty double standard that we're seeing in the overall entertainment
2854160	2855720	industry.
2855720	2858560	Right now, video games is the current scapegoat.
2858560	2859560	That's how it is.
2859560	2867960	It was music in the 80s and early 90s, it's evolved on to- back in the days, it was, you
2867960	2872160	know, we can't watch this TV show because it's so risque, and they attack in the morning-
2872160	2875560	Oh my god, Mr. and Mrs. Brady share a bed, who knew?
2875560	2880400	Oh my god, Elvis and his hip thrusting, who knew?
2880400	2885440	Or people would go on, what was that example, on the Ed Sullivan Show and ask them to change
2885440	2886440	lyrics.
2886440	2888840	Women are going to look at that and get impregnated immediately.
2888840	2896920	Or even now with the whole not having available women's health care because we're going to
2896920	2900680	decide to take over the world and fuck everybody, I don't know.
2900680	2905680	Flaming Bozo in our chat room says, why doesn't he go to porn, why doesn't he fight porn?
2905680	2909160	But at the same time, they don't sell porn at Wal-Mart, although I, well, I don't know.
2909160	2910960	Everybody knows Jackie Pooh shops at Wal-Mart.
2910960	2914520	I'm sure they sell Skinamax type movies there, but anyway.
2914520	2921040	We all know that the whole reason he's so retentive is just that he's just not getting
2921040	2922040	laid.
2922040	2923040	Wow.
2923040	2924040	That's it.
2924040	2928120	All right, well, you know- There's no one would.
2928120	2935040	Things about our dear friend, Mr. Frompson, get us a little bit angry.
2935040	2938520	I don't know about you, Dark Sakura, but I just, I get so frustrated whenever I read
2938520	2943640	about what this clown's up to next, and it makes me just want to rant a little bit.
2943640	2945440	Doesn't it make you want to rant a little bit?
2945440	2946440	A little.
2946440	2950480	So I think it's time to bring on the trumpets and the symphonies that declare it be the
2950480	2962800	FUs of the week.
2962800	2970240	My FU of the week goes towards the stupid evil sinus infection from hell.
2970240	2976240	For anyone who wasn't listening last year, I was sick for about two months with a weird
2976240	2983400	combination of bronchitis and pneumonia, because, um, as the sinus infection, um, well, I have
2983400	2987280	a sinus infection again, and it's starting off exactly the same way that my last one
2987280	2992080	did, so now they're pumping me full of antibiotics and all kinds of anti-allergy drugs and all
2992080	2993080	kinds of crap.
2993080	2999080	It makes me feel absolutely loony and also lose my voice, like, I wake up in the morning
2999080	3000080	and have no voice.
3000080	3001080	It's crazy.
3001080	3004440	And I love to talk, I guess, and so, you know, I'm on a radio show and all that.
3004440	3007160	And I'm not always sick.
3007160	3015600	FU to Fireboma, too, but, um, FU to the sinus infection, and also, the advice nurse was
3015600	3021320	so funny, she's like, now, you've got chronic fatigue syndrome, it says here on your things,
3021320	3023240	you're gonna get really tired.
3023240	3027520	No shit, lady!
3027520	3033360	But to, to, to their credit, the Kaiser folks were really nice to me and gave me my choice
3033360	3038800	of antibiotics, so, yeah, I hate it.
3038800	3041160	You sound like I've been drinking whiskey all night.
3041160	3046040	I always thought that chronic fatigue syndrome was an inclination to wearing camo, but, you
3046040	3047200	know, I guess I'm wrong.
3047200	3052440	No, chronic fatigue syndrome is wearing camo and, you know, smoking the chronic.
3052440	3053440	Gotcha.
3053440	3060560	Anyways, um, FU to the India casino that we went to last night, because, um, you know,
3060560	3064800	I think most Indian, actually, this Indian casino seems to be the worst one, it's Thunder
3064800	3070800	Valley over here, um, I believe it's in Rockland or something, whatever, in California, and,
3070800	3077800	um, basically, they want to rape you for your money, kind of like, um, yeah, like America
3077800	3079720	did to the Indians way back when.
3079720	3084440	But, um, anyways, um, I did leave there, though, only losing 50 cents, so that, that's really
3084440	3085440	good.
3085440	3092960	Oh, and, by the way, for Rob, FU, the fact that they do not have coconut shrimp.
3092960	3099200	Um, my FU of the week goes to commuting.
3099200	3101920	I'm giving the FU to driving this week, who would have thought?
3101920	3107160	No, my FU goes to commuting and long commutes, and they make me frumpy and sad.
3107160	3108160	That's it.
3108160	3117320	My FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making a crappy Xbox A60 controller and ruining a
3117320	3124000	brilliant game like Lumines, because you guys can't make a D-pad.
3124000	3126600	And that's going to do it for, uh, this week's dose of Angst.
3126600	3130720	At least it's better than the PSP D-pad.
3130720	3135680	I like the PSP's D-pad, it's just the analog stick, they're the nub, the nipple, that bugs
3135680	3136680	me.
3136680	3140760	When I play Lumines on PSP, I have to use the analog stick on the 360, and I'll tell
3140760	3143560	you, that's not really fun at all.
3143560	3150500	All right, well, speaking of Sony controllers, there's a new one coming out for the PlayStation
3150500	3154600	3, which was shown at Digital Life, which happened in New York City this weekend.
3154600	3157600	I'm sure some of our listeners, I know some of them were there, I'm sure we'll get some
3157600	3161980	calls in the Skyline a little later from the show from our folks who are at Digital Life.
3161980	3166640	But there were some awards handed out at Digital Life, and I'm, I'm assuming this was Digital
3166640	3171960	Life and Ziff Davis that handed out these awards, have no idea how they picked them,
3171960	3176360	but the reason why I say PlayStation 3 is that Sony PlayStation 3 won the award for
3176360	3178100	Best of Show.
3178100	3180760	So it seems like things might be on a little bit of a turnaround.
3180760	3183360	Even better people own some heavy narcotics.
3183360	3189480	Or somebody's on some payroll, I don't know, but Ziff Davis, they don't have a PlayStation
3189480	3190480	magazine, do they?
3190480	3191480	Oh, wait, they do!
3191480	3195880	Okay, but to be fair, they have one for Xbox 360 as well, right?
3195880	3197600	No, they have computer and video games.
3197600	3198600	Whatever.
3198600	3199600	I don't give a shit, okay?
3199600	3204800	The point is, is that, you know, they got this award or whatever, so it seems like in
3204800	3209880	some folks' mind, maybe things are coming around for Sony, and maybe now Sony is starting
3209880	3212680	to put out the, it's hard for me to say.
3212680	3216680	I didn't play PlayStation 3 at Digital Life, I'm going to be relying on the listeners who
3216680	3221820	call in later in the show to tell us how, if the PlayStation 3 at Digital Life was deserving
3221820	3222820	of this award.
3222820	3224420	I can just see it now.
3224420	3226360	You know why the PlayStation 3 is awesome?
3226360	3230440	Because it smells like money!
3230440	3231820	Somehow I doubt that's it.
3231820	3234360	What if they had really good games on display there?
3234360	3236400	Loki, you don't know, you weren't there.
3236400	3240640	Yeah, but I saw the list of games, and probably not.
3240640	3242600	Whatever, you know, hey, great.
3242600	3247680	Someone wants to spend $600 for the system, more power to you, go pre-order it at EB.
3247680	3250160	Oh, wait, can't do that.
3250160	3255440	SSJ100Matt says, Sky, they gave out Japanese horrors and HDTVs.
3255440	3260740	DJKipplesandbit says, I went to Digital Life, I have no idea how the PS3 won during that
3260740	3261740	show.
3261740	3271560	Let's see, Jaded2006 says, just keep thinking that Sony is going to make a turnaround.
3271560	3272560	Very interesting.
3272560	3278440	Also, some other awards won at the show, Gaming Hardware, PlayStation 3.
3278440	3282600	Gaming Software, Final Fantasy XII.
3282600	3287240	For those of you that have to shop for kids this holiday season, the best gift for kids
3287240	3289320	was the Fisher-Price SparkArt Easel.
3289320	3290680	Is that like a Light Bright?
3290680	3291680	I don't know.
3291680	3293140	I'm Miss Light Bright.
3293140	3299240	Best booth also went to Sony, but the hippest booth went to Napster.
3299240	3300240	Remember them?
3300240	3301240	Remember Napster?
3301240	3302240	They're still around.
3302240	3303240	Hey kids, remember Napster?
3303240	3307540	There had to have been recreational pharmaceuticals involved in that show.
3307540	3309680	I can neither confirm nor deny those statements again.
3309680	3311320	We'll hear from the listeners a little later in the show.
3311320	3317000	I'm sure they're already trying to hammer the Skype line to get in, so we'll see.
3317000	3319280	And SSJ100Matt is putting out a call.
3319280	3321280	Where's our listener, GrayWolf?
3321280	3326480	He's the guy in the forums that's unapologetic in his Sony Phantom, wishing he was here right
3326480	3327480	now.
3327480	3328480	Who apparently writes in poetic prose form.
3328480	3329640	Hey, they're fun to read.
3329640	3330760	You know what?
3330760	3334280	I encourage the opposing viewpoint to the masses.
3334280	3337960	I encourage the opposing viewpoint as long as it's educated.
3337960	3343360	And I'm all for a little bit of friendly debate as long as it doesn't resort to name calling.
3343360	3350600	Well, Sony is apparently pretty happy after this week's pre-order fest at GameStop and
3350600	3351600	EB.
3351600	3356640	Of course, in case you didn't hear, they sold out of all the systems that the stores
3356640	3357640	got.
3357640	3360760	Well, it's not hard to sell out when you're only reserving eight systems at a store.
3360760	3366520	I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, now now eight was, you know, a larger number.
3366520	3368240	Some stores only got like four, I think.
3368240	3369680	Some had sixteen, to be fair.
3369680	3370680	But, still.
3370680	3371680	Eight to sixteen, whatever.
3371680	3375840	Anyway, so that's somewhere between twenty, oh, almost about twenty-eight thousand to
3375840	3378080	about fifty-eight thousand systems.
3378080	3379880	It's not bad.
3379880	3385080	Basically, according to the Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson, Dave
3385080	3386080	Cracker.
3386080	3388760	Yeah, that's Cracker, all right.
3388760	3389760	His name's Cracker?
3389760	3392560	Well, Cracker or Craker or whatever.
3392560	3394720	Listen up, Cracker!
3394720	3395720	Anyways.
3395720	3397680	Sorry, I had to be said.
3397680	3400440	It was within minutes because, you know, obviously they sold out.
3400440	3403120	Oh, yeah, because you had the line going, so.
3403120	3408680	It reconfirms the excitement and anticipation that we've known since the very first discussion
3408680	3410200	of PlayStation 3.
3410200	3414780	We're just pleased to see that the reaction from the consumer is as strong as we anticipated
3414780	3415860	it would be.
3415860	3419200	It helps validate everything that we've been seeing up to this point.
3419200	3423240	So if I released a system with only one unit in the United States, it'd be like, we sold
3423240	3426960	everything in one second.
3426960	3428040	It's awesome.
3428040	3434600	My rebuttal to Sony is, everyone just go read VG Cats, look at the last comic, it perfectly
3434600	3435880	illustrates it.
3435880	3440160	And you know what, I'm sure we'll be covering this a little bit later on, but I don't think
3440160	3443280	a lot of those people were keeping those systems.
3443280	3448400	It's more like, hey, you know what, the Xbox 360 was being able to be sold for twice retail
3448400	3449400	on eBay.
3449400	3450400	Hmm.
3450400	3454200	I'll tell you what, because I've got a PlayStation 3 pre-ordered.
3454200	3455840	I know, traitor.
3455840	3456840	My husband ordered.
3456840	3458440	No, you're just a gaming whore.
3458440	3462200	No, he ordered one and didn't pre-order a Wii and I'm pissed off at him.
3462200	3464000	Yeah, F you.
3464000	3465000	Anyway.
3465000	3469840	But the thing is, is that, you know, like if we decide that we hate it, which I probably
3469840	3473720	will, except I want to play White Nights, but I could just autograph it and put it on
3473720	3478760	eBay for a million, then, you know, I'd pay for the rest of my college and set up my own
3478760	3480840	business and that type of thing.
3480840	3481840	I guess.
3481840	3482840	I don't know.
3482840	3484320	The Dark Soccer Autographed Edition PS3.
3484320	3491200	Well, also, I mean, of course, the Wii did also sell out as well at GameStop and EB,
3491200	3496560	and I believe each store is getting at least 32, well, they're getting upwards to 32 systems,
3496560	3500960	so about, I think it ended up being about twice what they were getting with the PlayStation
3500960	3501960	3.
3501960	3505360	I think the pro Sony side of this a little bit, you know, there are, I would believe
3505360	3510680	there are 50,000 people in this country that excited about the PlayStation 3.
3510680	3514760	I mean, for tech junkies, it is a Blu-ray player.
3514760	3515760	It's pretty cheap.
3515760	3517520	That's pretty exciting.
3517520	3520080	Maybe there's, you know, I would believe that there's that many fanboys.
3520080	3524480	I don't think there's any, it's just, you know, it's hard to go, ooh, it's just, it's
3524480	3530800	this ravaging success when you consider there's really only eight PlayStation 3s at the store
3530800	3532240	to be preserved, I don't know.
3532240	3536240	We'll see a little more towards November 17th, but then again, like I've always been saying,
3536240	3539000	is launch really that important?
3539000	3542680	PlayStation 2 didn't wow me at launch, but it really won me over about a year later.
3542680	3544080	Well, I don't know.
3544080	3547240	Maybe by a year later, they will have actual systems in the stores.
3547240	3548240	All right.
3548240	3550800	I want to ask, let me go talk really quick while he's still here, because he's going
3550800	3551800	to be leaving in a little bit.
3551800	3555360	I wanted to ask you, you actually camped out for the Wii pre-order, right?
3555360	3556360	I totally did.
3556360	3557360	Tell us about that experience.
3557360	3558360	How did that go?
3558360	3559360	What time did you get there?
3559360	3560360	Who else was there?
3560360	3563740	My roommate decided we were going to go do the Wii pre-order, because we really, really
3563740	3565120	want that system after playing it.
3565120	3568920	Because unlike some folks, I actually have to report to work at eight o'clock in the
3568920	3569920	morning.
3569920	3570920	Yeah, whatever.
3570920	3573280	I can go whenever I want.
3573280	3581960	And so we got up about 3.45 AM to go to our local GameStop, and he went a little bit earlier
3581960	3587600	than I did, but I arrived about a little past five, and there were already 16 people ahead
3587600	3594920	of me, which was insane to me, because I didn't think people were as stupid as I am.
3594920	3596920	Then again, this is the Bay Area.
3596920	3597920	This is Tech Home.
3597920	3598920	Yeah, that's true.
3598920	3605520	But I live in the sunset, which is dead, so it was still shocking to me.
3605520	3611520	And then more people started showing up, and around, I would say about maybe six, we had
3611520	3614840	a good 30 people in line to help pass the time.
3614840	3617840	I played clubhouse games, which is OK.
3617840	3622520	And then I'd say about 9.30, we had a little over 70 people in line.
3622520	3624740	What's great about that is that the store opens at 10.
3624740	3631920	So at about 9.30, 9.40, an employee came out, and those people who had been there since,
3631920	3636440	I would say about seven or eight, the people that were towards the back, they got told
3636440	3642000	that they would not be pre-ordering any systems today, because they only got 32 in.
3642000	3646040	So I thought it was kind of jerky that the employees waited that long to come out and
3646040	3649440	tell the people in the back of the line that they weren't going to get anything.
3649440	3651960	To their credit, though, corporate probably didn't tell them until then.
3651960	3654560	They probably didn't get an email until overnight or something.
3654560	3655600	That's not true.
3655600	3656600	That's not true.
3656600	3657600	Yeah.
3657600	3658600	They knew a few days in advance.
3658600	3659600	Yeah.
3659600	3660600	I knew about them.
3660600	3661600	Poopy!
3661600	3662600	They're just jerks.
3662600	3667080	But anyway, so they let us in two at a time to pre-order our systems, and I mean, it went
3667080	3668080	pretty smooth.
3668080	3672040	We got a list of stuff we could pre-order with the system while we were standing in
3672040	3676160	line, put the $50 down, and then we were on our way.
3676160	3682280	It was really nicely handled, except for that whole not coming out until 9.30 to tell the
3682280	3686480	people in the back of the line, because, I mean, you've got 40 people in line that aren't
3686480	3691640	getting systems, and we saw the employees get there about 9 and 8.30, so these people
3691640	3695400	are just waiting there, waiting for somebody to tell them that they have to go home.
3695400	3697180	What types of people did you see in line?
3697180	3700080	Was it all gaming nerds like you, or did you have the older parents?
3700080	3701240	I'm not a gaming nerd.
3701240	3703160	You are, but that's beside the point.
3703160	3705720	Were there any older people in the line?
3705720	3708720	Were there excited girls from college?
3708720	3717440	I saw maybe three girls, and then the front of the line comprised of scrawny white guys
3717440	3726020	and Asian guys, and then the back of the line were the older parents that maybe didn't realize
3726020	3732520	that they'd have to get there really early to get the systems preordered, so it was a
3732520	3733520	nice mix.
3733520	3737840	I'm just asking that because I'm curious, because Nintendo is trying to reach everybody,
3737840	3738840	but is it still the...
3738840	3743880	They're not going to reach everybody with a preorder that won't last longer than 10
3743880	3744880	minutes.
3744880	3750160	I still don't think that preordering the Wii is all that big of a deal, just because Nintendo
3750160	3754120	loves us, and you know they're making lots of them.
3754120	3761360	I just wanted the security, plus I kind of plan on maybe camping for the PS3, so I didn't
3761360	3770800	want to try to get to a nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd eBay, eBay, eBay.
3770800	3771800	And that's that.
3771800	3772800	All right.
3772800	3773800	Well, thanks for sharing your story.
3773800	3774800	We appreciate it.
3774800	3775800	That was very nice of you.
3775800	3777080	All right.
3777080	3781280	How about some more... Anything else you want to say on PS3 preorders?
3781280	3782280	Okay.
3782280	3789840	Well, I mean, there are going to be more preorders, I'm sure, around the world and stuff.
3789840	3795680	The whole thing is it's going to be very hard to come by, just very, very hard, so if you
3795680	3801560	are looking to get one, try to get it as soon as possible, because it is going to be like
3801560	3806000	the Xbox 360 was last year, and you might end up having to buy it on eBay if you really
3806000	3808280	want it or at day one.
3808280	3812960	And to be honest, I mean, I would wait, I mean, if it were me, I would wait just because
3812960	3817560	a lot of the launch games you may be looking forward to are delayed until next year, so
3817560	3823160	just kind of keep that in mind when you're thinking about preordering it.
3823160	3824680	All right.
3824680	3827560	Let's go on to some more gaming news.
3827560	3834960	Well, speaking of, back to the whole Sony camp, there is actually one thing that I am
3834960	3840120	personally excited about coming out on PSP, and that's After Burner.
3840120	3846520	Sega did confirm they have a deal with Planet Moon Studios to do a PSP version, a new one
3846520	3853640	of After Burner, so if anyone who was into the original, hey, and there's a quote actually
3853640	3860860	from the CEO of Planet Moon, most importantly, it's approximately 9,000% more portable than
3860860	3862740	the original arcade cabinet.
3862740	3868500	That just struck me as a stupid quote, but anyway, it's going to be called After Burner
3868500	3870120	Black Falcon.
3870120	3876920	It will have 19 officially licensed customizable planes, a single player modem, and Wi-Fi multiplayer,
3876920	3881040	and they're slated for spring 2007.
3881040	3884960	And I'd like to mention we also mentioned that back on episode 200.
3884960	3888960	That was also one of the big stories we came out with, so I see one of those under the
3888960	3889960	radar things.
3889960	3890960	Yes.
3890960	3894240	Well, it's been confirmed, you're not a liar, Loki.
3894240	3895240	Way to go.
3895240	3896240	I know.
3896240	3900520	Full auto 2 on PSP, March 14th, 2007, heard it here first.
3900520	3905280	Now if that's the one that doesn't happen, I'm going to laugh my ass off just to share.
3905280	3906280	Okay.
3906280	3911800	Speaking of Sony things, Eurogamer got a really in-depth look at PlayStation 3, the interface
3911800	3912800	and the online.
3912800	3913800	Check it out.
3913800	3916400	They got a pretty in-depth article over at Eurogamer.net.
3916400	3920000	Some of the highlights from their tour, of course, the PlayStation 3 is going to be using
3920000	3922280	what's called the cross media bar.
3922280	3925840	So if you've played the PSP at all, you're already familiar with how the PS3 is going
3925840	3931600	to be set up, which is kind of interesting that they have that very similar layout between
3931600	3932600	the two.
3932600	3934720	It kind of makes me wonder if the Wii and DS are going to be similar like that too.
3934720	3935880	I don't know.
3935880	3940080	They talk about how you're going to have web browsing on the PlayStation 3, something that
3940080	3942000	the Xbox 360 does not have currently.
3942000	3946560	Hopefully it will have better flash support and streaming media support.
3946560	3947560	Hopefully.
3947560	3948560	We'll see.
3948560	3951920	Yes, sir, I would imagine it can run this stuff.
3951920	3954860	There's the friends bar and there's different icons there.
3954860	3958120	Your signed in friends show their own icons on the bar there.
3958120	3963280	And then other icons would be those that are managing the PlayStation network account.
3963280	3966560	There's a master account and associated accounts.
3966560	3969040	So I'm assuming that's for like a family set up there.
3969040	3972920	So you could also like with the master account limit what your kids do on their accounts
3972920	3977560	and how much they can spend on the PlayStation store, which is another section of the bar.
3977560	3982000	And of course we all know SingStar is going to be huge on the PlayStation store right
3982000	3983140	out the gate.
3983140	3987920	So if you want to check out more on the tour of online and what to expect there, check
3987920	3988920	it out at Eurogamer.net.
3988920	3993200	And you know what's funny is the Sony store that they're going to have on there, no point
3993200	3997200	system like the Microsoft and Nintendo teams are doing.
3997200	4000780	It's just going to be dollars or your currency.
4000780	4004120	So that's kind of interesting I thought, I don't know.
4004120	4006880	But there's a comment from Mike in the chat room.
4006880	4009240	Loki is the only one that likes Full Auto.
4009240	4010240	And maybe that's true.
4010240	4012300	Maybe that's why no one else has been reporting on it, because you're the only person that
4012300	4014200	likes Full Auto.
4014200	4019200	So I didn't care for After Burner, you know, I still reported on it.
4019200	4024200	To be honest, Oblivion, it was a great game, but eh, so whatever.
4024200	4025880	Oh, I don't know about that.
4025880	4028160	Oblivion, I mean Oblivion is more than a great game.
4028160	4033520	I don't know about your, listen, Full Auto 2 is going to be fun with that one.
4033520	4038120	Granted it's exactly the same as Full Auto 1, but it's still fun.
4038120	4039120	Whatever.
4039120	4042900	Anyway, it's just to hold you over until they come out with a new Twisted Metal.
4042900	4045440	That's all that matters right there.
4045440	4048360	One thing that was kind of interesting, and we talked about it a little bit before about
4048360	4053820	Sony and the rumor that XFire is going to be teaming up with them for some online partnership
4053820	4054820	and stuff.
4054820	4056920	And Sony came out and said, no, no, no, that's not true.
4056920	4057920	That's only for one game.
4057920	4059740	Actually, no, it is true.
4059740	4061040	It actually is going to be happening.
4061040	4062840	It was officially announced.
4062840	4066880	They're going to be using the middleware, or they're going to be kind of teaming up
4066880	4074280	for a middleware solution that's going to be an add-on to the current, I guess PS3 friends
4074280	4078960	list and chatting that they're going to have in the actual PS3.
4078960	4083560	So this is going to be a little bit kind of tying into that, you know, being able to play
4083560	4087200	games on PC versus the PlayStation 3 and stuff like that.
4087200	4091880	So as mentioned before, the first title they'll actually be using that will be the new Untold
4091880	4092920	Legends game.
4092920	4095280	So it should be interesting.
4095280	4096280	See how that turns out.
4096280	4097280	I like XFire.
4097280	4099520	I actually, I really like XFire.
4099520	4103480	I think it's a pretty nice little app, even if MTV does own it, I really like it.
4103480	4104640	It's a cool little application.
4104640	4106080	So that should be interesting.
4106080	4110040	I could be some brownie points for the PlayStation 3 as far as I'm concerned.
4110040	4116240	It's going to need as many brownie points as it can get, but as far as the delay circumstances,
4116240	4122160	there's actually a rumor that came out, one of the Spanish gaming sites called Meristations
4122160	4127840	said that Kudaragi warned there would be a shortage of PS3 stock in Japan and North America
4127840	4132440	and that Europe would have to wait even longer than they already are, but a Sony spokesperson
4132440	4137080	has said that that was categorically not true.
4137080	4139360	I love how they always put modifiers on.
4139360	4141200	He was eating crayons at the time.
4141200	4142200	It's okay.
4142200	4143200	Exactly.
4143200	4144200	He was confused.
4144200	4147280	He hasn't run any media briefings since the Tokyo game show.
4147280	4153400	That's because they had him chained to his jungle gym in his house so that he wouldn't
4153400	4158360	go run out into traffic and die because they need him.
4158360	4159640	To spread weird rumors.
4159640	4166600	Well, at any rate, Sony is actually planning on shipping 6 million PS3 units on a global
4166600	4170720	scale by the end of the 2007 fiscal year.
4170720	4171720	Cool.
4171720	4173480	All right.
4173480	4174480	They can plan it.
4174480	4177360	Whether it happens or not, hey.
4177360	4180000	Do you think there will be further delays?
4180000	4181000	Despite all this?
4181000	4182520	I don't doubt it.
4182520	4184720	Possibly if they run into hardware problems.
4184720	4187840	If they run into the overheating problems or anything like that.
4187840	4189800	Something that they didn't foresee.
4189800	4193640	Well, they actually remember all those issues they had with the first model PlayStation
4193640	4194640	2.
4194640	4198600	Although, amazingly enough, I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2 and I've had
4198600	4206000	it for years and it hasn't had any problems, but a lot of them were having issues with
4206000	4208680	coming off track, overheating.
4208680	4212200	I'm seeing there actually being lots of issues for the PS3.
4212200	4214760	All right.
4214760	4216160	Let's go to some release dates.
4216160	4217800	These are things that are coming out next week.
4217800	4219840	For the most part, we know these aren't going to get delayed.
4219840	4223200	Although, hell, even sometimes things get delayed at the last minute.
4223200	4226320	In Japan, you can expect these games to be coming out very soon.
4226320	4231800	On the PlayStation 2, October 19th, Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is out.
4231800	4234440	A game called Gift Prism is coming out.
4234440	4241720	It's from Syro Interactive, a very anime-ish looking game, but it's an adventure-type game.
4241720	4244280	It's also coming in a limited edition.
4244280	4246240	Everybody's Tennis is also coming out.
4246240	4249120	The Korean version actually is coming out on October 19th.
4249120	4254160	Sudoku Master on the PlayStation 2 should also be noted that various Wild Arms games
4254160	4259000	are coming out in Sony's version of the best hits, so you can get that cheaper through
4259000	4263040	your importer if you are looking for games such as that.
4263040	4270320	Coming out on the DS, several games in the Kodomo no Tami no Yomi Kikashi series are
4270320	4271320	coming out.
4271320	4273200	I'm not sure what type of games those are.
4273200	4274200	Children's something.
4274200	4275200	Yeah.
4275200	4276200	It's some type of children's game there.
4276200	4277200	It's just a miscellaneous.
4277200	4281440	It's by Starfish who creates these games.
4281440	4282440	Several games in that series.
4282440	4284240	It's pretty awesome.
4284240	4288120	Yeah, if I understood any of what I just said, yeah, it would be pretty awesome.
4288120	4295240	Well, anyways, but actually the US is going to be getting quite a bit of stuff as well.
4295240	4301440	This week is a very good week for games, so lots of good stuff, including of course Bully,
4301440	4306360	the game that's been getting so much controversy lately on PlayStation 2.
4306360	4310680	We have Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception on the PSP.
4310680	4312680	Get your flight sim on there.
4312680	4317400	If you're looking to get your flight sim on on the PC, Microsoft's Flight Simulator X
4317400	4325360	is going to be coming out, as well as Contact on the DS, Destroy All Humans 2 on PlayStation
4325360	4326360	2 and Xbox.
4326360	4329080	The first one was really fun, so I'm looking forward to playing this one.
4329080	4333200	Family Guy on PlayStation 2, PSP, and Xbox.
4333200	4334320	That one actually looks pretty good.
4334320	4340320	I kind of thought that was going to be a crappy port of a TV show, but it looks pretty good.
4340320	4343680	And then 10 Dogs, Dalmatian, and Friends.
4343680	4349600	Why this late in the game for those that were too lazy to unlock the Dalmatian in the first
4349600	4350600	one?
4350600	4353600	Not lazy, you just had to find the hat.
4353600	4360600	Anyways, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on the 360, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent
4360600	4362600	also on the 360.
4362600	4368360	I know Sims 2 Pets will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and DS, as well as SpongeBob Creature from
4368360	4372120	Krusty Krab on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.
4372120	4373120	Yippee.
4373120	4382200	And then finally, on the PC, we have Battlefield 2142, and that is going to be coming out as
4382200	4383360	well.
4383360	4385160	But you know what?
4385160	4387920	Maybe you just don't have to tell them to go buy a game like that.
4387920	4391440	So we are going to give one away.
4391440	4393800	And how might you be able to do this, to enter in?
4393800	4395360	It's actually pretty simple.
4395360	4400040	All you have to do, and this contest will be running until Wednesday, is go to orange
4400040	4407160	launch radio dot com slash BF2142, or Battlefield 2142.
4407160	4412280	Just simply enter the contest there, and there will be a random drawing on Wednesday, and
4412280	4416360	we'll be announcing it in part A of episode 205.
4416360	4417600	And they'll be able to get that right away.
4417600	4419040	Yes, they'll be able to get it right away.
4419040	4421240	It's actually a digital distribution thing.
4421240	4426200	It's a digital download code, so you'll be able to download it straight to your PC.
4426200	4430160	So I look forward to that, and I look forward to giving a full review about the game next
4430160	4431160	week.
4431160	4433680	Now, doesn't Desperate Housewives come out this week?
4433680	4437480	Because I noticed in our chat room, somebody had said they just saw a commercial on VH1.
4437480	4438480	Who said that?
4438480	4439800	I think that was last week, to be honest.
4439800	4440800	Was it?
4440800	4441800	I think it was.
4441800	4446720	Oh, JV Mon says, a commercial for the Desperate Housewives video game just aired on VH1, which
4446720	4450680	means someone's watching Flavor of Love.
4450680	4453740	Same shame.
4453740	4455520	His career should have stayed gone when public happened.
4455520	4456520	Or to name calling.
4456520	4462200	I don't know, my attention was diverted elsewhere on the PC, whether it be Warcraft, Final Fantasy
4462200	4464040	11, Civilization, one of those other games.
4464040	4465300	I might have to go back and check out some more.
4465300	4470840	I just hear gelatinous cubes, and I think of all of my old D&D games.
4470840	4476120	But also coming out is Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent on Xbox 360.
4476120	4481320	A few other things to look forward to, by the way, is the new Blade Dancer game on PSP.
4481320	4488400	Metal Slug, King of Fighters, Neo-Geo Battle Colosseum, more stuff.
4488400	4490840	All right.
4490840	4491840	Down the line.
4491840	4498760	Have fun, you folks over in Europe, playing your renamed version of Bully.
4498760	4499760	What is up with that?
4499760	4500760	I still don't get that.
4500760	4504680	I guess Bully must have a real negative context overseas or something.
4504680	4506920	Could someone please enlighten me from overseas?
4506920	4508920	What's wrong with the word Bully?
4508920	4512640	I don't know.
4512640	4515960	This issue has been going back and forth and I'm getting to the point where I just don't
4515960	4516960	care anymore.
4516960	4518480	I guess you could call this a follow-up.
4518480	4523400	Last week we said something about how GameStop was tooting their horn that the Wii demo kiosks
4523400	4525200	were going to be exclusive to their store.
4525200	4526240	Well guess what?
4526240	4531760	Nintendo of America says, uh-uh, playable Wii setups will be available at a variety
4531760	4533200	of retail outlets.
4533200	4537360	We expect that anyone who wants to try Wii will be able to through multiple different
4537360	4538360	methods.
4538360	4541720	In addition to retail outlets, Wii will be playable at a number of mall tours throughout
4541720	4546720	the company, the nationwide Nintendo Fusion Tour, and other grassroots consumer events,
4546720	4552280	which means Loki was misinformed about this when he told us this a couple months ago in
4552280	4554720	his big scoop when the sales people were there.
4554720	4556960	GameStop was misinformed on this.
4556960	4560360	Part of me is starting to wonder if Nintendo really knows what they're doing until the
4560360	4561720	last minute on these demo kiosks.
4561720	4563120	I don't know, but whatever.
4563120	4564120	Who knows?
4564120	4565960	Maybe it's just stuff changes every day.
4565960	4570480	Now Nintendo has actually clarified that retailers will actually either be getting a traditional
4570480	4575160	pre-built interactive kiosk with the TV, Wii, and controllers, or just the Wii and controllers
4575160	4578560	that they can set up themselves.
4578560	4579560	That's pretty low-tech.
4579560	4582300	Hey, whatever works.
4582300	4587580	Maybe the whole thing, you know, I know this is getting into another story, but maybe the
4587580	4592840	whole thing has to do with interference from lighting and maybe not being able to control
4592840	4596720	it, and that might have something to do with it.
4596720	4598840	I thought that was a bunch of BS, but whatever.
4598840	4599840	Who knows?
4599840	4600840	Whatever.
4600840	4602440	It's just speculation right now.
4602440	4609180	Well, an interesting rumor has come out about the Wii console is that it might actually
4609180	4613280	be running Linux already.
4613280	4618480	So for those folks that love to install Linux on new things, whether it be the Nintendo
4618480	4626600	DS, the PSP, a toaster, a Billy Bass, whatever the hell, you know, too bad Nintendo beat
4626600	4627600	you to it.
4627600	4628600	Yes, exactly.
4628600	4641640	Apparently a Nintendo insider who blogs under the internet moniker Kiyoshi Saruwatari claims
4641640	4648640	that the Wii console will run an open source Linux OS, and of course it hasn't been confirmed
4648640	4654520	and it's purely speculation right now, but it's basically, you know, used for the back
4654520	4658900	end of, you know, using the software for, you know, porting stuff in there like the
4658900	4661360	Opera browser and stuff like that.
4661360	4667160	And it says it will be closed and will only allow signed code, but of course, you know,
4667160	4671640	anyone that remembers that kind of stuff knows that people will break that pretty quick.
4671640	4672640	Good.
4672640	4673840	Use it to break the region lock.
4673840	4677120	That's the first thing I want you Linux nerds to work on if this is indeed true and the
4677120	4678480	Wii already has it on there.
4678480	4683080	I want you to work on the region lock in case there's, you know, Oh and Don for the, you
4683080	4684080	know, Wii.
4684080	4686400	I want that shit imported ASAP.
4686400	4687400	Thank you.
4687400	4689400	Could you imagine Oh and Don on the Wii?
4689400	4694600	I'm thinking about it and I'm wearing a warm smile.
4694600	4697240	Well, as far as other things that are...
4697240	4698240	Hold on.
4698240	4699240	I'd like to...
4699240	4700240	Sorry.
4700240	4701240	And I hate having to read these.
4701240	4702520	Bad transition.
4702520	4703520	Five points from Gryffindor.
4703520	4704520	Hey.
4704520	4705520	Anyways.
4705520	4709160	I was on my way to a very wonderful transition.
4709160	4713840	And this will be the last story that we have from Kiyoshi Sarawati because apparently the
4713840	4718960	whole thing was a practical joke made up by him to get spread around the world.
4718960	4721560	So that will be nixed from the podcast.
4721560	4722560	Thank you very much.
4722560	4724080	So you just made up last five minutes.
4724080	4725080	Oh no.
4725080	4726080	I'm keeping that in.
4726080	4727080	Hey.
4727080	4728720	I am reporting the news.
4728720	4729720	Okay.
4729720	4732480	I said it was purely speculation and this is what this guy said.
4732480	4733480	It's all his fault.
4733480	4734480	Not mine.
4734480	4735480	I just...
4735480	4736480	I just report the news.
4736480	4737480	I think that's funny.
4737480	4738480	Don't shoot the messenger.
4738480	4740840	I think that's really freaking funny.
4740840	4741840	There's five minutes in my life.
4741840	4742840	I won't get back.
4742840	4747800	Speaking of things that I also think are funny is not really the story.
4747800	4756160	Nintendo has announced a launch of Live Move, which is a development tool to make it easy
4756160	4759440	to produce titles for the Wii easier and faster.
4759440	4768240	It was made by, I guess that would be iLive, an artificial intelligence specialist.
4768240	4775940	At any rate, it's supposed to help allow a developer to train the Wii remote just by
4775940	4777940	performing motions.
4777940	4783640	To quote on here from iLive's chairman Wei Yan, Live Move will allow the game industry
4783640	4788120	to move away from indirect digital control to more natural analog control for the first
4788120	4789120	time.
4789120	4799120	Ganyel Takeda, who's Nintendo's senior MD of integrated research and development, basically
4799120	4802760	said when Nintendo's development team saw Live Move, we instantly recognized how easy
4802760	4808280	it would greatly increase our ability to explore and experiment with new concepts and make
4808280	4810360	our lives easier.
4810360	4815720	So I'm looking to see what they can come up with.
4815720	4818780	Another quote on here that I think is really cool is, this revolutionary tool liberates
4818780	4822960	the imaginations of game creators, which I think actually the whole concept of having
4822960	4830360	something that you can use free motion to actually program with I think really just
4830360	4836120	links very well to the whole mission behind the Wii.
4836120	4841320	You have innovative games, but you have innovative development going with it.
4841320	4845080	Maybe some developers that want to see what's coming up in Nintendo's world might want to
4845080	4851380	check out the Nintendo Space World Show, of course the Nintendo World Show for short.
4851380	4857880	It's going to be November 3rd in Nagoya and November 12th in Osaka.
4857880	4861720	That was from Nintendo's official Japan site.
4861720	4865020	So check it out if you're over in Japan and want to check out what Nintendo's up to because
4865020	4870440	remember they don't do Tokyo Game Show, so this is kind of their version of that.
4870440	4876920	There will be of course hands-on Wii demos and new DS games.
4876920	4879960	Start saving those pennies quick.
4879960	4884240	Some interesting stuff that they're doing with the GameCube version of Twilight Princess
4884240	4888920	in Japan is only being offered online, kind of similar to what they do with Electroplankton
4888920	4889920	over here.
4889920	4894320	The main reason Nintendo is doing this is to avoid both versions of the game in stores
4894320	4896800	at the same time because of the Wii launch.
4896800	4901560	They would much rather see the Wii Zelda sell than the GameCube version and that wouldn't
4901560	4904520	be a guarantee if the two versions are on the same shelf.
4904520	4909160	There is no information on whether this same procedure will be passed on to Europe and
4909160	4910160	the U.S. as well.
4910160	4911160	Interesting.
4911160	4915000	Yeah, it'll be interesting to see if they do that in the U.S. as well.
4915000	4916000	I don't think they will.
4916000	4920040	I think there's a lot more demand for the old GameCube games here.
4920040	4924480	I think there's a lot of folks that buy the earlier generations of consoles because they're
4924480	4928080	cheaper so I think they'll still be on shelves out here.
4928080	4931840	You know what, some people might not want to use the Wii to play Zelda.
4931840	4935980	Well, wasn't there an old story that said you could plug in the old GameCube controller
4935980	4937960	and use that on the Wii version still?
4937960	4938960	I don't know.
4938960	4939960	I don't remember.
4939960	4940960	Maybe.
4940960	4944920	For me, I had a discussion with Dan about this not too long ago.
4944920	4949000	He said that he's actually thinking about just picking it up on GameCube anyway instead
4949000	4950000	of on Wii.
4950000	4952160	Just for the hell of it or just because of the controls?
4952160	4958240	The control, instead of a few things changed from the E3 demo version that I wasn't too
4958240	4965840	happy with, like not being able to use the remote actually for the sort at all, you have
4965840	4966840	to slash.
4966840	4967840	Oh, weird.
4967840	4975680	And I was like, nah, I don't like that so we're probably just getting it on GameCube.
4975680	4980920	Or you might just have both because you're a whore for Link like that, right?
4980920	4981920	Maybe?
4981920	4982920	Well, I don't know.
4982920	4983920	I didn't play Wind Waker.
4983920	4985960	I refuse to play Wind Waker.
4985960	4989260	Well that's a different, that's fake cartoony Link.
4989260	4992080	That's not the real deal.
4992080	4996480	Alright well that is about going to wrap it up for our part A but you know, over the past
4996480	5000600	few weeks we have not been able to end part A of Orange Lounge Radio until we get to some
5000600	5003780	DDR previews and that's what we're going to do right now.
5003780	5009560	We're going to take a look at some new tracks here from DDR Universe and DDR UltraMix 4.
5009560	5013080	These are new Dance Dance Revolution games coming out from Konami a little bit later this
5013080	5015200	year, possibly early next year.
5015200	5019720	We don't have a firm date on DDR Universe yet but we know sometime this winter the game
5019720	5020720	is going to be out.
5020720	5022520	So far December 2nd but that could always change.
5022520	5025200	That could always be changed, absolutely.
5025200	5029960	But it doesn't stop us from showing you some of the new mix by Jondi and Spesh and we're
5029960	5035440	going to hear the long mix right here on the DDR Sneak Peaks here on Orange Lounge Radio
5035440	5056160	coming to DDR Universe.
