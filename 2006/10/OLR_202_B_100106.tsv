0	4760	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream
4760	5760	twice weekly.
5760	12240	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links
12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	20540	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20540	25920	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 202 for this October
25920	28280	1st of 2006.
28280	31160	I can't believe the year is almost over at this point.
31160	32160	It's crazy.
32160	33160	Seriously.
33160	34160	Time just flies by.
34160	36160	Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news.
36160	37640	Loki, why don't you start us off.
37640	41960	Yes, let's start us off with the Zune.
41960	43960	The Zune, it sounds like Lune.
43960	51320	But anyways, Microsoft's brand new MP3 movie, you name it, player.
51320	54960	They announced some details at X06 about how exactly it's going to work and some of the
54960	55960	online things.
55960	62120	The 30GB version of the Zune will be sold for $249.99 when they're on sale November
62120	64920	14th in the United States.
64920	67760	The price of music is in two choices.
67760	72000	You can either buy a monthly pass for 99 cents, which will give you hearing access to all
72000	76040	these songs in the Zune marketplace.
76040	77040	But there is a catch.
77040	82360	You will not be able to listen to the songs once the pass has expired.
82360	88200	If you want to permanently buy any song, you can make it yours by spending 79 Microsoft
88200	89200	points.
89200	90200	That's right.
90200	93880	The same Microsoft points you would be buying Doom on Xbox Live Arcade, you can be spending
93880	94880	on music.
94880	99320	And of course, 79 points is roughly about 99 cents.
99320	103440	So you can either purchase the song for 99 cents or you can pay, I guess, a monthly fee
103440	105360	and listen to all the music for 99 cents.
105360	108000	But you probably have to download it each time.
108000	109800	So it's kind of interesting.
109800	111740	Kind of an interesting way to conduct business.
111740	114920	Pretty soon I'll be paying my rent in Microsoft points.
114920	117080	Kind of sad.
117080	121040	That honestly is a bit on the sad side.
121040	125480	I honestly, you know, I've had this sort of image though that the way the future is going
125480	127160	to go is going to use some sort of electronic.
127160	129480	We're already on credit cards, you know.
129480	130480	We can buy things online.
130480	132920	Man, debit and all that stuff, we're practically there.
132920	137840	It'll be like Demolition Man where they scan the barcode in our hand and we have credits
137840	138840	and if you cuss...
138840	140280	I hope not because that was kind of a crap movie.
140280	141280	Well, actually, ironically enough...
141280	142280	I love that movie.
142280	143600	I was watching this thing on the Discovery Channel.
143600	144600	They were talking about Wired.
144600	147800	It's like they have Next Fest or something like that where they're showing off, you know,
147800	148800	brand new technology.
148800	151440	Kind of like, I guess, CES or something like that.
151440	156480	But anyways, one of the technologies that they were showing off was a thumbprint scanner.
156480	161360	It's basically a thumbprint scanner and then you enter in your phone number and you'll
161360	165860	deduct, you know, money from your checking or savings account just using your thumbprint.
165860	168200	So that's pretty much going to be like the wave of the future.
168200	173480	We also have this thing where they have a chip stored in a fake tooth that's fireproof,
173480	176140	you know, bashproof pretty much.
176140	181900	So that if you were to be horribly, say, horribly burned in a fire, they can still identify
181900	183500	your remains without DNA testing.
183500	187240	You've got your tooth there with your medical records and all your information.
187240	190400	Without having to play, let's name the burn victim!
190400	192960	Well, to get back into gaming news...
192960	193960	Yes, please.
193960	197720	Now, keep in mind, I was a big tech TV fangirl.
197720	204320	For fans of Saint's Row, there is a thing called the Thunky Fresh Pack, yeah.
204320	209960	It's 100 Microsoft points and it has clothes, tattoos, hairstyles.
209960	215120	For use in single and multiplayer modes, you've also got tiger striped underwear, bunny slippers,
215120	221560	an eye patch, and a samurai helmet, medallions, and rattlesnake tattoos.
221560	226820	Gee, do I spend the 100 points to buy this crap or should I get a copy of London Bridge
226820	227820	for my Zune?
227820	229840	I just don't know.
229840	230840	I think...
230840	233600	Some people like the customization.
233600	235240	And some people like Fergie.
235240	239120	Oh my god, I had to listen to that CD yesterday.
239120	243600	My character has a pimp hat now and his dress is in really nice clothes.
243600	246960	All purple, of course, because I've got to represent Saint's Row colors in order to get
246960	255080	the more, I guess, points for missions and stuff.
255080	258240	This was kind of like the same thing we were talking about a while back, which was rumored
258240	263720	to be coming to the kiosk at GameStop for free.
263720	268200	I wish it was coming to the GameStop kiosk for free because I'd rather pick it up there.
268200	269200	Who knows?
269200	270200	Maybe it still will.
270200	271200	I hope so.
271200	272200	Some of them pay for this.
272200	276440	Well, I like free things and Midway is giving away some free things right now, namely some
276440	281800	online Flash playable copies of some of their arcade treasures.
281800	288560	You can play Bubbles, Defender 1 and 2, Joust, Rampage, Robotron 2084, which is Microsoft
288560	295000	Points on Xbox 360, Satan's Hollow, Sinistar, Spy Hunter, and Tapper.
295000	299160	Yes, you can play those all online on Midway's website.
299160	301760	Right now, if you want, it's MidwayArcade.com.
301760	303760	So who needs Midway arcade treasures, huh?
303760	305320	You got all that available for you.
305320	306320	Enjoy.
306320	307320	Exactly.
307320	308320	And you know what?
308320	311520	You've got to save money for those PlayStation 3 games, of course.
311520	316920	And as we mentioned earlier, they are going to be retailing for about $59.99 for the most
316920	318940	part, which is expected.
318940	326960	Most current gen games are peaking out about $49.99, most actually which are $39.99 now.
326960	334060	And now the next gen games are going to try to be getting $59.99 retail for most everything.
334060	343520	This is pretty much confirmed by sites like Sony style and whatnot.
343520	350240	Some games might not be $59.99 like Gran Turismo HD.
350240	352640	It's not a surprise, I would say.
352640	357800	But I'm still waiting for those companies out there to get greedy and start charging
357800	358800	more.
358800	360440	As long as those $70 and $80 rumors don't come true.
360440	364760	To be honest, though, I don't think they are because if anything, they'll try to nickel
364760	367960	and dime you on the backend with their online content.
367960	370080	That's what it's going to end up being.
370080	377320	Instead of charging $70, they can charge $900 and charge $50 for the game or something.
377320	378320	Alright.
378320	379320	Jamie.
379320	380320	What?
380320	381320	Jamie.
381320	382320	What?
382320	383320	Jamie.
383320	384320	Jamie.
384320	385320	Bob.
385320	386320	Jamie.
386320	387320	Bob.
387320	388320	Bob.
388320	389320	Bob.
389320	390320	Bob.
390320	391320	Okay.
391320	392320	So we got Kayla.
392320	400020	Kayla WWE,
400020	408020	On the sixth, we have Barnyard for a bunch of stuff.
408020	411020	We have Capcom Puzzle World on PSP.
411020	413020	Heroes of Annihilated Empires on the PC.
413020	416020	Import Tuner Challenge on Xbox 360.
416020	418020	Mage Knight Apocalypse on PC.
418020	421020	The Nintendo DS browser on the PSP.
421020	423020	I'm sorry, the DS.
423020	426020	That was a bad joke.
426020	428020	Wah wah.
428020	431020	Open Season coming out on damn near everything.
431020	433020	Put out by Ubisoft.
433020	435020	Wild Arms 4 on PlayStation 2.
435020	437020	I have to say the Wild Arms series is a good game.
437020	440020	I have a friend who is absolutely addicted to that game.
440020	443020	Wild Arms 4 is good.
443020	446020	Did Wild Arms Ultra F ever come out over there?
446020	448020	Not a series I played.
448020	450020	Hey guys, let me know if it ever came out.
450020	456020	A few things coming up though in the month to look forward to is Power Stone collection for PSP.
456020	459020	English training, have fun improving your skills on the DS.
459020	462020	That's actually pretty funny.
462020	466020	Resident Evil 4 Platinum, Sims 2 Pets coming out.
466020	475020	They're getting Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Budokai 2 and Metal Slug Anthology.
475020	476020	That's pretty cool.
476020	479020	The US isn't going to see too much this week.
479020	481020	There are some pretty good games there.
481020	486020	FIFA Soccer 07 if you're a soccer fan coming out in almost every single system.
486020	490020	You do have also Star Trek Encounters coming out on the PlayStation 2.
490020	493020	A great Star Trek combat game.
493020	496020	Very cheap, $19.99.
496020	498020	So check it out if you can.
498020	501020	I think actually it might even be $14.99.
501020	503020	I know it's very cheap, but that's all I know.
503020	509020	Anyways, another crappy game, Snow Cross 2 featuring Air Blur Morgan.
509020	515020	And by the way, this game has been delayed for a year, so it's crap.
515020	520020	Let's see, Mercury Meltdown for the PSP, which is equal for the first Mercury game.
520020	524020	And I don't know if this is worth your money, but if you want, pick it up.
524020	528020	Gangs of London, definitely a better game for the PSP.
528020	535020	Also on the PC we have El Matador and Paparazzi.
535020	537020	So that's some interesting stuff.
537020	541020	How could I not forget Scarface, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
541020	547020	Now a lot of places are reporting that this is the 8th of October, but it's actually the 5th.
547020	553020	It has a soft street date on it, so stores will be getting it on the 5th, but they cannot advertise it until the 8th.
553020	555020	So weird.
555020	560020	Go bug your GameStops, because that's probably the game you're going to want that week.
560020	563020	Alright, well over in Japan we have some release dates for the week.
563020	565020	Honestly, not a whole lot coming out this week.
565020	568020	It's kind of a slow week over there as well.
568020	574020	NBA Live 07 and FIFA Soccer 07 both coming out this week.
574020	581020	Shinobido Imashime, also known as Spike the Best, is coming out over there this week as well.
581020	585020	And Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is coming out this week.
585020	589020	Front Mission 5 in the Ultimate Hits Collection, hit stores this week in Japan as well.
589020	598020	And for you music game fans who have about $250 to spare, you can get your Guitar Freaks ASC arcade-style controller this week.
598020	600020	That's awesome.
600020	611020	Well, as far as other releases for the UK going back to them, they're actually, for fans who are football nuts,
611020	620020	there's Pro Evolution Soccer 6 coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC on 27th October, of course out by Konami.
620020	625020	PSP and DS versions will be coming.
625020	634020	They're actually stating that the 360 version is going to be noticeably improved.
634020	644020	The AI anyway is. They actually specifically named it in areas like the AI players running into space.
644020	645020	That's not going to happen.
645020	648020	It also runs in high definition and widescreen.
648020	661020	It will also feature new licensed clubs, including Manchester United, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, and Olympiasos.
661020	671020	New kits and squads for Czech, French, Australian, English, Italian, Argentinian, Spanish, and Swedish National.
671020	675020	I know we've got some football fans listening.
675020	685020	Some other things you might be able to look forward to on the next-gen consoles, other than football, would be Castlevania.
685020	693020	More Castlevania games are on the way, including more 2D Castlevania games, Promises, Koji, and Higurashi.
693020	700020	Now, of course, Xbox Live Arcade will be seeing Symphony of the Night at some point, as they've announced previously,
700020	708020	but we might see even maybe the original Castlevania, Simon's Quest, 3, who knows?
708020	719020	From the sounds of it, he says, I hope more people will enjoy 2D Castlevania experience as a result of it, talking about the three systems succeeding.
719020	722020	He thinks all three of them are going to do well.
722020	732020	Basically, he's up for doing more 2D Castlevania, so maybe we'll see some exclusive stuff on the next-gen marketplaces.
732020	740020	Please, some more 2D Castlevania, or you can do that subtle hints of 3D, kind of like if you look at Symphony of the Night.
740020	746020	Just make a real grand 2D Castlevania for the next-gen. It would be awesome.
746020	749020	Just because you're next-gen doesn't mean everything has to be 3D.
749020	755020	Look at a game like Viewtiful Joe. It was a great 2D using next-gen graphics.
755020	760020	Anyway, if you still want to live in the current generation, well, this might be the controller for you.
760020	763020	This is a controller that would be great for throwing against the wall.
763020	770020	Everybody has a friend like this, somebody who gets so frustrated, or maybe a sibling, that they throw the controller against the wall,
770020	773020	or they throw it at people when they get really frustrated with the game.
773020	777020	Well, now you have a Nerf controller.
777020	780020	That's right, there's a PlayStation 2 controller that's covered in Nerf.
780020	787020	It's like this bluish color here, and it's coming out for the PlayStation 2, and it's wireless.
787020	793020	It comes in black, blue, red, or orange. It'll be about $30, and comes out in November of 2006.
793020	797020	That's right, the official Nerf controller, perfect for throwing around, although I wouldn't recommend it.
797020	799020	You could still break the damn thing.
799020	801020	Or somebody.
801020	808020	It's still kind of heavy. Just because it's Nerf-made doesn't mean it's safe to chuck at people's heads, but it at least would hurt a lot less.
808020	818020	Speaking about breaking people, there was the Uwe Boll boxing matches going on recently, and as expected, you know,
818020	821020	nothing's going to be fair when it comes down to Uwe Boll.
821020	831020	In fact, Richard Lotak-Kanka was one of the people from Something Awful to actually be able to fight in this,
831020	837020	and he kind of gave a little bit of a background to these whole boxing matches.
837020	844020	Apparently, they were supposed to be a PR stunt, which is, you know, pretty obvious, and all the punches were supposed to be kind of fake.
844020	847020	Also, that they were supposed to be given training.
847020	849020	So it was supposed to be like wrestling.
849020	855020	Pretty much. And it was supposed to be, you know, they were supposed to be given training beforehand.
855020	862020	So, you know, there were going to be five contenders, but apparently one of them had to be pulled out of the competition
862020	866020	because he had a boxing background, and Uwe Boll wasn't like a fair fight.
866020	876020	So out of the four people, including one 17-year-old, everyone, you know, pretty much got beat the crap out of.
876020	879020	Is that legal, to beat the crap out of a 17-year-old like that?
879020	882020	Well, I guess it was Canada. Maybe the laws are different there. I don't know.
882020	885020	I guess he signed a waiver. Maybe the parents signed a waiver as well.
885020	888020	Video's out there on YouTube, so check it out.
888020	898020	To be honest, I don't know, you know, Richard Lotax, or Lotax from Something Awful,
898020	904020	his whole thing is, you know, he didn't really hate Uwe Boll before this whole thing, and now he does.
904020	907020	He thinks he's a douche, basically.
907020	911020	Wonder Dog Harold sums it up in our chat room and says, Uwe Boll is such a pig fucker.
911020	914020	It doesn't matter. Okay, big deal. So you beat up some critics.
914020	920020	Ooh, you beat up critics that had no boxing training, and one person that actually might give you some competition,
920020	922020	you pussied out, you fucker.
922020	926020	Didn't one of the critics that came out of this say that, you know, although the fight was kind of a joke,
926020	930020	the new movie's not bad, or something like the clips they saw from the new movie didn't seem that bad?
930020	937020	I don't see how they can mess up, you know, Postal. I mean, that one I'm interested in seeing, actually.
937020	942020	But I think the new movie, In the Name of the King or whatever, that's going to suck donkey balls.
942020	946020	And know what's even worse about it? It's two fucking parts, so it's like four hours long.
946020	951020	No, thank you. I will not be seeing your two crappy-ass halves of movies.
951020	952020	You know what I would pay to see?
952020	953020	What?
953020	957020	Jack Thompson versus Uwe Boll. Seriously, to death.
957020	960020	Why isn't Jack Thompson coming after him for beating up on 17-year-olds?
960020	966020	Because he's too busy trying to involve himself by, oh, God, Roboy linked me to this article.
966020	973020	He's aligning himself with the defense for some cases. It's just a bunch of bullshit.
973020	977020	Well, you'll notice I purposely omitted that from tonight's show role because I didn't want to give him any more attention.
977020	978020	Sorry.
978020	985020	Well, the one thing that I think is worth mentioning for this is that it's probably something to lightly get him disbarred in that state, so let's hope that happens.
985020	986020	Hooray.
986020	992020	Well, God, all this talk of Uwe Boll and Jack Thompson puts me in a foul mood, so you know what that means, right, Dark Sakura?
992020	1003020	Hmm.
1003020	1005020	The FUs of the week, Dark Sakura.
1005020	1011020	My FU of the week goes primarily, there are some exceptions, to straight men.
1011020	1024020	Oh, yes. Just because I'm a woman doesn't give you the right to look at me, see me there, and then proceed to back into me and elbow me in the shoulder while trying to take a picture at the wax museum.
1024020	1029020	And then it doesn't give you permission to just expect me to move out of the way when you're going to open a door.
1029020	1036020	I paid to be there. You are going to freaking respect my personal space. Fuck you and your cock.
1036020	1037020	But not literally.
1037020	1038020	No.
1038020	1045020	It goes to this whole attitude of, I'm a man, you're a woman, you have to move, you have to do what I say, blah, blah, blah.
1045020	1046020	Fuck you.
1046020	1049020	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
1049020	1051020	You know what?
1051020	1056020	The whole, I hate how, I hope you're not, this isn't towards you.
1056020	1059020	Well, I'm just saying, how did you know his sexual orientation?
1059020	1061020	His wife was there.
1061020	1062020	Does that mean anything?
1062020	1064020	Trust me.
1064020	1067020	I have infallible gay dark.
1067020	1078020	These people, the only way that I think that there would be any remotely gay vibe coming from them is if they were like, you know, bare leather daddies or something.
1078020	1081020	Which I saw plenty of today.
1081020	1082020	But no.
1082020	1085020	All our listeners of the show are accepted from this, fuck you, right?
1085020	1086020	Yeah.
1086020	1087020	Yes, yes.
1087020	1093020	But I hate, especially, I hate the whole, the flock of testosterone.
1093020	1094020	You know what I mean?
1094020	1106020	When you get, like, I guess the football man where it's like, we're going to drink beer and go hooters.
1106020	1113020	We're going to, to quote Margaret Cho, we're going to order titties with wet dressing and celery sticks.
1113020	1117020	That's just, okay.
1117020	1118020	All right.
1118020	1119020	No, no, no.
1119020	1127020	Like I said, this is not centered toward all straight men, this is just centered toward stupid straight men.
1127020	1132020	All right, Loki, speaking of stupid straight men, Loki, you know how they actually serve Hooters at Hooter?
1132020	1136020	That might be worth, you know, the price of admission right there, but not their food size.
1136020	1147020	You know, actually, ironically enough, fuck you to stupid women drivers who can't fucking pay attention on the road because you're talking to your kids or talking on the cell phone or fucking around with something on your dash.
1147020	1153020	You know, I know I understand that those complex SUVs that you drive are so, you know, beyond you.
1153020	1161020	But, you know, could you do us all a favor and stay at home so I don't have to bother, you know, driving behind you because you're too fucking slow or retarded?
1161020	1164020	Thank you.
1164020	1170020	You have to remember we have, we have folks all around the world listening and not everyone knows what Hooters is.
1170020	1179020	Hooters is this, um, eatery where you can order hot wings and that's about all that's decent on the menu and they're not even very good because they taste like vinegar.
1179020	1185020	And they're served by women, um, wearing really small gym shorts.
1185020	1187020	Cheerleader outfits, essentially.
1187020	1192020	Not quite, because they're not little skirts, they're just those uber, they're the shorts that you can see ass cheeks through.
1192020	1199020	And, and actually I read an article about a girl who went inside on, on Hooters just to try to find out what went on behind the scenes.
1199020	1204020	They give you, they ask you what your t-shirt size is and they give you one that's two sizes too small.
1204020	1206020	Lovely.
1206020	1209020	And basically you're there for boobs.
1209020	1215020	Which I have no problem with personally, but I hate the whole mentality that spawned it.
1215020	1220020	And a question from our chat room from someone from abroad who doesn't know better, uh, is there a male version?
1220020	1221020	There should be.
1221020	1228020	When I was in high school, one of my people who was in band with me that I used to march next to, she said that they should open a restaurant called Pecker's.
1228020	1232020	Where it's men in Speedos that wear their aprons backwards.
1232020	1235020	Did you have any other FUs?
1235020	1243020	Uh, just actually the Hooters, this is kind of a, you know, an old FU, but FU the Hooters because their service does suck.
1243020	1248020	I mean, you might go there saying, oh yeah, we're gonna go get served by, you know, hot chicks.
1248020	1255020	The chicks are dumb and the service is awful and they can't get anything right and it took them like two hours to serve like hot wings.
1255020	1259020	Which is their staple food at this goddamn place and they can't prepare that even quick enough.
1259020	1265020	Then they, you know, jump around and dance and stuff and just act obnoxious and annoying the whole time.
1265020	1271020	It's obviously not worth the trip, so go to a strip club if you really want to eat with boobs around you. Seriously.
1271020	1274020	What was that one strip club that you said had really good food?
1274020	1275020	I think it was Centerfolds.
1275020	1276020	Do you wanna go?
1276020	1278020	Sure, why not? It'll be fun.
1278020	1285020	Well, Nellie will want to go. Alright, we'll all go. We'll be at OLR. We'll have a staff meeting at Centerfolds. That'll be fun.
1285020	1286020	That'll be excellent.
1286020	1289020	Alright, we'll do that. Our next OLR staff meeting at the titty bar.
1289020	1297020	Um, let's see, um, my FU of the week goes to Philips, the company that made my last television.
1297020	1302020	Just over one year after buying the thing, we stopped working.
1302020	1309020	You would turn on the TV, my nice new high-definition TV, you turn it on, then the image would get really bright and then it would shut off.
1309020	1311020	And it broke. The damn TV broke.
1311020	1316020	But thank you to Costco, who's now my favorite store ever. They have the best return policy in the world.
1316020	1321020	I took the TV back and got a new TV from a different company that hopefully will work for more than a year.
1321020	1324020	Did it have the red eye of death on it? Like that 360?
1324020	1331020	No, it did not have the three rings of death on it. It just, it would come up, it would shut off and then that little flashing green light would come on.
1331020	1333020	Flash, flash, flash, and that's all it would do.
1333020	1336020	So I'm tempting you, I have power, but I'm not going to work.
1336020	1342020	Bobby's offering to fly out here for the staff meeting.
1342020	1344020	You are more than welcome to attend.
1344020	1347020	We can talk about all games business as well at the meeting.
1347020	1348020	That would be pretty funny.
1348020	1351020	You know, that just sounds like it would be lots of fun.
1351020	1352020	It is fun.
1352020	1358020	Strippers are nice people. One of my roommates from, actually ex-roommates from college, well, suitemates, she was a stripper.
1358020	1363020	You know, it is funny, like, you know, people go, but Sky, you're gay, how can you enjoy the titty bar?
1363020	1367020	Look, the same reason my straight friends end up enjoying the gay bar every time I take them.
1367020	1370020	You know, I have very few straight friends who complain about the gay bar.
1370020	1374020	I think it's only fair if I'm, if they're going to go there, I should go to the titty bar.
1374020	1375020	And it's funny, it's fun.
1375020	1378020	I complain about the excessive amount of karaoke that's about it.
1378020	1382020	And I would have to agree though with SSJ100, Matt, I think that was who said it.
1382020	1387020	Boobs are a lot more sanitary than cock.
1387020	1393020	Alright, well, we are going back into the news now, and this has absolutely nothing to do...
1393020	1396020	We're made an adult this time around.
1396020	1399020	This absolutely has nothing to do with titties, but it is a little foul.
1399020	1404020	If you ever watch South Park, you know, it's a little bit dirty, but in that way that we all love.
1404020	1411020	Well, it looks like on South Park's season premiere, they're going to be spoofing World of Warcraft.
1411020	1417020	And a little 15-second teaser hit the internet this week, and it says the World of Warcraft,
1417020	1420020	shows the World of Warcraft, and then we hear that all too familiar voice.
1420020	1423020	Alright, this is it!
1423020	1427020	I need to play World of Warcraft!
1427020	1429020	Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
1429020	1431020	Killed faster!
1431020	1435020	Yes, that's right, this Wednesday on Comedy Central, that should be interesting.
1435020	1438020	World of Warcraft is going to be hitting South Park.
1438020	1441020	Yeah, you know, I enjoy South Park.
1441020	1442020	I've seen quite a few episodes.
1442020	1446020	It's one of my guilty pleasures, and I'm sure it's going to be hilarious.
1446020	1448020	You know, they've spoofed games before.
1448020	1455020	They've spoofed DDR, and they've spoofed the golden PSP.
1455020	1457020	Remember that whole episode with the Terry Schiavo thing?
1457020	1458020	Yeah.
1458020	1459020	Yeah, so they've spoofed stuff before.
1459020	1465020	So we thought it would be fun to bring back an old favorite segment of ours tonight,
1465020	1467020	and have a little fun with this topic.
1467020	1470020	We're going to play Listless.
1470020	1476020	Alright, the way Listless works is that we're going to come up with the definitive list
1476020	1481020	of Orange Lounge Radio's top something with whatever category we're doing tonight.
1481020	1484020	And as a follow-up to this story, the category we're going to do tonight is
1484020	1488020	game that South Park most needs to make fun of.
1488020	1491020	Now obviously we can't do World of Warcraft, and we can't do DDR.
1491020	1493020	Here's the way Listless works.
1493020	1496020	All of the hosts are going to go around and name their top three,
1496020	1500020	and then we're going to go around and eliminate one off the list,
1500020	1502020	so it gets a little vicious in here.
1502020	1504020	Now usually this game is played with four people,
1504020	1506020	but since there's only three of us here in studio,
1506020	1510020	we've asked one of our frequent callers and emailers to join us tonight.
1510020	1512020	Caller, are you there?
1512020	1514020	Uh, no.
1514020	1515020	I guess you must be, smartass.
1515020	1517020	What's your name? Introduce yourself.
1517020	1518020	DMN.
1518020	1520020	Hello, DMN. How you doing?
1520020	1521020	I'm doing pretty good.
1521020	1523020	Are you excited to play Listless with us tonight?
1523020	1524020	Oh, yeah.
1524020	1527020	It was funny. I asked DMN, I'm like, DMN, you want to play Listless with us tonight?
1527020	1528020	He's like, what?
1528020	1532020	I guess we haven't played this game in a while.
1532020	1535020	Sometimes people recognize it from the little theme song we play,
1535020	1537020	a little, you know, come on down, come on down.
1537020	1538020	Anyway, all right, forget it.
1538020	1539020	Let's get to the list, shall we?
1539020	1541020	I'll get one dollar.
1541020	1543020	No, wrong game, DMN.
1543020	1544020	Wrong game.
1544020	1545020	We're making a list.
1545020	1548020	All right, and just for that smartass remark, I'm going to make you go first.
1548020	1553020	What would be your number three pick for game that South Park most needs to make fun of?
1553020	1554020	Night Trap.
1554020	1555020	Night Trap.
1555020	1557020	Winner.
1557020	1560020	The old Sega CD game starring Dana Plato.
1560020	1561020	Oh, yeah.
1561020	1562020	That's a great one.
1562020	1563020	Good job.
1563020	1564020	You're good at this game, DMN.
1564020	1566020	We'll see if the rest of your list is up to par, though.
1566020	1568020	But first, well, not yet, not yet.
1568020	1569020	We've got to go to Loki.
1569020	1571020	Loki, you're number three.
1571020	1575020	I would say Grand Theft Auto.
1575020	1577020	Grand Theft Auto.
1577020	1579020	Is there a particular one in the series you think it should?
1579020	1580020	San Andreas.
1580020	1581020	Because that would be fun.
1581020	1582020	Okay, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.
1582020	1583020	Excellent.
1583020	1585020	Dark Sakura, what would be your number three?
1585020	1587020	Karaoke Revolution.
1587020	1588020	Karaoke Revolution.
1588020	1591020	Would you like American Idol type style?
1591020	1593020	That's just what I see happening.
1593020	1594020	All right, that works.
1594020	1596020	Oh, by the way, just a quick disclaimer.
1596020	1600020	We don't claim to be South Park gurus, so if we accidentally name something that South
1600020	1603020	Park already made fun of, our bad.
1603020	1605020	I have watched most of the episodes.
1605020	1608020	This is like well over 100 that have been made, so I haven't seen them all, but I've
1608020	1609020	seen a lot.
1609020	1610020	I've probably seen about 100.
1610020	1614020	All right, my number three pick would be, oh, this is too easy, because just imagine
1614020	1619020	they could make fun of cosplaying if they did Final Fantasy.
1619020	1626020	All right, so so far on our list, we have Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas,
1626020	1628020	Karaoke Revolution, and Final Fantasy.
1628020	1631020	DMN, what would be your number two pick?
1631020	1634020	Custer's Revenge.
1634020	1636020	Custer's Revenge.
1636020	1641020	The old Atari 2600 classic, yes?
1641020	1642020	Yes.
1642020	1647020	Yes, where you can rape and pillage in very, very pixelated format.
1647020	1649020	That would be interesting to see on South Park.
1649020	1650020	I don't know.
1650020	1653020	All right, well at least they both have crappy animation, so you know it would work out.
1653020	1655020	Loki will be your number two pick.
1655020	1657020	Oh, this is tough.
1657020	1664020	I guess Twisted Metal, because that would be funny.
1664020	1666020	Twisted Metal, interesting.
1666020	1667020	All right.
1667020	1668020	Just because it's interesting?
1668020	1671020	Because it has lots of cars with guns on them.
1671020	1672020	Oh, okay.
1672020	1674020	Dark Soccer, your number two pick.
1674020	1675020	Mario Kart.
1675020	1676020	Mario Kart.
1676020	1682020	Just imagine they throw, what was the ball-shaped kid's name?
1682020	1683020	I don't remember.
1683020	1684020	The Little Canadian.
1684020	1685020	Oh, Ike?
1685020	1686020	Ike.
1686020	1688020	You know how they throw Ike as a thing, and then throw Kenny Ted?
1688020	1692020	Didn't they have a South Park game that was kind of like Mario Kart?
1692020	1693020	Yeah.
1693020	1696020	But they never really referenced it on the show, so I guess it could work.
1696020	1697020	All right, we'll see.
1697020	1698020	All right.
1698020	1699020	Let's see, my number two.
1699020	1705020	My number two would be Silent Hill, because they not only have the games, but now the
1705020	1706020	movie that they could spoof.
1706020	1710020	And you know you want to see Pyramid Head in a little cheesy South Park form.
1710020	1711020	And he could kill Kenny.
1711020	1712020	I have to draw that now, you know.
1712020	1713020	He could kill Kenny.
1713020	1714020	He'll be great.
1714020	1716020	All right, here we go.
1716020	1717020	Number one picks.
1717020	1720020	DMN, what would be your number one pick?
1720020	1725020	Well, seeing as we're on the topic of crappy games, I thought I'd say, hey, why doesn't
1725020	1727020	South Park make fun of South Park?
1727020	1731020	So South Park, the game.
1731020	1732020	Yes.
1732020	1733020	Interesting.
1733020	1735020	Interesting little play.
1735020	1739020	Why doesn't South Park make fun of itself and its own crappy game that came out?
1739020	1740020	Yeah.
1740020	1741020	Good thought.
1741020	1742020	Good thought.
1742020	1743020	Which one?
1743020	1744020	The Nintendo 64 one?
1744020	1745020	Yes.
1745020	1746020	Yeah, okay.
1746020	1747020	Good.
1747020	1748020	All right.
1748020	1749020	Loki, your number one pick.
1749020	1750020	That would be funny.
1750020	1751020	I like that idea.
1751020	1752020	Katamari Damacy.
1752020	1759020	Did you see that commercial this week that was kind of inspired by Katamari Damacy?
1759020	1763020	Yeah, except the people who made it say they were not inspired by the game in any way.
1763020	1765020	I don't watch TV, so I have no idea what it is.
1765020	1766020	It's on YouTube.
1766020	1767020	Okay.
1767020	1768020	That's the new TV.
1768020	1769020	All right.
1769020	1770020	Dark Sakura, what would be your number one?
1770020	1771020	The Sims.
1771020	1772020	The Sims.
1772020	1773020	Oh, that's a good one.
1773020	1776020	Imagine they do have somebody controlling them walking around town.
1776020	1777020	Good one.
1777020	1778020	Good one.
1778020	1779020	All right.
1779020	1784020	First, before I name my number one, let's go and look at some chat room picks.
1784020	1786020	Here's some things the chat room are suggesting.
1786020	1789020	O.L. Army Eddie says, Dead or Alive.
1789020	1791020	GS68 says, Mortal Kombat.
1791020	1792020	Let's see.
1792020	1794020	Drew Nami says, Africa.
1794020	1797020	Mechlar says, Loco Roco.
1797020	1799020	GS68 says, Genji 2.
1799020	1802020	Ravens Dolphin says, Dead Rising.
1802020	1804020	Blazer says, Gradius.
1804020	1805020	All very good guesses.
1805020	1807020	Loco Roco would be funny with Cartman.
1807020	1808020	That would be funny.
1808020	1810020	How about Your Mom the Game last night?
1810020	1811020	All right.
1811020	1812020	Here it is in bed.
1812020	1813020	Ooh.
1813020	1814020	All right.
1814020	1815020	Here it is.
1815020	1816020	My number one pick is none of those.
1816020	1819420	It's a game that desperately needs to be made fun of, especially after this week that I
1819420	1821020	got my hands on it.
1821020	1824020	Sonic the Hedgehog for 360.
1824020	1827020	All right.
1827020	1834980	So, here's the list as it stands so far, and we're going to have to take one of these off
1834980	1835980	the list, DMN.
1835980	1838980	You've got to take one of these off the list, and unfortunately the chat room will not be
1838980	1842520	able to vote for it because you've ruined their hopes and dreams to be able to vote
1842520	1843520	for it.
1843520	1844520	Here it is.
1844520	1845520	Here's the list as it stands so far.
1845520	1852140	Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Karaoke Revolution, Final Fantasy, Custer's
1852140	1859940	Revenge, Twisted Metal, Mario Kart, Silent Hill, South Park the Game, Katamari Damacy,
1859940	1863220	The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.
1863220	1866420	DMN, which one of these do you say South Park should not make fun of?
1866420	1868300	Which should come off the list?
1868300	1872460	Twisted Metal.
1872460	1873460	Twisted Metal.
1873460	1876020	Yeah, that was a little obscure, wasn't it?
1876020	1877020	All right, Loki.
1877020	1878020	This is too old.
1878020	1879020	Yeah, it is a little obscure.
1879020	1880020	Too old.
1880020	1883020	All right, Loki, what's coming off the list?
1883020	1884020	South Park the Game.
1884020	1886940	It's a crappy game, but it just wouldn't be funny.
1886940	1888780	You're not into the whole self-parody thing?
1888780	1890940	I think it just wouldn't be that funny.
1890940	1891940	All right.
1891940	1900020	Dark Sakura, what's coming off the list?
1900020	1901820	Night Trap would be too obscure.
1901820	1903100	Night Trap is too obscure.
1903100	1909580	As much as I agree, either Night Trap or Sewer Shark or something, nobody, unless they were
1909580	1914540	in our age range of gamer, probably wouldn't get it.
1914540	1916980	All right.
1916980	1920740	Every pick that's left here is actually pretty good, so this is hard for me to take one off.
1920740	1922940	I'm going to take off... Jamie, don't hate me.
1922940	1927140	I'm taking off Karaoke Revolution, because since they already made fun of DDR, it's kind
1927140	1930220	of close for me, so... All right.
1930220	1931220	Rob.
1931220	1932220	What?
1932220	1933220	What?
1933220	1934220	Rob.
1934220	1935220	What?
1935220	1936220	What?
1936220	1937220	All right.
1937220	1938220	Hi.
1938220	1939220	I hate you.
1939220	1940220	No, you don't.
1940220	1941220	All right, here we go, Chat Room.
1941220	1943420	You now have the chance to vote on your favorite.
1943420	1948700	I need you to give a number one and a number two, and here is what you get to vote on.
1948700	1951540	All right, and DMN, you don't get to vote, because you already helped.
1951540	1952540	Okay.
1952540	1953540	All right, here it is.
1953540	1954940	Here's the list, and I posted it there in Chat.
1954940	1960780	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Final Fantasy, Custer's Revenge, Mario Kart, Silent Hill,
1960780	1965400	Katamari Damacy, The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.
1965400	1966540	Place votes now.
1966540	1968380	Your number one and number two picks.
1968380	1971660	Send a private message to Sky in the Chat Room with your vote.
1971660	1974340	Remember, it doesn't count unless it's over private message.
1974340	1977300	We'll tally up the votes and reveal it shortly here in the show.
1977300	1979400	DMN, thanks for your help.
1979400	1980400	No problem.
1980400	1981400	You guys have a good night.
1981400	1983460	Hey, anything else you wanted to get out, since we probably won't get back to you during
1983460	1984460	call-ins?
1984460	1987420	Anything else you wanted to get out of your system while we have you on the line?
1987420	1989740	No, I can save it for another show, I think.
1989740	1990740	All right.
1990740	1991740	Fair enough.
1991740	1992740	All right.
1992740	1995020	Well, DMN, thanks for being here, and you're going to be here in person in about a month,
1995020	1996020	right?
1996020	1997020	Yeah.
1997020	1998020	That should be interesting.
1998020	1999020	All right.
1999020	2000020	I'll get to it.
2000020	2001020	See you later.
2001020	2002020	All right.
2002020	2003020	Bye.
2003020	2004020	Bye.
2004020	2005020	Bye.
2005020	2006020	All right.
2006020	2007020	Well, some interesting stuff.
2007020	2012020	It's been pretty dark, but the whole controversy with Bully, apparently, people were wrong.
2012020	2021900	It says Bully has been shown to, E3 was shown to a very few press people, but now that it's
2021900	2027380	almost out, actually, in the next couple of weeks, it's been shown to a lot more people.
2027380	2034300	Actually, the game itself, which garnered a teen rating, isn't as controversial as it
2034300	2038060	seems and, actually, pretty fun.
2038060	2043100	Unfortunately, since all these outrageous claims are made by people that, well, haven't
2043100	2048380	played the game, it's kind of a whole situation where a lot of people have egg on their face
2048380	2049380	now.
2049380	2056180	So, take that, JT.
2056180	2057180	All right.
2057180	2061620	Speaking of politically oriented things, we love those guys over at Game Politics.
2061620	2066860	We just wanted to give a mention that gamepolitics.com has launched this week and, unfortunately,
2066860	2070180	it means they have come off of LiveJournal for their commenting system, but they have
2070180	2075460	a fancy-schmancy new website made in WordPress, so you should check it out, gamepolitics.com.
2075460	2079760	We just wanted to give them a shout out and Dark Soccer is going to give another website
2079760	2082900	or a shout out right now because she surfs the web up and down every week.
2082900	2083900	At work.
2083900	2087900	At work, so she can find a pick worthy to share with the rest of you all and it's her
2087900	2088900	website of the week.
2088900	2089900	Here it is.
2089900	2096420	You know, we should really be using the Mr. Rogers music for this part.
2096420	2097420	Maybe next week.
2097420	2098420	Okay.
2098420	2102740	At any rate, my site of the week is actually one that another of our listeners linked to
2102740	2107780	me when I did the Dr. Who site last week, but it's actually a very good Dr. Who fan
2107780	2108780	site.
2108780	2111300	It's Dr. Who online.
2111300	2121540	The website address is drwho-online.co.uk and Dr. is drwho-online.co.uk.
2121540	2124020	Oh my God, this site is fantastic.
2124020	2131940	They actually have the Dr. Who Online Whocast, which I'm going to be giving a try within
2131940	2132940	the week.
2132940	2135780	Lots of this really good stuff.
2135780	2142300	They have a little area called psychic paper references, just a lot of stuff.
2142300	2144700	Even an eBay link to a shop.
2144700	2146900	It's a really fantastic site.
2146900	2157460	I suggest going to it if there's a place to comment or if someone sent you an email.
2157460	2158460	Excellent.
2158460	2162900	Well, got some cool stuff here, especially from the folks that make Gears of War epic.
2162900	2171100	Your thought on the whole Xbox 360 is you don't need to have an HDTV to be able to enjoy
2171100	2173220	their games.
2173220	2180380	They are making sure by testing their game, Gears of War, on a bunch of small SDTVs, making
2180380	2185620	sure that you can read the text in the game, unlike say Capcom who couldn't give a flying
2185620	2192360	fuck that you don't have a HDTV, so at least someone's getting it right.
2192360	2193860	It's awfully good.
2193860	2194860	Very reassuring.
2194860	2201500	Well, in other reassuring news, actually, for anyone who's thinking that, oh, Wii's
2201500	2204860	coming out, I don't have to keep my GameCube stuff, no.
2204860	2212860	The Wavebirds are apparently going to be able to be used on the Wii and certain Wii games.
2212860	2216620	You will still need your receiver plug-in.
2216620	2220260	There's a slot on top of the console that you can plug that into.
2220260	2224700	But there's not really any word out as far as how well it's going to work with Virtual
2224700	2233380	Console, but it's apparently going to work with the Wii anyway, so yay.
2233380	2234380	All right.
2234380	2237820	Well, I'm still trying to tally up the Listless votes, so maybe we ought to just go on to
2237820	2238820	our next story.
2238820	2239820	We got flooded with...
2239820	2240820	That's me again.
2240820	2242780	We have over 50 votes tonight for Listless.
2242780	2243780	I'm trying to crazy tally them up.
2243780	2244780	I'm sorry, Bobby.
2244780	2245780	Nice try.
2245780	2246780	Nice try.
2246780	2253900	Well, you know, for anybody who is a bit of a snake charmer, you can play with your snake
2253900	2257780	in public, no less, and not get arrested for it.
2257780	2263620	There are already Metal Gear Solid 4 figures that will go out with the release of the game
2263620	2264620	on the PS3.
2264620	2267900	A 12-inch tall made by MediComp.
2267900	2271800	MediComp puts out some really nice figures, by the way.
2271800	2277860	There's a prototype model up on gaygamer.net that looks pretty cool.
2277860	2279940	Snake's just really old, though.
2279940	2281500	I'm sorry.
2281500	2292900	But the figure, though, is they're stating that it may be something about 95,000 yen,
2292900	2299700	up to maybe 20,000, so I don't know.
2299700	2306540	I do think the comment on the forum here is, Snake's got a great ass for an old guy.
2306540	2307540	That's true.
2307540	2311500	Snake does have a good ass for an old guy.
2311500	2312940	So Rod, how's the tallying going?
2312940	2314820	I'm almost done.
2314820	2316900	I was not anticipating this many votes.
2316900	2317900	This is crazy.
2317900	2321520	You guys are making this live experience an awesome one, although a lot of work.
2321520	2322520	You know what?
2322520	2325020	If Drew comes back next week, he's going to be the vote tallyer in the future.
2325020	2326020	Well, I'll tell you what.
2326020	2327020	In the meantime...
2327020	2328020	Do you have some last-minute stories?
2328020	2329020	Yes.
2329020	2330020	Let's get right to the end of the show.
2330020	2331020	I will kill time for you.
2331020	2332020	First off...
2332020	2336460	We will be opening up the Skype line very soon, ladies and gentlemen, 916-226-9067.
2336460	2337960	Keep in mind that is a toll call.
2337960	2341520	By the way, toll-free number coming by the end of the month.
2341520	2342520	So that's awesome.
2342520	2343860	It's going to be awesome.
2343860	2345280	Also, you can always call us.
2345280	2351480	The other free way would be to go on to orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us, and get the information
2351480	2354280	on Skype, username orangeloungeradio.
2354280	2355280	Go for it, Loki.
2355280	2360640	Anyways, as we like to do every week, we're reporting some stuff that you might not know
2360640	2363480	yet, because it hasn't been reported on the front of a magazine.
2363480	2368520	Well, the first, of course, actually the only one I have this week is Call of Duty 2 on
2368520	2372120	the Xbox 360, dropped down to $39.99.
2372120	2377100	So if you don't own it yet, might be a time to find a used one, now they should be even
2377100	2383820	cheaper than that, although, I mean, Call of Duty 3 is coming out in November, so whatever.
2383820	2388120	It's a good game, though, definitely worth the multiplayer, so check it out.
2388120	2393480	Some other fun news, Nintendo, there was a whole controversy about the Wii using the
2393480	2394480	friend codes.
2394480	2396860	Well, they're going to make it a little bit easier on you.
2396860	2401560	They will be using the friend's code system, however, they are going to only require that
2401560	2403840	you have one friend code.
2403840	2408200	So you'll be able to share that friend code and then be friended for all the other games.
2408200	2412520	So that is good, you know, at least a good way to do that.
2412520	2416020	I swear I had that in the show role, that's crazy, my bad.
2416020	2419180	And then there's some other stuff.
2419180	2424960	There was actually legislation that's in the house right now to require the ESRB to actually
2424960	2428980	play through the entire game before reviewing them.
2428980	2433320	So that's kind of interesting, I don't think it's going to work because, you know, that
2433320	2434320	would take forever.
2434320	2435720	It would seriously delay the release of all the games.
2435720	2439640	It would delay games and how would you do, like, MMOs or games that have new content
2439640	2441640	added to them constantly.
2441640	2442760	I don't think it's going to work.
2442760	2443760	It's unrealistic.
2443760	2447680	And why are they having, why is the government concerning themselves with this kind of stuff
2447680	2449680	anyways?
2449680	2454680	What I think should be is that I think that on the websites there should be a parent link
2454680	2462120	for any internet savvy parent to go online, get content warnings of the games more in
2462120	2463120	depth.
2463120	2469000	I think the manufacturer does have a degree of responsibility to make sure that they give
2469000	2473680	accurate listings, but if they're really so concerned about it, then they can make it
2473680	2477520	a requirement for the manufacturers to have more information made available.
2477520	2480960	Or you know how, like, when you buy food it says for nutritional content, write in to
2480960	2483520	this address or go on this website?
2483520	2485680	I think it should be the same thing.
2485680	2491200	However, I think that it really is up to the parent to do the research before allowing
2491200	2492800	their child to buy the game.
2492800	2498240	As far as children, though, buying the games without their parent's permission, oh well.
2498240	2500520	Some other fun stuff.
2500520	2506800	Rockstar announced a brand new series this week actually called L.A. Noire and more information
2506800	2512240	should be coming out when the official trailer is released on October 5th, and if you want
2512240	2519400	more information on that, you can visit rockstargames.com slash L.A. Noire, that's L-A-N-O-I-R-E.
2519400	2522880	And looks like it's going to be a game that, of course, you know, kind of pays tribute
2522880	2530120	to a lot of the film noir movies, much like, you know, say L.A. Confidential or even if
2530120	2533520	you want to go really old, The Maltese Falcon.
2533520	2538100	So that should be pretty cool, kind of Grand Theft Auto-ish.
2538100	2539660	So I'm looking forward to that.
2539660	2542760	And then finally, some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.
2542760	2547200	As we mentioned before, Sierra's planning on releasing some games to Xbox Live Arcade.
2547200	2548200	The first...
2548200	2549200	King's Quest?
2549200	2550200	King's Quest?
2550200	2551200	King's Quest?
2551200	2552200	King's Quest?
2552200	2554200	There's a couple of games that were announced.
2554200	2560160	Assault Heroes, which is going to be another over-the-head kind of shooter game that, you
2560160	2565880	know, using two analog sticks, think, you know, Geometry Wars, but still pretty cool.
2565880	2571080	Then my favorite game, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, and that
2571080	2572560	was a really fun mini golf game.
2572560	2574320	I used to piss off people with that.
2574320	2579360	And then, of course, Codemasters also announced the X06 Sensible Soccer, which I think was
2579360	2582480	announced even before that.
2582480	2587240	And of course, a very classic game should be MacKenzie Way.
2587240	2589600	I wanted to go to the chat room for some comments here.
2589600	2594480	DNL, who by the way, posted some great artwork to our Live Journal community this week.
2594480	2597440	Check it out if you're a user of Live Journal or Community Orange Lounge on there.
2597440	2603320	DNL says, in regards to the ESRB thing, on the back of the package, it does say ESRB
2603320	2606080	content rating, www.esrb.org.
2606080	2609480	And also something I wanted to add on that whole ESRB thing is that when you play a game
2609480	2613900	online, you always do get that, you know, warning that comes up, warning, game experience
2613900	2618880	may change with online play, doo-doo-doo type thing, so something to think about.
2618880	2622840	All right, I finally have some results for you guys.
2622840	2623840	You ready?
2623840	2626520	My God, that was a lot of work.
2626520	2631340	All right, here it is, the definitive list, games we would like to see South Park make
2631340	2632340	fun of next.
2632340	2636960	And I got to tell you, this list turned out really freaking weird, considering we had
2636960	2639700	so many votes, there were a lot of ties.
2639700	2647120	So here it is, the number one game you want to see South Park make fun of was a tie.
2647120	2654360	Game number one, Silent Hill, and game number two, Katamari Damacy, those games tied for
2654360	2655360	first place.
2655360	2656360	Damacy.
2656360	2657360	Whatever.
2657360	2663680	And now what's interesting is so that takes us to third place, and there was also a tie.
2663680	2667240	So we have two games tied for third place, because you know, you have first and second
2667240	2668440	place basically tied there.
2668440	2674800	So for third place, we have Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and Final Fantasy are the two
2674800	2677560	games that came in third place there.
2677560	2678920	So that is the definitive list.
2678920	2683480	Thank you guys all for voting and giving me a lot of work there during that segment.
2683480	2684480	Yikes.
2684480	2688360	Well, we'll see if any of those actually make it to the show.
2688360	2690640	And then you can say you heard it here first.
2690640	2694320	Let's go to the Skype line, boys and girls, and take some calls.
2694320	2696640	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2696640	2697640	Who's this?
2697640	2698640	Raven's Dolphin.
2698640	2699640	Hi, my friend.
2699640	2701280	What's on your mind?
2701280	2704320	I just want to say one news, Ryan.
2704320	2705320	Yeah?
2705320	2708920	It's Gamefly.
2708920	2712080	They actually did some more things with Gamefly.
2712080	2715120	They now have four tiers now.
2715120	2716120	Four tiers?
2716120	2717120	Yeah.
2717120	2723140	Now you can get one game for $15.99, you can get two games for $21, you can get now, they
2723140	2729560	just added this, three games for $30, or you can go for the Kitten Kaboodle, which you'll
2729560	2734000	lock yourself in your room forever, four games for $40.
2734000	2736480	Netflix does like eight.
2736480	2738720	You can do like up to eight movies on Netflix.
2738720	2743100	So at least I think you can, so I'm not too surprised.
2743100	2746160	They probably would let you do more if you really want, but damn, what do you need with
2746160	2747160	five games at a time?
2747160	2749440	What do you need with four games at a time?
2749440	2753960	Two is enough so that you have, well, one's really enough, but two is enough so that when
2753960	2756740	one's in the mail, you still have something to play.
2756740	2757740	That's right.
2757740	2761640	So they don't need more than that in my opinion, but whatever.
2761640	2763280	It's your money, spend it how you want.
2763280	2766360	Yeah, because I'm poor, I have to save up for a week.
2766360	2767560	Are you a Gamefly subscriber?
2767560	2768560	Yes, I am.
2768560	2769560	I don't use them.
2769560	2770560	What do you think of them?
2770560	2773120	I mean, it's not because I dislike them or anything, I just at this time choose not to
2773120	2774120	use them.
2774120	2775120	What do you think of them?
2775120	2777840	Actually, they got really better.
2777840	2783160	Before at first, they didn't ship my games for like nine days, and now it's coming in
2783160	2784720	four.
2784720	2788160	Black Wolf in our chat room is commenting, you just had to be a member for a month before
2788160	2789780	you got the third game option.
2789780	2791600	They had three games from Gamefly years ago.
2791600	2793440	The four games is new.
2793440	2797240	Well, they just gave it to me for 25 cents this month, Black Wolf.
2797240	2798240	I'm sorry.
2798240	2800200	I guess they're not nice to me.
2800200	2801200	All right.
2801200	2804320	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
2804320	2807760	Yeah, one other thing.
2807760	2810760	What is it?
2810760	2811760	What was it?
2811760	2812760	Oh, I know.
2812760	2813760	I know.
2813760	2815960	I just bought an iPod, so I'm now mad at Apple.
2815960	2817120	Why?
2817120	2822000	Because they just came out with the new Nanos, and it looks like a little mini iPod.
2822000	2825000	Remember the ones with the black and white screen thing, the iPod mini?
2825000	2826000	Yeah.
2826000	2828960	Well, I got an old Nano, so I'm now mad at them.
2828960	2829960	You might.
2829960	2833220	Well, I doubt you could do it, because sometimes if they do a price cut, like a week after
2833220	2839680	you bought it, they'll give you a refund, but maybe not with the old models versus new
2839680	2840680	models.
2840680	2841680	You never know.
2841680	2842680	Check their website.
2842680	2843680	I don't know.
2843680	2844680	Couldn't tell you.
2844680	2845680	Yeah.
2845680	2846680	Yeah.
2846680	2847680	That's about it.
2847680	2848680	All right, Ravenstaufen.
2848680	2849680	Well, thanks so much for your call.
2849680	2851920	We'll talk to you again soon, all right?
2851920	2852920	You bet.
2852920	2853920	All right.
2853920	2854920	Later.
2854920	2855920	All right.
2855920	2856920	Let's go to another call.
2856920	2857920	We're getting a lot of calls tonight.
2857920	2858920	Hopefully, we get to everybody.
2858920	2859920	Hi.
2859920	2860920	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2860920	2861920	Who's this?
2861920	2862920	Hi.
2862920	2863920	Can you guys hear me?
2863920	2864920	Yes, we can hear you.
2864920	2865920	Who's this?
2865920	2866920	Oh, hi.
2866920	2867920	This is Blue Monster from the chat room.
2867920	2868920	Hi.
2868920	2869920	What's on your mind?
2869920	2870920	Hello.
2870920	2871920	Hi.
2871920	2872920	I just wanted to share two things.
2872920	2875880	The first one is congrats on the show, man, because seriously, it's something I look forward
2875880	2876880	to every week.
2876880	2877880	Thank you.
2877880	2878880	I really appreciate that.
2878880	2882520	A constant in your life, as I was telling you earlier to Dark Sakura.
2882520	2887280	Anyways, the second little thing I want to share with you guys is I've picked up Okami
2887280	2888280	last week.
2888280	2892240	Yes, that's a game I've heard a lot of great things about and seen a lot of good things
2892240	2893240	about.
2893240	2896600	I'm a little tight on my gaming budget right now, so I haven't been able to pick it up,
2896600	2897600	but yeah, I'm really curious.
2897600	2899480	What do you think of this game?
2899480	2900480	That's what I actually wanted to call.
2900480	2904600	I wanted to give you a mini review kind of thing.
2904600	2905600	It's a pretty good game.
2905600	2906600	It's a pretty good game.
2906600	2912060	It's very solid-ish, but the only thing I have against it is there's a lot of hand-holding.
2912060	2915040	The first dozen hours, I put over 24 in it.
2915040	2917040	The first 12 hours, it's like nothing but hand-holding.
2917040	2919880	They tell you everything, the way you've got to stop it.
2919880	2925440	So if you're looking for some hardcore, solid-ish style of gameplay, you'll have a hard time
2925440	2929320	getting through it, at least for the first half.
2929320	2934640	Enchanted Arms, which is a game I have been playing lately, is very similar because every
2934640	2938480	time you go into a new dungeon, it seems like there's some new environmental thing, like
2938480	2940840	press A to get into the cart.
2940840	2943920	Press A to move the teleporter, and they'll have to have this whole back and forth where
2943920	2945640	the main character is like, how do I do this?
2945640	2948640	And one of the other smarter people in the party says, well, you walk up to it and press
2948640	2951440	A. But that's the answer every single time.
2951440	2954760	You walk up to it and press A. They could have just said it in the beginning.
2954760	2956760	They could have just said it in the beginning.
2956760	2961000	They have a little tune that's jumping up and down the nose of the wolf, and he tells
2961000	2965340	you all the time, oh, maybe I should use my brush to cut this vine, which I've been doing
2965340	2969240	for the past six hours, please don't do it myself.
2969240	2972900	Maybe you should just have had a thing that says, hey, whenever you see new shit, press
2972900	2973900	A.
2973900	2974900	Yeah.
2974900	2978400	But overall, it's really good music, really good art style.
2978400	2979680	The graphics are really good.
2979680	2984160	There is a bit of slowdown because there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen sometimes.
2984160	2985960	But overall, it's a really good game.
2985960	2990320	It seems long because I've already put 24 hours in it, and the game actually just got
2990320	2991320	started.
2991320	2996240	And the hand-holding just now stopped, so I'm guessing it's going to be a long game.
2996240	2999760	So it's a good game to get if you're waiting for Pilot Princess, I guess.
2999760	3000760	Awesome.
3000760	3001760	Now, one other question I have for you.
3001760	3005240	For those that don't know much about Okami, maybe we've seen the graphics that has that
3005240	3008920	very unique hand-drawn style to it.
3008920	3010440	What would you compare this game to?
3010440	3014180	If you could compare it to any other game, maybe half this and half this, what would
3014180	3016960	you say it's kind of like for people that want to know if they'd be interested in this
3016960	3017960	or not?
3017960	3023860	It makes the world of Wind Waker and the style, cartoony style of Wind Waker, but also add
3023860	3028440	a bit of a stench of Chester Radio or Chester Radio Future, and maybe some beautiful Joe
3028440	3029440	in it.
3029440	3030440	Interesting.
3030440	3031440	Interesting.
3031440	3035000	And all those games kind of have that same art style, too, so that's kind of interesting.
3035000	3040760	The thing is that Wind Waker is very clean-looking, this is more dirty.
3040760	3044760	The graphics are not that clean because of the brush thing and the whole brush theme
3044760	3045760	that it has.
3045760	3047760	So it's more beautiful Joe-ish.
3047760	3048760	It's still really good.
3048760	3052360	It's very Japanese, so you've got to be open-minded about it.
3052360	3055680	It's still a really good game, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes
3055680	3056880	that kind of game.
3056880	3061680	And don't be scared, it's not as platformer as it seems to be.
3061680	3064040	It's more adventure-ish and more pilot-ish, I guess.
3064040	3065040	All right.
3065040	3066040	Very cool.
3066040	3067040	Now, hey, I have one more question for you.
3067040	3068440	You're calling us from Argentina, right?
3068440	3069440	I'm calling from Argentina.
3069440	3071120	It's 1 a.m. in the morning over here.
3071120	3072120	Awesome.
3072120	3073120	Oh, my gosh.
3073120	3074120	Wow, you're hardcore.
3074120	3076100	I do have one quick question for you, though.
3076100	3078040	How much do you pay for games in your country?
3078040	3081320	Because we know that, you know, we hear a lot about the UK and how they're having to
3081320	3085000	pay higher prices, and across the board, a lot of other countries have to pay higher
3085000	3086000	prices.
3086000	3087000	What's it like in Argentina?
3087000	3089120	Well, here's the thing.
3089120	3093440	You pay about 80 U.S. dollars for a game in between 70 or 80, if you want the original
3093440	3096920	copy, of course, because there's a black market here, like, you wouldn't believe, like, you
3096920	3099600	can buy a game for two bucks if you want to, U.S.
3099600	3100600	Wow.
3100600	3106200	But, yeah, but if you actually want an original game, you've got a pony of about 70 pay bucks,
3106200	3109520	and it's all games because you don't get the new stuff right away, and you've got to take
3109520	3116200	into account that a maid here, like a maid full-time maid here, maybe cost 200 U.S. dollars
3116200	3117200	a month.
3117200	3118200	Wow.
3118200	3119200	Wow.
3119200	3124080	So, you know, I know, so it's like, basically, a game is about half the salary of a maid
3124080	3125080	for a month.
3125080	3126080	Gosh.
3126080	3129080	Well, hey, now, your copy of Okami is legit, though, right?
3129080	3130080	Not really.
3130080	3131080	Uh-oh.
3131080	3132080	Uh-oh.
3132080	3135080	Well, we better hurry and end this call.
3135080	3136900	We won't tell on you.
3136900	3137900	We won't.
3137900	3138900	We won't.
3138900	3139900	We won't.
3139900	3140900	We won't give out your full name or anything.
3140900	3141900	I'm glad you got to call in, though.
3141900	3142900	Yeah.
3142900	3143900	Yeah.
3143900	3144900	I'm glad I called on you.
3144900	3145900	All right.
3145900	3146900	It was fun.
3146900	3147900	It was really good.
3147900	3150040	Well, have fun with the game, and we know that when you can't afford it, you will buy
3150040	3151600	the legit copy.
3151600	3153680	I already pre-opted this, so, you know.
3153680	3154680	Oh, good.
3154680	3155680	Good.
3155680	3156680	Okay.
3156680	3157680	All right.
3157680	3158680	Happy ending.
3158680	3159680	All right.
3159680	3160680	Take care, buddy.
3160680	3161680	Thanks for calling.
3161680	3162680	See you.
3162680	3163680	Bye.
3163680	3164680	That's great.
3164680	3165680	We love hearing from people.
3165680	3169560	We love hearing from employees, but over-plan it because, you know, you're all the way down
3169560	3170560	there right now.
3170560	3171560	I just got to keep looking south.
3171560	3172560	Oh, my God.
3172560	3173920	SSJ-100, Matt's going happy ending.
3173920	3178800	The thing is, is that I'm in massage therapy school, so I know what you mean, so just don't
3178800	3179800	put it.
3179800	3180800	Oh, God.
3180800	3181800	You guys, go play Uno.
3181800	3183080	They cover that in massage therapy school?
3183080	3184080	No, they don't.
3184080	3185400	I haven't started school yet, though.
3185400	3187080	Go play Uno, you sick fucks.
3187080	3188080	All right.
3188080	3189080	Hi, here on Orange Launch Radio.
3189080	3190080	Who's this?
3190080	3191080	Hi.
3191080	3192080	This is Eddie.
3192080	3193080	Hi, Eddie.
3193080	3194080	What's on your mind, buddy?
3194080	3195080	Yeah.
3195080	3199400	I just heard you heard about that thing, like a guy posted on the All Games forums that
3199400	3205240	like he was booted out of Uno because somebody saw that he was a black guy.
3205240	3207380	I did read that post, isn't it?
3207380	3208480	That is so fucked up.
3208480	3209800	I did read that post.
3209800	3212080	Yeah, somebody, oh, oh, that sucks.
3212080	3213680	I don't think I know about this.
3213680	3214680	You know what?
3214680	3215680	Oh, no.
3215680	3219600	God, can we find the post real quick?
3219600	3222160	This just made me so angry.
3222160	3223440	Some people are so stupid.
3223440	3225440	I swear to God.
3225440	3226440	Let's see if I can find it.
3226440	3229040	Do you remember what forum it was in?
3229040	3233000	It was the... Let me ask you real quick, while I hunt for
3233000	3237920	the post, is there any other topics you want to bring up tonight?
3237920	3240440	I had something related to that thing.
3240440	3249040	One of the replies to the article was that that's why the me on the we thing is so good
3249040	3252200	because you can create your own avatar or whatever.
3252200	3258240	I was just thinking that it doesn't really solve the racism issue since if the only way
3258240	3264440	to play a game is to create an avatar that is not black, then it's not really a representation
3264440	3267720	of yourself if you are black, right?
3267720	3268720	Yeah.
3268720	3272520	But, it shouldn't matter.
3272520	3273520	It shouldn't matter at all.
3273520	3278040	I mean, in World of Warcraft, we play purple and green people and it doesn't matter, you
3278040	3279040	know?
3279040	3280040	Yeah, yeah.
3280040	3284080	And then, you know, when they demoed the we, they showed them making Samuel L. Jackson
3284080	3286960	the baddest motherfucker on the planet, you know?
3286960	3291540	I would cower in fear if I was playing against Samuel L. Jackson, you know, because he's
3291540	3292540	a badass.
3292540	3295160	But, man, this is... Wow, people are just so superficial.
3295160	3297120	Anyway, I found the post.
3297120	3298120	Here it is.
3298120	3301200	I realized probably like 50 of you linked it in chat room, but I did find it on my own.
3301200	3302200	Thank you very much.
3302200	3303200	Here it is.
3303200	3304200	This was made by a post.
3304200	3309080	The guy is named Five Fingers of Death and this is on allgames.com's forums in the Xbox
3309080	3310080	360 section.
3310080	3312800	Does vision cam hamper jump in vision of live?
3312800	3314880	I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this.
3314880	3318640	I purchased my vision cam last week and hooked it up to experience a couple of multiplayer
3318640	3319720	UNO sessions.
3319720	3322760	When I connected, all three people I was paired with also had the camera.
3322760	3328580	I heard someone mention, he's a black guy, and then I was booted by the host.
3328580	3331560	As we know, live has always had its racist comments, but for the most part, you could
3331560	3333520	never really tell who you were gaming with.
3333520	3336380	For all we know, David Duke could be playing with Louis Farrakhan and neither would be
3336380	3337380	the wiser.
3337380	3340880	Now, being able to actually see the person, how will this affect the live community?
3340880	3341880	Just wondering.
3341880	3346000	Oh, I can't wait for me to get on the camera and have somebody go, that guy looks like
3346000	3348620	a fag, boot him.
3348620	3350640	You wouldn't want to play with those fuckers anyway.
3350640	3357280	I mean, it's fucked up, it's stupid, put all those people on your ban list and warn them
3357280	3359800	and damage them the best you can.
3359800	3362280	So stupid.
3362280	3365840	They obviously don't want to play a good game, good old fashioned game of UNO anyway.
3365840	3372300	I mean, it doesn't make it right at all, by any means does it make it right, but I guess
3372300	3377760	until Microsoft steps in, I don't even know what Microsoft can do.
3377760	3380360	What can they do?
3380360	3386800	So it's up to the community, the police itself, I suppose, I don't know, disturbing.
3386800	3389720	Anything else you want to say on that?
3389720	3394640	Well not on that issue, but take pictures of Cookie Box.
3394640	3395640	I will.
3395640	3396640	I will.
3396640	3399640	So you can get them from Granville Island, one of my favorite places in Vancouver.
3399640	3400640	I appreciate it.
3400640	3401640	Yep.
3401640	3402640	All right, have a good one, buddy.
3402640	3403640	All right, you too.
3403640	3404640	Later.
3404640	3405640	Bye.
3405640	3406640	Bye.
3406640	3407640	Let's go to one more call.
3407640	3408640	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3408640	3409640	Who's this?
3409640	3410640	It's Ron.
3410640	3411640	Hi, guys.
3411640	3412640	Hi, Jamie.
3412640	3413640	Hello.
3413640	3414640	You always get through every week, Rama.
3414640	3415640	How do you manage it?
3415640	3416640	I did it through last week.
3416640	3417640	Well, you were here last week, right?
3417640	3419640	I made it in the last segment of the show.
3419640	3420640	That's right, that's right.
3420640	3421960	Oh, what's up, my friend?
3421960	3422960	Not much.
3422960	3423960	There's a couple of things I want to tell you about.
3423960	3425680	Here's a little known fact.
3425680	3429680	Mr. Rogers was a sniper in the Marine Corps.
3429680	3431000	Isn't that an urban legend?
3431000	3432000	No.
3432000	3436040	When I was training with the Marines, they were showing us the tapes of famous Marines
3436040	3437040	on the tape.
3437040	3438040	What's it?
3438040	3439040	Wow.
3439040	3440040	Okay.
3440040	3443400	Well, you know, I'm not going to say you're a liar.
3443400	3444800	I just always thought that was an urban legend.
3444800	3445800	I didn't think that was true.
3445800	3448440	That was the first time I ever heard it when I saw the tape.
3448440	3449440	All right.
3449440	3452400	Actually, I think I remember my brother telling me something about that.
3452400	3456080	Well, me and my brother actually just was released from the Marines.
3456080	3459280	Fireboma says, WTF, Mr. Rogers is a camper.
3459280	3462920	Well, explain why you're so calm and quiet on the show, you know?
3462920	3463920	Seriously, that's kind of scary.
3463920	3464920	You have to have insane nerves.
3464920	3465920	I'm going to Wikipedia.
3465920	3466920	I'm going to Wikipedia right now.
3466920	3475240	You heard about the girl, the young lady that they passed through sniper school who was,
3475240	3482760	I want to say, an Air Force reservist because they can actually take combat.
3482760	3484320	Okay.
3484320	3485320	You know what?
3485320	3487680	On Wikipedia, that whole thing is filed under urban legends.
3487680	3488680	Here's what it says.
3488680	3492040	Fred Rogers has been the subject of a few urban legends, among them ideas that he served
3492040	3496040	in the military around the era of the Vietnam War, was a sniper, was a Navy Seal, or had
3496040	3497040	a drug problem.
3497040	3500840	Rumors to this effect are discounted as being false on urban legend websites.
3500840	3504960	Not only is military service not mentioned on any biographies about him, but there wasn't
3504960	3508240	a period of time unaccounted for when he could have been involved in such.
3508240	3509240	Yikes.
3509240	3510240	Maybe that's it.
3510240	3512240	I need to give you Wikipedia to your friend.
3512240	3516680	But he also was a Presbyterian minister and left the clergy to work with children.
3516680	3517680	That's true.
3517680	3518680	All right.
3518680	3523140	Anyway, I just realized podcast listeners may not understand why we're suddenly talking
3523140	3524420	about Mr. Rogers.
3524420	3528080	We do a bonus segment when we tape live when we'll sometimes play things off of YouTube
3528080	3531080	and such, and that was the subject this week was Mr. Rogers.
3531080	3535080	So sorry, just for the podcast people's sake who maybe didn't hear that live.
3535080	3537280	Anyway, anything else on your mind, Rama?
3537280	3539960	I've decided not to buy a PlayStation 3.
3539960	3540960	Why is this?
3540960	3547760	I was watching, I was following like the Sony's podcast, live cast of the PS3 and everything.
3547760	3549840	Now they're doing their version of Virtual Console.
3549840	3552720	On that fact alone, I refuse to buy one.
3552720	3557440	Well okay, but is it because you feel they're ripping them off or something?
3557440	3558440	Yeah.
3558440	3563120	They say imitation is the greatest form for flattery, but come on, Sony's been ripping
3563120	3565080	off people left and right with the PS3.
3565080	3568480	But couldn't you say that the Virtual Console is a form of Xbox Live Arcade?
3568480	3575600	Yes and no, but the thing is the Virtual Console has all these classic games by Nintendo, whereas
3575600	3578960	Xbox Live Arcade is like all these other arcade classic games in a way.
3578960	3579960	Not totally though.
3579960	3580960	It's not all Nintendo.
3580960	3581960	It's like the shade of gray.
3581960	3582960	Hold on, it's not all Nintendo.
3582960	3586400	Sega's on board and Sega is supposedly going to be on board with the Xbox Live Arcade as
3586400	3590740	well in those Sonic the Hedgehog teasers we saw previously.
3590740	3595520	So remember that Virtual Console also has, you know, Turbo Grafx-16 and possibly Commodore
3595520	3596520	64 as well.
3596520	3600400	True, but I just find it funny after Nintendo said they're doing this, Sony's like, oh,
3600400	3602040	we're going to do it too.
3602040	3608880	Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know, but to not buy a system over it, I mean, what if they
3608880	3609880	did it better?
3609880	3613880	Eh, I just can't see myself, you know.
3613880	3618440	And no, Zuko, I'm not a fanboy, I just don't have 600 bucks.
3618440	3622360	There's the realistic reason why none of us are getting a PS3 at launch, at least I think
3622360	3623360	I can speak.
3623360	3626720	Well, I don't know, I guess Jamie's getting one, but I know I can't afford 600 bucks.
3626720	3629000	For 600 bucks, it better come with a lap dance.
3629000	3633600	For 600 bucks, it better suck, never mind, I'm not going to finish that thought.
3633600	3634600	Yeah, okay.
3634600	3635600	You know what I'm thinking.
3635600	3637600	You know what I'm thinking.
3637600	3640400	All right, anything else on your mind, Rama?
3640400	3642680	That's it, I love you guys.
3642680	3643680	Love you too.
3643680	3644680	Bye.
3644680	3645680	See you next month.
3645680	3646680	All right, bye.
3646680	3647680	Bye.
3647680	3652840	That's right, I'm coming to New York City very soon, and I'll have details on where
3652840	3655360	I'm going to be and when, hopefully soon.
3655360	3658760	I feel weird because now I think there's at least more than a handful of people that want
3658760	3662600	to come meet up, so I feel weird about doing that at a store like Unannounced, so I'm trying
3662600	3665000	to figure something out, creative, we can do, we'll see.
3665000	3666800	I'll have to work with some people in New York.
3666800	3668720	That'll be fun, though.
3668720	3672600	Anyways, are there any other last minute stories that any of you guys have?
3672600	3676320	Thank you guys, by the way, all of you guys that called in tonight, and sorry to those
3676320	3677320	we didn't get to.
3677320	3682040	We're just running out low on time.
3682040	3683040	Not really.
3683040	3684040	All right.
3684040	3688600	I have one quick story I wanted to share here from BamaniStyle.com, has posted a list of
3688600	3695280	Elite Beat Agents, a song list, at least partial, well, yeah, again, because apparently it's
3695280	3699440	being shown off on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, and they were able to get some of the songs
3699440	3700840	from the game.
3700840	3706720	IMCA by Village People, Highway Star by Deep Purple, Rock This Town by Stray Cats, Walkie
3706720	3711840	Talkie Man by Stereogram, Makes No Difference by Sum 41, September by Earth Wind and Fire,
3711840	3715360	Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne, and I Was Born to Love You by Queen.
3715360	3716360	All right.
3716360	3721480	If you want to check out what stages those are related to, check out BamaniStyle.com.
3721480	3724840	There's a more complete list over there.
3724840	3729400	On that note, I guess we're going to end the show, so let's go around and get everybody's
3729400	3730400	final thought.
3730400	3732280	Loki, your final thought?
3732280	3733920	I don't know.
3733920	3736880	I ran out of milkshake.
3736880	3738720	I'm sorry to hear that.
3738720	3743880	My final thought would be I need to adjust the sound on my new TV because it sounds like
3743880	3747680	I'm playing Beatmania in a tin can, and that's not fun.
3747680	3749000	DarkSakura, your final thought?
3749000	3753360	Reject false icons, and Julie's meeting us for dinner.
3753360	3754360	Sweet.
3754360	3755360	I need some dinner.
3755360	3757180	She has my house keys because she had to feed my cat.
3757180	3761560	I need some big-time dinner action, so to do that, we have to finish the show.
3761560	3762560	Good night, everybody.
3762560	3769560	Thank you so much for supporting independent internet radio, even when the hosts stutter.
3769560	3772320	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
3772320	3777520	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
