487	5551	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5891	14718	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15459	19142	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20463	25067	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 202 for this October the 1st of 2006.
28359	30942	I can't believe the year is almost over at this point.
31122	31602	It's crazy.
32183	32583	Seriously.
32683	33705	Time just flies by.
34205	36127	Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news.
36247	37228	Loki, why don't you start us off?
37448	41412	Yes, let's start us off with the Zune.
41913	43254	The Zune, it sounds like loon.
43495	49961	But anyways, Microsoft's brand new MP3 movie, you name it, player.
51297	55739	They announced some details at XO6 about how exactly it's going to work and some of the online things.
56220	63743	The 30GB version of the Zune will be sold for $249.99 when they're on sale November 14th in the United States.
64244	67385	It says the price of music is in two choices.
67685	74449	You can either buy a monthly pass for $0.99, which will give you hearing access to all the songs in the Zune marketplace.
75970	76730	But there is a catch.
76890	79732	You will not be able to listen to the songs once the...
82352	88574	If you want to permanently buy any song, you can make it yours by spending 79 Microsoft points.
88614	94756	That's right, the same Microsoft points you would be buying Doom on Xbox Live Arcade you can be spending on music.
94936	98697	And of course, 79 points is roughly about 99 cents.
99278	105340	So you can either purchase the song for 99 cents, or you can pay, I guess, a monthly fee and listen to all the music for 99 cents.
106180	107460	But you probably have to download it each time.
107941	109061	So, it's kind of interesting.
109793	111013	Debit and all that stuff were practically there.
133018	133679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
152425	156288	One of the technologies they were showing off was a thumbprint scanner.
156388	165273	It's basically a thumbprint scanner, and then you enter in your phone number, and you'll deduct money from your checking or savings account just using your thumbprint.
165793	167614	So that's pretty much going to be like the wave of the future.
168155	179882	They also have this thing where they have a chip stored in a fake tooth that's fireproof, you know, bashproof pretty much, so that if you were to be horribly, say, horribly burned...
180430	183392	In a fire, they can still identify your remains without DNA testing.
183412	186814	You've got your tooth there with your medical records and all your information.
187054	189836	Without having to play, let's name the burn victim!
190937	192838	Well, to get back into gaming news.
192878	193959	Yes, please.
194039	197041	Keep in mind, I was a big tech TV fangirl.
197641	202945	For fans of Saints Row, there is a thing called the Thunky Fresh Pack.
203485	203765	Yeah.
204266	208949	It's 100 Microsoft points, and it has clothes, tattoos, hairstyles...
209928	220816	For use in single and multiplayer modes, you've also got tiger-striped underwear, bunny slippers, an eye patch, and a samurai helmet, medallions, and rattlesnake tattoos.
222297	227641	Gee, do I spend the 100 points to buy this crap, or should I get a copy of London Bridge for my Zune?
227781	228761	I just don't know.
230102	233465	I think, uh... Some people like the customization.
233565	235126	And some people like Fergie.
235166	235266	Yeah.
236381	239662	Oh my god, I had to listen to that CD yesterday.
239682	243202	I characterize it as a pimp hat now, and it's dressed in really nice clothes.
243542	252344	All purple, of course, because I've got to represent things for all colors in order to get the more, you know, I guess, points, you know, for missions and stuff.
253144	262246	But, um, I don't know, this was kind of like the same thing we were talking about, you know, a while back, which was rumored to be coming to the kiosk at GameStop for free, uh,
263749	264569	Robotron 2084 Microsoft Points
290013	294977	on Xbox 360, Satan's Hollow, Sinistar, Spy Hunter, and Tapper.
295638	298921	Yes, you can play those all online on Midway's website.
299041	301083	Right now, if you want, it's midwayarcade.com.
301724	303585	So, who needs Midway Arcade Treasures, huh?
303725	304846	You got all that available for you.
305247	305527	Enjoy.
305547	306128	Exactly.
306828	307369	And you know what?
308430	311312	You gotta save money for those PlayStation 3 games, of course.
311472	312513	And as we mentioned earlier...
313749	318512	They are going to be retailing for about $59.99 for the most part, which is expected.
318812	333420	Most current-gen games are peaking at about $49.99, most actually which are $39.99 now, and now the next-gen games are going to try to be getting $59.99 retail for most everything.
334100	342065	This is pretty much confirmed by, say, sites like SonyStyle and whatnot.
343388	347231	Some games might not be $59.99 like Gran Turismo HD.
350172	352673	It's not a surprise, I would say.
352934	357896	I'm still waiting for those companies out there to get greedy and start charging more.
357916	360478	As long as those $70 and $80 rumors don't come true.
360558	361998	To be honest, I don't think they are.
362339	367722	If anything, they'll try to nickel and dime you on the back end with their online content.
367822	368942	That's what it's going to end up being.
369843	370283	Instead of
371170	376695	Charging $70, they can charge $900 and charge $50 for the game or something.
377615	377936	Jamie.
378796	379057	What?
379137	379397	Jamie.
379637	379817	What?
379877	380138	Jamie.
380558	380838	Jamie.
381238	381459	Jamie.
381719	382179	Jamie.
382199	382640	Jamie.
382680	382880	Jamie.
383000	383340	Jamie.
383360	383620	Jamie.
383640	383841	Jamie.
383881	384721	Jamie.
384801	385822	I win.
387223	387684	Release dates.
389465	390866	UK release dates.
393488	394689	That was the ferret translating.
395110	395190	Okay.
395210	395310	Okay.
396279	402243	Coming out on 1st October, VeggieTales, Larry Boy and the Bad Apple on Game Boy Advance and PlayStation 2.
403484	407587	On the 6th, we have Barnyard for a bunch of stuff.
407987	419835	We have Capcom Puzzle World on PSP, Heroes of Annihilated Empires on the PC, Import Tuner Challenge on Xbox 360, Mage Knight Apocalypse on PC, the Nintendo DS browser on the PSP.
421216	421996	I'm sorry, the DS.
423598	424198	That was a bad joke.
427923	429964	Open Season coming out on damn near everything.
431445	432325	Put out by Ubisoft.
432825	434746	Wild Arms 4 on PlayStation 2.
435186	437387	I have to say the Wild Arms series is a good game.
437508	440849	I have a friend who's absolutely addicted to that game, so Wild Arms 4 is good.
442770	446452	Did Wild Arms Ultra F ever come out over there?
446572	447352	Not a series I played.
447872	449773	Hey guys, let me know if it ever came out.
450874	454896	A few things coming up though in the months to look forward to is Power Stone Collection for PSP.
456697	459160	English Training, Have Fun Improving Your Skills on the DS.
459580	460501	That's actually pretty funny.
461542	465365	And Resident Evil 4 Platinum, Sims 2 Pets coming out.
466627	472352	They're getting Dragon Ball Z, Tenkaichi Budokai 2, and Metal Slug Anthology.
473052	476015	It's pretty cool.
476856	478898	The US isn't going to see too much this week.
479498	481280	There are some pretty good games there.
481667	485869	FIFA Soccer 07, if you're a soccer fan, coming out in almost every single system.
486849	490311	You do have also Star Trek Encounters coming out in the PlayStation 2.
490811	493452	A great Star Trek combat game.
493952	495933	Very cheap.
495953	495933	$19.99.
496333	498334	So, check it out if you can.
498815	501096	I think, actually, it might even be $14.99.
501696	503216	I know it's very cheap, but that's all I know.
503977	508919	Anyways, another crappy game, Snowcross 2, featuring Air Blur Morgan.
509606	512947	and, by the way, this game has been delayed for a year, so it's crap.
515147	523669	Let's see, Mercury Meltdown for the PSP, which, you know, sequel for the first Mercury game, and I don't know if this is worth your money, but if you want, pick it up.
524029	526769	Gangs of London, definitely a better game for the PSP.
528030	534231	Also, on the PC, we have El Matador and Paparazzi.
535376	536517	So, that's some interesting stuff.
536737	540560	And, how could I not forget, Scarface, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
541461	547366	Now, a lot of places are reporting that this is the 8th of October, but it's actually the 5th.
547426	553191	It has a soft street date on it, so stores will be getting it on the 5th, but they cannot advertise it until the 8th.
553631	554572	So, weird.
555212	558615	Go bug your GameStops, because that's probably the game you're going to want that week.
560208	563391	Alright, well, over in Japan, we have some release dates for the week.
563471	565272	Honestly, not a whole lot coming out this week.
565312	566733	It's kind of a slow week over there as well.
568515	572778	NBA Live 07 and FIFA Soccer 07, both coming out this week.
574760	580385	Shinobido Imashime, also known as Spike the Best, is coming out over there this week as well.
581225	584348	And Dragon Ball Z Sparking Neo is coming out this week.
584969	589112	Front Mission 5 in the Ultimate Hits Collection hit stores this week in Japan as well.
589531	597215	And for you music game fans who have about $250 to spare, you can get your Guitar Freaks ASC arcade-style controller this week.
598936	599457	That's awesome.
600938	610483	Well, as far as other releases for the UK going back to them, they're actually for fans who are football fans.
611850	618174	There's Pro Evolution Soccer 6 coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC on 27th October.
618415	619475	Of course, not by Konami.
620276	622178	PSP and DS versions will be coming.
625260	633887	There are... They're actually stating that the 360 version is going to be noticeably improved.
634127	637750	The AI, anyway, is... There will be...
639375	644496	They actually specifically named it in areas like the AI players running into space.
644556	645436	That's not going to happen.
645816	647996	Also runs in high definition and widescreen.
648637	660799	It will also feature new licensed clubs including Manchester United, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, and Olympiasos.
661919	668400	New kits and squads for Czech, French, Australian, English, Italian, Argentinian teams.
669415	671076	Spanish and Swedish National.
672317	674878	So, I know we've got some football fans listening.
676119	676259	Goal!
678320	679040	Oh, it's so hot.
701735	702556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
724724	731886	You know, he's up for doing more 2D Castlevanias, so maybe we'll see some exclusive stuff on the next-gen marketplaces.
731906	733567	Please, some more 2D Castlevania.
733647	739949	Or just, even just some, you know, you can do that subtle hints of 3D, kind of like if you look at Symphony of the Night.
740269	744350	You know, just make a real grand 2D Castlevania for the next-gen.
744390	745431	I mean, it would be awesome.
745811	748632	Just because, you know, your next-gen doesn't mean everything has to be 3D.
749032	750192	Look at a game like Beautiful Joe.
750392	752453	It was a great 2D using next-gen graphics.
753153	753253	Hmm.
755202	759825	Anyway, if you still want to live in the current generation, well, this might be the controller for you.
760445	763727	This is a controller that would be great for throwing against the wall.
764227	773092	Everybody has a friend like this, somebody who gets so frustrated, or maybe a sibling, that they throw the controller against the wall, or they throw it at people when they get really frustrated with the game.
773492	776414	Well, now you have a Nerf controller.
777134	780036	That's right, there's a PlayStation 2 controller that's covered in Nerf,
780754	782255	It's like this bluish color here.
783036	785317	And it's coming out for the PlayStation 2.
786458	787319	And it's wireless.
787779	789760	It comes in black, blue, red, or orange.
789820	792562	It'll be about $30 and comes out in November of 2006.
792762	794724	That's right, the official Nerf controller.
794824	796465	Perfect for throwing around.
796505	797446	Although I wouldn't recommend it.
797486	798887	You could still break the damn thing.
799407	800468	Or somebody.
800948	802930	Yeah, it's still kind of heavy.
803110	805692	Just because it's Nerf made doesn't mean it's safe to chuck at people's heads.
806152	807593	But it at least would hurt a lot less.
808140	820423	Speaking about breaking people, there was the Uwe Boll boxing matches going on recently, and as expected, you know, nothing's going to be fair when it comes down to Uwe Boll.
820663	833327	In fact, actually, Richard Lotax Kanka was one of the people from Something Awful to actually be able to fight in this, and he kind of gave a little bit of a
834295	835356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
864429	866031	and Oogaball doesn't like a fair fight.
866691	876139	So, out of the four people, including one 17-year-old, everyone pretty much got beat the crap out of.
877340	877920	Is that legal?
878301	879862	To beat the crap out of a 17-year-old like that?
879882	880763	Well, I guess it was Canada.
880803	881643	Maybe the laws are different there.
881663	882024	I don't know.
883445	884626	I guess he signed a waiver.
884686	885987	Maybe the parents signed a waiver as well.
886007	887989	The video's out there on YouTube, so check it out.
888789	892432	To be honest, I don't know.
892993	893193	In the
893995	903708	Richard Lotex, his whole thing is he didn't really hate Uebol before this whole thing, and now he does.
903928	905750	He thinks he's a douche, basically.
907933	911117	Wonderdog Harold sums it up in our chatroom and says, Uebol is such a pig fucker.
911744	912204	It doesn't matter.
912384	912924	Okay, big deal.
912944	914025	So you beat up some critics.
914285	920287	Ooh, you beat up critics that had no boxing training, and then one person that actually might give you some competition.
920547	921928	You pussied out, you fucker.
922108	927830	Didn't one of the critics that came out of this say that, you know, although the fight was kind of a joke, the new movie's not bad?
927970	930351	Or something like the clips they saw from the new movie didn't seem that bad?
931211	933892	I don't see how they could mess up, you know, Postal.
933952	937373	I mean, it doesn't... That one I'm interested in seeing, actually.
937813	940014	But I think the new movie, in the name of the king or whatever...
940680	942041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
963990	966552	Oh God, Robway linked me this article.
966932	971214	He's aligning himself with the defense for some case.
971294	972855	It's just a bunch of bullshit.
972875	977157	Well, you'll notice I purposefully omitted that from tonight's show role because I didn't want to give him any more attention.
977317	977597	Sorry.
977878	984621	Well, the one thing that I think is worth mentioning for this is that it's probably something to likely get him disbarred in that state, so let's hope that happens.
984801	985141	Hooray.
985862	991865	Well, God, all this talk of Uwe Boll and Jack Thompson puts me in a foul mood, so you know what that means, right, DarkSakura?
1003525	1010151	FUs of the Week, DarkSakura My FU of the Week goes primarily, there are some exceptions, to straight men.
1012013	1023204	Oh yes, just because I'm a woman doesn't give you the right to look at me, see me there, and then proceed to back into me and elbow me in the shoulder while trying to take a picture at the wax museum.
1024247	1028730	and then it doesn't give you permission to just expect me to move out of the way when you're gonna open a door.
1028890	1029991	I paid to be there.
1030351	1032972	You are going to freaking respect my personal space.
1033172	1033693	Fuck you.
1034073	1034713	And your cock.
1036755	1037515	But not literally.
1037635	1037815	No.
1038256	1044719	It goes to this whole attitude of I'm a man, you're a woman, you have to move, you have to do what I say, blah blah blah.
1044820	1045360	Fuck you.
1045900	1048342	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
1049342	1049883	You know what?
1052024	1053565	The whole... I hate how...
1054930	1059054	I hope you're not... this isn't... Well, I'm just saying, how did you know his sexual orientation?
1059555	1060376	His wife was there.
1061217	1062178	Does that mean anything?
1062578	1063059	Trust me.
1064140	1066162	I have infallible gay darks.
1067323	1077013	These people... The only way that I think that there would be any remotely gay vibe coming from them is if they were like, you know, bare leather daddies or something.
1078554	1085539	All our listeners of the show are accepted from this, fuck you, right?
1085559	1087480	We're gonna drink beer and go to Hooters
1106294	1111817	We're gonna, to quote Margaret Cho, we're gonna order titties with ranch dressing and celery sticks.
1113778	1117740	That's just... Okay.
1117780	1118141	No, no, no.
1119061	1123263	And no, like I said, this is not centered toward all straight men.
1123303	1125705	This is just centered toward stupid straight men.
1125725	1131548	Alright, Loki, speaking of stupid straight men, Loki, you know they actually serve Hooters at Hooters?
1131988	1135290	That might be worth, you know, a price of admission right there, but their food's actually
1135882	1146710	Um, no, actually, ironically enough, fuck you, the stupid women drivers who can't fucking pay attention on the road because you're talking to your kids or talking on the cell phone or fucking around with something on your dash.
1147290	1160959	You know, I know I understand that those complex SUVs that you drive are so, you know, beyond you, but, you know, could you do us all a favor and stay at home so I don't have to bother, you know, driving behind you because you're too fucking slow or retarded?
1161320	1161680	Thank you.
1164124	1166185	You have to remember we have... Mail drivers are worse.
1166245	1169207	We have folks all around the world listening and not everyone knows what Hooters is.
1170347	1179052	Hooters is this eerie where you can order hot wings and that's about all that's decent on the menu and they're not even very good because it tastes like vinegar.
1179492	1184915	And they're served by women wearing really small gym shorts.
1185375	1186636	Cheerleader outfits, essentially.
1186836	1188277	Not quite, because they're not little skirts.
1188297	1191418	They're just this uber... They're the shorts that you can see ash cheeks through.
1192359	1192479	And...
1193411	1220070	and actually I read an article about a girl who went inside on Hooters just to try to find out what went on behind the scenes they ask you what your t-shirt size is and they give you one that's two sizes too small lovely and basically you're there for boobs which I have no problem with personally but I hate the whole mentality that spawned it and a question from our chatroom from someone from abroad who doesn't know better is there a male version?
1220551	1222152	there should be when I was in high school
1223038	1227702	One of my people who was in band with me that I used to march next to, she said that they should open a restaurant called Peckers.
1229043	1231585	Where it's men in speedos that wear their aprons backwards.
1232506	1233586	Did you have any other FUs?
1234447	1235828	Loki.
1236649	1243114	Just actually the Hooters, this is kind of an old FU, but FU the Hooters because their service does suck.
1243374	1247858	I mean, you might go there saying, oh yeah, we're going to go get served by hot chicks.
1248318	1250420	The chicks are dumb and the service is awful.
1250828	1259214	and they can't get anything right and it took them like two hours to serve like hot wings which is their staple food at this goddamn place and they can't prepare that even quick enough.
1259574	1264677	Then they, you know, jump around and dance and stuff and just act obnoxious and annoying the whole time.
1265358	1270461	It's obviously not worth the trip, so go to a strip club if you really want to eat with boobs around you.
1270881	1271282	Seriously.
1271642	1273583	What was that one strip club that you said had really good food?
1273603	1275004	I think it was Centerfolds.
1275084	1276085	Do you want to go?
1276125	1276585	Sure, why not?
1276605	1277065	It'll be fun.
1277245	1277806	Okay.
1278354	1279595	Don't... Well, Nellie will want to go.
1279615	1280555	Alright, we'll all go.
1280595	1285077	We'll be at OLR, uh... We'll have a staff... Let's have a staff meeting at Centerfolds.
1285097	1285597	That'll be fun.
1285738	1286438	That'll be excellent.
1286478	1287098	Alright, we'll do that.
1287138	1288879	Our next OLR staff meeting at the Titty Bar.
1289499	1293161	Um... Let's see, um... My F.U.
1293181	1297263	of the week goes to Philips, the company that made my last television.
1297978	1302019	Just over one year after buying the thing, it stopped working.
1302540	1305341	You would turn on the TV, my nice new high-definition TV.
1305361	1308782	You'd turn it on, then the image would get really bright, and then it would shut off.
1309322	1309742	And it broke.
1310142	1310942	The damn TV broke.
1311262	1314223	But thank you to Costco, who's now my favorite store ever.
1314744	1316264	They have the best return policy in the world.
1316304	1321586	I took the TV back and got a new TV from a different company that hopefully will work for more than a year.
1321666	1324107	But it has a red eye of death on it, like that 360?
1324147	1324247	Yeah.
1324955	1326876	No, it did not have the three rings of death on it.
1326916	1331159	It would shut off and then that little flashing green light would come on.
1331239	1332861	Flash, flash, flash, and that's all it would do.
1333001	1333781	So I'm tempting you.
1333861	1335242	I have power, but I'm not going to work.
1339765	1341907	Bobby's offering to fly out here for the staff meeting.
1342867	1344409	You are more than welcome to attend.
1344449	1346770	We can talk about all games business as well at the meeting.
1347250	1348351	That would be pretty funny.
1349192	1350793	That just sounds like it would be lots of fun.
1351866	1352468	DarkSakura.com
1363382	1363642	All right.
1363662	1363922	Well, um...
1389441	1399308	We are going back into the news now, and this has absolutely nothing to do with titties, but it is a little foul.
1399368	1403511	If you ever watch South Park, it's a little bit dirty, but in that way that we all love.
1403871	1414038	Well, it looks like on South Park's season premiere, they're going to be spoofing World of Warcraft, and a little 15-second teaser hit the internet this week.
1415336	1443705	and it says the World of Warcraft shows the World of Warcraft and then we hear that all too familiar voice yes that's right this Wednesday on Comedy Central that should be interesting World of Warcraft is gonna be hitting South Park yeah you know I enjoy South Park I've seen quite a few episodes it's one of my guilty pleasures
1444766	1446087	and I'm sure it's going to be hilarious.
1446107	1447768	You know, they've spoofed games before.
1447808	1455474	They've spoofed DDR and they've spoofed the Golden PSP.
1455514	1457275	Remember that whole episode with the Terry Shivo thing?
1457335	1457595	Yeah.
1457755	1459096	Yeah, so they've spoofed stuff before.
1459637	1466601	So we thought it would be fun to bring back an old favorite segment of ours tonight and have a little fun with this topic.
1467062	1467822	We're going to play Listless!
1467842	1468463	Listless!
1470942	1481191	Alright, the way Listless works is that we're going to come up with the definitive list of Orange Lounge Radio's top something with whatever category we're doing tonight.
1481431	1488057	And as a follow-up to this story, the category we're going to do tonight is game that South Park most needs to make fun of.
1488766	1491588	Now, obviously, we can't do World of Warcraft and we can't do DDR.
1491828	1493190	Here's the way Listless works.
1493570	1499855	All of the hosts are going to go around and name their top three, and then we're going to go around and eliminate one off the list.
1499895	1502016	So it gets a little vicious in here, okay?
1502397	1510303	Now, usually this game is played with four people, but since there's only three of us here in studio, we've asked one of our frequent callers and emailers to join us tonight.
1510603	1511304	Caller, are you there?
1511324	1512745	Uh, no.
1514166	1515647	I guess you must be, smartass.
1515687	1516187	What's your name?
1516227	1516848	Introduce yourself.
1517409	1517929	DMN, DMN, DMN
1545173	1547614	And just for that smart-ass remark, I'm going to make you go first.
1547894	1552235	What would be your number three pick for a game that South Park most needs to make fun of?
1552895	1553495	Night Trap.
1554135	1554995	Night Trap!
1555456	1555876	Winner.
1556916	1559737	The old Sega CD game starring Dana Plato.
1560257	1560637	Oh, yeah.
1560657	1561497	That's a great one.
1561577	1561957	Good job.
1561977	1563277	You're good at this game, DMN.
1564098	1565778	We'll see if the rest of your list is up to par, though.
1565798	1567658	But first, well, not yet, not yet.
1567678	1568379	We've got to go to Loki.
1568679	1569519	Loki, you're number three.
1571239	1574320	I would say Grand Theft Auto.
1574966	1577588	Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, DarkSakura, Karaoke Revolution,
1596480	1597581	Final Fantasy Xenoverse
1621956	1627761	So far on our list, we have Night Trap, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Karaoke Revolution, and Final Fantasy.
1628181	1631463	DMN, what would be your number two pick?
1631623	1633184	Custer's Revenge.
1633665	1635006	Custer's Revenge.
1638809	1641150	The old Atari 2600 classic, yes?
1641691	1641931	Yes.
1642271	1646894	Yes, where you can rape and pillage in very, very pixelated format.
1646914	1648536	That would be interesting to see on South Park.
1648576	1648896	I don't know.
1649554	1650955	DarkSakura, your number two pick.
1650995	1651456	Mario Kart.
1651476	1651796	Mario Kart!
1676658	1681179	Just imagine, like, they throw, uh, what was the little, what was the ball-shaped kid's name?
1682059	1682459	I don't remember.
1682499	1682919	The little Canadian.
1682939	1683319	Oh, Ike?
1683619	1683759	Ike.
1684160	1688460	You know, they throw Ike as a, as a thing, and then throw, like, like, Kenny's head.
1688520	1691821	Didn't they have, like, a South Park game that was kind of like Mario Kart?
1691901	1692101	Yeah.
1692121	1692381	Yeah.
1692421	1695882	A little bit, but they never really referenced it on the show, so I guess it could work.
1696002	1696582	All right, we'll see.
1697262	1699463	All right, um, let's see, my number two.
1699863	1701543	My number two would be, uh, Silent Hill.
1703328	1704989	I have to draw that now, you know.
1705009	1710572	Well, seeing as we're on the topic of crappy games, I thought I'd say, hey, why doesn't South Park make fun of South Park?
1710592	1710692	Yes.
1734076	1735737	Interesting, interesting little play.
1735777	1738819	Why doesn't South Park make fun of itself and its own crappy game that came out?
1739420	1740540	Yeah, good thought, good thought.
1740921	1742261	Which one, the Nintendo 64 one?
1742822	1743062	Yes.
1743122	1743862	Yeah, okay, good.
1744323	1745804	Alright, Loki, your number one pick.
1746044	1748505	Don't hate, but Katamari Damacy.
1749246	1750106	That would be funny.
1750507	1751147	I like that idea.
1751207	1752388	Katamari Damacy.
1752408	1758472	Did you see that commercial this week that was kind of inspired by Katamari Damacy?
1758492	1761674	Yeah, except they say the people who made it say it
1762168	1763469	They were not inspired by the game in any way.
1763489	1764750	I don't watch TV, so I have no idea what it is.
1764950	1765651	It's on YouTube.
1766091	1766331	Okay.
1766371	1767152	That's the new TV.
1767372	1769394	Alright, DarkSakura, what would be your number one?
1769634	1770114	The Sims.
1770735	1771596	The Sims!
1771856	1772636	Oh, that's a good one as well.
1772677	1776039	Imagine they do have somebody controlling them walking around town.
1776359	1777000	Good one, good one.
1777661	1783465	Alright, first, before I name my number one, let's go and look at some chatroom picks.
1783845	1785587	Here's some things the chatroom are suggesting.
1786307	1788149	OLArmyEddy says, Dead or Alive.
1788830	1790611	GS68 says, Mortal Kombat.
1791629	1791989	Let's see.
1792049	1793470	Drunami says Africa.
1794811	1796431	Meklar says Loco Roco.
1796852	1798632	GS68 says Genji 2.
1799473	1801213	Raven's Dolphin says Dead Rising.
1801634	1803214	Blazer says Gradius.
1803695	1804695	All very good guesses.
1804735	1806536	Loco Roco would be funny with Cartman.
1806676	1807336	That would be funny.
1808237	1810578	How about Your Mom the Game last night?
1810738	1811758	Here it is in bed.
1812298	1812879	All right, here it is.
1813139	1814960	My number one pick is none of those.
1815540	1820182	It's a game that desperately needs to be made fun of, especially after this week that I got my hands on it.
1820996	1822477	Sonic the Hedgehog for 360.
1829223	1835909	All right, so here's the list as it stands so far, and we're going to have to take one of these off the list, DMN.
1836009	1842895	You've got to take one of these off the list, and unfortunately the chat room will not be able to vote for it because you've ruined their hopes and dreams to be able to vote for it.
1842935	1843256	Here it is.
1843316	1844677	Here's the list as it stands so far.
1845237	1845818	Night Trap.
1846371	1862054	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Karaoke Revolution, Final Fantasy, Custer's Revenge, Twisted Metal, Mario Kart, Silent Hill, South Park the Game, Katamari Damacy, The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.
1863595	1866295	DMN, which one of these do you say South Park should not make fun of?
1866335	1867275	Which come off the list?
1868816	1871636	Um... Twisted Metal.
1872416	1873677	Twisted Metal!
1874077	1875517	Yeah, that was a little obscure, wasn't it?
1876557	1878878	Night Trap would be too obscure.
1901605	1903126	Night Trap is too obscure.
1903166	1913855	As much as I agree, either Night Trap or like Sewer Shark or something, nobody, unless they were in our, you know, age range of gamer, probably wouldn't get it.
1914496	1914876	All right.
1916017	1920381	A lot, you know what, every pick that's left here is actually pretty good, so this is hard for me to take one off.
1920861	1924344	I'm going to take off, Jamie, don't hate me, I'm taking off Karaoke Revolution.
1924785	1925085	Okay.
1925185	1928688	Because since they already made fun of DDR, it's kind of close for me, so...
1934898	1943423	Alright, here we go, chat room, you now have the chance to vote on your favorite.
1943503	1948665	I need you to give a number one and a number two, and here is what you get to vote on.
1949006	1951407	Alright, and DMN, you don't get to vote, because you already helped.
1952780	1954641	Here it is, here's the list, and I posted it there in chat.
1954921	1963767	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Final Fantasy, Custer's Revenge, Mario Kart, Silent Hill, Katamari Damacy, The Sims, and Sonic the Hedgehog 360.
1965028	1966409	Place votes now.
1966469	1968251	Your number one and number two picks.
1968311	1971573	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1971593	1974055	Remember, it doesn't count unless it's over a private message.
1974275	1977077	We'll tally up the votes and reveal it shortly here in the show.
1977497	1978458	DMN, thanks for your help.
1979366	1979926	No problem.
1979946	1980706	You guys have a good night.
2002915	2004515	Well, some interesting stuff.
2004896	2009437	This could also be, I guess, parodied on South Park, but the whole controversy with Bully.
2009457	2011437	Apparently, people were wrong.
2011997	2026862	It says, you know, Bully has been shown to, E3 was shown to very few press people, but now that it's almost out, actually in the next couple weeks, it's been shown to a lot more people.
2027362	2032263	And actually, the game itself, which garnered a teen rating, isn't a
2033157	2034158	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2056164	2061526	Alright, speaking of politically oriented things, you know, we love those guys over at GamePolitics.
2061586	2075431	We just wanted to give a mention that GamePolitics.com has launched this week, and unfortunately it means they have come off of LiveJournal for their commenting system, but they have a fancy schmancy new website made in WordPress, so you should check it out, GamePolitics.com.
2075451	2076692	We just wanted to give them a shout out.
2078050	2082791	and DarkSakura is going to give another website a shout out right now because she surfs the web up and down every week.
2083091	2083411	At work.
2083932	2087512	At work, so she can find a pick worthy to share with the rest of you all.
2087673	2088693	And it's her website of the week.
2088733	2089073	Here it is.
2092794	2096155	You know, we should really be using the Mr. Rogers music for this part.
2096255	2096915	Maybe next week.
2097015	2097255	Okay.
2098459	2108103	At any rate, my site of the week is actually one that another of our listeners linked to me when I did the Doctor Who site last week, but it's actually a very good Doctor Who fan site.
2108603	2110144	It's Doctor Who Online.
2111264	2123729	The website address is doctorwho-online.co.uk and doctor is drwho-online.co.uk Oh my god, this site is fantastic.
2125190	2127951	They actually have the Doctor Who Online WhoCast
2128692	2132354	Which I'm going to be giving a try within the week.
2133575	2135276	Lots of really good stuff.
2135736	2138037	They have a little area called Psychic Paper.
2138698	2139718	References.
2140439	2142020	Just a lot of stuff.
2142120	2144501	Even an eBay link to a shop.
2144621	2146202	It's a really fantastic site.
2146242	2151525	So I suggest going to it if there's a place to comment.
2151545	2152726	Some orange on the radio sent you.
2154487	2154927	Excellent.
2156148	2156328	Well...
2157303	2162106	Got some cool stuff here, especially from the folks that make Gears of War epic.
2162707	2171853	Their thought on the whole Xbox 360 is you don't need to have an HDTV to be able to enjoy their games.
2172133	2179738	And so they are making sure by testing their game, Gears of War, on a bunch of small SDTVs
2180233	2182414	Make sure that you can read the text in the game.
2182554	2189216	Unlike, say, Capcom, who couldn't give a flying fuck that you don't have a HDTV.
2189416	2191537	So at least someone's getting it right.
2192097	2192937	So that's awfully good.
2193698	2194538	Very reassuring.
2195478	2203581	Well, another reassuring news, actually, for anyone who's thinking that, oh, Wii's coming out, I don't have to keep my GameCube stuff.
2204061	2204221	No.
2204801	2209703	The WaveBirds are apparently going to be able to be used on the Wii.
2210325	2229707	and certain Wii games you will still need your receiver plug-in there's a slot on top of the console that you can plug that into but there's not really any word out as far as how well it's going to work with virtual console but it's apparently going to work with the Wii anyway so yay
2233326	2238331	Alright, well, I'm still trying to tally up the listless votes, so maybe we ought to just go on to our next story.
2238351	2242755	We got flooded with, we have over 50 votes tonight for listless.
2242795	2243716	I'm trying to crazy tally them up.
2243736	2245658	I'm sorry, Bobby, nice try, nice try.
2247800	2256148	Well, you know, for anybody who is a bit of a snake charmer, you can play with your snake, in public no less, and not get arrested for it.
2257666	2264469	There are already Metal Gear Solid 4 figures that will go out with the release of the game on the PS3.
2265090	2267831	A 12-inch tall made by Medicom.
2267891	2270692	Medicom puts out some really nice figures, by the way.
2271673	2277595	There's a prototype model up on GayGamer.net that looks pretty cool.
2277675	2278856	Snake's just really old, though.
2280016	2280597	I'm sorry.
2281317	2284598	But the figure, though, is...
2287043	2295989	They're stating that it may be something about 95,000 yen up to maybe 20,000.
2297310	2298011	So I don't know.
2299852	2304395	I do think the comment on the form here is Snake's got a great ass for an old guy.
2306456	2306897	That's true.
2307097	2308478	Snake does have a good ass for an old guy.
2311460	2312721	So Rob, how's Italian going?
2312901	2314142	I'm almost done.
2315137	2317078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2341474	2342174	So that's awesome.
2342194	2342875	It's going to be awesome.
2343655	2345216	Also, you can always call us.
2345256	2353939	The other free way would be to go on to OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on Interact With Us, and get the information on Skype, username OrangeLoungeRadio.
2354219	2355080	Go for it, Loki.
2355420	2363403	Anyways, as we like to do every week, we're reporting some stuff that you might not know yet because it hasn't been reported on the front of a magazine.
2363883	2369286	Well, the first, of course, actually the only one I have this week is Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360.
2370362	2370842	Dropdown to $39.99.
2372063	2375885	So if you don't own it yet, might be a time to find a used one.
2376205	2377885	Now, they should be even cheaper than that.
2378326	2383168	Although, I mean, Call of Duty 3 is coming out in November, so whatever.
2383748	2384508	It's a good game, though.
2384548	2387750	Definitely worth the multiplayer, so check it out.
2388050	2389150	Some other fun news.
2389511	2394173	Nintendo, there was a whole controversy about the Wii using the friend codes.
2394333	2396534	Well, they're going to make it a little bit easier on you.
2396814	2399095	They will be using the friend's code system
2399505	2403508	However, they are going to only require that you have one friend code.
2403768	2407992	So you'll be able to share that friend code and then be friended for all the other games.
2408152	2412275	So that is good, you know, at least a good way to do that.
2412615	2414177	I swear I had that in the show role.
2414197	2414837	That's crazy.
2415238	2415618	My bad.
2415918	2417820	And then there's some other stuff.
2419101	2420402	There was actually legislation...
2421363	2428546	That's in the house right now to require the ESRB to actually play through the entire game before reviewing them.
2428927	2430167	So that's kind of interesting.
2430187	2433749	I don't think it's going to work because, you know, that would take forever.
2433769	2435630	It would seriously delay the release of all games.
2435710	2440752	It would delay games, and how would you do, like, MMOs or games that have new content added to them constantly?
2441713	2442593	I don't think it's going to work.
2442673	2443534	It's unrealistic.
2443594	2448116	And why are they having, why is the government concerning themselves with this kind of stuff anyways?
2448176	2448376	I mean...
2449606	2462735	What I think should be is that I think that on the websites there should be a parent link for any internet savvy parent to go online, get content warnings of the games more in depth.
2462835	2467758	I think the manufacturer does have a degree of responsibility to make sure that...
2468437	2477061	They give accurate listings, but if they're really so concerned about it, then they can make it a requirement for the manufacturers to have more information made available.
2477482	2483225	Or you know how when you buy food, it says for nutritional content, write into this address or go on this website?
2483685	2484985	I think it should be the same thing.
2485566	2492149	However, I think that it really is up to the parent to do the research before allowing their child to buy the game.
2492769	2497032	As far as children, though, buying the games without their parents' permission, oh well.
2497052	2497852	Yeah.
2499155	2503897	Some other fun stuff, Rockstar announced a brand new series this week actually called L.A.
2503977	2515760	Noire, and more information should be coming out when the official trailer is released on October 5th, and if you want more information on that, you can visit rockstargames.com slash L.A.
2515800	2526424	Noire, that's L-A-N-O-I-R-E, and looks like it's going to be a game that, of course, you know, kind of pays tribute to a lot of the film noir movies, much like, you
2528077	2532839	LA Confidential, or even if you want to go really old, the Maltese Falcon.
2533460	2535141	So that should be pretty cool.
2535801	2537241	Kind of Grand Theft Auto-ish.
2538022	2539282	So I'm looking forward to that.
2539603	2542704	And then finally, some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.
2542744	2546626	As we mentioned before, Sierra is planning on releasing some games to Xbox Live Arcade.
2547286	2547706	King's Quest?
2547726	2548627	King's Quest?
2548727	2549167	King's Quest?
2550448	2550948	No, not yet.
2550968	2551228	Damn it!
2551708	2557031	The first couple of games that were announced, Assault Heroes, which is going to be another over-the-head...
2558342	2564946	kind of shooter game that, you know, using two analog sticks, think, you know, Geometry Wars, but still pretty cool.
2565427	2572491	And then my favorite game, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, and that was a really fun mini golf game.
2572511	2573892	I used to piss off people with that.
2574572	2581057	And then, of course, Codemasters also announced the X-06 Sensible Soccer, which I think was announced even before that.
2582337	2586280	And, of course, a very classic game should be making its way.
2587475	2589316	I wanted to go to the chat room for some comments here.
2589416	2593779	DNL, who, by the way, posted some great artwork to our LiveJournal community this week.
2594360	2597062	Check it out if you're a user of LiveJournal or Community Orange Lounge on there.
2597622	2605427	DNL says, in regards to the ESRB thing, on the back of the package it does say ESRB content rating, www.esrb.org.
2605968	2612672	And also something I wanted to add on that whole ESRB thing is that when you play a game online, you always do get that, you know, warning that comes up.
2612812	2616595	Warning, game experience may change with online play, do-do-do, type thing, so...
2617458	2618338	Something to think about.
2619319	2622741	Alright, I finally have some results for you guys.
2622781	2623181	You ready?
2624642	2625802	My god, that was a lot of work.
2627583	2628343	Alright, here it is.
2628403	2629304	The definitive list.
2629384	2632225	Games we would like to see South Park make fun of next.
2632586	2635927	And I gotta tell you, this list turned out really freaking weird.
2636267	2639209	Considering we had so many votes, there were a lot of ties.
2639649	2640289	So here it is.
2641090	2645352	The number one game you want to see South Park make fun of was a tie.
2646943	2676786	Game number one, Silent Hill And game number two, Katamari Damacy Those games tied for first place Damacy Whatever And now what's interesting is so that takes us to third place And there was also a tie So we have two games tying for third place Because you know, you have first and second place basically tied there So for third place we have Grand Theft Auto San Andreas And Final Fantasy Are the two games that came in third place there
2677520	2678760	So that is the definitive list.
2678780	2682901	Thank you guys all for voting and giving me a lot of work there during that segment.
2684742	2685402	Yikes.
2686062	2688362	Well, we'll see if any of those actually make it to the show.
2688922	2690083	And you can say you heard it here first.
2690483	2693983	Let's go to the Skype line, boys and girls, and take some calls.
2695464	2696504	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2696524	2696904	Who's this?
2697624	2698464	Raven's Dolphin.
2698584	2699365	Hi, my friend.
2699405	2700005	What's on your mind?
2701325	2702925	I just want to say one news, Brian.
2703425	2704866	Yeah?
2705226	2706046	It's GameFly.
2707369	2707669	Uh-huh.
2708870	2711893	They actually did some more things with Gamefly.
2711933	2713734	They now have four tiers now.
2714935	2715655	Four tiers?
2716516	2718558	Yeah, now you can get one game for $15.99.
2719318	2721120	You can get two games for $21.
2721280	2724002	Now, they just added this.
2724442	2731067	Three games for $30, or you can go for the Kin Kaboodle, which you'll lock yourself in your room forever.
2731628	2732809	Four games for $40.
2733990	2735671	Netflix does like eight games.
2736454	2738395	You can do like up to eight movies on Netflix.
2738655	2741236	So, you know, at least I think you can.
2741356	2742816	You know, so I'm not too surprised.
2743037	2745237	They probably would let you do more if you really want.
2745257	2747298	But damn, what do you need with five games at a time?
2747398	2748839	What do you need with four games at a time?
2749379	2749999	Two is enough.
2750339	2752960	Two is enough so that you have, I mean, even, well, one's really enough.
2752980	2755741	But two is enough so that when one's in the mail, you still have something to play.
2756602	2757022	That's right.
2757362	2760163	So they don't need more than that, in my opinion, but whatever.
2760423	2762864	You know, if that's what you, it's your money, spend it how you want.
2763863	2764844	Yeah, because I'm poor.
2764864	2766045	I have to save up for a week.
2766325	2767426	Are you a Gamefly subscriber?
2768067	2768547	Yes, I am.
2768647	2769348	I don't use them.
2769408	2770168	What do you think of them?
2770308	2771710	I mean, it's not because I dislike them or anything.
2771730	2773491	I just, at this time, choose not to use them.
2773791	2774492	What do you think of them?
2775533	2776914	Actually, they got really better.
2777514	2781918	Before, at first, they didn't ship my games for like nine days, and now it's coming to four.
2784500	2789444	Blackwolf in our chatroom is commenting, you just had to be a member for a month before you got the third game option.
2789724	2791546	They had three games from Gamefly years ago.
2791586	2792647	The four games is new.
2793934	2797238	Well, they just gave it to me for 25 cents this month, Black Wolf.
2797278	2797838	I'm sorry.
2797858	2799841	I guess they're not nice to me.
2800581	2800922	All right.
2801903	2803484	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
2804606	2805967	Yeah, one other thing.
2806007	2806608	Sure.
2807669	2808109	What is it?
2810652	2811133	What was it?
2811273	2811833	Oh, I know.
2812094	2812294	I know.
2812574	2815257	I just bought an iPod, so I'm now mad at Apple.
2815678	2815838	Why?
2816912	2818753	Because they just came out with the new Nanos.
2819173	2821734	And it looks like a little mini iPod.
2821774	2823395	Remember the ones with the black and white screen?
2823455	2823775	Yeah, yeah.
2823795	2824515	The iPod Mini?
2824816	2825016	Yeah.
2825876	2828677	Now I got an old Nano, so I'm not mad at them.
2828697	2830698	Well, you might... Well, I doubt you could do it.
2830858	2836100	Because sometimes if they do a price cut, like a week after you bought it, they'll give you a refund.
2836160	2839762	But maybe not with the old models versus new models.
2839842	2840722	But you never know.
2840803	2841483	Check their website.
2841523	2841843	I don't know.
2842483	2843264	Couldn't tell you.
2844264	2846005	Yeah, I'm... And...
2846618	2847599	That's about it.
2847619	2848860	Hi, can you guys hear me?
2848880	2850081	Oh, hi, this is Blue Monster from the chat room.
2850101	2850821	Hi, what's on your mind?
2850841	2850901	Hi.
2851502	2851542	Hi.
2870063	2871604	I just wanted to share two things.
2871764	2876446	The first one is, congrats on the show, man, because seriously, it's something I look forward to every week.
2876866	2877907	Thank you, I really appreciate that.
2878567	2881829	A constant in your life, you know, as I was telling you earlier, DarkSakura.
2882549	2887732	Anyways, the second little thing I wanted to share with you guys is, I picked up Okami last week.
2888752	2892574	Yes, that's a game I've heard a lot of great things about and seen a lot of good things about.
2892654	2895916	I'm a little tight on my gaming budget right now, so I haven't been able to pick it up.
2896396	2897697	But, yeah, I'm really curious.
2897717	2898537	What do you think of this game?
2899218	2900499	That's what I actually wanted to call.
2900539	2902240	I wanted to give you like a mini-review kind of thing.
2904502	2905283	It's a pretty good game.
2905483	2906183	It's a pretty good game.
2906523	2911347	It's very Zelda-ish, but the only thing I have against it is there's a lot of hand-holding.
2911387	2914549	Like, the first dozen hours, I put all my 24 in it.
2915030	2917331	The first 12 hours is like nothing but hand-holding.
2917351	2919793	Like, they tell you everything the way you gotta stop it.
2919813	2923256	So if you're looking for some hardcore Zelda-ish style of gameplay...
2924459	2928681	You'll have a hard time getting through it, at least for the first half.
2928921	2938024	You know, Enchanted Arms, which is a game I have been playing lately, is very similar because every time you go into a new dungeon, it seems like there's some new environmental thing.
2938064	2940264	Like, press A to get into the cart.
2940604	2942065	Press A to move the teleport.
2942085	2945486	And they'll have to have this whole back and forth where the main character is like, how do I do this?
2945831	2954878	and one of the other smarter people in the party says, well, you walk up to it and press A. But that's the answer every single time you walk up to it and press A. They could have just said in the beginning.
2954918	2967609	They have a little tune that's like jumping up and down the nose of the wolf and he tells you all the time, oh, maybe if I should use my brush to cut this vine, which I've been doing for the past six hours, please let me do it myself.
2969170	2975375	They should just have had a thing that says, hey, whenever you see new shit, press A. Exactly, yeah.
2975663	2994044	But overall, it's a really good music, really good art style, the graphics are really good, there is a bit of slowdown, because there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen sometimes, but overall, it's a really good game, it seems long, because I've already put 24 hours in it, and the game actually just got started, and the hand-holding just now stopped, so I'm guessing...
2994798	2996099	Yeah, long game.
2996179	2999321	So it's a good game to get if you're waiting for Final Princess, I guess.
2999802	3000102	Awesome.
3000142	3001323	Now one other question I have for you.
3001363	3007788	For those that don't know much about Okami, I mean, maybe we've seen the graphics, you know, that it has that very unique hand-drawn style to it.
3008188	3010370	What would you compare this game to?
3010410	3017275	If you could compare it to any other game, you know, maybe half this and half this, what would you say it's kind of like for people that want to know if they'd be interested in this or not?
3018198	3028827	Mix the world of Wind Waker and the style, cartoony style of Wind Waker, but also add a bit of a stench of Chester Radio or Chester Radio Future and maybe some beautiful Joe in it.
3029527	3029987	Interesting.
3030488	3030808	Interesting.
3030848	3034431	And all those games kind of have that same art style too, so that's kind of interesting.
3034989	3039813	The thing is that Wind Waker is very clean looking, this is more dirty.
3040714	3045438	The graphics are not that clean because of the brush thing and the whole brush theme that it has.
3045898	3048520	So it's more beautiful Joe-ish, but it's still really good.
3048540	3051743	It's very Japanese, so you've got to be open-minded about it.
3052303	3056287	It's still a really good game, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's stuck on the game.
3056787	3057688	And don't be scared.
3058188	3061391	It's not as platformer as it seems to be.
3061611	3063773	It's more adventure-ish and more pilot-ish, I guess.
3064167	3067631	I'm calling from Argentina, it's 1am in the morning over here What's it like in Argentina?
3087476	3088217	Well, here's the thing.
3089058	3099371	You pay about 80 US dollars for a game, between 70 or 80, if you want the original copy, of course, because there's a black market here, like, you wouldn't believe, like, you can buy a game for 2 bucks if you want to, US.
3099512	3099832	Wow.
3100253	3104318	But, yeah, but if you actually want an original game, you gotta pay about 70, 80 bucks.
3106048	3108290	and it's all games because you don't get the new stuff right away.
3108810	3116735	And you got to take into account that a maid here, like a maid full-time maid here, maybe costs 200 US dollars a month.
3117215	3117595	Wow.
3118476	3119296	Wow.
3119817	3120137	I know.
3120237	3124540	So it's like basically a game is about half the salary of a maid per month.
3124760	3125220	Gosh.
3125600	3128342	Well, hey, now your copy of Okami is legit though, right?
3129392	3129993	Uh, no, really.
3130113	3131514	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
3132995	3136639	Well, we better hurry and end this call.
3136879	3138240	We won't tell on you.
3138881	3140182	We won't give out your full name or anything.
3140703	3141944	I'm glad you got to call in, though.
3142064	3142284	Yeah.
3143105	3144146	Yeah, I'm glad I got to call in.
3144566	3144906	All right.
3146628	3150872	Well, have fun with the game, and we know that when you can't afford it, you will buy the legit copy.
3151681	3153622	I already put it up there, so, you know.
3153822	3154742	Oh, good, good, okay.
3154982	3155263	All right.
3156603	3157163	Happy ending.
3157223	3157564	All right.
3157964	3158704	Take care, buddy.
3158744	3159544	Thanks for calling.
3160365	3160665	See ya.
3160965	3161245	Bye.
3161725	3162386	That's great.
3162446	3163426	We love hearing from people.
3164767	3170189	You can't say overseas, but over planet, because, you know, you're all the way down there right now.
3170209	3172330	I just gotta keep looking south.
3172350	3172630	Oh, my God.
3172670	3174071	SSJ100Math's going, happy ending.
3174451	3177972	The thing is, is that I'm in massage therapy school, so I know what you mean.
3178232	3179013	Oh, God.
3179073	3179473	You guys...
3180424	3181164	Go play Uno.
3181224	3182845	They cover that in massage therapy school?
3182865	3183486	No, they don't.
3184146	3185367	I haven't started school yet, though.
3185387	3186747	Go play Uno, you sick fucks.
3186887	3187207	All right.
3188028	3188988	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3189028	3189409	Who's this?
3190029	3190849	Hi, this is Eddie.
3191270	3191610	Hi, Eddie.
3191630	3192350	What's on your mind, buddy?
3193511	3203836	Yeah, I was just wondering if you heard about that thing, like a guy posted on the All Games forums that he was booted out of Uno because somebody saw that he was a black guy.
3205427	3207168	I did read that post.
3207248	3208409	That is so fucked up.
3208629	3209710	I did read that post.
3209870	3212311	Yeah, somebody... Oh, that sucks.
3212331	3213552	I don't think I know about this.
3213612	3213992	You know what?
3214192	3215233	Oh, no.
3216193	3217934	God, can we find the post real quick?
3219515	3220496	This just made me so angry.
3222077	3223778	Some people are so stupid.
3224518	3225099	Swear to God.
3225419	3226039	Let's see if I can find it.
3226059	3227180	Do you remember what forum it was in?
3229041	3229841	It was the...
3231044	3235767	Let me ask you real quick, while I hunt for the post, is there any other topics you want to bring up tonight?
3237087	3241009	Well, I had something related to that thing.
3241390	3251275	One of the replies to the article was that that's why the me on the we thing is so good, because you can create your own avatar or whatever.
3252075	3256277	And I was just thinking that it doesn't really solve the racism issue, since...
3257591	3258272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3270447	3272309	and it shouldn't matter.
3272469	3273290	It shouldn't matter at all.
3273390	3278254	I mean, in World of Warcraft, we play purple and green people and it doesn't matter, you know?
3278855	3279896	Yeah, yeah.
3280056	3285741	And, you know, when they demoed the Wii, they showed them making Samuel L. Jackson the baddest motherfucker on the planet.
3286121	3291066	You know, I would cower in fear if I was playing against Samuel L. Jackson, you know, because...
3291414	3295599	He's a badass, but people are just so superficial.
3295919	3296800	Anyway, I found the post.
3297061	3297381	Here it is.
3297861	3301085	I realize probably like 50 of you linked it in chat room, but I did find it on my own.
3301105	3301626	Thank you very much.
3302086	3302347	Here it is.
3302387	3303528	This was made by a post.
3303708	3309895	The guy is named Five Fingers of Death, and this is on allgames.com's forums in the Xbox 360 section.
3309935	3312158	Does Vision Cam hamper jump in Vision of Live?
3312862	3341365	I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this I purchased my vision cam last week and hooked it up to experience a couple of multiplayer UNO sessions when I connected all three people I was paired with also had the camera I heard someone mention he's a black guy and then I was booted by the host as we know live has always had its racist comments but for the most part you could never really tell who you were gaming with for all we know David Duke could be playing with Louis Farrakhan and neither would be the wiser now being able to actually see the person how will this affect the live community just wondering
3342321	3346463	Oh, I can't wait for me to get on the camera and have somebody go, That guy looks like a fag.
3346763	3347143	Boot him.
3348544	3350545	You wouldn't want to play with those fuckers anyway.
3350665	3353607	I mean, it's fucked up.
3353807	3354447	It's stupid.
3355008	3358930	Put all those people on your ban list and warn them and damage them the best you can.
3359470	3360410	It's so stupid.
3362211	3365933	They obviously don't want to play a good game, good old-fashioned game of Uno anyway.
3366213	3368154	I mean, it doesn't make it right at all.
3368915	3371416	By any means does it make it right, but I guess...
3372429	3377172	Until, you know, Microsoft steps in and I don't even know what Microsoft can do.
3377672	3378333	What can they do?
3379373	3379714	Ban.
3380314	3382676	So it's up to the community to police itself, I suppose.
3383616	3383956	I don't know.
3385377	3385958	Disturbing.
3386738	3387779	Anything else you wanted to say on that?
3389640	3394423	Well, not on that issue, but take pictures of cookie box.
3394783	3395144	I will.
3395584	3395884	I will.
3395924	3399526	So you can get them from Granville Island, one of my favorite places in Vancouver.
3399686	3400327	I appreciate it.
3400927	3401087	Yep.
3401348	3401528	All right.
3401548	3402048	Have a good one, buddy.
3402628	3404509	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3431491	3436672	No, what I was training with the Marines, they were showing us the tapes of famous Marines on the tape.
3436692	3438392	Wow.
3439152	3443253	Okay, well, you know, I'm not going to say you're a liar.
3443293	3444773	I just always thought that was an urban legend.
3444793	3445554	I didn't think that was true.
3445974	3448254	That was the first time I ever heard it when I saw the tape.
3449034	3452255	Actually, I think I remember my brother telling me something about that.
3452275	3455295	Well, me and my brother actually just was released from the Marines.
3456035	3458856	Firebomba says, WTF, Mr. Rogers is a camper.
3459724	3461225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3483860	3484581	Okay, you know what?
3484641	3487543	On Wikipedia, that whole thing is filed under urban legends.
3487583	3488103	Here's what it says.
3488424	3488584	Yikes.
3509707	3510507	Maybe that's it.
3510527	3512107	You need to give your Wikipedia to your friend.
3512127	3516368	But he also was a Presbyterian minister and left the clergy to work with children.
3516508	3516988	That's true.
3518349	3523930	Anyway, I just realized podcast listeners may not understand why we're suddenly talking about Mr. Rogers.
3524390	3530951	We do a bonus segment when we tape live when we'll sometimes play things off of YouTube and such and that was the subject this week was Mr. Rogers.
3531731	3534752	Sorry, just for the podcast people's sake who maybe didn't hear that live.
3535492	3536732	Anyway, anything else on your mind, Ranma?
3537455	3539536	I've decided not to buy a PlayStation 3.
3539896	3540356	Why is this?
3541196	3547279	I was watching, I was following like the Sony's podcast, livecast of the PSN and everything.
3547719	3549680	Now they're doing their version of the virtual console.
3549860	3551960	On that fact alone, I refuse to buy one.
3552581	3556862	Well, okay, is it because you feel they're ripping them off or something?
3557543	3558383	Yeah, I mean...
3559153	3568219	They say imitation is the greatest form for flattery, but come on Sony's been ripping off people left and right with the PS3 But couldn't you say that the Virtual Console is a form of Xbox Live Arcade?
3569460	3574424	Yes and no, but the thing is the Virtual Console has all these classic games by Nintendo
3575066	3576767	Xbox Live Arcade Xbox Live Arcade Xbox Live Arcade
3603925	3604865	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
3605866	3607366	But to not buy a system over it?
3608407	3609407	I mean, what if they did it better?
3611028	3613429	Eh, I just can't see myself, you know.
3613789	3615350	And no, Zarko, I'm not a fanboy.
3615370	3616570	I just don't have 600 bucks.
3618171	3621692	Yeah, there's the realistic reason why none of us are getting a PS3 at launch.
3621732	3623373	At least I think I can speak... Well, I don't know.
3623393	3624314	I guess Jamie's getting one.
3624334	3626274	But I know I can't afford 600 bucks.
3626654	3628715	For 600 bucks, it better come with a lap dance.
3628935	3630076	For 600 bucks, it better...
3631371	3632191	Suck... Never mind.
3632452	3633472	I'm not going to finish that thought.
3633792	3634413	Yeah, okay.
3634433	3635273	You know what I'm thinking.
3635293	3636093	You know what I'm thinking.
3638635	3640095	Alright, anything else on your mind, Ranma?
3640456	3640796	That's it.
3640836	3641716	I love you guys.
3642557	3643017	Love you too.
3643097	3643717	Take care, buddy.
3644278	3644998	See you next month.
3645078	3645758	Alright, bye.
3645798	3646199	Bye.
3647179	3647499	That's right.
3647539	3651481	I'm coming to Orange... I'm coming to New York City very soon.
3651521	3653622	And I'll have details on where I'm going to be and when.
3654203	3654843	Hopefully soon.
3655529	3661954	I feel weird because now I think there's at least more than a handful of people that want to come meet up, so I feel weird about doing that at a store unannounced.
3662294	3664616	So I'm trying to figure something out creative we can do.
3664676	3664997	We'll see.
3665137	3666318	I'll have to work with some people in New York.
3667178	3667759	That'll be fun, though.
3668900	3672442	Anyways, are there any other last-minute stories that any of you guys have?
3672483	3675225	Thank you guys, by the way, all of you guys that called in tonight.
3675585	3677086	And sorry to those we didn't get to.
3677146	3679128	We're just running out low on time.
3681950	3682290	Not really.
3682931	3683111	All right.
3683737	3692380	I have one quick story I wanted to share here from BamaniStyle.com has posted a list of elite beat agents, a song list, at least partial.
3692480	3699983	Well, yeah, again, because apparently it's being shown off on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, and they were able to get some of the songs from the game.
3700883	3713188	YMCA by Village People, Highway Star by Deep Purple, Rock This Town by Stray Cats, Walkie Talkie Man by Stereogram, Makes No Difference by Sum 41, September by Earth, Wind & Fire, Skater Boy by Avril Lavigne,
3713527	3715168	and I Was Born to Love You by Queen.
3716368	3716769	All right.
3717729	3721391	If you want to check out what stages those are related to, check out BomaniStyle.com.
3721411	3723172	There's a more complete list over there.
3724452	3727434	And on that note, I guess we're going to end the show.
3727854	3730175	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3730856	3732016	Loki, your final thought.
3732336	3734417	I don't know.
3734557	3735738	I ran out of milkshake.
3736919	3737679	I'm sorry to hear that.
3738674	3746678	My final thought would be I need to adjust the sound on my new TV because it sounds like I'm playing Beatmania in a tin can and that's not fun.
3747558	3748599	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3748999	3749999	Reject false icons.
3750639	3752660	And Julie's meeting us for dinner.
3753241	3753581	Sweet.
3754441	3755061	I need some dinner.
3755081	3756902	She has my house keys because she had to feed my cat.
3757342	3759863	I need some big time dinner action.
3759944	3761464	So to do that, we have to finish the show.
3761624	3762285	Good night, everybody.
3762665	3767867	Thank you so much for supporting independent internet radio even when the hosts stutter.
3768812	3771654	and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
