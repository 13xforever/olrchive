00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,640
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 204 for this October the 15th of 2006.

2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,600
If this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget that Orange Lounge

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,880
Radio is podcast twice a week, so you're actually listening to the second half of a show already

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
in progress.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,200
If you want to catch the whole thing live when it broadcasts, you should listen to Orange

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,080
Lounge Radio live on Sunday nights, or there's always our rebroadcast that plays on all games

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,240
radio Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,260
Speaking of all games radio, our buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show over there Sunday

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,520
nights as well just before we do, he's going to be doing some type of trivia contest at

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,640
the big video games expo, which I wish I was going, but sadly I'm not.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,000
The VG Expo, if you're within traveling distance, unfortunately, when I talk about going now

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,760
we're talking about a plane ticket, but for those of you on the East Coast, it's probably

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,640
very drivable from lots of different spots on the East Coast.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Check it out.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,080
Valley Forge Convention Center right outside Philly, October 27th through the 29th, VGExpo.com.

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,880
Bobby wanted me to point out, for those of you that went to Digital Life, this is only

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,080
a couple hours from New York, and this is nothing but games at this show, so check it

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
out.

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,800
Bobby's going to be doing some game show hosting, which I'm a little bit jealous because I like

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,200
hosting game shows, but sadly no con has asked us to do a game show yet, oh well.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Such is life.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Yes.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Back to games.

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Exactly.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,240
Well, such is life that we would have more news about Halo 3 at some point, and at some

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
point it's going to be Halloween.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:02:00,720
Yes, the spooky holiday will feature some brand new news about Halo 3, and yeah, that's

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,880
about all we know is that there's going to be news.

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:11,040
It's news about upcoming news, and Halo 3 is coming soon.

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,440
That's going to be the big news.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,600
Do you think, as we theorized previously, because you know you have that whole report

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,620
talking about Halo 3 is likely to be coming out in April or May, do you think this could

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,520
be where they drop that bombshell?

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,620
Could this be the big bombshell that's coming out?

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,200
It would be aptly timed, but probably not.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,840
Do you think it's more something along the notion of gameplay?

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,680
You know this is time, though, to take a little bit of Sony's thunder from PlayStation 3,

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,640
to get people talking about Halo 3 amongst the PlayStation 3 and Wii chaos that's sure

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
to be going on in November.

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,600
Well, I guess currently right now they're showing Halo 3 to a select group of magazine

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,880
journalists, not websites, but a handful of magazine folks, and yeah, it looks like they're

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,760
going to be having some sort of an event, and they're inviting game journalists from

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,160
the U.S. and Europe to visit their studio and show a quick single player demo.

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,160
All right, well, you know, I would say go out and buy the magazine to see the news,

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,160
but it's going to be all over the Internet the day it comes out anyway, probably before

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,280
it lands in your mailbox, so just read the Internet.

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,080
Speaking of things that are at least being said around the Internet and other places,

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Sony's talking some crap.

49
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Actually, to be specific, that would be Nobuyuki Ide, who was the former CEO of Sony.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,920
He's actually their current chief corporate advisor, so when he was asked about the Xbox

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,200
360 beating the PS3 to market, he said Microsoft is not a technology company.

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,320
No, they make lunchboxes.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:08,480
Well, and Nintendo makes cards, at least they used to back in the day, but, you know.

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
Yeah, they made Hanafuda cards.

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,120
Does it used to run brothels, too?

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,960
I really don't know.

57
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,480
I just think that that's funny, because this guy was responsible for a lot of damage to

58
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,800
Sony's profits back in the day.

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,040
I think that it would be in Sony's best interest right now not to be throwing mud.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
That's what I would be doing.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,040
You know, concentrate on getting your console out instead of saying, our console is better

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,800
than your console, except our console is not out yet, and yours is.

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Well, Sony pisses me off even more, because they're discontinuing the iBo.

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I love the iBo.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,920
Yeah, but the iBo is useless.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,120
The iBo is their little robot dog.

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,800
I think that if they're going to do anything, they should make the iBo a peripheral for

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
the PS3.

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
That would sell more units.

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,240
Oh, yeah, I think that might actually happen.

71
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,360
That might sell me one.

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I'd buy one.

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
That's just what I need.

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
My PlayStation 3 to bark at me and play Blu-rays.

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,000
Brilliant idea, Jamie.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,320
After all, I mean, after looking at the iAdjudgment setup that they have at G, I think I'd rather

77
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,480
have a barking PlayStation 3 in that iAdjudgment.

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
No, no, no.

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
It wouldn't bark.

80
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,280
It would hook up to the PS3, and instead of having Nintendogs, you'd have a real dog sim

81
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,600
because you'd have your robot dog.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
So it's like Rob the Robot.

83
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,040
But only good for more than one game.

84
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,680
This is why you're on Internet radio, Jamie, and not in a boardroom.

85
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
You know what?

86
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
My idea is with some money.

87
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
People should hire me.

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,160
They need to create Rob the Robot.

89
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,360
I always wanted a miniature version of it for the DS or something like that, that would

90
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,680
sit next to your DS and do the same little thing and just re-release Gyromite or something

91
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
like that.

92
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
I think that'd be fun.

93
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,440
Well, actually, one of the good things about the iBo is it actually was a very inexpensive,

94
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:07,120
pretty, you know, interestingly complex AI in the little system that you could afford

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,080
better than a human-sized robot, and a lot of AI developers and robotics experts were

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,440
actually buying iBos for experiments.

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,800
Drunami in our chat room is suggesting that here on Orangetown's radio, we could replace

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Loki with an iBo.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
That would be cute.

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
That would be pretty fun.

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I bet the iBo is a lot cuter.

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
iBos are really cute.

103
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,440
It'd go well with my new Mac when I get it.

104
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,800
Speaking of Sony, before Loki has a chance to give a counter argument there, speaking

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,160
about Sony executives who are sitting in boardrooms eating crayons all day when they ought to

106
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,000
be working, this executive, Michael Ephraim from Sony of Australia, you know, he made

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,880
this crazy comment earlier in the week that was essentially insinuating that the Wii and

108
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,200
the 360 were too pricey.

109
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:02,320
The maker of the most expensive console for the next gen says the Wii and the 360 are

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
too pricey.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Okay, whatever.

112
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,600
Well, he further clarified his statements later in the week, but this is what he said,

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,020
quote, sorry you didn't have the opportunity to buy a PlayStation 3 this year, but I'm

114
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,240
sure it beats lining up in a queue for hours on end only to be told the store has sold

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
out.

116
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Okay.

117
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,600
No doubt in response to the delays over in Europe and some of the other countries.

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,240
So yeah, too bad you didn't have that opportunity to do that now.

119
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,100
Don't worry, your opportunity is coming soon.

120
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,080
This just goes, look, again, I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is going to be a just fine system.

121
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,240
Give it a little, it's like a fine wine, it will age just fine.

122
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,840
But Sony executives, seriously, gag order, seriously Sony, if you're listening, you

123
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,200
need all these people to STFU, you need to get a public figure that is not going to be

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,040
a laughing stock of the internet such as Reggie Miyamoto over there or Major Nelson, Peter

125
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,280
Moore over here, Sony needs somebody like that.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,760
And I'll tell you what, it's not this guy, it's not Kaz, giant enemy crab guy, who as

127
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
I hear has suffered so much embarrassment from that, he doesn't do public appearances

128
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
anymore.

129
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,360
I feel bad for him almost in a way, his boss has probably made him do that, and Kaz.

130
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,200
Oh, I'm sure they leave giant enemy crabs at his desk and stuff like that.

131
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,000
You know that game is just never going to come out now, or if it does come out, that

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,120
will be on the big sticker.

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,800
It should be one of those things like the movie Showgirls, where at this point it should

134
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,440
just be self-aware of the joke that it is now and just market itself as, hey, we're

135
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,760
that historically accurate game with the crabs.

136
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,880
That would be funny though.

137
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
Maybe they could just say the game caught crabs.

138
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,140
He goes to his doctor for a physical, I've got bad news for you.

139
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,720
You have giant enemy crabs, poor guy.

140
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,560
Anyways, yeah, but as if it wasn't bad enough, you know, that Sony is opening their mouth

141
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,640
and getting themselves in trouble, now of course they're receiving flak from the most

142
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,160
likely of places, a Microsoft blogger, whoo, anyways.

143
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,640
But this apparent Microsoft blogger was talking about their PS3 online service and saying

144
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,840
that, well, it seems to be a mishmash of online accounts, logins, services, for example, now

145
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,360
when I play a PS3 title, I simply can't depend on having a single friends list, Sony will

146
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,120
manage the master list, which should have presence in every PS3 title, and XFire will

147
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,120
be a plugin that some publishers integrate into some games, and some won't.

148
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,240
That means gamers can't depend on finding their friends in one place.

149
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,840
And he goes on talking about more other stuff and talking about how XFire is going to cost

150
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,360
money because they're, you know, licensing it and stuff, and what's that going to do

151
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,520
with the whole service and the fact that we haven't really heard much about, you know,

152
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,560
their online service and, yeah, so who knows.

153
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
So some fair, equal time type stories here.

154
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,440
Microsoft's doing some of the smack talking too.

155
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,180
Maybe should be leaving the PR to folks like Major Nelson and maybe some of the underground

156
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,800
communities, the huge Xbox fan communities out there, some of our other friendly podcasts

157
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,480
such as Gamertag and XBL, you know.

158
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,280
But there is some other interesting stuff though, and this is funny because as soon

159
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:26,840
as they, you know, ran this, that of course someone had to come to Sony's defense, and

160
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
that they did.

161
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,600
And actually, they were talking about, you know, some of the information and they also

162
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,800
posted it in their blog saying there's some bad information, you know, there responding

163
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
to the blog post.

164
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,040
That I'll get to in a sec, but it was interesting to me because it highlights some pretty core

165
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,120
differences in the approach that the PlayStation folks have taken and just kind of talking

166
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,760
about how, you know, the XFire friends list is not a replacement for the PS3 friends list

167
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,960
and that it's, you know, I don't know, it's basically Sony's, some guy named Smed.

168
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:14,960
All right, yeah, so very interesting, yeah, their online president, Smed.

169
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Okay.

170
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,720
Welcome to Sony, eat this crayon.

171
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,120
All right, look, let's go from all these smack talking executives to you guys smack talking

172
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,720
us in our mailbag.

173
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,280
No, just kidding, we haven't gotten a lot of hate mail recently, have we?

174
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Not really.

175
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Oh, that's good, that's good.

176
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm glad you guys have been nice and polite, we appreciate that.

177
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,040
You can send us an email, it's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com and every week Dark

178
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,400
Sakura suits up with her rubber gloves and his besto suit and digs in there and tries

179
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,800
to avoid the anthrax and the flames from the hate mail, of which we haven't gotten much

180
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
lately.

181
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,440
Actually, I did get anthrax lately, but it was with Public Enemy bringing the noise.

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,400
I see, but me saying, you know, we haven't gotten hate mail, you know, that just encouraged

183
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,480
like five pieces of hate mail for this week, so that should be fun.

184
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,440
We like getting the hate mail, it's fun to read.

185
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,400
Sometimes it's amusing for five seconds.

186
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, so anyway, let's read some of our email, shall we Dark Sakura?

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, send us more.

188
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Well, the first email actually comes from Orko4, basically saying that in Hickory, North

189
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,720
Carolina there was a restaurant called Tallywhacker's, me bringing up how they should make peckers

190
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,960
as a thing to hooters, and that the owner wanted the waiters to be shirtless and wearing

191
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,080
speedos but they couldn't for help violations, so they wore, you know, really tight ass shorts

192
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
and tank tops.

193
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,760
Oh yeah, I remember you talking about the mail hooters a couple weeks ago.

194
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,280
They went out of business.

195
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,880
I wonder why.

196
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,600
And the last line says, keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear the Doctor Who

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
website of the week.

198
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,040
Well, it's not Doctor Who this week, so ugh.

199
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
It's Torchwood.

200
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
That's a spin-off.

201
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,560
I see.

202
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,280
Next comes from Mike, hey, the other day I saw a Nintendo presentation on game trailers.

203
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,040
Is that how it really started off, hey!

204
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
It said hey.

205
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,480
It said suddenly it's that little fairy that follows you in The Legend of Zelda, wasn't

206
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
it, Natty?

207
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Hey, listen!

208
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Hey, listen!

209
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,480
That's how I want you all to open up your emails from now on.

210
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Hey, listen!

211
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,240
Anyway, to continue, it says that the price points for the Virtual Console 500, 700, and

212
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,320
1000 points are actually awarded as starting at points.

213
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
So does this mean that we could be paying $15 for a Nintendo 64 game?

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Just wanted to hear your thoughts.

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Possibly.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We'll see.

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
I went through behind him.

218
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,960
You know what I was just thinking about, though?

219
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,240
If Ocarina of Time does come to Virtual Console, why would I get that?

220
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,520
Because I have the little GameCube disc that had it on there, so.

221
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,400
Yeah, that was a limited release, so.

222
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Yeah, whatever.

223
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,640
I thought the Nintendo 64 was going to be $10.

224
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:01,240
I thought it was $5 for NES, $8 for Super Nintendo, $10 for Nintendo 64.

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah.

226
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Oh.

227
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Okay.

228
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Another email from Michael.

229
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,520
It says, hey, Skyloki and DarkSakura and maybe Drudami, who is not here tonight.

230
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
He's in our chat.

231
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Stop that.

232
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Stop what?

233
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,640
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

234
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,320
Rob, only you can see this.

235
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,760
Oh, look, you can see it, too.

236
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
But it's aimed toward you.

237
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
I see.

238
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Thank you.

239
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Is that your IQ?

240
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
One?

241
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
No.

242
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Mail?

243
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Email?

244
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,160
First off, I'd like to say that I love your show.

245
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Thank you.

246
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,480
And I've been listening on the podcast stream for a year and a few months, and I most recently

247
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,240
listened live last week.

248
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:50,200
Speaking of which, I was the one who called in and hung up Tassete Purim, I guess I said

249
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
that.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I think it's Latin.

251
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I didn't take Latin.

252
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Sorry.

253
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,800
I think he's actually renamed himself in chat to just call me Mike.

254
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,200
So we'll call him Mike.

255
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Hi, Mike.

256
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Sorry about that.

257
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,840
I forgot to mute the live stream while using Skype.

258
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Oops.

259
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,800
Anyway, earlier on Xbox, what's up with me?

260
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,840
On episode 203, sports games came up.

261
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,600
Most of the hosts on OLR aren't sports games fans.

262
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
You said that sports games are just a roster update.

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,280
Well, the same can be said about music games.

264
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,080
Sure, games like DDR have a few very marginal new innovations, but for the most part, the

265
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,480
games are just the same damn thing with new music.

266
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,720
And to some idiotic gamers, they just hear weird Japanese techno and they think it's

267
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
the same damn thing with the same music and a new number after the title.

268
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,400
While I disagree with both arguments, I think that both make a valid point.

269
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,880
So here's my call to the game developers and producers.

270
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,840
Don't make a new game until it's ready.

271
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,080
Sure, your game can have all the songs or players in the world, but don't put it out

272
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,560
until it is better than its predecessor.

273
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,800
That's exactly what they're doing at 3D Realms.

274
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
What?

275
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,280
It took Nukem forever.

276
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,100
They're making sure that it's ready.

277
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Is email done?

278
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
No.

279
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Okay.

280
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,420
Because I want to say something, but go ahead.

281
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,460
This goes for all games, not just music or sports games.

282
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,600
Take the Halo franchise, for example.

283
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,860
Halo 1, a masterpiece.

284
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,800
Halo 2, an Unreal Tournament skin.

285
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,240
Don't get me wrong, I play Halo 2 almost exclusively.

286
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,600
Halo 2 was pushed out the door too quickly and just for live experience.

287
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,220
Halo 2 was an unsatisfying game that could have been even better than the original.

288
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,560
Then the master of re-releasing a game, whether it needs to be or not.

289
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Metal Slug.

290
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,600
I love Metal Slug.

291
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
It rocks.

292
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,080
But when it's been pushed toward me on every available medium with no new features, it

293
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,280
makes me never want to buy a Metal Slug game again, even if it has every feature in the

294
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
world.

295
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,880
I love Metal Slug.

296
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,920
Anyway.

297
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,600
Game developers need to realize something.

298
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,120
Sure, you release the sequel to a good game, it sells well.

299
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,140
But what if you want to make it a trilogy?

300
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,500
Is it accepted?

301
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,820
Or is it looked on as milking the franchise?

302
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,240
It makes sense in the short term, but in one of the worst options in the long run.

303
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,600
Soon gamers will get smart and realize they are being scammed by buying the same game

304
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
every year.

305
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,520
I've been trying to tell this to anyone who will listen, sadly I think it's too late.

306
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,640
PS, sorry if I'm sending you this email again, it's to the first one.

307
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,440
Oh, yeah, I didn't get the first one, sorry.

308
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,720
Okay, I thought it was a pretty clever comparison, the whole roster update versus the music games,

309
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,000
but I think for that it really depends on what you're into.

310
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,200
I don't hate sports games, I just recognize that that's not what I'm into, you know?

311
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,080
And I'm sure for most of them, maybe dance games isn't really what they're into, and

312
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,160
so they wouldn't recognize the fact that the new dance games do go through interface upgrades

313
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,160
and usually there's a new mode in them somewhere, and certainly the entire list of songs gets

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,080
refreshed with, in the beginning there were quite a few carryovers, but in the more recent

315
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,120
mixes, there's been very few carryovers, and so on and so on.

316
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,760
I'm not going to bore you to death with the comparisons, but it's an interesting analogy,

317
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,200
but I think us being fans of dance games, we don't see that, you or other sports games

318
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,360
fans being fans of sports games, you don't see that either, that the rest of us just

319
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,720
see the roster update or whatever.

320
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,540
Well, actually I think it's exactly the same thing, the fact that neither of the games

321
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:24,520
have huge improvements, granted sports games go through graphical improvements and roster

322
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,340
updates, but this is even coming from people reviewing the brand new EA lineup or whatever

323
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,340
that they aren't really adding anything new and it really just is a roster update.

324
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:41,100
But that's something that they need to improve in both dance games and sports games and probably

325
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:50,960
a lot of other games, like God of War 2, that looks like an update to God of War 1, a lot

326
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,360
of games are like that nowadays.

327
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,280
Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room has an interesting point, roster updates don't really change

328
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,920
the gameplay all too much.

329
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,760
New music and music games do change gameplay a bit.

330
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,380
You have to learn new steps and that sort to the new songs.

331
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:12,460
You don't really change much for roster updates, but even the sports games do get some new

332
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,700
modes for their respective games just once in a while, just like the dance games.

333
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,400
For instance, we know that in the new Xbox ones we're going to have the non-stop mixes,

334
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
things like that.

335
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Alright, that's my thoughts.

336
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:33,080
Well, we also got another email from Rini and it's a fairly long one, so just to sort

337
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:41,200
of paraphrase of it, it's going into more innovation in the DDR series of games, but

338
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
I'm going to start from here.

339
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,680
Actually, I want to read the first one just because it was really nice.

340
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,920
Good day to OLR and happy belated episode 203.

341
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,320
May you have another 396 more at this point and beyond.

342
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,320
That was really sweet, thank you.

343
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,280
So to continue on toward the middle part of this letter, there was some discussion going

344
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,360
on in the Air and in Japan and DDR UK forums that was started to see what users had in

345
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,360
mind for some realistic and reasonable feature additions that could be added to DDR.

346
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll try to make things brisk with a few suggestions made by the community.

347
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,900
Preview background mode and steps at the song wheel and maybe at the modifier screen.

348
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,640
Challenge steps for every song in the sense that they would not only give something for

349
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,200
expert players, but would also bring out the full potential of the song according to Konami

350
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,140
so that we don't have the boring as hell licenses from the arcade supernova that has gaps of

351
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,440
nothing for no reason.

352
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,920
Wave break 0.25 and half speed, why hasn't Konami put these in?

353
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,320
If UltraMix 3 allows 0.5 speed and Phantom modifiers, then why can't the PS2 versions

354
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,920
have them?

355
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:49,060
Custom courses set on a home version can be used at the arcade with the ability to include

356
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,760
any song available on the arcade machine.

357
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,200
Also should have a maximum of four songs on nonstop mode and allow modifiers and a max

358
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,640
of five songs on challenge mode that disallows modifiers for these courses.

359
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,560
Trade edit data online and at the arcade, submit arcade score data online through a

360
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,440
home version by way of memory card.

361
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,320
Those are some good suggestions.

362
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,200
They are good suggestions and certainly we've thought through the show, many years we've

363
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,840
been doing the show, a lot of you guys when you've called in said very similar things.

364
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,640
Keep in mind that another thing that maybe goes along with the last email, the whole

365
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,080
roster updates, something Konami seems to be doing with the DDR is that they really

366
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,040
try to make each one its own separate thing.

367
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,800
The Xbox DDRs and the PlayStation 2 DDRs are really separate, they're their own different

368
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
things.

369
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,000
It's interesting to see where the arcade versions fit in now with the whole...

370
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,520
I think Supernova for me feels more like a, is there a market for DDR again?

371
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I don't know.

372
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,560
If Supernova is successful, I would think that maybe we're going to get another arcade

373
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
release.

374
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
I don't know.

375
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I think either way it's inevitable.

376
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,800
We're going to see Supernova 2 or something like that next year because with the leftover

377
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,200
songs that you didn't get from the arcade this year at least, but we'll see.

378
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,680
I am going to put this one up on our site, but there is though a last paragraph on here.

379
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:13,820
By the way, the emails that I post are going to be on the live show discussion area on

380
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
our forums.

381
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,920
It says Implayboy can just get the fuck out with their pathetic excuse of a video game

382
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
related centerfold.

383
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,280
All the artistic offerings out there read hentai, beat the shit they have easily and

384
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,440
for free, although it is commendable that they get CG nudity, right?

385
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
P.S.

386
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
More goddamn ferret.

387
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,920
I actually heard that the CG nudity on it looked pretty crappy.

388
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,160
I did look at the final thing, well the final one that was post-ed, censored of course.

389
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,520
It wasn't that great.

390
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:49,560
Well it's Fake Boobs Implayboy, which is kind of a, you know, it's like money at the bank.

391
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Exactly.

392
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,080
Well, to continue, the next one comes from JeremyTod1.

393
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,240
First off, you probably already got a couple of emails on the subject and probably aren't

394
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,920
even going to talk about it on the show, but here's my email.

395
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,280
O.L.R.'s enemy, G4, is finally mostly gone.

396
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Yes, I know the words G4 are banned from O.L.R., but for now we might not need to talk about

397
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,400
them much anymore.

398
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,520
This is all I'm going to say on this because you're right, those words are banned from

399
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,160
this network.

400
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,680
I think a lot of people are saying it's definitely the doom and gloom of the network.

401
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,400
I think it's more the doom and gloom of the network as a gaming network because it's being

402
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,520
merged in with E-Networks, which also runs like the Style Channel and some other channels.

403
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,080
That doesn't mean the station's gone or merged into E yet, although I think that may be a

404
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,760
foregone conclusion that happens in the future.

405
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,840
But don't expect any gaming content outside of X-Play, but this is not news again.

406
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,000
That channel has not been a gaming channel for the past 18 months.

407
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,380
Where have you been?

408
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,720
This is still not news.

409
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
So what?

410
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,260
They're doing a corporate restructuring around there.

411
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,880
It's not going to save them.

412
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,760
Flush that shit down the toilet and be done with it.

413
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,240
There is a quote on here, though, that I knew it from the get-go.

414
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,940
I do agree with the vision.

415
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,800
This is actually a quote from the Ian-style chief, Ted Harbert.

416
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,960
I do agree with the vision of going after young men more than going after gaming.

417
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
Gaming has been demonstrated as being too narrow.

418
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Narrow my ass!

419
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,080
There are a lot of gamers out there.

420
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,480
Text email, please.

421
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,840
No offense to the men listening and the men in the room, but stupid men.

422
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Anyway.

423
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Well.

424
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,920
I didn't mean you guys.

425
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,920
You guys are fairly liberated in your mental states, and so are our listeners.

426
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Kisses.

427
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Is that all the email?

428
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
No!

429
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Well, then get to the next one.

430
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
We're out of time here.

431
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Yeah, my voice is running out.

432
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,840
Hey, O-L-R. This, by the way, comes from Kenji.

433
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,600
So I just picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and I cannot emphasize this enough.

434
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,680
It is definitely a must-buy if you've got to hook up to the Wi-Fi connection.

435
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,020
Even though the bowling physics are awful, you can't go all-in, and you can bet yourself

436
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,960
out of a negative chip score.

437
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,080
Playing nine-ball is similar to playing the game underwater or in space.

438
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Take your pick.

439
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,240
You can't deny the infinite replayability of this game.

440
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,860
Also, you can pick to chat via Wi-Fi.

441
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,120
It can only be, however, on matches with your friends, and, of course, you can pick to via

442
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,560
local wireless play and chat with your present messages on WorldFi Wi-Fi.

443
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,400
So DMN lied to us last week?

444
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,480
Of course, he had the game before most people.

445
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,320
He had the game before most people, so he probably didn't have friends on Wi-Fi yet,

446
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
so that makes sense.

447
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,320
That makes me want to buy the game, though.

448
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Why?

449
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Dirty Wi-Fi.

450
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Dirty Wi-Fi chat?

451
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Yeah.

452
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
That would be fun.

453
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,960
Anyway, it is because of the awesomeness of this game that I come to you with a request,

454
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
nay, a favor.

455
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,120
I wanted to make an OLR Clubhouse games night where we all exchange friend codes, make a

456
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,720
date and time, and basically play the night away.

457
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,080
Perhaps you'd all like to participate, you being Jamie, Sky, and Loki, and you also being

458
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,120
the rest of the people listening.

459
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,000
At long last, pick to chatting, drop 4 biatch can become a reality, but only with your help.

460
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,880
I've left a post in the forums for anyone who's interested, as I always love the show.

461
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Kenji?

462
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Just so you know, I did see that post earlier in the week, and I actually just moved it

463
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,080
to the OL Army forums because it's kind of fit a little more with that because we try

464
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,760
to create teams in certain games that will follow the cardinal rule of the OL Army is

465
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,320
don't be a dick.

466
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,000
So we just want people to join up that just want to have fun and not try to have that

467
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,080
elitist attitude or like, you know, my plus four sword can be your plus two, you know,

468
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
who cares?

469
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
Get in the game and have fun with it.

470
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,600
Put your plus four sword in your pants.

471
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
That's exactly right.

472
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,120
So I actually moved that post over to the OL Army and I posted my code there.

473
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,480
So if you want to add that would be cool and certainly we could set up a night for gaming.

474
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,880
Maybe it could be a tie in with one of the live shows that we do during the week because

475
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,880
a lot of people don't know there's shows we do on Orange Launch Radio, but we don't podcast

476
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,300
because, you know, we like to be a live radio network.

477
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,960
So Dark Sakura has her thing on Tuesdays and I have a show on Wednesdays and there may

478
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,800
be more shows coming soon.

479
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,620
We know Loki's got something in the works and there's something else I'm trying to get

480
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
on board.

481
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
We'll see.

482
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,800
We're coming from GS 191, we got a really long email, but I thought it was very cool

483
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,920
and have posted it on that thread that I mentioned prior on there.

484
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,120
So I'd love to get some discussion started up on that.

485
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
I will.

486
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,800
The other emails that I was going to post up to will be coming.

487
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,480
It's just been, like I said, I've had a sinus infection the last week, so I haven't really

488
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
done much of anything.

489
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Excuses, excuses.

490
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
I'm kidding.

491
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,960
Would you like the sinus infection?

492
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Not really.

493
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,260
I would love to see you on erythromycin.

494
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
Not really.

495
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Okay.

496
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,780
Not erythromycin.

497
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,080
Just a, you know, he who shall not be named.

498
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Anything else for emails?

499
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Yes.

500
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,120
God damn, we got a lot of emails this week.

501
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
They love us.

502
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
One more.

503
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Last email.

504
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
We got to keep moving.

505
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Yes.

506
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
This is the one that came on through MySpace.

507
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Ah, okay.

508
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Yes.

509
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
I remember this one.

510
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
This is a MySpace message.

511
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Gally from Breakdown Radio.

512
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Mm-hmm.

513
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Hey guys, Gally here from the Breakdown.

514
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm a big fan of the show and you guys rock swords big time.

515
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,260
Sorry I didn't send this to your mailbag, but I think being yelled at by the boss right

516
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,600
now, damn the man.

517
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,160
Anyway, with all this talk of the Wii 60 going down, do you guys think it's a smart move

518
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
on a personal level?

519
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,180
Do you guys already have 360s, but try and look at it from the perspective of a gamer

520
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,960
who has neither yet?

521
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,800
Do you think it would be a wise move to do the Wii 60, stick with one of the two, or

522
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,200
is the last alternative, which I highly doubt because of Sakura's crayon eating references,

523
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,360
holding out for the PS3?

524
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,520
It seems a lot of gamers out there face that dilemma and we've been thinking this question

525
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
a lot from our listeners.

526
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm sorry, we've been getting this question a lot from our listeners and peers.

527
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,640
So what do you think?

528
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,840
Okay, DarkSakura, please remind our listeners of the golden rule of gaming.

529
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,520
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

530
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,400
Yes, and this is why I have her bring this up because it's really about what you want

531
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,160
out of this next generation of gaming.

532
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,860
If you're rich and are really into gaming and want to buy all three systems, hey, go

533
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
for it.

534
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
Get them all.

535
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,780
But if you are not rich and you only have the choice, you know, do I want to get a PS3

536
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,960
or do I want to do the Wii 60 thing, or hell, can I really only pick one of these?

537
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,240
You know, you really have to consider what games do you want to play.

538
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,960
And I think especially right now between Wii and Xbox 360, there's vastly different games

539
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,060
available on the two systems, so you really have to ask yourself, am I wanting to do the

540
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:29,200
wavy controller, Elibits, Zelda, WarioWare type of game, or do I want to get online and

541
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,720
play Gears of War and soon Halo 3 and maybe some, you know, games like Enchanted Arms

542
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,820
or NFL NBA type games that are available on Xbox 360?

543
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,800
You really have to consider.

544
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,320
And then the way PlayStation 3 works into it is that, you know, even though a lot of

545
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,000
games that, you know, we're hearing are kind of the same things we saw on Xbox 360, i.e.

546
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,640
Oblivion and so on, they are going to have their own games eventually that stand out.

547
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,600
My personal mindset is that you don't need to get a PlayStation 3 right out the gate,

548
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,960
but I say that because for me, there's no games on this yet that I have to have.

549
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,700
A year from now, I'm probably going to feel a lot differently.

550
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,600
By the time Final Fantasy 13, Metal Gear Solid 4 start hitting the market, you know what,

551
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,840
I'm probably going to be Sony fanboy all over again.

552
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,500
But as far as the launch goes, I'm not really sold.

553
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,780
So if you think you're going to have some money now and then more money in a year and

554
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,500
PlayStation 3 doesn't have the lineup for you right now, do what I'm doing.

555
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,880
Buy the Wii now so you have your Wii 6, because I bought the Xbox 360, you know, six months

556
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
ago so, you know, it's spaced out enough where this isn't a huge financial impact.

557
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,320
Buy the Wii when it comes out and then buy the PlayStation 3 later down the line.

558
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,960
But, you know, again, it's up to you and what games you want to play.

559
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,840
And there's no real clear answer we can give.

560
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,920
We can only tell you based on what we play.

561
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,780
But there's going to be Sony fanboys that say, no, you have to have one of these on

562
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:53,240
launch because you have to have Lair and Warhawk and Sixaxis for life and yadda, yadda, yadda.

563
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,680
But it's all about what you want.

564
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:01,360
Well, from my perspective, I'm getting them all anyway, so...

565
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,320
I'd say if you can get them all, get them all.

566
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,560
That way you're not limited.

567
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,080
ActDeaf says, I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'll get a 360 just to play

568
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,940
UNO.

569
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,200
You might be being sarcastic, but you're really wasting your time if that's all you want because

570
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,480
you can play it for free on Zone MSN, or, hell, Clubhouse Games has something just like

571
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
it.

572
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,600
So, if now you must have strip UNO with the webcam, well, I suppose a 360 is the only

573
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
place you could do that.

574
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I don't know.

575
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,960
Rama says PlayStation 3 will be bringing it back to the store after it breaks in 20 minutes.

576
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,520
Hey, you know what?

577
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,880
That's something to be said too.

578
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,360
Maybe you don't want to get a first generation worth of console.

579
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,320
I learned my lesson with the Xbox 360.

580
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,840
Go back and listen to some episodes around February when I bought my Xbox 360.

581
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,280
The damn thing broke when I bought it, and I was pissed, and I was going to go torch

582
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,200
down Microsoft, but since then they fixed it for free, and I've been a happy boy.

583
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,560
I did also want to make an announcement, though, for Pump Up the Volume, actually, this week.

584
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Your Tuesday show.

585
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Yes.

586
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Yes.

587
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Excuse me.

588
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
There will be a delay on the show.

589
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,680
It will be starting around 730 to 8 this week.

590
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,320
I just wanted to go ahead and make a mention of that.

591
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,840
I am doing it.

592
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
All right.

593
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,080
Let's go ahead and listen to the other live programming on Orange Launch Radio.

594
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,800
All done with the mailbag?

595
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Yeah.

596
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Okay.

597
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,240
Moving on to more gaming news.

598
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,960
There is a movie called 8-Bit under development.

599
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,840
According to VH1's Game Break, quote, this movie is about how games affect our culture,

600
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,820
how the genre crosses the culture to influence music, art, and the way we think.

601
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,160
In 8-Bit, artists invade the online shooter Counter-Strike to add messages of peace on

602
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,580
walls with paintball guns if they don't get shot first.

603
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,640
In 8-Bit, people make compelling trance club and even pop-focus music using old Game Boys.

604
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,200
In 8-Bit, artists Mary Flanagan's take the software from Unreal Tournament 2003 to make

605
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,560
Domestik, a memorous world in which she tells a story about how her father was trapped in

606
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,320
the family's house during a fire.

607
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,400
It's amazing stuff all the way around.

608
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Huh.

609
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Sounds kind of artsy.

610
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,920
That might be interesting.

611
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,480
It's kind of weird that I've never heard of any of this stuff.

612
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,140
Well, I mean, I've heard of the music, certainly.

613
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,040
We know a lot of those bands, but I haven't heard of any of those other art projects,

614
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,200
so that might be worth checking out.

615
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I've heard of the Game Boy one.

616
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Really?

617
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Well, yeah, yeah.

618
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
The Game Boy music one.

619
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Yeah.

620
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
We've also had bands that use the type of...

621
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah.

622
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,680
I'm talking about like the Counter-Strike, Grandpa and the fire thing and the whole...

623
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Those sort of things.

624
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
I've never heard of that before.

625
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,440
That might be interesting.

626
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,320
Bringing paintballs into a wall does not make for a winning team, but it's an interesting

627
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,160
kind of art form when it's done in a game, huh?

628
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Maybe?

629
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Yeah.

630
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,040
It's very unique, but it's also kind of neat, and one of the rumors that's going to be coming

631
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,960
soon, and you might actually be able to watch 8-bit on this, that Microsoft might be adding

632
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,040
XVID and DivX support to the 360 in the fall dashboard update.

633
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:08,680
Now, no idea whether it's true or not, but the news actually comes from a developers

634
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,720
conference that was going on, actually.

635
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:23,920
Some Dutch colleagues from xLife.nl were invited to a training session for shop employees and

636
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,920
basically kind of just talking a little bit about technology and stuff.

637
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,200
One of the questions that was asked, basically at the event, they had a talk with the host

638
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,000
and asked them whether it was going to be DivX or XVID support in the future or other

639
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,160
codecs, and he said that it was something that Microsoft was working hard to implement,

640
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,320
and a firmware update is expected within two months.

641
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
We'll have to see.

642
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,360
That might be a rumor for now, but it would make sense if they supported something like

643
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
that.

644
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,100
I don't know if they will, though.

645
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:04,400
Something that's not a rumor is a new multiplayer mode for Red Steel is going to be called Killer

646
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Mode.

647
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:12,320
It's a special multiplayer setup, so you'll use your mission brief via the speaker and

648
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
the Wiimote.

649
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:21,360
I was hearing something about this, that basically, I think the Wiimote is supposed to ring, and

650
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,160
so you put it up to your ear and it'll actually whisper like, you know...

651
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
This is Snake.

652
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,640
This isn't like, you need to kill player four and do not kill the other players or something

653
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
like that.

654
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,520
It gives you your mission in a little speaker so the other people don't know what your mission

655
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
is.

656
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
That's pretty cool.

657
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
That is damn innovative, isn't it?

658
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
That's pretty fun.

659
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
I like that.

660
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
That is pretty cool.

661
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
That's innovation.

662
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,100
I like that.

663
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,960
This might be innovative as well for the Wii.

664
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,140
The Wii might just be this system of innovation.

665
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,020
That's certainly the direction that Nintendo wanted to go in, whether the public is open

666
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,240
to that or not.

667
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,440
I'm not quite sure.

668
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,920
The rumor is that a Wii is going to go into digital distribution in 2007.

669
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,520
What they're actually doing, they're talking about service, I think it's going to be very

670
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,840
similar to Xbox Live Arcade, and they kind of touched on this a little bit during E3,

671
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:24,640
saying that they're going to be helping finance certain smaller games for the Wii marketplace.

672
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,040
This I think is going to be very similar to that.

673
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,920
They're going to be talking a little bit more about releasing games.

674
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,880
You see some of the stuff, not necessarily old games on Xbox Live Arcade, but newer games

675
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,520
that are small made for that kind of setup.

676
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,760
I don't see this really replacing the current distribution we have now, but it's interesting

677
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,160
because you've heard a lot of talk about this whole digital distribution moving on into

678
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,440
the next gaming area, especially on PlayStation 3 as well.

679
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
There's a quote here.

680
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,840
Let me read this real fast.

681
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,600
This is from, I believe this is from Nintendo themselves.

682
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,060
Beginning in spring 2007, Nintendo will apparently begin the Wii Compact software line of games

683
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,600
which will allow players to download certain Wii titles to their console rather than purchasing

684
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
a disc.

685
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,120
Pricing and storage details as well as what software will be made available, not provided.

686
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,140
Yeah, it's going to be very interesting on the storage details because it doesn't really

687
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,040
have much storage in that system, only 512.

688
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,840
I'm sure there will be an external.

689
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,120
If there's a peripheral to be made, Nintendo's on it.

690
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
Definitely.

691
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,880
It was actually kind of interesting.

692
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,880
They had some pics from the new peripherals that were announced for Japan, and we got

693
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,640
to see a picture of the Ethernet adapter for the Wii.

694
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:40,040
It's just USB Ethernet, which is kind of cool, and new cables and whatnot.

695
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:46,080
So, anyways, there's some interesting stuff also coming out about the Wii, and I know

696
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,600
one of the stories that was run during the week when talking about how sunlight was causing

697
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,320
a problem with the Wiim remotes, where it was interfering with the IR field that the

698
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,040
actual receiver and emitters were putting out.

699
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,640
Well, apparently, Nintendo has commented on that, and they said that it's not a major

700
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
issue.

701
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,040
It says, our testing thus far shows no great risk of light interference while playing a

702
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,580
game that relies on the pointer and sensor bar.

703
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,600
And so, granted, that's going to be about as much interference as having a bright light

704
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,840
shining on your TV or something like that, that won't really interfere with it.

705
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,280
I'm kind of on the fence with this.

706
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,400
I guess we'll have to see when it comes out.

707
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
But you know what, though?

708
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,000
If there's anything to be learned from this, especially from the iToy and from the Xbox

709
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,080
Live Vision camera, my house is always too dark, so I don't think too much light is ever

710
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
going to be a problem.

711
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,160
She serves the internet up and down and left and right, and finds a website that she finds

712
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,360
worthy of sharing with you all.

713
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,880
It's called her Website of the Week, and here it is.

714
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,760
This Website of the Week was actually one given to me by our dear friend and listener,

715
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,360
Rob with Two Bees, and I'll spell it out.

716
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:42,200
It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com, which is for the Entertainment Consumers Association, which

717
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,000
is actually very cool.

718
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,480
To read this little blurb from their website, the Entertainment Consumers Association is

719
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,800
a non-profit membership organization established to serve the needs of those who play computer

720
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
and video games.

721
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,520
Formed in 2006, the ECA is an advocacy organization for consumers of interactive entertainment.

722
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,080
You can actually sign up for their site.

723
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,160
They have things to win.

724
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,680
They also have lots of information, links to game politics, too.

725
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,080
It seems that there's a little bit of an affiliation there.

726
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,480
Lots of really good stuff, FAQs, news, just things that are going on as far as our legal

727
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,800
rights as gamers.

728
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,960
In fact, there's another blurb on here.

729
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,120
It says, today more than ever before, gamers need to stand together to defend against political

730
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,780
activity that is threatening the creation and publishing of video games.

731
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,500
On behalf of the gaming community, the ECA lobbies legislators directly as well as launching

732
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,160
grassroots digital initiatives to preserve our rights as gamers.

733
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
What was that link again?

734
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,900
It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com.

735
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Check it out, boys and girls.

736
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
Definitely.

737
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,560
I'll be linking it in the chat room.

738
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,480
GameTap is a service we've mentioned a few times on this show.

739
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,880
It's still getting a little steam, a few more subscribers every now and then.

740
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,120
They have launched a 500 player beta of Uru Live, which you might know also as the missed

741
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,800
online project.

742
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,680
This is a pretty big deal because what happened is the project was abandoned and then GameTap

743
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,680
has kind of picked it up and ran with it, so it's kind of interesting.

744
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,440
Gay Gamer recently ran a report on this and they said this, quote, GameTap has improved

745
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,000
the game with new sound support and a new physics engine that makes it much easier and

746
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,880
faster to interact with others, something that bogged down the original game.

747
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,480
As things go as planned, Uru Live may begin to incorporate content generated by its incredibly

748
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,080
creative player community.

749
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Interesting.

750
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
That's pretty cool.

751
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,640
I hope they keep doing more stuff like that, supporting smaller games, maybe helping some

752
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,520
PC games get published and stuff like that.

753
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,720
I think what's kind of neat about that, too, is that you're paying essentially the GameTap

754
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,120
fee for access to all this, so if they get more MMOs, it's kind of like you're paying

755
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,320
one fee for all these MMOs, and GameTap is relatively cheap.

756
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,160
It's the same price they're charging for Phantasy Star Universe, in a way.

757
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,600
I don't want to sound like a commercial because I've already been accused of being on their

758
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
payroll.

759
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,840
No, I actually pay the $10 a month for GameTap, which is sad because I rarely ever use it

760
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,540
because I check it out once every other week or so to see what's new.

761
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,640
This is something I definitely will check out.

762
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
I'm very curious.

763
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,600
Obviously, I can't get it in the beta, but when it's released.

764
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:28,500
This week, Unfettered Blather, a blogging site, actually ran a top ten list of the top

765
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,800
ten things about next-gen that are annoying.

766
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,840
Let's go off the list here.

767
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,040
Big highlights, of course.

768
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,200
Number one, Sony's alternate reality.

769
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,520
No matter how you spin it, we just want a game console first.

770
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,300
Go push your format war somewhere else.

771
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,080
Number two, dual-price skew nonsense with the new next-gen console.

772
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,580
You know what, though?

773
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,120
If you read those stories about people who are pre-ordering the PS3, some of them were

774
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,040
doing it because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.

775
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,560
I don't know if number one has as much validity as people think.

776
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
I don't know.

777
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,200
Anyways, cost between consoles and computers vanishing.

778
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,200
$60 games, expensive peripherals, consoles being released at $600 price points.

779
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,520
Chasing Nintendo, since you just can't ignore the changes in industry, but sure fun watching

780
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,920
these two mega-corporations scramble to keep up with Nintendo's ideas.

781
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,040
And other fun stuff, they're also on there, mainly repeating the $60 game thing and name

782
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,120
changes like they're saying the revolution was a better name and stuff like that.

783
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,440
That $60 game thing should have been number one.

784
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,500
That's the most annoying, if anything.

785
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Come on.

786
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
$60 bucks.

787
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,080
My game would have made my list.

788
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah, we haven't really seen it.

789
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,020
That whole Gran Turismo thing, though, I don't think we've really seen what exactly

790
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,600
is going to come of that, you know what I mean?

791
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Interesting.

792
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
All right.

793
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,360
Well, if you have more annoying things, you could maybe write this guy and maybe he'll

794
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,880
do an extended list in the future.

795
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,840
Well, in other news, in regards to, we had brought up there was going to be a Castlevania

796
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
movie, right?

797
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,960
Well, it's going to be written by Warren Ellis.

798
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Pretty cool, huh?

799
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,600
But also, it is going to be direct to DVD.

800
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,640
I don't know.

801
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,400
Direct to DVD, that's not good.

802
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,080
There have been some good things put direct to DVD.

803
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,680
Well, it kind of seems to be one place the movie industry is going.

804
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,400
You have all these god-awful sequels going direct to DVD.

805
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,440
Why not something kind of new, unique, unless you saw Van Helsing, which was kind of Castlevania

806
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,200
the movie in a way.

807
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Not really.

808
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Just kidding.

809
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,320
At any rate, there's a quote on here saying, for an entity currently known only as Project

810
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:50,800
51 Productions, a production blog will follow on the official site.

811
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,640
We just keep our eyes on it to see what happens.

812
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,640
All right.

813
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,360
Well, I'm looking for it.

814
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
I'll rent it.

815
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,760
I'll put it in my Netflix queue.

816
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,480
Having him write it, that's like a fan-gasm right there.

817
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
I don't know.

818
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,520
By the way, it is the animated Castlevania thing that we were talking about before.

819
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,220
So animated movie, that wouldn't be too bad, I guess, and this is not live action.

820
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,880
After all, they are making BloodRayne 2.

821
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,600
I mean, god, do we really need more video game movies like that, but I don't know.

822
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,240
It should be pretty cool.

823
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,720
Okay, here we go.

824
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,520
He basically was a comic writer.

825
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,440
I actually did remember that he did work for Excalibur because I read Excalibur from its

826
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:39,440
beginning incarnation and on, did DV8, which was a Gen 13 spinoff, Stormwatch.

827
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,960
The Authority did some stuff for Vertigo, Transmetropolitan was one.

828
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:55,080
Also was working on the Counter-X line of titles for Marvel, as in Generation X, X-Man,

829
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:04,960
X-Force, and is also working on Avatar comics, Homage comics, lots of different comic stuff.

830
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,160
I just had to pull up the list.

831
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,000
I knew Excalibur off the top of my head.

832
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,880
Comic fan-gasm for those folks that are looking forward to the Castlevania movie.

833
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,000
I always remembered the Excalibur stuff, but I knew he did a whole bunch of other things

834
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
too.

835
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,720
Well, another animated thing that's very popular is South Park, and of course, a couple of

836
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,320
weeks ago, they had the Wow episode.

837
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,360
Well, man, you should have kept a tab on Wikipedia because people just started coming up with

838
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,360
these huge lists of things that were inconsistent in the episode.

839
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,160
I mean, obviously, these were the same guys that Matt and Trey were trying to make fun

840
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
of.

841
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,320
For instance, here's one.

842
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,780
Trailers for this episode show Stan and Kyle in what appears to be the undercity right

843
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,140
after Kenny is killed.

844
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,840
In the airing of the show, they were in Goldshire.

845
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:51,440
I mean, it's like, damn, people, get a life.

846
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,220
But I do want to point out, I watched this week's episode of South Park, and for those

847
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,480
folks that heard my review of the Wow episode of South Park last week, that satire I said

848
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,720
was missing, that was in this week's episode.

849
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,840
This week's episode of South Park was freaking hilarious.

850
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,600
I laughed my ass off, but I just have a fucked-up sense of humor.

851
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
What can I say?

852
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,200
Don't you think that they probably did that stuff on purpose or just didn't really give

853
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,200
a crap?

854
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,200
That's what they did.

855
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Ah, bathroom.

856
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,120
So then there's another wonderful rumor going around the interweb this week.

857
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,520
That would be that the sword featured in the actual episode of South Park was a real sword.

858
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:34,280
Sword of the 1000 Truths is supposed to be winnable in the arena matches in Burning Crusade.

859
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:40,240
Some people think that it's an obvious Photoshop, but who knows, I guess we'll see when Burning

860
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,440
Crusade hits stores.

861
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,960
That's kind of interesting though.

862
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,880
It actually wouldn't surprise me if that were true.

863
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,720
I actually don't think that's a fanboy thing.

864
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,960
I think that could actually be true because that episode of South Park felt like such

865
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,000
this huge infomercial, it would be the perfect tie-in.

866
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,520
Well it was funny though, because actually some of the stats were a little bit different

867
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,400
from the actual cartoon.

868
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:15,840
Of course it says 197 to 296 damage, 88 damage per second, plus 21 stamina, requires level

869
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
70.

870
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,520
It says equip improves hit rating by 8, improves critical strike rating by 14, and improves

871
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,520
your resub.

872
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,120
Why don't you go post that on Wikipedia, you damn nerd?

873
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,120
It doesn't match what was in the show.

874
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,000
No, they already posted that on Wikipedia.

875
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,600
Oh, I see.

876
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,920
So that would be interesting to see if that's going to actually be coming out.

877
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,600
Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, looks like those wow nerds during the correcting needs a clue.

878
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
I got a clue.

879
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,600
I got a raging clue.

880
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,880
My clue is over there.

881
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,880
Let's go there.

882
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Oh my, ClueGoo.

883
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,880
ClueGoo.

884
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,880
That's a raging clue.

885
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,880
I get it.

886
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,320
It's a joke about the South Park from this week.

887
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
That's funny.

888
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Good job, listeners.

889
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Good job.

890
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Geeky, geeky, geeky, geeky.

891
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,240
Yeah, well, you know what?

892
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,840
You are on an internet radio program about video games.

893
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
Hi.

894
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Hi, you're black.

895
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,560
Hey, hey, hey.

896
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,280
I calls them as I sees them, dude.

897
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:14,400
Well, you remember my allusion to the Phantom earlier in part A?

898
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Yes.

899
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,400
Aha.

900
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,400
Pay attention, listeners.

901
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,320
Well, I was giving foreshadowing.

902
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,320
Ooh.

903
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,400
Yeah, they actually are starting to sell something for Phantom.

904
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,760
Isn't that funny?

905
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,280
They have been showing off this thing called the Phantom wireless lap board and Phantom

906
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,320
wireless laser mouse.

907
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,640
The two together are basically just a way to sit on your ass and browse the internet

908
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,640
with a keyboard.

909
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:48,320
It's like Web TV, only with a swivel keyboard thing and a piece of hard plastic underneath

910
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
it.

911
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,860
So is this the next generation of gaming?

912
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,360
My ass.

913
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,920
Like I said, Web TV, we've had this shit before.

914
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,120
But I...

915
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
Hard surface.

916
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,120
Was that funny, Loki?

917
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
No, I'm sorry.

918
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:10,280
I was just reading our chat room, and Black Boy's like, I have a blue kettle.

919
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,820
My kettle's silver.

920
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,340
There was a comment made in chat room to what I had said earlier, and I asked Black Boy

921
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:19,640
if his kettle was black, and he said it's actually blue.

922
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:26,120
The Get Well Gamers Foundation, it's another nice charity that was posted about a little

923
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,760
bit earlier this week on gaygamer.net.

924
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,400
Our next step is to see that we have product donations to support our new increased capacity.

925
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,760
At the moment, we have nowhere near what is required, but given our track record of success,

926
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,080
we are confident that someone will answer the call.

927
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:45,220
With the holidays fast approaching, however, it's crucial that we receive donations as

928
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,760
soon as possible.

929
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,880
Now what is it that they're donating to?

930
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,040
Very similar to the whole Penny Arcade deal that they do, these guys help donate video

931
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,160
games and game systems and things to children.

932
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,420
So that's pretty cool.

933
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:04,980
And this is a pretty cool thing, is that you can actually donate your old games, so games

934
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,060
you might think are old and outdated and you're never going to play anymore, like instead

935
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:13,080
of throwing a Nintendo 64 in the garbage, you could donate it to a charity like this.

936
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,920
And listen, if you've watched, fucking, Mind Mancia, you would know that nobody wants

937
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,520
a Nintendo 64 anymore.

938
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,280
I would just like to point out, in this picture, on this site, there is a child, a sick child,

939
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,440
you're playing a Nintendo 64.

940
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,440
Hasn't he suffered enough?

941
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,520
He suffered an heartless bastard.

942
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,800
Hey, hey, I still love Pokemon Snap.

943
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
Me too.

944
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,320
And Mario 64 is the shit.

945
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,440
I also threw away a PlayStation.

946
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Well, I've done that.

947
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,560
I have a stack of five of them in my back room.

948
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,040
You hurtless, both of you.

949
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,040
They don't work.

950
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,040
Oh, come on.

951
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,040
If it's broken, then it's broken.

952
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:54,880
One of our old ones, it will still sort of work, you have to tilt it sideways at a 45

953
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,400
degree angle for it to read the discs right.

954
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Maybe I'll donate mine to this charity.

955
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
I don't really play my Nintendo 64.

956
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,080
My Nintendo 64 was broken, it was all blurry, and the polygons were simple.

957
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,080
See, now you're making it up.

958
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,080
Now you're just making stuff up.

959
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,880
If I'm going to play Nintendo 64, I'll play my DS.

960
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,880
Exactly.

961
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,840
Anyway, just admit you're a bad person and get to the next story.

962
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,400
I am a bad person, and I have no problem with that.

963
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,800
You're a bad, bad man.

964
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,160
Listen, if it comes, I'm getting my Wii, and I ain't donating shit.

965
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,560
That's my Wii.

966
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
You're going to-

967
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Whatever.

968
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
I'm not going to say any more.

969
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,560
Anyways-

970
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,560
You're going to get cancer.

971
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
That's just what's going to happen.

972
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,560
It's karma.

973
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
You're going to die in a fire.

974
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,560
Well, they all have a Nintendo 64 again.

975
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
The circle comes full.

976
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,280
You know you really want a 64 double D?

977
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
What?

978
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,480
I think we really need to go to the next story at this point before we get this-

979
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,560
Okay, look, we've got one foot in hell, so let's please go to the next story.

980
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:55,360
Anyways, because in hell, if you throw water on the ground, you're going to get steam.

981
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
That's my transition.

982
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,320
Because steam is getting a lot more cool games coming to it.

983
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,760
One of those games is a fan favorite, Psychonauts.

984
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,420
That's kind of neat, and of course, other things that you're going to be seeing on steam

985
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:17,120
other than Psychonauts, and Psychonauts, by the way, is just going to be about 20 bucks.

986
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,520
You're also going to see such wonderful games like Call of Duty 2, as well as some other

987
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,880
Activision titles, Call of Duty United Offensive, and Gun.

988
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,360
Those are also going to be coming, as well as the brand new game that will also be coming

989
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:38,120
to Xbox Live Arcade someday, RoboBlitz is also making its way, so lots of fun stuff

990
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
for steam.

991
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,240
They should do a game called Call of Booty.

992
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,480
Or porn.

993
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,920
You know, they have World of Porncraft.

994
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,680
They should definitely have Call of Booty.

995
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,680
Well speaking of World of...

996
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,680
You know what?

997
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
I should...

998
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,680
Okay.

999
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,320
I have this great entrepreneur idea here.

1000
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Would this sell?

1001
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,280
That we're going to share with the entire internet.

1002
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
I don't know.

1003
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Patent pending.

1004
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,280
It's mine.

1005
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
Trademarked.

1006
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
You steal this, I sue you.

1007
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,640
Okay, here it is.

1008
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:13,340
Make a porn company that does nothing but video game tie-ins like that.

1009
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,200
I think there's an audience out there for that.

1010
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,720
We could do both gay, straight, lesbo, whatever, everything, trisexual, it doesn't matter,

1011
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,160
furries, sure, we'll find something for you guys too, Pokemon or something.

1012
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,000
I believe like Banjo-Kazooie porn.

1013
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,600
Because think about it, there are movie studios that make their porns based off of movies.

1014
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,080
The first one I ever saw was called The Boneheads.

1015
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,360
The first one I ever saw was Whore of the Rings, actually that wasn't the first one.

1016
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,360
Remember Ally McPheil?

1017
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,360
That one was funny.

1018
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,920
Ally McPheil with Ron Jeremy, okay see, these porn studios make killings off of...

1019
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,520
off of TV spoofs and movie spoofs.

1020
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,520
How about video game spoofs and Final Fuck X?

1021
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,640
Who doesn't remember that one?

1022
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,320
That was a great Japanese import.

1023
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
We need some good, domestically made...

1024
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
Really good cosplay.

1025
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,360
Bring me your whores and your sluts and let's put them in some video game porn.

1026
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,100
I'll make them stars and make a lot of money in the process.

1027
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,040
Remember strippers are people too, naked people.

1028
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,680
Anyway, next story, right?

1029
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,320
Back to the world of something craft.

1030
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,540
Well, you know how everyone was all hyper about the character transfer system for World

1031
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,540
of Warcraft?

1032
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:30,280
Well, apparently it sucks a lot of ass.

1033
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:38,680
There's an article up on Kotaku that was written by someone who experienced this ass-ness firsthand.

1034
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,680
They're actually going through it saying that he offered a... what?

1035
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,320
Sorry, it's the chat room.

1036
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,560
Finish your story, then I'll go back.

1037
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,560
No, just tell me.

1038
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Because now there's...

1039
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,240
Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls, I saw that at a store last week.

1040
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,720
Now they're going off on all these movies that we could make here.

1041
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:03,260
We have DMN says Super Princess Penis, DMN says Conquers Bad Furry Day, Mantic says Crash

1042
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,600
Bandicunt, DMN says Elite Beat Off Agents.

1043
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,600
You guys are brilliant.

1044
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I love it.

1045
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,760
And Bandit says simply Paris Hilton's Gem Quest.

1046
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,560
That's practically porn anyway.

1047
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
You guys are awesome.

1048
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:22,280
Well, back to my story, our dirty-minded listeners.

1049
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,280
Chrome Horse.

1050
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,280
That was...

1051
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,280
Good one, Travis.

1052
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,280
Travis, yeah.

1053
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,280
Anyway...

1054
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Yeah, no more porn.

1055
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,280
No more porn.

1056
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Sorry.

1057
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,040
They finished the first step of the character transfer and paid everything on the credit

1058
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,240
card.

1059
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,240
They said it would take 12 hours to move it.

1060
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
They checked again.

1061
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,240
12 hours again.

1062
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,160
12 hours later, they checked again, and still another 12 hours.

1063
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,200
And people on the forums were bitching up a storm.

1064
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,680
And actually, there was a...

1065
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,640
They were basically putting the same old cut and paste response on the forum.

1066
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,640
Blah, blah, blah.

1067
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,640
This is normal.

1068
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,640
Working as intended.

1069
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,640
My butt.

1070
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,240
You know, that type of thing.

1071
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:10,200
And they said no one could resolve it by working with their customer service.

1072
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,880
It was suggested canceling the transfer and starting again, and no one else had any luck

1073
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,320
with it.

1074
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,120
So they actually checked it.

1075
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,120
Checked it.

1076
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,120
Nothing was going through.

1077
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,280
And they actually didn't bill, though, the credit card, you said, later, but there was

1078
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,680
an issue, though, with people who were using debit cards saying that the transfer would

1079
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,600
fail at the finalization stage and charge the account 20 euros for each failed attempt.

1080
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,400
And it was redoing it over and over and over.

1081
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,040
So they encouraged them to retry it, yet it was withdrawing 20 euros every time.

1082
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,320
It looks like it was retrying it on its own.

1083
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,320
Oh, nice.

1084
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:57,260
So it wasn't charging credit cards, like I said, but it was charging debit accounts and

1085
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,120
draining people's bank accounts.

1086
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:10,960
So Blizzard hasn't worked for about eight days, and Blizzard finally came out and said

1087
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
something about it.

1088
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,680
But there has not been a statement issued by Blizzard.

1089
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,780
There hasn't been an ETA as to when they're going to get that fixed.

1090
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:26,200
As I understand it, though, this is only screwing over the euro banks, not American transfers.

1091
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:34,480
That's what I'm seeing right here, but they can't just be so closed-mouthed about this.

1092
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,560
They have to be ford with it.

1093
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,800
They're going to lose so much freaking business.

1094
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,060
On top of that, there's any type of number of suits that are going to come up over just

1095
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,880
how much money they've taken from these bank accounts.

1096
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,360
They've really screwed themselves with this.

1097
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,040
When you see it happening, you stop the service.

1098
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,600
You do it right then.

1099
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,680
It's just ridiculous.

1100
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,720
Not cool, not cool.

1101
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,240
Hopefully there will be some type of compensation or free time given.

1102
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,240
No free time.

1103
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,240
They have to give these people their money back.

1104
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,140
Well, that too, obviously, but something else for their troubles.

1105
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,320
It's no fun having a dry bank account for a few days.

1106
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,200
Trust me, I've been there.

1107
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:20,320
At least the banks have been freezing the accounts that are in question.

1108
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
That's good.

1109
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:26,160
Dark Sakura, would you watch a movie called Select Caliber 3?

1110
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,680
Hell yeah!

1111
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,240
Black Boy says, Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll.

1112
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,240
That sounds fun.

1113
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,440
I thought there was a game, Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll.

1114
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,640
Yeah, but it could be a porn too.

1115
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,240
Sorry, I promised we wouldn't do any more of the porn, but some of them are just so

1116
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,240
damn funny.

1117
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,240
What can I say?

1118
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,280
Skype line's open.

1119
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,280
You can call us.

1120
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,640
Go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1121
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,800
Click on interact with us.

1122
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,960
The user name is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can pick up the telephone and call, 916-226-9067.

1123
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,360
In the meantime, some quick last minute stories, some things to squeeze in there.

1124
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,260
I did want to mention this.

1125
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:08,880
If you're a fan of the game In the Groove, you can now, with this latest update they've

1126
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,280
done on the machine, you can do your own custom MP3s and steps.

1127
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,760
So basically, In the Groove has basically come out and legitimized itself as Step Mania

1128
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,760
in the arcade.

1129
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,520
There's only one problem though.

1130
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,520
What are they going to do for audio licensing since I'm sure they didn't address that since

1131
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:33,800
the game is not licensed on the machine and usually the machine will cover the licensing

1132
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:38,280
for the songs that are in the game, but now that place, say if the RIA comes in and hears

1133
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,000
someone playing Christina Aguilera or something like that on the machine, they could sue them.

1134
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,960
Sorry, Chatham is correcting me and saying it's actually OGG files.

1135
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
We are starting to get some calls.

1136
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,960
We'll come back to this in a minute.

1137
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1138
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,960
Who's this?

1139
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,960
Hi.

1140
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,960
This is Sephiroth1215 here.

1141
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.

1142
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,600
What's on your mind?

1143
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,560
I'm pretty much fresh off of Digital Life.

1144
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,080
How is Digital Life?

1145
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,320
Tell us a little bit about this.

1146
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,640
The first time you get in there, it looks kind of cool.

1147
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,140
It's nice and big.

1148
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,800
So much to see, but it's really not that great this year.

1149
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,800
Really?

1150
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,900
Why is that?

1151
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,880
You had some good things.

1152
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,880
Maybe a few gaming booths, depending on what you like, though.

1153
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,880
Now Digital Life is not exclusively a gaming show, right?

1154
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,480
There's lots of stuff there.

1155
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,480
No, there's plenty of stuff there.

1156
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:41,480
Probably a lot of the space, though, was from MLG and another gaming league of some sort.

1157
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,880
Was Sony the best booth there?

1158
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,840
Sony's booth was kind of small, not to mention it was right next to Microsoft's booth.

1159
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,840
Really?

1160
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,560
Did you get your hands on the plate?

1161
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:57,100
I got to play the PS3.

1162
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,040
It played very well from what I got to see.

1163
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,720
It played a little bit of Resistance.

1164
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,520
Okay, that's something that didn't have an E3, I don't think, right?

1165
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,760
What did you think of it?

1166
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,760
It was good.

1167
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,840
I was more so looking at the graphics and the movements of the characters more so than

1168
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
the gameplay, though.

1169
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,020
What do you think?

1170
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,120
Did this sell you on the game, or on the system, I should say?

1171
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:30,280
It proved to me that the system can be more solid than I originally thought, because I

1172
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:35,760
thought maybe everything was going to be kind of blocky, or it wasn't...

1173
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,040
I don't know how to explain it, really.

1174
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:45,680
But I guess just to compare, I got to play the Wii a bit, and I played Elibits, and oddly

1175
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,400
enough there were problems playing that.

1176
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,360
Oh, what kind of problems?

1177
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:56,240
The controls were off, I mean, you had to stay to the left, and it had the same kind

1178
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,800
of problem that Sonic did, where you go a little bit and the cursor goes far off into

1179
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,800
the screen.

1180
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,440
Was it just maybe miscalibrated?

1181
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,640
It might have been, I'm not quite sure.

1182
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:15,960
It was only a demo of the game, so it could change later, not to mention the loading time

1183
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,760
was way over a minute, just to even start the demo.

1184
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:26,200
Hmm, wow, so that's interesting, kind of a different reaction than we heard from E3,

1185
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,920
where everybody was buzzing about the Wii and not so buzzing about the PS3.

1186
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,720
What do you think was the best thing you saw at Digital Life?

1187
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,800
Honestly, the best thing at Digital Life was the DDR booth, which is where I was working

1188
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,120
all weekend.

1189
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,440
What was there, what was at the DDR booth that made it so great?

1190
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,960
There's tournaments going on all weekend long.

1191
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,920
Not to mention, we were the only booth that had the best giveaways.

1192
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,720
What kind of stuff was being, oh, that's right, because they do like the $1,000 tournament

1193
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,720
there or something, right?

1194
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,240
Like big, big money.

1195
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:04,440
Overall, it was about over $8,000 worth of prize money and prizes.

1196
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,640
I'm kind of pissed I missed New York City by a week, I would have loved to have been

1197
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
there.

1198
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,560
Honestly, it's alright, because from what I hear they're having talks about, it's not

1199
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:20,320
completely official yet, so you can't take my word on it, is next year, because there's

1200
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,920
no more big E3, there's also going to be a Digital Life in LA.

1201
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,920
Oh, interesting.

1202
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,840
We might have to check that out.

1203
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,680
Are you going to be at Nintendo World Store Saturday at noon, because I'm going to be

1204
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,680
there?

1205
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,680
Yeah.

1206
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,680
Alright.

1207
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,520
Not to put you on the spot or anything, but if you're not there, I'm going to cry.

1208
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,520
No, I'm kidding.

1209
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,520
I might have to see you.

1210
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,000
No, I didn't know you were going to be there Saturday.

1211
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,680
Oh, did you not hear the part A?

1212
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,680
Yeah, I'm going to be there Saturday at noon.

1213
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,680
Okay.

1214
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,680
I'll be there.

1215
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,680
Alright.

1216
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,680
Well, we'll see you then.

1217
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,680
Anything else you want to say for listeners?

1218
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,680
No, not really.

1219
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,680
Alright.

1220
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,680
We'll go to some more calls.

1221
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,520
Glad to hear you had a good time at Digital Life.

1222
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,520
Take care.

1223
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,520
You too.

1224
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,520
Laid up.

1225
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,520
Alright, bye.

1226
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,520
Bye.

1227
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,120
Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.

1228
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:11,880
It's Orange Lounge Radio, username on Skype, or you can always give us a call on the old

1229
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,880
regular telephone.

1230
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,880
It's 916-226-9627.

1231
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,880
Yes.

1232
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,160
Let's go to another call.

1233
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,440
Yes, you're on the air.

1234
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,840
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1235
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,840
Who's this?

1236
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,160
Legend of Zaku.

1237
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,160
Hold on, Legend of Zaku.

1238
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,480
You need to sit tight for a minute.

1239
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,720
Just a hint, guys.

1240
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,600
I'm going to let you in on a little radio secret here, okay?

1241
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,480
Sometimes we pick up the calls a little bit before I'm ready to acknowledge that you're

1242
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,560
actually on the line just because it makes for a smoother transition that way.

1243
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,880
So until we say, Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1244
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,880
Shh.

1245
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,880
Be quiet.

1246
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,880
Be quiet.

1247
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,880
Alright.

1248
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Zaku, what's on your mind?

1249
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,160
Yo, I was also there too, man.

1250
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,280
I was also at Digital Life.

1251
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,320
I had a feeling you'd have something to say on Digital Life.

1252
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,320
As a matter of fact, I competed.

1253
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,480
I competed in freestyle on Saturday.

1254
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,480
And how was it?

1255
01:05:53,480 --> 01:06:00,280
And what I'm about to post right now in the chat room is a link to the actual, to my routine.

1256
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,600
Granted, it was a bad routine.

1257
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
Get it?

1258
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,800
Yes, you got the get it joke right there.

1259
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,800
Hold on.

1260
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,800
I did give the audience a good opportunity.

1261
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,800
Hold on.

1262
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
I'm actually looking at it right now.

1263
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,800
Let me turn this down.

1264
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,360
Yeah, it was a bad routine.

1265
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,080
You're looking at the screen.

1266
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,480
How long did you practice this?

1267
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,580
I was totally unprepared for this.

1268
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:25,400
This was an improv all the way.

1269
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:30,880
I was like, yeah, you got some cool alarm movements there, but yeah, Zaku, you're looking

1270
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,120
at the screen too much, buddy.

1271
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,120
I'm sorry.

1272
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,120
I know.

1273
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,120
But it's alright though.

1274
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:39,760
I wouldn't care less right now because I had a good time and I have no regrets for that.

1275
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,040
Did you see somebody left you a comment to go dance on some landmines?

1276
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,240
The internet's mean.

1277
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,240
Alright.

1278
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,880
I also played the Wii.

1279
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,160
Yeah, what did you think of the Wii?

1280
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,160
On Elibits, definitely.

1281
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,720
That was hot.

1282
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,720
You liked Elibits?

1283
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,040
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1284
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:03,680
I mean, it was fun for the fact that you could actually aim and move stuff around.

1285
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,360
It wasn't miscalibrated for you?

1286
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:15,320
Yeah, I mean, it was a little jerky, but I had to move a little bit back because when

1287
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,960
I moved up closer, it wasn't even engaging.

1288
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,880
The more further away I was from the screen, the more better the controls were.

1289
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,880
What about PS3?

1290
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,320
Did you get your little hands on the PS3?

1291
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,480
The lines were pretty long for that.

1292
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,400
I managed to play Guitar Hero 2 as well.

1293
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,040
What did you think of that?

1294
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,960
It's kind of like the same thing.

1295
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,840
It just has more difficulties.

1296
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,160
You can select characters and guitars.

1297
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,520
Here's another last minute story involving Guitar Hero 2 now that you brought it up.

1298
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,520
Yeah, about the controller.

1299
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,520
Hey!

1300
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
Hey!

1301
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,520
Who's hosting this show?

1302
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,520
I'm sorry, man.

1303
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,360
I'm sorry about spilling the beans, as you were.

1304
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,840
You might as well finish your thought.

1305
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:00,680
Zaku, why don't you play OLR Reporter here and tell us this story about Guitar Hero 2?

1306
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:10,760
From what's being said, a demo version is not allowing you to play third-party controllers.

1307
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:16,920
In other words, this company that essentially made its name on making third-party controllers

1308
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:23,080
has locked third-party controllers out of its next game, according to the demo, if the

1309
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,020
demo is any indication.

1310
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,520
Right now, I've got to go, but I'll let you know.

1311
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,880
I have some freeze swag.

1312
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,880
What happened?

1313
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,880
What's going on?

1314
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,880
Why do you have to go so fast?

1315
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,280
Now, I've got some stuff to take care of.

1316
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,280
All right.

1317
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,120
I'll let you know if any freeze swag has something to do with it.

1318
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
All right, Zaku.

1319
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:48,080
Go tell the cops who said aye.

1320
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080
Worst call ever.

1321
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:55,720
This is the part in Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood that we learn about the word of the day.

1322
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,160
The word of the day is fire escape.

1323
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,720
You know what a fire escape is?

1324
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,760
Cabbage Patch Kid.

1325
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,960
Hi, Aaron Orange Laudreo.

1326
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,960
Who's this?

1327
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,960
Hi.

1328
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,960
It's Rama.

1329
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,960
Hi, Rama.

1330
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
What's on your mind?

1331
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,960
Hi, Rama.

1332
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,840
Hi, Uchan.

1333
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,840
Go figure.

1334
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,160
All the New York City listeners are trying to hammer like mad to get through tonight.

1335
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,160
Let me guess.

1336
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,160
Did you go to Digital Life?

1337
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,160
Yes, I did.

1338
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,720
You did say last week you want all the New York callers to call in, so we did.

1339
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,720
All right.

1340
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,720
Well, what's on your mind?

1341
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,720
How was Digital Life?

1342
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,720
It was fun.

1343
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,240
Yesterday I didn't get as much swag, but today I got there early, got plenty of good stuff,

1344
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,240
mostly t-shirts.

1345
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,840
Did you get to play PlayStation 3?

1346
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,120
I didn't even bother.

1347
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,120
Why not?

1348
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,920
They had NBA Live up there, and it was like everybody else was around there like drooling

1349
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,920
over NBA Live.

1350
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,640
I'm like, it's just a game.

1351
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:54,320
I played at the $600 brick last week and walked away, played the Wii.

1352
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,720
You're cutting out a little bit there.

1353
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:59,240
You said you didn't play the $600 brick, but you played the Wii?

1354
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,240
Yes.

1355
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,240
How was the Wii?

1356
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,520
It was a little bit new to me.

1357
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
I played Elibit.

1358
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,520
It was fun.

1359
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,640
Was Elibit the only game they had there or something?

1360
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,040
No, they also had Madden for the Wii, but EA shut down now for some odd reason.

1361
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,040
Oh, okay.

1362
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,040
What did you think of Elibit?

1363
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,280
It was fun.

1364
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,200
I didn't even want to get off the machine.

1365
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
Okay.

1366
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,200
What happened with DDR?

1367
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,480
Did you do any of the DDR stuff?

1368
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,320
I walked over there, but it was so crowded, so I just watched.

1369
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,600
I just hung out with Zaku and Sephiroth for a bit.

1370
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,600
All right.

1371
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,600
I mostly...

1372
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,320
And you're all going to come see me in New York next week, right?

1373
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,320
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

1374
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,320
I'm telling you.

1375
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
Get in touch with me Friday night for dinner.

1376
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,320
All right.

1377
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,320
Sounds good.

1378
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,000
Well, I'll email you with the real itinerary a little later.

1379
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Of course.

1380
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,240
That's the only thing I'm publicly saying I'm doing is the Saturday noon thing, but

1381
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,440
I'll tell you a little more about what I'm doing later.

1382
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
That's cool.

1383
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,440
All right.

1384
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,440
Anything else you want to share about Digital Life?

1385
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,440
Man, it was fun.

1386
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:04,000
I mean, I remember talking before about how it's going to be the next E3, but it's more

1387
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,160
of a tech explore than anything else, so...

1388
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:11,080
So you're saying because of the fact it's a little bit too broad in its tech specs that

1389
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,040
it may not have the power to be the next E3?

1390
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,160
I don't see it happening any time soon.

1391
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,160
I don't.

1392
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,160
All right.

1393
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,160
Well, we'll see.

1394
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,160
We'll see.

1395
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,160
Especially if there's a Digital Life LA.

1396
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,160
We'll see.

1397
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,160
All right, Rama, thanks for the call.

1398
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,160
No, Saturday.

1399
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,160
You got it.

1400
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,160
Friday.

1401
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,160
Maybe Friday if you're lucky.

1402
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,160
All right.

1403
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
All right.

1404
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,160
Later.

1405
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Hey.

1406
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,160
That was Rama here, another New York City listener.

1407
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1408
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,760
Who's this?

1409
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,760
Raven's Dolphin.

1410
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,760
Hello, buddy.

1411
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,480
What's on your mind?

1412
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,160
You made me force me to get a Wii order.

1413
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,160
Hold on.

1414
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,160
Hold on.

1415
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,160
Sit tight for a minute there.

1416
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,160
Hold on.

1417
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,200
Extrovert snuck in here while we've been taking these calls.

1418
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,280
Did you notice, Extrovert, that all the same people that call into the Wednesday show call

1419
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,280
into this show?

1420
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,640
Isn't that funny?

1421
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,040
That is mucho hilarious.

1422
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,480
Yeah, it's great.

1423
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,480
It's the same people.

1424
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,480
Listen to both shows.

1425
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,480
It's amazing.

1426
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
I'm sorry, Raven's Dolphin.

1427
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,480
What were you saying?

1428
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,520
You were saying something about the Wii pre-ordering?

1429
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,600
You forced me to get a Wii order for the day of Orange Launch Radio.

1430
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,600
What did I do?

1431
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,600
Get a gun to your head?

1432
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,600
No.

1433
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,600
You've been talking about, you've got to get a Wii.

1434
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,600
You've got to get a Wii.

1435
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,600
You've got to get a Wii.

1436
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
What did I say?

1437
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,600
You've got to get a Wii.

1438
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,600
You've got to get a Wii.

1439
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,760
But that's what's going through my mind.

1440
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,760
You're like, Wii.

1441
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,760
Like, 200?

1442
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:24,240
No, because I want a Wii really badly.

1443
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,480
As I said earlier, I referenced what I told that email bag thing earlier.

1444
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,880
You really have to make decisions based on what's best for you.

1445
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,960
And what's best for me right now, Wii.

1446
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,360
I figured your logic too.

1447
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:40,360
I'm going Wii 60 all the way.

1448
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,360
How was your experience pre-ordering?

1449
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,520
Where did you go?

1450
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
How was it?

1451
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,000
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

1452
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,600
The mall I didn't go to was jammed.

1453
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,440
I mean, God, I'm glad I didn't go there.

1454
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,760
But the one in Atlantic City was nice.

1455
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,560
I stood in line for an hour and 40 minutes.

1456
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,240
It was like this woman, her car broke down.

1457
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,320
I'm sorry to hear that.

1458
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,200
But her kid wanted the Wii so bad.

1459
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,400
It was eight people.

1460
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,400
And they were all nice.

1461
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,920
Wait, it was eight people that all came together?

1462
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,880
Or it was eight people on the line?

1463
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,880
Eight people in line.

1464
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,880
Oh, that doesn't seem...

1465
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,560
Whereabouts are you from?

1466
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,900
Atlantic City.

1467
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,440
That doesn't seem very long, all things considered, for a town like Atlantic City.

1468
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,920
Only eight people on the line.

1469
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,920
Huh.

1470
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,920
Well, okay.

1471
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,640
We're a small town.

1472
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,960
The only thing we do is gamble.

1473
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,960
I guess that's true.

1474
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,960
That's true.

1475
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,280
Yeah, but I bet the Vegas GameStop lines were long.

1476
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,280
I bet.

1477
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:40,280
Well, you know, one of the best places to go for cheap electronics is pawn shops in

1478
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,300
gambling towns.

1479
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,040
So go to your local pawn shop.

1480
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,040
Find a Wii.

1481
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,040
That's a good suggestion.

1482
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,320
Well, what did you pre-order with your Wii?

1483
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,960
Did you just get the Wii or did you get any games?

1484
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:57,560
I just got the Wii because I know I have to have it Orange Lounge radio episode I can't

1485
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,160
remember for the 19th.

1486
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,160
All right.

1487
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,200
Yeah, I don't know what number it is either, but it's going to be an interesting show.

1488
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,680
Our buddy DMN is actually going to be here in-house.

1489
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,680
So we're going to have our Nintendo QA guy actually here in-house.

1490
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,000
So it'll be fun.

1491
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,080
Yeah, one more.

1492
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:17,480
I actually went to a McDonald's for a Wayport and it works pretty good.

1493
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,480
All right.

1494
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,480
That's cool.

1495
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,920
And you got a vision camera.

1496
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,320
Now we can have a Rob Astley.

1497
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,520
No.

1498
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,240
Not happening.

1499
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,880
Not without proper compensation.

1500
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,880
Bye.

1501
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,880
All right, freak.

1502
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,880
I'm hanging up on you now.

1503
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,880
Bye.

1504
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:32,880
Bye.

1505
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,880
What is up with that?

1506
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,880
What's with the...

1507
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,640
It's so weird.

1508
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
Who would want to see that?

1509
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,280
Who would want to see my ass on Xbox Live?

1510
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,280
That's disgusting.

1511
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,280
Oh, Rob.

1512
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,400
You know everyone wants to see your ass.

1513
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,840
Not until I work it out a little bit.

1514
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,840
Sorry.

1515
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,840
I think they want to see your Wii.

1516
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,620
Well, they ain't going to get that.

1517
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,620
One more call.

1518
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,840
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge radio.

1519
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Who's this?

1520
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,840
It's Darkteeth.

1521
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,600
Hey, what's on your mind, Darkteeth?

1522
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Darkteeth?

1523
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,600
No, Darktetsuya.

1524
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,600
It's...

1525
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,600
Darkteeth.

1526
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,600
It's short for Darktetsuya.

1527
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,600
I'm sorry.

1528
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,600
Shut up and let the man talk.

1529
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
We have iced tea.

1530
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
We have darkteeth.

1531
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,600
He's one of our hardworking staffers.

1532
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,600
What's on your mind?

1533
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,240
I had a few FUs.

1534
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
You have FUs?

1535
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,240
Well...

1536
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Are they gaming-related?

1537
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,240
Yeah.

1538
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,880
Okay, then we'll take them.

1539
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,880
What's up?

1540
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:27,920
Well, you heard about Konami's little Link issue thing on Supernova?

1541
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,960
Yeah, I guess they officially declared that Link Mode ain't happening this week, or, I

1542
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,520
mean, this week the official press announcement went out, or whatever you want to call it.

1543
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,720
At least DDR Freak ran it, that said Link Mode's not happening in Supernova.

1544
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,720
That makes you mad?

1545
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,720
Yeah.

1546
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,720
Oh, a little bit.

1547
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:47,360
Were you looking forward to making custom dance steps to songs such as, you know, what...

1548
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,040
I don't even know what the hell songs are in Supernova.

1549
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,960
Well, I had it planned.

1550
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,960
I see.

1551
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,960
Okay.

1552
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,960
Any other FUs?

1553
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,960
Gaming-related?

1554
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:04,840
Well, just that my local arcade hasn't gotten Supernova yet.

1555
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,480
What is up with lack of Supernova machines in Sacramento?

1556
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,480
I know.

1557
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,400
I guess we're just not a real town.

1558
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,640
We're just some cow town in the middle of nowhere.

1559
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,560
Well, someday, Dark Tetsuya, someday.

1560
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,560
Yeah.

1561
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,640
Hey, did you do any of the Wii pre-ordering or PlayStation 3?

1562
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,640
Oh, no.

1563
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,640
I'm not kidding.

1564
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,640
Are you going to be getting any of them?

1565
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,440
I'll probably get a Wii for Christmas.

1566
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,440
Okay.

1567
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,960
Oh, you're hoping Santa will bring you one?

1568
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,280
Yeah.

1569
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,480
Have you been good this year?

1570
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,480
Oh, yeah.

1571
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,760
Well, then maybe Santa will bring you one, so that'll be cool.

1572
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,760
All right.

1573
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,440
Or he'll give you a spanking or some coal.

1574
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,440
Yeah.

1575
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,840
If you've been bad, though, you'll get a six axis, and that's all you get.

1576
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,080
You just get the paperweight of a six axis.

1577
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,680
You guys aren't on the Afterbirth, right?

1578
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,680
No.

1579
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,680
We're on the actual podcast show.

1580
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,680
Oh, wow.

1581
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,680
I've never been on the podcast before.

1582
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,680
I guess this is my first time.

1583
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,680
Oh, sorry.

1584
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,140
Extrofer's one of our other personalities on Orange Lawns Radio.

1585
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:59,560
He does the Wednesday night show with me, and what else would they know you from?

1586
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,720
He had a train wreck show that was on the station a while ago.

1587
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,720
Yeah.

1588
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,720
It was called Train Wreck the Show.

1589
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,000
You play a lot of World of Warcraft.

1590
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,720
You've been on this show before, haven't you?

1591
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,080
I've been on Orange Lawns Radio, but I haven't been on the podcast.

1592
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
That is the podcast.

1593
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,080
Orange Lawns Radio is the podcast.

1594
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,080
No, no.

1595
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,080
I was on it before you guys.

1596
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,080
Oh, okay.

1597
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
You did the live show and then the podcast.

1598
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,080
Fine.

1599
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,080
Well, now you're here.

1600
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,080
I don't fucking care.

1601
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
Welcome to the goddamn show.

1602
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
Thank you.

1603
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
Now be quiet.

1604
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,080
All right.

1605
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,080
Anything else on your mind, Dark Dead Sea?

1606
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,080
Blood in your vagina.

1607
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,680
Well, other than that, I really like Supernova.

1608
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,680
Yeah?

1609
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,960
Do you like the home release of Supernova?

1610
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,960
Yep.

1611
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,960
Top three songs.

1612
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:34,960
Quick.

1613
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,960
Oh, God.

1614
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:42,440
That'll settle with that honor, humanity, and Gummel and the couple.

1615
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,440
Of course.

1616
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,920
Of course you'd say that.

1617
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,480
Guacamole del Taco, right?

1618
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,480
Oh, yeah.

1619
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,480
All right.

1620
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,480
All right, Dark Tetsuya.

1621
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,480
Thanks so much for the call.

1622
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,480
Have a good one.

1623
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,480
All right?

1624
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,480
You too.

1625
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,480
Later.

1626
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,780
One of our hardworking staff members there, that Dark Tetsuya.

1627
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,280
We appreciate him.

1628
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,160
All right, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight, if you didn't get through.

1629
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,320
So sorry.

1630
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,320
Try again next week.

1631
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,320
Any other last minute stories?

1632
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,760
Loki.

1633
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,760
Of course.

1634
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,320
We talked about it earlier about video game movies and there being a movie called 8-Bit

1635
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,560
the Movie.

1636
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,920
Well, actually, there is another movie coming out.

1637
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,680
For your PSP, you can download the entire movie.

1638
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:27,100
It's called Killing Time 24x7, and it is available online, actually, for full download

1639
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,000
to your PSP, which I think is kind of cool.

1640
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,120
It's kind of like a Hitman movie, basically.

1641
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,400
The main character who kills people and in his spare time hangs out with his friends

1642
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:44,040
and goes to arcades and whatnot and stuff, gets a new assignment, and his new hit is

1643
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,360
his father, and so it's kind of based on that.

1644
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,360
It's actually pretty cool.

1645
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:56,360
The download itself is about 300, just over 300 megs, and you can actually find it to

1646
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:02,200
download and I'm pulling up the website actually right now.

1647
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
Thrilling radio.

1648
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,200
Sorry.

1649
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:18,800
Yeah, but anyways, I believe it's killingtime-24-7.com if you want to download it, download it for

1650
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,800
your PSP.

1651
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,800
All right.

1652
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,800
That's it?

1653
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,800
That's all I have.

1654
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,800
Wow.

1655
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,800
For now.

1656
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,800
That's all I have.

1657
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,800
Usually you have a whole shitload of last minute news.

1658
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,960
Well, you know, I mean, we can talk about some other stuff, I guess, since we were talking

1659
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,960
about...

1660
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:33,960
How about one sentence?

1661
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,960
One sentence news.

1662
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,960
One sentence news.

1663
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,960
Okay.

1664
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:37,960
Yes.

1665
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,960
Coming soon.

1666
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:39,960
Sky's voice the game.

1667
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:40,960
No.

1668
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,320
The, was it the, one of the professional gaming leagues in Pizza Hut teamed up and no one

1669
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,320
cared.

1670
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,320
That was good.

1671
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,040
That was one sentence.

1672
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,800
Tony Hawk's Project 8 gets some pretty awesome multiplayer on the 360.

1673
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,360
PlayStation 3 does not have any multiplayer whatsoever.

1674
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,240
I think that was two sentences, but that's all right.

1675
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,240
It was good.

1676
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,240
Send me a colon.

1677
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,240
Was there?

1678
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,240
Okay.

1679
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,640
Um, Microsoft launched a new website to browse Xbox Live Marketplace.

1680
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,720
Ah, I actually saw that.

1681
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,720
And that was pretty cool.

1682
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,920
Ah, that, see, you made it two sentences.

1683
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,560
I was, I was done with the story.

1684
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,560
Oh, sorry.

1685
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,560
Anyways.

1686
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,080
And the website is Xbox Pipeline or whatever that's called.

1687
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,760
Xbox Live Pipeline, something like that.

1688
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,760
Something like that.

1689
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,760
Anyways.

1690
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,760
We're so informative.

1691
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:23,760
Yeah, there's some website.

1692
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,360
I couldn't tell you what the name of it is.

1693
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,360
Whoa, okay.

1694
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,360
Here.

1695
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,360
Okay.

1696
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,480
I will tell you the exact website because I am awesome like that.

1697
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:36,720
Anyways, the actual website is XboxLivePipeline.com, so go check it out if you haven't already.

1698
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,280
It has the look and feel of an Xbox.

1699
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,280
It's kind of nice.

1700
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,280
It's pretty cool.

1701
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,760
I have some news.

1702
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,480
Okay.

1703
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,400
Loki is officially very funny.

1704
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,320
Last night we went and ate out at a, um, buffet place.

1705
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,320
Okay.

1706
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,440
I'm sorry, this doesn't have to do with the games.

1707
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,800
We killed people on the way because we were racing there.

1708
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,400
Is that good enough?

1709
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:06,560
Anyways, Loki asks the waiter, the waitress or whoever she was serving us or whatever.

1710
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:13,840
She said he, he asked her if we, they're serving any popcorn shrimp and she goes, and he looks

1711
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,840
at her.

1712
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,840
He goes, okay.

1713
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,920
And everybody's like, did you understand what she just said?

1714
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,360
Loki's, Loki's just very calm.

1715
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,360
I didn't understand anything.

1716
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,080
Anyways, it's just so funny.

1717
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,320
Give it up for extra furnace, farewell performance here on Orange Labs Radio.

1718
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,320
All right.

1719
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:36,400
Um, one thing I did want to mention, I read this week on the PlayStation 3 online web

1720
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:41,160
browser they were talking about, um, that it has is for text entry.

1721
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,400
If you don't have, you know, a controller or whatever, it has that crappy text entry

1722
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,040
that they have on the PSP.

1723
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,040
Isn't that stupid?

1724
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,320
I just wanted to mention that.

1725
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:57,840
Um, some other fun stuff I was going to say, um, I remember, well, Japan's getting a brand

1726
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,360
new Wii classic controller plus five or 5,000 point bundle, which is nice because we'll

1727
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,080
never see that here.

1728
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,320
And I think that was all I had.

1729
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:14,080
Oh, oh, PlayStation 3 Oblivion's getting, was supposed to be getting exclusive content

1730
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,280
for it, but it actually is going to be available for us as well.

1731
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,560
So on the Xbox 360 and PC.

1732
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,120
Oh well.

1733
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:25,840
Oh, a new Prey content for online multiplayer maps and stuff.

1734
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,400
I really haven't played much Prey.

1735
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,400
We should.

1736
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,200
It's some easy ass achievement points and achievement points more like you ought to

1737
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,200
be efficient.

1738
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,200
I know.

1739
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,200
I'm meaning to get some.

1740
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,440
If you and I would play some death match, we could get those 25 kill achievements like

1741
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,440
that.

1742
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,440
It'd be easy.

1743
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,240
Just, yeah, too bad they don't have split screen multiplayer because that's how I did

1744
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,280
it with, uh, Ghost Recon.

1745
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,280
Cheater.

1746
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,280
Cheater.

1747
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,280
All right.

1748
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,520
Um, I don't have any more last minute news.

1749
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,520
Dark Sakura?

1750
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:57,320
Um, actually I did want to make a mention, uh, for our European listeners, um, that people

1751
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:04,960
who are fans of Eurogamer, they've, uh, brought out a new download service, uh, for a $12.95

1752
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:11,320
a month for the Ultimate Collection so you can get, uh, uh, different games.

1753
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:16,400
Um, they actually have, uh, for $6.95, access to the Essential Collection with 90 games

1754
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,680
to choose from including Prince of Persia, Hitman, Contract, Splinter Cell, Pandora,

1755
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,680
Tomorrow.

1756
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:27,160
Um, lots of different stuff coming up on there, um, but I would recommend going onto their

1757
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,040
main page and taking a look at it.

1758
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:35,800
If you want to play, uh, Java or NES games on your PC at work instead of working, you

1759
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:44,520
can go to vnes.thatsanderskid.com and they have a whole Java thing for playing Nintendo

1760
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,520
games.

1761
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,520
All right, this is too much news for one night.

1762
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,520
It's time to wrap up the program.

1763
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,520
I'm done.

1764
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,320
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1765
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,840
Extrofer, your final thought, dare I ask?

1766
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,520
Loki, will you marry me?

1767
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,160
Loki, your final thought.

1768
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,160
No.

1769
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,160
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

1770
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:09,800
Oh, yes, I forgot the Grudge 2 opened up this weekend.

1771
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,400
Who wants to go see it with me?

1772
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,720
Not me, that's my final thought.

1773
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:19,560
Extrofer will go see it with me, won't you?

1774
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,560
No.

1775
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,560
I'm kidding.

1776
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,560
I'm kidding.

1777
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,560
I'm kidding.

1778
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,560
Oh, damn, I wish it were a TV.

1779
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,560
No, I totally won't.

1780
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,560
You should see the way he did that.

1781
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,560
He kind of did this whole little...

1782
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,560
I will.

1783
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,560
Well, no.

1784
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,560
No, I...

1785
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,800
It's not you, Dark Sakura.

1786
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,800
It's the movie.

1787
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,800
I...

1788
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,800
You know what?

1789
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,800
No, I will see it.

1790
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,800
I just want to see Sarah Michelle Gellar die.

1791
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,800
I do, too.

1792
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,800
Oh, my God.

1793
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,800
Spoilers.

1794
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,800
No, she doesn't die soon.

1795
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:46,760
I saw a really good movie this last weekend, though, called The Departed.

1796
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:47,760
It was so great.

1797
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,760
Great, great, great.

1798
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,760
Guess what?

1799
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,760
Guess what?

1800
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,760
What?

1801
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,760
Rob.

1802
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,760
What?

1803
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,760
Rob.

1804
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,760
What?

1805
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,760
What?

1806
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,760
What?

1807
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,760
What?

1808
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,760
What?

1809
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,760
What?

1810
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,760
What?

1811
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,760
What's going on right there?

1812
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:06,280
Two quick, quick quick things that came out.

1813
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:12,000
One thing that's being reported in our chat literally right this second, Bubble Bubble

1814
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,020
for the DS is broken.

1815
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,360
Players cannot be past level 30.

1816
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,500
This has been confirmed by Codemasters.

1817
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,960
Way to go, Codemasters QA.

1818
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,080
Loki, your thing, real quick?

1819
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,820
Oh, I was just making fun of this thing.

1820
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:29,420
They ran a report on Gizmodo about stuff that you can buy that looks stupid.

1821
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:34,700
that you can buy that looks stupid. There's a Mame cabinet costume for Halloween. I just

1822
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:39,640
thought it was funny because the joystick, which is abnormally large, is placed right

1823
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:44,720
next to where his penis would be, and the coin door, which has two slots right where

1824
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:49,460
his balls would be. That's just the college humor in me.

1825
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:54,440
That's lovely. And on that note, we're going to call it a night for Orange Lounge Radio

1826
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,380
this week. Remember, we will not be live on Sunday next week. We're pre-taped because

1827
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:02,420
both DarkSakura and I are traveling. Shh. God dammit.

1828
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,700
Remember, YowieCon. Or New York City, Nintendo World Store.

1829
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:10,700
Or Nightmare Before Christmas at the Metreon on Friday night.

1830
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,900
And that- Exeter! Hey, I do a lot better than you do.

1831
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,900
I know. Can I just unplug that microphone? Yeah, there we go. See, now it's unplugged.

1832
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:24,580
Thank you for supporting independent internet radio even when it's crappy like tonight.

1833
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,580
Good night.

1834
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:30,580
