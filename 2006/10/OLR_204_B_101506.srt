[SPEAKER_10]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:25,260
[SPEAKER_12]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 204 for this, October the 15th of 2006.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:35,524
[SPEAKER_12]: And if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget that Orange Lounge Radio is podcast twice a week, so you're actually listening to the second half of a show already in progress.

5
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:40,926
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to catch the whole thing live when it broadcasts, you should listen to Orange Lounge Radio live on Sunday nights.

6
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:48,832
[SPEAKER_12]: or there's always our rebroadcast that plays on All Games Radio, Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

7
00:00:49,372 --> 00:01:03,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of All Games Radio, our buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show over there Sunday nights as well, just before we do, he's going to be doing some type of trivia contest at the big video games expo, which I wish I was going, but sadly I'm not.

8
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:11,109
[SPEAKER_12]: The VG Expo, if you're within traveling distance, unfortunately, when I talk about going, now we're talking about a plane ticket.

9
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:14,357
[SPEAKER_12]: But for those of you on the East Coast, it's probably very drivable from lots of different spots.

10
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:14,918
[SPEAKER_12]: VGExpo.com

11
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:51,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, such is life that we would have more news about Halo 3 at some point and at some point it's going to be Halloween.

12
00:01:52,019 --> 00:02:02,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the spooky holiday will feature some brand new news about Halo 3 and yeah, that's about all we know is that there's going to be news.

13
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:05,464
[SPEAKER_11]: It's news about upcoming news.

14
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:09,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Halo 3 is coming soon.

15
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:11,967
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be the big news.

16
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:23,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think as we theorized previously, because you had that whole report talking about Halo 3 is likely to be coming out in April or May, do you think this could be where they drop that bombshell?

17
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:25,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Could this be the big bombshell that's coming out?

18
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:29,227
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be aptly timed, but probably not.

19
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:31,769
[SPEAKER_12]: You think it's more something along the notion of gameplay?

20
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,194
[SPEAKER_12]: You know this is time, though, to take a little bit of Sony's thunder from PlayStation 3.

21
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:44,714
[SPEAKER_12]: to get people talking about Halo 3 amongst the PlayStation 3 and Wii chaos that's sure to be going on in November.

22
00:02:44,874 --> 00:03:03,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess currently right now they're showing Halo 3 to a select group of magazine journalists, not websites, but a handful of magazine folks, and yeah, it looks like they're going to be having some sort of event, and they're inviting game journalists from the U.S.

23
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:08,020
[SPEAKER_11]: and Europe to visit their studio and show a quick single-player

24
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Demo.

25
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:21,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, you know, I would say go out and buy the magazine to see the news, but it's going to be all over the internet the day it comes out anyway, probably before it lands in your mailbox, so just read the internet.

26
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:32,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of things that are at least being said around the internet and other places, Sony's talking some crap.

27
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, to be specific, that would be Nobuyuki Ide, who is the

28
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,512
[SPEAKER_06]: former, um, uh, wasn't he the former CEO of Sony?

29
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:47,837
[SPEAKER_06]: He's actually their current chief corporate advisor.

30
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:55,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So when he was asked about the Xbox 360 being the PS3 to market, he said Microsoft is not a technology company.

31
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,305
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they make lunchboxes.

32
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and Nintendo makes cards.

33
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:11,328
[SPEAKER_12]: at least they used to back in the day but you know yeah they made Hanafuda cards doesn't he used to run brothels too?

34
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know but this I just think that's funny because this guy was responsible for a lot of damage to Sony's profits back in the day but you know I think that it would be in Sony's best interest right now not to be throwing mud you know that's what I would be doing you know

35
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:40,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Concentrate on getting your console out instead of saying, our console's better than your console.

36
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, except our console's not out yet and yours is.

37
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:47,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Sony pisses me off even more because they're discontinuing the AIBO.

38
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the AIBO.

39
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but the AIBO is useless.

40
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,312
[SPEAKER_06]: The AIBO is their little robot dog.

41
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

42
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:58,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that if they're going to do anything, they should make the AIBO a peripheral for the PS3.

43
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,515
[SPEAKER_12]: That would sell more units.

44
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,055
[SPEAKER_12]: That might actually happen.

45
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,136
[SPEAKER_12]: That might sell me one.

46
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:04,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd buy one.

47
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,786
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just what I need, my PlayStation 3 to bark at me and play Blu-rays.

48
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Brilliant idea, Jamie.

49
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:15,691
[SPEAKER_11]: After all, I mean, after looking at what was the Eye of Judgment set up that they have at G... I don't think that's true.

50
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it would lower your blood pressure.

51
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:20,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd rather have a barking PlayStation 3 in that Eye of Judgment.

52
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:21,394
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

53
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:22,174
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't bark.

54
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:29,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It would hook up to the PS3 and you would play, like, instead of having Nintendogs, you'd have a real dog sim because you'd have your robot dog.

55
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:30,739
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like Rob the Robot.

56
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But only, like...

57
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:35,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Only good for more than one game.

58
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:39,236
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I always wish they would... This is why you're on internet radio, Jamie, and not in a boardroom.

59
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,237
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

60
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:42,517
[SPEAKER_06]: My ideas would sell money.

61
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:43,377
[SPEAKER_06]: People should hire me.

62
00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:55,000
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to create Rob the Robot, like, as in... I always wanted, like, a miniature version of it for, like, the DS or something like that, that would sit next to your DS and do the same little thing and just re-release Gyromite or something like that.

63
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:55,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that'd be fun.

64
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, one of the good things, though, about the AIBO is it actually was a very inexpensive...

65
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:09,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty, you know, interestingly complex AI, you know, in the little system that you could afford better than, like, a human-sized robot.

66
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:15,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of AI developers and robotics experts were actually buying AIBOs for experiments.

67
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:19,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Drunami in our chatroom is suggesting that here on Orange Sounds Radio we could replace Loki with an AIBO.

68
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:21,544
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be cute.

69
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:22,345
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be pretty fun.

70
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet the AIBO is a lot cuter.

71
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:25,925
[SPEAKER_06]: AIBOs are really cute.

72
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:27,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd go well with my new Mac.

73
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:29,206
[SPEAKER_06]: When I get it.

74
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:53,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of Sony, before Loki has a chance to give a counter-argument there, speaking about Sony executives who are sitting in boardrooms eating crayons all day when they ought to be working, this executive, Michael Ephraim from Sony of Australia, you know, he made this crazy comment earlier in the week that was essentially insinuating that the Wii and the 360 were too pricey.

75
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:59,277
[SPEAKER_12]: The maker of the most expensive console...

76
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,882
[SPEAKER_12]: for the next gen says the Wii and the 360 are too pricey.

77
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:03,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, whatever.

78
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:06,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he further clarified his statements later in the week, but this is what he said.

79
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:16,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Quote, sorry you didn't have the opportunity to buy a PlayStation 3 this year, but I'm sure it beats lining up in a queue for hours on end only to be told the store has sold out.

80
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:17,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

81
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:21,335
[SPEAKER_12]: No doubt in response to the delays over in Europe and some of the other countries.

82
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,857
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, too bad you didn't have that opportunity to do that now.

83
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:25,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry.

84
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Your opportunity is coming soon.

85
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:35,942
[SPEAKER_12]: This just goes, look, again, I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is going to be a just fine system.

86
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:38,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Give it a little, it's like a fine wine, it'll age just fine.

87
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:42,467
[SPEAKER_12]: But Sony executives, seriously, gag order.

88
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:47,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, Sony, if you're listening, you need all these people to STFU.

89
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:59,180
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to get a public figure that, you know, is not going to be a laughing stock of the internet, such as Reggie Miyamoto over there, or Major Nelson, Peter Moore over here.

90
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony needs somebody like that.

91
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:13,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll tell you what, it's not this guy, it's not the giant enemy crab guy, who, as I hear, has suffered so much embarrassment from that, he doesn't do public appearances anymore.

92
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,568
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel bad for him, almost, in a way.

93
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,109
[SPEAKER_12]: His bosses probably made him do that.

94
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,030
[SPEAKER_12]: And Kaz.

95
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sure they, like, leave giant enemy crabs at his desk and stuff like that.

96
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:24,854
[SPEAKER_11]: You know that game's just never going to come out now.

97
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,736
[SPEAKER_12]: or if it does come out, that'll be on the big sticker.

98
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:40,442
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be one of those things like the movie Showgirls where at this point it should just be self-aware of the joke that it is now and just market itself as, hey, we're that historically accurate game with the crabs.

99
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:44,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they could just say the game caught crabs.

100
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,465
[SPEAKER_11]: He goes to his doctor for a physical.

101
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:47,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got bad news for you.

102
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,506
[SPEAKER_11]: You have giant enemy crabs.

103
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:50,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Poor guy.

104
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:52,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

105
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:53,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Now when I play a PS3 title...

106
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:33,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I simply can't depend on having a single friends list so I'm going to go manage the master list which should have presence in every PS3 title and X-Fire will be a plugin that some publishers integrate into some games and some won't.

107
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:36,907
[SPEAKER_11]: That means gamers can't depend on finding their friends in one place.

108
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:48,816
[SPEAKER_11]: And he goes on talking about more other stuff and talking about how X-Fire is going to cost money because they're licensing it and stuff and what's that going to do with the whole service and the fact that we haven't really heard much about

109
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,448
[SPEAKER_11]: and their online service.

110
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so who knows?

111
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,312
[SPEAKER_12]: So some fair equal time type stories here.

112
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:59,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft's doing some of the smack talking too.

113
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:12,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe should be leaving the PR to folks like Major Nelson and maybe some of the underground communities, the huge Xbox fan communities out there, some of our other friendly podcasts such as Gamer Tag and XBL.

114
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:15,524
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is some other interesting stuff though.

115
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:27,217
[SPEAKER_11]: This is funny because as soon as they ran this, that of course someone had to come to Sony's defense and that they did.

116
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:43,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, they were talking about some of the information and they also posted in their blog saying there's some bad information there responding to the blog post that I'll get to in a sec.

117
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,443
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was interesting to me in...

118
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,136
[SPEAKER_11]: X-Fire Friends List Online President Smed

119
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:17,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Sony.

120
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:17,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat this crayon.

121
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:19,033
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

122
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:25,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, let's go from all these smack-talking executives to you guys smack-talking us in our mailbag.

123
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:26,259
[SPEAKER_12]: No, just kidding.

124
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,080
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't gotten a lot of hate mail recently, have we?

125
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

126
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:29,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's good.

127
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:29,802
[SPEAKER_12]: That's good.

128
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,303
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad you guys have been nice and polite.

129
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,123
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate that.

130
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:33,925
[SPEAKER_12]: You can send us an email.

131
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:36,246
[SPEAKER_12]: It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

132
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:38,188
[SPEAKER_12]: And every week, Dark Sakura suits up.

133
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:39,712
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com Send us more.

134
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:34,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the first email actually comes from Orko4, basically saying that in Hickory, North Carolina, there was a restaurant called Tallywhackers, me bringing up how they should make peckers as a thing to Hooters, and that the owner wanted the waiters to be shirtless and wearing Speedos, but they couldn't for health violations, so they wore really tight-ass shorts and tank tops.

135
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:37,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, I remember you talking about the male Hooters a couple weeks ago.

136
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:38,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder why.

137
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,363
[SPEAKER_06]: and the last line says, keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear the Doctor Who website of the week.

138
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:48,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not Doctor Who this week, so it's Torchwood.

139
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:50,447
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a spin-off.

140
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:51,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

141
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:54,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Next comes from Mike.

142
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:56,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

143
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,355
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day I saw a Nintendo presentation on game trailers.

144
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that how it really started off?

145
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:01,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey!

146
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:05,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Suddenly it's that little fairy that follows you in The Legend of Zelda.

147
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey!

148
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen!

149
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:06,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

150
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:07,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen!

151
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen!

152
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:12,578
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I want you all to open up your emails from now on.

153
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:13,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, listen!

154
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, to continue.

155
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:25,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's said that the price points for the virtual console, 500, 700, and 1,000 points are actually worded as starting at points.

156
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:29,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So, does this mean that we could be paying $15 for a Nintendo 64 game?

157
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:30,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to hear your thoughts.

158
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:32,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly.

159
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:34,284
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

160
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:35,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be behind him.

161
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:38,457
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I was just thinking about, though?

162
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:43,842
[SPEAKER_12]: If Ocarina of Time does come to Virtual Console, why would I get that?

163
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:47,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I have the little GameCube disc that had it on there.

164
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:50,107
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a limited release, so whatever.

165
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:52,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $10.

166
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,933
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was $5 for NES, $8 for Super Nintendo, $10 for Nintendo 64.

167
00:13:56,973 --> 00:13:57,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Another email from Michael.

168
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:09,714
[SPEAKER_06]: This is HeySky, Loki, and DarkSakura, and maybe Drew Nami, who is not here tonight.

169
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:11,194
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in our chat room.

170
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:12,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop that.

171
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:13,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop what?

172
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:21,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

173
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, only you can see this.

174
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Loki can see it too, but it's aimed toward you.

175
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:25,121
[SPEAKER_12]: I see.

176
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:25,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

177
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:26,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that your IQ?

178
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:26,781
[SPEAKER_12]: One?

179
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:27,702
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

180
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:28,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Mail?

181
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:29,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Email?

182
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:33,985
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, I'd like to say that I love your show.

183
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:34,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

184
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:40,696
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've been listening on the podcast stream for a year and a few months and I most recently listened live last week.

185
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:50,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, I was the one who called in and hung up Tasete Purim, I guess I said that.

186
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Latin.

187
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't take Latin, sorry.

188
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:55,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he's actually renamed himself in chat to just call me Mike.

189
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:56,843
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll call him Mike.

190
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:57,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mike.

191
00:14:58,324 --> 00:14:58,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

192
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:01,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to mute the live stream while using Skype.

193
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:01,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

194
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:01,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

195
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:05,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, earlier on Xbox, what's up with me?

196
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:08,787
[SPEAKER_06]: On episode 203, sports games came up.

197
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:11,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the hosts on OLR aren't sports games fans.

198
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,951
[SPEAKER_06]: You said that sports games are just a roster update.

199
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the same can be said about music games.

200
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:22,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, games like DDR have a few very marginal new innovations, but for the most part, the games are just the same damn thing with new music.

201
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:31,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And to some idiotic gamers, they just hear weird Japanese techno and they think it's the same damn thing with the same music and a new number after the title.

202
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,915
[SPEAKER_06]: While I disagree with both arguments, I think that both make a valid point.

203
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:37,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's my call to the game developers and producers.

204
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:39,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make a new game until it's ready.

205
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, your game can have all the songs of players in the world, but don't put it out until it is better than its predecessor.

206
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:50,845
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly what they're doing at 3D Realms.

207
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:52,626
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

208
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:56,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Duke Nukem Forever.

209
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:58,329
[SPEAKER_11]: They're making sure that it's ready.

210
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the email done?

211
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:00,351
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

212
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:00,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

213
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:06,327
[SPEAKER_06]: This goes for all games, not just music or sports games.

214
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the Halo franchise, for example.

215
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:09,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo 1, a masterpiece.

216
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo 2, an Unreal Tournament skin.

217
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, I play Halo 2 almost exclusively.

218
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:17,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo 2 has pushed out the door too quickly, and just for live experience.

219
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:21,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo 2 was an unsatisfying game that could have been even better than the original.

220
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:25,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the master of re-releasing a game, whether it needs to be or not.

221
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:25,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Slug.

222
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Metal Slug.

223
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It rocks.

224
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:56,151
[SPEAKER_06]: but when it's been pushed toward me on every available medium with no new features it makes me never want to buy a Metal Slug game again even if it has every feature in the world I love Metal Slug anyway game developers need to realize something sure you release the sequel to a good game it sells well but what if you want to make it a trilogy is it accepted or is it looked on as milking the franchise it makes sense in the short term but in one of the worst options in the long run

225
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:04,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Soon gamers will get smart and realize they are being scammed by buying the same game every year.

226
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to tell this to anyone who will listen.

227
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, I think it's too late.

228
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:09,384
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

229
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry if I'm sending you this email again.

230
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:11,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It said the first one.

231
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, I didn't get the first one.

232
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:13,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

233
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:20,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I thought it was a pretty clever comparison, the whole roster update versus the music games.

234
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:21,748
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think...

235
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,756
[SPEAKER_12]: For that, it really depends on what you're into.

236
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't hate sports games.

237
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,961
[SPEAKER_12]: I just recognize that that's not what I'm into.

238
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:36,627
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure for most of them, maybe dance games isn't really what they're into.

239
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:44,294
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they wouldn't recognize the fact that the new dance games do go through interface upgrades and usually there's a new mode in them somewhere.

240
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:48,037
[SPEAKER_12]: And certainly the entire list of songs gets refreshed with

241
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:49,353
[SPEAKER_12]: and so on and so on.

242
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:51,054
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to bore you to death with the comparisons.

243
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:55,235
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an interesting analogy, but I think us being fans of dance games, we don't see that.

244
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:57,536
[SPEAKER_12]: You or other sports games fans, you don't see the comparison.

245
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,615
[SPEAKER_12]: That either, that the rest of us just see the roster update or whatever.

246
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, I think it's exactly the same thing.

247
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:20,538
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, that neither of the games have, you know, very, you know, huge improvements.

248
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Granted, sports games go through, you know, graphical improvements and stuff and roster updates.

249
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:33,726
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, this is even coming from people, you know, reviewing, you know, the brand new EA lineup or whatever that they aren't really adding anything new and it really just is a roster update.

250
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:39,049
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, that's something that they need to prove in both, you know, dance games and, you know,

251
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Sports Games, and probably a lot of other games.

252
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like, what, God of War 2?

253
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:48,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that looks basically like kind of an update, you know, to God of War 1.

254
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:52,559
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, look at... Oh, a lot of games are like that nowadays, you know.

255
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room has an interesting point.

256
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Roster updates don't really change the gameplay all too much.

257
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:01,406
[SPEAKER_12]: New music and music games do change gameplay a bit.

258
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:04,988
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to learn new steps and that sort to the new songs.

259
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:07,510
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't really change much for roster updates.

260
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:08,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Well,

261
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:15,807
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, even the sports games do get some new modes, you know, for their respective games just once in a while.

262
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:16,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like the dance games, you know.

263
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:22,829
[SPEAKER_12]: For instance, we know that in the new Xbox ones, we're going to have the non-stop mixes and things like that.

264
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:24,930
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

265
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,930
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my thoughts.

266
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we also got another email from Rini.

267
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:35,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a fairly long one, so just to sort of paraphrase a bit, it's going into...

268
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:39,763
[SPEAKER_06]: More innovation in the DDR series of games.

269
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:41,984
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to start from here.

270
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I want to read the first one just because it was really nice.

271
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:47,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Good day to OLR and happy belated episode 203.

272
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,027
[SPEAKER_06]: May you have another 396 more at this point and beyond.

273
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:52,948
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really sweet.

274
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:53,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

275
00:19:54,268 --> 00:20:04,692
[SPEAKER_06]: So to continue on toward the middle part of this letter, there was some discussion going on in the Aaron in Japan and DDR UK forums that started to see what users had in mind

276
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:08,327
[SPEAKER_06]: for some realistic and reasonable feature additions that can be added to DDR.

277
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:12,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to make things brisk with a few suggestions made by the community.

278
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:17,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Preview background mode and steps at the song wheel and maybe at the modifier screen.

279
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:31,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Challenge steps for every song in the sense that they would not only give something for expert players but would also bring out the full potential of the song according to Konami so that we don't have the boring as hell licenses from the arcade supernova that has gaps of nothing for no reason.

280
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:36,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Wave Break, 0.25 and half speed, why hasn't Konami put these in?

281
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:41,710
[SPEAKER_06]: If Vulture Mix 3 allows 0.5 speed and phantom modifiers, then why can't the PS2 versions have them?

282
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:51,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Custom courses set on a home version can be used at the arcade with the ability to include any song available on the arcade machine.

283
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:59,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Also should have a maximum of 4 songs on non-stop mode to allow modifiers and a max of 5 songs on challenge mode that disallows modifiers for these courses.

284
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Trade edit data online and at the arcade.

285
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:05,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Submit arcade score data online through a home version by way of memory card.

286
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:08,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are some good suggestions.

287
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:18,669
[SPEAKER_12]: They are, you know, they are good suggestions and certainly we've thought, you know, through the show, many years we've been doing the show, a lot of you guys when you've called in said very similar things.

288
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:20,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

289
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I would think that maybe we're going to get another arcade release.

290
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:52,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

291
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,834
[SPEAKER_12]: I think either way it's inevitable we're going to see Supernova 2 or something like that next year.

292
00:21:55,914 --> 00:22:00,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Because with the leftover songs that you didn't get from the arcade this year at least.

293
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:05,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going to put this one up on our site, but there is a last paragraph on here.

294
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:14,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, the emails that I post are going to be on the live show discussion area on our forums.

295
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:15,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

296
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:53,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Fake Boobs in Playboy OLR's enemy, G4, is finally mostly gone Yes, I know the words G4 are banned from OLR but for now we might not need to talk about them much anymore

297
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:19,318
[SPEAKER_12]: This is all I'm going to say on this because you're right, those words are banned from this network.

298
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:26,007
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of people are saying it's definitely the doom and gloom of the network.

299
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:30,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's more the doom and gloom of the network as a gaming network.

300
00:23:30,632 --> 00:23:31,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

301
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:53,329
[SPEAKER_12]: That channel has not been a gaming channel for the past 18 months.

302
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Where have you been?

303
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,272
[SPEAKER_12]: This is still not news.

304
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:00,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So what they're doing a corporate restructuring around there.

305
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:01,256
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to save them.

306
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:04,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Flush that shit down the toilet and be done with it.

307
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:08,022
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a quote on here, though, that I knew it from the get-go.

308
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:09,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree with the vision.

309
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:15,549
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually a quote from the Ian Stile chief, Ted Harbert.

310
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree with the vision of going after young men more than going after gaming.

311
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaming has been demonstrated as being too narrow.

312
00:24:24,103 --> 00:24:25,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Narrow my ass!

313
00:24:27,724 --> 00:24:28,824
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of gamers out there.

314
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:29,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Text email, please.

315
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:36,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Just more... No offense to the men listening and the men in the room, but stupid men.

316
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:36,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

317
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:37,907
Well.

318
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:39,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean you guys.

319
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:43,950
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are fairly liberated in your mental states, and so are our listeners.

320
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Kisses.

321
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:46,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that all the email?

322
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:47,128
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

323
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:48,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well then get to the next one.

324
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,489
[SPEAKER_12]: We're out of time here.

325
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my voice is running out.

326
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR.

327
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:54,672
[SPEAKER_06]: This, by the way, comes from Kenji.

328
00:24:55,772 --> 00:24:59,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I just picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and I cannot emphasize this enough.

329
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:02,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It is definitely a must-buy if you've got a hookup to the Wi-Fi connection.

330
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:10,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the bowling physics are awful, you can't go all in, and you can bet yourself out of a negative chip score.

331
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing 9-ball is similar to playing the game underwater or in space, take your pick.

332
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:17,056
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't deny the infinite replayability of this game.

333
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, you can pick to chat via Wi-Fi.

334
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:21,939
[SPEAKER_06]: It can only be, however, on matches with your friends.

335
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:26,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, you can pick to via local wireless play and chat with your present messages on WorldFi Wi-Fi.

336
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:27,942
[SPEAKER_12]: So, DMN lied to us last week?

337
00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:31,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, he had the game before most people.

338
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,385
[SPEAKER_12]: He had the game before most people, so he probably didn't have friends on Wi-Fi yet.

339
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:34,925
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that makes sense.

340
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,106
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes me want to buy the game, though.

341
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:37,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

342
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:38,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Dirty Wi-Fi.

343
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Dirty Wi-Fi chat?

344
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:41,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that would be fun.

345
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:42,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

346
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It is because of the awesomeness of this game that I come to you with a request, nay, a favor.

347
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:53,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to make an OLR Clubhouse Games Night where we all exchange friend codes, make a date and time, and basically play the night away.

348
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:59,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps you'd all like to participate, you being Jamie, Skye, and Loki, and you also being the rest of the people listening.

349
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:05,278
[SPEAKER_06]: At long last, Picto-chatting Drop 4 Biatch can become a reality, but only with your help.

350
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:07,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I've left a post in the forums for anyone who's interested.

351
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:08,734
[SPEAKER_06]: As always, love the show.

352
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:09,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Kenji.

353
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:22,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so you know, I did see that post earlier in the week, and I actually just moved it to the OL Army forums because it's kind of fit a little more with that because we try to create teams in certain games that will follow the cardinal rule of the OL Army is don't be a dick.

354
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:30,685
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just want people to join up that just want to have fun and not try to have that elitist attitude or like, you know, my plus four sword can beat your plus two sword.

355
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:31,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Who cares?

356
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,047
[SPEAKER_12]: Get in the game and have fun with it.

357
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Put your plus four sword in your pants.

358
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,428
[SPEAKER_12]: That's exactly right.

359
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:38,991
[SPEAKER_12]: So I actually moved that post over to the OL Army and I posted my code there.

360
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:40,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you want to add, that would be cool.

361
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,594
[SPEAKER_12]: And certainly we could set up a night for gaming.

362
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:48,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it could be a tie-in with one of the live shows that we do during the week because a lot of people don't know.

363
00:26:48,978 --> 00:26:50,179
[SPEAKER_12]: There are shows we do on Orange Launch Radio.

364
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,901
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't podcast because we like to be a live radio network.

365
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:59,304
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura has her thing on Tuesdays and I have a show on Wednesdays and there may be more shows coming soon.

366
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:04,125
[SPEAKER_12]: We know Loki's got something in the works and there's something else I'm trying to get on board.

367
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:04,546
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

368
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:15,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming from GS191, we got a really long email but I thought it was very cool and have posted it on that thread that I mentioned prior on there so I'd

369
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,290
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd love to get some discussion started up on that.

370
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,631
[SPEAKER_06]: The other emails that I was going to post up to you will be coming.

371
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:25,073
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just been, like I said, I've had a sinus infection the last week, so I haven't really done much of anything.

372
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:25,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuses, excuses.

373
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:26,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

374
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:28,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like the sinus infection?

375
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:29,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

376
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:30,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to see you on erythromycin.

377
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:32,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Not really.

378
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:34,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and I would really love to see you on erythromycin.

379
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:37,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, he who shall not be named.

380
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:39,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else for emails?

381
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:40,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

382
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:42,474
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn, we got a lot of emails this week.

383
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:43,575
[SPEAKER_06]: They love us.

384
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:44,936
[SPEAKER_06]: One more.

385
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Last email, we gotta keep moving.

386
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:46,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

387
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:48,920
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one that came on through Myspace.

388
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, okay, yes, I remember this one.

389
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:52,083
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a Myspace message.

390
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Gally from Breakdown Radio.

391
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:56,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, Gally here from the Breakdown.

392
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:58,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a big fan of the show and you guys rock soars big time.

393
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:02,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I didn't send this to your mailbag, but I think I'm being yelled at by the boss right now.

394
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:03,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn the man.

395
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:09,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, with all this talk of the Wii 60 going down, do you guys think it's a smart move on a personal level?

396
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:14,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys already have 360s, but try and look at it from the perspective of a gamer who has neither yet?

397
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:24,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it would be a wise move to do the Wii 60, stick with one of the two, or is the last alternative, which I highly doubt because of Sakura's crayon-eating references, holding out for the PS3?

398
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:26,542
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

399
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:46,747
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

400
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:05,315
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you are not rich and you only have the choice, you know, do I want to get a PS3 or do I want to do the Wii 60 thing?

401
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:07,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Or hell, can I really only pick one of these?

402
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:11,599
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you really have to consider what games do you want to play.

403
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:19,324
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think especially right now between Wii and Xbox 360, there's vastly different games available on the two systems.

404
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:26,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So you really have to ask yourself, am I wanting to do the wavy controller, Elebits, Zelda, WarioWare type of game?

405
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:39,413
[SPEAKER_12]: or do I want to get online and play Gears of War and soon Halo 3 and maybe some games like Enchanted Arms or NFL, NBA type games that are available on Xbox 360.

406
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:40,774
[SPEAKER_12]: You really have to consider.

407
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:49,897
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the way PlayStation 3 works into it is that even though a lot of games that we're hearing are kind of the same things we saw on Xbox 360, i.e.

408
00:29:50,097 --> 00:29:55,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Oblivion and so on, they are going to have their own games eventually that stand out.

409
00:29:56,581 --> 00:30:06,362
[SPEAKER_12]: My personal mindset is that you don't need to get a PlayStation 3 right out the gate, but I say that because for me, there's no games on this yet that I have to have.

410
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,541
[SPEAKER_12]: A year from now, I'm probably going to feel a lot differently.

411
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,522
[SPEAKER_12]: By the time Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4 start hitting the market, you know what?

412
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,422
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm probably going to be Sony fanboy all over again.

413
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:18,103
[SPEAKER_12]: But as far as the launch goes, I'm not really sold.

414
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:25,984
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you think you're going to have some money now and then more money in a year and PlayStation 3 doesn't have the lineup for you right now, do what I'm doing.

415
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:33,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Buy the Wii now so you have your Wii 6 because I bought the Xbox 360 six months ago so it's spaced out enough where this isn't a huge financial impact.

416
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Buy the Wii when it comes out and then buy the PlayStation 3 later down the line.

417
00:30:37,079 --> 00:31:04,007
[SPEAKER_12]: but you know again it's up to you and what games you want to play and there's no real clear answer we can give we can only tell you based on what we play but there's going to be so many fanboys that say no you have to have one of these on launch because you have to have Lair and Warhawk and Six Axes for Life and yada yada yada but it's all about what you want well from my perspective I'm getting them all anyway so I'd say if you can get them all get them all that way you're not limited

418
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:32,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft says I've said it before and I'll say it again I'll get a 360 just to play Uno you might be being sarcastic but you're really wasting your time if that's all you want because you can play it for free on Zone MSN or hell Clubhouse Games has something just like it so if now you must have strip Uno with the webcam well I suppose the 360 is the only place you can do that I don't know Rama says PlayStation 3 will be bringing it back to the store after it breaks in 20 minutes hey you know what

419
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:34,467
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something to be said, too.

420
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:37,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you don't want to get a first-generation worth of console.

421
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:39,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I learned my lesson with the Xbox 360.

422
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Go back and listen to some episodes around February when I bought my Xbox 360.

423
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:45,454
[SPEAKER_12]: The damn thing broke when I bought it, and I was pissed.

424
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:51,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was going to go torch down Microsoft, but since then they fixed it for free, and I've been a happy boy.

425
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I did also want to make an announcement, though.

426
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:54,220
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

427
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:58,282
[SPEAKER_06]: For Pump Up the Volume, actually, this week.

428
00:31:58,422 --> 00:31:59,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Your Tuesday show, yes.

429
00:31:59,263 --> 00:31:59,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

430
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

431
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:03,229
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be a delay on the show.

432
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:06,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be starting around 7.30 to 8 this week.

433
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:10,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to go ahead and make a mention that I am doing it.

434
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:11,274
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

435
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:13,755
[SPEAKER_12]: So come listen to the other live programming on Orange Launch Radio.

436
00:32:15,036 --> 00:32:15,837
[SPEAKER_12]: All done with the mailbag?

437
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

438
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:20,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

439
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to more gaming news.

440
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,024
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a movie called 8-Bit under development.

441
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:27,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh.

442
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:37,350
[SPEAKER_12]: According to VH1's Game Break, quote, this movie is about how games affect our culture, how the genre crosses the culture to influence music, art, and the way we think.

443
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:43,580
[SPEAKER_12]: In 8-bit, artists invade the online shooter Counter-Strike to add messages of peace on walls with paintball guns.

444
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

445
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:11,432
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of weird that I've never heard of any of this stuff.

446
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:13,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, I've heard of the music, certainly.

447
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:17,354
[SPEAKER_12]: We know a lot of those bands, but I haven't heard of any of those other art projects, so that might be worth checking out.

448
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:18,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard the Game Boy one.

449
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:18,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

450
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:20,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, yeah, the Game Boy music one, yeah.

451
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:29,240
[SPEAKER_12]: We've also had bands that use the type of... I'm talking about like the Counter-Strike, Grandpa and the Fire thing, and the whole... those sort of things.

452
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,200
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never heard of that before.

453
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,261
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be interesting.

454
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:36,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, shooting paintballs into a wall does not make for a winning team.

455
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,411
[SPEAKER_12]: But when it's, you know, it's an interesting kind of art form when it's done in a game, huh?

456
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:42,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe?

457
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,072
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very unique.

458
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:59,377
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's also kind of neat, and it's one of the rumors that's going to be coming soon, and you might actually be able to watch 8-Bit on this, that Microsoft might be adding Xvid and DivX support to the 360 in the fall dashboard update.

459
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:05,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, no idea whether it's true or not, but the news actually comes from

460
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:12,322
[SPEAKER_11]: A developers conference that was going on actually.

461
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:28,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Some Dutch colleagues from xlife.nl were invited to a training session for shop employees and basically kind of just talking a little bit about technology and stuff.

462
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:39,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the questions that was asked basically at the event, they had a talk with the host and asked him whether there's going to be DivX or Xvid support in the future or other codecs.

463
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:45,936
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said that it was something that Microsoft was working hard to implement and a firmware update is expected within two months.

464
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:48,897
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll have to see.

465
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:51,218
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be rumor for now.

466
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,459
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would make sense if they supported something like that.

467
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:55,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they will, though.

468
00:34:56,812 --> 00:35:04,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that's not a rumor is a new multiplayer mode for Red Steel is going to be called Killer Mode.

469
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:12,819
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a special multiplayer setup, so you'll use your mission brief via the speaker in the Wiimote.

470
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is a B.

471
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:25,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was hearing something about this, that, like, basically, like, I think the Wiimote is supposed to ring, and so you put it up to your ear, and it'll actually whisper, like, you know, This is Snake.

472
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:31,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you need, no, it says something like, you need to kill player four and do not kill the other players, or something like that.

473
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:34,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, it gives you your mission in a little speaker so the other people don't know what your mission is.

474
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:35,335
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.

475
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:36,736
[SPEAKER_12]: That is damn innovative, isn't it?

476
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:37,677
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty fun.

477
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:38,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that.

478
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:39,658
[SPEAKER_12]: That is pretty cool.

479
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,340
[SPEAKER_12]: That's innovation.

480
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that.

481
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:43,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

482
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:43,962
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

483
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,275
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

484
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:06,951
[SPEAKER_11]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

485
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,841
[SPEAKER_11]: And this, I think, is going to be kind of very similar to that.

486
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:30,222
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be talking a little bit more, I think, about releasing games.

487
00:36:30,382 --> 00:36:37,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, you see some of the stuff, not necessarily old games on Xbox Live Arcade, but newer games that are small, maybe for that kind of setup.

488
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:42,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't see this really replacing the current distribution we have now.

489
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:49,528
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's interesting because, you know, you've heard a lot of talk about this whole digital distribution moving on into the next gaming area, especially on PlayStation 3 as well.

490
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:50,949
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a quote here.

491
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:51,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me read this real fast.

492
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:56,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is from, I believe this is from Nintendo themselves.

493
00:36:56,326 --> 00:37:06,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Beginning in Spring 2007, Nintendo will apparently begin the Wii Compact Software line of games which will allow players to download certain Wii titles to their console rather than purchasing a disc.

494
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:10,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Pricing and storage details, as well as what software will be made available, not provided.

495
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:11,263
[SPEAKER_11]: and New Cables and Whatnot.

496
00:37:40,987 --> 00:38:00,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyways, there's some interesting stuff also coming out about the Wii, and I know one of the stories that was run during the week when talking about how Sunlight was causing a problem with the Wii remotes where it was interfering with the IR field that the actual receiver and emitters were putting out.

497
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, apparently Nintendo has commented on that, and they said that it's not a major issue.

498
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:12,548
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, our testing thus far shows no great risk of light interference while playing a game that relies on the pointer and sensor bar.

499
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:22,175
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, granted, that's going to be about as much interference as having, you know, bright light shining on your TV or something like that.

500
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:24,417
[SPEAKER_11]: That won't really interfere with it.

501
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:27,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm, you know, kind of on the fence with this.

502
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:28,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we'll have to see when it comes out.

503
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:30,138
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what, though?

504
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:39,643
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's anything to be learned from this, especially from the eye toy and from the Xbox Live Vision camera, my house is always too dark.

505
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think too much light is ever going to be a problem.

506
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:47,226
[SPEAKER_12]: JeremyTub1 in chat says, Who gives a shit if sunlight affects it?

507
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:48,207
[SPEAKER_12]: You aren't playing outside.

508
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:50,668
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's shining through a window, close the freaking blinds.

509
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:54,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Minini283 says, Everyone plays games in their basements anyway.

510
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,111
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I play in my living room.

511
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:57,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

512
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:00,243
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was a joke about nerds there.

513
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:32,640
[SPEAKER_06]: This website of the week was actually one given to me by our dear friend and listener, Rob with two B's.

514
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll spell it out.

515
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:41,447
[SPEAKER_06]: It's theca.com, which is for the Entertainment Consumers Association.

516
00:39:45,912 --> 00:39:54,602
[SPEAKER_06]: The Entertainment Consumers Association is a non-profit membership organization established to serve the needs of those who play computer and video games.

517
00:39:55,623 --> 00:40:01,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Formed in 2006, the ECA is an advocacy organization for consumers of interactive entertainment.

518
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:04,017
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually sign up for their site.

519
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:05,078
[SPEAKER_06]: They have things to win.

520
00:40:05,118 --> 00:40:08,100
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have lots of information.

521
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Links to game politics, too.

522
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:12,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems that there's a little bit of an affiliation there.

523
00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:15,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Just lots of really good stuff.

524
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:20,568
[SPEAKER_06]: FAQs, news, just things that are going on as far as our legal rights as gamers.

525
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:23,750
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, there's another blurb on here.

526
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:31,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Today, more than ever before, gamers need to stand together to defend against political activity that is threatening the creation and publishing of video games.

527
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:40,620
[SPEAKER_06]: On behalf of the gaming community, the ECA lobbies legislators directly as well as launching grassroots digital initiatives to preserve our rights as gamers.

528
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:42,462
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that link again?

529
00:40:43,062 --> 00:40:45,905
[SPEAKER_06]: It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com.

530
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:48,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, check it out boys and girls.

531
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:50,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, I'll be linking it in the chat room.

532
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:59,737
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, GameTap is a service we've mentioned a few times on this show, and it's, you know, still getting a little steam, a few more subscribers every now and then.

533
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:08,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they have launched a 500-player beta of Uru Live, which you might know also as the Myst Online Project.

534
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:15,588
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a pretty big deal, because what happened is the project was abandoned, and then GameTap has kind of picked it up and ran with it, so it's kind of interesting.

535
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:28,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Gay Gamer recently ran a report on this, and they said this, quote, GameTap has improved the game with new sound support and a new physics engine that makes it much easier and faster to interact with others, something that bogged down the original game.

536
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:34,920
[SPEAKER_12]: And if things go as planned, Uru Live may begin to incorporate content generated by its incredibly creative player community.

537
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

538
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:36,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

539
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:36,982
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty cool.

540
00:41:37,082 --> 00:41:40,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they keep doing more stuff like that and supporting smaller games and maybe helping in

541
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:43,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Some PC games get published and stuff like that.

542
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:48,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what's kind of neat about that too is that you're paying essentially the GameTap fee for access to all this.

543
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:51,783
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they get more MMOs, it's kind of like you're paying one fee for all these MMOs.

544
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:53,585
[SPEAKER_12]: And GameTap is relatively cheap.

545
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,307
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same price they're charging for Phantasy Star Universe.

546
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:01,051
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to sound like a commercial because I've already been accused of being on their payroll.

547
00:42:03,793 --> 00:42:08,657
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually pay the $10 a month for GameTap, which is sad because I rarely ever use it because I'm just so

548
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,473
[SPEAKER_12]: I check it out like once every other week or so to see what's new.

549
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,115
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is something I definitely will check out.

550
00:42:15,735 --> 00:42:16,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very curious.

551
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:19,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously I can't get into beta, but when it's released.

552
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:32,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, this week Unfettered Blather, a blogging site, actually ran a top ten list of the top ten things about next gen that are annoying.

553
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:35,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's go off the list here.

554
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,352
[SPEAKER_11]: The big highlights, of course, number one,

555
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:39,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony's alternate reality.

556
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:43,358
[SPEAKER_11]: No matter how you spin it, we just want a game console first.

557
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Go push your format war somewhere else.

558
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:50,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, dual price skew nonsense with the new next-gen console.

559
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:50,761
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, though?

560
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:56,944
[SPEAKER_12]: If you read those stories about people who are pre-ordering the PS3, some of them were doing it because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.

561
00:42:57,144 --> 00:42:59,925
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if number one has as much validity as people think.

562
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:00,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

563
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:01,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

564
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:05,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Cost between consoles and computers vanishing.

565
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:09,856
[SPEAKER_11]: $60 games, expensive peripherals, consoles being released at $600 price points.

566
00:43:10,977 --> 00:43:20,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Chasing Nintendo says you just can't ignore the changes in industry, but sure fun watching these two megacorporations scramble to keep up with Nintendo's ideas.

567
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:23,942
[SPEAKER_11]: And other fun stuff, they're also on there.

568
00:43:25,042 --> 00:43:31,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Mainly repeating the $60 game thing, and name changes, like they're saying the Revolution was a better name, and

569
00:43:32,013 --> 00:43:34,194
[SPEAKER_12]: That $60 game thing should have been number one.

570
00:43:34,254 --> 00:43:35,755
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the most annoying, if anything.

571
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:36,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.

572
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:40,318
[SPEAKER_11]: $60 would have made my list.

573
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,260
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't really seen that whole Gran Turismo thing, though.

574
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,781
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we've really seen what exactly is going to come of that.

575
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:46,241
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

576
00:43:48,022 --> 00:43:48,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

577
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:49,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

578
00:43:50,484 --> 00:43:56,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if you have more annoying things, you could maybe write this guy and maybe he'll do an extended list in the future.

579
00:43:57,492 --> 00:44:05,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, in regards to, you know, we had brought up there was going to be a Castlevania movie, right?

580
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:09,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's going to be written by Warren Ellis.

581
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:10,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool, huh?

582
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:14,080
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, it is going to be direct-to-DVD.

583
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

584
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:18,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Direct-to-DVD, that's not good.

585
00:44:20,097 --> 00:44:22,137
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been some good things put direct to DVD.

586
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:24,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it kind of seems to be one place the movie industry is going.

587
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:27,259
[SPEAKER_12]: You have all these god-awful sequels going direct to DVD.

588
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:30,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Why not, you know, something kind of, you know, new, unique?

589
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you saw Van Helsing, which was kind of Castlevania the movie in a way.

590
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:35,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Not really, just kidding.

591
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:47,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at any rate, there's a quote on here saying, for an entity currently known only as Project 51's productions, a production blog will follow on the official site.

592
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:48,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

593
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,341
[SPEAKER_06]: We just keep our eyes on it to see what happens.

594
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:55,842
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

595
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:56,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll rent it.

596
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it in my Netflix queue.

597
00:44:58,383 --> 00:45:01,764
[SPEAKER_06]: But having him write it, that's like fangasm right there.

598
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:02,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

599
00:45:03,185 --> 00:45:08,207
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to be the... By the way, it is the animated Castlevania thing that we were talking about before.

600
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,588
[SPEAKER_11]: So animated movie, that wouldn't be too bad, I guess.

601
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:11,869
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not live action.

602
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:14,810
[SPEAKER_11]: After all, they are making BloodRayne 2.

603
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, God, do we really need more video game movies like that?

604
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,991
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know.

605
00:45:19,612 --> 00:45:20,372
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be pretty cool.

606
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:22,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here we go.

607
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,512
[SPEAKER_06]: He worked on, he basically was a comic writer.

608
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:33,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Did some work for, I actually did remember that he did work for Excalibur because I've read Excalibur from its beginning incarnation on.

609
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:43,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Did DV8, which was a Gen 13 spinoff, Stormwatch, The Authority, did some stuff for Vertigo, Transmetropolitan was one.

610
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:51,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, did, was working on the Counter-X line of titles for Marvel.

611
00:45:52,947 --> 00:45:57,789
[SPEAKER_06]: X-Men, X-Force, Avatar Comics, Homage Comics, South Park

612
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:22,933
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

613
00:46:52,045 --> 00:47:01,627
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to point out, I watched this week's episode of South Park, and for those folks that heard my review of the WoW episode of South Park last week, that satire I said was missing, that was in this week's episode.

614
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:03,828
[SPEAKER_12]: This week's episode of South Park was freaking hilarious.

615
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:05,748
[SPEAKER_12]: I laughed my ass off.

616
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:08,489
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have a fucked up sense of humor.

617
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:08,989
[SPEAKER_12]: What can I say?

618
00:47:09,669 --> 00:47:13,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think that they probably did that stuff on purpose, or just didn't really give a crap?

619
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,410
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure they did.

620
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, bathroom.

621
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:20,611
[SPEAKER_11]: So then there's another wonderful rumor going around the interweb this week.

622
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:26,020
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be that the sword featured in the actual episode of South Park was a real sword.

623
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:32,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Sword of the 1000 Truths is supposed to be winnable in the arena matches in Burning Crusade.

624
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:38,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people think that it's an obvious Photoshop, but who knows?

625
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:42,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we'll see when Burning Crusade hits stores.

626
00:47:43,316 --> 00:47:44,357
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of interesting, though.

627
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:47,798
[SPEAKER_12]: It actually wouldn't surprise me if that were true.

628
00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:49,700
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually don't think that's a fanboy thing.

629
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:55,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that could actually be true because that episode of South Park felt like such this huge infomercial.

630
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:57,645
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be the perfect tie-in.

631
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:04,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was funny, though, because some of the stats were a little bit different from the actual cartoon.

632
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:07,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, it says 197 to 296 damage, 88 damage per second, plus 21 stamina.

633
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:15,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Requires level 70.

634
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:20,434
[SPEAKER_11]: It says equip improves hit rating by 8, improves critical strike rating by 14.

635
00:48:20,494 --> 00:48:23,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't you go post that on Wikipedia, you damn nerd?

636
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:25,779
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't match what was in the show.

637
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,901
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they already posted that on Wikipedia.

638
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:28,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I see.

639
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:32,285
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that'd be interesting to see if that's going to actually be coming out.

640
00:48:32,305 --> 00:48:33,146
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

641
00:48:34,908 --> 00:48:39,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, looks like those WoW nerds during the correcting needs a clue.

642
00:48:39,772 --> 00:48:40,392
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a clue.

643
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:41,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a raging clue.

644
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:42,614
[SPEAKER_12]: My clue is over there.

645
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:43,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go there.

646
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my, clue goo.

647
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,557
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a raging clue.

648
00:48:47,197 --> 00:48:47,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I get it.

649
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:50,139
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a joke about the South Park from this week.

650
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:50,640
[SPEAKER_12]: That's funny.

651
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job, listeners.

652
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:52,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job.

653
00:48:54,122 --> 00:48:56,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, you know what?

654
00:48:57,164 --> 00:49:00,647
[SPEAKER_12]: You are on an internet radio program about video games.

655
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:02,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're black.

656
00:49:02,788 --> 00:49:03,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey.

657
00:49:04,805 --> 00:49:07,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I calls them as I sees them, dude.

658
00:49:07,908 --> 00:49:14,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you remember my allusion to the Phantom earlier in Part A?

659
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:15,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

660
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay attention, listeners.

661
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:19,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was giving foreshadowing.

662
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:24,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they actually are starting to sell something for Phantom.

663
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:25,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that funny?

664
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:32,567
[SPEAKER_06]: They have been showing off this thing called the Phantom Wireless Lapboard and Phantom Wireless Laser Mouse.

665
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:40,447
[SPEAKER_06]: The two together are basically just a way to sit on your ass and browse the internet with a keyboard.

666
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:48,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Web TV, only with a swivel keyboard thing and a piece of hard plastic underneath it.

667
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,251
[SPEAKER_12]: So is this the next generation of gaming?

668
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:51,471
[SPEAKER_06]: My ass.

669
00:49:53,252 --> 00:49:55,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, Web TV, we've had this shit before.

670
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:57,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But I...

671
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,650
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

672
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:29,613
[SPEAKER_12]: The Get Well Gamers Foundation, it's another nice charity that was posted about a little bit earlier this week on GayGamer.net, quote,

673
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:37,239
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

674
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:03,818
[SPEAKER_12]: and this is the pretty cool thing is that you can actually donate your old games.

675
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:12,764
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, games you might think are old and outdated and you're never going to play anymore, like instead of throwing a Nintendo 64 in the garbage, you could donate it to a charity like this.

676
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:19,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, listen, if you've watched fucking Mind Mancia, you would know that nobody wants a Nintendo 64 anymore.

677
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,991
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just like to point out, in this picture, on this site...

678
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,087
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a child, a sick child, you're playing a Nintendo 64.

679
00:51:26,147 --> 00:51:27,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't he suffered enough?

680
00:51:27,787 --> 00:51:29,487
[SPEAKER_12]: You heartless bastard.

681
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:33,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, I still love Pokemon Snap.

682
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:34,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

683
00:51:34,528 --> 00:51:36,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mario 64 is the shit.

684
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I also threw away a PlayStation.

685
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've done that.

686
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a stack of five of them in my back room.

687
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You heartless both of you.

688
00:51:45,531 --> 00:51:46,111
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't work.

689
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:47,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, come on.

690
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,532
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's broken, then it's broken.

691
00:51:49,832 --> 00:51:52,634
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our old ones, it will still sort of work.

692
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:56,996
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to tilt it sideways at a 45 degree angle for it to read the discs right.

693
00:51:57,336 --> 00:51:58,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll donate mine to this charity.

694
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really play my Nintendo 64.

695
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:01,899
[SPEAKER_12]: My Nintendo 64 was broken.

696
00:52:01,939 --> 00:52:03,980
[SPEAKER_12]: It was all blurry and the polygons were simple.

697
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,880
[SPEAKER_12]: See, now you're making it up.

698
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you're just making stuff up.

699
00:52:07,061 --> 00:52:09,022
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to play Nintendo 64, I'll play my DS.

700
00:52:09,923 --> 00:52:10,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

701
00:52:11,352 --> 00:52:13,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, just admit you're a bad person and get to the next story.

702
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:17,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a bad person, and I have no problems with that.

703
00:52:17,256 --> 00:52:18,757
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a bad, bad man.

704
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:24,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, if it comes, I'm getting my Wii, and I ain't donating shit.

705
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:25,743
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my Wii.

706
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,645
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna, whatever, I'm not gonna say anymore.

707
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:29,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

708
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:30,526
[SPEAKER_11]: You're gonna get cancer.

709
00:52:30,866 --> 00:52:31,907
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just what's gonna happen.

710
00:52:32,447 --> 00:52:32,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It's karma.

711
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:35,049
[SPEAKER_11]: You're gonna die in a fire.

712
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,491
[SPEAKER_11]: You know you really want a 64DD?

713
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:44,717
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we really need to go to the next story at this point.

714
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:49,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, look, we've got one foot in hell, so let's please go to the next story.

715
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:54,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, because in hell, if you throw water on the ground, you're going to get steam.

716
00:52:55,245 --> 00:52:59,329
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my transition, because steam is getting a lot more cool games coming to it.

717
00:53:00,169 --> 00:53:06,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of those games is a fan favorite, Psychonauts, and that's kind of neat.

718
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:11,381
[SPEAKER_11]: and, of course, other things that you're going to be seeing on Steam other than Psychonauts.

719
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:14,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And Psychonauts, by the way, is just going to be about $20.

720
00:53:14,463 --> 00:53:26,329
[SPEAKER_11]: You're also going to see such wonderful games like Call of Duty 2, as well as some other Activision titles, Call of Duty, Call of Duty United Offensive, and Gun.

721
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:33,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are also going to be coming, as well as the brand new game that will also be coming to Xbox Live Arcade someday.

722
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Rebel Blitz is also making its way.

723
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:36,654
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

724
00:53:37,153 --> 00:53:38,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of fun stuff for Steam.

725
00:53:41,156 --> 00:53:42,777
[SPEAKER_06]: They should do a game called Call of Booty.

726
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:45,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Or porn.

727
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,861
[SPEAKER_12]: They have World of Porncraft.

728
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:49,142
[SPEAKER_12]: They should definitely have Call of Booty.

729
00:53:49,622 --> 00:53:52,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of World of... You know what?

730
00:53:52,644 --> 00:53:53,625
[SPEAKER_12]: I should... Okay.

731
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:57,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I have this great entrepreneur idea here.

732
00:53:57,628 --> 00:54:00,290
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to share with the entire internet.

733
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:00,730
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

734
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:01,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Patent pending.

735
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:02,291
[SPEAKER_12]: It's mine.

736
00:54:02,351 --> 00:54:02,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Trademarked.

737
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:03,952
[SPEAKER_12]: You steal this, I sue you.

738
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:04,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, here it is.

739
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:13,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Make a porn company that does nothing but video game tie-ins like that.

740
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:15,275
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's an audience out there for that.

741
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:19,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And we could do both gay, straight, lesbo, whatever, everything.

742
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Trisexual, it doesn't matter.

743
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Furries, sure, we'll find something for you guys too.

744
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:23,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon or something.

745
00:54:24,184 --> 00:54:25,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe like Banjo-Kazooie.

746
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Porn.

747
00:54:27,748 --> 00:54:27,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Porn.

748
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,630
[SPEAKER_12]: FinalFuckX, who doesn't remember that one?

749
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,111
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a great Japanese import.

750
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:59,433
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we need some good domestically made... Really good cosplay.

751
00:54:59,453 --> 00:55:04,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Bring me your whores and your sluts and let's put them in some video game porn.

752
00:55:04,556 --> 00:55:07,758
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll make them stars and make a lot of money in the process.

753
00:55:07,878 --> 00:55:09,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, strippers are people too.

754
00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:10,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Naked people.

755
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:14,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, next story, right?

756
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:18,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to the world of SomethingCraft...

757
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:20,373
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

758
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, it's the chat room.

759
00:55:45,326 --> 00:55:46,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Finish your story, then I'll go back.

760
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:47,387
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just tell me.

761
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:50,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.

762
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:52,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that at a store last week.

763
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:55,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they're going off on all these movies that we could make here.

764
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:57,913
[SPEAKER_12]: We have DMN says Super Princess Penis.

765
00:55:59,074 --> 00:56:01,475
[SPEAKER_12]: DMN says Conker's Bad Furry Day.

766
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:12,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Mantic says Crash Bandicunt, DMN says Elite Beat Off Agents, and Bandit says simply Paris Hilton's Gem Quest.

767
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:14,922
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically porn anyway.

768
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:16,303
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are awesome.

769
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back to my story.

770
00:56:19,484 --> 00:56:20,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Dirty-minded listeners.

771
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Chrome Horse.

772
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Good one, Travis.

773
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:25,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Travis, yes.

774
00:56:27,196 --> 00:56:28,937
[SPEAKER_09]: No more porn, no more porn, sorry.

775
00:56:28,977 --> 00:56:35,358
[SPEAKER_06]: They finished the first step of the character transfer and paid everything on the credit card.

776
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:38,179
[SPEAKER_06]: They said it would take 12 hours to move it.

777
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:43,621
[SPEAKER_06]: They checked again, 12 hours again, 12 hours later, they checked again, and still another 12 hours.

778
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And people on the forums were bitching up a storm.

779
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:52,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, there was a...

780
00:56:53,657 --> 00:56:57,581
[SPEAKER_06]: They were basically putting the same old cut-and-paste response on the forum.

781
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:00,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah, this is normal, working as intended, my butt.

782
00:57:01,283 --> 00:57:02,104
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that type of thing.

783
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:09,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said no one could resolve it by working with their customer service.

784
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:15,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It was suggested canceling the transfer and starting again, and no one else had any luck with it.

785
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:16,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

786
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:19,900
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

787
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:43,358
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was redoing it over and over and over.

788
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:47,982
[SPEAKER_12]: So they encouraged them to retry it, yet it was withdrawing 20 euros every time.

789
00:57:48,022 --> 00:57:49,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it was retrying it on its own.

790
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:50,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, nice.

791
00:57:51,245 --> 00:58:00,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't charging credit cards, like I said, but it was charging debit accounts and draining people's bank accounts.

792
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:03,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So Blizzard hasn't...

793
00:58:05,723 --> 00:58:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: They said that it hasn't worked for about eight days and Blizzard finally came out and said something about it.

794
00:58:11,748 --> 00:58:16,912
[SPEAKER_06]: But there has not been a statement issued by Blizzard.

795
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:21,456
[SPEAKER_06]: There hasn't been an ETA as to when they're going to get that fixed.

796
00:58:21,756 --> 00:58:26,200
[SPEAKER_12]: As I understand it, though, this is only screwing over the Euro banks, not American transfers.

797
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm seeing right here.

798
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

799
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:34,386
[SPEAKER_06]: But they can't just be so closed-mouthed about this.

800
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:35,147
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to be

801
00:58:36,403 --> 00:58:39,305
[SPEAKER_06]: They are going to lose so much freaking business.

802
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:46,171
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, there's any type of number of suits are going to come up over just how much money they've taken from these bank accounts.

803
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,714
[SPEAKER_06]: They've really screwed themselves with this.

804
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:54,218
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see it happening, you stop the service.

805
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:56,040
[SPEAKER_06]: You do it right then.

806
00:58:57,529 --> 00:58:59,430
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, would you watch a movie called Slut Caliber 3?

807
00:58:59,470 --> 00:58:59,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah!

808
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Blackboy says Super Monkey Ball, touch and roll.

809
00:59:33,127 --> 00:59:33,707
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds fun.

810
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:35,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was a game.

811
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:37,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Monkey Ball, touch and roll.

812
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but it could be a porn, too.

813
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:42,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I promised we wouldn't do any more of the porn.

814
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:43,870
[SPEAKER_12]: But some of them are just so damn funny.

815
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,471
[SPEAKER_12]: What can I say?

816
00:59:45,191 --> 00:59:46,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Skype line's open.

817
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:47,952
[SPEAKER_12]: You can call us.

818
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Go to orangeloungeradio.com.

819
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:50,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Click on Interact With Us.

820
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,653
[SPEAKER_12]: The username is OrangeloungeRadio.

821
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:54,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you can pick up the telephone and call 916-226-9067.

822
00:59:57,771 --> 01:00:01,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, in the meantime, some quick last minute stories, some things to squeeze in there.

823
01:00:01,412 --> 01:00:02,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I did want to mention this.

824
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:12,974
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a fan of the game In the Groove, you can now, this latest update they've done on the machine, you can do your own custom MP3s and steps.

825
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:19,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically now you have, In the Groove has basically come out and legitimized itself as Step Mania in the arcade.

826
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:21,356
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only one problem though.

827
01:00:21,436 --> 01:00:23,336
[SPEAKER_11]: What are they going to do for audio licensing?

828
01:00:23,922 --> 01:00:30,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Since I'm sure they didn't address that, since the game is not, you know, these are not licensed on the machine.

829
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:34,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And usually the machine will cover the licensing for the songs that are in the game.

830
01:00:35,012 --> 01:00:42,459
[SPEAKER_11]: But now that place, say if the RIA comes in and hears someone playing, you know, Christina Aguilera or something like that on the machine, they could sue them.

831
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, chat room is correcting me and saying it's actually OGG files.

832
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:46,883
[SPEAKER_12]: We are starting to get some calls.

833
01:00:46,903 --> 01:00:47,843
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll come back to this in a minute.

834
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:49,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

835
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:49,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

836
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:52,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Sephiroth1215 here.

837
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.

838
01:00:53,871 --> 01:00:54,452
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

839
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:59,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty much fresh off of Digital Life.

840
01:01:00,475 --> 01:01:01,916
[SPEAKER_12]: How was Digital Life?

841
01:01:01,976 --> 01:01:03,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell us a little bit about this.

842
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:07,559
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the first time you get in there, it looks kind of cool.

843
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:08,439
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and big.

844
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,442
[SPEAKER_01]: So much to see, but it's really not that great this year.

845
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:13,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

846
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:13,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Why is that?

847
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:16,984
[SPEAKER_01]: You had some good things.

848
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:18,145
[SPEAKER_01]: You had some...

849
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a few gaming booths, depending on what you like, though.

850
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:26,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Digital Life is not exclusively a gaming show, right?

851
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:27,889
[SPEAKER_12]: There's lots of stuff there.

852
01:01:28,729 --> 01:01:30,551
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's plenty of stuff there.

853
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:40,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a lot of the space, though, was from MLG and another gaming league of some sort.

854
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:42,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Was Sony the best booth there?

855
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,864
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

856
01:01:44,676 --> 01:01:46,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's booth was kind of small.

857
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:48,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention it was right next to Microsoft's booth.

858
01:01:49,118 --> 01:01:49,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

859
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:51,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get your hands on the plate?

860
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to play the PS3.

861
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:54,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And?

862
01:01:55,142 --> 01:02:00,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And it played very well from what I got to see.

863
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:00,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

864
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:02,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a little bit of Resistance.

865
01:02:03,706 --> 01:02:05,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that's something they didn't have at E3, I don't think, right?

866
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:06,968
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you think of it?

867
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:09,230
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.

868
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more so looking at the graphics and the movements of the characters...

869
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:16,738
[SPEAKER_01]: More so than the gameplay, though.

870
01:02:17,439 --> 01:02:17,879
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think?

871
01:02:17,939 --> 01:02:19,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Did this sell you on the game?

872
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Or on the system, I should say?

873
01:02:23,062 --> 01:02:37,810
[SPEAKER_01]: It proved to me that the system can be more solid than I originally thought because I thought maybe everything was going to be kind of blocky or it wasn't... I don't know how to explain it, really.

874
01:02:38,831 --> 01:02:42,513
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess just to compare, I got to play the Wii a bit.

875
01:02:43,988 --> 01:02:47,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Elebits, and oddly enough, there were problems playing that.

876
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:48,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what kind of problems?

877
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:51,230
[SPEAKER_01]: The controls were off.

878
01:02:51,370 --> 01:03:02,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you had to stay to the left, and it had the same kind of problem that Sonic did, where you go a little bit, and the cursor goes far off into the screen.

879
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it just maybe miscalibrated?

880
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:06,053
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been.

881
01:03:06,093 --> 01:03:07,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure.

882
01:03:07,614 --> 01:03:12,295
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only a demo of the game, so it could change later.

883
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:19,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention the loading time was way over a minute just to even start the demo.

884
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, so that's interesting.

885
01:03:22,084 --> 01:03:29,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of a different reaction than we heard from E3 where everybody was buzzing about the Wii and not so buzzing about the PS3.

886
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,692
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think was the best thing you saw at Digital Life?

887
01:03:33,473 --> 01:03:38,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, the best thing at Digital Life was the DDR booth, which is where I was working all weekend.

888
01:03:39,058 --> 01:03:39,599
[SPEAKER_12]: What was there?

889
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:41,180
[SPEAKER_12]: What was at the DDR booth that made it so great?

890
01:03:42,196 --> 01:03:44,556
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tournaments going on all weekend long.

891
01:03:45,797 --> 01:03:49,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention we were the only booth that had the best giveaways.

892
01:03:50,858 --> 01:03:51,998
[SPEAKER_12]: What kind of stuff was being given?

893
01:03:52,018 --> 01:03:55,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's right, because they do like the $1,000 tournament there or something, right?

894
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Like big, big money.

895
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:04,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, it was about over $8,000 worth of prize money and prizes.

896
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of pissed I missed New York City by a week.

897
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,780
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have loved to have been there.

898
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:10,441
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honestly, it's all right because...

899
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:24,638
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I hear they're having talks about, it's not completely official yet, so you can't take my word on it, is next year, because there's no more Big E3, there's also going to be a Digital Life in LA.

900
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:26,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.

901
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:27,699
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have to check that out.

902
01:04:28,979 --> 01:04:31,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to be at Nintendo World Store Saturday at noon?

903
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm going to be there.

904
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:34,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

905
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:34,981
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

906
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:39,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to put you on the spot or anything, but if you're not there, I'm going to cry.

907
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:40,002
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm kidding.

908
01:04:40,825 --> 01:04:41,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I might have some CDs.

909
01:04:41,706 --> 01:04:43,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know you were going to be there Saturday.

910
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:44,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did you not hear the part A?

911
01:04:44,608 --> 01:04:46,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm going to be there Saturday at noon.

912
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:47,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

913
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:48,590
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

914
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.

915
01:04:49,311 --> 01:04:49,651
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

916
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:50,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we'll see you then.

917
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:53,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else you want to say for the listeners?

918
01:04:54,694 --> 01:04:55,315
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not really.

919
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:55,975
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

920
01:04:56,235 --> 01:04:57,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll go to some more calls.

921
01:04:58,017 --> 01:04:59,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Glad to hear you had a good time at Digital Life.

922
01:04:59,458 --> 01:04:59,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

923
01:05:00,658 --> 01:05:00,959
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

924
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:01,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

925
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:02,419
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

926
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:02,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

927
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

928
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:04,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Legend of Zaku

929
01:05:24,801 --> 01:05:27,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to let you in on a little radio secret here, okay?

930
01:05:27,463 --> 01:05:35,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes we pick up the calls a little bit before I'm ready to acknowledge that you're actually on the line just because it makes for a smoother transition that way.

931
01:05:35,488 --> 01:05:38,410
[SPEAKER_12]: So until we say, Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

932
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Shh, be quiet.

933
01:05:40,492 --> 01:05:40,732
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

934
01:05:41,032 --> 01:05:41,332
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

935
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:42,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Saku, what's on your mind?

936
01:05:43,574 --> 01:05:45,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, I was also there too, man.

937
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:46,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also at Digital Life.

938
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:48,377
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a feeling you'd have something to say on Digital Life.

939
01:05:49,337 --> 01:05:50,518
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, I competed.

940
01:05:50,858 --> 01:05:52,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I competed in freestyle on Saturday.

941
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:52,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And how was it?

942
01:05:53,871 --> 01:06:00,092
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm about to post right now in the chat room is a link to the actual, to my routine.

943
01:06:00,232 --> 01:06:02,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, it was a bad routine.

944
01:06:02,473 --> 01:06:02,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

945
01:06:05,954 --> 01:06:09,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you get the get it joke right there.

946
01:06:10,035 --> 01:06:11,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'm actually looking at it right now.

947
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:14,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a bad routine.

948
01:06:15,236 --> 01:06:16,336
[SPEAKER_12]: You're looking at the screen!

949
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:18,917
[SPEAKER_12]: How long did you practice this?

950
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:22,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I was totally unprepared for this.

951
01:06:22,466 --> 01:06:23,928
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an improv all the way.

952
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:29,233
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, yeah, you got some cool alarm movements there, but yeah.

953
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:32,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Saku, you're looking at the screen too much, buddy.

954
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:32,657
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

955
01:06:32,677 --> 01:06:34,458
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, but it's alright though.

956
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't care less right now because I had a good time and I have no regrets for that.

957
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:42,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see somebody left you a comment to go dance on some landmines?

958
01:06:46,698 --> 01:06:47,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the internet's mean.

959
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I also played the Wii.

960
01:06:51,601 --> 01:06:52,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what did you think of the Wii?

961
01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:55,424
[SPEAKER_02]: On Elebits, definitely.

962
01:06:55,464 --> 01:06:55,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hot.

963
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:57,425
[SPEAKER_02]: You liked Elebits?

964
01:06:58,145 --> 01:06:59,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

965
01:06:59,066 --> 01:07:03,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was fun for the fact that you could actually aim and move stuff around.

966
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't miscalibrated for you?

967
01:07:08,283 --> 01:07:13,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it was a little jerky, but I had to move a little bit back.

968
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:18,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I moved up closer, it wasn't even engaging.

969
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:23,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more further away I was from the screen, the more better the controls were.

970
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:25,352
[SPEAKER_02]: What about PS3?

971
01:07:25,592 --> 01:07:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get your little hands on the PS3?

972
01:07:27,373 --> 01:07:30,114
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the lines were pretty long for that.

973
01:07:30,555 --> 01:07:32,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to play Guitar Hero 2 as well.

974
01:07:32,335 --> 01:07:33,216
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of that?

975
01:07:34,153 --> 01:07:37,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the same thing, it just has more difficulties.

976
01:07:37,755 --> 01:07:40,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You can select characters and guitars.

977
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's another last minute story involving Guitar Hero 2 now that you brought it up.

978
01:07:44,378 --> 01:07:45,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, about the controller.

979
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:48,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, who's hosting this show?

980
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, man.

981
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:52,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry about spilling the beans, as you were.

982
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:54,484
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you might as well finish your thought.

983
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:58,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't you go, Zaku, why don't you play OLR Reporter here and tell us this story about Guitar Hero 2.

984
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: From what's being said is that the demo version is not allowing you to play third-party controllers.

985
01:08:10,423 --> 01:08:19,605
[SPEAKER_12]: So, in other words, this company that essentially made its name on making third-party controllers has locked third-party controllers out of its next game.

986
01:08:21,926 --> 01:08:24,167
[SPEAKER_12]: According to the demo, if the demo is any indication.

987
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:25,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

988
01:08:26,887 --> 01:08:28,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I've got to go, but I'll let you know

989
01:08:29,591 --> 01:08:30,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some free swag for you.

990
01:08:30,893 --> 01:08:31,313
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

991
01:08:31,553 --> 01:08:32,054
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?

992
01:08:32,314 --> 01:08:33,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you have to go so fast?

993
01:08:33,456 --> 01:08:35,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, I got some stuff to take care of.

994
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:39,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you know if any free swag helps.

995
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:40,784
[SPEAKER_02]: The cops are there.

996
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:42,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Zaku, go tell the cops we said hi.

997
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:49,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Worst call ever.

998
01:08:50,618 --> 01:08:55,380
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the part in Mr. Robinson's neighborhood that we learn about the word of the day.

999
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:58,262
[SPEAKER_11]: The word of the day is fire escape.

1000
01:08:58,642 --> 01:09:00,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids, do you know what a fire escape is?

1001
01:09:01,544 --> 01:09:02,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Cabbage patch, kid.

1002
01:09:04,665 --> 01:09:05,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1003
01:09:05,866 --> 01:09:06,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1004
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:08,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, it's Ranma.

1005
01:09:08,427 --> 01:09:09,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Ranma.

1006
01:09:09,088 --> 01:09:09,828
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1007
01:09:09,848 --> 01:09:10,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Ranma.

1008
01:09:11,709 --> 01:09:13,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Ocean.

1009
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:14,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Go figure.

1010
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,712
[SPEAKER_12]: All the New York City listeners are trying to hammer like mad to get through tonight.

1011
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:18,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me guess.

1012
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:19,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you go to Digital Life?

1013
01:09:20,345 --> 01:09:24,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did, and you did say last week you want all the New York callers to call in, so we did.

1014
01:09:24,947 --> 01:09:25,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, what's on your mind?

1015
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:26,708
[SPEAKER_12]: How was Digital Life?

1016
01:09:27,628 --> 01:09:28,408
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

1017
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:34,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday, I didn't get as much swag, but today I got there early, got plenty of good stuff, mostly t-shirts.

1018
01:09:36,432 --> 01:09:37,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you get to play PlayStation 3?

1019
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even bother.

1020
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:41,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1021
01:09:41,534 --> 01:09:48,016
[SPEAKER_05]: They had NBA Live up there, and it was like, everybody else was around there, like, drooling over NBA Live.

1022
01:09:48,076 --> 01:09:49,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, it's just a game.

1023
01:09:49,764 --> 01:09:52,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I pointed at the $600 brick, laughed and walked away.

1024
01:09:52,746 --> 01:09:53,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Played the Wii.

1025
01:09:54,247 --> 01:09:55,688
[SPEAKER_12]: You're cutting out a little bit there.

1026
01:09:55,728 --> 01:09:58,709
[SPEAKER_12]: You said you didn't play the $600 brick, but you played the Wii?

1027
01:09:59,530 --> 01:09:59,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1028
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:00,731
[SPEAKER_12]: How was the Wii?

1029
01:10:02,252 --> 01:10:04,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little bit new to me.

1030
01:10:04,373 --> 01:10:05,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Played Elebit.

1031
01:10:05,233 --> 01:10:05,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

1032
01:10:06,194 --> 01:10:07,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Was Elebit the only game they had there or something?

1033
01:10:09,056 --> 01:10:12,758
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they also had Madden for the Wii, but EA shut that down for some odd reason.

1034
01:10:13,258 --> 01:10:13,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

1035
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:15,179
[SPEAKER_12]: So, what did you think of Elebit?

1036
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

1037
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:17,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was...

1038
01:10:18,365 --> 01:10:19,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even want to get off the machine.

1039
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:24,289
[SPEAKER_12]: I walked over there, but it was so crowded, so I just watched.

1040
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:27,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hung out with Zaku and Sephiroth for a bit.

1041
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:28,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hell yeah, dude.

1042
01:10:28,652 --> 01:10:31,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, get in touch with me Friday night for dinner.

1043
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:35,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll email you with the real itinerary a little later.

1044
01:10:47,992 --> 01:10:48,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1045
01:10:48,392 --> 01:10:53,014
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only thing I'm publicly saying I'm doing is the Saturday noon thing, but I'll tell you a little more about what I'm doing later.

1046
01:10:53,275 --> 01:10:54,195
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1047
01:10:54,335 --> 01:10:55,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anything else you want to share about Digital Life?

1048
01:10:57,237 --> 01:10:58,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, it was fun.

1049
01:10:58,477 --> 01:11:05,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I remember talking before about how it's going to be the next E3, but it's more of a tech expo than anything else.

1050
01:11:07,121 --> 01:11:13,164
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're saying because of the fact it's a little bit too broad in its tech specs that it may not have the power to be the next E3?

1051
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:16,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see it happening anytime soon, literally, I don't.

1052
01:11:17,085 --> 01:11:18,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, we'll see.

1053
01:11:18,386 --> 01:11:18,726
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1054
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:20,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially if there's a Digital Life LA, we'll see.

1055
01:11:21,288 --> 01:11:22,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Ranma, thanks for the call.

1056
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:24,871
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you on Saturday.

1057
01:11:24,971 --> 01:11:26,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe Friday, if you're lucky.

1058
01:11:26,152 --> 01:11:26,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1059
01:11:28,133 --> 01:11:28,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

1060
01:11:30,214 --> 01:11:32,196
[SPEAKER_12]: That was Ranma here, another New York City listener.

1061
01:11:32,216 --> 01:11:33,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1062
01:11:33,697 --> 01:11:34,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1063
01:11:34,598 --> 01:11:35,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Gravings Dolphin.

1064
01:11:35,778 --> 01:11:36,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, buddy.

1065
01:11:36,299 --> 01:11:36,939
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1066
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,902
[SPEAKER_12]: You made me force me to get a Wii order.

1067
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:41,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, hold on.

1068
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:43,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Sit tight for a minute there.

1069
01:11:43,244 --> 01:11:43,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

1070
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:45,997
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1071
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:10,231
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you've been talking about, you've got to get a Wii.

1072
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:10,852
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get a Wii.

1073
01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:12,133
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get a Wii.

1074
01:12:12,253 --> 01:12:13,374
[SPEAKER_03]: When did I say you've got to get a Wii?

1075
01:12:13,394 --> 01:12:14,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get a Wii.

1076
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:16,657
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what is going through my mind.

1077
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:18,018
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, Wii, like 200?

1078
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:21,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because I want a Wii really badly.

1079
01:12:23,003 --> 01:12:23,544
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's me.

1080
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:27,387
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, as I said earlier, I referenced what I told that email bag thing earlier.

1081
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,529
[SPEAKER_12]: You really have to make decisions based on what's best for you.

1082
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:31,131
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's best for me right now?

1083
01:12:34,053 --> 01:12:36,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured your logic too.

1084
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:37,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going Wii 60 all the way.

1085
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:41,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so how was your experience pre-ordering?

1086
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Where did you go?

1087
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:42,881
[SPEAKER_12]: How was it?

1088
01:12:43,752 --> 01:12:45,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it wasn't that bad.

1089
01:12:45,953 --> 01:12:48,554
[SPEAKER_03]: The mall I didn't go to was jammed.

1090
01:12:48,694 --> 01:12:51,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, God, I'm glad I didn't go there.

1091
01:12:51,315 --> 01:12:53,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one in Atlantic City was nice.

1092
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I stood in line for an hour and 40 minutes.

1093
01:12:56,557 --> 01:12:59,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like this woman, her car broke down.

1094
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:01,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to hear that.

1095
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But her kid wanted the Wii so bad.

1096
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:06,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It was eight people, and they were all nice.

1097
01:13:08,823 --> 01:13:12,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, it was eight people that all came together, or it was eight people in the line?

1098
01:13:12,774 --> 01:13:13,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight people in line.

1099
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:15,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that doesn't seem... Whereabouts are you from?

1100
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:17,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Atlantic City.

1101
01:13:17,798 --> 01:13:21,121
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't seem very long, all things considered, for a town like Atlantic City.

1102
01:13:21,341 --> 01:13:22,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Only eight people in the line.

1103
01:13:22,842 --> 01:13:23,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh.

1104
01:13:23,423 --> 01:13:23,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay.

1105
01:13:24,604 --> 01:13:26,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a small town.

1106
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:27,926
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing we do is gamble.

1107
01:13:28,226 --> 01:13:28,847
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's true.

1108
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:29,307
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

1109
01:13:30,068 --> 01:13:32,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but I bet the Vegas GameStop lines were long.

1110
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:33,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.

1111
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:41,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, one of the best places to go for cheap electronics is pawn shops in gambling towns.

1112
01:13:42,253 --> 01:13:44,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So go to your local pawn shop, find a Wii.

1113
01:13:44,634 --> 01:13:45,974
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good suggestion.

1114
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:49,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so what did you pre-order with your Wii?

1115
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:51,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you just get the Wii or did you get any games?

1116
01:13:52,056 --> 01:13:54,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got the Wii because I know I have to have it.

1117
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:59,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio episode, I can't remember, for the 19th.

1118
01:13:59,818 --> 01:14:02,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, yeah, I don't know what number it is either, but it's going to be an interesting show.

1119
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Our buddy DMN is actually going to be here in-house.

1120
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:09,081
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to have our Nintendo QA guy actually here in-house, so it'll be fun.

1121
01:14:10,268 --> 01:14:11,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one more.

1122
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:16,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually went to a McDonald's for a way port, and it works pretty good.

1123
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:18,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's cool.

1124
01:14:19,396 --> 01:14:20,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got a vision camera.

1125
01:14:20,898 --> 01:14:22,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can have a Rob Astey.

1126
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,240
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1127
01:14:24,421 --> 01:14:25,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Not happening.

1128
01:14:26,142 --> 01:14:27,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Not without proper compensation.

1129
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:30,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, freak, I'm hanging up on you now.

1130
01:14:31,487 --> 01:14:31,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

1131
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,149
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up with that?

1132
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,591
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so weird.

1133
01:14:37,216 --> 01:14:38,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, who'd want to see that?

1134
01:14:39,196 --> 01:14:41,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Who'd want to see my ass on Xbox Live?

1135
01:14:41,117 --> 01:14:41,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That's disgusting.

1136
01:14:42,297 --> 01:14:44,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Rob, you know everyone wants to see your ass.

1137
01:14:44,237 --> 01:14:46,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Not until I work it out a little bit, sorry.

1138
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:47,478
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they want to see your wee.

1139
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:49,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they ain't going to get that.

1140
01:14:49,558 --> 01:14:50,078
[SPEAKER_12]: One more call.

1141
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:51,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1142
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:52,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1143
01:14:53,059 --> 01:14:53,939
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Dark Teeth.

1144
01:14:54,339 --> 01:14:55,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, what's on your mind, Dark Teeth?

1145
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:56,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Dark Teeth?

1146
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:58,680
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Dark Tetsuya.

1147
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Dark Tea, short for Dark Tetsuya.

1148
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,140
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1149
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up and let the man talk.

1150
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,761
[SPEAKER_06]: We have iced tea.

1151
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:06,041
[SPEAKER_12]: He's one of our hardworking staffers.

1152
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:06,501
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1153
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:10,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a few FUs.

1154
01:15:11,146 --> 01:15:12,126
[SPEAKER_07]: You have FUs?

1155
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:16,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Well... Are they gaming related?

1156
01:15:17,248 --> 01:15:17,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1157
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:18,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, then we'll take them.

1158
01:15:18,728 --> 01:15:19,068
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up?

1159
01:15:21,009 --> 01:15:28,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you heard about Konami's link issue thing on Supernova?

1160
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:32,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I guess they officially declared that link mode ain't happening this week.

1161
01:15:32,913 --> 01:15:36,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this week the official press announcement went out or whatever you want to call it.

1162
01:15:36,474 --> 01:15:37,594
[SPEAKER_12]: At least DDR Freak ran it.

1163
01:15:38,739 --> 01:15:40,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Link Mode is not happening in Supernova.

1164
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:41,181
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes you mad?

1165
01:15:42,563 --> 01:15:43,163
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit.

1166
01:15:43,704 --> 01:15:52,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you looking forward to making custom dance steps to songs such as... I don't even know what the hell songs are in Supernova.

1167
01:15:52,612 --> 01:15:53,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Fascination Max.

1168
01:15:54,995 --> 01:15:55,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I had it planned.

1169
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:57,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other FUs?

1170
01:15:57,917 --> 01:15:58,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming related?

1171
01:16:00,245 --> 01:16:04,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just that my local arcade hasn't got Supernova yet.

1172
01:16:04,688 --> 01:16:07,990
[SPEAKER_12]: What is up with lack of Supernova machines in Sacramento?

1173
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,191
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1174
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:10,992
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess we're just not a real town.

1175
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:12,873
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just some cow town in the middle of nowhere.

1176
01:16:13,534 --> 01:16:15,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, someday, Dark Tetsuya, someday.

1177
01:16:15,955 --> 01:16:19,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, did you do any of the Wii pre-ordering or PlayStation 3?

1178
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:20,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no.

1179
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:21,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

1180
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to be getting any of them?

1181
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably get a Wii for Christmas.

1182
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:25,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1183
01:16:25,802 --> 01:16:28,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're hoping Santa will bring you one.

1184
01:16:30,164 --> 01:16:31,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you been good this year?

1185
01:16:32,445 --> 01:16:32,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1186
01:16:32,905 --> 01:16:35,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, then maybe Santa will bring you one, so that'll be cool.

1187
01:16:35,826 --> 01:16:36,166
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1188
01:16:36,746 --> 01:16:37,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Or he'll give you a spanking.

1189
01:16:38,686 --> 01:16:39,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Or some coal.

1190
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:43,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if you've been bad, though, you'll get a six-axis, and that's all you get.

1191
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:46,588
[SPEAKER_12]: You just get the paperweight of a six-axis.

1192
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:48,609
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys aren't on the afterbirth, right?

1193
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,522
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're on the actual podcast show.

1194
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:52,306
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never been on the podcast before.

1195
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:53,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

1196
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:57,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Extrofer is one of our other personalities on Orange Lounge Radio.

1197
01:16:57,137 --> 01:16:58,440
[SPEAKER_12]: He does the Wednesday night show with me.

1198
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,522
[SPEAKER_12]: And what else would they know you from?

1199
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, other than that, I really like Supernova.

1200
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:29,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah?

1201
01:17:29,655 --> 01:17:31,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you like the home release of Supernova?

1202
01:17:32,116 --> 01:17:32,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1203
01:17:32,756 --> 01:17:33,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Top three songs, quick.

1204
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:36,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1205
01:17:36,577 --> 01:17:42,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Centerfold, Battle Without Honor, Humanity, and Gumland a Couple.

1206
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:43,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

1207
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course you'd say that.

1208
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Guacamole Del Taco, right?

1209
01:17:47,321 --> 01:17:47,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

1210
01:17:47,781 --> 01:17:48,061
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1211
01:17:48,161 --> 01:17:49,062
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, Dark Tetsuya.

1212
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:49,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks so much for the call.

1213
01:17:49,942 --> 01:17:50,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, all right?

1214
01:17:51,462 --> 01:17:51,822
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

1215
01:17:51,942 --> 01:17:52,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

1216
01:17:53,223 --> 01:17:55,604
[SPEAKER_12]: One of our hardworking staff members there, that Dark Tetsuya.

1217
01:17:55,724 --> 01:17:56,564
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate him.

1218
01:17:57,831 --> 01:17:59,972
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight.

1219
01:18:00,212 --> 01:18:01,693
[SPEAKER_12]: If you didn't get through, so sorry.

1220
01:18:02,213 --> 01:18:03,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Try again next week.

1221
01:18:03,074 --> 01:18:04,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other last-minute stories?

1222
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:05,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1223
01:18:06,736 --> 01:18:07,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

1224
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:13,079
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked earlier about video game movies and there being a movie called 8-Bit the Movie.

1225
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, there is another movie coming out.

1226
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:19,543
[SPEAKER_11]: For your PSP, you can download the entire movie.

1227
01:18:19,603 --> 01:18:25,286
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Killing Time 24-7, and it is available online, actually.

1228
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:28,883
[SPEAKER_11]: for full download to your PSP, which I think is kind of cool.

1229
01:18:28,943 --> 01:18:32,065
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like a Hitman movie, basically.

1230
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:44,733
[SPEAKER_11]: The main character who kills people and in his spare time hangs out with his friends and goes to arcades and whatnot and stuff gets a new assignment and his new hit is his father.

1231
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:48,096
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's kind of based on that.

1232
01:18:48,296 --> 01:18:49,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually pretty cool.

1233
01:18:49,116 --> 01:18:54,880
[SPEAKER_11]: The download itself is about 300 or just over 300 megs and you can actually find it

1234
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:58,162
[SPEAKER_11]: To download, and I'm pulling up the website.

1235
01:18:58,242 --> 01:19:02,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, right now... Thrilling Radio.

1236
01:19:03,404 --> 01:19:03,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1237
01:19:04,665 --> 01:19:08,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but anyways... Let's see.

1238
01:19:08,726 --> 01:19:18,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's KillingTime- Yeah, it's KillingTime-24-7.com If you want to download it.

1239
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:19,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Free download for your PSP.

1240
01:19:20,712 --> 01:19:20,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1241
01:19:22,032 --> 01:19:22,432
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

1242
01:19:22,793 --> 01:19:23,353
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I had.

1243
01:19:23,413 --> 01:19:23,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow!

1244
01:19:24,454 --> 01:19:25,955
[SPEAKER_11]: That was good, that was one sentence.

1245
01:19:49,008 --> 01:19:51,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony Hawk's Project 8 gets some pretty awesome multiplayer on the 360.

1246
01:19:52,672 --> 01:19:55,214
[SPEAKER_11]: PlayStation 3 does not have any multiplayer whatsoever.

1247
01:19:55,414 --> 01:19:56,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was two sentences, but that's all right.

1248
01:19:57,316 --> 01:19:57,696
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good.

1249
01:19:57,777 --> 01:19:58,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Semicolon.

1250
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:58,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there?

1251
01:19:58,737 --> 01:20:01,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1252
01:20:02,021 --> 01:20:05,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft launched a new website to browse Xbox Live Marketplace.

1253
01:20:06,545 --> 01:20:07,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, I actually saw that.

1254
01:20:08,547 --> 01:20:09,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was pretty cool.

1255
01:20:10,364 --> 01:20:11,666
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought, so you made it two sentences?

1256
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:14,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I was, I was dealt the story.

1257
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:14,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

1258
01:20:15,028 --> 01:20:15,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways.

1259
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:17,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And the website is Xbox Pipeline or whatever that's called?

1260
01:20:18,031 --> 01:20:19,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox Live Pipeline, something like that?

1261
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:20,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Something like that.

1262
01:20:20,473 --> 01:20:20,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways.

1263
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:22,574
[SPEAKER_12]: We're so informative.

1264
01:20:24,076 --> 01:20:25,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there's some website.

1265
01:20:25,036 --> 01:20:26,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't tell you what the name of it is.

1266
01:20:26,037 --> 01:20:26,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, okay, here, okay.

1267
01:20:27,178 --> 01:20:30,160
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you the exact website because I am awesome like that.

1268
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:36,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, the actual website is XboxLivePipeline.com, so go check it out if you haven't already.

1269
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:38,167
[SPEAKER_11]: It has the look and feel of an Xbox.

1270
01:20:38,227 --> 01:20:38,587
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of nice.

1271
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:39,288
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty cool.

1272
01:20:40,706 --> 01:20:41,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some news.

1273
01:20:42,907 --> 01:20:43,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1274
01:20:44,367 --> 01:20:46,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki is officially very funny.

1275
01:20:47,148 --> 01:20:50,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Last night we went and ate out at a buffet place.

1276
01:20:51,589 --> 01:20:51,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1277
01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:53,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, this doesn't have to do with games.

1278
01:20:54,389 --> 01:20:57,270
[SPEAKER_13]: We killed people on the way because we were racing there.

1279
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that good enough?

1280
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:06,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, Loki asks the waitress or whoever she was serving us or whatever.

1281
01:21:06,552 --> 01:21:10,193
[SPEAKER_13]: He asks her if they're serving any popcorn shrimp.

1282
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:15,780
[SPEAKER_13]: and she goes, and he looks at her and he goes, okay.

1283
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody's like, did you understand what she just said?

1284
01:21:19,882 --> 01:21:21,964
[SPEAKER_13]: And Loki's just very calm.

1285
01:21:22,504 --> 01:21:23,385
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't understand anything.

1286
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, it was just so funny.

1287
01:21:26,968 --> 01:21:28,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Give it up for Extra Furnace.

1288
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:30,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Farewell performance here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1289
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:30,790
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1290
01:21:31,691 --> 01:21:37,355
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I did want to mention, I read this week on the PlayStation 3 online web browser they were talking about,

1291
01:21:38,465 --> 01:21:40,526
[SPEAKER_11]: that it has is for text entry.

1292
01:21:41,127 --> 01:21:46,911
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't have a controller or whatever, it has that crappy text entry that they have on the PSP.

1293
01:21:47,892 --> 01:21:48,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that stupid?

1294
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:50,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to mention that.

1295
01:21:52,496 --> 01:21:54,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other fun stuff I was going to say.

1296
01:21:54,137 --> 01:22:04,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember, well, Japan's getting a brand new Wii Classic controller plus 5,000 point bundle, which is nice because we'll never see that here.

1297
01:22:05,924 --> 01:22:09,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that was all I had.

1298
01:22:09,326 --> 01:22:17,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, PlayStation 3 Oblivion was supposed to be getting exclusive content for it, but it actually is going to be available for us as well.

1299
01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:19,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So, on the Xbox 360 and PC.

1300
01:22:20,594 --> 01:22:20,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh well.

1301
01:22:23,016 --> 01:22:24,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, a new Prey content for online.

1302
01:22:24,777 --> 01:22:25,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Multiplayer maps and stuff.

1303
01:22:26,098 --> 01:22:27,059
[SPEAKER_12]: I really haven't played much Prey.

1304
01:22:28,413 --> 01:22:30,094
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:09,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yes, I forgot The Grudge 2 opened up this weekend.

1316
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:10,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wants to go see it with me?

1317
01:24:11,244 --> 01:24:12,645

01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:24,631
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I totally won't.

1322
01:24:24,671 --> 01:24:27,693
[SPEAKER_12]: You should see the way he did that, he kind of did this whole little thing.

1323
01:24:27,733 --> 01:24:28,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no.

1324
01:24:29,954 --> 01:24:32,296
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not you, DarkSakura, it's the movie.

1325
01:24:32,996 --> 01:24:33,877
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, no, I will see it.

1326
01:24:33,937 --> 01:24:35,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to see Sarah Michelle Gellar die.

1327
01:24:35,898 --> 01:24:36,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I do too.

1328
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:37,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, spoilers.

1329
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:41,041
[SPEAKER_13]: No, she doesn't die soon.

1330
01:24:42,242 --> 01:24:45,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw a really good movie this last weekend though called The Departed.

1331
01:24:45,824 --> 01:24:46,464
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see that.

1332
01:24:46,724 --> 01:24:47,525
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so great.

1333
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:49,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, great, great.

1334
01:24:49,653 --> 01:24:50,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess what?

1335
01:24:50,373 --> 01:24:50,554
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1336
01:24:51,214 --> 01:24:51,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob.

1337
01:24:51,995 --> 01:24:52,175
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1338
01:24:52,516 --> 01:24:52,696
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1339
01:24:53,036 --> 01:24:53,337
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1340
01:24:53,477 --> 01:24:53,977
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1341
01:24:55,940 --> 01:25:02,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, see the problem is folks who didn't listen to the three hour show when the grudge came out don't understand why you make that weird ass noise.

1342
01:25:03,448 --> 01:25:04,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you making that weird ass noise?

1343
01:25:04,749 --> 01:25:07,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the episode when I did that almost the entire thing.

1344
01:25:07,553 --> 01:25:09,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Two quick, quick things that came out.

1345
01:25:10,134 --> 01:25:15,681
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing that's being reported in our chat, like literally right this second, Bubble Bobble for the DS is broken.

1346
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:17,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Players cannot pass level 30.

1347
01:25:17,103 --> 01:25:19,545
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been confirmed by Codemasters.

1348
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Way to go, Codemasters QA.

1349
01:25:21,808 --> 01:25:22,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your thing real quick.

1350
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was just making fun of this thing.

1351
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:28,276
[SPEAKER_11]: They ran a report on Gizmodo about...

1352
01:25:29,318 --> 01:25:30,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Stuff that you can buy that looks stupid.

1353
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,422
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a Mame Cabinet costume for Halloween.

1354
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:41,387
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought it was funny because the joystick, which is abnormally large, is placed right next to where his penis would be.

1355
01:25:41,908 --> 01:25:45,651
[SPEAKER_11]: And the coin door, which has two slots right where his balls would be.

1356
01:25:46,051 --> 01:25:48,773
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just the college humor in me.

1357
01:25:49,253 --> 01:25:49,954
[SPEAKER_12]: That's lovely.

1358
01:25:50,683 --> 01:25:55,107
[SPEAKER_12]: And on that note, we're going to call it a night for Orange Lounge Radio this week.

1359
01:25:55,587 --> 01:25:58,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, we will not be live on Sunday next week.

1360
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,952
[SPEAKER_12]: We're pre-taped because both DarkSakura and I are traveling.

1361
01:26:02,173 --> 01:26:03,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, YowieCon.

1362
01:26:04,775 --> 01:26:06,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Or New York City, Nintendo World Store.

1363
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:09,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Nightmare Before Christmas at the Metreon on Friday night.

1364
01:26:12,562 --> 01:26:13,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I do it a lot better than you do.

1365
01:26:14,464 --> 01:26:15,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just unplug that microphone?

1366
01:26:16,145 --> 01:26:16,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there we go.

1367
01:26:16,886 --> 01:26:17,566
[SPEAKER_12]: See, now it's unplugged.

1368
01:26:20,646 --> 01:26:24,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for supporting independent internet radio even when it's crappy like tonight.

1369
01:26:24,589 --> 01:26:24,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Good night.

1370
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:30,533
