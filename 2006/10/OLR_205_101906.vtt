00:00.000 --> 00:21.480
Tonight, October 22nd, 2006, new firmware is on deck to the PSP, a Nintendo DS game

00:21.480 --> 00:29.760
releases with a major bug still in the game, and is EA watching your every move?

00:29.760 --> 00:36.760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that

00:36.760 --> 00:41.840
video game podcast dedicated to gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, and what you, the

00:41.840 --> 00:47.280
gamer, really want to know. Welcome to our show. We're pre-taping this week. We're a

00:47.280 --> 00:51.760
little early. It is Wednesday night, October 18th, but this will be our week

00:51.760 --> 00:56.600
show. That's because I'm traveling this week, and so is one of our lovely co-hosts

00:56.600 --> 01:01.440
here, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Are you saying that Loki is lovely? I suppose. In

01:01.440 --> 01:06.040
his own manly way. And I'm moving. Yeah, that's right, you're moving this weekend.

01:06.040 --> 01:10.140
So everybody's busy this weekend, so it's just a bad weekend for us. I'm going to see

01:10.140 --> 01:17.320
see, uh, boy love. Oh, YowieCon? Going to YowieCon, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.600
And? Gonna see Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D! But see, by the time most people

01:21.600 --> 01:24.640
hear this, that will have all already happened, because this this is still

01:24.640 --> 01:26.720
going to air usually on Sundays.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.040
We do have a small audience in our chat, a lot of our loyal listeners tonight here on

01:30.040 --> 01:31.040
Wednesday night.

01:31.040 --> 01:35.440
I just wanted to kind of lay that down up front just in case there was some developing

01:35.440 --> 01:38.260
news, some of these stories changed throughout the week.

01:38.260 --> 01:43.000
Keep your time frame in mind that we're doing this on Wednesday, so don't blame us if something

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
changed.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.240
Don't blame us collectively, but you can blame Rob personally.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.240
Sure, why not?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.880
All right, so anyway, let's start it off.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.360
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

01:51.360 --> 01:54.040
I had a gaming week.

01:54.040 --> 01:58.080
My gaming week consisted of me being half asleep watching Dan play that crappy Mortal

01:58.080 --> 02:03.640
Kombat game, going, oh my God, I hate the sound effects of this game, go to sleep.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.200
That's what we talked about last week.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.760
I know, but that wasn't, since my gaming week has been three days.

02:08.760 --> 02:14.040
No, no, I know, but I'm curious, I thought it was okay, why did you think it was crappy?

02:14.040 --> 02:16.720
I hate the music in it and I hate the sound effects.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.720
And just watching him do the same crap over and over.

02:19.720 --> 02:35.760
If I want to play a good beat-em-up, I could do that Tekken fighting mode from Tekken 3.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.680
I actually haven't played Phantasy Star Universe yet, either, because I've been doing real

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
life things.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
Well, you're in luck.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.520
I heard the beta was extended, which, again, we'll do the Sunday listeners no good because

02:46.520 --> 02:49.800
it's extended through Saturday, but that's what I'm hearing.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.800
It doesn't mean no good.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.800
Well, unless I want to play tonight.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.800
I think you can play some tonight.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
Yeah.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.840
I'm actually gaming gaming tomorrow.

02:56.840 --> 02:57.840
Like old-school D&D.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.840
Like, no.

02:58.840 --> 02:59.840
Roll D20.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.840
Werewolf.

03:00.840 --> 03:01.840
Oh, God, you nerd.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.840
I game every other week.

03:02.840 --> 03:09.800
Yes, everybody, not only am I a video gaming girl, I do tabletop gaming, too.

03:09.800 --> 03:14.080
Which just, you know, further cement you as a hardcore nerd.

03:14.080 --> 03:19.080
I know what a D4 is used for in second edition D&D, bitches.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.080
Nerd patrol.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.080
Nerd patrol.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.080
You can use it for a whip.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.080
Nerd herd.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.080
Nerd herd.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
Loki, how you doing?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
How was your gaming week?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.080
It was short, I guess.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.640
Well, I played Grand Theft Auto.

03:31.640 --> 03:36.600
I didn't get to play any of the PlayStation 2 games that I have lined up to play.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.120
I don't get to play a lot of games right now because I'm packing, and packing sucks.

03:41.120 --> 03:46.280
But I am looking forward to playing The Warriors, which, you know, is coming out on the PSV

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
pretty soon.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.800
Well, probably next year.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.800
Yes, it was a movie, and it was an awesome PlayStation 2 game, too.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.240
So yeah, lots of Grand Theft Auto, and I'm kicking ass in that.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.200
And Zuma a little bit.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.360
I'm on level 9 now.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.240
I beat level 8 while Nellie was asleep because she couldn't get past it, and she was getting

04:06.240 --> 04:07.240
frustrated.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.640
But she says, you know, she has to beat it herself before or else it doesn't count.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.640
I don't know.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.800
So whatever.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.040
And then I played a little Dig Dug, and I was trying to play some Luminous Live, but

04:18.040 --> 04:21.640
it won't download for me because it stops at 1%.

04:21.640 --> 04:26.400
Xbox has been having some wacky stuff today ever since their maintenance yesterday.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.160
And what did their maintenance do?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.000
It's just stuff for their website, from what I hear.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.140
Well, we don't really know the full scope of things yet, so possibly they've done some

04:34.140 --> 04:36.080
type of upgrade that's dormant until later.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.620
They broke Luminous Live.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.960
That's what their update was for.

04:39.960 --> 04:40.960
I don't know.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.480
Oh, and of course Saints Row.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.080
Been playing lots of Saints Row, and that's fun.

04:46.080 --> 04:51.960
I'm trying for the million dollar achievement right now, and once I get that then I'll kind

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
of move on.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.360
Yeah, that's pretty much it for now.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.520
Some comments from our chat room.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.680
We do have a small crowd there tonight, a little smaller than our usual Sunday show,

05:01.680 --> 05:05.440
but we say thank you to the loyalists who are there as always.

05:05.440 --> 05:10.640
Jeremy Todd 1 in response to Dark Soccer being a hardcore nerd says, Tabletop gaming is for

05:10.640 --> 05:13.960
people who aren't hardcore enough to play video games.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
I did both.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.520
That means I'm double hardcore.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.880
SSJ100 Matt says, Jesus saves and rolls D20s.

05:21.880 --> 05:22.880
Get it?

05:22.880 --> 05:23.880
That's a roleplaying joke.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.080
Did Jesus make a saving throw?

05:26.080 --> 05:27.720
Let's see, My Gaming Week.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.860
I've been playing more of the Phantasy Star universe beta.

05:29.860 --> 05:34.080
I will say this, those of you guys that got frustrated with connection issues and things

05:34.080 --> 05:38.080
of that sort and getting started, may not have given the game enough opportunity because

05:38.080 --> 05:41.920
I'll tell you what, when I got in a party with some of my real life friends and we were

05:41.920 --> 05:46.040
able to do voice chat, the game got like 5,000 times better.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.040
I'm looking forward to the commercial release.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.760
I'm definitely going to pick up the commercial release.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.240
I'm still going to hold off on a full review of the game until I actually have a commercial

05:53.240 --> 05:58.400
release in my hands to review, but we will talk more about Phantasy Star universe at

05:58.400 --> 05:59.960
a later date.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.560
Meanwhile, I downloaded Luminous Life today.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.280
I was able to grab it this morning, I guess maybe before the masses were getting home

06:06.280 --> 06:12.240
from work, school, and started downloading on Luminous Life, so I picked that up.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.840
I want to warn you about something with Luminous Life.

06:14.840 --> 06:19.200
The game's got microtransactions at the butt, and when I say that, I mean when you download

06:19.200 --> 06:26.120
the game, you can play Xbox Live, you can play normal challenge mode with about, I want

06:26.120 --> 06:30.640
to say it's about 12 skins, forgive me if I'm a little off on that number, but if you

06:30.640 --> 06:34.120
want to buy more skins, like you want to get a pack of 20 skins, you're going to have to

06:34.120 --> 06:37.280
buy those later in what's called an advanced pack.

06:37.280 --> 06:42.680
Also, if you go in to play versus CPU, you only get one skin, and once you play that

06:42.680 --> 06:48.760
for about 10 levels, it says, thanks for trying this, buy the versus CPU pack if you want

06:48.760 --> 06:49.920
more.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.480
Then in mission mode, you get about five missions, hey, if you want more missions, buy the mission

06:53.480 --> 06:54.480
pack.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
Yeah, what the hell's the demo?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.480
I mean, seriously, if this is the actual game, then what's the demo?

06:57.480 --> 07:00.520
I guess it's one stage of the game, so pretty much the game you're getting on Xbox Live

07:00.520 --> 07:07.320
is just the skeleton game of the non-stop puzzle mode with about 12 different skins,

07:07.320 --> 07:09.200
and the ability to play on Xbox Live.

07:09.200 --> 07:16.880
Oh goody, but I guess they'll have 700 songs on Xbox Live at some point for a micro-transaction

07:16.880 --> 07:27.080
of $100 each, then maybe I'll get the, I can have this go with my Gran Turismo HD.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.000
It's hard for me to sit here and be critical of Gran Turismo HD for the micro-transaction

07:32.000 --> 07:35.360
things they've been talking about, and not apply the same logic to Luminous.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.180
I don't think that would be okay for me to do.

07:37.180 --> 07:41.620
As much as I love Luminous, and I think it's an awesome puzzle game, I don't think it's

07:41.620 --> 07:44.880
fair for folks to be picking up Luminous when they don't really know what they're really

07:44.880 --> 07:45.880
buying.

07:45.880 --> 07:49.640
I don't think Q Entertainment and Microsoft have been very upfront about what exactly

07:49.640 --> 07:53.840
you're getting with this, and the fact that some components of the game are missing.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.440
Are you getting a full game?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.440
Yes.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.200
Are you getting the same thing as you got on the PSP?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
No.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.280
The PSP version as it stands right now offers more than the basic skeleton that Xbox Live

08:03.280 --> 08:05.560
is giving you.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.760
I don't feel like I can give this game a fair assessment until I know it's real price for

08:08.760 --> 08:09.760
everything else.

08:09.760 --> 08:14.280
Would it have been a little bit different if the game were like $5 instead of $15 out

08:14.280 --> 08:15.280
the gate?

08:15.280 --> 08:19.920
Maybe, but again, I would take all that into consideration with how much is each little

08:19.920 --> 08:21.080
component price.

08:21.080 --> 08:25.920
For example, Test Drive Unlimited was kind of using that formula, basically putting out

08:25.920 --> 08:31.080
a very cheap game and then having microtransactions, but the difference between Test Drive Unlimited

08:31.080 --> 08:35.960
and say Gran Turismo HD or Luminous is you don't need to purchase those.

08:35.960 --> 08:41.400
Granted, I bought this game because, well, I'm a cheapen point horror and it sounded

08:41.400 --> 08:44.480
pretty easy, so hey, what the hell?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.440
So what if I play a few stages?

08:46.440 --> 08:49.400
I don't like the fact that there is only five stages because I think there should be at

08:49.400 --> 08:55.400
least more, and then say later on you want to buy more songs on top of a full game's

08:55.400 --> 08:57.040
worth of songs.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.040
That's fine.

08:58.040 --> 09:05.000
Oh, by the way, you want to progress later on, you're going to have to buy the levels.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.200
I can understand the logic that, hey, maybe not everyone wants to play Mission Mode.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.200
Hey, maybe not everyone wants to play Puzzle Mode.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.840
Okay, but still you have to take the value of what you're paying out in consideration

09:17.840 --> 09:23.600
with all this is that for right now, for a pretty competitive $29.99, you can get the

09:23.600 --> 09:27.440
PSP version of Luminous, which offers more skins.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.120
As it stands right now, better songs, as far as I'm concerned, even though, yes, some of

09:31.120 --> 09:36.440
the songs in Xbox Live's version are from Luminous 1, some of the best songs on Luminous

09:36.440 --> 09:42.640
1 are nowhere to be seen so far in Xbox Live Luminous, and when you put those values side

09:42.640 --> 09:45.280
by side, how worth it is it to be playing Luminous on your TV?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
I don't know.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.400
Or if you have a PlayStation 2.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.400
Or on Xbox Live.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.240
If you have a PlayStation 2, just wait and pick up Luminous Plus for $30 when that comes

09:52.240 --> 09:55.360
out, which is basically just a rehash of Luminous.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.760
By the way, the Madonna song, any licenses whatsoever, nowhere to be seen yet.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.320
I don't know if they're going to be in the Advance pack.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.800
Rumor has it they're not.

10:02.800 --> 10:09.480
I have someone who's had a peek at the Advance pack and tells me that there's just more general

10:09.480 --> 10:13.880
Q Entertainment produced songs in there from the first and probably second games.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.840
Nice bait and switch there, Q Entertainment.

10:15.840 --> 10:20.320
So I don't know where Madonna is or any licensed artists for that matter.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.320
That could change.

10:21.320 --> 10:26.640
I'm assuming that's on Rumor there, but I'm assuming that will be another buy later on

10:26.640 --> 10:29.680
if you want to have Madonna or what have you in your game.

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
So, interesting.

10:30.680 --> 10:36.240
Yeah, well, I remember reading, I know, and I've got to pull this up because I pulled

10:36.240 --> 10:40.520
up a different article, same type of thing, but they were talking about other additional

10:40.520 --> 10:47.400
downloads beyond the Advance pack, and I want to say it was run on 1UP, but I can't remember

10:47.400 --> 10:51.320
what they were showing, oh, here we go.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.120
I know they had a ton of micropayment stuff, and of course they were talking about the

10:54.120 --> 11:00.600
Advance pack, but they were talking about other things that you can download as well.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.160
Let's see here, it says, oh, they were just talking about, I guess, the mission and puzzle

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
mode.

11:05.160 --> 11:10.240
They're assuming that each one's going to be about the same price, so like $6 each or

11:10.240 --> 11:16.640
whatever, or 600 points each for another 12, 100 points, or $15.

11:16.640 --> 11:21.440
It says that adds up to about $22.49, and it says all of a sudden the game, after you

11:21.440 --> 11:26.840
bought everything, ends up costing you $37.49.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.840
So I don't know.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.720
I have a hard time being able to say I recommend Luminous Live or I don't because I feel like

11:31.720 --> 11:36.280
the whole game has not yet been revealed, so it really depends.

11:36.280 --> 11:42.200
Ask yourself this question before you buy it, A, if you don't own a PSP, I do think

11:42.200 --> 11:43.200
it's worth it.

11:43.200 --> 11:48.160
I don't think it's one of the greatest puzzlers ever made, even if the music is not as good

11:48.160 --> 11:49.160
as the PSP version.

11:49.160 --> 11:53.960
I wouldn't go tell you to buy a PSP just for Luminous, so I would say it's worth checking

11:53.960 --> 12:01.120
out if you don't have a PSP, but if you do have a PSP, yeah, so.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.680
Anyway, let's get into some housekeeping real quick for tonight.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.120
Tonight's housekeeping, first off, it's only going to be a one-part show tonight because

12:09.120 --> 12:12.840
of the fact that we are pre-taping and usually those only end up being one part.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.400
I do want to point out we will still be doing DDR previews tonight, even though it is only

12:16.400 --> 12:22.080
one part, and remember we're not live, so if you've joined our chat room on this lovely

12:22.080 --> 12:26.000
Sunday evening or whenever you used to listen to us live, keep in mind that we are pre-taped

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
this week.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.480
I also do have a message from one of our lesbians, Kristen would like everyone to know, she says

12:33.480 --> 12:34.480
hi.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.960
All right, so you're hanging out with her this weekend, right?

12:36.960 --> 12:37.960
Yes, I am.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.680
It's a whole cluster of people going to YowieCon.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.760
We averted a crisis, but she did want me to tell all the listeners hi.

12:42.760 --> 12:43.760
All right, sounds good.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.880
All right, we're going to start to get into some gaming news tonight.

12:46.880 --> 12:47.880
We've got one more thing.

12:47.880 --> 12:48.880
Oh, yes.

12:48.880 --> 12:49.880
Oh, did you get the Battlefield?

12:49.880 --> 12:50.880
I'm so sorry.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.880
The Battlefield contest.

12:51.880 --> 12:52.880
Who won?

12:52.880 --> 12:53.880
We do have a winner.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.320
There was lots of entries, but there could only be one.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.880
There could be only one.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
Your mom.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.680
Drum roll, please.

13:02.680 --> 13:07.640
And the winner of the Battlefield 21-42, I don't remember which year it was.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.120
Get the game name right, please.

13:09.120 --> 13:16.080
The Battlefield 21-42 contest is Jason Tryon from St. Petersburg, Florida.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.080
Congratulations.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.080
Congratulations.

13:18.080 --> 13:24.240
You'll be getting an email with your download code to download the full game with maybe

13:24.240 --> 13:28.680
a few additional extras that we will be talking about a little bit later.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.680
Yay.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.680
Congratulations.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.280
Wait, do I have my sound effect loaded here?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.280
Hold on.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.280
There we go.

13:36.280 --> 13:40.320
Congratulations to you from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.800
We actually have breaking news tonight.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.600
I'm going to interrupt our usual show role here because here at Orange Lounge Radio we

13:45.600 --> 13:46.800
try to plan our stories in advance.

13:46.800 --> 13:52.040
We literally got breaking news about 15 minutes before we went live tonight, and for long

13:52.040 --> 13:57.160
time fans of Orange Lounge Radio who listened to us back in our music gaming days, we know

13:57.160 --> 13:58.440
a lot of you folks are still with us.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.240
This is huge news.

14:00.240 --> 14:05.320
Directly from OrangeLoungeRadio.com, there's a press release today on Roxor's website and

14:05.320 --> 14:07.360
it was short and simple.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.600
Konami Corporation, developer of the Dance Dance Revolution video game, and Roxor Games

14:11.600 --> 14:16.440
Inc., developer of the In the Groove dance games, today announced the mutual settlement

14:16.440 --> 14:20.740
of the litigation between the parties in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District

14:20.740 --> 14:21.960
of Texas.

14:21.960 --> 14:26.100
Under the terms of the settlement, Konami has acquired the intellectual property rights

14:26.100 --> 14:28.840
to the In the Groove dance game franchise.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.480
It was further agreed as a part of the settlement that Roxor would respect Konami's intellectual

14:33.480 --> 14:35.520
property rights.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.520
Translation?

14:36.520 --> 14:37.520
Pwned.

14:37.520 --> 14:42.400
Yeah, so In the Groove dance game fans, not going to be too happy at this news.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.920
I'm going to be honest, I'm hearing a lot of talk already about, oh, this opens the

14:45.920 --> 14:50.840
door for Konami to make DDR versus In the Groove and all this other stuff.

14:50.840 --> 14:55.200
Honestly guys, I think what Konami is going to do with this license, this newly acquired

14:55.200 --> 14:57.840
license so to speak, absolutely nothing.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.240
I think they've got their biggest competitor so to speak and they'll just crush it like

15:02.240 --> 15:03.240
a grape.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.960
It would be a DDR PC too.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.920
Now granted, there may be more information forthcoming later, who knows?

15:11.920 --> 15:15.760
Perhaps Konami will re-explore the PC market with the In the Groove franchise, who knows?

15:15.760 --> 15:19.200
I mean, I'm not going to say for sure I'm the end-all, be-all, know-all of what's going

15:19.200 --> 15:23.280
on but in my mind, that kind of makes the most sense for Konami.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.680
Why dilute the market with more dance games, just make it all DDR?

15:25.680 --> 15:29.760
Well, so they would put out that patch though for In the Groove if they didn't know that

15:29.760 --> 15:31.600
they were going to be losing.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.940
Exactly, and this is another good point that last week there was a patch release for the

15:35.940 --> 15:41.320
arcade game that allows you to play any song you want in the arcade game if you know how

15:41.320 --> 15:43.600
to load it on your USB memory card.

15:43.600 --> 15:51.680
So I do believe now that was the final F-you from Rockstar getting the last cut in before

15:51.680 --> 15:52.680
they went down.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.680
I think they knew that was happening.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.680
And now you have this nice relic on your wall.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.680
I do.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.600
We have a signed In the Groove poster, In the Groove 2 poster from last year's Digital

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
Life.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.080
I'm looking for millions on eBay next week.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.080
Yeah, right.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
I'm kidding.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
Millions of pennies.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.680
Here's a little something else though for those arcade owners out there with an In the

16:08.680 --> 16:14.080
Groove machine with this update on it.

16:14.080 --> 16:21.320
If the RIA catches you playing a song that's not licensed, you can be sued for a lot of

16:21.320 --> 16:22.320
money.

16:22.320 --> 16:28.400
So keep that in mind with this wonderful unlocked machine if you want to.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.720
I mean, you can get sued, so there you go.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.960
What if the arcade has a jukebox license?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.400
If they do, but not many do.

16:35.400 --> 16:41.240
So most of them think, okay, I'm safe because the game's music is licensed.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.200
That doesn't include stuff that people load on there.

16:44.200 --> 16:48.360
Well, more to come on this as it develops here at Orange Lounge Radio.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.440
We would like to open an invitation.

16:50.440 --> 16:55.560
We know there are folks in the music game industry who listen to this program.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.940
If anyone from Rocks or Games would like to come on the show, present their side of things,

16:59.940 --> 17:01.200
the door is open.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.160
If anyone from Konami would like to come on the show and talk about the future of In the

17:04.160 --> 17:07.200
Groove now that they've got it, the door is open.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.720
You can go to the contact us on our website.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.960
We'd love to have you on the program.

17:10.960 --> 17:15.440
That is awesome now that I have the In the Groove 2 beta for PlayStation 2 because that'll

17:15.440 --> 17:17.240
never be released now.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
Probably not.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.880
Never say never, but probably not.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.480
All right, back to the normal list of topics.

17:22.480 --> 17:28.400
Anyways, speaking of stuff that we think will never be released, and that would be a working

17:28.400 --> 17:34.280
firmware for the PSP, but the next big firmware update, 3.0, is coming and supposedly coming

17:34.280 --> 17:39.200
tomorrow, or the 19th for most people out there.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.600
Anyways, what does that mean to you?

17:41.600 --> 17:46.960
Well, if this is the big old firmware story that we've been waiting for, it's going to

17:46.960 --> 17:54.600
have the PlayStation emulation in there, as well as support for linking up to the PlayStation

17:54.600 --> 17:59.000
3 for remote play, whatever the hell that is supposed to be, but I guess we'll find

17:59.000 --> 18:03.640
out when the PlayStation 3 comes out, and it's not a big surprise that that is coming

18:03.640 --> 18:11.440
out tomorrow, seeing as Sony is having their gamer's day for basically covering all the

18:11.440 --> 18:18.760
PlayStation 3 stuff and PSP stuff, you know, on Thursday, so that's pretty cool.

18:18.760 --> 18:25.360
And yeah, so lots of good, lots of big stuff, and I'm sure a lot more ways to stop you from

18:25.360 --> 18:29.240
running homebrew software, so enjoy.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.840
I'm sure this will be on the next Grand Theft Auto anyway, so it'll have to update no matter

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
what.

18:33.840 --> 18:41.040
All right, well, something that's kind of interesting in the Sony area, now this isn't

18:41.040 --> 18:45.320
really officially supported by Sony, but you know, we've been talking about, you know,

18:45.320 --> 18:48.920
high definition, high definition is like the next gen of gaming, well, did you know that

18:48.920 --> 18:52.360
you could do high definition with your PlayStation 2?

18:52.360 --> 18:58.760
Yes, that's right, there is a boot disk that's out there, and it's from, let's see, it's

18:58.760 --> 19:03.600
called the Exploder HDTV Player, and it's by a company called Silicon Era, or at least

19:03.600 --> 19:06.080
that's the, I'm sorry, no, that's the website that originally ran the story.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.280
It's actually Exploder, I think, is the company.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.340
Exploder is the company.

19:10.340 --> 19:15.340
It says here that what you can do is that if you have a 1080i supporting TV, you can

19:15.340 --> 19:20.200
load this tool before starting the game, and then what you can do is inside the menus,

19:20.200 --> 19:24.960
you can select which resolution you want to run the game at, and that this Exploder program

19:24.960 --> 19:31.840
is going to automatically, I suppose, upcode your, you know, existing PlayStation 2 resolution

19:31.840 --> 19:33.460
to 1080i.

19:33.460 --> 19:37.480
No idea exactly how successful that's going to turn out, but if they're putting this product

19:37.480 --> 19:38.920
out there, they must feel pretty confident.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.000
You know what that strangely reminds me of, though?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Blamecast.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.520
Kind of, but this isn't for a specific game.

19:45.520 --> 19:50.240
Well, no, I understand that, but they were wanting to do something very similar to use

19:50.240 --> 19:54.840
the better graphics processing of the Dreamcast to play other PlayStation games, too.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.900
I think it's sort of along the same lines.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.440
So I still don't know if this is something I would pick up, though.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.180
It just seems a little too risky to me, and I don't know if the PlayStation 2 game was

20:05.180 --> 20:06.800
not designed for high def.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.680
It's going to be kind of funky in this transition, so I don't know if that's something I want.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.680
Why?

20:10.680 --> 20:11.680
The PlayStation 3 is doing the same thing.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.680
Oh, okay.

20:12.680 --> 20:13.680
Why not?

20:13.680 --> 20:14.680
All right.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.680
So, I mean, it could happen.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.680
I mean, who knows?

20:16.680 --> 20:17.680
Stranger things, I guess.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.680
All right.

20:18.680 --> 20:25.120
Well, since you brought up the PS3, there actually is a little bit more news about the

20:25.120 --> 20:30.420
Blu-ray discs and the developers that are working on them, that they're actually close

20:30.420 --> 20:33.720
to the 25 gigabyte limit for a lot of the games.

20:33.720 --> 20:40.320
And there's a lot of talk that we're putting movies in there, non-interactive content,

20:40.320 --> 20:51.200
and we pretty much have an admission on that from one of the folks with Sony.

20:51.200 --> 20:59.200
Actually the one to speak with was Phil Harrison, who was the world studio guy.

20:59.200 --> 21:06.080
But basically what he said, and this is a quote, is, I see nothing wrong with having

21:06.080 --> 21:10.220
non-interactive full HD sequences as part of a game.

21:10.220 --> 21:12.840
That's all part of the production value and experience you get when you buy the game.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.960
I don't see that as a weakness at all.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.200
It's a weakness if it's going to cut down on game time and playability.

21:20.200 --> 21:25.600
I think it's a lot of the stuff is, because they are outporting the 1080p, a lot of it's

21:25.600 --> 21:33.360
just higher res textures, or in the case you've got your high def video and stuff in there,

21:33.360 --> 21:36.040
which some of that's fine.

21:36.040 --> 21:41.960
And also they could be doing less compression on it because the Blu-ray drives are slower.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.800
Because they are slower, well actually you would think they would do more compression

21:44.800 --> 21:47.680
if they had slower Blu-ray drives, whatever.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.680
I'm no developer, so what the hell do I know about content?

21:50.680 --> 21:56.520
All I know is 25 gigs is a lot for a game, and it better damn looked good for 25 gigs.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
That's all I got to say.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.520
Wait until they have to deal with the 50.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.160
What are we going to see then?

22:02.160 --> 22:03.160
More movies?

22:03.160 --> 22:04.160
Defective discs.

22:04.160 --> 22:08.800
Hopefully a Playstation 3 that will take out my trash and do my dishes.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
Then I buy it.

22:09.800 --> 22:10.800
At launch.

22:10.800 --> 22:14.800
New for PS3, Turbo Tax!

22:14.800 --> 22:19.480
Anyways, some really cool stuff coming to the Playstation 3, and this is also coming

22:19.480 --> 22:22.600
out of Sony's Gamer Day.

22:22.600 --> 22:27.360
First off, their brand new e-distribution titles, or their Sony arcade, whatever the

22:27.360 --> 22:29.160
hell you want to call it.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.600
Some pretty cool stuff actually.

22:31.600 --> 22:37.840
Very interesting ones, like for example, there's a new game that kind of resembles Geometry

22:37.840 --> 22:42.240
Wars, which is kind of neat, called Blast Factor.

22:42.240 --> 22:46.560
There's going to be Lemmings 2, which apparently is not a port of the original Lemmings 2,

22:46.560 --> 22:51.360
but is a brand new Lemmings game, you know, updated graphics and whatnot.

22:51.360 --> 22:57.520
Go Sudoku, because, god, there's just not enough Sudoku out there.

22:57.520 --> 23:02.000
Swizzle Blocks, which I don't know what that is, but it sounds like a puzzle game.

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
Criminal Crackdown, and, well, Flow, because that was previously announced.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.960
I saw some of the screenshots for some of these games, looked interesting.

23:12.960 --> 23:19.480
I, Blast Factor looked pretty cool, and the graphics looked pretty pristine on it, so

23:19.480 --> 23:22.880
I don't know if it's just a TV or screenshots that they're showing, but...

23:22.880 --> 23:26.620
I'm hoping out of this Gamer's Day thing that will have already happened by the time most

23:26.620 --> 23:31.720
of you hear this, we will see a little more, like, in the means of footage, and kind of

23:31.720 --> 23:35.200
made, like, not so much screenshots, but actual footage, kind of what they look like in action.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.600
You know what I wish they had is like a console that's just these mini-games, because that

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
would be pretty cool.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.600
Well, what about one of those crappy plug-and-play joystick things?

23:43.600 --> 23:47.000
No, I'm talking about, like, an online service or something where you can download, I mean,

23:47.000 --> 23:50.040
I hate these, all these arcade things and stuff.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.720
Isn't that what Phantom wanted to be?

23:51.720 --> 23:53.720
Yeah, but the Phantom was lame.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.720
So wait, so you're...

23:54.720 --> 23:56.480
No, Phantom wanted to do full games.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.280
Did you just say that you want the Phantom to come out?

23:59.280 --> 24:00.840
I did not say I wanted the Phantom to come out.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.360
Are you gonna run over to GameStop and reserve your Phantom?

24:03.360 --> 24:06.440
The Phantom is just a really crappy PC.

24:06.440 --> 24:13.080
Now, granted, the case looked pretty, pretty lame, but actually the case reminded me of

24:13.080 --> 24:16.640
something that would be in, like, Half-Life 2 or something, and I liked the glowing light

24:16.640 --> 24:17.640
on the front.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.720
But that's all I liked about the Phantom, and I wouldn't touch that fucking lap board

24:20.720 --> 24:22.640
with the 10-foot pole.

24:22.640 --> 24:27.840
All right, well, for those that were worried that they may not get a hand on the PlayStation

24:27.840 --> 24:32.680
3 this year, you should probably still be a little bit worried, but it is said that

24:32.680 --> 24:39.560
they are on target to produce 1 million PlayStation 3s in 2006.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.600
Sony has confirmed they are aiming for 1 million PlayStation 3s in North America by the end

24:43.600 --> 24:44.760
of this year.

24:44.760 --> 24:49.040
For day one, we're gonna have a total of 400,000 units for the launch period only for

24:49.040 --> 24:53.120
North America, and we expect to have about 1 million units by the end of the calendar

24:53.120 --> 24:54.120
year.

24:54.120 --> 24:58.720
These are some pretty aggressive numbers, and that comes from Kazurai himself.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.660
So those that were thinking that PlayStation 3 was gonna get delayed a little further in

25:02.660 --> 25:07.160
the U.S., such as something I actually speculated previously on the show, I was wrong.

25:07.160 --> 25:12.440
Yes, and I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is still launching spring of 2006, like they previously

25:12.440 --> 25:13.440
said.

25:13.440 --> 25:17.640
I do think the machine's gonna launch, but I think we're gonna see Xbox 360 shortages

25:17.640 --> 25:19.160
all over again.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.140
I'm not too disappointed.

25:21.140 --> 25:23.560
I don't really need one at launch this time next year.

25:23.560 --> 25:24.760
Yeah, I'll probably have one.

25:24.760 --> 25:28.000
Honestly, the only reason I feel like I should own one of these at launch is because of the

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
show.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.920
But I'll also go to Jamie's house and play hers.

25:30.920 --> 25:35.840
We can see if that 1080p is worth a damn, since my TV will run it.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.840
Yep.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.120
You know what, though?

25:38.120 --> 25:41.680
I think I'm still just gonna use it as a paperweight.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.840
Well, we'll see.

25:42.840 --> 25:43.840
We'll see.

25:43.840 --> 25:48.400
Well, speaking of things to see, I do have a list of release dates for our buddies in

25:48.400 --> 25:50.200
the U.K.

25:50.200 --> 25:55.080
On the 26th is Anos 1701 for PC.

25:55.080 --> 26:00.640
A bunch of other stuff on the 27th, and I'm not going to list all the systems they're

26:00.640 --> 26:06.040
on because there's a few multiple releases, but there's Action Loop, Blade Dancer, Lineage

26:06.040 --> 26:12.160
of Light, Dark Messiah, Might and Magic, Dragon Ball Z, Tenkaichi Budokai 2, Dragon Warriors

26:12.160 --> 26:17.760
Volume 2, FIFA 07, Ford Street Racing, LA Duel, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, Metal

26:17.760 --> 26:23.160
Slug, Metal Slug Anthology, Myst Ultimate Compilation, NBA 2K7, blah, blah, blah, Neo

26:23.160 --> 26:29.640
Geo Battle Colosseum, Pipa Funnel, Pipa Funnel 2 on GBA, by the way, Pipa Funnel, Take the

26:29.640 --> 26:37.320
Reigns, Prince of Persia Trilogy, Pro Evolution Soccer 6, Sudoku Master, Sims 2 Pets, Tiger

26:37.320 --> 26:43.880
Woods PGA Tour 2007, Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Double Agent, Warhammer 40K, War of Dawn,

26:43.880 --> 26:48.400
Dark Crusade, if you want to play Warhammer, just go buy the figures, Zoo Tycoon 2, Marine

26:48.400 --> 26:53.640
Mania, and on the 31st Legend of Spyro, A New Beginning, although I'd just rather go

26:53.640 --> 26:55.160
trick or treating.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.640
Spyro's not that bad.

26:57.640 --> 27:04.440
Spyro is an in-joke on Spyro's message board that I moderate on.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.400
I'm going to be seeing Whoop 11 on that day, so screw Spyro.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.400
Anywho...

27:08.400 --> 27:09.400
Nerd!

27:09.400 --> 27:10.400
I know!

27:10.400 --> 27:11.800
Did you get any more nerdier tonight?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.480
I'm going to go see a Trekkie band.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.440
Are you wearing a pocket protector?

27:15.440 --> 27:16.440
No.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.440
Anywho...

27:17.440 --> 27:19.880
I do have a chainmail bra.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.560
La la la la la.

27:22.560 --> 27:26.040
So there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week.

27:26.040 --> 27:29.640
We've actually got some pretty cool stuff like, for example, Marvel Ultimate Alliance

27:29.640 --> 27:36.000
will be coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, and the 360, and I believe the PSP as well.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.200
Some other fun games, Reservoir Dogs, the ultra-violent game, will be on Playstation

27:40.200 --> 27:41.840
2 and Xbox.

27:41.840 --> 27:47.120
We've got Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, and GameCube.

27:47.120 --> 27:54.840
Nicktoons Battle for Volcano Island on Playstation 2, GameCube DS, and Game Boy Advance.

27:54.840 --> 28:01.200
And of course, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam will be coming out on the DS and Game Boy Advance,

28:01.200 --> 28:03.200
so that should be pretty neat.

28:03.200 --> 28:08.000
And of course for you RPG fans, we've got Phantasy Star Universe coming out on Playstation

28:08.000 --> 28:12.620
2, PC, and on the 360.

28:12.620 --> 28:17.720
And other fun stuff, well these are a little bit way off now, and even more way off than

28:17.720 --> 28:19.920
we mentioned last week.

28:19.920 --> 28:26.280
I unfortunately have to give you guys the bad news that DDR Universe has been delayed

28:26.280 --> 28:28.760
into March of 2007.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.480
How do you know this?

28:30.480 --> 28:31.480
From my work.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.480
Alright.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.480
It's from Konami themselves.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.480
Alright.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.320
So, you know, I'm not surprised because all their other games...

28:37.320 --> 28:39.040
Could they change it back?

28:39.040 --> 28:40.240
It could very well change back.

28:40.240 --> 28:46.200
I don't think it will change back, because that's a pretty large jump there, so yeah.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.920
I would say March, because it makes sense, I mean it's just like Beatmania last year,

28:49.920 --> 28:52.120
so no big deal.

28:52.120 --> 28:56.040
There have been some price drops on some 360 games in case you're interested.

28:56.040 --> 29:00.120
You know what though, I want to say real quick, for folks that were very critical of DDR Universe's

29:00.120 --> 29:04.400
build at E3, that could actually be good news that they went back and retooled some things.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.600
Because you know a lot of people were bitching about the interface on Universe and things

29:07.600 --> 29:08.600
like that.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.920
Remember when people complained about UltraMix 2, they went back and retooled it, and that

29:12.920 --> 29:16.960
came out, in my mind, still the best DDR home release they've done yet.

29:16.960 --> 29:22.480
So I'm not saying they are, I don't know, but that could be good news.

29:22.480 --> 29:27.560
I'd rather them wait and get it right, you know.

29:27.560 --> 29:28.560
Let's see, well anyways...

29:28.560 --> 29:31.120
Or they're putting in the groove songs in it.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.640
Just kidding, no.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.320
A few price drops here.

29:35.320 --> 29:40.200
We have Hitman Blood Money for the 360s dropped down to $39.99.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.720
Every other version for Hitman Blood Money has actually dropped $10, so that's pretty

29:44.720 --> 29:45.720
good.

29:45.720 --> 29:50.000
Tomb Raider Legends dropped down to $29.99 for the 360, and all the other versions have

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
dropped also $10.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.400
And finally, Condemned, which wasn't that expensive to begin with, and actually was

29:56.400 --> 29:59.560
$39.99 for a while now, is now $29.99.

29:59.560 --> 30:03.080
So if you haven't picked it up yet, probably a good time to do it.

30:03.080 --> 30:08.640
Because it is the only Survivor Horror game, pretty much, on the 360.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.880
Comments in our chatroom on Spyro.

30:10.880 --> 30:15.080
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I remember I had a Spyro game for the GBA, and I got stuck on the 4th

30:15.080 --> 30:17.920
or 5th world, and then I gave it away.

30:17.920 --> 30:22.360
Separoth1215 says, Spyro is now voiced by Elijah Wood, I guess that's further proof

30:22.360 --> 30:23.360
he's jumped the shark.

30:23.360 --> 30:27.200
SSJ100Matt says, Spyro needs to end, it's time for him to grow up and burninate the

30:27.200 --> 30:28.200
countryside.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.200
There you go.

30:29.200 --> 30:34.000
Well I was going to mention also, there was a game that actually came out last week, or

30:34.000 --> 30:37.920
this week depending on when you're listening to the show I guess.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.120
Splinter Cell Double Agent for the 360.

30:40.120 --> 30:45.060
It is going to be one of the first titles that will support the brand new fall dashboard

30:45.060 --> 30:48.600
update for the 360, and it will support 1080p.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.600
So that's pretty sweet.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.920
Well we'll have to see how sexy that looks on a TV that can support it.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.000
Again, we'll be going over to Jamie's house.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.560
Because she has to have all the big toys, because she's a nerd.

30:59.560 --> 31:05.320
Hey, it's not just me, it's the fact that my husband has this, oh my god I need resolution!

31:05.320 --> 31:08.040
I need a TV that's bigger than god!

31:08.040 --> 31:11.720
Speaking of nerds, you have to be a little bit nerdy if you're importing your games from

31:11.720 --> 31:12.720
Japan.

31:12.720 --> 31:17.560
You know, I've imported a couple games from Japan, I wear that nerd badge with pride.

31:17.560 --> 31:21.660
For those of you guys that are importing games from Japan, here's some games that are coming

31:21.660 --> 31:24.480
out this week, or if you live in Japan, and you can just walk down the street and pick

31:24.480 --> 31:25.640
up some of these games.

31:25.640 --> 31:32.880
We have Nizu no Senoritsu 2, I'm sorry Senoritsu 2, which is coming out from Kid, it's an adventure

31:32.880 --> 31:37.080
game, and of course it's the sequel to Nizu no Senoritsu 1, which is entering best hits

31:37.080 --> 31:38.400
as well this week.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.840
That all goes down on October 26th, 2006.

31:41.840 --> 31:45.960
Princess Princess comes out from Marvelous Entertainment, it's also an adventure game.

31:45.960 --> 31:50.720
I noticed the cover has these three anime looking chicks, who I would speculate might

31:50.720 --> 31:52.640
be the princesses in this game.

31:52.640 --> 31:58.640
Although there's two princesses in that title and three on the box, so, I don't know.

31:58.640 --> 32:03.880
Also coming out from D3 is Mermaid Prism, another adventure game coming out October

32:03.880 --> 32:05.200
26th.

32:05.200 --> 32:10.360
And lastly on my list here we have Utaware Rumono, yet another adventure game, but this

32:10.360 --> 32:13.640
one coming to us from Aqua Plus.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.440
Check that out this week in Japan.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.440
Sweet.

32:16.440 --> 32:18.920
Is that Utaware?

32:18.920 --> 32:21.140
Oh, probably.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.800
Why do I do the Japanese releases?

32:23.800 --> 32:26.280
I've never taken a lick of a Japanese class.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.280
I think we need to.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.480
I mean, I love our UK people, but I can trade.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.520
I love them too.

32:32.520 --> 32:33.520
Let me at them.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.880
I love our Japanese people too.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.880
Alright.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.720
We'll talk that up behind the scenes, because you've actually had Japanese class, so I butcher

32:38.720 --> 32:39.720
those words.

32:39.720 --> 32:40.720
So.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.720
I was just wondering.

32:41.720 --> 32:42.720
I openly admit.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.720
I can't see through you.

32:43.720 --> 32:49.520
I just did the Japanese release dates because they were lonely and needed some love.

32:49.520 --> 32:53.980
No one was talking about them anywhere, so, you know.

32:53.980 --> 33:00.360
I took them into my home and I sheltered them, even if I did horribly butcher their names.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.360
And releasing in Antarctica?

33:02.360 --> 33:03.360
Nothing.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.360
Sorry, guys.

33:05.360 --> 33:12.080
However, being released in nowhere is actually, speaking of things that aren't actually going

33:12.080 --> 33:20.840
to be making it out, I should say, the major UK retailers, Currys and Dixons, are not going

33:20.840 --> 33:29.440
to be stocking Canis Canem Edit, which, for those of us in the US, is a bully.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.360
One of their spokespeople said, we have no plans to stock Canis Canem Edit.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.600
We are fully aware people will be able to buy this game elsewhere, but we feel this

33:36.600 --> 33:41.400
game is not appropriate for Currys' family-friendly image.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
Eat it.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.400
It's Latin, right?

33:43.400 --> 33:44.400
Okay.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.240
I don't think I take Latin.

33:47.240 --> 33:48.240
You do the Japanese words.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.240
I'll do the Latin words.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.240
Here we go.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.240
Whatever.

33:52.240 --> 33:55.400
Orange Lounge Radio.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.840
We are high school graduates.

33:56.840 --> 34:00.640
Anyway, it's going to be out October 27th.

34:00.640 --> 34:04.440
It has a 15 rating.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.440
It's not that bad of a game.

34:05.440 --> 34:10.800
It got really good reviews and apparently the character at the end, spoiler alert, becomes

34:10.800 --> 34:15.640
an upstanding citizen who gives more than he takes.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.440
And makes out with boys as well as girls.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.840
Is this true?

34:18.840 --> 34:21.240
I think there are certain characters that you can make out with.

34:21.240 --> 34:23.520
I need to quit this game.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.520
No thank you.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.520
The kid's what, 15?

34:25.520 --> 34:28.520
No thank you.

34:28.520 --> 34:33.040
Anyways, Grand Theft Auto IV.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.040
Again, it's way off.

34:34.040 --> 34:36.360
It's supposed to be coming out in October next year.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.360
Like a year from now?

34:37.360 --> 34:38.360
Yeah.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.360
And I cannot wait.

34:39.360 --> 34:45.480
But no, anyway, the PlayStation 3 is also getting exclusive episodic content.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.720
Okay, listen now.

34:47.720 --> 34:53.220
Rockstar, do you know what the word exclusive means?

34:53.220 --> 34:57.200
It means one system, Getty, the other system, no Getty.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.920
So you know what?

34:58.920 --> 35:03.440
Maybe both Getty, some content, okay.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.760
Anyways, so both of them will have online.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.140
Don't ever read children's story time books.

35:09.140 --> 35:12.080
Don't ever do that because you can't do it.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.400
Shut up.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.400
She can't speak Latin.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.620
I can't speak Japanese and you can't read to children.

35:16.620 --> 35:17.800
That's fine.

35:17.800 --> 35:23.240
Anyways, so yeah, it's going to get episodic content, not a big surprise, and what might

35:23.240 --> 35:26.880
be different is the content might be different for each platform, who knows.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.400
My guess, no, because they are lazy, so it will be the same on both platforms.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.560
I think you're wrong.

35:31.560 --> 35:36.360
I think it's like Soul Calibur II, where you had one character on the, I'm not saying literally

35:36.360 --> 35:40.520
this is it, but you know how you had Link on the GameCube and Spawn on the Xbox and

35:40.520 --> 35:45.320
Heihachi on the PlayStation, and it was, you know, that was their exclusive content per

35:45.320 --> 35:46.320
console.

35:46.320 --> 35:50.220
What you're going to get in Grand Theft Auto is you're going to get like, you know, West

35:50.220 --> 35:56.440
Island on the PlayStation and East Island on the Xbox, and the Wii gets nothing.

35:56.440 --> 36:02.800
Rob, if you've ever played the multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories,

36:02.800 --> 36:03.800
they're lazy.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.160
They are not going to make new content.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.280
We would be lucky if the original content works correctly.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.860
If we had to wait a goddamn year for the game, I would think they have enough time to make

36:12.860 --> 36:17.120
West Island and East Island.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.560
West Side and East Side.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
Exactly.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.560
I was waiting for that.

36:21.560 --> 36:25.120
Meanwhile, who won that Battlefield thing earlier in the show?

36:25.120 --> 36:26.120
That was Jason from Florida?

36:26.120 --> 36:27.120
Yeah.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.120
I think that was his name.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.120
All right.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.080
Well, Jason from Florida, be careful before you install Battlefield 2142.

36:32.080 --> 36:36.160
Something you might want to consider is that this letter that leaked to various gaming

36:36.160 --> 36:43.440
blogs this week that basically says that there is IGA advertising technology in the game.

36:43.440 --> 36:48.840
Now, the purpose of this technology is to deliver advertisements when you use the software

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
on the Internet.

36:49.840 --> 36:55.080
It's basically going to collect anonymous information to measure what types of ads you

36:55.080 --> 36:59.540
should be seeing based on, you know, where you live and things of that nature.

36:59.540 --> 37:02.920
It's kind of anonymously looking at your IP or what have you.

37:02.920 --> 37:07.720
And of course, everyone is going flipping nuts on forums about this, like, how dare

37:07.720 --> 37:14.600
EA spy on me, how this is an invasion of my privacy, I was going to buy Battlefield 2142

37:14.600 --> 37:17.280
but now I'm not, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.800
Loki had some strong opinions on this.

37:18.800 --> 37:19.800
Yeah.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.000
It's retarded is what it is.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.300
And the reason it's retarded is because this is retarded or the reaction, the backlash

37:26.300 --> 37:27.300
is retarded.

37:27.300 --> 37:28.520
And this is why.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.380
It's for just those fucking dynamic ads that are in the game.

37:32.380 --> 37:36.680
But all it looks at is your IP address to figure out where the hell in the world you

37:36.680 --> 37:37.680
are.

37:37.680 --> 37:42.360
So if you're in France, that the ads aren't in English, they're in French or they're for

37:42.360 --> 37:46.160
products that come out in France, you know, stuff like that.

37:46.160 --> 37:51.840
So it, you know, and also it's collecting information on how many views of said ad you

37:51.840 --> 37:58.520
have made so that they can go and, you know, bill whomever, you know, their clients.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.640
Our friend and pal and buddy VXChaseNXV in chat is jumping up and down screaming.

38:02.640 --> 38:07.560
An IP address is not anonymous information, grr argh.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.560
Get over it, people.

38:08.560 --> 38:12.440
Seriously, it's not like saying we're collecting your credit card information.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.760
We're going to be watching where you're browsing on the internet.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.200
It's just a goddamn IP.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.040
It's just figuring out where you are in the world.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.560
I don't think EA is the first company to be watching you.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.560
No.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.560
War of the Warcraft.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.600
Every time you sign into Xbox Live, Microsoft knows what you're playing and they track it

38:25.600 --> 38:27.760
on the internet for your friends to see.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.200
So War of the Warcraft, you know, they, you know, monitor your computer for spyware, but

38:31.200 --> 38:35.040
oh my God, they can be monitoring for other things, you know.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.040
It's just, whatever.

38:36.040 --> 38:40.160
I used somebody's IP address to track down when I was being stalked.

38:40.160 --> 38:47.840
Well, yeah, I mean, you could, I don't, they might be collecting your IP address, but they're

38:47.840 --> 38:48.840
just using that for this.

38:48.840 --> 38:49.840
I don't think they care where your house is.

38:49.840 --> 38:52.400
Yeah, I don't think they're going to come knock on your door, sir, you've been playing

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
too much of our game.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.280
Well, they don't care that, you know, you've been looking, you know, it's, you know, porn

38:57.280 --> 38:58.280
all the day.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.520
What they should have done, I guess, what would be the common, you know, the happy medium

39:01.520 --> 39:06.800
here is have you sign up on their website or whatever, putting your address information

39:06.800 --> 39:11.640
in there and then you don't have to have your IP tracked because they'll go off that address

39:11.640 --> 39:14.920
and send you ads based on where you live via that.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.840
DMN says, but this allows for date people in insert zip code here.

39:18.840 --> 39:19.840
That shit's annoying.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.720
Microsoft doesn't hit you with shitty ads.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.280
Yes, they do.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.040
Download our artist video of the month on Xbox Live this week.

39:27.040 --> 39:31.160
Buy a Yaris from the Xbox Live Arcade because no one else is.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.160
Buy a Sion.

39:32.160 --> 39:39.160
I just feel sorry for people like in my home state having to see ads for, you know, all

39:39.160 --> 39:41.680
kinds of, you know, heat hauling.

39:41.680 --> 39:47.000
What about the official Xbox Magazine that makes you watch stupid commercials to unlock

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
points in their disk to unlock a further demo, which by the way is probably already on Xbox

39:53.000 --> 39:56.960
Live Marketplace anyways.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.440
What I think is interesting though, let's look at the bigger picture here.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.000
Loki, what do you think of this?

40:01.000 --> 40:04.400
The bigger picture that people are saying is bullshit, is that I'm paying, you know,

40:04.400 --> 40:08.840
60 bucks, 50 bucks, whatever for a game that has advertising in it.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.840
That's too much money.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.240
If the game has advertising in it, it shouldn't cost me that much money.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.280
Does it cost you anything to play online?

40:15.280 --> 40:17.320
No, it doesn't.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.320
You know why?

40:18.320 --> 40:24.480
Because that money that they're making from advertising helps run the servers.

40:24.480 --> 40:29.040
I'm just surprised that someone with such a philosophy is actually kind of supporting

40:29.040 --> 40:30.040
this in a way.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.040
It's kind of interesting.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.360
I don't see a problem with it, and to be honest, so what?

40:33.360 --> 40:36.820
There's fucking ads on billboards that are in this world.

40:36.820 --> 40:43.720
It's not like, you know, my character has a fucking, you know, date hot people or whatever

40:43.720 --> 40:47.960
in this zip code strapped to his body or something.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.460
It's not like they're that obtrusive.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.080
They're just on fucking billboards.

40:51.080 --> 40:55.100
I don't notice what the hell are on billboards in the game, and if you're sitting there staring

40:55.100 --> 40:59.120
at the fucking billboard, you're probably going to get shot or stepped on by a giant

40:59.120 --> 41:00.120
robot.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.040
So, whatever.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.840
If you're really going to get your panties in the bunch for that, I don't want to see

41:05.840 --> 41:08.480
you playing Battlefield 2142 anyways.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.840
Go play another game.

41:09.840 --> 41:14.120
VX Jason says, give me the ability to run my own server and fuck your advertisements.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.120
You think people are going to end up hacking this game to take the shit out?

41:17.120 --> 41:18.440
Sure, why not?

41:18.440 --> 41:23.120
They've done it before with other games, so I don't see why they couldn't.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
All right.

41:24.120 --> 41:30.320
Well, all this talk of privacy and invading our privacy and, you know, ruffling our feathers

41:30.320 --> 41:31.320
here.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.680
It's, you know, the internet versus EA and what have you.

41:33.680 --> 41:41.520
It makes us a little bit angsty, so that means we have to bring on the FUs of the week.

41:41.520 --> 41:59.960
Yes, the antibiotic that they prescribe quite often for a sinus infection, so I guess it

41:59.960 --> 42:04.920
really is rooted to my sinus infection that I'm still not, you know, done with.

42:04.920 --> 42:10.400
But I would like to actually be able to digest solid food, please, drugs, hurry up and be

42:10.400 --> 42:15.040
done with me so that I can actually eat a pizza without wanting to die.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.160
Not love me.

42:18.160 --> 42:22.520
F you to my head hurting because I have a headache right now and it's one of those ones

42:22.520 --> 42:27.160
that's not really that bad, but it's in the back of my skull and that sucks because there's

42:27.160 --> 42:33.520
no way to get rid of it, so I fucking hate that and I get them so often.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.520
It's from your neck?

42:34.520 --> 42:36.360
It's from a tumor.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.520
It's not a tumor.

42:37.520 --> 42:42.400
F you to the fact that I'm getting on a red-eye flight tomorrow night to New York City and

42:42.400 --> 42:43.480
I'm getting sick.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.040
I can feel my body getting sick.

42:45.040 --> 42:48.000
I know this because I was cold in my office all day and I usually don't get cold unless

42:48.000 --> 42:50.160
I'm getting sick, so that's just great.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.960
I'm getting sick to ruin my vacation in New York City.

42:52.960 --> 42:53.960
Yay!

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
Joint excitement.

42:54.960 --> 42:55.960
F you to viruses.

42:55.960 --> 42:56.960
New York City?

42:56.960 --> 42:57.960
Sorry.

42:57.960 --> 42:58.960
Shut up.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.960
Get a rope.

43:00.960 --> 43:07.720
Anyways, moving on.

43:07.720 --> 43:15.400
Well, speaking of things that are moving at least, we've got a track listing for Elite

43:15.400 --> 43:22.400
Beat Agents, so if anybody who is interested, and actually, again, the release for that

43:22.400 --> 43:28.840
is going to be November 6th over here in the US, but the songs that are going to be in

43:28.840 --> 43:35.200
it is Walkie Talkie Man by Stereogram, ABC, Jackson 5, Skater Boy, Avril Lavigne, I Was

43:35.200 --> 43:39.480
Born to Love You, Queen, Rock This Town, Stray Cats, which is a great song, Highway Star,

43:39.480 --> 43:45.400
Deep Purple, YMCA, Village People, September, Earth, Wind & Fire, Canned Heat, Jamiroquai,

43:45.400 --> 43:52.800
Material Girl, Madonna, Lala, Ashley Simpson, you're the inspiration, Chicago.

43:52.800 --> 43:56.560
You know I used to actually have that on a 45.

43:56.560 --> 43:59.760
Nerd.

43:59.760 --> 44:02.680
No that just meant it was the 80s.

44:02.680 --> 44:10.360
Survivor, Destiny's Child, Without a Fight, Hoobastank, Believe, Cher, that's so gay,

44:10.360 --> 44:14.480
Let's Dance, David Bowie, I love David Bowie, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Rolling Stones, Makes

44:14.480 --> 44:18.160
No Difference, Sum 41, The Anthem, Good Charlotte.

44:18.160 --> 44:23.080
Well, this will certainly ruffle the feathers of those folks that were expecting to get

44:23.080 --> 44:28.520
more Japanese style music, but if that's what you wanted, import Oh and Don.

44:28.520 --> 44:31.200
I thought they were expecting to get Japanese music.

44:31.200 --> 44:35.240
Exactly, so this is certainly an Americanized version, it definitely is going to take this

44:35.240 --> 44:39.060
series in a completely different direction.

44:39.060 --> 44:43.800
You know what, although there's a couple of songs on that list that made me go, ugh, you

44:43.800 --> 44:48.140
know any music game is going to have a couple songs that made me go, ugh, so I'm okay with

44:48.140 --> 44:49.140
it.

44:49.140 --> 44:51.360
I think it'll actually be fun, there's some kind of funny songs on there, so it should

44:51.360 --> 44:53.200
be interesting to see it in this system.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.720
I'm upset with this track list.

44:54.720 --> 44:55.720
Why?

44:55.720 --> 45:02.960
Because any time that Cher song is seen anywhere with my eyes, it gets stuck in my head, and

45:02.960 --> 45:10.280
I can't get it out, and I also think of that Margaret Cho act too where she was talking

45:10.280 --> 45:11.280
about it.

45:11.280 --> 45:13.600
Yay, I know what game to play every time Jamie's over.

45:13.600 --> 45:17.760
You know what, I know which ass to kick every time I'm over.

45:17.760 --> 45:24.880
Yes, speaking of ass kicking, Red Octane or Activision have basically kicked the ass of

45:24.880 --> 45:30.000
any third party guitar controller, because according to the official PlayStation Magazine

45:30.000 --> 45:36.240
demo of Guitar Hero 2, they will not work, so if that's indicative of the final game,

45:36.240 --> 45:41.600
your third party controller will no worky on the brand new game, so that kind of sucks.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.420
At least this is based on the demo, right?

45:43.420 --> 45:50.240
Based on the demo, but you know what, I don't know, how hard could it be to get a controller

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
to work?

45:51.240 --> 45:55.360
I mean seriously, so, I don't know, we'll see, I'm sure people will find a workaround

45:55.360 --> 46:01.160
for that, but as of right now, that's kind of poopy, seeing as Red Octane started off

46:01.160 --> 46:06.480
as a third party controller manufacturer, and now they're just kind of saying, fuck

46:06.480 --> 46:07.880
you all.

46:07.880 --> 46:11.680
Yeah, so let me get this straight.

46:11.680 --> 46:18.520
A company that got its start as a third party peripheral manufacturer has effectively locked

46:18.520 --> 46:24.160
out third party peripheral manufacturers from their latest games.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.280
It's a preemptive strike.

46:26.280 --> 46:30.040
It's cutting out future competition for other third party.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.040
It's interesting.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.040
It's an interesting tactic.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.040
I mean that's business.

46:33.040 --> 46:37.560
You can hem and haw all you want about Red Octane or bastard people, they're hypocrites,

46:37.560 --> 46:39.400
blah, blah, blah, but that's just business.

46:39.400 --> 46:44.760
There was basically the official controller, they way it kind of recognized it was an official

46:44.760 --> 46:49.960
controller is because they had the left button shorted out, kind of like how pop-in music

46:49.960 --> 46:51.000
has that.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.640
They have a button shorted out to be able to detect that it's the official pop-in music

46:54.640 --> 46:55.640
controller.

46:55.640 --> 47:02.080
What's interesting though is there's some speculation that this was to lock out those

47:02.080 --> 47:08.240
third party wireless controllers because Red Octane was coming out with their own wireless

47:08.240 --> 47:10.560
controller for the PlayStation 2.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.560
Interesting.

47:11.560 --> 47:16.440
Well, if guitars aren't your thing and singing is more your style, you already know the karaoke

47:16.440 --> 47:21.160
revolution American Idol is coming out on the PlayStation 2 pretty soon and Konami is

47:21.160 --> 47:27.400
going to be launching a tour to find the first virtual American Idol.

47:27.400 --> 47:31.880
And if you win this and you are the virtual American Idol, you will win airfare, accommodations

47:31.880 --> 47:37.040
and tickets to a taping of the real American Idol TV show so you can look at the better

47:37.040 --> 47:38.040
singers.

47:38.040 --> 47:39.720
Oh boy.

47:39.720 --> 47:44.720
Even if you just participate, you'll still get, what is this, a contest t-shirt and a

47:44.720 --> 47:49.240
coupon for $5 off when pre-ordering through konami.com.

47:49.240 --> 47:51.980
If you win in your region, you do get a free copy of the game.

47:51.980 --> 47:56.820
So this is going on tour around the nation and let's see, Loki, I want you to keep November

47:56.820 --> 48:02.840
4th clear because we're taking a trip to San Francisco to go to the Stone's Town Galleria

48:02.840 --> 48:05.280
because you know you owe it to the listeners to participate in this.

48:05.280 --> 48:06.280
I am not doing this.

48:06.280 --> 48:07.280
Oh yes, he is, folks.

48:07.280 --> 48:08.280
No, I'm not.

48:08.280 --> 48:12.280
And we're going to tape the whole thing for the future of the Ontario TV project.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.280
I am not doing this.

48:13.280 --> 48:14.280
Yes, you are.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.280
It's fine.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.280
I am not doing this.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.280
I know.

48:17.280 --> 48:18.280
You're going to play this little game here where you're going to say you're not going

48:18.280 --> 48:19.280
to do it.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.280
No, I'm not.

48:20.280 --> 48:22.800
And then we're going to get him and then it's supposed to be a surprise, folks.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.640
He's just being sheepish.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.640
Don't worry.

48:25.640 --> 48:28.200
We'll have him there and root for him if you're in San Francisco.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.720
I am not playing that damn game.

48:30.720 --> 48:36.200
Bring your Loki signs, like they have on the show, Loki is my American Idol.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.320
You know who we should take to that?

48:38.320 --> 48:39.720
Iguana Girl.

48:39.720 --> 48:45.240
We should, but we'll take her to another city because I've got to have Loki win this one.

48:45.240 --> 48:46.240
No.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.040
Iguana Girl can go and be the real winner.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.040
That's fine.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.960
Oh, see, look, you're getting support from our chat.

48:52.960 --> 48:53.960
Look at all the...

48:53.960 --> 48:56.800
They're so excited that you're going to be saying, what song are you going to do when

48:56.800 --> 48:58.840
you try out for Karaoke Revolution America?

48:58.840 --> 49:00.040
I'm not playing that game.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.040
I know, I know.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.040
Yeah, that's right, Matt.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.040
Keep telling yourself that.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.120
I'm not driving down there either.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.120
Anyways.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.120
I'll drive.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.120
It's fine.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
No.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.120
I won't even charge you for gas.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.760
Jamie will chip in for gas.

49:11.760 --> 49:12.760
We'll go and dutch.

49:12.760 --> 49:13.760
With what money?

49:13.760 --> 49:14.760
I'm poor.

49:14.760 --> 49:15.760
Anyways.

49:15.760 --> 49:17.760
I'll sell the ferret.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.240
Oh, my baby.

49:19.240 --> 49:25.920
If dancing is more of your thing, you'll be happy to know that the ever rumored, because

49:25.920 --> 49:33.400
everyone wanted a DDR MMO, well, Dave Perry, who you might remember from Shiny, is creating

49:33.400 --> 49:38.200
a new MMO called Dance, which is promising players will have a chance to create their

49:38.200 --> 49:43.480
own unique dancers, and through variable styles, facial features, and clothing accessories,

49:43.480 --> 49:45.680
you can also be able to actually play.

49:45.680 --> 49:52.840
It sounds very similar to O2Jam or something like that, but it should be pretty interesting.

49:52.840 --> 49:56.480
Obviously, when I first read the news on this, it sounds very similar to one of those popular

49:56.480 --> 50:01.800
Korean music games, such as O2Jam, R2B, one of those types of games, kind of an Americanized

50:01.800 --> 50:05.800
dish, you know, I wouldn't say it's an Americanized version of this, but that idea, that concept

50:05.800 --> 50:09.640
in a localized MMO should be interesting.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.120
I'll check it out if it's free.

50:11.120 --> 50:14.640
I mean, it can't be free, right?

50:14.640 --> 50:16.640
Exactly.

50:16.640 --> 50:20.080
Will they be watching my IP, though, and delivering me in-game ads?

50:20.080 --> 50:21.080
You betcha.

50:21.080 --> 50:26.320
Actually, I think this was one of the ones that they were talking about supporting it

50:26.320 --> 50:30.400
with ads, because it was going to be free, but it might have been another game, I don't

50:30.400 --> 50:31.400
know.

50:31.400 --> 50:32.400
All right.

50:32.400 --> 50:36.600
Well, every week, you send us emails, and Dark Soccer writes down your IPs with a big

50:36.600 --> 50:37.600
magic marker.

50:37.600 --> 50:41.000
And then I lock them down to your zip code.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.200
Sends them to the spam factory to say, no, I'm just kidding.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.900
Of course, we never give out your emails, addresses, or IP.

50:46.900 --> 50:48.560
We wouldn't do that to you.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.560
We're not the man.

50:49.560 --> 50:52.160
But we will read what you write to us on air.

50:52.160 --> 50:56.200
Actually, I find where you live, and if your letter sucks, I leave Stinky Poo on your front

50:56.200 --> 50:57.200
doorstep.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.200
Oh, I see.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.200
All right.

50:59.200 --> 51:04.160
Well, hopefully, we've got some letters that did not earn a poo bombing this week.

51:04.160 --> 51:09.480
Dark Soccer, open up the mailbag and pull some emails out for us.

51:09.480 --> 51:16.840
The first one comes from, well, it doesn't really have a name on it, so I'm just going

51:16.840 --> 51:19.040
to say Pendragon.

51:19.040 --> 51:24.600
Actually, Aibo is not useless.

51:24.600 --> 51:27.280
I've had this ERS-7 since they first came out.

51:27.280 --> 51:30.280
He watches my house when I'm not there, and he has his own blog on the web.

51:30.280 --> 51:33.280
Meet Falco at FusionCrew.org slash Falco.

51:33.280 --> 51:36.600
That would be kind of funny.

51:36.600 --> 51:41.560
I did want to get one at one point, but they're just too damn expensive.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.040
I want an Eibo.

51:43.040 --> 51:48.120
I'm in shock someone wrote us to tell us they have an Eibo that has a blog.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.920
My Xbox 360 has a blog.

51:49.920 --> 51:55.040
I want an Eibo that has a blog and that we'll be walking around because it randomly takes

51:55.040 --> 51:56.040
pictures and stuff.

51:56.040 --> 51:59.400
It's like, oh, look, there's people having sex on the couch or something like that and

51:59.400 --> 52:00.400
posts a blog.

52:00.400 --> 52:07.600
It would just get more pictures of your foot, but I'm going to start a PayPal account for

52:07.600 --> 52:08.600
myself.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.560
The donate to Dark Soccer's Eibo fund.

52:11.560 --> 52:12.560
You do that.

52:12.560 --> 52:15.080
Let's see if I get an Eibo.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.080
Come on, chat room.

52:16.080 --> 52:18.240
You know you want to help me get an Eibo to replace the ferret.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.240
Sell your goddamn TV.

52:19.240 --> 52:20.240
Then you can afford an Eibo.

52:20.240 --> 52:25.080
I'll get an Eibo and I'll name him Ferret.

52:25.080 --> 52:28.120
Anyway, this is when I get my wireless router working the right way again.

52:28.120 --> 52:32.400
You can email Falco and he'll take a picture and email it back to you.

52:32.400 --> 52:36.400
That's at ibofalco.comcast.net, so I think that's pretty funny.

52:36.400 --> 52:42.680
By the way, he wants us to pick him for the drawing, but I think it's a little too late.

52:42.680 --> 52:43.680
Sorry.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.680
Maybe you should have entered your Eibo.

52:45.680 --> 52:48.200
Dude, I want an Eibo.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.200
I want an Eibo to win a contest.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.600
We should have a world's sexiest Eibo contest.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.720
I don't want one of those ones that actually look like dogs.

52:53.720 --> 52:56.160
I want one of the old school Eibos.

52:56.160 --> 52:57.160
You just need to...

52:57.160 --> 52:58.160
They're really cool.

52:58.160 --> 52:59.160
Anyway.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.160
This one comes from Gomez.

53:00.160 --> 53:02.200
Hey, Orange Lounge.

53:02.200 --> 53:05.320
This is the first time I've ever sent you guys an email because I'm kind of an Orange

53:05.320 --> 53:08.800
Lounge noob because I only started listening about episode 196.

53:08.800 --> 53:10.160
Nice run on sentence.

53:10.160 --> 53:11.160
Welcome to the show.

53:11.160 --> 53:14.560
I'm glad you've decided to stick around.

53:14.560 --> 53:17.720
I love the show and the praise you give Xbox 360 LOL.

53:17.720 --> 53:21.160
However, my friends and I have been having some problems with the system.

53:21.160 --> 53:24.840
My controllers now have a mandatory tape job on the back of them to keep the batteries

53:24.840 --> 53:28.840
connected so the controller does not disconnect due to a loss of power, which makes me really

53:28.840 --> 53:29.840
mad.

53:29.840 --> 53:33.200
But this doesn't compare to a friend of mine whose Xbox broke just recently, but Microsoft

53:33.200 --> 53:36.280
was generous enough to give him a new one, which within a week was also broken.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.280
He had to endure another couple of months without an Xbox, even though he had just bought

53:40.280 --> 53:41.280
NHL07.

53:41.280 --> 53:43.720
Dude, you're like the king of run on sentences.

53:43.720 --> 53:44.720
This is awesome.

53:44.720 --> 53:45.720
NHL07?

53:45.720 --> 53:46.720
Boo.

53:46.720 --> 53:51.480
The system can be a hassle when it freezes on me or the controllers disconnect in the

53:51.480 --> 53:55.520
middle of a game or battle, but nothing makes me more mad than the controller disconnect

53:55.520 --> 53:56.880
and because of this my Xbox freezes.

53:56.880 --> 54:00.240
Either way, I love my Xbox 360 because of the fantastic graphics and games, and yet

54:00.240 --> 54:01.560
I hate the frustrations.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.640
I guess I hate it and love it.

54:03.640 --> 54:09.280
The other topic I had to say was to do with the new Phantasy Star Universe demo that came

54:09.280 --> 54:11.040
out to the marketplace recently.

54:11.040 --> 54:14.920
Since I've downloaded pretty much every demo I had to play, this one pretty much got me

54:14.920 --> 54:17.080
hooked but not before some difficulty.

54:17.080 --> 54:20.760
I originally made myself one of those robot guy characters and pretty much held the A

54:20.760 --> 54:24.480
button through the whole tutorial while talking to my friend, which I later found out was

54:24.480 --> 54:27.400
a mistake because I had never played these MMO games before.

54:27.400 --> 54:30.200
So all I could do was walk around asking people, hey, how do you battle?

54:30.200 --> 54:32.480
Or do you know how to get money?

54:32.480 --> 54:37.800
And my normal response would be, no, go away you noob, you suck at this game, screw off,

54:37.800 --> 54:39.320
and ah ha ha ha, yeah right noob.

54:39.320 --> 54:42.920
No, yeah right what a noob, which didn't help me at all because I couldn't have any fun

54:42.920 --> 54:45.480
with this demo and made my gaming experience go down the drain.

54:45.480 --> 54:50.960
However, I remembered Sky on your show mentioned something about being a girl in World of Warcraft

54:50.960 --> 54:54.320
and how he got lots of items and stuff for free, so I decided to give it a try.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.840
I made a new account and made this girl human super hot with handlebars or pigtails or whatever

54:58.840 --> 55:00.760
you guys like to call them.

55:00.760 --> 55:05.120
And once I entered the world, it was entirely, hello, how's it going, oh wow, you're really

55:05.120 --> 55:06.120
hot, let's go out.

55:06.120 --> 55:09.820
And when I said, do you guys know how to battle, oh yeah, let's go, let me show you.

55:09.820 --> 55:12.840
Gomez responds, and the guy showed me where to go and everything even though I dished

55:12.840 --> 55:14.920
him once I got into the battling world.

55:14.920 --> 55:18.520
I am now given free money and items in this group because I just have to say my mic is

55:18.520 --> 55:21.120
broken so now I can just type everything I want to say to the players.

55:21.120 --> 55:24.880
I never knew until how many Desperate Gamer guys there really are out there.

55:24.880 --> 55:25.880
Sincerely, Gomez.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.680
I love this email.

55:27.680 --> 55:30.200
This email is fantastic.

55:30.200 --> 55:33.240
Because someone actually took a suggestion of mine and ran with it.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.240
You know what's funny?

55:34.240 --> 55:39.160
I'm not playing a girl in PSO because, you know, you may be new to the show so you may

55:39.160 --> 55:44.440
not have picked up on the fact that I'm a gamer who enjoys gamers of the male variety

55:44.440 --> 55:45.980
if you know what I mean, right?

55:45.980 --> 55:50.440
So I actually made a character who I would find attractive who is a male, like, you know,

55:50.440 --> 55:52.940
tall and handsome type guy, right?

55:52.940 --> 55:54.560
And that's the character I made.

55:54.560 --> 56:00.400
But the thing is that luckily I had the PSO experience so I kind of was able to pick up

56:00.400 --> 56:01.400
PSU pretty quickly.

56:01.400 --> 56:04.860
Yes, a lot's different, but I had my friends to voice chat with and kind of figure the

56:04.860 --> 56:05.860
things out.

56:05.860 --> 56:10.080
So what does it say about me always making short, cute girls?

56:10.080 --> 56:11.080
Nothing.

56:11.080 --> 56:14.360
Because you're a short, cute girl.

56:14.360 --> 56:23.640
And I have to say that the one male character I made back in PSO, though, was a femoral.

56:23.640 --> 56:28.440
Just be careful, though, because, you know, I do have a friend who is, like, OMG a real

56:28.440 --> 56:32.140
female that plays Phantasy Star Universe who's been playing the beta and she has a female

56:32.140 --> 56:36.440
character in the game and people harass her on voice chat all the time.

56:36.440 --> 56:39.640
And not only that, like, I was partied with her, I saw this happen.

56:39.640 --> 56:43.600
Random guys will run up to her and do those little motions that'll make it look like they're

56:43.600 --> 56:47.860
eating her out or trying to sodomize her and, like, all this stuff.

56:47.860 --> 56:49.320
People are so stupid.

56:49.320 --> 56:53.320
I can't wait for this game to go pay so that all these people will have to, you know, if

56:53.320 --> 56:56.480
that's how they want to spend their $10 a month, then fine.

56:56.480 --> 57:00.560
But you know, at least we'll filter out a lot of the lame-os that are just playing this

57:00.560 --> 57:01.560
because it's free.

57:01.560 --> 57:02.560
This should have, like...

57:02.560 --> 57:08.360
Now, what I did mean to ask, though, you've still got your mags in that game, right?

57:08.360 --> 57:09.360
No.

57:09.360 --> 57:10.360
You kinda have.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.360
Damn!

57:11.360 --> 57:15.200
You have a house pet who apparently later can be an NPC that joins you, but it's a little

57:15.200 --> 57:16.200
different.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.200
And you feed it stuff kind of like you did the mags, but it's a little different.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.200
That annoys us too.

57:19.200 --> 57:21.760
Okay, I'm going back to PSO so I can use my oppa oppa.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.280
No, no, no, no, no.

57:23.280 --> 57:24.280
PSU is beautiful.

57:24.280 --> 57:26.320
I want my oppa oppa!

57:26.320 --> 57:29.560
The first time I dual-wielded sabers, I was like, oh god, I love this game.

57:29.560 --> 57:30.560
Oppa oppa.

57:30.560 --> 57:33.720
Unless I can make my pet an oppa oppa, then I'll be happy.

57:33.720 --> 57:34.720
Okay, last email.

57:34.720 --> 57:35.720
You can name it whatever you want.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.720
Mine's named nothing.

57:36.720 --> 57:37.720
I want mine to look like an oppa oppa.

57:37.720 --> 57:39.560
It kinda does, so name it oppa oppa.

57:39.560 --> 57:40.560
Okay.

57:40.560 --> 57:41.560
Email.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.560
Last email.

57:42.560 --> 57:43.560
This is from Mark.

57:43.560 --> 57:44.560
Hey guys.

57:44.560 --> 57:45.560
You know what?

57:45.560 --> 57:46.560
I think that that's sexist.

57:46.560 --> 57:47.560
Okay, I'm just kidding.

57:47.560 --> 57:48.560
Oh.

57:48.560 --> 57:49.560
I'm kidding.

57:49.560 --> 57:52.560
I thought that was the email.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.560
I was like, what?

57:54.560 --> 57:55.560
Explain yourself.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.840
I'm just curious as to why you released the podcast in two parts.

57:58.840 --> 58:02.540
Is it that you can't get it all edited by Monday, or is it that you hope to get people

58:02.540 --> 58:05.760
to listen to the live broadcast instead of having to wait for the two parts?

58:05.760 --> 58:08.880
To be honest, I will never listen to the live broadcast because I just don't have the time.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.640
I hope you guys can change this.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.240
Anyhow, great show as always.

58:12.240 --> 58:13.400
Thanks, Mark.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.400
Because we want to.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.400
Nana nana nana.

58:15.400 --> 58:16.400
Nana.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.400
No.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.540
We did it at first because we were a little afraid.

58:20.540 --> 58:25.080
We didn't know how the server would handle a two to three hour program being thrown out

58:25.080 --> 58:26.640
there all at once.

58:26.640 --> 58:30.080
So we thought by breaking it up into chunks, it wouldn't be so bad.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.600
On our old server, we used to have to worry about bandwidth a lot.

58:32.600 --> 58:35.320
On this one, we don't have to worry about that so much.

58:35.320 --> 58:39.040
Hugs and kisses to our webmaster, VX Jason XV, who makes all this shit happen behind

58:39.040 --> 58:43.280
the scenes.

58:43.280 --> 58:45.780
We split it up in the beginning, and that's just kind of worked for us.

58:45.780 --> 58:51.280
For us, it's a little harder to sit down and listen to this podcast.

58:51.280 --> 58:55.480
It looks like it's three hours long than it is to just get little bits and pieces twice

58:55.480 --> 58:56.480
a week.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.560
I don't know how we've looked at it.

58:57.560 --> 59:01.280
I have two words that explain it for me.

59:01.280 --> 59:03.280
Pee break.

59:03.280 --> 59:08.680
Hypothetically, we could, when we break the show, just put a little like...

59:08.680 --> 59:11.560
Bobby takes a break on his show, but he'll put a little noise in there.

59:11.560 --> 59:13.440
He'll edit out his break and put a little noise in there.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.840
Technically, we could do that, but I don't know.

59:15.840 --> 59:17.400
It's just kind of what's worked for us.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.120
We might change our minds later in the future.

59:19.120 --> 59:23.840
I don't know, but for right now, it's kind of what we're doing.

59:23.840 --> 59:26.160
Email us if you feel strongly one way or the other because I've heard from people that

59:26.160 --> 59:29.160
kind of like the fact that they get regular OLR content.

59:29.160 --> 59:30.160
You won't this week.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.640
There is no second part this week, but a lot of folks like their regular OLR.

59:33.640 --> 59:35.040
We're irregular this week.

59:35.040 --> 59:36.320
Yes, that's right.

59:36.320 --> 59:37.320
We're pregnant.

59:37.320 --> 59:39.440
Is that it for emails?

59:39.440 --> 59:42.280
Just because someone's pregnant doesn't mean that they have irregularity.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.280
I'm just messing.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
God.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.280
It just means they don't need enough fiber.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.280
I'm just messing.

59:46.280 --> 59:47.280
Jeez.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.280
I'm getting all angsty.

59:48.280 --> 59:51.540
I already did the FUs of the week lately.

59:51.540 --> 59:54.160
You're catching me midweek after I got off of work.

59:54.160 --> 59:55.160
Any more mailbag?

59:55.160 --> 59:56.160
No.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.320
Send us more mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.000
Give this woman more to read next week.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.280
Any more stuff and give me money.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.320
Anyways, there was an unconfirmed rumor this week, as every other week, that there may

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:15.800
be a Blue Dragon anime series in the works.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:25.440
This is basically coming from a toy hobby figurine page from a Japanese toy company.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:37.320
It wouldn't be that far of a stretch because it is created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:49.440
the brainchild of Final Fantasy, and Dragon Ball Dragon Quest creator Akira Toyayama.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.400
Very strong ties to anime.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.200
They'd be kind of neat.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.600
But he also did all of the character designs for Chrono Trigger.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.160
You said Akira Toyama, right?

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.160
Yes.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.160
Okay.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.000
Yeah, he did all the character designs for Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.080
There has been short anime series for each, or segments of anime.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.080
They have existed in anime form.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080
Doesn't matter.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.400
They have existed in anime form at some point.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:26.720
So I guess we'll have to see because right now it's just rumor.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.120
If Microsoft can have their Viva Pinata show here, why can't they have a Blue Dragon anime

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120
there?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120
I'd rather have Blue Dragon.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.560
Viva Pinata sucks.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.200
I watched the thing on Xbox.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.200
It wasn't the end of the world.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200
It is!

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.200
Horrible!

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.200
Horrible!

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.640
It was bad, but if I was seven years old, I'd probably like it.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.880
Anyway, if I was seven years old, I might enjoy Bubble Bobble.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.880
No, I'm kidding.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.540
Actually, you can love Bubble Bobble no matter what your age.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.840
It is a very cute game, though, aimed at children.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840
But guess what, kids?

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.560
Don't buy your kids Bubble Bobble Revolution on the DS or they're going to be pissed off

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.880
because apparently this game was not play-tested past level 30.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.960
In other words, the game is supposed to have a boss show up at level 30, and the boss does

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.120
not show up, therefore rendering the game unplayable.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.120
Every time.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.880
A quote from the source, we have been looking very hard into this issue with Nintendo and

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.840
have now determined that all of the cartridges that have been shipped in North America are

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840
faulty.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.560
Needless to say, we are extremely sorry that this situation has arisen and would like to

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.400
apologize to you for this issue.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.800
We have already started the process whereby a corrected version is to be manufactured

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.240
and will ensure that all customers have their copies replaced.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.120
Unfortunately, this will take 8 to 10 weeks simply because of the time required to manufacture

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.200
new carts.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.360
We will update you with what you will need to do to get a replacement game as soon as

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.840
this has been determined.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.200
Hey, folks, over there at Taito making this game.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.120
How about you tell us a little bit about what you're going to do for your QA processes in

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120
the future?

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.240
Is it only the US one?

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.440
I'm not sure.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.760
I think it's the only region this has been released in so far.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.760
Has it?

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.760
I thought that it was a...

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.760
Maybe.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.760
Maybe.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760
It's the only place with a problem showing up.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.760
Well, you know what?

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.960
Apparently, they were too busy playing Rainbow Islands, which also, you know, was released

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.920
the same time instead of Bubble Bobble.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.720
I mean, words cannot express what a fuck up this is on Taito's part.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720
I mean, it's...

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.120
So, nobody ever played through the whole game over in their testing.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.560
You could use cheat codes to get through, I don't know, but somehow, some way, this

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:36.240
really, really big flaw was overlooked.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:40.400
It will make me hesitate every time I go to buy a Taito game on the DS from this point

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.560
forward, until they say what they're going to do to make it better.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.760
I guess, but then again, you know, perhaps they've learned their lesson, so to speak,

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.560
so I don't know, who knows, maybe their QA will get a lot better real fast after this

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.720
very embarrassing screw up, but not good, folks.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
Not good.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.800
Yeah, DMN says in our chat room, someone's getting fucking fired.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.360
Well, I'm going to raise a good point, Squeenix owns Taito now.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.440
Oh great, maybe Final Fantasy XII will be unplayable.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.080
I doubt that, though.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:22.200
There's lots of things to doubt, though, whenever anything that's involving them is, you know,

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.800
coming about, but never mind, I'm not going to be bitter.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.520
Not going to be bitter.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:34.400
Anyway, speaking of releases and things, we have some stuff from THQ for launch week for

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.040
the Wii 4 games.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.800
The first, of course, this is the big one, is Kars, for all of our Pixar fans, one of

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.840
who has landed in San Jose today, who I'm probably going to be hearing about this all

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.840
weekend.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840
We know.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
We all know.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840
What?

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840
I'm just messing.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.680
Oh no, no, I'm going to be hearing about it all weekend.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:04.160
Anyway, also coming out is Barnyard, Avatar the Last Airbender, and SpongeBob SquarePants

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.120
Creature from the Krusty Krab.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.200
So this just confirms Loki's list from previously, in other words?

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.200
Yeah.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.520
I don't remember the Barnyard title, but then again, I wouldn't have remembered that.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.680
It's been there, and it's just like, and you know, it's just so exciting because these

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.160
are all GameCube ports of like previous months.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.320
She could have said three games are coming out for the Wii, whoop-dee and shit, and it

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.960
would have had the exact same impact for me.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.160
I'm just sorry, not interested in any of these titles.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.160
You know what's really sad?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160
I guess Kars might be cubed.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.080
Some of these games that I thought were new are not new, like for example, GT from Ubisoft

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.200
is apparently a port of GT for the GameCube that came out a long time ago, and same with

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.600
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, it's a port of an Xbox game that came out a while ago too.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.320
Or I think it may have been a GameCube game at one time too, but I know the Xbox version

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:56.040
came out in April, and so they're nothing new, it's just a lot of ports, and I actually

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.000
cancelled my pre-order for GT because of that, so I'm like, I'm not going to buy any fucking

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.040
ports no matter how cool that little steering wheel might be.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.600
You can buy the steering wheel if you really want it.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.600
They are selling it separately.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.520
Use it on an Excite truck, which apparently has no online play.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520
That's very disappointing.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.520
Rob.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.520
Rob.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.520
Rob.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Rob.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.520
Rob.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.520
Rob.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.520
Rob.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520
Rob.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.520
Rob.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.520
No.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.660
The chat room made me!

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:24.820
Don't even think about it.

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.600
The chat room made me.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.040
Rob.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.160
What?

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.780
Low key, please save this show from going down the toilet anymore.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.080
Sorry.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080
We're stuck in the U-Bend.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:42.300
Anyways, so crappy Wii games, hooray.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:51.580
Some things that are not so crappy, though, and quite fun, actually, Mario Kart GP 2 is

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.580
coming to an arcade.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.580
That's the arcade one, right?

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.580
Yeah.

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.580
Hot!

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.300
Yeah, that's the game that I played while I was drunk on my bachelor party.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.620
Why isn't that video on YouTube?

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.300
Uh, because I haven't loaded it on there yet.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.740
We're going to let that happen.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:13.540
But basically, the game itself looks very similar to what we've seen before, although

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:18.460
I do see some things, though, that look new, like some of the characters...

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.580
I don't know who this is, and I don't know if you would know, Rob, but this character

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.820
looks very, very familiar.

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.820
Let's see here.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:27.820
I think...

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.180
No, this is from Tomogachi or whatever, I think.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.180
That character right there.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.580
Yeah, that looks like a Tomogachi corner shop.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:39.380
So that's going to be one of the brand new characters, a Tomogachi character, and then

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:48.580
it looks like you've got all your repeat characters, Wario, Mario, Luigi, Waluigi, Yoshi, Princess

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:57.560
Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and then the ghosts, Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.560
Very interesting.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.300
There's, of course, a lot more stuff that you can put on your character or your screen

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.300
caps.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:05.300
You know how they do the webcam thing?

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:09.140
Yeah, it's just my little finger up and put the princess hair over it.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:13.180
That's why we got to put my video on YouTube because my screen cap was hilarious when I

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.180
was drunk.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.820
We'll work on that, folks.

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:23.400
If you're too poor to purchase a Mario Kart GP machine, perhaps you're also too poor to

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.340
buy a Wii, even though there's a huge difference in price.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.340
I don't know.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.820
That's a good question I can think of.

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:33.560
If you are too poor to pick up a Nintendo Wii, you might get a chance at Toys R Us.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.180
They're doing a deal or no deal promotion.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.100
You get these things in the newspapers that are going to be coming out.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:44.580
They call them weekly circulars, and when you get one of these circulars, what you can

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:49.100
do is you can cut out the suitcases and you can take a deal, which is 10% off any item

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:53.420
in store, which I would think could be used on the Wii for a nice little saving, or no

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.420
deal.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:00.220
The cashier will scan the ticket and possibly you win a Wii console or you lose your 10%

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:03.020
coupon and get a 5% coupon instead.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.820
No word on the banker or a very scary looking Howie Mandel coming into play here, but supposedly

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:13.120
25,000 Wiis are being given away as well as a $1 million prize and a trip to Los Angeles

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:20.480
to go actually see the show live in person and be frightened by Howie Mandel in person.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.380
Good luck to any of our listeners that enter this.

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:28.660
I forgot to mention, since we don't have the video of my playing Mario Kart GP drunk on

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:34.140
YouTube, you can, however, download it for your PSP on OLRPSP.com under the download

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.140
section.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:40.340
I assure the listeners it will be on YouTube by the time you hear this show.

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.820
Look for username OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:49.900
Well, speaking of other amusing things, guess what Xbox is going to be, guess what Microsoft

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:53.020
is going to be doing?

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:57.180
Charging me more microtransactions for luminous backgrounds.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.300
Actually no, it's what they're already doing.

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:05.660
They're already in work on a successor to the Xbox 360.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:16.380
Basically Chris Lewis, who is the EMEA for Microsoft, their VP, sorry, has been quoted

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:21.460
saying you can't sit back on your laurels in this business, the consumer won't let you,

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:24.820
the developer certainly won't let us, so that's happening now.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:33.120
They said there's not anything they can really say on it right now, of course, but it's still

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.260
very, very early on.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.660
So they're thinking ahead.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:39.660
This isn't a surprise.

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:43.280
I mean, Xbox 360 was being worked on years in advance.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.340
Just because they're laying down the preliminary groundwork does not mean the 360 is dead.

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.340
By any means.

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.740
These things take years to happen.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.580
I think it's getting blown out of proportion a little bit by some of the gaming media out

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.180
there.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:11:01.340
Guess what, folks, Sony is probably working on a PlayStation 4 and Nintendo is doing a

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:06.140
Wii again or whatever they're going to call it, I mean, more Wii 2.

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.940
Who remembers the Neptune?

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.860
How long did that take to eventually become the Dreamcast?

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.100
Oh, the dolphin, huh?

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.100
Yeah, I gotcha.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.100
Alright.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:24.420
Yeah, hopefully they'll, you know, maybe they'll pick a cool development name and stick to

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:25.420
it.

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.820
Remember how disappointed people were when Nintendo dropped that name Revolution and

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.820
went with Wii?

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.340
Although I think people are used to it now.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.620
You know, I think people got the sand out of their vagina now over that whole naming

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.620
of the Wii.

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.620
I told you.

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.620
Revolution was a cool name.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:37.620
Wasn't I right?

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.620
Simplicity.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:39.620
Easy to remember.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:40.620
Something people will talk about.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.940
Well, we'll see when the damn thing goes on sale.

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:45.540
Besides, they need to save Revolution in case they come up with something really, really

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.180
cool like, you know, 3D holographic projection or something like that.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.180
They tried that.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.900
It was a game called Time Stalker.

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.100
Which was the big reveal on this show that Nintendo was supposedly putting in the Wii

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.100
console.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.940
Yeah, but you know what?

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:01.900
Somebody is still working on it apparently because that was still a quote that one of

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:07.220
the game companies out there had the technology to do it, so, you know, unless PlayStation

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:11.700
3 is doing that, which I don't think so, but, you know, whatever.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.180
I guess that would justify the cost.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:22.860
All right, well, when I said something about Microsoft charging on Xbox Live for little

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.100
bits and pieces here and there, I wasn't joking, folks.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.500
Now, to be fair, it's not really Microsoft that sets up these fees.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.500
It is the developers.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.220
Well, wait until you hear this one.

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:38.500
Electronic Arts is selling Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007 cheats on Xbox Live.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:44.540
In other words, you could just download for 200 points, unlock golfer, and unlock courses.

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.660
That's 200 each.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.460
And you will open up all the hidden golfers and courses in the game.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.220
Don't even have to think about, oh, I've got to play through and do this.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.260
I've got to play through and do that to unlock it.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.700
So you can still play through the game the old-fashioned way and not have to pay the

01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.700
points.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.820
But if you just want to unlock everything right at the start, just like that, pay 200

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.620
points for a simple unlock key.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.620
Good idea, bad idea.

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.620
Why?

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:17.180
Because it takes, why hands, actually it's more of a reflection on the society.

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:23.660
So I don't want to say necessarily bad idea, just a sad idea that people are so wanton

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:29.900
to instant gratification, wanton it now that they can't freaking work for something.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.420
That pisses me off.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.620
But Jamie, I have to have this course.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.540
My friends are coming over tonight for a Tiger Woods tournament.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.580
I have to play this course.

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.500
I suggest you start playing the hell out of it now.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.900
Sit your ass down in that chair and play your goddamn golf.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.580
Loki, any thoughts?

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:50.580
Good idea, bad idea.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:55.680
I think it's dumb just because, I mean, I guess whether they're trying to make sure

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.060
that when the next Tiger Woods game comes out, which is just going to have more courses

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:03.860
anyways and probably not be very different, that you'll be finished with this one because

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.460
you'll probably have already cheated by then or finished the game.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:11.180
Is this a way for them to say, F you, game facts, F you, strategy guides.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.100
Well, they tried the same thing before.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:19.820
They had EA put out Madden NFL tutorial videos for some of the basic stuff and they were

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:26.220
selling them online on Xbox Live Marketplace, stuff that should have probably been included

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.220
in the game, like how to throw a pass.

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.640
Yeah, that might be useful when I play the game.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:36.180
Jeremy Todd one in chat says, breaking news, they're going to add drivable golf carts in

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.220
Tiger Woods 2008 and you'll have to pay for the steering wheel so that you'll be able

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.660
to drive the golf cart.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.440
I would love to drive golf carts in Tiger Woods and run over people.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.300
That would sell the game for me.

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:55.260
All right, well, that's just about it for the gaming news tonight, but it's not it for

01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:59.460
everything we've got to say because you know Dark Soccer, she has to surf the web up and

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:05.140
down and left and right every single week and find a site for your viewing pleasure

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:08.420
and it's featured here in the website of the week.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:14.740
Dark Soccer, where should the kids be pointing their browsers right now?

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:21.060
I would suggest the site of false advertising, a gallery of parody.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:34.460
It's at parody.organiq.com and it's got lots of neat little false ads basically, you just

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:39.900
scroll through the site and it's basically like one of them is star sucks coffee, drink

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:46.620
our coffee or we'll break your legs and radio shit, you've got money, we've got pockets.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.660
So for those folks that like, you know, funny ha ha parody ads.

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:54.660
My favorite one on here is like the fourth one in, it's an ad for Prozac, it says you'd

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.100
kill them without it, it shows a picture of a family.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.340
Do they have a parody ad of the whole, you remember it was controversial about two months

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:04.540
ago, they had the white PSP ads, do we have any parodies of that?

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:09.620
No, I haven't seen any so far, I've seen Calvin Clone dare to be the same.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.700
Get working on that folks.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:17.060
And Baby Gasp, next week I'll outgrow this, it's pretty funny.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:21.820
Check it out boys and girls, Dark Soccer's website of the week.

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.900
One other thing we've been featuring here pretty weekly here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.340
are DDR previews.

01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:34.220
We've been previewing new tracks of DDR games upcoming on the Xbox and Xbox 360 systems

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:39.180
and guys you know what, next week is the last week for this, cry, sob, well that's right

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.860
the games will be out soon enough.

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.820
We still have more songs soon enough, well I guess after what you've learned tonight

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:50.700
maybe not that soon for Universe, but we do know that Ultramix 4 is coming, so at least

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.520
we can give you a little taste of what you can expect in March, that's alright, March

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.100
is a slow period anyway.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.100
Who releases games today?

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.100
March is actually pretty heavy.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.100
Is it?

01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.100
Yeah.

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.100
I thought it was April.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.100
April got heavier.

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.100
No, April starts to die down again.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.080
March is like the end of fiscal quarter months.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.140
Well then I obviously don't know what I'm talking about so let's get to the music.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:12.900
We have two new tracks tonight from DDR Ultramix 4 and two new tracks from DDR Universe, let's

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:17.180
start it off with a track from DDR Ultramix 4, no long versions tonight folks, sorry to

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:19.180
say, just have some short tracks for you guys.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:23.940
This first song is from DDR Ultramix 4, it's by a group called Neuroactive and the song

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:28.540
is called More Serotonin, enjoy it here on the sneak peaks.

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:58.060
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one.

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:21.740
Bye!

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:05.060
I was neuroactive with more serotonin here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:11.500
I caught myself doing the little head bob thing, Night at a Roxbury, during that song.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.260
For a dancy-trancy song, not bad.

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.260
I like that.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.660
This is a good edit.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:22.120
If dancy-trancy isn't your thing, remember that these games keep a variety of music.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.780
This one is definitely a unique sounding song, this next song we have coming up.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.780
It's very interesting.

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:28.780
It's interesting.

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:35.300
It looked like someone cut a really stinky fart.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.100
No, it's just different.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.820
It was not what I expected when I first heard this song.

01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:42.280
You guys see if maybe it's more your thing?

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:47.620
It's by Wave Group, featuring Scotty D. They did that Stompin' at the Gotham song last

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:50.500
week, which was awesome, that jazzy one we all liked.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.500
See if you like this one.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.780
It's called Bongo, here on the Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:55.780
Bongo.

01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.780
Hear that?

01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:05.900
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:13.900
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:36.700
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:57.900
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:22.860
It's one of the most exciting sounds in the world.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:36.380
Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peeks.

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:42.220
That is Bongo, by Wave Group, featuring Scotty D, coming soon to DDR Universe.

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.220
See what I'm telling you?

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.220
It's a little different.

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.220
That song is growing on me.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:50.300
I like the whole Austin Powers 60's spy theme vibe that song has going.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:54.060
I think, with all due respect to the folks that wrote that and sang it, I think it's

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.100
the voiceovers that kind of bugged me a little bit.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:57.100
I don't know.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:01.100
It's a little weird and out of place to me, but it'll probably be...

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:04.740
Songs sound different when you're just listening to them than when you do when you're actually

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.180
playing them and dancing to them when they're coming out of your TV, so I'm sure I won't

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.180
even notice.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.180
All right.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:13.840
Let's go to a song from DDR UltraMix 4, and this one's pretty exciting.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.540
This is by a group called Real Life.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.860
You might remember, years ago in the 80's, they did that song Send Me an Angel, and they

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.140
would still play it in clubs around the nation, right?

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:28.580
So they have a song in DDR UltraMix 4, it's called Oblivion, and it was remixed by Nevaraka,

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.460
who did some of the other remixes in previous UltraMix games.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:36.180
I didn't realize that they sung the original of that.

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:38.540
I have the Nevaraka mix, I just need to listen to the original.

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.540
There it is.

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:55.860
Real Life with Oblivion here on Orange Launch Radio, sneak peeks.

01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:17.700
We are in my heart, I am running out of the truth.

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:28.700
I'm running out of the truth Whatever I do I never want to hurt you

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:35.700
When it comes to this I feel fine but I have to admit

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:41.700
Here in my heart I'm running out of the truth

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:54.700
Life goes on and the world turns round Yeah, life goes on and the world turns round

01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:21.700
Cynthia, bring it on Cynthia, bring it on

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:34.700
I'm running out of the truth

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:59.700
I'm running out of the truth

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:04.700
Let's enjoy!

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:38.700
I'm running out of the truth

01:25:38.700 --> 01:26:07.700
I'm running out of the truth

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:31.700
