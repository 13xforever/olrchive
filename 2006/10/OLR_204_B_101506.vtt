00:00.000 --> 00:27.640
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 204 for this October the 15th of 2006.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.600
If this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget that Orange Lounge

00:30.600 --> 00:34.880
Radio is podcast twice a week, so you're actually listening to the second half of a show already

00:34.880 --> 00:35.880
in progress.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.200
If you want to catch the whole thing live when it broadcasts, you should listen to Orange

00:39.200 --> 00:44.080
Lounge Radio live on Sunday nights, or there's always our rebroadcast that plays on all games

00:44.080 --> 00:49.240
radio Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

00:49.240 --> 00:55.260
Speaking of all games radio, our buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show over there Sunday

00:55.260 --> 00:59.520
nights as well just before we do, he's going to be doing some type of trivia contest at

00:59.520 --> 01:04.640
the big video games expo, which I wish I was going, but sadly I'm not.

01:04.640 --> 01:10.000
The VG Expo, if you're within traveling distance, unfortunately, when I talk about going now

01:10.000 --> 01:12.760
we're talking about a plane ticket, but for those of you on the East Coast, it's probably

01:12.760 --> 01:15.640
very drivable from lots of different spots on the East Coast.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.640
Check it out.

01:16.640 --> 01:23.080
Valley Forge Convention Center right outside Philly, October 27th through the 29th, VGExpo.com.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.880
Bobby wanted me to point out, for those of you that went to Digital Life, this is only

01:25.880 --> 01:30.080
a couple hours from New York, and this is nothing but games at this show, so check it

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
out.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.800
Bobby's going to be doing some game show hosting, which I'm a little bit jealous because I like

01:34.800 --> 01:41.200
hosting game shows, but sadly no con has asked us to do a game show yet, oh well.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
Such is life.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
Yes.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
Back to games.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
Exactly.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.240
Well, such is life that we would have more news about Halo 3 at some point, and at some

01:50.240 --> 01:51.640
point it's going to be Halloween.

01:51.640 --> 02:00.720
Yes, the spooky holiday will feature some brand new news about Halo 3, and yeah, that's

02:00.720 --> 02:03.880
about all we know is that there's going to be news.

02:03.880 --> 02:11.040
It's news about upcoming news, and Halo 3 is coming soon.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.440
That's going to be the big news.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.600
Do you think, as we theorized previously, because you know you have that whole report

02:16.600 --> 02:21.620
talking about Halo 3 is likely to be coming out in April or May, do you think this could

02:21.620 --> 02:23.520
be where they drop that bombshell?

02:23.520 --> 02:25.620
Could this be the big bombshell that's coming out?

02:25.620 --> 02:29.200
It would be aptly timed, but probably not.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.840
Do you think it's more something along the notion of gameplay?

02:32.840 --> 02:38.680
You know this is time, though, to take a little bit of Sony's thunder from PlayStation 3,

02:38.680 --> 02:43.640
to get people talking about Halo 3 amongst the PlayStation 3 and Wii chaos that's sure

02:43.640 --> 02:44.640
to be going on in November.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.600
Well, I guess currently right now they're showing Halo 3 to a select group of magazine

02:48.600 --> 02:56.880
journalists, not websites, but a handful of magazine folks, and yeah, it looks like they're

02:56.880 --> 03:02.760
going to be having some sort of an event, and they're inviting game journalists from

03:02.760 --> 03:09.160
the U.S. and Europe to visit their studio and show a quick single player demo.

03:09.160 --> 03:15.160
All right, well, you know, I would say go out and buy the magazine to see the news,

03:15.160 --> 03:18.160
but it's going to be all over the Internet the day it comes out anyway, probably before

03:18.160 --> 03:24.280
it lands in your mailbox, so just read the Internet.

03:24.280 --> 03:31.080
Speaking of things that are at least being said around the Internet and other places,

03:31.080 --> 03:32.080
Sony's talking some crap.

03:32.080 --> 03:45.080
Actually, to be specific, that would be Nobuyuki Ide, who was the former CEO of Sony.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.920
He's actually their current chief corporate advisor, so when he was asked about the Xbox

03:49.920 --> 03:56.200
360 beating the PS3 to market, he said Microsoft is not a technology company.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.320
No, they make lunchboxes.

03:59.320 --> 04:08.480
Well, and Nintendo makes cards, at least they used to back in the day, but, you know.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.840
Yeah, they made Hanafuda cards.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.120
Does it used to run brothels, too?

04:12.120 --> 04:15.960
I really don't know.

04:15.960 --> 04:22.480
I just think that that's funny, because this guy was responsible for a lot of damage to

04:22.480 --> 04:28.800
Sony's profits back in the day.

04:28.800 --> 04:34.040
I think that it would be in Sony's best interest right now not to be throwing mud.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.040
That's what I would be doing.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.040
You know, concentrate on getting your console out instead of saying, our console is better

04:39.040 --> 04:43.800
than your console, except our console is not out yet, and yours is.

04:43.800 --> 04:49.200
Well, Sony pisses me off even more, because they're discontinuing the iBo.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.200
I love the iBo.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.920
Yeah, but the iBo is useless.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.120
The iBo is their little robot dog.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.800
I think that if they're going to do anything, they should make the iBo a peripheral for

04:57.800 --> 04:58.800
the PS3.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.800
That would sell more units.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.240
Oh, yeah, I think that might actually happen.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.360
That might sell me one.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
I'd buy one.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
That's just what I need.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.360
My PlayStation 3 to bark at me and play Blu-rays.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.000
Brilliant idea, Jamie.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.320
After all, I mean, after looking at the iAdjudgment setup that they have at G, I think I'd rather

05:18.320 --> 05:20.480
have a barking PlayStation 3 in that iAdjudgment.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.480
No, no, no.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
It wouldn't bark.

05:22.480 --> 05:28.280
It would hook up to the PS3, and instead of having Nintendogs, you'd have a real dog sim

05:28.280 --> 05:29.600
because you'd have your robot dog.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.240
So it's like Rob the Robot.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.040
But only good for more than one game.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.680
This is why you're on Internet radio, Jamie, and not in a boardroom.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.680
You know what?

05:40.680 --> 05:42.720
My idea is with some money.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
People should hire me.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.160
They need to create Rob the Robot.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.360
I always wanted a miniature version of it for the DS or something like that, that would

05:50.360 --> 05:54.680
sit next to your DS and do the same little thing and just re-release Gyromite or something

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
like that.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.680
I think that'd be fun.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.440
Well, actually, one of the good things about the iBo is it actually was a very inexpensive,

06:00.440 --> 06:07.120
pretty, you know, interestingly complex AI in the little system that you could afford

06:07.120 --> 06:13.080
better than a human-sized robot, and a lot of AI developers and robotics experts were

06:13.080 --> 06:15.440
actually buying iBos for experiments.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.800
Drunami in our chat room is suggesting that here on Orangetown's radio, we could replace

06:18.800 --> 06:20.800
Loki with an iBo.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
That would be cute.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
That would be pretty fun.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.800
I bet the iBo is a lot cuter.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.800
iBos are really cute.

06:25.800 --> 06:32.440
It'd go well with my new Mac when I get it.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.800
Speaking of Sony, before Loki has a chance to give a counter argument there, speaking

06:35.800 --> 06:40.160
about Sony executives who are sitting in boardrooms eating crayons all day when they ought to

06:40.160 --> 06:47.000
be working, this executive, Michael Ephraim from Sony of Australia, you know, he made

06:47.000 --> 06:51.880
this crazy comment earlier in the week that was essentially insinuating that the Wii and

06:51.880 --> 06:56.200
the 360 were too pricey.

06:56.200 --> 07:02.320
The maker of the most expensive console for the next gen says the Wii and the 360 are

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
too pricey.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Okay, whatever.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.600
Well, he further clarified his statements later in the week, but this is what he said,

07:07.600 --> 07:12.020
quote, sorry you didn't have the opportunity to buy a PlayStation 3 this year, but I'm

07:12.020 --> 07:16.240
sure it beats lining up in a queue for hours on end only to be told the store has sold

07:16.240 --> 07:17.240
out.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.240
Okay.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.600
No doubt in response to the delays over in Europe and some of the other countries.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.240
So yeah, too bad you didn't have that opportunity to do that now.

07:25.240 --> 07:30.100
Don't worry, your opportunity is coming soon.

07:30.100 --> 07:36.080
This just goes, look, again, I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is going to be a just fine system.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.240
Give it a little, it's like a fine wine, it will age just fine.

07:39.240 --> 07:44.840
But Sony executives, seriously, gag order, seriously Sony, if you're listening, you

07:44.840 --> 07:51.200
need all these people to STFU, you need to get a public figure that is not going to be

07:51.200 --> 07:58.040
a laughing stock of the internet such as Reggie Miyamoto over there or Major Nelson, Peter

07:58.040 --> 08:03.280
Moore over here, Sony needs somebody like that.

08:03.280 --> 08:09.760
And I'll tell you what, it's not this guy, it's not Kaz, giant enemy crab guy, who as

08:09.760 --> 08:13.440
I hear has suffered so much embarrassment from that, he doesn't do public appearances

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
anymore.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.360
I feel bad for him almost in a way, his boss has probably made him do that, and Kaz.

08:18.360 --> 08:23.200
Oh, I'm sure they leave giant enemy crabs at his desk and stuff like that.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.000
You know that game is just never going to come out now, or if it does come out, that

08:27.000 --> 08:29.120
will be on the big sticker.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.800
It should be one of those things like the movie Showgirls, where at this point it should

08:32.800 --> 08:38.440
just be self-aware of the joke that it is now and just market itself as, hey, we're

08:38.440 --> 08:40.760
that historically accurate game with the crabs.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.880
That would be funny though.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.720
Maybe they could just say the game caught crabs.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.140
He goes to his doctor for a physical, I've got bad news for you.

08:48.140 --> 08:51.720
You have giant enemy crabs, poor guy.

08:51.720 --> 08:56.560
Anyways, yeah, but as if it wasn't bad enough, you know, that Sony is opening their mouth

08:56.560 --> 09:01.640
and getting themselves in trouble, now of course they're receiving flak from the most

09:01.640 --> 09:07.160
likely of places, a Microsoft blogger, whoo, anyways.

09:07.160 --> 09:13.640
But this apparent Microsoft blogger was talking about their PS3 online service and saying

09:13.640 --> 09:18.840
that, well, it seems to be a mishmash of online accounts, logins, services, for example, now

09:18.840 --> 09:24.360
when I play a PS3 title, I simply can't depend on having a single friends list, Sony will

09:24.360 --> 09:30.120
manage the master list, which should have presence in every PS3 title, and XFire will

09:30.120 --> 09:34.120
be a plugin that some publishers integrate into some games, and some won't.

09:34.120 --> 09:38.240
That means gamers can't depend on finding their friends in one place.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.840
And he goes on talking about more other stuff and talking about how XFire is going to cost

09:42.840 --> 09:46.360
money because they're, you know, licensing it and stuff, and what's that going to do

09:46.360 --> 09:49.520
with the whole service and the fact that we haven't really heard much about, you know,

09:49.520 --> 09:54.560
their online service and, yeah, so who knows.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.920
So some fair, equal time type stories here.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.440
Microsoft's doing some of the smack talking too.

10:00.440 --> 10:05.180
Maybe should be leaving the PR to folks like Major Nelson and maybe some of the underground

10:05.180 --> 10:10.800
communities, the huge Xbox fan communities out there, some of our other friendly podcasts

10:10.800 --> 10:13.480
such as Gamertag and XBL, you know.

10:13.480 --> 10:18.280
But there is some other interesting stuff though, and this is funny because as soon

10:18.280 --> 10:26.840
as they, you know, ran this, that of course someone had to come to Sony's defense, and

10:26.840 --> 10:27.840
that they did.

10:27.840 --> 10:33.600
And actually, they were talking about, you know, some of the information and they also

10:33.600 --> 10:40.800
posted it in their blog saying there's some bad information, you know, there responding

10:40.800 --> 10:42.200
to the blog post.

10:42.200 --> 10:48.040
That I'll get to in a sec, but it was interesting to me because it highlights some pretty core

10:48.040 --> 10:52.120
differences in the approach that the PlayStation folks have taken and just kind of talking

10:52.120 --> 10:56.760
about how, you know, the XFire friends list is not a replacement for the PS3 friends list

10:56.760 --> 11:04.960
and that it's, you know, I don't know, it's basically Sony's, some guy named Smed.

11:04.960 --> 11:14.960
All right, yeah, so very interesting, yeah, their online president, Smed.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
Okay.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.720
Welcome to Sony, eat this crayon.

11:18.720 --> 11:24.120
All right, look, let's go from all these smack talking executives to you guys smack talking

11:24.120 --> 11:25.720
us in our mailbag.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.280
No, just kidding, we haven't gotten a lot of hate mail recently, have we?

11:28.280 --> 11:29.280
Not really.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.280
Oh, that's good, that's good.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.120
I'm glad you guys have been nice and polite, we appreciate that.

11:33.120 --> 11:37.040
You can send us an email, it's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com and every week Dark

11:37.040 --> 11:42.400
Sakura suits up with her rubber gloves and his besto suit and digs in there and tries

11:42.400 --> 11:46.800
to avoid the anthrax and the flames from the hate mail, of which we haven't gotten much

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
lately.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.440
Actually, I did get anthrax lately, but it was with Public Enemy bringing the noise.

11:50.440 --> 11:54.400
I see, but me saying, you know, we haven't gotten hate mail, you know, that just encouraged

11:54.400 --> 11:57.480
like five pieces of hate mail for this week, so that should be fun.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.440
We like getting the hate mail, it's fun to read.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.400
Sometimes it's amusing for five seconds.

12:01.400 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, so anyway, let's read some of our email, shall we Dark Sakura?

12:05.000 --> 12:09.600
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, send us more.

12:09.600 --> 12:18.800
Well, the first email actually comes from Orko4, basically saying that in Hickory, North

12:18.800 --> 12:24.720
Carolina there was a restaurant called Tallywhacker's, me bringing up how they should make peckers

12:24.720 --> 12:28.960
as a thing to hooters, and that the owner wanted the waiters to be shirtless and wearing

12:28.960 --> 12:34.080
speedos but they couldn't for help violations, so they wore, you know, really tight ass shorts

12:34.080 --> 12:35.080
and tank tops.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.760
Oh yeah, I remember you talking about the mail hooters a couple weeks ago.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.280
They went out of business.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.880
I wonder why.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.600
And the last line says, keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear the Doctor Who

12:43.600 --> 12:44.600
website of the week.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.040
Well, it's not Doctor Who this week, so ugh.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.040
It's Torchwood.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.040
That's a spin-off.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.560
I see.

12:52.560 --> 13:00.280
Next comes from Mike, hey, the other day I saw a Nintendo presentation on game trailers.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.040
Is that how it really started off, hey!

13:02.040 --> 13:03.040
It said hey.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.480
It said suddenly it's that little fairy that follows you in The Legend of Zelda, wasn't

13:06.480 --> 13:07.480
it, Natty?

13:07.480 --> 13:08.480
Hey, listen!

13:08.480 --> 13:09.480
Hey, listen!

13:09.480 --> 13:13.480
That's how I want you all to open up your emails from now on.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.480
Hey, listen!

13:15.480 --> 13:22.240
Anyway, to continue, it says that the price points for the Virtual Console 500, 700, and

13:22.240 --> 13:26.320
1000 points are actually awarded as starting at points.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.000
So does this mean that we could be paying $15 for a Nintendo 64 game?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Just wanted to hear your thoughts.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Possibly.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
We'll see.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.120
I went through behind him.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.960
You know what I was just thinking about, though?

13:38.960 --> 13:44.240
If Ocarina of Time does come to Virtual Console, why would I get that?

13:44.240 --> 13:47.520
Because I have the little GameCube disc that had it on there, so.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.400
Yeah, that was a limited release, so.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
Yeah, whatever.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.640
I thought the Nintendo 64 was going to be $10.

13:53.640 --> 14:01.240
I thought it was $5 for NES, $8 for Super Nintendo, $10 for Nintendo 64.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.240
Yeah.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.240
Oh.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.240
Okay.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.240
Another email from Michael.

14:05.240 --> 14:10.520
It says, hey, Skyloki and DarkSakura and maybe Drudami, who is not here tonight.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.520
He's in our chat.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.520
Stop that.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.520
Stop what?

14:13.520 --> 14:20.640
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.320
Rob, only you can see this.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.760
Oh, look, you can see it, too.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.760
But it's aimed toward you.

14:24.760 --> 14:25.760
I see.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.760
Thank you.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
Is that your IQ?

14:27.760 --> 14:28.760
One?

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
No.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
Mail?

14:30.760 --> 14:31.760
Email?

14:31.760 --> 14:34.160
First off, I'd like to say that I love your show.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.160
Thank you.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.480
And I've been listening on the podcast stream for a year and a few months, and I most recently

14:39.480 --> 14:41.240
listened live last week.

14:41.240 --> 14:50.200
Speaking of which, I was the one who called in and hung up Tassete Purim, I guess I said

14:50.200 --> 14:51.200
that.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.200
I think it's Latin.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.200
I didn't take Latin.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.200
Sorry.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.800
I think he's actually renamed himself in chat to just call me Mike.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.200
So we'll call him Mike.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
Hi, Mike.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
Sorry about that.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.840
I forgot to mute the live stream while using Skype.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
Oops.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.800
Anyway, earlier on Xbox, what's up with me?

15:05.800 --> 15:08.840
On episode 203, sports games came up.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.600
Most of the hosts on OLR aren't sports games fans.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.000
You said that sports games are just a roster update.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.280
Well, the same can be said about music games.

15:16.280 --> 15:21.080
Sure, games like DDR have a few very marginal new innovations, but for the most part, the

15:21.080 --> 15:23.480
games are just the same damn thing with new music.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.720
And to some idiotic gamers, they just hear weird Japanese techno and they think it's

15:26.720 --> 15:31.120
the same damn thing with the same music and a new number after the title.

15:31.120 --> 15:35.400
While I disagree with both arguments, I think that both make a valid point.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.880
So here's my call to the game developers and producers.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.840
Don't make a new game until it's ready.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.080
Sure, your game can have all the songs or players in the world, but don't put it out

15:44.080 --> 15:47.560
until it is better than its predecessor.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.800
That's exactly what they're doing at 3D Realms.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
What?

15:52.800 --> 15:56.280
It took Nukem forever.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.100
They're making sure that it's ready.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.100
Is email done?

16:00.100 --> 16:01.100
No.

16:01.100 --> 16:02.100
Okay.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.420
Because I want to say something, but go ahead.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.460
This goes for all games, not just music or sports games.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.600
Take the Halo franchise, for example.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.860
Halo 1, a masterpiece.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.800
Halo 2, an Unreal Tournament skin.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.240
Don't get me wrong, I play Halo 2 almost exclusively.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.600
Halo 2 was pushed out the door too quickly and just for live experience.

16:17.600 --> 16:22.220
Halo 2 was an unsatisfying game that could have been even better than the original.

16:22.220 --> 16:25.560
Then the master of re-releasing a game, whether it needs to be or not.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.560
Metal Slug.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.600
I love Metal Slug.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
It rocks.

16:28.600 --> 16:32.080
But when it's been pushed toward me on every available medium with no new features, it

16:32.080 --> 16:35.280
makes me never want to buy a Metal Slug game again, even if it has every feature in the

16:35.280 --> 16:36.280
world.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.880
I love Metal Slug.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.920
Anyway.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.600
Game developers need to realize something.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.120
Sure, you release the sequel to a good game, it sells well.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.140
But what if you want to make it a trilogy?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.500
Is it accepted?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.820
Or is it looked on as milking the franchise?

16:51.820 --> 16:57.240
It makes sense in the short term, but in one of the worst options in the long run.

16:57.240 --> 17:03.600
Soon gamers will get smart and realize they are being scammed by buying the same game

17:03.600 --> 17:05.000
every year.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.520
I've been trying to tell this to anyone who will listen, sadly I think it's too late.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.640
PS, sorry if I'm sending you this email again, it's to the first one.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.440
Oh, yeah, I didn't get the first one, sorry.

17:14.440 --> 17:20.720
Okay, I thought it was a pretty clever comparison, the whole roster update versus the music games,

17:20.720 --> 17:25.000
but I think for that it really depends on what you're into.

17:25.000 --> 17:31.200
I don't hate sports games, I just recognize that that's not what I'm into, you know?

17:31.200 --> 17:37.080
And I'm sure for most of them, maybe dance games isn't really what they're into, and

17:37.080 --> 17:42.160
so they wouldn't recognize the fact that the new dance games do go through interface upgrades

17:42.160 --> 17:47.160
and usually there's a new mode in them somewhere, and certainly the entire list of songs gets

17:47.160 --> 17:52.080
refreshed with, in the beginning there were quite a few carryovers, but in the more recent

17:52.080 --> 17:55.120
mixes, there's been very few carryovers, and so on and so on.

17:55.120 --> 18:00.760
I'm not going to bore you to death with the comparisons, but it's an interesting analogy,

18:00.760 --> 18:06.200
but I think us being fans of dance games, we don't see that, you or other sports games

18:06.200 --> 18:12.360
fans being fans of sports games, you don't see that either, that the rest of us just

18:12.360 --> 18:13.720
see the roster update or whatever.

18:13.720 --> 18:17.540
Well, actually I think it's exactly the same thing, the fact that neither of the games

18:17.540 --> 18:24.520
have huge improvements, granted sports games go through graphical improvements and roster

18:24.520 --> 18:30.340
updates, but this is even coming from people reviewing the brand new EA lineup or whatever

18:30.340 --> 18:34.340
that they aren't really adding anything new and it really just is a roster update.

18:34.340 --> 18:41.100
But that's something that they need to improve in both dance games and sports games and probably

18:41.100 --> 18:50.960
a lot of other games, like God of War 2, that looks like an update to God of War 1, a lot

18:50.960 --> 18:53.360
of games are like that nowadays.

18:53.360 --> 18:57.280
Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room has an interesting point, roster updates don't really change

18:57.280 --> 18:58.920
the gameplay all too much.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.760
New music and music games do change gameplay a bit.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.380
You have to learn new steps and that sort to the new songs.

19:05.380 --> 19:12.460
You don't really change much for roster updates, but even the sports games do get some new

19:12.460 --> 19:17.700
modes for their respective games just once in a while, just like the dance games.

19:17.700 --> 19:22.400
For instance, we know that in the new Xbox ones we're going to have the non-stop mixes,

19:22.400 --> 19:23.400
things like that.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
Alright, that's my thoughts.

19:25.400 --> 19:33.080
Well, we also got another email from Rini and it's a fairly long one, so just to sort

19:33.080 --> 19:41.200
of paraphrase of it, it's going into more innovation in the DDR series of games, but

19:41.200 --> 19:42.200
I'm going to start from here.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.680
Actually, I want to read the first one just because it was really nice.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.920
Good day to OLR and happy belated episode 203.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.320
May you have another 396 more at this point and beyond.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.320
That was really sweet, thank you.

19:54.320 --> 19:59.280
So to continue on toward the middle part of this letter, there was some discussion going

19:59.280 --> 20:04.360
on in the Air and in Japan and DDR UK forums that was started to see what users had in

20:04.360 --> 20:08.360
mind for some realistic and reasonable feature additions that could be added to DDR.

20:08.360 --> 20:13.000
I'll try to make things brisk with a few suggestions made by the community.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.900
Preview background mode and steps at the song wheel and maybe at the modifier screen.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.640
Challenge steps for every song in the sense that they would not only give something for

20:20.640 --> 20:25.200
expert players, but would also bring out the full potential of the song according to Konami

20:25.200 --> 20:30.140
so that we don't have the boring as hell licenses from the arcade supernova that has gaps of

20:30.140 --> 20:32.440
nothing for no reason.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.920
Wave break 0.25 and half speed, why hasn't Konami put these in?

20:36.920 --> 20:41.320
If UltraMix 3 allows 0.5 speed and Phantom modifiers, then why can't the PS2 versions

20:41.320 --> 20:42.920
have them?

20:42.920 --> 20:49.060
Custom courses set on a home version can be used at the arcade with the ability to include

20:49.060 --> 20:51.760
any song available on the arcade machine.

20:51.760 --> 20:55.200
Also should have a maximum of four songs on nonstop mode and allow modifiers and a max

20:55.200 --> 20:59.640
of five songs on challenge mode that disallows modifiers for these courses.

20:59.640 --> 21:04.560
Trade edit data online and at the arcade, submit arcade score data online through a

21:04.560 --> 21:07.440
home version by way of memory card.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.320
Those are some good suggestions.

21:11.320 --> 21:15.200
They are good suggestions and certainly we've thought through the show, many years we've

21:15.200 --> 21:19.840
been doing the show, a lot of you guys when you've called in said very similar things.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.640
Keep in mind that another thing that maybe goes along with the last email, the whole

21:23.640 --> 21:27.080
roster updates, something Konami seems to be doing with the DDR is that they really

21:27.080 --> 21:30.040
try to make each one its own separate thing.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.800
The Xbox DDRs and the PlayStation 2 DDRs are really separate, they're their own different

21:34.800 --> 21:35.800
things.

21:35.800 --> 21:40.000
It's interesting to see where the arcade versions fit in now with the whole...

21:40.000 --> 21:46.520
I think Supernova for me feels more like a, is there a market for DDR again?

21:46.520 --> 21:47.520
I don't know.

21:47.520 --> 21:51.560
If Supernova is successful, I would think that maybe we're going to get another arcade

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
release.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
I don't know.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.560
I think either way it's inevitable.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.800
We're going to see Supernova 2 or something like that next year because with the leftover

21:57.800 --> 22:01.200
songs that you didn't get from the arcade this year at least, but we'll see.

22:01.200 --> 22:06.680
I am going to put this one up on our site, but there is though a last paragraph on here.

22:06.680 --> 22:13.820
By the way, the emails that I post are going to be on the live show discussion area on

22:13.820 --> 22:14.820
our forums.

22:14.820 --> 22:18.920
It says Implayboy can just get the fuck out with their pathetic excuse of a video game

22:18.920 --> 22:19.920
related centerfold.

22:19.920 --> 22:25.280
All the artistic offerings out there read hentai, beat the shit they have easily and

22:25.280 --> 22:28.440
for free, although it is commendable that they get CG nudity, right?

22:28.440 --> 22:29.440
P.S.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.440
More goddamn ferret.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.920
I actually heard that the CG nudity on it looked pretty crappy.

22:33.920 --> 22:38.160
I did look at the final thing, well the final one that was post-ed, censored of course.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.520
It wasn't that great.

22:41.520 --> 22:49.560
Well it's Fake Boobs Implayboy, which is kind of a, you know, it's like money at the bank.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.560
Exactly.

22:50.560 --> 22:55.080
Well, to continue, the next one comes from JeremyTod1.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.240
First off, you probably already got a couple of emails on the subject and probably aren't

22:58.240 --> 23:00.920
even going to talk about it on the show, but here's my email.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.280
O.L.R.'s enemy, G4, is finally mostly gone.

23:04.280 --> 23:10.280
Yes, I know the words G4 are banned from O.L.R., but for now we might not need to talk about

23:10.280 --> 23:14.400
them much anymore.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.520
This is all I'm going to say on this because you're right, those words are banned from

23:18.520 --> 23:22.160
this network.

23:22.160 --> 23:26.680
I think a lot of people are saying it's definitely the doom and gloom of the network.

23:26.680 --> 23:31.400
I think it's more the doom and gloom of the network as a gaming network because it's being

23:31.400 --> 23:36.520
merged in with E-Networks, which also runs like the Style Channel and some other channels.

23:36.520 --> 23:41.080
That doesn't mean the station's gone or merged into E yet, although I think that may be a

23:41.080 --> 23:43.760
foregone conclusion that happens in the future.

23:43.760 --> 23:49.840
But don't expect any gaming content outside of X-Play, but this is not news again.

23:49.840 --> 23:54.000
That channel has not been a gaming channel for the past 18 months.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.380
Where have you been?

23:55.380 --> 23:57.720
This is still not news.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.720
So what?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.260
They're doing a corporate restructuring around there.

24:00.260 --> 24:01.880
It's not going to save them.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.760
Flush that shit down the toilet and be done with it.

24:04.760 --> 24:08.240
There is a quote on here, though, that I knew it from the get-go.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.940
I do agree with the vision.

24:09.940 --> 24:16.800
This is actually a quote from the Ian-style chief, Ted Harbert.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.960
I do agree with the vision of going after young men more than going after gaming.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.600
Gaming has been demonstrated as being too narrow.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.600
Narrow my ass!

24:25.600 --> 24:29.080
There are a lot of gamers out there.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.480
Text email, please.

24:32.480 --> 24:36.840
No offense to the men listening and the men in the room, but stupid men.

24:36.840 --> 24:37.840
Anyway.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.840
Well.

24:38.840 --> 24:39.920
I didn't mean you guys.

24:39.920 --> 24:44.920
You guys are fairly liberated in your mental states, and so are our listeners.

24:44.920 --> 24:45.920
Kisses.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.920
Is that all the email?

24:46.920 --> 24:47.920
No!

24:47.920 --> 24:48.920
Well, then get to the next one.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
We're out of time here.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
Yeah, my voice is running out.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.840
Hey, O-L-R. This, by the way, comes from Kenji.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.600
So I just picked up Clubhouse Games for the DS, and I cannot emphasize this enough.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.680
It is definitely a must-buy if you've got to hook up to the Wi-Fi connection.

25:03.680 --> 25:09.020
Even though the bowling physics are awful, you can't go all-in, and you can bet yourself

25:09.020 --> 25:10.960
out of a negative chip score.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.080
Playing nine-ball is similar to playing the game underwater or in space.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.080
Take your pick.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.240
You can't deny the infinite replayability of this game.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.860
Also, you can pick to chat via Wi-Fi.

25:19.860 --> 25:23.120
It can only be, however, on matches with your friends, and, of course, you can pick to via

25:23.120 --> 25:26.560
local wireless play and chat with your present messages on WorldFi Wi-Fi.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.400
So DMN lied to us last week?

25:28.400 --> 25:31.480
Of course, he had the game before most people.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.320
He had the game before most people, so he probably didn't have friends on Wi-Fi yet,

25:34.320 --> 25:35.320
so that makes sense.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.320
That makes me want to buy the game, though.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.320
Why?

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
Dirty Wi-Fi.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.320
Dirty Wi-Fi chat?

25:40.320 --> 25:41.320
Yeah.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.320
That would be fun.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.960
Anyway, it is because of the awesomeness of this game that I come to you with a request,

25:45.960 --> 25:46.960
nay, a favor.

25:46.960 --> 25:51.120
I wanted to make an OLR Clubhouse games night where we all exchange friend codes, make a

25:51.120 --> 25:53.720
date and time, and basically play the night away.

25:53.720 --> 25:58.080
Perhaps you'd all like to participate, you being Jamie, Sky, and Loki, and you also being

25:58.080 --> 26:00.120
the rest of the people listening.

26:00.120 --> 26:06.000
At long last, pick to chatting, drop 4 biatch can become a reality, but only with your help.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.880
I've left a post in the forums for anyone who's interested, as I always love the show.

26:08.880 --> 26:09.880
Kenji?

26:09.880 --> 26:12.920
Just so you know, I did see that post earlier in the week, and I actually just moved it

26:12.920 --> 26:17.080
to the OL Army forums because it's kind of fit a little more with that because we try

26:17.080 --> 26:21.760
to create teams in certain games that will follow the cardinal rule of the OL Army is

26:21.760 --> 26:23.320
don't be a dick.

26:23.320 --> 26:27.000
So we just want people to join up that just want to have fun and not try to have that

26:27.000 --> 26:31.080
elitist attitude or like, you know, my plus four sword can be your plus two, you know,

26:31.080 --> 26:32.080
who cares?

26:32.080 --> 26:33.080
Get in the game and have fun with it.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.600
Put your plus four sword in your pants.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
That's exactly right.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.120
So I actually moved that post over to the OL Army and I posted my code there.

26:39.120 --> 26:44.480
So if you want to add that would be cool and certainly we could set up a night for gaming.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.880
Maybe it could be a tie in with one of the live shows that we do during the week because

26:47.880 --> 26:50.880
a lot of people don't know there's shows we do on Orange Launch Radio, but we don't podcast

26:50.880 --> 26:53.300
because, you know, we like to be a live radio network.

26:53.300 --> 26:57.960
So Dark Sakura has her thing on Tuesdays and I have a show on Wednesdays and there may

26:57.960 --> 26:59.800
be more shows coming soon.

26:59.800 --> 27:03.620
We know Loki's got something in the works and there's something else I'm trying to get

27:03.620 --> 27:04.620
on board.

27:04.620 --> 27:05.620
We'll see.

27:05.620 --> 27:09.800
We're coming from GS 191, we got a really long email, but I thought it was very cool

27:09.800 --> 27:14.920
and have posted it on that thread that I mentioned prior on there.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.120
So I'd love to get some discussion started up on that.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.120
I will.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.800
The other emails that I was going to post up to will be coming.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.480
It's just been, like I said, I've had a sinus infection the last week, so I haven't really

27:24.480 --> 27:25.480
done much of anything.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.480
Excuses, excuses.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
I'm kidding.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.960
Would you like the sinus infection?

27:28.960 --> 27:29.960
Not really.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.260
I would love to see you on erythromycin.

27:32.260 --> 27:33.260
Not really.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.260
Okay.

27:34.260 --> 27:35.780
Not erythromycin.

27:35.780 --> 27:39.080
Just a, you know, he who shall not be named.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.080
Anything else for emails?

27:40.080 --> 27:41.080
Yes.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.120
God damn, we got a lot of emails this week.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.120
They love us.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.120
One more.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.120
Last email.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.120
We got to keep moving.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.120
Yes.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.120
This is the one that came on through MySpace.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.120
Ah, okay.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
Yes.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.120
I remember this one.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.120
This is a MySpace message.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.120
Gally from Breakdown Radio.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.120
Mm-hmm.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.120
Hey guys, Gally here from the Breakdown.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.600
I'm a big fan of the show and you guys rock swords big time.

27:58.600 --> 28:02.260
Sorry I didn't send this to your mailbag, but I think being yelled at by the boss right

28:02.260 --> 28:03.600
now, damn the man.

28:03.600 --> 28:08.160
Anyway, with all this talk of the Wii 60 going down, do you guys think it's a smart move

28:08.160 --> 28:09.160
on a personal level?

28:09.160 --> 28:13.180
Do you guys already have 360s, but try and look at it from the perspective of a gamer

28:13.180 --> 28:14.960
who has neither yet?

28:14.960 --> 28:19.800
Do you think it would be a wise move to do the Wii 60, stick with one of the two, or

28:19.800 --> 28:24.200
is the last alternative, which I highly doubt because of Sakura's crayon eating references,

28:24.200 --> 28:25.360
holding out for the PS3?

28:25.360 --> 28:29.520
It seems a lot of gamers out there face that dilemma and we've been thinking this question

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
a lot from our listeners.

28:30.520 --> 28:34.000
I'm sorry, we've been getting this question a lot from our listeners and peers.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.640
So what do you think?

28:36.640 --> 28:40.840
Okay, DarkSakura, please remind our listeners of the golden rule of gaming.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.520
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

28:43.520 --> 28:49.400
Yes, and this is why I have her bring this up because it's really about what you want

28:49.400 --> 28:52.160
out of this next generation of gaming.

28:52.160 --> 28:56.860
If you're rich and are really into gaming and want to buy all three systems, hey, go

28:56.860 --> 28:57.860
for it.

28:57.860 --> 28:58.860
Get them all.

28:58.860 --> 29:03.780
But if you are not rich and you only have the choice, you know, do I want to get a PS3

29:03.780 --> 29:07.960
or do I want to do the Wii 60 thing, or hell, can I really only pick one of these?

29:07.960 --> 29:12.240
You know, you really have to consider what games do you want to play.

29:12.240 --> 29:17.960
And I think especially right now between Wii and Xbox 360, there's vastly different games

29:17.960 --> 29:22.060
available on the two systems, so you really have to ask yourself, am I wanting to do the

29:22.060 --> 29:29.200
wavy controller, Elibits, Zelda, WarioWare type of game, or do I want to get online and

29:29.200 --> 29:35.720
play Gears of War and soon Halo 3 and maybe some, you know, games like Enchanted Arms

29:35.720 --> 29:39.820
or NFL NBA type games that are available on Xbox 360?

29:39.820 --> 29:41.800
You really have to consider.

29:41.800 --> 29:45.320
And then the way PlayStation 3 works into it is that, you know, even though a lot of

29:45.320 --> 29:50.000
games that, you know, we're hearing are kind of the same things we saw on Xbox 360, i.e.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.640
Oblivion and so on, they are going to have their own games eventually that stand out.

29:56.640 --> 30:00.600
My personal mindset is that you don't need to get a PlayStation 3 right out the gate,

30:00.600 --> 30:06.960
but I say that because for me, there's no games on this yet that I have to have.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.700
A year from now, I'm probably going to feel a lot differently.

30:09.700 --> 30:13.600
By the time Final Fantasy 13, Metal Gear Solid 4 start hitting the market, you know what,

30:13.600 --> 30:15.840
I'm probably going to be Sony fanboy all over again.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.500
But as far as the launch goes, I'm not really sold.

30:18.500 --> 30:22.780
So if you think you're going to have some money now and then more money in a year and

30:22.780 --> 30:26.500
PlayStation 3 doesn't have the lineup for you right now, do what I'm doing.

30:26.500 --> 30:30.880
Buy the Wii now so you have your Wii 6, because I bought the Xbox 360, you know, six months

30:30.880 --> 30:34.240
ago so, you know, it's spaced out enough where this isn't a huge financial impact.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.320
Buy the Wii when it comes out and then buy the PlayStation 3 later down the line.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.960
But, you know, again, it's up to you and what games you want to play.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.840
And there's no real clear answer we can give.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.920
We can only tell you based on what we play.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.780
But there's going to be Sony fanboys that say, no, you have to have one of these on

30:46.780 --> 30:53.240
launch because you have to have Lair and Warhawk and Sixaxis for life and yadda, yadda, yadda.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.680
But it's all about what you want.

30:54.680 --> 31:01.360
Well, from my perspective, I'm getting them all anyway, so...

31:01.360 --> 31:03.320
I'd say if you can get them all, get them all.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.560
That way you're not limited.

31:06.560 --> 31:10.080
ActDeaf says, I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'll get a 360 just to play

31:10.080 --> 31:11.940
UNO.

31:11.940 --> 31:15.200
You might be being sarcastic, but you're really wasting your time if that's all you want because

31:15.200 --> 31:19.480
you can play it for free on Zone MSN, or, hell, Clubhouse Games has something just like

31:19.480 --> 31:20.480
it.

31:20.480 --> 31:25.600
So, if now you must have strip UNO with the webcam, well, I suppose a 360 is the only

31:25.600 --> 31:27.600
place you could do that.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
I don't know.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.960
Rama says PlayStation 3 will be bringing it back to the store after it breaks in 20 minutes.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.520
Hey, you know what?

31:33.520 --> 31:34.880
That's something to be said too.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.360
Maybe you don't want to get a first generation worth of console.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.320
I learned my lesson with the Xbox 360.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.840
Go back and listen to some episodes around February when I bought my Xbox 360.

31:42.840 --> 31:47.280
The damn thing broke when I bought it, and I was pissed, and I was going to go torch

31:47.280 --> 31:52.200
down Microsoft, but since then they fixed it for free, and I've been a happy boy.

31:52.200 --> 31:58.560
I did also want to make an announcement, though, for Pump Up the Volume, actually, this week.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.560
Your Tuesday show.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.560
Yes.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.560
Yes.

32:01.560 --> 32:02.560
Excuse me.

32:02.560 --> 32:03.560
There will be a delay on the show.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.680
It will be starting around 730 to 8 this week.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.320
I just wanted to go ahead and make a mention of that.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.840
I am doing it.

32:10.840 --> 32:11.840
All right.

32:11.840 --> 32:15.080
Let's go ahead and listen to the other live programming on Orange Launch Radio.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.800
All done with the mailbag?

32:18.800 --> 32:19.800
Yeah.

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
Okay.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.240
Moving on to more gaming news.

32:23.240 --> 32:28.960
There is a movie called 8-Bit under development.

32:28.960 --> 32:33.840
According to VH1's Game Break, quote, this movie is about how games affect our culture,

32:33.840 --> 32:37.820
how the genre crosses the culture to influence music, art, and the way we think.

32:37.820 --> 32:42.160
In 8-Bit, artists invade the online shooter Counter-Strike to add messages of peace on

32:42.160 --> 32:45.580
walls with paintball guns if they don't get shot first.

32:45.580 --> 32:50.640
In 8-Bit, people make compelling trance club and even pop-focus music using old Game Boys.

32:50.640 --> 32:55.200
In 8-Bit, artists Mary Flanagan's take the software from Unreal Tournament 2003 to make

32:55.200 --> 33:00.560
Domestik, a memorous world in which she tells a story about how her father was trapped in

33:00.560 --> 33:02.320
the family's house during a fire.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.400
It's amazing stuff all the way around.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.400
Huh.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.400
Sounds kind of artsy.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.920
That might be interesting.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.480
It's kind of weird that I've never heard of any of this stuff.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.140
Well, I mean, I've heard of the music, certainly.

33:13.140 --> 33:16.040
We know a lot of those bands, but I haven't heard of any of those other art projects,

33:16.040 --> 33:17.200
so that might be worth checking out.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.200
I've heard of the Game Boy one.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.200
Really?

33:19.200 --> 33:20.200
Well, yeah, yeah.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.200
The Game Boy music one.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.200
Yeah.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.200
We've also had bands that use the type of...

33:24.200 --> 33:25.200
Yeah.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.680
I'm talking about like the Counter-Strike, Grandpa and the fire thing and the whole...

33:28.680 --> 33:29.680
Those sort of things.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.680
I've never heard of that before.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.440
That might be interesting.

33:32.440 --> 33:39.320
Bringing paintballs into a wall does not make for a winning team, but it's an interesting

33:39.320 --> 33:42.160
kind of art form when it's done in a game, huh?

33:42.160 --> 33:43.160
Maybe?

33:43.160 --> 33:44.160
Yeah.

33:44.160 --> 33:49.040
It's very unique, but it's also kind of neat, and one of the rumors that's going to be coming

33:49.040 --> 33:54.960
soon, and you might actually be able to watch 8-bit on this, that Microsoft might be adding

33:54.960 --> 34:00.040
XVID and DivX support to the 360 in the fall dashboard update.

34:00.040 --> 34:08.680
Now, no idea whether it's true or not, but the news actually comes from a developers

34:08.680 --> 34:13.720
conference that was going on, actually.

34:13.720 --> 34:23.920
Some Dutch colleagues from xLife.nl were invited to a training session for shop employees and

34:23.920 --> 34:28.920
basically kind of just talking a little bit about technology and stuff.

34:28.920 --> 34:34.200
One of the questions that was asked, basically at the event, they had a talk with the host

34:34.200 --> 34:39.000
and asked them whether it was going to be DivX or XVID support in the future or other

34:39.000 --> 34:43.160
codecs, and he said that it was something that Microsoft was working hard to implement,

34:43.160 --> 34:48.320
and a firmware update is expected within two months.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
We'll have to see.

34:49.320 --> 34:54.360
That might be a rumor for now, but it would make sense if they supported something like

34:54.360 --> 34:55.360
that.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.100
I don't know if they will, though.

34:57.100 --> 35:04.400
Something that's not a rumor is a new multiplayer mode for Red Steel is going to be called Killer

35:04.400 --> 35:05.400
Mode.

35:05.400 --> 35:12.320
It's a special multiplayer setup, so you'll use your mission brief via the speaker and

35:12.320 --> 35:13.320
the Wiimote.

35:13.320 --> 35:21.360
I was hearing something about this, that basically, I think the Wiimote is supposed to ring, and

35:21.360 --> 35:25.160
so you put it up to your ear and it'll actually whisper like, you know...

35:25.160 --> 35:26.160
This is Snake.

35:26.160 --> 35:30.640
This isn't like, you need to kill player four and do not kill the other players or something

35:30.640 --> 35:31.640
like that.

35:31.640 --> 35:34.520
It gives you your mission in a little speaker so the other people don't know what your mission

35:34.520 --> 35:35.520
is.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
That's pretty cool.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.520
That is damn innovative, isn't it?

35:37.520 --> 35:38.520
That's pretty fun.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.520
I like that.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.520
That is pretty cool.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.520
That's innovation.

35:41.520 --> 35:45.100
I like that.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.960
This might be innovative as well for the Wii.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.140
The Wii might just be this system of innovation.

35:49.140 --> 35:55.020
That's certainly the direction that Nintendo wanted to go in, whether the public is open

35:55.020 --> 35:56.240
to that or not.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.440
I'm not quite sure.

35:58.440 --> 36:06.920
The rumor is that a Wii is going to go into digital distribution in 2007.

36:06.920 --> 36:10.520
What they're actually doing, they're talking about service, I think it's going to be very

36:10.520 --> 36:15.840
similar to Xbox Live Arcade, and they kind of touched on this a little bit during E3,

36:15.840 --> 36:24.640
saying that they're going to be helping finance certain smaller games for the Wii marketplace.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.040
This I think is going to be very similar to that.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.920
They're going to be talking a little bit more about releasing games.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.880
You see some of the stuff, not necessarily old games on Xbox Live Arcade, but newer games

36:34.880 --> 36:37.520
that are small made for that kind of setup.

36:37.520 --> 36:42.760
I don't see this really replacing the current distribution we have now, but it's interesting

36:42.760 --> 36:47.160
because you've heard a lot of talk about this whole digital distribution moving on into

36:47.160 --> 36:50.440
the next gaming area, especially on PlayStation 3 as well.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.440
There's a quote here.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.840
Let me read this real fast.

36:52.840 --> 36:56.600
This is from, I believe this is from Nintendo themselves.

36:56.600 --> 37:01.060
Beginning in spring 2007, Nintendo will apparently begin the Wii Compact software line of games

37:01.060 --> 37:05.600
which will allow players to download certain Wii titles to their console rather than purchasing

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
a disc.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.120
Pricing and storage details as well as what software will be made available, not provided.

37:10.120 --> 37:14.140
Yeah, it's going to be very interesting on the storage details because it doesn't really

37:14.140 --> 37:18.040
have much storage in that system, only 512.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.840
I'm sure there will be an external.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.120
If there's a peripheral to be made, Nintendo's on it.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.120
Definitely.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.880
It was actually kind of interesting.

37:25.880 --> 37:29.880
They had some pics from the new peripherals that were announced for Japan, and we got

37:29.880 --> 37:33.640
to see a picture of the Ethernet adapter for the Wii.

37:33.640 --> 37:40.040
It's just USB Ethernet, which is kind of cool, and new cables and whatnot.

37:40.040 --> 37:46.080
So, anyways, there's some interesting stuff also coming out about the Wii, and I know

37:46.080 --> 37:50.600
one of the stories that was run during the week when talking about how sunlight was causing

37:50.600 --> 37:56.320
a problem with the Wiim remotes, where it was interfering with the IR field that the

37:56.320 --> 38:01.040
actual receiver and emitters were putting out.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.640
Well, apparently, Nintendo has commented on that, and they said that it's not a major

38:05.640 --> 38:06.640
issue.

38:06.640 --> 38:10.040
It says, our testing thus far shows no great risk of light interference while playing a

38:10.040 --> 38:13.580
game that relies on the pointer and sensor bar.

38:13.580 --> 38:19.600
And so, granted, that's going to be about as much interference as having a bright light

38:19.600 --> 38:24.840
shining on your TV or something like that, that won't really interfere with it.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.280
I'm kind of on the fence with this.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.400
I guess we'll have to see when it comes out.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.400
But you know what, though?

38:30.400 --> 38:37.000
If there's anything to be learned from this, especially from the iToy and from the Xbox

38:37.000 --> 38:42.080
Live Vision camera, my house is always too dark, so I don't think too much light is ever

38:42.080 --> 38:44.080
going to be a problem.

39:12.080 --> 39:17.160
She serves the internet up and down and left and right, and finds a website that she finds

39:17.160 --> 39:19.360
worthy of sharing with you all.

39:19.360 --> 39:23.880
It's called her Website of the Week, and here it is.

39:23.880 --> 39:29.760
This Website of the Week was actually one given to me by our dear friend and listener,

39:29.760 --> 39:34.360
Rob with Two Bees, and I'll spell it out.

39:34.360 --> 39:42.200
It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com, which is for the Entertainment Consumers Association, which

39:42.200 --> 39:44.000
is actually very cool.

39:44.000 --> 39:49.480
To read this little blurb from their website, the Entertainment Consumers Association is

39:49.480 --> 39:53.800
a non-profit membership organization established to serve the needs of those who play computer

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
and video games.

39:55.800 --> 40:02.520
Formed in 2006, the ECA is an advocacy organization for consumers of interactive entertainment.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.080
You can actually sign up for their site.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.160
They have things to win.

40:05.160 --> 40:09.680
They also have lots of information, links to game politics, too.

40:09.680 --> 40:14.080
It seems that there's a little bit of an affiliation there.

40:14.080 --> 40:19.480
Lots of really good stuff, FAQs, news, just things that are going on as far as our legal

40:19.480 --> 40:20.800
rights as gamers.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.960
In fact, there's another blurb on here.

40:23.960 --> 40:28.120
It says, today more than ever before, gamers need to stand together to defend against political

40:28.120 --> 40:32.780
activity that is threatening the creation and publishing of video games.

40:32.780 --> 40:37.500
On behalf of the gaming community, the ECA lobbies legislators directly as well as launching

40:37.500 --> 40:41.160
grassroots digital initiatives to preserve our rights as gamers.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.160
What was that link again?

40:43.160 --> 40:47.900
It's T-H-E-E-C-A dot com.

40:47.900 --> 40:48.900
Check it out, boys and girls.

40:48.900 --> 40:49.900
Definitely.

40:49.900 --> 40:53.560
I'll be linking it in the chat room.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.480
GameTap is a service we've mentioned a few times on this show.

40:56.480 --> 41:00.880
It's still getting a little steam, a few more subscribers every now and then.

41:00.880 --> 41:07.120
They have launched a 500 player beta of Uru Live, which you might know also as the missed

41:07.120 --> 41:08.800
online project.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.680
This is a pretty big deal because what happened is the project was abandoned and then GameTap

41:12.680 --> 41:16.680
has kind of picked it up and ran with it, so it's kind of interesting.

41:16.680 --> 41:21.440
Gay Gamer recently ran a report on this and they said this, quote, GameTap has improved

41:21.440 --> 41:25.000
the game with new sound support and a new physics engine that makes it much easier and

41:25.000 --> 41:28.880
faster to interact with others, something that bogged down the original game.

41:28.880 --> 41:33.480
As things go as planned, Uru Live may begin to incorporate content generated by its incredibly

41:33.480 --> 41:35.080
creative player community.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.080
Interesting.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.080
That's pretty cool.

41:37.080 --> 41:41.640
I hope they keep doing more stuff like that, supporting smaller games, maybe helping some

41:41.640 --> 41:43.520
PC games get published and stuff like that.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.720
I think what's kind of neat about that, too, is that you're paying essentially the GameTap

41:46.720 --> 41:50.120
fee for access to all this, so if they get more MMOs, it's kind of like you're paying

41:50.120 --> 41:54.320
one fee for all these MMOs, and GameTap is relatively cheap.

41:54.320 --> 41:58.160
It's the same price they're charging for Phantasy Star Universe, in a way.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.600
I don't want to sound like a commercial because I've already been accused of being on their

42:00.600 --> 42:01.600
payroll.

42:01.600 --> 42:07.840
No, I actually pay the $10 a month for GameTap, which is sad because I rarely ever use it

42:07.840 --> 42:13.540
because I check it out once every other week or so to see what's new.

42:13.540 --> 42:15.640
This is something I definitely will check out.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.640
I'm very curious.

42:16.640 --> 42:21.600
Obviously, I can't get it in the beta, but when it's released.

42:21.600 --> 42:28.500
This week, Unfettered Blather, a blogging site, actually ran a top ten list of the top

42:28.500 --> 42:33.800
ten things about next-gen that are annoying.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.840
Let's go off the list here.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.040
Big highlights, of course.

42:37.040 --> 42:40.200
Number one, Sony's alternate reality.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.520
No matter how you spin it, we just want a game console first.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.300
Go push your format war somewhere else.

42:46.300 --> 42:50.080
Number two, dual-price skew nonsense with the new next-gen console.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.580
You know what, though?

42:51.580 --> 42:55.120
If you read those stories about people who are pre-ordering the PS3, some of them were

42:55.120 --> 42:57.040
doing it because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.

42:57.040 --> 43:00.560
I don't know if number one has as much validity as people think.

43:00.560 --> 43:01.560
I don't know.

43:01.560 --> 43:05.200
Anyways, cost between consoles and computers vanishing.

43:05.200 --> 43:10.200
$60 games, expensive peripherals, consoles being released at $600 price points.

43:10.200 --> 43:16.520
Chasing Nintendo, since you just can't ignore the changes in industry, but sure fun watching

43:16.520 --> 43:21.920
these two mega-corporations scramble to keep up with Nintendo's ideas.

43:21.920 --> 43:28.040
And other fun stuff, they're also on there, mainly repeating the $60 game thing and name

43:28.040 --> 43:32.120
changes like they're saying the revolution was a better name and stuff like that.

43:32.120 --> 43:34.440
That $60 game thing should have been number one.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.500
That's the most annoying, if anything.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.500
Come on.

43:37.500 --> 43:38.500
$60 bucks.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.080
My game would have made my list.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.000
Yeah, we haven't really seen it.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.020
That whole Gran Turismo thing, though, I don't think we've really seen what exactly

43:45.020 --> 43:47.600
is going to come of that, you know what I mean?

43:47.600 --> 43:48.600
Interesting.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.600
All right.

43:49.600 --> 43:54.360
Well, if you have more annoying things, you could maybe write this guy and maybe he'll

43:54.360 --> 43:56.880
do an extended list in the future.

43:56.880 --> 44:03.840
Well, in other news, in regards to, we had brought up there was going to be a Castlevania

44:03.840 --> 44:05.840
movie, right?

44:05.840 --> 44:09.960
Well, it's going to be written by Warren Ellis.

44:09.960 --> 44:10.960
Pretty cool, huh?

44:10.960 --> 44:15.600
But also, it is going to be direct to DVD.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.640
I don't know.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.400
Direct to DVD, that's not good.

44:19.400 --> 44:22.080
There have been some good things put direct to DVD.

44:22.080 --> 44:24.680
Well, it kind of seems to be one place the movie industry is going.

44:24.680 --> 44:27.400
You have all these god-awful sequels going direct to DVD.

44:27.400 --> 44:33.440
Why not something kind of new, unique, unless you saw Van Helsing, which was kind of Castlevania

44:33.440 --> 44:35.200
the movie in a way.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.200
Not really.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.200
Just kidding.

44:37.200 --> 44:43.320
At any rate, there's a quote on here saying, for an entity currently known only as Project

44:43.320 --> 44:50.800
51 Productions, a production blog will follow on the official site.

44:50.800 --> 44:53.640
We just keep our eyes on it to see what happens.

44:53.640 --> 44:54.640
All right.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.360
Well, I'm looking for it.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.360
I'll rent it.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.760
I'll put it in my Netflix queue.

44:58.760 --> 45:02.480
Having him write it, that's like a fan-gasm right there.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.480
I don't know.

45:04.480 --> 45:08.520
By the way, it is the animated Castlevania thing that we were talking about before.

45:08.520 --> 45:13.220
So animated movie, that wouldn't be too bad, I guess, and this is not live action.

45:13.220 --> 45:14.880
After all, they are making BloodRayne 2.

45:14.880 --> 45:19.600
I mean, god, do we really need more video game movies like that, but I don't know.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.240
It should be pretty cool.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.720
Okay, here we go.

45:23.720 --> 45:27.520
He basically was a comic writer.

45:27.520 --> 45:31.440
I actually did remember that he did work for Excalibur because I read Excalibur from its

45:31.440 --> 45:39.440
beginning incarnation and on, did DV8, which was a Gen 13 spinoff, Stormwatch.

45:39.440 --> 45:45.960
The Authority did some stuff for Vertigo, Transmetropolitan was one.

45:45.960 --> 45:55.080
Also was working on the Counter-X line of titles for Marvel, as in Generation X, X-Man,

45:55.080 --> 46:04.960
X-Force, and is also working on Avatar comics, Homage comics, lots of different comic stuff.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.160
I just had to pull up the list.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.000
I knew Excalibur off the top of my head.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.880
Comic fan-gasm for those folks that are looking forward to the Castlevania movie.

46:11.880 --> 46:15.000
I always remembered the Excalibur stuff, but I knew he did a whole bunch of other things

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
too.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.720
Well, another animated thing that's very popular is South Park, and of course, a couple of

46:19.720 --> 46:21.320
weeks ago, they had the Wow episode.

46:21.320 --> 46:26.360
Well, man, you should have kept a tab on Wikipedia because people just started coming up with

46:26.360 --> 46:31.360
these huge lists of things that were inconsistent in the episode.

46:31.360 --> 46:35.160
I mean, obviously, these were the same guys that Matt and Trey were trying to make fun

46:35.160 --> 46:36.160
of.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.320
For instance, here's one.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.780
Trailers for this episode show Stan and Kyle in what appears to be the undercity right

46:41.780 --> 46:43.140
after Kenny is killed.

46:43.140 --> 46:44.840
In the airing of the show, they were in Goldshire.

46:44.840 --> 46:51.440
I mean, it's like, damn, people, get a life.

46:51.440 --> 46:55.220
But I do want to point out, I watched this week's episode of South Park, and for those

46:55.220 --> 46:59.480
folks that heard my review of the Wow episode of South Park last week, that satire I said

46:59.480 --> 47:01.720
was missing, that was in this week's episode.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.840
This week's episode of South Park was freaking hilarious.

47:03.840 --> 47:08.600
I laughed my ass off, but I just have a fucked-up sense of humor.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.600
What can I say?

47:09.600 --> 47:13.200
Don't you think that they probably did that stuff on purpose or just didn't really give

47:13.200 --> 47:14.200
a crap?

47:14.200 --> 47:15.200
That's what they did.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.200
Ah, bathroom.

47:16.200 --> 47:21.120
So then there's another wonderful rumor going around the interweb this week.

47:21.120 --> 47:26.520
That would be that the sword featured in the actual episode of South Park was a real sword.

47:26.520 --> 47:34.280
Sword of the 1000 Truths is supposed to be winnable in the arena matches in Burning Crusade.

47:34.280 --> 47:40.240
Some people think that it's an obvious Photoshop, but who knows, I guess we'll see when Burning

47:40.240 --> 47:43.440
Crusade hits stores.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.960
That's kind of interesting though.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.880
It actually wouldn't surprise me if that were true.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.720
I actually don't think that's a fanboy thing.

47:49.720 --> 47:53.960
I think that could actually be true because that episode of South Park felt like such

47:53.960 --> 47:58.000
this huge infomercial, it would be the perfect tie-in.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.520
Well it was funny though, because actually some of the stats were a little bit different

48:01.520 --> 48:05.400
from the actual cartoon.

48:05.400 --> 48:15.840
Of course it says 197 to 296 damage, 88 damage per second, plus 21 stamina, requires level

48:15.840 --> 48:16.840
70.

48:16.840 --> 48:21.520
It says equip improves hit rating by 8, improves critical strike rating by 14, and improves

48:21.520 --> 48:22.520
your resub.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.120
Why don't you go post that on Wikipedia, you damn nerd?

48:24.120 --> 48:26.120
It doesn't match what was in the show.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.000
No, they already posted that on Wikipedia.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.600
Oh, I see.

48:29.600 --> 48:34.920
So that would be interesting to see if that's going to actually be coming out.

48:34.920 --> 48:39.600
Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, looks like those wow nerds during the correcting needs a clue.

48:39.600 --> 48:40.600
I got a clue.

48:40.600 --> 48:41.600
I got a raging clue.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.880
My clue is over there.

48:42.880 --> 48:43.880
Let's go there.

48:43.880 --> 48:44.880
Oh my, ClueGoo.

48:44.880 --> 48:45.880
ClueGoo.

48:45.880 --> 48:46.880
That's a raging clue.

48:46.880 --> 48:47.880
I get it.

48:47.880 --> 48:50.320
It's a joke about the South Park from this week.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.320
That's funny.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.320
Good job, listeners.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.320
Good job.

48:53.320 --> 48:55.320
Geeky, geeky, geeky, geeky.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.240
Yeah, well, you know what?

48:57.240 --> 49:00.840
You are on an internet radio program about video games.

49:00.840 --> 49:01.840
Hi.

49:01.840 --> 49:02.840
Hi, you're black.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.560
Hey, hey, hey.

49:04.560 --> 49:07.280
I calls them as I sees them, dude.

49:07.280 --> 49:14.400
Well, you remember my allusion to the Phantom earlier in part A?

49:14.400 --> 49:15.400
Yes.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.400
Aha.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.400
Pay attention, listeners.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.320
Well, I was giving foreshadowing.

49:19.320 --> 49:20.320
Ooh.

49:20.320 --> 49:24.400
Yeah, they actually are starting to sell something for Phantom.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.760
Isn't that funny?

49:26.760 --> 49:31.280
They have been showing off this thing called the Phantom wireless lap board and Phantom

49:31.280 --> 49:34.320
wireless laser mouse.

49:34.320 --> 49:39.640
The two together are basically just a way to sit on your ass and browse the internet

49:39.640 --> 49:40.640
with a keyboard.

49:40.640 --> 49:48.320
It's like Web TV, only with a swivel keyboard thing and a piece of hard plastic underneath

49:48.320 --> 49:49.320
it.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.860
So is this the next generation of gaming?

49:50.860 --> 49:53.360
My ass.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.920
Like I said, Web TV, we've had this shit before.

49:56.920 --> 50:00.120
But I...

50:00.120 --> 50:01.120
Hard surface.

50:01.120 --> 50:02.120
Was that funny, Loki?

50:02.120 --> 50:03.120
No, I'm sorry.

50:03.120 --> 50:10.280
I was just reading our chat room, and Black Boy's like, I have a blue kettle.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.820
My kettle's silver.

50:11.820 --> 50:15.340
There was a comment made in chat room to what I had said earlier, and I asked Black Boy

50:15.340 --> 50:19.640
if his kettle was black, and he said it's actually blue.

50:19.640 --> 50:26.120
The Get Well Gamers Foundation, it's another nice charity that was posted about a little

50:26.120 --> 50:29.760
bit earlier this week on gaygamer.net.

50:29.760 --> 50:34.400
Our next step is to see that we have product donations to support our new increased capacity.

50:34.400 --> 50:38.760
At the moment, we have nowhere near what is required, but given our track record of success,

50:38.760 --> 50:41.080
we are confident that someone will answer the call.

50:41.080 --> 50:45.220
With the holidays fast approaching, however, it's crucial that we receive donations as

50:45.220 --> 50:46.760
soon as possible.

50:46.760 --> 50:48.880
Now what is it that they're donating to?

50:48.880 --> 50:54.040
Very similar to the whole Penny Arcade deal that they do, these guys help donate video

50:54.040 --> 50:57.160
games and game systems and things to children.

50:57.160 --> 50:59.420
So that's pretty cool.

50:59.420 --> 51:04.980
And this is a pretty cool thing, is that you can actually donate your old games, so games

51:04.980 --> 51:08.060
you might think are old and outdated and you're never going to play anymore, like instead

51:08.060 --> 51:13.080
of throwing a Nintendo 64 in the garbage, you could donate it to a charity like this.

51:13.080 --> 51:17.920
And listen, if you've watched, fucking, Mind Mancia, you would know that nobody wants

51:17.920 --> 51:19.520
a Nintendo 64 anymore.

51:19.520 --> 51:25.280
I would just like to point out, in this picture, on this site, there is a child, a sick child,

51:25.280 --> 51:26.440
you're playing a Nintendo 64.

51:26.440 --> 51:27.440
Hasn't he suffered enough?

51:27.440 --> 51:29.520
He suffered an heartless bastard.

51:29.520 --> 51:33.800
Hey, hey, I still love Pokemon Snap.

51:33.800 --> 51:34.800
Me too.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.320
And Mario 64 is the shit.

51:37.320 --> 51:39.440
I also threw away a PlayStation.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.440
Well, I've done that.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.560
I have a stack of five of them in my back room.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.040
You hurtless, both of you.

51:45.040 --> 51:46.040
They don't work.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.040
Oh, come on.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.040
If it's broken, then it's broken.

51:48.040 --> 51:54.880
One of our old ones, it will still sort of work, you have to tilt it sideways at a 45

51:54.880 --> 51:57.400
degree angle for it to read the discs right.

51:57.400 --> 51:58.400
Maybe I'll donate mine to this charity.

51:58.400 --> 52:00.400
I don't really play my Nintendo 64.

52:00.400 --> 52:04.080
My Nintendo 64 was broken, it was all blurry, and the polygons were simple.

52:04.080 --> 52:05.080
See, now you're making it up.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.080
Now you're just making stuff up.

52:07.080 --> 52:10.880
If I'm going to play Nintendo 64, I'll play my DS.

52:10.880 --> 52:11.880
Exactly.

52:11.880 --> 52:13.840
Anyway, just admit you're a bad person and get to the next story.

52:13.840 --> 52:17.400
I am a bad person, and I have no problem with that.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.800
You're a bad, bad man.

52:19.800 --> 52:25.160
Listen, if it comes, I'm getting my Wii, and I ain't donating shit.

52:25.160 --> 52:26.560
That's my Wii.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.560
You're going to-

52:27.560 --> 52:28.560
Whatever.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.560
I'm not going to say any more.

52:29.560 --> 52:30.560
Anyways-

52:30.560 --> 52:31.560
You're going to get cancer.

52:31.560 --> 52:32.560
That's just what's going to happen.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.560
It's karma.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.560
You're going to die in a fire.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.560
Well, they all have a Nintendo 64 again.

52:37.560 --> 52:38.560
The circle comes full.

52:38.560 --> 52:41.280
You know you really want a 64 double D?

52:41.280 --> 52:42.280
What?

52:42.280 --> 52:45.480
I think we really need to go to the next story at this point before we get this-

52:45.480 --> 52:50.560
Okay, look, we've got one foot in hell, so let's please go to the next story.

52:50.560 --> 52:55.360
Anyways, because in hell, if you throw water on the ground, you're going to get steam.

52:55.360 --> 52:56.360
That's my transition.

52:56.360 --> 53:01.320
Because steam is getting a lot more cool games coming to it.

53:01.320 --> 53:05.760
One of those games is a fan favorite, Psychonauts.

53:05.760 --> 53:10.420
That's kind of neat, and of course, other things that you're going to be seeing on steam

53:10.420 --> 53:17.120
other than Psychonauts, and Psychonauts, by the way, is just going to be about 20 bucks.

53:17.120 --> 53:21.520
You're also going to see such wonderful games like Call of Duty 2, as well as some other

53:21.520 --> 53:26.880
Activision titles, Call of Duty United Offensive, and Gun.

53:26.880 --> 53:30.360
Those are also going to be coming, as well as the brand new game that will also be coming

53:30.360 --> 53:38.120
to Xbox Live Arcade someday, RoboBlitz is also making its way, so lots of fun stuff

53:38.120 --> 53:39.120
for steam.

53:39.120 --> 53:43.240
They should do a game called Call of Booty.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.480
Or porn.

53:44.480 --> 53:47.920
You know, they have World of Porncraft.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.680
They should definitely have Call of Booty.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.680
Well speaking of World of...

53:51.680 --> 53:52.680
You know what?

53:52.680 --> 53:53.680
I should...

53:53.680 --> 53:54.680
Okay.

53:54.680 --> 53:57.320
I have this great entrepreneur idea here.

53:57.320 --> 53:58.320
Would this sell?

53:58.320 --> 54:00.280
That we're going to share with the entire internet.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.280
I don't know.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
Patent pending.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.280
It's mine.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.280
Trademarked.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.280
You steal this, I sue you.

54:05.280 --> 54:06.640
Okay, here it is.

54:06.640 --> 54:13.340
Make a porn company that does nothing but video game tie-ins like that.

54:13.340 --> 54:16.200
I think there's an audience out there for that.

54:16.200 --> 54:20.720
We could do both gay, straight, lesbo, whatever, everything, trisexual, it doesn't matter,

54:20.720 --> 54:24.160
furries, sure, we'll find something for you guys too, Pokemon or something.

54:24.160 --> 54:28.000
I believe like Banjo-Kazooie porn.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.600
Because think about it, there are movie studios that make their porns based off of movies.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.080
The first one I ever saw was called The Boneheads.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.360
The first one I ever saw was Whore of the Rings, actually that wasn't the first one.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
Remember Ally McPheil?

54:39.360 --> 54:40.360
That one was funny.

54:40.360 --> 54:45.920
Ally McPheil with Ron Jeremy, okay see, these porn studios make killings off of...

54:45.920 --> 54:48.520
off of TV spoofs and movie spoofs.

54:48.520 --> 54:53.520
How about video game spoofs and Final Fuck X?

54:53.520 --> 54:54.640
Who doesn't remember that one?

54:54.640 --> 54:56.320
That was a great Japanese import.

54:56.320 --> 54:58.320
We need some good, domestically made...

54:58.320 --> 54:59.320
Really good cosplay.

54:59.320 --> 55:04.360
Bring me your whores and your sluts and let's put them in some video game porn.

55:04.360 --> 55:08.100
I'll make them stars and make a lot of money in the process.

55:08.100 --> 55:12.040
Remember strippers are people too, naked people.

55:12.040 --> 55:16.680
Anyway, next story, right?

55:16.680 --> 55:19.320
Back to the world of something craft.

55:19.320 --> 55:24.540
Well, you know how everyone was all hyper about the character transfer system for World

55:24.540 --> 55:25.540
of Warcraft?

55:25.540 --> 55:30.280
Well, apparently it sucks a lot of ass.

55:30.280 --> 55:38.680
There's an article up on Kotaku that was written by someone who experienced this ass-ness firsthand.

55:38.680 --> 55:42.680
They're actually going through it saying that he offered a... what?

55:42.680 --> 55:45.320
Sorry, it's the chat room.

55:45.320 --> 55:46.560
Finish your story, then I'll go back.

55:46.560 --> 55:47.560
No, just tell me.

55:47.560 --> 55:48.560
Because now there's...

55:48.560 --> 55:52.240
Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls, I saw that at a store last week.

55:52.240 --> 55:55.720
Now they're going off on all these movies that we could make here.

55:55.720 --> 56:03.260
We have DMN says Super Princess Penis, DMN says Conquers Bad Furry Day, Mantic says Crash

56:03.260 --> 56:07.600
Bandicunt, DMN says Elite Beat Off Agents.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.600
You guys are brilliant.

56:08.600 --> 56:09.600
I love it.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.760
And Bandit says simply Paris Hilton's Gem Quest.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.560
That's practically porn anyway.

56:15.560 --> 56:16.560
You guys are awesome.

56:16.560 --> 56:22.280
Well, back to my story, our dirty-minded listeners.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.280
Chrome Horse.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.280
That was...

56:24.280 --> 56:25.280
Good one, Travis.

56:25.280 --> 56:26.280
Travis, yeah.

56:26.280 --> 56:27.280
Anyway...

56:27.280 --> 56:28.280
Yeah, no more porn.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.280
No more porn.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.280
Sorry.

56:30.280 --> 56:35.040
They finished the first step of the character transfer and paid everything on the credit

56:35.040 --> 56:36.240
card.

56:36.240 --> 56:38.240
They said it would take 12 hours to move it.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.240
They checked again.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.240
12 hours again.

56:40.240 --> 56:44.160
12 hours later, they checked again, and still another 12 hours.

56:44.160 --> 56:48.200
And people on the forums were bitching up a storm.

56:48.200 --> 56:53.680
And actually, there was a...

56:53.680 --> 56:57.640
They were basically putting the same old cut and paste response on the forum.

56:57.640 --> 56:58.640
Blah, blah, blah.

56:58.640 --> 56:59.640
This is normal.

56:59.640 --> 57:00.640
Working as intended.

57:00.640 --> 57:01.640
My butt.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.240
You know, that type of thing.

57:03.240 --> 57:10.200
And they said no one could resolve it by working with their customer service.

57:10.200 --> 57:14.880
It was suggested canceling the transfer and starting again, and no one else had any luck

57:14.880 --> 57:16.320
with it.

57:16.320 --> 57:21.120
So they actually checked it.

57:21.120 --> 57:22.120
Checked it.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.120
Nothing was going through.

57:23.120 --> 57:28.280
And they actually didn't bill, though, the credit card, you said, later, but there was

57:28.280 --> 57:33.680
an issue, though, with people who were using debit cards saying that the transfer would

57:33.680 --> 57:39.600
fail at the finalization stage and charge the account 20 euros for each failed attempt.

57:39.600 --> 57:43.400
And it was redoing it over and over and over.

57:43.400 --> 57:48.040
So they encouraged them to retry it, yet it was withdrawing 20 euros every time.

57:48.040 --> 57:50.320
It looks like it was retrying it on its own.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.320
Oh, nice.

57:51.320 --> 57:57.260
So it wasn't charging credit cards, like I said, but it was charging debit accounts and

57:57.260 --> 58:01.120
draining people's bank accounts.

58:01.120 --> 58:10.960
So Blizzard hasn't worked for about eight days, and Blizzard finally came out and said

58:10.960 --> 58:11.960
something about it.

58:11.960 --> 58:17.680
But there has not been a statement issued by Blizzard.

58:17.680 --> 58:21.780
There hasn't been an ETA as to when they're going to get that fixed.

58:21.780 --> 58:26.200
As I understand it, though, this is only screwing over the euro banks, not American transfers.

58:26.200 --> 58:34.480
That's what I'm seeing right here, but they can't just be so closed-mouthed about this.

58:34.480 --> 58:36.560
They have to be ford with it.

58:36.560 --> 58:39.800
They're going to lose so much freaking business.

58:39.800 --> 58:44.060
On top of that, there's any type of number of suits that are going to come up over just

58:44.060 --> 58:46.880
how much money they've taken from these bank accounts.

58:46.880 --> 58:51.360
They've really screwed themselves with this.

58:51.360 --> 58:55.040
When you see it happening, you stop the service.

58:55.040 --> 58:56.600
You do it right then.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.680
It's just ridiculous.

58:58.680 --> 58:59.720
Not cool, not cool.

58:59.720 --> 59:04.240
Hopefully there will be some type of compensation or free time given.

59:04.240 --> 59:05.240
No free time.

59:05.240 --> 59:06.240
They have to give these people their money back.

59:06.240 --> 59:10.140
Well, that too, obviously, but something else for their troubles.

59:10.140 --> 59:12.320
It's no fun having a dry bank account for a few days.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.200
Trust me, I've been there.

59:14.200 --> 59:20.320
At least the banks have been freezing the accounts that are in question.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.320
That's good.

59:21.320 --> 59:26.160
Dark Sakura, would you watch a movie called Select Caliber 3?

59:26.160 --> 59:30.680
Hell yeah!

59:30.680 --> 59:33.240
Black Boy says, Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.240
That sounds fun.

59:34.240 --> 59:37.440
I thought there was a game, Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll.

59:37.440 --> 59:38.640
Yeah, but it could be a porn too.

59:38.640 --> 59:43.240
Sorry, I promised we wouldn't do any more of the porn, but some of them are just so

59:43.240 --> 59:44.240
damn funny.

59:44.240 --> 59:45.240
What can I say?

59:45.240 --> 59:47.280
Skype line's open.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.280
You can call us.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.640
Go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

59:49.640 --> 59:50.800
Click on interact with us.

59:50.800 --> 59:57.960
The user name is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can pick up the telephone and call, 916-226-9067.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.360
In the meantime, some quick last minute stories, some things to squeeze in there.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.260
I did want to mention this.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:08.880
If you're a fan of the game In the Groove, you can now, with this latest update they've

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.280
done on the machine, you can do your own custom MP3s and steps.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.760
So basically, In the Groove has basically come out and legitimized itself as Step Mania

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.760
in the arcade.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.520
There's only one problem though.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.520
What are they going to do for audio licensing since I'm sure they didn't address that since

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:33.800
the game is not licensed on the machine and usually the machine will cover the licensing

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:38.280
for the songs that are in the game, but now that place, say if the RIA comes in and hears

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.000
someone playing Christina Aguilera or something like that on the machine, they could sue them.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.960
Sorry, Chatham is correcting me and saying it's actually OGG files.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.960
We are starting to get some calls.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.960
We'll come back to this in a minute.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.960
Who's this?

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.960
Hi.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.960
This is Sephiroth1215 here.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.960
Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.600
What's on your mind?

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.560
I'm pretty much fresh off of Digital Life.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.080
How is Digital Life?

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.320
Tell us a little bit about this.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.640
The first time you get in there, it looks kind of cool.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.140
It's nice and big.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.800
So much to see, but it's really not that great this year.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800
Really?

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.900
Why is that?

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.880
You had some good things.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.880
Maybe a few gaming booths, depending on what you like, though.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.880
Now Digital Life is not exclusively a gaming show, right?

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.480
There's lots of stuff there.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.480
No, there's plenty of stuff there.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:41.480
Probably a lot of the space, though, was from MLG and another gaming league of some sort.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.880
Was Sony the best booth there?

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.840
Sony's booth was kind of small, not to mention it was right next to Microsoft's booth.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840
Really?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.560
Did you get your hands on the plate?

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.100
I got to play the PS3.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.040
It played very well from what I got to see.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.720
It played a little bit of Resistance.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.520
Okay, that's something that didn't have an E3, I don't think, right?

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.760
What did you think of it?

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.760
It was good.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:15.840
I was more so looking at the graphics and the movements of the characters more so than

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840
the gameplay, though.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.020
What do you think?

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:23.120
Did this sell you on the game, or on the system, I should say?

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:30.280
It proved to me that the system can be more solid than I originally thought, because I

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.760
thought maybe everything was going to be kind of blocky, or it wasn't...

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.040
I don't know how to explain it, really.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.680
But I guess just to compare, I got to play the Wii a bit, and I played Elibits, and oddly

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.400
enough there were problems playing that.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.360
Oh, what kind of problems?

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:56.240
The controls were off, I mean, you had to stay to the left, and it had the same kind

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.800
of problem that Sonic did, where you go a little bit and the cursor goes far off into

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800
the screen.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.440
Was it just maybe miscalibrated?

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.640
It might have been, I'm not quite sure.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:15.960
It was only a demo of the game, so it could change later, not to mention the loading time

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.760
was way over a minute, just to even start the demo.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:26.200
Hmm, wow, so that's interesting, kind of a different reaction than we heard from E3,

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.920
where everybody was buzzing about the Wii and not so buzzing about the PS3.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.720
What do you think was the best thing you saw at Digital Life?

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.800
Honestly, the best thing at Digital Life was the DDR booth, which is where I was working

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.120
all weekend.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.440
What was there, what was at the DDR booth that made it so great?

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.960
There's tournaments going on all weekend long.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.920
Not to mention, we were the only booth that had the best giveaways.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.720
What kind of stuff was being, oh, that's right, because they do like the $1,000 tournament

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.720
there or something, right?

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.240
Like big, big money.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:04.440
Overall, it was about over $8,000 worth of prize money and prizes.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.640
I'm kind of pissed I missed New York City by a week, I would have loved to have been

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.640
there.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.560
Honestly, it's alright, because from what I hear they're having talks about, it's not

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.320
completely official yet, so you can't take my word on it, is next year, because there's

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.920
no more big E3, there's also going to be a Digital Life in LA.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.920
Oh, interesting.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.840
We might have to check that out.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.680
Are you going to be at Nintendo World Store Saturday at noon, because I'm going to be

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.680
there?

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680
Yeah.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.680
Alright.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.520
Not to put you on the spot or anything, but if you're not there, I'm going to cry.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.520
No, I'm kidding.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.520
I might have to see you.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.000
No, I didn't know you were going to be there Saturday.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.680
Oh, did you not hear the part A?

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.680
Yeah, I'm going to be there Saturday at noon.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.680
Okay.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.680
I'll be there.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.680
Alright.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.680
Well, we'll see you then.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.680
Anything else you want to say for listeners?

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.680
No, not really.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.680
Alright.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.680
We'll go to some more calls.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.520
Glad to hear you had a good time at Digital Life.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.520
Take care.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520
You too.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.520
Laid up.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520
Alright, bye.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.520
Bye.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.120
Let's go to another call here on our Skype line.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.880
It's Orange Lounge Radio, username on Skype, or you can always give us a call on the old

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880
regular telephone.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880
It's 916-226-9627.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.880
Yes.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.160
Let's go to another call.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.440
Yes, you're on the air.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.840
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840
Who's this?

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.160
Legend of Zaku.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.160
Hold on, Legend of Zaku.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.480
You need to sit tight for a minute.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.720
Just a hint, guys.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.600
I'm going to let you in on a little radio secret here, okay?

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.480
Sometimes we pick up the calls a little bit before I'm ready to acknowledge that you're

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.560
actually on the line just because it makes for a smoother transition that way.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.880
So until we say, Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.880
Shh.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880
Be quiet.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.880
Be quiet.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880
Alright.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.880
Zaku, what's on your mind?

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.160
Yo, I was also there too, man.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.280
I was also at Digital Life.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.320
I had a feeling you'd have something to say on Digital Life.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.320
As a matter of fact, I competed.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.480
I competed in freestyle on Saturday.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.480
And how was it?

01:05:53.480 --> 01:06:00.280
And what I'm about to post right now in the chat room is a link to the actual, to my routine.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.600
Granted, it was a bad routine.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600
Get it?

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.800
Yes, you got the get it joke right there.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.800
Hold on.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800
I did give the audience a good opportunity.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800
Hold on.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.800
I'm actually looking at it right now.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.800
Let me turn this down.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.360
Yeah, it was a bad routine.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.080
You're looking at the screen.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.480
How long did you practice this?

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.580
I was totally unprepared for this.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:25.400
This was an improv all the way.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:30.880
I was like, yeah, you got some cool alarm movements there, but yeah, Zaku, you're looking

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.120
at the screen too much, buddy.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.120
I'm sorry.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.120
I know.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120
But it's alright though.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.760
I wouldn't care less right now because I had a good time and I have no regrets for that.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.040
Did you see somebody left you a comment to go dance on some landmines?

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.240
The internet's mean.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240
Alright.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.880
I also played the Wii.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.160
Yeah, what did you think of the Wii?

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160
On Elibits, definitely.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.720
That was hot.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.720
You liked Elibits?

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.040
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.680
I mean, it was fun for the fact that you could actually aim and move stuff around.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.360
It wasn't miscalibrated for you?

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:15.320
Yeah, I mean, it was a little jerky, but I had to move a little bit back because when

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.960
I moved up closer, it wasn't even engaging.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:24.880
The more further away I was from the screen, the more better the controls were.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.880
What about PS3?

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.320
Did you get your little hands on the PS3?

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.480
The lines were pretty long for that.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.400
I managed to play Guitar Hero 2 as well.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.040
What did you think of that?

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.960
It's kind of like the same thing.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.840
It just has more difficulties.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.160
You can select characters and guitars.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.520
Here's another last minute story involving Guitar Hero 2 now that you brought it up.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.520
Yeah, about the controller.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.520
Hey!

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520
Hey!

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.520
Who's hosting this show?

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520
I'm sorry, man.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.360
I'm sorry about spilling the beans, as you were.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.840
You might as well finish your thought.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:00.680
Zaku, why don't you play OLR Reporter here and tell us this story about Guitar Hero 2?

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:10.760
From what's being said, a demo version is not allowing you to play third-party controllers.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:16.920
In other words, this company that essentially made its name on making third-party controllers

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:23.080
has locked third-party controllers out of its next game, according to the demo, if the

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.020
demo is any indication.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.520
Right now, I've got to go, but I'll let you know.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.880
I have some freeze swag.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880
What happened?

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880
What's going on?

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880
Why do you have to go so fast?

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.280
Now, I've got some stuff to take care of.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280
All right.

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.120
I'll let you know if any freeze swag has something to do with it.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.120
All right, Zaku.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:48.080
Go tell the cops who said aye.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080
Worst call ever.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:55.720
This is the part in Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood that we learn about the word of the day.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.160
The word of the day is fire escape.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.720
You know what a fire escape is?

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.760
Cabbage Patch Kid.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.960
Hi, Aaron Orange Laudreo.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.960
Who's this?

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.960
Hi.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960
It's Rama.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960
Hi, Rama.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960
What's on your mind?

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960
Hi, Rama.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.840
Hi, Uchan.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.840
Go figure.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.160
All the New York City listeners are trying to hammer like mad to get through tonight.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160
Let me guess.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160
Did you go to Digital Life?

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160
Yes, I did.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.720
You did say last week you want all the New York callers to call in, so we did.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.720
All right.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.720
Well, what's on your mind?

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.720
How was Digital Life?

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720
It was fun.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.240
Yesterday I didn't get as much swag, but today I got there early, got plenty of good stuff,

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.240
mostly t-shirts.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.840
Did you get to play PlayStation 3?

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.120
I didn't even bother.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120
Why not?

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.920
They had NBA Live up there, and it was like everybody else was around there like drooling

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920
over NBA Live.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.640
I'm like, it's just a game.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.320
I played at the $600 brick last week and walked away, played the Wii.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.720
You're cutting out a little bit there.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.240
You said you didn't play the $600 brick, but you played the Wii?

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.240
Yes.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.240
How was the Wii?

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.520
It was a little bit new to me.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.520
I played Elibit.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520
It was fun.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.640
Was Elibit the only game they had there or something?

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.040
No, they also had Madden for the Wii, but EA shut down now for some odd reason.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040
Oh, okay.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040
What did you think of Elibit?

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.280
It was fun.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.200
I didn't even want to get off the machine.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.200
Okay.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.200
What happened with DDR?

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.480
Did you do any of the DDR stuff?

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.320
I walked over there, but it was so crowded, so I just watched.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.600
I just hung out with Zaku and Sephiroth for a bit.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600
All right.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600
I mostly...

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.320
And you're all going to come see me in New York next week, right?

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320
I'm telling you.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320
Get in touch with me Friday night for dinner.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320
All right.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320
Sounds good.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.000
Well, I'll email you with the real itinerary a little later.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Of course.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.240
That's the only thing I'm publicly saying I'm doing is the Saturday noon thing, but

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.440
I'll tell you a little more about what I'm doing later.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440
That's cool.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.440
All right.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.440
Anything else you want to share about Digital Life?

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.440
Man, it was fun.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:04.000
I mean, I remember talking before about how it's going to be the next E3, but it's more

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.160
of a tech explore than anything else, so...

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.080
So you're saying because of the fact it's a little bit too broad in its tech specs that

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.040
it may not have the power to be the next E3?

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.160
I don't see it happening any time soon.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160
I don't.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.160
All right.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.160
Well, we'll see.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.160
We'll see.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.160
Especially if there's a Digital Life LA.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.160
We'll see.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.160
All right, Rama, thanks for the call.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160
No, Saturday.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.160
You got it.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.160
Friday.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160
Maybe Friday if you're lucky.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.160
All right.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160
All right.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.160
Later.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.160
Hey.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.160
That was Rama here, another New York City listener.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760
Who's this?

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.760
Raven's Dolphin.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760
Hello, buddy.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.480
What's on your mind?

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.160
You made me force me to get a Wii order.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160
Hold on.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160
Hold on.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.160
Sit tight for a minute there.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160
Hold on.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.200
Extrovert snuck in here while we've been taking these calls.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.280
Did you notice, Extrovert, that all the same people that call into the Wednesday show call

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280
into this show?

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.640
Isn't that funny?

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.040
That is mucho hilarious.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.480
Yeah, it's great.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480
It's the same people.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480
Listen to both shows.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.480
It's amazing.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480
I'm sorry, Raven's Dolphin.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480
What were you saying?

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.520
You were saying something about the Wii pre-ordering?

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.600
You forced me to get a Wii order for the day of Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600
What did I do?

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.600
Get a gun to your head?

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.600
No.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.600
You've been talking about, you've got to get a Wii.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.600
You've got to get a Wii.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600
You've got to get a Wii.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600
What did I say?

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.600
You've got to get a Wii.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600
You've got to get a Wii.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.760
But that's what's going through my mind.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.760
You're like, Wii.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760
Like, 200?

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.240
No, because I want a Wii really badly.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.480
As I said earlier, I referenced what I told that email bag thing earlier.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.880
You really have to make decisions based on what's best for you.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.960
And what's best for me right now, Wii.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.360
I figured your logic too.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.360
I'm going Wii 60 all the way.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360
How was your experience pre-ordering?

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.520
Where did you go?

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.520
How was it?

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.000
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.600
The mall I didn't go to was jammed.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.440
I mean, God, I'm glad I didn't go there.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.760
But the one in Atlantic City was nice.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.560
I stood in line for an hour and 40 minutes.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.240
It was like this woman, her car broke down.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.320
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.200
But her kid wanted the Wii so bad.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.400
It was eight people.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.400
And they were all nice.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.920
Wait, it was eight people that all came together?

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.880
Or it was eight people on the line?

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.880
Eight people in line.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.880
Oh, that doesn't seem...

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.560
Whereabouts are you from?

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.900
Atlantic City.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.440
That doesn't seem very long, all things considered, for a town like Atlantic City.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.920
Only eight people on the line.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.920
Huh.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.920
Well, okay.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.640
We're a small town.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.960
The only thing we do is gamble.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.960
I guess that's true.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.960
That's true.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.280
Yeah, but I bet the Vegas GameStop lines were long.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280
I bet.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:40.280
Well, you know, one of the best places to go for cheap electronics is pawn shops in

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.300
gambling towns.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.040
So go to your local pawn shop.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.040
Find a Wii.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.040
That's a good suggestion.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.320
Well, what did you pre-order with your Wii?

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.960
Did you just get the Wii or did you get any games?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.560
I just got the Wii because I know I have to have it Orange Lounge radio episode I can't

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.160
remember for the 19th.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160
All right.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.200
Yeah, I don't know what number it is either, but it's going to be an interesting show.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.680
Our buddy DMN is actually going to be here in-house.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.680
So we're going to have our Nintendo QA guy actually here in-house.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.000
So it'll be fun.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.080
Yeah, one more.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:17.480
I actually went to a McDonald's for a Wayport and it works pretty good.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.480
All right.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.480
That's cool.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.920
And you got a vision camera.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.320
Now we can have a Rob Astley.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.520
No.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.240
Not happening.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.880
Not without proper compensation.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.880
Bye.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.880
All right, freak.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.880
I'm hanging up on you now.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880
Bye.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880
Bye.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.880
What is up with that?

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880
What's with the...

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.640
It's so weird.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.640
Who would want to see that?

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.280
Who would want to see my ass on Xbox Live?

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.280
That's disgusting.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.280
Oh, Rob.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.400
You know everyone wants to see your ass.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.840
Not until I work it out a little bit.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.840
Sorry.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.840
I think they want to see your Wii.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.620
Well, they ain't going to get that.

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:50.620
One more call.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.840
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge radio.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840
Who's this?

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.840
It's Darkteeth.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.600
Hey, what's on your mind, Darkteeth?

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600
Darkteeth?

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.600
No, Darktetsuya.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.600
It's...

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.600
Darkteeth.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.600
It's short for Darktetsuya.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600
I'm sorry.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.600
Shut up and let the man talk.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.600
We have iced tea.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.600
We have darkteeth.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.600
He's one of our hardworking staffers.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.600
What's on your mind?

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.240
I had a few FUs.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.240
You have FUs?

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.240
Well...

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.240
Are they gaming-related?

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.240
Yeah.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.880
Okay, then we'll take them.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.880
What's up?

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:27.920
Well, you heard about Konami's little Link issue thing on Supernova?

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.960
Yeah, I guess they officially declared that Link Mode ain't happening this week, or, I

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.520
mean, this week the official press announcement went out, or whatever you want to call it.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.720
At least DDR Freak ran it, that said Link Mode's not happening in Supernova.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.720
That makes you mad?

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720
Yeah.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720
Oh, a little bit.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.360
Were you looking forward to making custom dance steps to songs such as, you know, what...

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.040
I don't even know what the hell songs are in Supernova.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.960
Well, I had it planned.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.960
I see.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.960
Okay.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.960
Any other FUs?

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960
Gaming-related?

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:04.840
Well, just that my local arcade hasn't gotten Supernova yet.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.480
What is up with lack of Supernova machines in Sacramento?

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.480
I know.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.400
I guess we're just not a real town.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.640
We're just some cow town in the middle of nowhere.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.560
Well, someday, Dark Tetsuya, someday.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560
Yeah.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.640
Hey, did you do any of the Wii pre-ordering or PlayStation 3?

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640
Oh, no.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.640
I'm not kidding.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640
Are you going to be getting any of them?

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.440
I'll probably get a Wii for Christmas.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.440
Okay.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.960
Oh, you're hoping Santa will bring you one?

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.280
Yeah.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.480
Have you been good this year?

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.480
Oh, yeah.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.760
Well, then maybe Santa will bring you one, so that'll be cool.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.760
All right.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.440
Or he'll give you a spanking or some coal.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440
Yeah.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.840
If you've been bad, though, you'll get a six axis, and that's all you get.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.080
You just get the paperweight of a six axis.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.680
You guys aren't on the Afterbirth, right?

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680
No.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680
We're on the actual podcast show.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680
Oh, wow.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.680
I've never been on the podcast before.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680
I guess this is my first time.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.680
Oh, sorry.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.140
Extrofer's one of our other personalities on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.560
He does the Wednesday night show with me, and what else would they know you from?

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.720
He had a train wreck show that was on the station a while ago.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.720
Yeah.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.720
It was called Train Wreck the Show.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.000
You play a lot of World of Warcraft.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.720
You've been on this show before, haven't you?

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.080
I've been on Orange Lawns Radio, but I haven't been on the podcast.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080
That is the podcast.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.080
Orange Lawns Radio is the podcast.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.080
No, no.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080
I was on it before you guys.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080
Oh, okay.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080
You did the live show and then the podcast.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080
Fine.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.080
Well, now you're here.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080
I don't fucking care.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.080
Welcome to the goddamn show.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080
Thank you.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080
Now be quiet.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.080
All right.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.080
Anything else on your mind, Dark Dead Sea?

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.080
Blood in your vagina.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.680
Well, other than that, I really like Supernova.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.680
Yeah?

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.960
Do you like the home release of Supernova?

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:32.960
Yep.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.960
Top three songs.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:34.960
Quick.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:35.960
Oh, God.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:42.440
That'll settle with that honor, humanity, and Gummel and the couple.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.440
Of course.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.920
Of course you'd say that.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.480
Guacamole del Taco, right?

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480
Oh, yeah.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480
All right.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.480
All right, Dark Tetsuya.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.480
Thanks so much for the call.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.480
Have a good one.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.480
All right?

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.480
You too.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.480
Later.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.780
One of our hardworking staff members there, that Dark Tetsuya.

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:57.280
We appreciate him.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.160
All right, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight, if you didn't get through.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.320
So sorry.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.320
Try again next week.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.320
Any other last minute stories?

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.760
Loki.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760
Of course.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.320
We talked about it earlier about video game movies and there being a movie called 8-Bit

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.560
the Movie.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.920
Well, actually, there is another movie coming out.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.680
For your PSP, you can download the entire movie.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:27.100
It's called Killing Time 24x7, and it is available online, actually, for full download

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.000
to your PSP, which I think is kind of cool.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.120
It's kind of like a Hitman movie, basically.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:38.400
The main character who kills people and in his spare time hangs out with his friends

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:44.040
and goes to arcades and whatnot and stuff, gets a new assignment, and his new hit is

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:48.360
his father, and so it's kind of based on that.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.360
It's actually pretty cool.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:56.360
The download itself is about 300, just over 300 megs, and you can actually find it to

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.200
download and I'm pulling up the website actually right now.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.200
Thrilling radio.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.200
Sorry.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:18.800
Yeah, but anyways, I believe it's killingtime-24-7.com if you want to download it, download it for

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.800
your PSP.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800
All right.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800
That's it?

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.800
That's all I have.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.800
Wow.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.800
For now.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800
That's all I have.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800
Usually you have a whole shitload of last minute news.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.960
Well, you know, I mean, we can talk about some other stuff, I guess, since we were talking

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960
about...

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.960
How about one sentence?

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960
One sentence news.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.960
One sentence news.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:36.960
Okay.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:37.960
Yes.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.960
Coming soon.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960
Sky's voice the game.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960
No.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:45.320
The, was it the, one of the professional gaming leagues in Pizza Hut teamed up and no one

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.320
cared.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320
That was good.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.040
That was one sentence.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.800
Tony Hawk's Project 8 gets some pretty awesome multiplayer on the 360.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.360
PlayStation 3 does not have any multiplayer whatsoever.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.240
I think that was two sentences, but that's all right.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.240
It was good.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.240
Send me a colon.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.240
Was there?

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.240
Okay.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.640
Um, Microsoft launched a new website to browse Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.720
Ah, I actually saw that.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.720
And that was pretty cool.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.920
Ah, that, see, you made it two sentences.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.560
I was, I was done with the story.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.560
Oh, sorry.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.560
Anyways.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.080
And the website is Xbox Pipeline or whatever that's called.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.760
Xbox Live Pipeline, something like that.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.760
Something like that.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.760
Anyways.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.760
We're so informative.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.760
Yeah, there's some website.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.360
I couldn't tell you what the name of it is.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.360
Whoa, okay.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.360
Here.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360
Okay.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.480
I will tell you the exact website because I am awesome like that.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:36.720
Anyways, the actual website is XboxLivePipeline.com, so go check it out if you haven't already.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.280
It has the look and feel of an Xbox.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280
It's kind of nice.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.280
It's pretty cool.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.760
I have some news.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.480
Okay.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.400
Loki is officially very funny.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.320
Last night we went and ate out at a, um, buffet place.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.320
Okay.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.440
I'm sorry, this doesn't have to do with the games.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.800
We killed people on the way because we were racing there.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.400
Is that good enough?

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:06.560
Anyways, Loki asks the waiter, the waitress or whoever she was serving us or whatever.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:13.840
She said he, he asked her if we, they're serving any popcorn shrimp and she goes, and he looks

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840
at her.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840
He goes, okay.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.920
And everybody's like, did you understand what she just said?

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.360
Loki's, Loki's just very calm.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.360
I didn't understand anything.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.080
Anyways, it's just so funny.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:30.320
Give it up for extra furnace, farewell performance here on Orange Labs Radio.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320
All right.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:36.400
Um, one thing I did want to mention, I read this week on the PlayStation 3 online web

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.160
browser they were talking about, um, that it has is for text entry.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.400
If you don't have, you know, a controller or whatever, it has that crappy text entry

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.040
that they have on the PSP.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.040
Isn't that stupid?

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.320
I just wanted to mention that.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:57.840
Um, some other fun stuff I was going to say, um, I remember, well, Japan's getting a brand

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:03.360
new Wii classic controller plus five or 5,000 point bundle, which is nice because we'll

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.080
never see that here.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:09.320
And I think that was all I had.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:14.080
Oh, oh, PlayStation 3 Oblivion's getting, was supposed to be getting exclusive content

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.280
for it, but it actually is going to be available for us as well.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.560
So on the Xbox 360 and PC.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.120
Oh well.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.840
Oh, a new Prey content for online multiplayer maps and stuff.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.400
I really haven't played much Prey.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.400
We should.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.200
It's some easy ass achievement points and achievement points more like you ought to

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.200
be efficient.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.200
I know.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.200
I'm meaning to get some.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.440
If you and I would play some death match, we could get those 25 kill achievements like

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.440
that.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440
It'd be easy.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.240
Just, yeah, too bad they don't have split screen multiplayer because that's how I did

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.280
it with, uh, Ghost Recon.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.280
Cheater.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.280
Cheater.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.280
All right.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.520
Um, I don't have any more last minute news.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.520
Dark Sakura?

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:57.320
Um, actually I did want to make a mention, uh, for our European listeners, um, that people

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:04.960
who are fans of Eurogamer, they've, uh, brought out a new download service, uh, for a $12.95

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:11.320
a month for the Ultimate Collection so you can get, uh, uh, different games.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.400
Um, they actually have, uh, for $6.95, access to the Essential Collection with 90 games

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.680
to choose from including Prince of Persia, Hitman, Contract, Splinter Cell, Pandora,

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.680
Tomorrow.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:27.160
Um, lots of different stuff coming up on there, um, but I would recommend going onto their

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.040
main page and taking a look at it.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.800
If you want to play, uh, Java or NES games on your PC at work instead of working, you

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:44.520
can go to vnes.thatsanderskid.com and they have a whole Java thing for playing Nintendo

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520
games.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520
All right, this is too much news for one night.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520
It's time to wrap up the program.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.520
I'm done.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.320
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.840
Extrofer, your final thought, dare I ask?

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.520
Loki, will you marry me?

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.160
Loki, your final thought.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160
No.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.160
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:09.800
Oh, yes, I forgot the Grudge 2 opened up this weekend.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.400
Who wants to go see it with me?

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.720
Not me, that's my final thought.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.560
Extrofer will go see it with me, won't you?

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.560
No.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.560
I'm kidding.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560
I'm kidding.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560
I'm kidding.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.560
Oh, damn, I wish it were a TV.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.560
No, I totally won't.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.560
You should see the way he did that.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.560
He kind of did this whole little...

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560
I will.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560
Well, no.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.560
No, I...

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.800
It's not you, Dark Sakura.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.800
It's the movie.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:33.800
I...

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:34.800
You know what?

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:35.800
No, I will see it.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:36.800
I just want to see Sarah Michelle Gellar die.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.800
I do, too.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.800
Oh, my God.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.800
Spoilers.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:40.800
No, she doesn't die soon.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.760
I saw a really good movie this last weekend, though, called The Departed.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760
It was so great.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.760
Great, great, great.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.760
Guess what?

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760
Guess what?

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760
What?

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760
Rob.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.760
What?

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.760
Rob.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.760
What?

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.760
What?

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.760
What?

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.760
What?

01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.760
What?

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.760
What?

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.760
What?

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.760
What's going on right there?

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.280
Two quick, quick quick things that came out.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:12.000
One thing that's being reported in our chat literally right this second, Bubble Bubble

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.020
for the DS is broken.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.360
Players cannot be past level 30.

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.500
This has been confirmed by Codemasters.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.960
Way to go, Codemasters QA.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.080
Loki, your thing, real quick?

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.820
Oh, I was just making fun of this thing.

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:29.420
They ran a report on Gizmodo about stuff that you can buy that looks stupid.

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:34.700
that you can buy that looks stupid. There's a Mame cabinet costume for Halloween. I just

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:39.640
thought it was funny because the joystick, which is abnormally large, is placed right

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:44.720
next to where his penis would be, and the coin door, which has two slots right where

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:49.460
his balls would be. That's just the college humor in me.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.440
That's lovely. And on that note, we're going to call it a night for Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.380
this week. Remember, we will not be live on Sunday next week. We're pre-taped because

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.420
both DarkSakura and I are traveling. Shh. God dammit.

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.700
Remember, YowieCon. Or New York City, Nintendo World Store.

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:10.700
Or Nightmare Before Christmas at the Metreon on Friday night.

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.900
And that- Exeter! Hey, I do a lot better than you do.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:18.900
I know. Can I just unplug that microphone? Yeah, there we go. See, now it's unplugged.

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:24.580
Thank you for supporting independent internet radio even when it's crappy like tonight.

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.580
Good night.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:30.580
