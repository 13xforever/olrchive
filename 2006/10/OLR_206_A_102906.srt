00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:38,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there in the land of internet broadcasting and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_06]: October the 29th of 2006.

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:50,533
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know, gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here to help you through that.

7
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,014
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:53,954
[SPEAKER_06]: You might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host over there in that corner, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:02,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I've taken a vow of silence for five seconds.

11
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'll introduce Loki.

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I give up.

14
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:08,242
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

15
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:08,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, though, Jamie?

16
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:10,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Head.

17
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:11,624
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a little headache?

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Little... I'm sorry.

19
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a migraine earlier, but I feel a lot better now.

20
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:15,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very hyper.

21
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:15,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for my coffee.

22
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:17,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

23
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,264
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a hyper Jamie tonight.

24
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,425
[SPEAKER_06]: That always makes for a fun show.

25
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And you forgot.

26
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:22,186
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

27
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,127
[SPEAKER_06]: When are we going to set that thing on fire?

28
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:26,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine!

29
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:28,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

30
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:28,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,710
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

32
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

33
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,231
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd the move go?

34
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It went good.

35
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:35,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, you know, without internet until tomorrow.

36
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:36,894
[SPEAKER_05]: That's got to stink.

37
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:45,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, because I just play... Well, actually, it's been so busy with unpacking, you know, last minute apartment stuff and all that stuff.

38
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Really haven't had a chance to, like, sit down.

39
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:53,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have been stealing my neighbor's wireless, but it only seems to work for about five minutes at a time.

40
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:55,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I get on there real quickly and

41
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:00,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Read news and try to check my email, and that doesn't always work.

42
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:04,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you tried to look at the shared folders on the network to see if there's porn anywhere?

43
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:09,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, her network is unsecured, but her shared folders are password protected.

44
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

45
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So they got it halfway right.

46
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:19,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that we endorse stealing Wi-Fi, but hey, if you're going to leave it open, people might use it.

47
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:20,007
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

48
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,609
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a special guest with us tonight.

49
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:26,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is nice because we actually have someone who I believe has never been on the program before.

50
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice to have some new blood on the show once in a while.

51
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:31,016
[SPEAKER_06]: So say hello, everyone, to Renee.

52
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:32,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.

53
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:32,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm here.

54
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:33,598
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, Renee?

55
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:34,299
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.

56
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be afraid to just put that mic right up to your mouth because they're not that sensitive, unfortunately.

57
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:39,063
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

58
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:40,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this better?

59
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:42,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Their emotions are sensitive, though, so don't make fun of them.

60
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,707
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to make sure they can all hear you.

61
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:45,828
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

62
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've been a listener of Orange Launch for a little while, right?

63
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,259
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

64
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but you're here and you brought your box with you.

65
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:17,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I brought my box.

66
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:17,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It has holes.

67
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:19,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

68
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:25,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, kids on the internet who are going to read into that statement, just, you know, freaking...

69
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:27,012
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

70
00:03:55,798 --> 00:04:02,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I like RPGs, rhythm and simulation type games, puzzles.

71
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:03,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, very cool.

72
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,508
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical gamer girl.

73
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, welcome to the program.

74
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:09,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

75
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, something occurred to me this morning.

76
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,443
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually, at one point, worked in the industry a little bit, didn't you?

77
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do, actually.

78
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:14,644
[SPEAKER_00]: You do?

79
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:15,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.

80
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:15,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

81
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:17,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you used to work at Konami a couple years ago.

82
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to work at Konami.

83
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:21,089
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I actually started off.

84
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:30,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in the DDR community for a while, and that's when I started listening to Orange Lounge Radio because that's where all the cool kids went to.

85
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,497
[SPEAKER_00]: They listened to Orange Lounge.

86
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Love the endorsement.

87
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:32,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

88
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:33,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

89
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:38,955
[SPEAKER_00]: and I met Mike Ngo, also known as Asian Innovation.

90
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:40,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Best rapper ever.

91
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if you have to deal with him rapping at work, I'll tell you that.

92
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,684
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but his drunken rap's pretty funny.

93
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, it is pretty funny.

94
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:51,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I...

95
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:57,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him and he said, you know, do you like video games?

96
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:57,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah.

97
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to be a video game tester at Konami?

98
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, sure.

99
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:04,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where I started off at Konami.

100
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:09,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing step data and then I moved into functionality QA testing.

101
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I left QA to go pursue other things.

102
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:17,817
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens, it happens.

103
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:18,398
[SPEAKER_00]: You move on.

104
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:25,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then actually I went back into the video game industry to go to LucasArts, and I was a QA tester there.

105
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:29,204
[SPEAKER_00]: I did compliance testing, so that's like standards, first-party standards.

106
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:37,769
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, testing to make sure that if we are developing a game for Microsoft or Sony that they have the right terminology or, you know, doesn't...

107
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:48,954
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've heard from some people in the industry is that those companies are very strict on, you know, you have to call this button like the, you know, the Xbox 360 guide button is the official.

108
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:54,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And like whenever you can't say, oh, that center silver glowing button or the silver button on the cover, it has to be the guide button.

109
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

110
00:05:56,157 --> 00:06:02,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Microsoft and especially Sony, they're very stringent that you have to use...

111
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,592
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

112
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:15,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad things happen, yeah.

113
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,610
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

114
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot more that goes into putting a game on a multi-platform than you might think at first.

115
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:22,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.

116
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:36,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen games fail submission from going into production just because of the fact that the message that comes up when you unplug your controller wasn't correct.

117
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:37,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

118
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:38,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

119
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:39,763
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money too.

120
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:46,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like at least a couple thousand each time you submit to Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo.

121
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:47,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

122
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:47,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

123
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:48,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

124
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:49,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks for the insight.

125
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:50,468
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

126
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:51,529
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.

127
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:55,611
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I'm working at Perpetual Entertainment.

128
00:06:57,431 --> 00:07:04,755
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't come up with any games yet, but the two games that they do have in development is Gods and Heroes, Rome Rising, and Star Trek Online.

129
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:05,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

130
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:06,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek Online.

131
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online?

132
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

133
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

134
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's something I might get into.

135
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the resident Trekkie.

136
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a closet Trekkie, a little bit.

137
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Shh, don't tell anyone, but I like Treks.

138
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:20,248
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in the closet for some things, but out of the closet for others.

139
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:22,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

140
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

141
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still kidnapping you to go see Warp 11.

142
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN says that DNL is his hero.

143
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:29,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Because your name in the online world is DNL.

144
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:29,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,521
[SPEAKER_06]: DNL is DMN's hero.

146
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:56,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of initials.

147
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:57,943
[SPEAKER_06]: We have alphabet soup going on here.

148
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:02,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's get into what we do at the top of every show and talk about our gaming week.

149
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

150
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I played stuff, actually.

151
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

152
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:06,970
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you play?

153
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we had a barbecue at my place last night that somebody who was invited didn't show up for.

154
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:12,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, other things, you know.

155
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:13,134
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

156
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:13,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy boy.

157
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:14,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to tease.

158
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:21,320
[SPEAKER_03]: But we broke out the 360 and played... Okay, we had to see how awful the Sonic demo was.

159
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's actually pretty damn good at controlling that.

160
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,277
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

161
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:41,741
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty funny.

162
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:51,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they put up the fear demo, but it was actually cool because Alex had been playing it on PC and was going through the differences between the PC and the Xbox 360.

163
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:54,484
[SPEAKER_03]: In his opinion, he said it was actually pretty damn close.

164
00:08:55,465 --> 00:09:00,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say that I'm probably going to play fear if I don't get motion sick from it.

165
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:05,007
[SPEAKER_03]: The demo did not make me that motion sick because first person shooters always do that to me.

166
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, though, the very freaky elements.

167
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:09,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's like, okay, watch this.

168
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:10,675
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about to get all Silent Hill.

169
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:11,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Look!

170
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, ooh, blood.

171
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:23,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I did hang out with Jamie this week outside the show, which was fun, and I got to see the walkthrough of the Fear demo as well, and it looked pretty neat.

172
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:30,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't usually get into first-person shooters, but I like the whole freaky element that Fear has going on, and I kind of missed it on the PC.

173
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:33,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do a whole lot of gaming on the PC.

174
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize to our PC gamer fans.

175
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:40,389
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple once in a while that'll make me look, but Fear's maybe something I'll look at on the console, for sure.

176
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:46,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apart from that, I actually played my first game.

177
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:50,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I had Dan play it for me because I was sort of, my eyes hurt.

178
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:55,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So he played Uno on my gamer tag, and my first game was one with a draw four.

179
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:57,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, hey!

180
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we saw somebody picking their nose on the webcam.

181
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:06,856
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty tame compared to a lot of things I've heard that people are seeing on Uno webcams.

182
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing is as fun as Dan shit-talking, though.

183
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:10,587
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

184
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,228
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

185
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:06,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, but the voice acting sort of irritates me, and hearing the main song in English irritates me as well.

186
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, whoever they got to sing just can't.

187
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:16,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a very bad problem with professional singers who are tone deaf, because that's what this lady sounded like.

188
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:21,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was really it for my gaming week.

189
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:27,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I did try to play a little bit of Pirate King, but I had some computer issues, and I think I'm just not going to play that anymore.

190
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It got kind of boring really fast.

191
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cute game, just boring.

192
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex in our chatroom offers some advice.

193
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:37,298
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, yeah, Jamie, it's been doing that to everyone.

194
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:40,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to keep trying until it works in regards to Phantasy Star Universe.

195
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:44,163
[SPEAKER_06]: It did that to me once, but then when I went back in, it worked.

196
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:51,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm thinking that I'm going to try to recreate my Ranger character.

197
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,713
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

198
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:18,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

199
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:44,649
[SPEAKER_03]: They were a very busy store, but for as busy as they were, I was noticing that they were trying to give everybody attention.

200
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, to me, was just really kind of refreshing to see at a game store.

201
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:57,815
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good advice for any employees that we might have that listen to this show, because I know we do have some employees of certain games, not just GameStop, but GameCrazy, all the other ones, too.

202
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:01,857
[SPEAKER_03]: My hubby is no longer associated with GameStop, but that still doesn't mean I hate them.

203
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:02,557
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty.

204
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

205
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Die or Explode or just glitches in the game.

206
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's really entertaining.

207
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:37,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the Tony Hawk's Project 8 demo and I don't care for it one bit.

208
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:39,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a great game, I'm sure.

209
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's too technical now.

210
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:50,357
[SPEAKER_05]: If you aren't really into Tony Hawk and you're picking this up the first time to go into it, you're going to have trouble doing a lot of stuff.

211
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:54,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt an awful lot, whereas Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it was

212
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:59,479
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun to be able to pull off crazy stuff, and it wasn't too hard.

213
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:08,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're just giving you way too much damn control over stuff, and I think that'd be good if you know what you're doing, but if you don't know what you're doing, that's not really good.

214
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:08,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

215
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:12,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty, though, so I don't know.

216
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,044
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the other demo I was going to try?

217
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:19,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant to try Rainbow Six, but I was waiting for...

218
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:21,116
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,030
[SPEAKER_05]: We're waiting for Vice City Stories.

220
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out on Tuesday, so we'll be able to switch out the games pretty soon.

221
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll have a full review of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories next week.

222
00:14:49,555 --> 00:15:01,162
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, though, we're finishing up Liberty City Stories, and I am still kicking major ass in our killing spree at work.

223
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:06,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, I'm ahead by, I think, 30 kills, which is awesome.

224
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:07,206
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

225
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:08,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

226
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no.

227
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,196
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

228
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:50,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know.

229
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:51,086
[SPEAKER_05]: For half the game?

230
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,547
[SPEAKER_06]: For half the PSP version?

231
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just... I don't know.

232
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay, I guess.

233
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,628
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have problems with some of the graphics in there.

234
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:03,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, some of the tile sets that they have are hard to see.

235
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:03,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

236
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:06,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really hurts my eyes to try to concentrate on it.

237
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:11,670
[SPEAKER_05]: If they had an option to keep a specific tile set and just change the music or something, that would be great.

238
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can do that in a different mode, but then you don't unlock new skins.

239
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Q Entertainment.

240
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:55,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, my gaming week, I played Phantasy Star Universe, now I can finally talk about it because I've played the commercial release, and so I feel a little better giving a full review of this game.

241
00:16:56,129 --> 00:17:03,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Phantasy Star Universe a lot because it's different from other MMOs because it's a little more action-oriented from what you're used to.

242
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:14,280
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft have action elements, but in the end, I feel that Phantasy Star Universe is a lot more kind of action-oriented than the others.

243
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

244
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:46,397
[SPEAKER_06]: But I agree with Jamie that whoever's singing that opening song is pretty bad.

245
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,878
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, a lot of animes have cheesy openings.

246
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:55,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But literally, you play the game in chapters, and every chapter starts off with the same cheesy anime-ish opening.

247
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:58,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not actual anime, but they use the in-game engine to do it.

248
00:17:58,322 --> 00:17:58,903
[SPEAKER_06]: But you'll see what I mean.

249
00:17:58,923 --> 00:17:59,883
[SPEAKER_06]: It's set up just like an anime.

250
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:03,785
[SPEAKER_06]: But the funny thing is, when you beat a chapter, then it goes like...

251
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:06,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time on Phantasy Star Universe.

252
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:08,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really funny, so I love the way it's set up.

253
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:10,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think the story's that bad.

254
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,707
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I don't like is that there's odd loading in cutscenes.

255
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they don't load the cutscene all at once.

256
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they'll load half, and then there's a cutscene, and then they do another.

257
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:19,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird.

258
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:22,528
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's got some weird loading issues, but you kind of get over that.

259
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:31,710
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I think I don't... I don't... It doesn't settle well with me in Phantasy Star Universe is that it seems like the...

260
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:33,743
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:02,862
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

262
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:26,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

263
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:41,736
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

264
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:16,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, the other game I want to talk about really quickly is Clubhouse Games for the DS, because I picked it up, but I haven't really talked about it on the show.

265
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:24,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool, there's a lot, a lot of games on it, and I think that value alone makes it worth a purchase if you're into the casual games.

266
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:29,935
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not into casual games, you want something with more depth, I don't think there's going to be a whole lot here for you.

267
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,896
[SPEAKER_06]: They try to make it a little longer...

268
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:36,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Gameplay and kind of streamline it all together with things like mission mode and stamp mode.

269
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:41,160
[SPEAKER_06]: But overall, it's nothing more than just an excuse to make you try every single game.

270
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little disappointed that online doesn't have certain games in it.

271
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So be careful before you pick up the game.

272
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:53,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Do some research online and see if the games you want to play online are even playable because they aren't all playable online.

273
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:54,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So be careful.

274
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want, I have that music queued up.

275
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me see.

276
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,370
[SPEAKER_06]: If it'll come through, hopefully.

277
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:01,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It should.

278
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting the level over.

279
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:04,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's like a cheesy MIDI version of it.

280
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:05,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear it.

281
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like a cheesy MIDI version of it.

282
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:12,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess for a phone it's not bad.

283
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll pick up in a second.

284
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:25,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, see, this makes me kind of go, why isn't this on the Xbox Live one?

285
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,349
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like the best song in the game, and they got it on the frickin' cell phone, but they didn't get it on Xbox Live?

286
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:30,389
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

287
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

288
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:31,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

289
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:32,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jamie.

290
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it turned out pretty nicely.

291
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for a cell phone game, that's not bad.

292
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,611
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I hate cell phone games usually.

293
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,712
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Renee, how was your gaming week?

294
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:42,672
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of games have you been playing?

295
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:49,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, besides the Hero Quest, I have been playing Clubhouse games as well.

296
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:57,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have Wi-Fi set up at my house, and so I've been stealing Wi-Fi from the Metreon because I live in San Francisco.

297
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:01,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only game that I've actually been able to play online is Darts.

298
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:03,631
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's fine.

299
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:16,634
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do understand that if there are some games that you do like and you definitely want to check out and see if you can play it online because I really was looking forward to playing Split or Spit.

300
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:19,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was the one I wanted to do too.

301
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:23,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I totally kill on that.

302
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:24,035
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm awesome.

303
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:24,835
[SPEAKER_00]: We should play again.

304
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:28,256
[SPEAKER_06]: See, we should have totally battled but we can't because you can't play it on the internet.

305
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:28,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Cry.

306
00:22:30,742 --> 00:22:32,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also played LocoRoco.

307
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:34,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that game.

308
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:36,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I've beat it like two times now.

309
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:37,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really cute.

310
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:45,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's made by SCEI or Sony Computer Entertainment International, which is Sony.

311
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:53,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you play as a world and there's these little LocoRocos that are these little yellow blobs.

312
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:59,817
[SPEAKER_00]: and you help them roll around and get rid of the mojos of the

313
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,854
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to invade the world, and that's basically it.

314
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:16,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the closest you can compare it to would be Katamari Damacy, but it's not really... It's kind of hard when you have these very original games to try and compare it to something else.

315
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:17,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.

316
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:20,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably people are going like, Phantasy Star Universe is like Zelda.

317
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:21,088
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is he saying?

318
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:21,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

319
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:23,730
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole sword slashing thing, I don't know.

320
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:25,952
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best thing I can name.

321
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:26,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

322
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:44,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I actually started playing LocoRoco again, because I basically beat it about a month ago, was because I had gone to visit the Sony store at the Metreon, a PlayStation store, and they had this little booth set up, and they had these little inflatable LocoRocos.

323
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,423
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like

324
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:52,034
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 1-inch or 1-foot LocoRoco inflatables and then this one huge 3-foot one.

325
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:57,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I walked up to one of the workers there and I said, Oh, are you guys selling these?

326
00:23:58,076 --> 00:24:00,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, No, actually, sorry.

327
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:03,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a little pouty face because that's what I do.

328
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I asked him, Well, can I at least look at it?

329
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:13,383
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he went behind the booth and he took the smaller one and he handed that to me.

330
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:21,864
[SPEAKER_00]: and so as soon as I had it in my grasp I held on to it and I gave it a quick little hug and I said, oh it's so cute!

331
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,510
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the girl I am.

332
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:30,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course his heart melted and he's like, oh, well, do you want it?

333
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,396
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, of course.

334
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:32,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, you can have it for free.

335
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And here it is with her today.

336
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,440
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here with me today.

337
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:40,644
[SPEAKER_00]: And before he could say, I'm just kidding, I squeed and I just ran out.

338
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:42,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very happy.

339
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:45,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You ran away before you could take it back.

340
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,390
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I started playing LocoRoco again.

341
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:50,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Another game that I've been

342
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:54,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, right now, I just picked up Cooking Mama.

343
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:58,599
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Bay Area, I've visited at least five different EBs.

344
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:05,365
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've asked every single time, every time I've gone, and this is multiple occasions, I ask, do you guys have Cooking Mama?

345
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:10,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as I've come to expect it, their answer is no.

346
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:17,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the little fangirl of Nintendo DS games I am, I pout.

347
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,252
[SPEAKER_00]: and walk away.

348
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:30,137
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, when I came to visit Sacramento, I went to the EV Games over in Ardenwood and they had Cooking Mama and right now, Mama is telling me to poke my steak.

349
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, okay.

350
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:40,082
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of game is this?

351
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:40,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Mama said.

352
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:47,346
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some sick, sick twisted little game under the cutesy farce of a Cooking Mama title.

353
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, well, you know, whatever Mama wants, she gets.

354
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Next we're going to have, like, Cooking Emeril, where he, like, yells out things while you're trying to cook.

355
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:57,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Bam!

356
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

357
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:01,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Mama wants you to come over here and poke my steak.

358
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:04,494
[SPEAKER_06]: This is dirty.

359
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:05,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Dirty, dirty.

360
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:06,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I need to get that game.

361
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:10,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

362
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:11,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's some girly thing.

363
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:12,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

364
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:12,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, forget it.

365
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

366
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:14,063
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

367
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:14,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's cool.

368
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:15,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, great.

369
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:17,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad you brought... Can I give your local Rokodoll a hug?

370
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:18,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can.

371
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:19,146
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.

372
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:19,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

373
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:20,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Here I go.

374
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:22,568
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great radio, by the way.

375
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:25,730
[SPEAKER_00]: If only you can see Rob now.

376
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,051
[SPEAKER_00]: He has the biggest grin ever.

377
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:27,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

378
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:27,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cute.

379
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:28,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very cute.

380
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:30,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have tried to steal one, too.

381
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:33,294
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I would have had to find a worker there that bats for my team.

382
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:34,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if there are any there.

383
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:36,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, it is San Francisco, for God's sake.

384
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:40,376
[SPEAKER_06]: The official Sony store is still there at the Metreon, even though Sony sold it, right?

385
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:40,596
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

386
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:41,436
[SPEAKER_06]: The Metreon itself.

387
00:26:41,736 --> 00:26:42,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

388
00:26:42,177 --> 00:26:43,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the Metreon last week.

389
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:44,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

390
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:46,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And how was your experience at the Metreon?

391
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:47,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D.

392
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

393
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had only had three hours of sleep and had been going all day.

394
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually fell asleep during the parts where they're handing out all the presents.

395
00:26:55,981 --> 00:27:00,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But right at the beginning, it's me, Chris, Megzi, and Mecco, who is our friend from Canada.

396
00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:03,144
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all trying to grab the snowflakes at the beginning of the movie.

397
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:06,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And then me and Megzi are like, ooh, Jack.

398
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:07,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

399
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:27,196
[SPEAKER_03]: When they've had her up there for the different positions and everything.

400
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:32,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go, and I think it's actually playing through, I think through December.

401
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,502
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go on to, actually just do a search for it, a website will pop up for Disney.

402
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:43,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually order your tickets through Fandango, which I highly recommend because it's going to be sold out the whole time.

403
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:44,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially this season, yeah.

404
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you can see it anywhere, go see it.

405
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:50,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's seriously, it is worth the view.

406
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:51,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

407
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,030
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

408
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And sitting in line was kind of fun, but not really.

409
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:55,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob runs out of the room

410
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:24,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Giddy like a little schoolgirl.

411
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:26,205
[SPEAKER_03]: That's adorable.

412
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:32,269
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, the ferret will serenade everybody.

413
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:33,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rob's back.

414
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,350
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have stayed gone.

415
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,811
[SPEAKER_03]: This could have been a ferret show.

416
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:41,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have shirts, so I don't know who wants what, but the white one seems a little more girly, so I'm going to give the white one to Jamie.

417
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:43,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I wear black, though.

418
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:44,195
[SPEAKER_06]: You want the black one?

419
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:44,855
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the black one say?

420
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,576
[SPEAKER_06]: The black one says, let's see.

421
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's white, I won't wear it.

422
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:48,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It says.

423
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:50,213
[SPEAKER_06]: The Quadfather.

424
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:51,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll take the white one.

425
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then I'll give the black one to Loki because he's kind of dark too.

426
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:57,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark and Gothic and Tragic and all that stuff.

427
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and the Resident God.

428
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is cool.

429
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Unplug and connect.

430
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some mouse pads as well, so I'm going to give one to Renee as well.

431
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:05,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

432
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:06,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

433
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:07,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you guys get mouse pads too.

434
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,202
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I wanted.

435
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:11,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizon Wireless Mouse Pad.

436
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:13,742
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny because I use Singular.

437
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:14,983
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought that was very nice.

438
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.

439
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:18,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was very nice that our listeners kept this in mind there.

440
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:19,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, folks.

441
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:21,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm also going to give Renee...

442
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:22,266
[SPEAKER_00]: No problemo.

443
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:22,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun with that.

444
00:29:46,002 --> 00:29:48,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping.

445
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:53,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And to start us off, we are going to reenact the voicemails of the week this week.

446
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:56,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a very special message from our webmaster.

447
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:57,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a listen.

448
00:29:58,372 --> 00:29:59,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

449
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:03,356
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Jason, and I have a very special and happy announcement from our webmaster.

450
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:10,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting as of right now, you have a toll-free number that any of you are willing to use.

451
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:14,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That number first off is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

452
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,422
[SPEAKER_04]: That is 1-877-4263-657.

453
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: This is unfortunately only open to the United States and Canada, but the rest of you still have Skype, and the program will work at any time.

454
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:27,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Free for you.

455
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:27,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.

456
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, awesome.

457
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're almost like legitimate radio here.

458
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:34,742
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our own 800 number, or 877 number, but same thing.

459
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:41,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a new toll-free number for you guys to use, and you can use that in interacting with our station when we take calls a little later in the program.

460
00:30:41,690 --> 00:31:10,435
[SPEAKER_06]: that number once again 877-GAME-OLR that's 877-426-3657 and because of the fact that we have the toll free number now we're thinking this might encourage folks to leave us voicemails so we are going to open up that segment we did a while back we're going to reopen up that segment for the voicemails of the week I'll let you know the topic a little later on in the program we'll take your calls on the new 800 number a little bit later the old 916 number still works for those of you in the area but I imagine most people probably aren't going to want to use that

461
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:13,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight marks the last week of our DDR previews.

462
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:16,367
[SPEAKER_06]: New songs for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.

463
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad that today's last week.

464
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:19,708
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing it for eight weeks.

465
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:21,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some new songs for you guys tonight.

466
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:22,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Very excited about that.

467
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio has a brand new YouTube channel.

468
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:30,353
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listened to last week's episode, I believe I threatened to put something up.

469
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:32,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the Loki drunk thing, playing Mario Kart.

470
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:34,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I threatened to put that up on YouTube.

471
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, so check that out.

472
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:40,418
[SPEAKER_06]: We are on YouTube under username Orange Lounge Radio and some folks have already found the videos and are

473
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that was an excellent quality scene.

474
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:46,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was formatted for the PSP.

475
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:47,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually didn't come out that bad.

476
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:48,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually came out pretty good.

477
00:31:49,044 --> 00:31:50,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I put some other stuff up there, too.

478
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:52,706
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some news bits.

479
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:54,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the Oh, It's So Much Fun clip?

480
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,829
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up there as well on YouTube.

481
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:03,133
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of them, there's a Guitar Hero story that has DarkSakura and Loki in it, and it came out squished for some reason.

482
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:03,973
[SPEAKER_06]: The video is squished.

483
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,454
[SPEAKER_06]: It's letterboxed, but not really.

484
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:07,535
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what to do about that.

485
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:09,777
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's all there if you folks want to check it out.

486
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:11,759
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

487
00:32:31,545 --> 00:32:41,129
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation 3 and a lot of things being pulled out of the PlayStation 3 including the fact that they will not have a gamer score system.

488
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:49,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally they were going to be putting out that entitlement system that everyone had a problem with because it kind of ripped off of the Xbox Live Achievement system.

489
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:53,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not going to happen according to Jack Trenton from Sony.

490
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:57,056
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no gamer score system at all.

491
00:32:57,136 --> 00:32:59,877
[SPEAKER_05]: They just kind of ran out of time and

492
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:01,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't feel like putting it in there.

493
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting there.

494
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:17,116
[SPEAKER_05]: If you happen to be lucky enough to snag one of the first PlayStation 3s out there, one of the first 500,000 of course, you may be getting a copy of Talladega Nights on Blu-ray.

495
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:22,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of course they really want to push that Blu-ray format with the Blu-ray drive being in the actual console.

496
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get to enjoy that Will Ferrell comedy.

497
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:26,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was actually pretty good.

498
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely worth it.

499
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:29,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like the

500
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:29,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Spider-Man 2

501
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:43,125
[SPEAKER_05]: and their launch games have really kind of slimmed down a bit.

502
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:50,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's first party stuff, they've got Resistance Fall of Man, NBA 07, and Genji Days of Blade.

503
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Those will all be launch titles.

504
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:59,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course, Lair and Warhawk have been pushed to next year, so you won't see those for a while.

505
00:34:00,113 --> 00:34:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: some other wonderful third party games so of course the exclusive Full Auto 2 will be coming out from Sega, Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, Ridge Racer 7 and of course they will also be getting versions of Fear, Fight Night Round 3 Elder Scrolls, Oblivion Blazing Angels, Call of Duty 3 Tony Hawk's Project 8 and all the big stuff so it's an interesting launch window I don't know so

506
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:34,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, some stuff not Sony related.

507
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:37,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous Live.

508
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there's been, of course, a lot of controversy over the whole buy half of a game, purchase the rest of the game.

509
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:46,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on, you know, kind of format.

510
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:51,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Mitsuguchi himself actually was interviewed by IGN.

511
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:53,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the questions they asked him was about that system.

512
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:55,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, he supports it.

513
00:34:56,475 --> 00:35:01,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, you know, saying, you know, Luminous, when it came out on the PSP, was more expensive.

514
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:05,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And he feels that, I guess, you should pay the same price on the 360.

515
00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:07,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much.

516
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:12,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll remember that when you release any other Q Entertainment games, like the wonderful 99 Nights.

517
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad I rushed out to buy that one.

518
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:20,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually did rush out to buy 99 Nights because I loved the demo and everything.

519
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:22,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I got mine for free.

520
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:24,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, la-di-da, lucky you.

521
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad I didn't spend my... I will say, though, I will not be buying Luminous Plus or Luminous 2.

522
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:36,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Or any of your Extend Extra, you know, every Extend Extra.

523
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Screw you, I'm not buying that crap either.

524
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will buy them all because I'm a whore.

525
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:43,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I probably won't get the PS2 one.

526
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,106
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a little bit of overkill, but I do want Luminous 2, and I do want every Extend Extra, so what can I say?

527
00:35:48,268 --> 00:35:48,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

528
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:49,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

529
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:55,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, um, so that pretty much does it for the big stories that we missed in that little bit of a gap.

530
00:35:55,622 --> 00:36:00,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I want to do some comments from chat real fast, because the chat room's just lit up on some of this stuff.

531
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:02,847
[SPEAKER_06]: JeremyTodd1 says, they ran out of time.

532
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:13,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of interesting to know that the 360 came out a year earlier than PlayStation 3, and yet it has achievements, and so the PlayStation 3 had an extra year to get it, but they couldn't even get this simple feature?

533
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:15,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, lack of achievements?

534
00:36:15,115 --> 00:36:16,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that going to kill the PS3?

535
00:36:16,496 --> 00:36:17,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a big deal.

536
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:20,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's really a big deal, but, um,

537
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:25,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's really interesting is some of the launch games not having online support.

538
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,971
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a big deal right there, I think.

539
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:32,211
[SPEAKER_03]: This just adds one of those little, you know, mouth protectors in Kudaragi's helmet.

540
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:35,752
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're an achievement points whore, Loki.

541
00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:40,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this lower your opinion of Sony, or do you really care?

542
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:47,415
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, Microsoft has this wonderful achievement system to get me to buy games I normally probably wouldn't buy, or to rent games.

543
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:48,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of, you know...

544
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:53,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, drives the market a little bit to get you to play more games.

545
00:36:54,034 --> 00:37:06,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess, I guess it would, you know, to be honest, it's not a real deal breaker for me, but I think the lack of online and certain games for them is a deal breaker for me.

546
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:07,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing is,

547
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:12,755
[SPEAKER_05]: They still haven't said what their online service has.

548
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:16,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're saying it's free, but I don't see multiplayer gaming.

549
00:37:16,877 --> 00:37:18,037
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed a friends list.

550
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:19,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, friends list is free.

551
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:21,278
[SPEAKER_05]: You get that free with Xbox Live.

552
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:25,699
[SPEAKER_05]: But they still have not come out and said multiplayer gaming is free.

553
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: They have not said that yet.

554
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm thinking it's probably not free.

555
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:34,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says, What about backwards memory card support for PlayStation 3?

556
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:38,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Firebomba in our chat says, I thought it wasn't a Sony launch until Ridge Racer game was launched with it.

557
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:02,608
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

558
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be Ridge Racer.

559
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:04,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridge Racer.

560
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:06,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to, at least one more time.

561
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:07,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is interesting.

562
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:08,313
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you didn't.

563
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:15,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Pendro lends an interesting perspective here on the Luminous microtransactions debate.

564
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,243
[SPEAKER_06]: If microtransactions total the price of a normal game, then that's kind of cool.

565
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:24,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And as somebody had calculated above, if you buy Luminous and all the microtransactions, it's going to be about $35.

566
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:26,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me put it this way.

567
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:26,710
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

568
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:40,176
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either they release it on live and you have the option to buy these microtransactions or they just port it and throw it out on a CD or DVD and just put it in there and you get it all anyways.

569
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:41,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the same game, kind of like Luminous+.

570
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:48,699
[SPEAKER_06]: What I didn't like about the whole thing is I felt they weren't very upfront about telling us what the game was not going to have.

571
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:58,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very disappointed to find Versus Computer wasn't there, because that's kind of a way you could unlock skins in the original PSP version, so I kind of went there to try and unlock more skins, and you kind of couldn't do it.

572
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:05,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a little bit disappointing, and I didn't realize that feature was going to be gone, or, well, have one stage only.

573
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:09,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I can understand downloading more skins, but I don't like downloading new features.

574
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:12,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I shouldn't have to buy two-player games.

575
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:13,600
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

576
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Blaze says they could have packaged Luminous as a real game and no one would be bitching.

577
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:18,166
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

578
00:39:18,707 --> 00:39:19,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

579
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but I don't know.

580
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:23,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have been a little less deceptive in my mind.

581
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:23,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

582
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:26,257
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a certain element of deception with this whole thing.

583
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm being overreactive.

584
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:28,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

585
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:33,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, also, one thing to consider being in the video game industry is the production costs.

586
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:47,842
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they would have to not only go through rigorous testing to ensure that all of the content in the game follows Microsoft's strict rules, but also how much it would cost to send and...

587
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:52,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the CDs and the manuals and things like that.

588
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you could just buy it online.

589
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:57,809
[SPEAKER_06]: True, but don't the online games go through a similar process?

590
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:11,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's not as rigid, but the way... Because remember when we had that story a couple weeks back about how Duke Nukem wasn't going to be on Xbox Live anytime soon because it would have to go through a process, and Microsoft supposedly has all these games in a queue waiting to go on the arcade?

591
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:19,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe there is still a process, but maybe it's less stringent than having to put the manual, do the clamshells, all that stuff.

592
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:19,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.

593
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:24,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would definitely cost less to go straight to live.

594
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:31,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the reason why they did it on live to begin with was that so they could, it started off as a microtransactions thing.

595
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:36,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, oh, we could sell the Madonna skin and we could sell, you know, whatever other artist skins we're going to have.

596
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:39,829
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it just turned into, hey, let's microtransaction for everything.

597
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:41,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's some interesting perspectives.

598
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we got an email on this too, so I'll save that for the mailbag.

599
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,511
[SPEAKER_06]: That lends an interesting perspective as well.

600
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sure we got more stories about it too.

601
00:40:50,024 --> 00:40:52,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's other stuff this week, but I haven't looked at the show rules, so.

602
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:54,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good job prepping for tonight.

603
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:59,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like, for example, the whole Madden training videos thing, where they want you to buy that stuff.

604
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:09,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people are starting to see, oh, microtransactions are working, then everyone's jumping on the bandwagon, but no one's getting it right.

605
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:19,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like one of those things, like back when motion sensing, ooh, motion sensing's cool, let's all release motion sensing stuff now, and

606
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:20,844
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

607
00:41:47,589 --> 00:42:05,924
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is a feature in the video game Bully that GayGamer.net and another site, I believe it was GameBrink, captured videos of hot boy-on-boy action, basically, that the main character in the game, Jimmy Hopkins, can kiss boys as well as girls in the game.

608
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:06,404
[SPEAKER_06]: A-boy.

609
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:13,944
[SPEAKER_06]: There are several, you have to inspect them first and you'll have an action option for Kiss.

610
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:16,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have the same animation as the females.

611
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:18,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I kind of sit back at this and I go...

612
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:34,049
[SPEAKER_06]: and keep in mind, I'm gay myself, and I'm kind of looking at this going, this is a way bigger deal than it ought to be.

613
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:42,434
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm just kind of sitting here going, you know, when it was in The Sims, you know, it was just kind of like, okay, you know, hey, you can just do this if you want, or do this if you want.

614
00:42:42,654 --> 00:42:54,502
[SPEAKER_06]: But now it seems to be like, I don't know, like with all these sites reporting on it and all this stuff, I'm just kind of like, you guys are making a big deal out of what shouldn't, you know, it's just, hey, if you want to play the game like this, if you want to try this, you know.

615
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Fable, you kind of did that too.

616
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:01,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why this is such a... It's dumb, and you know why?

617
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:06,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people are looking... They are... I swear to God, people are just making Rockstar the fucking scapegoat for everything.

618
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:11,105
[SPEAKER_05]: They are, like, scrutinizing these games to find something wrong so they can go and sue them some more.

619
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:11,945
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

620
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:22,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But before you go and start doing that, be, you know, warned that they did put this content... You know, they brought it to the attention of the ERSRB when they were giving it a team rating, so you know what?

621
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:26,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck off, because this is all kosher.

622
00:43:26,464 --> 00:43:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: People approved this for the teen rating, and that's it.

623
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:30,268
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the game.

624
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:30,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Play it.

625
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:36,775
[SPEAKER_05]: At least he's not bashing skulls in or eating brains or something like that.

626
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:38,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just fucking kissing.

627
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:39,878
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it is.

628
00:43:39,978 --> 00:43:40,499
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

629
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:42,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Bicarious people, they're...

630
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:44,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons of them in college and stuff.

631
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:56,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gives a shit about just, you know, a fictional character who's not even real kissing a fictional character who's not even real who happens to be disguised as a male person.

632
00:43:56,775 --> 00:44:01,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are, it's like saying, oh, you know, two puppets making out.

633
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:05,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but they're male puppets, you know, so that's really wrong.

634
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:08,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody really cried out about the whole, you know,

635
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:11,293
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

636
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:26,511
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

637
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not interested in you I'm interested in her

638
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:07,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And nobody would have blinked an eye.

639
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,046
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other weird thing.

640
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:11,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody would have blinked an eye at that.

641
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:20,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the vast majority, I hate to say it, the vast majority of gamers out there are, well, desperate young men who like to see hot lesbian action.

642
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,412
[SPEAKER_03]: They should just do a game called Hot Lesbian Action.

643
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:24,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It would sell.

644
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,693
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Dead or Alive Extreme.

645
00:45:27,353 --> 00:45:28,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, with independently moving boobs.

646
00:45:30,134 --> 00:45:33,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you sit on the other person's back and do... Sorry.

647
00:45:34,594 --> 00:45:35,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

648
00:45:35,574 --> 00:45:36,235
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you going to say?

649
00:45:36,555 --> 00:45:40,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say Vice City Stories actually has one of the main characters is a transsexual.

650
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:49,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't know who it is, but one of them is a, you know, we learn later on, one of them is a tranny, and they have a major role in the game.

651
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:55,101
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like Rockstar's trying to, I don't know, push the boundaries of it.

652
00:45:56,001 --> 00:46:00,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's just, they're just, you know, writing diverse characters into their games.

653
00:46:00,183 --> 00:46:01,803
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong with that?

654
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:03,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about time.

655
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:07,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for them, even though these kind of aren't the games that really interest me.

656
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:08,390
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.

657
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to go buy Bully just because it has this in it.

658
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:20,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know other people who did, and I'm kind of like, you know it's a game, and this is like five seconds of a game.

659
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:21,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

660
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why you would go.

661
00:46:22,901 --> 00:46:27,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe they're trying to support the cause or whatever, which, okay, whatever.

662
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:29,246
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what, though?

663
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go see a movie that had...

664
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:33,504
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

665
00:46:54,026 --> 00:47:22,218
[SPEAKER_03]: the film studios decided not to so Microsoft has issued a statement we're disappointed that Universal wanted to significantly renegotiate the financial points of the deal but the Halo franchise is hugely popular and our goal remains the same to find a partner that shares our passion and will creatively collaborate with us to best represent the story so it may happen but not anytime soon yeah I think this just means delays development hell yeah seriously oh well

666
00:47:23,326 --> 00:47:23,786
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

667
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:28,769
[SPEAKER_06]: If it takes that much time to get it right, I would much rather see them delay it and get it right.

668
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:35,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Halo is a game, so I think the games are what a lot of us are more excited about than the movie.

669
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So Hollywood, take your time, just don't fuck it up.

670
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:39,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

671
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:52,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Some interesting stuff, those rumored from Game Informers, they're saying that they have an insider that's let them know that Halo 3 is going to be getting a demo early next year.

672
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:21,256
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's pretty much all we know right now is speculation there might be a Halo 3 demo early next year and that would make sense considering the supposed release date of Halo 3 being March or April of next year so yeah, duh but one of the interesting rumors I also read about Halo 3 demos they were saying they might charge for it that was a weird rumor, I read that too

673
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:29,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, the only way I could see that being, I mean, well, you know, I guess they kind of already do that.

674
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:39,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can go to like Best Buy, I think, and buy a World of Warcraft 14-day trial for a couple bucks, you know, so I guess charging for demos isn't absolutely unheard of.

675
00:48:39,344 --> 00:48:43,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it does make a lot of people go, eh, but if people will pay it,

676
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:45,229
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to get away with it.

677
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:49,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, you know, if it's multiplayer and online demo, there's going to be a lot of people that are down for that.

678
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:53,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they probably do have room to get away with charging for that.

679
00:48:53,754 --> 00:48:55,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

680
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:55,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll see.

681
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:57,195
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

682
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:58,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you pay for a Halo 3 demo?

683
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:00,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

684
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:01,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends on how much it is.

685
00:49:01,717 --> 00:49:02,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be nice.

686
00:49:02,218 --> 00:49:03,878
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's like five bucks, I'm not paying for that.

687
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:12,643
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, and also, I'm not really a good indicator of whether you'd pay for it or not because I would probably buy just to report on it for the show.

688
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.

689
00:49:13,123 --> 00:49:13,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

690
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:17,761
[SPEAKER_06]: You know... Okay, with the gamer in you, the regular gamer, non-journalist in you.

691
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:18,182
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

692
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:18,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

693
00:49:18,762 --> 00:49:21,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't pay for it because, you know, to be honest, I never played it.

694
00:49:21,604 --> 00:49:23,685
[SPEAKER_06]: What if it... Now, here's a good idea that might justify that.

695
00:49:23,745 --> 00:49:29,469
[SPEAKER_06]: What if it came with those little pictures or themes or something, came with it, like to maybe sweeten the deal?

696
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:29,849
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

697
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:30,309
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

698
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:31,670
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wouldn't do that.

699
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I would do.

700
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I subscribe to Xbox Magazine, and let me get this straight.

701
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:41,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Magazine, they used to come with demos that you couldn't find on Xbox Live.

702
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:42,771
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

703
00:50:11,205 --> 00:50:12,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting comments from our chatroom.

704
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:17,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Bandit says they should not charge for the demo, but should charge for the opportunity to play multiplayer in the demo.

705
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:23,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, because servers cost money to maintain, I guess, although no other multiplayer demos have been charged as of yet.

706
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:24,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

707
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,438
[SPEAKER_06]: ShadowNextGen makes it very clear.

708
00:50:26,518 --> 00:50:27,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not paying for a demo.

709
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't doing it.

710
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:30,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

711
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:34,505
[SPEAKER_06]: VidPower says Halo 3 will be microtransactions.

712
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:36,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Spend 400 points to get the sniper rifle.

713
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I hope not.

714
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:40,625
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

715
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,760
[SPEAKER_06]: but some people don't, you know.

716
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're arbitrarily picking a weapon here.

717
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:07,744
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't mean that that's actually going to happen, but I just hope they use caution in the microtransactions.

718
00:51:08,144 --> 00:51:11,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe learning a little bit from this luminous backlash that's going on, so.

719
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:12,367
[SPEAKER_06]: What about EA?

720
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:14,368
[SPEAKER_06]: JeremyTodd1 has a very interesting point.

721
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:19,791
[SPEAKER_06]: People who don't have their 360 connected to live will find the OXM's demo very useful.

722
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:26,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people that play Halo don't play it on live because it does have a very thorough story mode in it, so something to think about.

723
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:27,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

724
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:32,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway, one other story about the 360.

725
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,432
[SPEAKER_06]: It's possible that there's going to be a dashboard update this week.

726
00:51:36,144 --> 00:51:42,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is speculation, but the speculation is coming from something Major Nelson said in his latest podcast.

727
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:48,667
[SPEAKER_06]: He was talking to a developer on the show, and basically they were talking about the wireless communicator that's coming out very soon.

728
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:51,648
[SPEAKER_06]: The wireless communicator is scheduled to come out October 31st.

729
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:58,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Major Nelson said, you know, if you were to go to the store today and buy it, you can't use it until the fall upgrade to the dashboard.

730
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:03,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then that gets people thinking, okay, so he's saying that if, because this came out last week, this podcast,

731
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:04,982
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

732
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:23,504
[SPEAKER_05]: They would need to put it out beforehand.

733
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:32,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's about the time to do that anyways, because you're going to want to have the dashboard update ready for the 7th when the HD DVD player comes out.

734
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:39,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to want to have the update ready for when the PlayStation 3 comes out, so you have that 1080p and you can compete with them.

735
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And whatever other fun stuff they want to throw in there.

736
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:44,884
[SPEAKER_05]: More backwards compatibility, maybe.

737
00:52:45,124 --> 00:52:46,866
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, hey, maybe 2K.

738
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:47,553
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

739
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:38,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Major Nelson seems like a really great guy I've never met him in person I will turn this dashboard update around if you do not behave but if you read those comments on his board and you know it's getting to him because he's had to make some changes I'd be so annoyed too alright, anyway

740
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:51,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something that may annoy other people in regards to Microsoft is that there's actually indications that they favor the live gold accounts above the platinum ones.

741
00:53:51,024 --> 00:53:52,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, over the silver?

742
00:53:52,986 --> 00:53:53,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the silver.

743
00:53:53,827 --> 00:53:54,267
[SPEAKER_05]: They should.

744
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:55,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm paying for it.

745
00:53:56,389 --> 00:54:02,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, basically, they're saying that, especially for some of the...

746
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:09,089
[SPEAKER_03]: The demos that are coming out, they're releasing them to the gold accounts before they're releasing them to the silver.

747
00:54:09,689 --> 00:54:18,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll get the newer trailers, the newer demos, instead of having to wait for them because they're releasing them about a week or so afterwards.

748
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:19,453
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

749
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:24,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's perfect because it's more incentive to go play on gold.

750
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:26,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

751
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:27,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's free.

752
00:54:27,856 --> 00:54:29,917
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't complain if you're getting demos later on.

753
00:54:30,357 --> 00:54:30,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Just

754
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:35,832
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're paying $50 for your year subscription, you should be getting your stuff.

755
00:54:36,092 --> 00:54:36,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

756
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:38,134
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have some sort of perks.

757
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:42,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised there hasn't really been much more other than this.

758
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:50,809
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, then if you've got the silver, if you want them at the same time, they should do some sort of pay-by-download for...

759
00:54:52,461 --> 00:54:56,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're going to come out of nowhere and say, surprise, you're going to have to pay for this.

760
00:54:56,143 --> 00:54:57,504
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to piss more people off with that.

761
00:54:57,524 --> 00:55:00,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sony is in a corner now where they have to make it free.

762
00:55:20,643 --> 00:55:24,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they have that comparison chart that got them in a lot of trouble?

763
00:55:24,726 --> 00:55:28,008
[SPEAKER_06]: That was comparing the Sony PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360.

764
00:55:28,048 --> 00:55:31,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was talking about like, hey, this comes with it.

765
00:55:32,151 --> 00:55:36,014
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically trying to show the Xbox 360 actually costs more than the PlayStation 3.

766
00:55:36,774 --> 00:55:37,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It was that comparison.

767
00:55:37,675 --> 00:55:39,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things was they were talking about Play Online.

768
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:41,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was free on PlayStation 3.

769
00:55:41,697 --> 00:55:45,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm pretty sure it's going to be... Well, 15 a month, though, it's not that expensive.

770
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,221
[SPEAKER_03]: You're technically paying about...

771
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:50,004
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

772
00:55:59,258 --> 00:56:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about it in the big picture, you really are not paying all that much for your subscription cost for live.

773
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,340
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple quick comments in chat.

774
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:09,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Blaze says, good, if I'm paying $50 a year, I should get it earlier.

775
00:56:10,282 --> 00:56:17,564
[SPEAKER_06]: JeremyTao1 says, I'd rather pay $50 a year for live, which has a lot more neat features than have the free PS3 online service and it having not as many features.

776
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:19,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So interesting point there as well.

777
00:56:19,265 --> 00:56:19,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay for what you get.

778
00:56:21,306 --> 00:56:24,367
[SPEAKER_06]: ShadowNextGen agrees, $50 a year for Xbox Live is a great value.

779
00:56:24,387 --> 00:56:25,647
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

780
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:26,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

781
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:28,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

782
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:30,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Spiker, Brute Weapon

783
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:59,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Spartan Laser that apparently tears vehicles apart, and a nail grenade which sticks in the walls and sends nails everywhere.

784
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:06,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Brand new vehicles like the Mongoose, which is like a miniature ATV for two passengers with no weapons on it.

785
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:17,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the one that people are hoping is mistranslated, but the Man Cannon, which launches players into the air, kind of like jump pads in Unreal or Quaker Arena.

786
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:21,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Come step in suit, would you want to see my, uh, man-cannon?

787
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:22,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Man-cannon.

788
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:23,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the man-cannon.

789
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:46,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other interesting stuff is it's going to be coming out in three different SKUs.

790
00:57:47,428 --> 00:58:02,113
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one's game only, second one will be a collector's edition, and the third one is the legendary edition, which includes a replica of Master Chief's helmet, which is miniaturizing, so it's about cat size, so you can put it on your cat.

791
00:58:02,473 --> 00:58:03,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Or your man cannon.

792
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:04,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Or man cannon.

793
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:11,162
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also going to include documentaries, developer commentary, spin-off material like Red vs. Blue, Spark of Life, etc.

794
00:58:12,263 --> 00:58:16,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the cutscenes from Halo 1 through 3 in HD on a separate disc.

795
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:16,907
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

796
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:18,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe a sneak peek at the Halo movie.

797
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:20,029
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just speculating right now.

798
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,791
[SPEAKER_05]: But lots of screenshots.

799
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:22,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks very pretty.

800
00:58:23,312 --> 00:58:24,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very pretty.

801
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:29,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, also coming out at the same time, not to be outdone by this leaked information...

802
00:58:30,453 --> 00:58:35,175
[SPEAKER_05]: OneUp had to mention that EGM will be also having some content on Halo 3.

803
00:58:35,235 --> 00:58:37,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, buy our magazine too.

804
00:58:37,216 --> 00:58:43,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the looks of their content, almost identical to what is in that Swedish magazine.

805
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, so that'll be coming.

806
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:50,001
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, they're going to be doing three weeks of coverage for Halo 3.

807
00:58:52,081 --> 00:58:55,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought usually you did that leading up to a game's release.

808
00:58:56,543 --> 00:58:58,284
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just randomly, hey, folks...

809
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:00,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Three weeks of Halo 3 stuff.

810
00:59:00,152 --> 00:59:00,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

811
00:59:00,753 --> 00:59:00,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

812
00:59:01,173 --> 00:59:02,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then... Okay.

813
00:59:02,813 --> 00:59:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: That's... That's what you want to do.

814
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:09,835
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole Man Cannon thing reminds me of when we were playing Fear last night.

815
00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:12,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a weapon in there called the Penetrator.

816
00:59:14,016 --> 00:59:18,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So... If that gives you any indication.

817
00:59:18,257 --> 00:59:19,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Anyway.

818
00:59:20,297 --> 00:59:20,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

819
00:59:20,998 --> 00:59:24,738
[SPEAKER_06]: PooEater says, Okay, so I'm guessing Man Cannon will be the next joke we run into the ground.

820
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:25,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely.

821
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:25,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely.

822
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:26,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

823
00:59:27,475 --> 00:59:33,460
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Morpheus asks, hello, by the way, to our good buddy DJ Morpheus, honestly, who really looks at the developer extras?

824
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:35,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I do!

825
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:37,963
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on the game.

826
00:59:38,544 --> 00:59:41,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't buy this Halo 3 Uber Edition or whatever.

827
00:59:41,226 --> 00:59:42,247
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too much crap.

828
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:45,229
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know people who love their Halo.

829
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I might do that just to put a Halo helmet in my cube.

830
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a lot of game memorabilia, and that might be kind of fun.

831
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to see what it looks like.

832
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,981
[SPEAKER_05]: If it looks retarded, I'm not buying it.

833
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:58,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I actually love seeing all of the behind-the-scenes stuff.

834
00:59:58,482 --> 01:00:05,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Being in a design major myself, I love seeing all the artistic elements that go behind it.

835
01:00:05,804 --> 01:00:13,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we got the Toy Story box set, I was watching all the rendering errors first, before I was even watching the movies, because I'm just into all that kind of stuff.

836
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:14,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.

837
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the ones in Shrek where the donkey turns into a big fuzzy porcupine looking thing.

838
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:24,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I personally wouldn't mind buying the extra stuff.

839
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:31,551
[SPEAKER_00]: For Company of Heroes, which is an RTS game for the PC, they had just the regular edition and they had the special silver edition.

840
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:37,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the special silver edition, it had a DVD with special features of how they...

841
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,636
[SPEAKER_00]: made the storyline, the people they interviewed.

842
01:00:40,676 --> 01:00:51,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And it even came with little flashcards so that you can see what type of tanks you were fighting and what were some of their names and some of the weak spots and everything.

843
01:00:52,003 --> 01:00:52,864
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty interesting.

844
01:00:53,444 --> 01:00:53,684
Huh.

845
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:54,785
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

846
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:57,086
[SPEAKER_00]: For those people who love World War II.

847
01:00:57,287 --> 01:01:02,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting the collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII so I can watch all the extras that are going to be there.

848
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I probably will watch them because I'm sad.

849
01:01:09,557 --> 01:01:11,698
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another game I believe has a collector's edition.

850
01:01:11,738 --> 01:01:13,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Gears of War has a collector's edition coming out.

851
01:01:13,998 --> 01:01:16,099
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, Gears of War has gone gold-ish.

852
01:01:16,879 --> 01:01:18,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It has gone officially gold, too.

853
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's gold.

854
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Cliffy B says, my job as designer of Gears of War is, well, more or less done.

855
01:01:26,022 --> 01:01:27,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was coming from his official blog.

856
01:01:27,963 --> 01:01:30,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So it does look like Gears of War is going to make it out there on time.

857
01:01:30,723 --> 01:01:35,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it was actually, I think, later on that week also, it was also officially gold.

858
01:01:36,604 --> 01:01:40,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe Major Nelson kind of dropped that bomb a little later, I think, from what I'm reading.

859
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:42,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're all ready to go.

860
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:44,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the game will be out on time.

861
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't look like any delays are going to happen unless something really screws up.

862
01:01:47,153 --> 01:01:51,936
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's exciting, because for the Halo 3 folks, this is a real hold-em-over game.

863
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:54,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Even for non-Halo people, maybe this is something.

864
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:55,879
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really cool looking.

865
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:05,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hope there's a demo on Marketplace so I can check it out, because it looked really cool at E3, but watching and playing are two very, very different things.

866
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:05,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm buying it.

867
01:02:07,573 --> 01:02:09,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe I'll borrow yours then, check it out first.

868
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think I won it, though, but, you know, after Final Fantasy XII is beaten.

869
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not getting Final Fantasy XII, though.

870
01:02:16,658 --> 01:02:17,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I'm going to say this.

871
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:18,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a very, very good boy.

872
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:21,360
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a... I'm okay to say this.

873
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:26,803
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a pirated copy of Final Fantasy XII sitting on the floor of my living room right now, and I haven't touched it.

874
01:02:27,383 --> 01:02:30,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm being good, and I'm being a very good boy.

875
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:34,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's kind of on someone else's PlayStation's hard drive, so I can't really give that away.

876
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:35,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to name names, but...

877
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:37,710
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

878
01:02:58,315 --> 01:02:59,916
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm tempted to take a camera.

879
01:02:59,936 --> 01:03:01,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Does somebody want to go with me late tomorrow?

880
01:03:01,496 --> 01:03:02,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go with you if you get me a copy.

881
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:03,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a video camera?

882
01:03:03,857 --> 01:03:04,017
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

883
01:03:04,037 --> 01:03:09,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to buy you that game after you bashed on it on this program saying you hate the battle system.

884
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:10,699
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kiss my butt.

885
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, actually, actually, actually, there are things about that game that make me want it, but I'm still so busy.

886
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I really am getting into PSU now.

887
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:20,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But you let me make a game on my memory card.

888
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:20,702
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

889
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:21,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So I play over here.

890
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:25,223
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStuffs have had Final Fantasy XII since like Friday, by the way.

891
01:03:25,263 --> 01:03:28,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so did CompUSA, but they put them all out on the shelves from what I hear.

892
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,386
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm being good and I'm waiting.

893
01:03:31,127 --> 01:03:32,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Does somebody want to come?

894
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:34,449
[SPEAKER_06]: We could take a video camera and do something for YouTube.

895
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:35,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go with you.

896
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:36,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

897
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:37,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to work on Tuesday.

898
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:37,770
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

899
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:40,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I do too, but hey, staying up late might be fun.

900
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:49,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of things, though, that are kind of messed up, you know, they broke a particular Walmart in Arkansas broke street date for Guitar Hero 2.

901
01:03:50,883 --> 01:03:52,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually reported on.

902
01:03:52,865 --> 01:04:02,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So since it's actually supposed to be released on November 7th and Walmart said, uh-uh, we're releasing it now, then maybe your local Walmart will have it.

903
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:07,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually sort of thinking about making a run by Walmart just because I have to play Trogdor.

904
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:10,346
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know...

905
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:14,012
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of a, well, it's a related story.

906
01:04:14,112 --> 01:04:21,653
[SPEAKER_05]: You know you can actually hack the demo to play the songs that were unlocked in the game.

907
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:23,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they were on the demo disc.

908
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:25,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to go, programmers!

909
01:04:26,014 --> 01:04:26,614
[SPEAKER_05]: You rock!

910
01:04:26,894 --> 01:04:28,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeping that content on disc.

911
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:30,234
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how hot coffee happens.

912
01:04:30,835 --> 01:04:33,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so yeah, apparently you can hack the demo.

913
01:04:33,795 --> 01:04:35,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the demo at my house.

914
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to see what's what.

915
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:42,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I am actually passing on Guitar Hero 2 until the 360 version I sold my Guitar Hero today Wow I'm gonna probably get both

916
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:13,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as much as I really enjoy Red Octane and so forth, I actually really like Guitar Freaks, and that's where my allegiance goes to.

917
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,932
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to Konami, I'm sorry.

918
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:16,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

919
01:05:16,893 --> 01:05:19,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I would say you're a little bit in the minority there.

920
01:05:19,574 --> 01:05:21,835
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people don't really prefer Guitar Freaks.

921
01:05:21,855 --> 01:05:22,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I think...

922
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:25,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it just depends on your taste in music, too.

923
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:30,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, would you say you like to listen to that Japanese rock and the stuff that's usually in those games?

924
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:31,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, definitely.

925
01:05:31,948 --> 01:05:34,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably why you prefer Guitar Freaks in the end.

926
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:35,608
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is about the music.

927
01:05:35,668 --> 01:05:41,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not have been as excited about Guitar Hero 2 if it wasn't that they put bass mode in it, which I always do on Guitar Freaks.

928
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Same here.

929
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:49,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good thing, though, that I actually will still prefer Guitar Freaks over Guitar Hero 4 is because I've got Dromania and I've got a controller.

930
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all about putting it in session mode.

931
01:05:53,307 --> 01:05:55,770
[SPEAKER_03]: and just go and add it when you've got a group of people.

932
01:05:56,611 --> 01:06:01,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad Keyboard Mania wouldn't link, but that's still... It's not that I dislike Guitar Hero.

933
01:06:01,716 --> 01:06:04,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do want to play Guitar Hero 2, but now is just such a bad time.

934
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:05,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hate Christmas.

935
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:10,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it and I hate it because they just avalanche the games on us at this period.

936
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:11,085
[SPEAKER_03]: To some people, it's Yule.

937
01:06:11,786 --> 01:06:12,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, whatever.

938
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:13,067
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean.

939
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:14,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate.

940
01:06:16,629 --> 01:06:20,090
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just this avalanche of games right now, and I can't play them all.

941
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:27,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So I might as well just wait for the 360 version, which will have better graphics, widescreen, and maybe some extra songs.

942
01:06:27,132 --> 01:06:27,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

943
01:06:27,472 --> 01:06:28,052
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll wait and see.

944
01:06:28,432 --> 01:06:29,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll play it then.

945
01:06:29,372 --> 01:06:30,552
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come play at my house.

946
01:06:31,713 --> 01:06:32,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I will play.

947
01:06:32,593 --> 01:06:33,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like I played pinball this week.

948
01:06:33,713 --> 01:06:34,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to say in my gaming week.

949
01:06:34,793 --> 01:06:35,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally got to play one at the table.

950
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:36,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Play Guns N' Roses.

951
01:06:36,814 --> 01:06:37,154
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

952
01:06:37,214 --> 01:06:38,594
[SPEAKER_02]: My, my, my, my show.

953
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:43,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because I hate you, Michelle!

954
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:45,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hate Christmas.

955
01:06:45,212 --> 01:06:46,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are the chatters saying I hate Christmas?

956
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hate Christmas.

957
01:06:48,633 --> 01:06:50,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate you for saying I hate Christmas.

958
01:06:50,934 --> 01:07:05,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, the full track list has been out for a little bit now, including such wonderful tracks as we mentioned, Strong Bad, Trogdor, The Burninator, Homestar Runner, Flash Animation,

959
01:07:09,754 --> 01:07:21,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you happen to be a fan of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, you might recognize this band Deathlock as they perform their hit Thunder Horse.

960
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:30,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course Deathlock is from Metalock plus the wonderful, very violent show on Adult Swim.

961
01:07:30,722 --> 01:07:32,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they had that on the E3 demo, didn't they?

962
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

963
01:07:34,824 --> 01:07:35,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I remembered hearing it.

964
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, some other stuff that they've got coming out.

965
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:44,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe a new Freeze Pops, or another Freeze Pops song on there, Less Talk, More Rock.

966
01:07:45,081 --> 01:07:45,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, Freeze Pop.

967
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:51,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And some other stuff, and just a bunch of bands I've never heard of.

968
01:07:51,723 --> 01:07:55,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Honest Bob and the Factory to Deals Incentive.

969
01:07:55,943 --> 01:08:00,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, these are all, you know, the indie bands that they put in there, too, which is kind of cool.

970
01:08:00,724 --> 01:08:05,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's pretty cool, and lots of tracks, so definitely worth picking up if you have a guitar.

971
01:08:05,725 --> 01:08:06,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, so I won't.

972
01:08:07,162 --> 01:08:08,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can buy the bundle.

973
01:08:09,223 --> 01:08:09,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I do that?

974
01:08:09,764 --> 01:08:10,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I just sold back the guitar.

975
01:08:11,284 --> 01:08:13,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for the 360 one.

976
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:14,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a big mistake.

977
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:19,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you announce the 360 one before the... Because we'd be so pissed if they announced it after.

978
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:23,431
[SPEAKER_06]: You would be pissed and I would be pissed and we'd be on this show yelling and bitching.

979
01:08:24,372 --> 01:08:25,312
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'd buy it anyways.

980
01:08:25,553 --> 01:08:26,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

981
01:08:27,694 --> 01:08:30,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's talk about... I almost said Guitar Freaks 2.

982
01:08:30,195 --> 01:08:31,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero 2 is coming out.

983
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:34,157
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360's Platinum Collection

984
01:08:44,816 --> 01:08:50,621
[SPEAKER_06]: 99 Nights, Project Gotham Racing 3, Rumble Roses XX, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and Every Party.

985
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:56,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, another Xbox 360 system is coming out.

986
01:08:56,247 --> 01:09:01,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of their, you know, they talked about this earlier, they're going to release kind of a reduced bundle in Japan.

987
01:09:01,211 --> 01:09:04,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is out this week, Xbox Live Vision making its debut as well.

988
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:08,938
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you holding out on the PlayStation 2, lots of fans still about the PS2.

989
01:09:09,018 --> 01:09:12,540
[SPEAKER_06]: In Japan, you can get LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.

990
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:18,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out, Slaughter Up Core 9 and Gallop Racer Inbreed.

991
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:21,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll leave it to you to figure out what that is.

992
01:09:21,826 --> 01:09:24,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to point out, this one gives us this bot.

993
01:09:24,608 --> 01:09:28,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Horses with extra holds on their... That's how they translate it, folks.

994
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:29,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

995
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:35,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, I'm looking here at this game, the Slaughter Upcore 9.

996
01:09:35,086 --> 01:09:36,927
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it has a go-go dancer on the front there.

997
01:09:36,947 --> 01:09:40,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a gambling simulator, so it has a little go-go girl on the front there.

998
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, let me look at the box art here for this Gallop Racer.

999
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks like a, it says it right there on the box.

1000
01:09:46,632 --> 01:09:48,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this, here it is, right there in the studio.

1001
01:09:48,413 --> 01:09:50,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Gallop Racer inbreed, right there, 10th anniversary.

1002
01:09:52,535 --> 01:09:57,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but is that like, is that kind of like... If you're an inbred horse, you probably are going to gallop everywhere.

1003
01:09:57,297 --> 01:09:58,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Mississippi horse!

1004
01:10:00,257 --> 01:10:01,358
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1005
01:10:25,444 --> 01:10:27,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a strategy game by Digital Kids.

1006
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,366
[SPEAKER_06]: And just look at the box.

1007
01:10:28,587 --> 01:10:29,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the box.

1008
01:10:29,527 --> 01:10:31,108
[SPEAKER_06]: How could you not love that hamster?

1009
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:33,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the love hamster.

1010
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:37,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to import love hamster.

1011
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:39,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I have dwarf hamsters myself.

1012
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:45,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's anything like real hamsters, then they probably should rename it to hamster inbreeding.

1013
01:10:48,522 --> 01:10:50,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they multiply like crazy.

1014
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:53,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Now just keep in mind, please keep your love hamsters away from your man cannons, okay?

1015
01:10:54,307 --> 01:10:54,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Boys and girls.

1016
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:56,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

1017
01:10:56,582 --> 01:11:00,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my brain is now swimming from love hamsters.

1018
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:08,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways, for our UK friends, we've got a number of things coming out.

[SPEAKER_03]: Neverwinter Nights 2 on PC, Rule of Rose on PlayStation 2, Scooby-Doo Who's Watching Who on a number of things, and SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the Krusty Krab.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1025
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:39,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on PC.

1026
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,224
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things, though, that should be made a mention of.

1027
01:11:45,765 --> 01:11:47,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me if I can never get my voice to work again.

1028
01:11:49,551 --> 01:12:16,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and list some of them for the 6th because there's actually the biggest one coming out will be Phantasy Star Universe coming out on the 6th of November other things to look forward to within the month actually after having played the demo is WWE Smackdown vs. Raw it's actually really good and if you want to beat everybody use Kane okay anyways I don't speak wrestling sorry yeah

1029
01:12:19,581 --> 01:12:23,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, each week we like to talk about some stuff that you may not have heard yet.

1030
01:12:24,385 --> 01:12:30,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And this week, of course, I'm going to start things off with a few date changes and a few price reductions like normal.

1031
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:34,053
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, the Xbox 360 games have dropped in price this week.

1032
01:12:34,374 --> 01:12:37,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 dropped down to $49.99, which is good.

1033
01:12:37,957 --> 01:12:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Battlefield 2 also dropped down to $49.99.

1034
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,483
[SPEAKER_05]: NCAA Football 07, which hasn't been out that long, dropped down to $49.99.

1035
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout Revenge, which was already cheap to begin with, $29.99.

1036
01:12:50,187 --> 01:12:54,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I think all Xbox 360 games should drop to $49.99, a more reasonable price, don't you?

1037
01:12:55,049 --> 01:13:01,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, pretty awesome game, dropped down to $39.99, so that's pretty cool.

1038
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:12,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, if you don't have a 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox Madden dropped down $39.99, and the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on PlayStation 2 and Xbox dropped down to $19.99, so not bad.

1039
01:13:15,535 --> 01:13:16,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Now some date changes.

1040
01:13:17,077 --> 01:13:18,178
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting.

1041
01:13:18,198 --> 01:13:22,802
[SPEAKER_05]: A few things you might not have heard yet, including some of the Wii launch titles have been delayed.

1042
01:13:24,794 --> 01:13:25,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite interesting.

1043
01:13:26,075 --> 01:13:30,856
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Blazing Angels on the Wii has been delayed to December 6th.

1044
01:13:31,977 --> 01:13:38,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Far Cry Instinct's Predator has been delayed to next year, January 16th, which is very interesting.

1045
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Wii has been delayed to December 7th.

1046
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:46,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 3 has also been delayed to December 7th.

1047
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:49,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And Marvel Ultimate Alliance, December 7th.

1048
01:13:49,704 --> 01:13:49,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1049
01:13:51,144 --> 01:13:54,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision, something happened there because all their titles got delayed.

1050
01:13:55,689 --> 01:14:04,137
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking for Elder Scrolls Oblivion on the PS3, I mentioned it was a launch title, but of course that's the launch window and not launch day.

1051
01:14:04,998 --> 01:14:11,083
[SPEAKER_05]: December 12th, it's already starting its move into March, kind of like the 360 version was.

1052
01:14:12,385 --> 01:14:12,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1053
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:14,573
[SPEAKER_05]: It's slowly sneaking away.

1054
01:14:14,893 --> 01:14:20,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, some other games, though, you might also be looking forward to, especially not on the PlayStation 3, but on the 360.

1055
01:14:21,778 --> 01:14:24,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Fusion Frenzy 2 won't be coming out this year.

1056
01:14:24,139 --> 01:14:28,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out January 16th of next year.

1057
01:14:29,422 --> 01:14:32,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Some games also announced Warriors on the PSP.

1058
01:14:32,785 --> 01:14:34,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out December 13th.

1059
01:14:35,026 --> 01:14:37,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill Origins also been delayed to next year.

1060
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:43,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So you won't be seeing that until at least January 17th.

1061
01:14:43,932 --> 01:14:47,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say I read somewhere there's some major reworking going on there, which is why it was delayed.

1062
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,379
[SPEAKER_05]: That date has been bouncing around this week like crazy.

1063
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,261
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in March at one time this week.

1064
01:14:52,441 --> 01:14:53,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nuts.

1065
01:14:53,582 --> 01:15:01,530
[SPEAKER_03]: One point, though, about that is that if you go in the Akira Yamaoka community on LiveJournal, there's actually previews to some of the tracks in the game.

1066
01:15:02,511 --> 01:15:02,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1067
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:10,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, two other titles were announced from Buena Vista Interactive that you haven't heard about yet on systems.

1068
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:13,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Pirates of the Caribbean 3, of course, that's a working title.

1069
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:22,335
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3, the Wii, Xbox 360, DS, and PSP May 16th of next year.

1070
01:15:22,955 --> 01:15:25,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And, God, why are they making this game?

1071
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:31,799
[SPEAKER_05]: High School Musical The Game is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and the DS on July 11th.

1072
01:15:32,827 --> 01:15:36,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are your dates for the week for exclusive stuff.

1073
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:43,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quickly, Footy Monsters, Diane in chat here wants to know, you know the release date for Splinter Cell Double Agent on PS2?

1074
01:15:45,557 --> 01:15:46,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Splinter Cell Double Agent?

1075
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,080
[SPEAKER_05]: For the US?

1076
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:48,760
[SPEAKER_06]: PS2, yeah.

1077
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:52,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually last week.

1078
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:52,763
[SPEAKER_05]: For PS2?

1079
01:15:53,104 --> 01:15:55,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it came out a week after the 360.

1080
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:57,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was last week.

1081
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:05,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, um, some other stuff, of course, you know, the releases for this week, um, we've got lots of big stuff.

1082
01:16:05,303 --> 01:16:11,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is kind of getting into the whole, um, you know, kind of end of the year push.

1083
01:16:12,546 --> 01:16:18,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Need for Speed Carbon on pretty much every single system out there except for the PlayStation 3 and Wii, because those are coming out a little bit later.

1084
01:16:19,148 --> 01:16:25,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, of course, you've got Children of Mana on the DS, Pokemon Ranger on the DS, um,

1085
01:16:27,022 --> 01:16:33,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII

1086
01:16:52,172 --> 01:17:02,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Death Junior, Root of Evil, Killzone Liberation, Mind Quiz, and Power Stone Collection.

1087
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:07,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a little slice of the stuff coming out.

1088
01:17:08,048 --> 01:17:08,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everything, of course.

1089
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1090
01:17:09,944 --> 01:17:22,076
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as things coming out much later, it was actually listed in the official Xbox 360 magazine that Bethesda is working on a game that uses the Unreal Engine 3 called Rogue Warrior.

1091
01:17:22,296 --> 01:17:24,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 3.

1092
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:29,603
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a multiplayer anti-terrorism game.

1093
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:32,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually based on books by Richard Marcinko.

1094
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:33,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's how it's pronounced.

1095
01:17:34,565 --> 01:17:36,347
[SPEAKER_03]: and being developed by Zombie Studios.

1096
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:38,488
[SPEAKER_03]: They worked on Shadow Ops prior.

1097
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:47,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to have some different modes, including one that generates a map based on what the teams decide on beforehand, like a cooperative map.

1098
01:17:49,476 --> 01:17:52,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're the only one who will know the territory you start off in.

1099
01:17:53,759 --> 01:17:58,662
[SPEAKER_03]: It also has a four-player co-op mode, 24 and other multiplayer modes.

1100
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds pretty cool, actually.

1101
01:18:03,895 --> 01:18:05,957
[SPEAKER_03]: if you like, you know, those types of games.

1102
01:18:06,497 --> 01:18:06,797
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1103
01:18:07,678 --> 01:18:09,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have a... I like Bethesda.

1104
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like Bethesda, too.

1105
01:18:11,361 --> 01:18:14,203
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a series of oopsie things to report.

1106
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:15,284
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot of oopsies.

1107
01:18:15,604 --> 01:18:19,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember last week, the big, big oopsie with Bubble Bobble on the DS?

1108
01:18:19,307 --> 01:18:19,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Oopsie.

1109
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:20,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't get past stage 30?

1110
01:18:21,108 --> 01:18:24,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, nothing quite that major, but a couple big oopsies nonetheless.

1111
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:31,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody noticed just now that, I believe this was on NeoGAF, those big forums over there,

1112
01:18:32,118 --> 01:18:42,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Notice that the GameCube Killer7 box, if you look at the back, it points you to a website, www.killer7.com.

1113
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:45,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Killer7.com is a porno site.

1114
01:18:45,844 --> 01:18:50,326
[SPEAKER_06]: The correct site should have been killer-7.com.

1115
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to killer7.com right now, Loki?

1116
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:53,787
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

1117
01:18:54,908 --> 01:18:57,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone is sending me a private message.

1118
01:18:57,369 --> 01:18:59,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I saw him reach for the keyboard as I said that.

1119
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:00,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought he was going to check that out right now.

1120
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:07,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, certainly a lot of free publicity for that porno site this week, thanks to Capcom's proofreading team.

1121
01:19:07,357 --> 01:19:08,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, Capcom.

1122
01:19:09,838 --> 01:19:21,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, some other funny oopsies have been going on, like in Glasgow, because apparently Wii's out over there, according to some of their clocks, which have been incorrectly set up.

1123
01:19:21,664 --> 01:19:26,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their countdown clocks that they have for the Wii, and so now it's just saying out now.

1124
01:19:26,467 --> 01:19:29,668
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know, big deal.

1125
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:30,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So someone messed up a clock.

1126
01:19:32,395 --> 01:19:38,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing to put on the internet, you know, like, hey, somebody can't set a clock, that's gaming news.

1127
01:19:40,014 --> 01:19:43,675
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess some folks are curious what it's going to look like when all is said and done.

1128
01:19:44,495 --> 01:19:47,395
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple website oopsies going on right now.

1129
01:19:47,776 --> 01:19:51,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Walmart was listing the PlayStation 3 for $299.82.

1130
01:19:51,696 --> 01:20:02,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind the PlayStation 3 is supposed to cost at least $4.99 for the low one, $5.99 for the high one.

1131
01:20:02,258 --> 01:20:05,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know they do sell a lot of stuff as lost leaders.

1132
01:20:05,799 --> 01:20:08,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I don't think it's supposed to be that low.

1133
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I think someone made a boo-boo.

1134
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolling back prices.

1135
01:20:11,861 --> 01:20:14,142
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like the Xbox 360 price right there.

1136
01:20:15,822 --> 01:20:14,142
$299.82.

1137
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:18,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, a late-breaking oopsie.

1138
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:21,345
[SPEAKER_06]: We got posted to our forums just before the show, I believe.

1139
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:22,645
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw pointed this out.

1140
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:27,187
[SPEAKER_06]: CompUSA was listing a Nintendo Wii for $1,100.

1141
01:20:28,528 --> 01:20:31,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought the Wii was supposed to be the affordable system.

1142
01:20:32,649 --> 01:20:33,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Must be Canadian.

1143
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Needless to say, someone's getting fired!

1144
01:20:38,412 --> 01:20:38,672
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1145
01:20:39,795 --> 01:20:41,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should make this oopsie thing a regular segment.

1146
01:20:41,876 --> 01:20:43,897
[SPEAKER_06]: There certainly are enough mistakes going on out there.

1147
01:20:43,957 --> 01:20:45,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what to say about that.

1148
01:20:47,618 --> 01:20:49,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the Wii thing is still up.

1149
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:51,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claws posted a link in our chat right now.

1150
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:56,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go ahead and do that and I'll paste that in right now.

1151
01:20:56,722 --> 01:20:58,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is wonderful radio here.

1152
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:01,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, there it is.

1153
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:02,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii console, $1,119.06.

1154
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone made a little bit of a mistake there.

1155
01:21:09,636 --> 01:21:10,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, CompUSA.

1156
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:17,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaking games early, selling Wii's for... That's gotta be one hell of a Wii.

1157
01:21:18,088 --> 01:21:20,752
[SPEAKER_03]: It better, like, have other Wii attachments with it.

1158
01:21:21,493 --> 01:21:22,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Madden Cannon.

1159
01:21:23,575 --> 01:21:24,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Penetrator.

1160
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:25,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Love Hamster?

1161
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:37,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and all around, and she finds a website appropriate to share with y'all.

1162
01:21:37,776 --> 01:21:38,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Appropriate.

1163
01:21:38,496 --> 01:21:42,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And she calls, or maybe, is it Killer7.com, your website of the week this week?

1164
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:42,538
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1165
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:42,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1166
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:47,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's got a website of the week, and she's going to share it with you right now.

1167
01:21:51,303 --> 01:21:56,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's website of the week is The Misadventures of Hello Cthulhu.

1168
01:21:57,938 --> 01:22:07,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really messed up little webcomic that one of my friends in the Doctor Who fandom linked to me that's about Cthulhu being dropped in the Hello Kitty universe.

1169
01:22:08,364 --> 01:22:14,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Elder God Cthulhu in the Hello Kitty universe with ribbons on his tentacles.

1170
01:22:15,487 --> 01:22:24,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very funny and I recommend everybody go read it all the way through because trust me, it sort of has continuity but not really because it's just messed up.

1171
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:27,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when he turns...

1172
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:30,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen Bats Maru yet.

1173
01:22:30,308 --> 01:22:31,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Pom Pom Purin.

1174
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:35,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've also seen the Tentacle Monster version of Pom Pom Purin 2.

1175
01:22:58,092 --> 01:23:02,555
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite part is when they go to the island and are attacked by the cheese grater monster.

1176
01:23:04,316 --> 01:23:05,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really random.

1177
01:23:05,196 --> 01:23:10,059
[SPEAKER_03]: If you liked Kawaii Knot, Hello Cthulhu is even worse.

1178
01:23:13,261 --> 01:23:21,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, before we get to the next story, I want to point out that NintendoManiac64 in our chat room noticed that that amount that they were charging for the Wii on CompUSA, $1,119, is the release date of the Wii, 11-19.

1179
01:23:21,745 --> 01:23:21,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1180
01:23:21,965 --> 01:23:22,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Good eyes.

1181
01:23:27,338 --> 01:23:31,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody just screwed up when putting things in their database and put the date where the price goes.

1182
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:32,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops!

1183
01:23:32,842 --> 01:23:35,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And caused panic amongst game bloggers everywhere.

1184
01:23:35,565 --> 01:23:36,005
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you do?

1185
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:41,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is a little bit more news that I have for everybody.

1186
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:47,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that may interest somebody in the room, except I think she already knows about it, is the LocoRoco Halloween demo.

1187
01:23:48,795 --> 01:23:52,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It also comes with a firmware update for the PSP, bringing it to 2.82.

1188
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:52,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1189
01:23:52,498 --> 01:23:52,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1190
01:23:57,768 --> 01:24:09,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, according to our expert friends at Sony, who, again, expert is used very loosely, it has the extras, things that are changed.

1191
01:24:09,816 --> 01:24:11,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We think we've covered all this before.

1192
01:24:11,757 --> 01:24:15,980
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't really need it to play the LocoRoco demo.

1193
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,361
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still play it with 2.71 firmware.

1194
01:24:18,381 --> 01:24:18,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1195
01:24:22,697 --> 01:24:29,419
[SPEAKER_03]: For European gamers, you can download the firmware update from yourpsp.com or you can also use the US one.

1196
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really matter.

1197
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,180
[SPEAKER_03]: The LocoRoco demo is available online.

1198
01:24:33,781 --> 01:24:35,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It also has a US and European version.

1199
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if anyone's going to dress up as a LocoRoco for Halloween.

1200
01:24:38,462 --> 01:24:39,343
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of cute.

1201
01:24:39,403 --> 01:24:39,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not.

1202
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be a pirate.

1203
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:42,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a costume picked out yet.

1204
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I never pick out my costume until the day of Halloween, actually.

1205
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got this long wig.

1206
01:24:48,686 --> 01:24:49,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be a pirate.

1207
01:24:49,766 --> 01:24:49,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Arr.

1208
01:24:50,566 --> 01:24:53,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, by the way, I made a mistake.

1209
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:58,297
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually Blackboy who noticed it first that the CompUSA screw-up.

1210
01:24:58,838 --> 01:25:01,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo Maniac was just the first to type it in all caps, so I saw it.

1211
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to encourage you all in chat to type in all caps, damn you.

1212
01:25:06,855 --> 01:25:13,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, it's getting towards the end of this segment, so that means it's time to hear a little bit of new DDR music.

1213
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:27,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the past eight weeks, if you can believe it, we've been premiering new songs from Dance Dance Revolution Universe, which will be coming out on the Xbox 360, sounds like next year, and DDR Ultramix 4, which I believe is next month?

1214
01:25:27,847 --> 01:25:28,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in November?

1215
01:25:29,028 --> 01:25:29,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe is when it's coming out?

1216
01:25:30,469 --> 01:25:30,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Loki?

1217
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 4 is in November still?

1218
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:36,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Ultramix 4 is November 15th.

1219
01:25:36,262 --> 01:25:36,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Last we heard.

1220
01:25:36,762 --> 01:25:39,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the bundle's delayed a week, which is weird.

1221
01:25:39,163 --> 01:25:40,444
[SPEAKER_05]: They did the same thing with Supernova.

1222
01:25:40,584 --> 01:25:41,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

1223
01:25:42,045 --> 01:25:42,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1224
01:25:42,405 --> 01:25:43,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't make the pads.

1225
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:48,608
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, anyway, we have some new songs for you guys, so you can check out some of the songs you'll be able to dance to in these new games.

1226
01:25:48,988 --> 01:25:52,830
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start off this last batch of songs with a song from DDR Universe.

1227
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:59,573
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a group called Geomancer, and the song is called Hydrasound, and it's going to start off our previews tonight.

1228
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:01,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio

1229
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:15,649
and many more.

1230
01:26:48,696 --> 01:26:49,380
Thanks for watching!

1231
01:27:36,129 --> 01:27:43,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was Hydrasound by Geomancer here on the DDR Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio, coming soon to DDR Universe.

1232
01:27:43,812 --> 01:27:45,132
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go into our next song.

1233
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from DDR Ultramix 4.

1234
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:53,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by an artist called Steve Porter, and the song is called Sockham, and it's coming to DDR Ultramix 4.

1235
01:27:53,096 --> 01:27:53,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1236
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:53,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1237
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:57,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Sockham by Steve Porter here on Orange Lounge Radio DDR Sneak Peeks coming soon to DDR Ultramix 4 Alright, we're getting down to the end here and we have our last song we're going to preview here from DDR Universe and it's from an artist you might have recognized from the Ultramix series because this artist showed up in quite a few of the games or if is has a song in DDR Universe and it's called The Hop and you're going to hear it right now on the DDR Sneak Peeks here on Orange Lounge Radio

1238
01:31:31,758 --> 01:31:35,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if it is, they're with The Hop, coming soon to DDR Universe.

1239
01:31:36,059 --> 01:31:39,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, the very last song of our DDR previews.

1240
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:48,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And before we get to this, I just want to say a big thanks to Konami of Hawaii for giving us the opportunity to give you guys something a little bit special here, obviously.

1241
01:31:48,802 --> 01:31:56,103
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, you know that we've always been long-time supporters of music-based games, and of course DDR being at the forefront of that.

1242
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,404
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very cool that Konami...

1243
01:31:58,871 --> 01:31:59,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I made it up!

1244
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:24,391
[SPEAKER_06]: This band's a lot less emo.

1245
01:32:24,432 --> 01:32:25,873
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on the different drum label.

1246
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:30,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a song called Free, the Liberation Mix, and it's coming to DDR Ultramix 4.

1247
01:32:31,179 --> 01:32:31,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1248
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:32,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue October, UK.

1249
01:33:00,723 --> 01:33:14,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Never uttered a word, if I thought out loud in the messages I was always alone, in a world, just the universe and me Never uttered a word, if I thought out loud in the messages We, and I knew this day would come

1250
01:34:08,663 --> 01:34:16,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Breathe, Liberation Mix by Blue October UK here on Orange Lounge Radio, the last song in our DDR sneak peeks.

1251
01:34:17,128 --> 01:34:20,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

1252
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:23,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So did you guys like those songs?

1253
01:34:23,752 --> 01:34:24,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was pretty good.

1254
01:34:24,513 --> 01:34:25,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked that last one especially.

1255
01:34:25,713 --> 01:34:28,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of light and airy and trancy.

1256
01:34:28,635 --> 01:34:30,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little too trancy.

1257
01:34:30,516 --> 01:34:31,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're not a big trance fan, huh?

1258
01:34:31,797 --> 01:34:34,579
[SPEAKER_06]: But you said you liked the one, what did we play in there?

1259
01:34:34,659 --> 01:34:36,740
[SPEAKER_06]: The Steve Porter one.

1260
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:37,861
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you liked that one, yes?

1261
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:38,481
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura?

1262
01:34:38,945 --> 01:34:39,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1263
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:06,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as far as the DDR sneak previews, I like the Orifice one.

1264
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:13,633
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've actually met Zonk live, and actually, Orifice guy is a producer for Zonk.

1265
01:35:13,653 --> 01:35:15,754
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I really like the Orifice one.

1266
01:35:15,854 --> 01:35:17,655
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really kind of different.

1267
01:35:18,036 --> 01:35:24,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, I have to admit, the songs in the previous games weren't so hot to me, but that one I liked.

1268
01:35:24,439 --> 01:35:26,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see myself really playing that one.

1269
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like Zonk a lot.

1270
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I like their remix of...

1271
01:35:29,811 --> 01:35:31,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Love this feeling that they did previously.

1272
01:35:31,632 --> 01:35:34,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I know it was kind of a controversial song in the community.

1273
01:35:34,514 --> 01:35:35,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks were like, what did they do that song?

1274
01:35:36,236 --> 01:35:36,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But I liked it.

1275
01:35:37,276 --> 01:35:38,137
[SPEAKER_06]: So, pretty cool.

1276
01:35:38,957 --> 01:35:42,700
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we are going to say goodbye for now.

1277
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:54,468
