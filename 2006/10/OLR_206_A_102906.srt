Tonight, October 29th, 2006,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Halo Movie News and Halo 3 tidbits,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sony and UK Importers go to war,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and could custom character creation cause trouble for one gaming company?

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello everybody out there in the land of internet broadcasting and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is episode number 206 for this, October 29th, 2006.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm here to help you through that.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You might know me as Sky.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you're joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-hosts over there in that corner,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've taken a vow of silence for five seconds.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Great, then I'll introduce Loki.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I give up.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How are you doing? Seriously though, Jamie?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Head.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You have a little headache?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Little.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It was a migraine earlier, but I feel a lot better now.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm very hyper thanks to my coffee.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh goody, we have a hyper Jamie tonight.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That always makes for a fun show.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And you forgot.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When are we going to set that thing on fire?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nine.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How you doing?

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Good.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How'd the move go?

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It went good.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm just, you know, without internet until tomorrow.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's got to stink.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Not really, because I just play, well actually it's been so busy with unpacking, you know,

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
last minute apartment stuff and all that stuff.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Really haven't had a chance to like sit down.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,240
But I have been stealing my neighbor's wireless, but it only seems to work for about five minutes

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
at a time.

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,520
So, you know, I get on there real quickly and read, you know, news and try to check

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,080
my email and that doesn't always work.

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,400
Have you tried to look at the shared folders on the network to see if there's like porn?

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,760
Actually, her network is unsecured, but her shared folders are password protected.

50
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Interesting.

51
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,000
So, they got it halfway right.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Not that we endorse stealing Wi-Fi, but hey, if you're going to leave it open, people might

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
use it.

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
All right.

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,680
We have a special guest for this tonight, and this is nice because we actually have

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
someone who I believe has never been on the program before.

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,280
So it's nice to have some new blood on the show once in a while.

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
So say hello everyone to Renee.

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Yay.

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Hi.

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm here.

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
How you doing Renee?

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm good.

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
Don't be afraid to just put that mic right up to your mic because they're not that sensitive

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
unfortunately.

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
All right.

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
This is better.

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,960
Their emotions are sensitive though, so don't make fun of them.

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,160
We just want to make sure they can all hear you.

70
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
All right.

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
So you've been a listener of Orange Launch for a little while, right?

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Yeah.

73
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Because you've sent us emails before.

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Yes, I have.

75
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,280
And I think I joked previously, like on one of the episodes a few weeks ago, that Renee

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
needs...

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,520
Or I said something about like she needs to come to the show or I'm going to take her

78
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,800
on my trip and I'm going to put her in a box and poke holes in it because I've met Renee

79
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
before.

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,760
Renee and I run into each other at weird places like E3 and the...

81
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,920
Your friend's concert at Final Fantasy.

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
I remember that.

83
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,880
We ran into each other at the very first-year friend's concert in L.A.

84
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,600
But you were here and you brought your box with you, I saw.

85
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Yes, I brought my box.

86
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
It has holes.

87
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,780
Now, kids on the internet who are going to read into that statement, just freaking clean

88
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
up right now.

89
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm going to come over there and wash out your brain with soap.

90
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
All right.

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Anyway.

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
But how are you doing?

93
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Good.

94
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Good.

95
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,640
So what kind of a gamer are you?

96
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,160
What kind of games do you like to play?

97
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,200
What kind of stuff do you like?

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,440
At heart, I am a console gamer, so I've been playing a couple of PC games recently.

99
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:54,040
Actually, last week, I tapped into my tabletop gaming and I was playing some Hero Quest,

100
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
so...

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Wow.

102
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,000
So I guess I like RPGs, rhythm and simulation-type games, puzzles, so...

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Very cool.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,440
The typical gamer girl.

106
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,040
Well, welcome to the program.

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Thank you.

108
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Now, something occurred to me this morning.

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,600
You actually, at one point, worked in the industry a little bit, didn't you?

110
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I still do, actually.

111
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
You do?

112
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Yes, I do.

113
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Really?

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
You used to work at Konami a couple of years ago.

115
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I did.

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I used to work at Konami.

117
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
That's where I actually started off.

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,880
I have been in the DDR community for a while, and that's when I started listening to Orange

119
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,200
Lounge Radio, because that's where all the cool kids went to, they listened to Orange

120
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Lounge.

121
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Love the endorsement.

122
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Love it.

123
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Thank you.

124
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,720
I met Mike Noh, also known as Asian Innovation.

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,080
Best rapper ever.

126
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,960
Not if you have to deal with him rapping at work, I'll tell you that.

127
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,680
No, but his drunken rap's pretty funny.

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,260
Oh my God, it is pretty funny.

129
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,120
And so I met him, and he said, you know, do you like video games?

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm like, yeah.

131
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,600
And he's like, would you like to be a video game tester at Konami?

132
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,320
And I said, sure.

133
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,920
And so that's where I started off at Konami.

134
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,760
I started doing step data, and then I moved into functionality QA testing.

135
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,600
And then I left QA to go pursue other career.

136
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
It happens.

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
It happens.

138
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
You move on.

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Yeah.

140
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,120
And then actually I went back into the video game industry to go to LucasArts, and I was

141
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,520
a QA tester there.

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280
I did compliance testing, so that's like standards, first party standards.

143
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,800
So you know, testing to make sure that if we are developing a game for Microsoft or

144
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Sony that they have the right terminology, or it doesn't fail.

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,440
That's what I've heard from some people in the industry, is that those companies are

146
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,200
very strict on, you know, you have to call this button like the Xbox 360 guide button.

147
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,240
And you can't say, oh, that center silver glowing button, or the silver button on the

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,320
controller, it has to be the guide button.

149
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Exactly.

150
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,600
And you know, Microsoft and especially Sony, they're very stringent that you have to use

151
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,080
like their controller layout, like if you're going to show it on screen or in the manual,

152
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,520
it has to look exactly like it, or else, you know, they'll be very angry at you.

153
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,160
Bad things happen, yeah.

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
That's interesting.

155
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,240
So there's a lot more that goes into putting a game like on the multi-platform than you

156
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
might think at first.

157
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Definitely.

158
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Oh, definitely.

159
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
I've seen games fail submission from, you know, going into production just because of

160
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,440
the fact that, you know, the message that comes up when you unplug your controller wasn't

161
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
correct.

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Wow.

163
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Yeah.

164
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
That's a lot of money, too.

165
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,000
It's like at least a couple thousand each time you submit to Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo.

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wow.

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Interesting.

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, thanks for the insight.

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's pretty awesome.

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No problem.

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,480
And right now, I'm working at Perpetual Entertainment.

173
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,280
They haven't come up with any games yet, but the two games that they do have in development

174
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,000
is Gods and Heroes, Roam Rising, and Star Trek Online.

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh.

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Star Trek.

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Star Trek Online?

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

179
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Star Trek Online.

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Awesome.

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, that's something I might get into.

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm the resident Trekkie.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm a closet Trekkie, a little bit.

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Shh.

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't tell anyone.

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But I like Trek.

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So you're in the closet for some things, but out of the closet for us.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Appreciate that.

191
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm still kidnapping you to go see Warp 11.

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right.

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, cool.

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's very cool.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So this is very neat.

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,440
And of course, our chat room is very excited to see another gamer girl on the show over

198
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,160
at Orangelaunchradio.com.

199
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Click on Chat.

200
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,120
We have some folks in the chat room there.

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,480
Fireboma is reminding us that free advertisement doesn't work on your own station.

202
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,000
So these plugs for Orange Launch Radio don't really do anything here.

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's see.

204
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What else here?

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,200
DMN says that DNL is his hero, because your name in the online world is DNL.

206
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Yes, it is.

207
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,660
So DNL is DMN's hero.

208
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
That's a lot of initials.

209
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,160
We have alphabet soup going on here.

210
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
All right.

211
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,100
Well, let's get into what we do at the top of every show and talk about our gaming week.

212
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,760
So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

213
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
I played stuff, actually.

214
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Really?

215
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
What did you play?

216
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,720
Well, we had a barbecue at my place last night that somebody who was invited didn't show

217
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
up for.

218
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Sorry, other things, you know.

219
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
That's okay.

220
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Busy boy.

221
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I have to tease.

222
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,480
But we broke out the 360 and played.

223
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,520
Okay, we had to see how awful the Sonic demo was.

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,440
Dan's actually pretty damn good at controlling that, but it's still awful.

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,960
And it was funny, our friend Alex was over, and Alex is an ex-Marine.

226
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,400
He takes it very seriously, and he was just, he could have been a drill sergeant.

227
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,040
His voice is like, this is making my head explode!

228
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,920
So that was pretty funny.

229
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,040
And then they put up the fear demo, but it was actually cool, because Alex had been playing

230
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,880
it on PC and was going through the differences between the PC and the Xbox 360 in his opinion.

231
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,600
He said it was actually pretty damn close.

232
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,280
And I have to say that I'm probably going to play fear if I don't get motion sick from

233
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
it.

234
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,680
The demo did not make me that motion sick, because first-person shooters always do that

235
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,120
to me.

236
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,840
I love, though, the very freaky element of, Dan's like, okay, watch this, this is about

237
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
to get all Silent Hill.

238
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Look!

239
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,680
I was like, ooh, blood.

240
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,400
I actually, I did hang out with Jamie this week outside the show, which was fun.

241
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,000
And I got to see the walkthrough of the fear demo as well, and it looked pretty neat.

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,780
I don't usually get into first-person shooters, but I like the whole freaky element that fear

243
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
has going on.

244
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,560
And I kind of miss it on the PC, you know, I just, I don't do a whole lot of gaming on

245
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
the PC.

246
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
I apologize to our PC gamer fans.

247
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,240
There's a couple once in a while that'll make me look, but fear's maybe something I'll look

248
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,200
at on the console, for sure.

249
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,260
Well, apart from that, I actually played my first game, well actually I had Dan play it

250
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,600
for me, because I was sort of, my eyes hurt.

251
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,940
So he played Uno on my gamertag, and my first game was one with a draw four.

252
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,940
So I was like, hey!

253
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,520
And then we saw somebody picking their nose on the webcam.

254
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,480
That's pretty tame compared to a lot of things I've heard that people are seeing on Uno webcams.

255
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,880
Nothing is as fun as Dan shit-talking, though.

256
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
That's just really funny.

257
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
But he doesn't do it in the microphone.

258
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
No.

259
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,140
But it was really funny to just hear him, you know, sit there and shit-talk all these

260
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,600
people, they can't hear them, but it's really funny.

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,320
But I also, I bought PSU yesterday, and got around to playing a little bit today.

262
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,680
Phantasy Star Universe, for those not in the know.

263
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Yeah.

264
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,220
I couldn't, for some reason I couldn't get online, it said that my thing was interrupted

265
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,600
or something by the server.

266
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,880
I was like...

267
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Oh!

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Try backing out and going back in.

269
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I did.

270
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Didn't work.

271
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Really?

272
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
There might have weird server things.

273
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, at any rate, if that doesn't work, I'm just gonna change out the credit card

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,760
I used, because I used my ATM card, but my bank has weird authorization things.

275
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,640
So I'm going to try it again later, but I did play a little bit in story mode, and it's

276
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,040
like uber-automé, cliche the game.

277
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
It's not bad.

278
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
It's pretty.

279
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,560
I'm like, okay, but the voice acting sort of irritates me, and hearing the main song

280
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,760
in English irritates me as well.

281
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,060
I was like, whoever they got to sing just can't.

282
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,600
I have a very bad problem with professional singers who are tone deaf, because that's

283
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,820
what this lady sounded like.

284
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,960
And so that was really it for my gaming week.

285
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,280
I did try to play a little bit of Pirate King, but I had some computer issues, and I think

286
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,840
I'm just not going to play that anymore.

287
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,480
It got kind of boring really fast.

288
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,940
Oh, that's too bad.

289
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,600
It's a cute game, just boring.

290
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,400
Alex in our chatroom offers some advice, says, yeah, Jamie, it's been doing that to everyone.

291
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,680
You'll have to keep trying until it works, in regards to Phantasy Star Universe.

292
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,120
It did that to me once, but then when I went back in, it worked, so I don't know.

293
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,520
Well, I'm thinking that I'm going to try to recreate my ranger chick that kicked ass.

294
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
All right.

295
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Well, good luck to you.

296
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,480
Hopefully I can, but I'm still pissed off, though, about not being able to make a really

297
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
girly man.

298
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,040
We'll have to party up together sometime, but it'll have to wait a couple weeks, because

299
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,720
12's out this week, and that's going to be my life for a couple weeks.

300
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:17,640
I also, though, would like to give a public shout out to the GameStop on Sunrise, because

301
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,320
you guys had some of the best customer service, despite the fact that you know my husband.

302
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
You guys are really, really great, and I have to give a shout out.

303
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,860
Now, one thing we should point out, because obviously most of our listeners don't live

304
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,080
in the Sacramento area, but the GameStop on Sunrise is funny, because right across the

305
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,960
street is a mall with a GameStop in it.

306
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,680
So these two are within walking distance of each other.

307
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
It's kind of crazy.

308
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,040
They were a very busy store, but for as busy as they were, I was noticing that they were

309
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,360
trying to give everybody attention, and that, to me, was just really kind of refreshing

310
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,720
to see at a GameStop.

311
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,120
That's good advice for any employees that we might have that listen to this show, because

312
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,240
I know we do have some employees of certain games, not just GameStop, but GameCrazy, all

313
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
the other ones, too, listen to this.

314
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
My hubby is no longer associated with GameStop, but that still doesn't mean I hate him.

315
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
All right.

316
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,080
Let's go over to Loki.

317
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
How was your gaming week?

318
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I didn't play too much.

319
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,200
I played Saints Row, finished the Vice King storyline, so now I'm a quarter of the way

320
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
through the game.

321
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,440
I started the West Side Rollers storyline, and I don't know.

322
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
It's still fun.

323
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,400
I still play it every lunch, usually causing some sort of mayhem and trying to find new

324
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:32,320
ways to die or explode or just glitches in the game, and yeah, it's really entertaining.

325
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
I played the Tony Hawk's Project 8 demo, and I don't care for it one bit.

326
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,880
It's a great game, I'm sure.

327
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,320
It's just too technical now.

328
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,280
If you aren't really into Tony Hawk and you're picking this up the first time to go into

329
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,320
it, you're going to have trouble doing a lot of stuff.

330
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,560
I felt an awful lot, whereas Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it was fucking easy.

331
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,860
It was fun to be able to pull off crazy stuff, and it wasn't too hard.

332
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,280
Now they're just giving you way too much damn control over stuff, and I think that'd be

333
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,600
good if you know what you're doing, but if you don't know what you're doing, that's not

334
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
really good.

335
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I don't know.

336
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
It's pretty, though.

337
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
What was the other demo I was going to try?

338
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,120
I meant to try Rainbow Six, but we were supposed to be playing in our theater at work, but

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,960
we didn't get a chance to do that, so I didn't play it.

340
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,920
Or Need for Speed Most Wanted, actually, because I'm trying to finish up the game before Carbon

341
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:40,720
comes out, and I'm about halfway through that now, so that's good.

342
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,040
Waiting for Vice City Stories, it's coming out on Tuesday, so we'll be able to switch

343
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,440
out the game pretty soon, so I'll have a full review of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

344
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
next week.

345
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,480
In the meantime, though, we are finishing up Liberty City Stories, and I am still kicking

346
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:05,400
major ass in our killing spree at work, and so far I'm ahead by, I think, 30 kills, which

347
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
is awesome.

348
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
All right.

349
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Anything else?

350
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
No.

351
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
All right.

352
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,880
Then I can talk about my gaming week.

353
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,260
First off, it's been a little while since we've done a show, because we pre-taped last

354
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,680
week on Wednesday, because we did all that traveling.

355
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,400
How was YowieCon, by the way?

356
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Dark Sakura.

357
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
I forgot another game I played.

358
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Oh, what's that?

359
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,720
I downloaded Luminous for mobile, and it's actually pretty fun.

360
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Yeah?

361
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
For a mobile game?

362
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
I've been playing Shinin.

363
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I usually don't, really, Shinin's on the mobile version.

364
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,360
Here, I'll tell you what, I'll play it up in a second, because I can get it to play

365
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
through the mic.

366
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
All right.

367
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Do it after.

368
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
But YowieCon was fun.

369
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,240
I forgot to mention, I played Luminous live, and eh, eh, eh.

370
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
It's not the same as PSP.

371
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,920
I don't think it's worth spending the $15.

372
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I just don't know.

373
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
For half the game?

374
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Yeah.

375
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
For half the PSP version?

376
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Yeah.

377
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
I don't know.

378
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,280
It's okay, I guess, but I have problems with some of the graphics in there.

379
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,080
Some of the tilesets that they have are hard to see, and it really hurts my eyes to try

380
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,280
to concentrate on it.

381
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,480
If they had an option to keep a specific tileset and just change the music or something, that

382
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
would be great.

383
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,840
Well, you can do that in a different mode, but then you don't unlock new skins, because

384
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,880
you can do a skin rotate.

385
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,520
You can set the order of the skins as they show up, but then if you don't play through

386
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,740
the regular mode, you can't unlock skins to use in that mode, so it's kind of a double

387
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
edged sword.

388
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,600
And then there's the achievement in order to use that mode or whatever, you have to

389
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,480
unlock a ton of different skins, but the problem is you have to score 500,000 points, and the

390
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,500
only way you're able to do that with one play through is you have to buy the other packs.

391
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,120
So in order to get certain achievements, you have to buy the other packs.

392
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,680
Thank you very much Cute Entertainment.

393
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,280
My Gaming Week, I played Phantasy Star Universe.

394
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,980
Now I can finally talk about it, because I've played the commercial release, and so I feel

395
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,920
a little better giving a full review of this game.

396
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,480
I like Phantasy Star Universe a lot because it's different from other MMOs because it's

397
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,640
a little more action oriented from what you're used to.

398
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,280
Final Fantasy World of Warcraft have action elements, but in the end I feel that Phantasy

399
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,200
Star Universe is a lot more action oriented than the others.

400
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,080
It kind of feels like a 3D Diablo, that's kind of what Phantasy Star Online was.

401
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,200
Phantasy Star Universe takes a lot of what was started in Phantasy Star Online and just

402
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,680
improves on it, so it's really a good sequel, solid sequel to Phantasy Star Online.

403
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,960
I do love the fact that they put in a single player mode, and it's actually surprisingly

404
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
decent.

405
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,120
I thought it was going to be kind of a write off crappy thing, but the story is not half

406
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
bad.

407
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,880
I love the way how they have it set up like a cheesy anime type thing, but I agree with

408
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,160
Jamie that whoever is singing that opening song is pretty bad, but a lot of animes have

409
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,360
cheesy openings, but literally you play the game in chapters, and every chapter starts

410
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,600
off with the same cheesy anime-ish opening.

411
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,000
It's not actual anime, but they use the in-game engine and do it, but you'll see what I mean.

412
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,920
It's set up just like an anime.

413
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,680
But the funny thing is when you beat a chapter, then it goes like, next time on Phantasy Star

414
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Universe.

415
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,160
It's really funny, so I love the way it's set up, and I don't think the story is that

416
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
bad.

417
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,080
The only thing I don't like is that there's odd loading in cut scenes.

418
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,880
They don't load the cut scene all at once.

419
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,720
They'll load half, and then there's a cut scene, and then they do another.

420
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,400
It's kind of weird, so it's got some weird loading issues, but you kind of get over that.

421
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,520
The other thing I think that doesn't settle well with me in Phantasy Star Universe is

422
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,840
that it seems like the gameplay might seem to get a little repetitive towards the end,

423
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,240
but they've added a lot of different types of weapons and certain types of spells that

424
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
you can use.

425
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,840
I don't know if this game is necessarily going to be for everyone, but if you check

426
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,360
out the beta and you liked it, I'd say give the commercial release a try.

427
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,280
You don't have to put up with the online stuff if you don't want to because the single player

428
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,400
mode is pretty decent.

429
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,880
It's a decent game.

430
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,080
I don't know if it's $60, but there's the PlayStation 2 and PC ones available I think

431
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,200
a little bit cheaper.

432
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,360
But I'm going to play this for a little while, but I don't know if I'd play this more than

433
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
like three months.

434
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,740
I think the magic will be gone in a few months, but we'll see.

435
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,800
It's all up to Sega, and are they going to keep it new and keep it fresh and keep it

436
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
updated?

437
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,640
Right now I worry a little bit because they are having some server problems, but I suppose

438
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
it's early on.

439
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
They just launched a big game.

440
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,800
There's going to be a few issues, but hopefully those will fix themselves because I know they

441
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,160
had a lot of game maintenance problems with Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox, and I'd

442
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,880
really hate to see the same thing happen with the universe.

443
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,160
So fan community, speak up when things are going wrong, and hopefully Sega will be listening.

444
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,760
I do recommend Phantasy Star Universe to fans of role-playing type games, and I would say

445
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,400
the closest thing I could really compare it to that's not online would be something like,

446
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,080
I don't know, it feels a little bit like Zelda to me, a little bit, but maybe with less puzzle

447
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
element.

448
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,120
I will say though that some of the scenery in Phantasy Star Universe is gorgeous.

449
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,320
There's a planet that has a very old Asia type theme to it.

450
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,200
It's really gorgeous, some of the areas there.

451
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,920
So it's really a step up graphically from PSO, which got kind of old with the graphics

452
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,360
after playing it a little while.

453
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,880
Let's see, the other game I want to talk about really quickly is Clubhouse Games for the

454
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,040
DS because I picked it up, but I haven't really talked about it on the show.

455
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
It's pretty cool.

456
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,840
There's a lot, a lot of games on it, and I think that value alone makes it worth a purchase

457
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,440
if you're into the casual games.

458
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,640
If you're not into casual games, you want something with more depth, I don't think there's

459
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,040
going to be a whole lot here for you.

460
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,560
They try to make it a little longer gameplay and kind of streamline it all together with

461
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,520
things like mission mode and stamp mode, but overall it's nothing more than just an excuse

462
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,200
to make you try every single game.

463
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,440
I was a little disappointed that online doesn't have certain games in it, so be careful before

464
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
you pick up the game.

465
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,920
Check out, do some research online and see if the games you want to play online are even

466
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,560
playable because they aren't all playable online, so be careful.

467
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,200
If you want, I have that music queued up so people can hear what it sounds like.

468
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,560
If it'll come through, hopefully.

469
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
It should.

470
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
I'm starting the level over.

471
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,680
Oh, it's like a cheesy mini version of it, I can hear it.

472
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Yeah, it's like a cheesy mini version of it.

473
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,000
I guess for a phone it's not bad.

474
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,640
It'll pick up in a second.

475
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:25,360
Now, see, this makes me kind of go, why isn't this on the Xbox Live one?

476
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,120
This is like the best song in the game, and they got it on the frickin' cell phone, but

477
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,000
they didn't get it on Xbox Live?

478
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's weird.

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, well.

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Anyway, thank you, Jamie.

481
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,440
I think it turned out pretty nicely.

482
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,280
Yeah, for a cell phone game, that's not bad.

483
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
You know I hate cell phone games, usually.

484
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Anyway.

485
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,680
Renee, how was your gaming week?

486
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,880
What kind of games have you been playing?

487
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,840
Besides the HeroQuest, I have been playing Clubhouse games as well.

488
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't really have Wi-Fi set up at my house, and so I've been stealing Wi-Fi from the Metreon

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,800
because I live in San Francisco.

490
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,200
The only game that I've actually been able to play online is Darts, and it's fine.

491
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,680
But I do understand that if there are some games that you do like and you want to check,

492
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,320
you definitely want to check out and see if you can play it online, because I really was

493
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,560
looking forward to playing Split, or Spit, or Speed.

494
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,800
That was the one I wanted to do, too.

495
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,080
And yeah, because I totally kill on that, so I'm awesome.

496
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
We should play it together.

497
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,640
See, we should have totally battled, but we can't, because we can't play it on the internet.

498
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,040
Don't cry.

499
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,520
I've also played LocoRoco.

500
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,760
I really love that game.

501
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,440
I've beat it like two times now, and it's really cute.

502
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:47,160
Basically it's made by SCEI, or Sony Computer Detainment International, which is Sony.

503
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,560
Basically you play as a world, and there's these little LocoRocos that are these little

504
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:02,640
yellow blobs, and you help them roll around and get rid of the mojos that are trying to

505
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,880
invade the world, and that's basically it.

506
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,080
I guess the closest you can compare it to would be Katamari Damacy, but it's not really.

507
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,680
It's kind of hard when you have these very original games to try and compare it to something

508
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
else.

509
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Definitely.

510
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,480
Probably people were going, like, Fantasy Star Universe is like Zelda.

511
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
What the hell is he saying?

512
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I don't know.

513
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Is it a sword-slashing thing?

514
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I don't know.

515
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I don't know.

516
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,560
It's the best thing I can name.

517
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,280
The reason why I actually started playing LocoRoco again, because I basically beat it

518
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,560
about a month ago, was because I had gone to visit the Sony store at the Metreon, or

519
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,040
PlayStation store, and they had this little booth set up, and they had these little inflatable

520
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
LocoRocos.

521
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:52,920
There was two one-foot LocoRoco inflatables, and then this one huge three-foot one.

522
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,440
I walked up to one of the workers there, and I said, oh, are you guys selling these?

523
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,960
He's like, no, actually, sorry.

524
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,520
I made a little pouty face, because that's what I do.

525
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,680
I asked him, well, can I at least look at it?

526
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,640
He went behind the booth, and he took the smaller one, and he handed that to me.

527
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,080
As soon as I had it in my grasp, I held onto it, and I gave it a quick little hug, and

528
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,440
I said, oh, it's so cute, like the girl I am.

529
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Of course, his heart melted, and he's like, oh, do you want it?

530
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm like, of course.

531
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,200
He's like, well, you can have it for free.

532
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Here it is with her today.

533
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,200
It's here with me today, and before he could say, I'm just kidding, I squeed, and I just

534
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
ran out.

535
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm very happy.

536
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,560
He ran away before he could take it back.

537
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,520
That's why I started playing Loco Roco again.

538
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,920
Another game that I've been playing, actually, right now, I just picked up Cooking Mama.

539
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,880
In the Bay Area, I've visited at least five different EB's, and I've asked every single

540
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,040
time, every time I've gone, and this is multiple occasions, I ask, do you guys have Cooking

541
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Mama?

542
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:15,680
As I've come to expect it, their answer is no, and like the little fangirl of Nintendo

543
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,060
DS games I am, I pout and walk away.

544
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,600
But today, when I came to visit Sacramento, I went to the EB games over in Ardenwood,

545
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,280
and they had Cooking Mama, and right now, Mama is telling me to poke my steak.

546
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Wow, okay.

547
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,920
What kind of game is this?

548
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:47,400
This is some sick, twisted little game under the cutesy farce of a Cooking Mama title.

549
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,600
Hey, well, you know, whatever Mama wants, she gets.

550
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,920
Next year, we're going to have Cooking Emerald, where he yells out things while you're trying

551
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
to cook.

552
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Bam!

553
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Yeah.

554
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,800
Mama wants you to come over here and poke my steak.

555
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
This is dirty.

556
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Dirty, dirty.

557
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
I'm sorry.

558
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
I think I need to get that game.

559
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Wow.

560
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,840
Maybe there's some girly thing, I don't get, oh well, forget it, I don't know.

561
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,960
All right, well that's cool, well great, and I'm glad you brought, can I give your Loco

562
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Rocodoll a hug?

563
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Yes, you can, you can.

564
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Yay!

565
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,560
Here I go.

566
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,640
This is great radio, by the way.

567
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
If only you could see Rob now, he has the biggest grin ever.

568
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,600
I know, it's cute, it's very cute.

569
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,300
I would have tried to steal one too, but you know, I would have had to find a worker there

570
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,800
that bats for my team, and I don't know if there are any there, so, well it is San Francisco

571
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
for God's sake.

572
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Yes.

573
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,440
The official Sony store is still there at the Metreon, even though Sony sold it, right?

574
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
It is.

575
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
The Metreon itself.

576
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Exactly.

577
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
I was at the Metreon last week.

578
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,200
That's right, and how was your experience at the Metreon?

579
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,960
I saw Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D, and I had only had three hours of sleep and it

580
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,880
had been going all day, so I actually fell asleep during the parts where they're handing

581
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
out all the presents.

582
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,920
But right at the beginning, it's me, Chris, Megzi, and Mecco, who is our friend from Canada.

583
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,000
We're all trying to grab the snowflakes at the beginning of the movie, and then me and

584
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,800
Megzi are like, ooh, Jack.

585
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,000
But the thing about it is that they've touched up the quality or something on it because

586
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you can actually see the fibers move in the different clothes that are actually, like

587
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,560
in Sally's dress for instance, you can see the different fiber layouts different for

588
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,920
when they've used different doll models, you know, when they've had her up there for the

589
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,880
different positions and everything.

590
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,600
So if you go, and I think it's actually playing through, I think through December, if you

591
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,000
go onto, actually just do a search for it, a website will pop up for Disney, and you

592
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,320
can actually order your tickets through Fandango, which I highly recommend because it's going

593
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,200
to be sold out the whole time.

594
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Especially this season, yeah.

595
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah, if you can see it anywhere, go see it because it's seriously, it is worth the view.

596
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Awesome.

597
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
All right.

598
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,520
And sitting in line was kind of fun, but not really.

599
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,920
Now while you were doing that, I was in New York City and I actually met up with some

600
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
of our listeners.

601
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,480
So some folks came out to see me at Nintendo World, I thought there was going to be like

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,160
two people, but it turned out to be about seven, so it was cool, I was glad to see some

603
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,080
folks show up at Nintendo World to say hi.

604
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,160
So thank you very much to the New York City folks who came out and said hi, and we went

605
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,400
to lunch together in Times Square, it was very cool.

606
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,160
And hold on one minute, I'll be right back because they gave us some stuff from Digital

607
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,740
Life, so I'll be right back.

608
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,520
Next radio ever, where Rob runs out of the room, giddy like a little schoolgirl.

609
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
That's adorable.

610
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:34,440
In the meantime, the ferret will serenade everybody, and oh, Rob's back.

611
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,840
You could have stayed gone, this could have been a ferret show.

612
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,520
So I have shirts, so I don't know who wants what, but the white one seems a little more

613
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,080
girly, so I'm going to give the white one to Jamie.

614
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
I wear black though.

615
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Oh, you want the black one?

616
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
What's the black one say?

617
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,340
The black one says, let's see, it's- If it's white, I won't wear it.

618
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
The quad father.

619
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,340
Okay, I'll take the white one.

620
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,340
Okay.

621
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,000
Then I'll give the black one to Loki, because he's kind of dark too, so he's dark and gothic

622
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and tragic and all that stuff.

623
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hey, I'm the resident goth.

624
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh, this is cool.

625
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,480
And I have- Unplug and connect.

626
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,000
I have some mouse pads as well, so I'm going to give one to Renee as well, so there you

627
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
go.

628
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Thank you.

629
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And then you guys get mouse pads too.

630
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
That's what I wanted.

631
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh.

632
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The listeners.

633
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Verizon wireless mouse pad.

634
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's funny, because I use singular.

635
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But I thought that was very nice.

636
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You do?

637
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I thought that was very nice that our listeners kept us in mind there, so thank you.

638
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Of course, thank you.

639
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,560
And I'm also going to give Renee, because we have a whole stock of these CDs, some CDs

640
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
from a different drum.

641
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,760
Ooh, I love a different drum.

642
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I know, aren't they the best?

643
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
I know.

644
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,240
And we have some CDs here, and we've been giving these away just kind of sporadically.

645
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,680
We have a CD single for Come With Me from DDR Ultramix 3, a rain dancer, and a song that's

646
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,560
going to be in Ultramix 4, Rupesh Cartel, Yours to Command, is a B-side on this CD,

647
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
so enjoy.

648
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Ooh, amazing.

649
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Thank you.

650
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
I will.

651
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
No problemo.

652
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Have fun with that.

653
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,000
Thank you so much for keeping, and to start us off, we are going to reenact the voicemails

654
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,680
of the week this week, and we have a very special message from our webmaster.

655
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Let's take a listen.

656
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

657
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,200
This is Jason, and I have a very special and happy announcement from all of us.

658
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,560
Starting as of right now, you have a toll-free number that any of you are willing to use.

659
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,880
That number, first off, is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

660
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,520
That is 1-877-4263657.

661
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,320
This is unfortunately only going to the United States and Canada, but the rest of you still

662
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,600
have Skype, and will work at any time.

663
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Free for you.

664
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Have fun.

665
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
All right.

666
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Awesome.

667
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
So now we're almost like legitimate radio here.

668
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,840
We have our own 800 number, or 877 number, but same thing.

669
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,780
So we have a new toll-free number for you guys to use, and you can use that in interacting

670
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,800
with our station when we take calls a little later in the program.

671
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,660
That number, once again, 877-GAME-OLR.

672
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,200
That's 877-4263657.

673
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,300
Because of the fact that we have the toll-free number now, we're thinking this might encourage

674
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,280
folks to leave us voicemails, so we are going to open up that segment we did a while back.

675
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,280
We're going to reopen up that segment for the voicemails of the week.

676
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,480
I'll let you know the topic a little later on in the program.

677
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,560
We'll take your calls on the new 800 number a little bit later.

678
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,080
The old 916 number still works for those of you in the area, but I imagine most people

679
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,280
probably aren't going to want to use that.

680
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,980
Tonight marks the last week of our DDR previews.

681
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,820
New songs for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.

682
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,400
Too bad that today's last week, but we've been doing it for eight weeks, and we've got

683
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,100
some new songs for you guys tonight.

684
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,600
Very excited about that.

685
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,080
Orange Lounge Radio has a brand new YouTube channel.

686
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,400
If you listened to last week's episode, I believe I threatened to put something up.

687
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, the Loki drunk thing playing Mario Kart.

688
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,400
I threatened to put that up on YouTube.

689
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
I did, so check that out.

690
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,880
We are on YouTube under username Orange Lounge Radio, and some folks have already found the

691
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
videos and are subscribing to them.

692
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,680
I'm sure that was of excellent quality seeing as, you know, I think it was formatted for

693
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
the PSP.

694
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,880
It actually didn't come out that bad.

695
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,600
It actually came out pretty good.

696
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,040
I put some other stuff up there, too.

697
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,480
We have some news bits, like you remember the Oh, It's So Much Fun clip?

698
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,300
That's up there as well on YouTube, but one of them, there's a Guitar Hero story that

699
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,160
has Dark Soccer and Loki in it, and it came out squished for some reason.

700
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
The video is squished.

701
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,360
It's letterboxed, but not really, so I don't know what to do about that, but it's all there

702
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,120
if you folks want to check it out.

703
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,980
All right, let's get into some news.

704
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,720
Loki's going to start us off tonight, and he's going to cover some things that happened

705
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,560
because we pre-taped on Wednesday, and usually we do our show on Sunday, so he's going to

706
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,360
kind of do a bit of a gap story, so things we didn't get a chance to talk about last

707
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
week that we should have.

708
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,120
And pretty much the only thing that we missed talking about was the PlayStation Day in San

709
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,460
Francisco, and of course lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation 3, and a lot of

710
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,800
things being pulled out of the PlayStation 3, including the fact that they will not have

711
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,000
a gamer score system.

712
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,040
Originally they were going to be putting out that entitlement system that everyone had

713
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,200
a problem with because it kind of ripped off of the Xbox Live achievement system.

714
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,780
Well, that's not going to happen according to Jack Trenton from Sony.

715
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,160
There's no gamer score system at all.

716
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,360
They just kind of ran out of time and didn't feel like putting it in there, so very interesting

717
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
there.

718
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,680
And if you happen to be lucky enough to snag one of the first PlayStation 3s out there,

719
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,480
one of the first 500,000 of course, you may be getting a copy of Talladega Nights on Blu-ray,

720
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,880
because of course they really want to push that Blu-ray format with the Blu-ray drive

721
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,960
being in the actual console, so you get to enjoy that Will Ferrell comedy.

722
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,280
And it was actually pretty good, so definitely worth it, kind of like the Spider-Man 2 on

723
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
the PSP.

724
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,400
Anyways, some other stuff you'll be getting with your system of course, you probably want

725
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:44,080
to be getting some games, and their launch games have really kind of slimmed down a bit.

726
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,280
Sony's first party stuff, they've got Resistance, Fall of Man, NBA 07, and Genji Days of Blade.

727
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,480
Those will all be launch titles.

728
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,840
Now of course, Lair and Warhawk have been pushed to next year, so you won't see those

729
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,200
for a while.

730
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,080
Some other wonderful third party games though, of course the exclusive Full Auto 2 will be

731
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:13,960
coming out from Sega, Until Legends Dark Kingdom, Ridge Racer 7, and of course they will also

732
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:20,920
be getting versions of Fear, Fight Night Round 3, Elder Scrolls, Oblivion, Blazing Angels,

733
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,400
Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk's Project 8, and all the big stuff.

734
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,840
So it's an interesting launch window, I don't know.

735
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,360
Anywho, some stuff not Sony related.

736
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,000
Luminous Live, now there's been of course a lot of controversy over the whole buy half

737
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,720
of a game, purchase the rest of the game later on kind of format.

738
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,520
Well Mitsuguchi himself actually was interviewed by IGN, and one of the questions they asked

739
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:59,680
him was about that system, and of course he supports it, and basically saying Luminous

740
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,000
when it came out on the PSP was more expensive, and he feels that I guess you should pay the

741
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,360
same price on the 360.

742
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,100
Well thank you very much, I'll remember that when you release any other Q Entertainment

743
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,920
games like the wonderful 99 Nights, glad I rushed out to buy that one.

744
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,560
I actually did rush out to buy 99 Nights because I loved the demo and everything, and I got

745
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,040
mine for free, so glad I didn't spend money.

746
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:33,800
I will say though, I will not be buying Luminous Plus or Luminous 2, or any of your Extend

747
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,360
Extra, every Extend Extra, screw you, I'm not buying that crap either.

748
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,760
And I will buy them all because I'm a whore.

749
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,240
Actually I probably won't get the PS2 one, that is a little bit of overkill, but I do

750
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,200
want Luminous 2 and I do want every Extend Extra, so what can I say.

751
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Sorry.

752
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,000
Whatever.

753
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,800
So that pretty much does it for the big stories that we missed in that little bit of a gap,

754
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,480
I want to do some comments from chat real fast because the chat room is just lit up

755
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,640
on some of this stuff.

756
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,200
Jeremy Todd 1 says they ran out of time, it's kind of interesting to know that the 360 came

757
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,440
out a year earlier than PlayStation 3 and yet it has achievements, and so the PlayStation

758
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,520
3 had an extra year to get it, but they couldn't even get this simple feature?

759
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,520
I don't know, lack of achievements, is that going to kill the PS3?

760
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,920
I don't think it's a big deal.

761
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,160
I don't think that's really a big deal, but I think what's really interesting is some

762
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,800
of the launch games not having online support, that is a big deal right there I think.

763
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,440
This just adds one of those little mouth protectors in Kudaragi's helmet.

764
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,720
You're an achievement point, Torloki, does this lower your opinion of Sony or do you

765
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
really care?

766
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Not really.

767
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,600
If anything, Microsoft has this wonderful achievement system to get me to buy games

768
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:51,060
I normally probably wouldn't buy or to rent games, it kind of drives the market a little

769
00:36:51,060 --> 00:37:00,880
bit to get you to play more games, so I guess it would, to be honest, it's not a real deal

770
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,220
breaker for me, but I think the lack of online and certain games for them is a deal breaker

771
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,220
for me.

772
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:12,320
And the other thing is they haven't really still haven't said what their online service

773
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,920
has, and they're saying it's free, but I don't see multiplayer gaming as...

774
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,400
They showed a friends list.

775
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,640
Okay, friends list is free, you get that free with Xbox Live, but they still have not come

776
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,000
out and said multiplayer gaming is free.

777
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,960
They have not said that yet, so I'm thinking it's probably not free.

778
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,920
Shadow Charlie in our chat room says, what about backwards memory card support for PlayStation

779
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
3?

780
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
You've got to buy something for that, though.

781
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Yeah, there's a little adapter.

782
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,280
You can do that with the 360, but you've got to buy something, so mind if I ask you that?

783
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,160
Well, you know what, at least they're putting out the actual device to do it instead of

784
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
some third party.

785
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,320
I mean, props to them for that, but I don't know, they're pretty much coming out with

786
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,000
equivalents for everything.

787
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,960
Fireboma in our chat says, I thought it wasn't a Sony launch until Ridge Racer game was launched

788
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
with it.

789
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,200
That's true, it's got to be a Ridge Racer.

790
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,680
Ridge Racer, I had to, at least one more time.

791
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,080
I think this is interesting.

792
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,400
Kendro lends an interesting perspective here on the Luminous microtransactions debate.

793
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,640
If microtransactions total the price of a normal game, then that's kind of cool, and

794
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,960
as somebody had calculated above, if you buy Luminous and all the microtransactions, it's

795
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,040
going to be about $35.

796
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,400
Well, let me put it this way.

797
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,880
It's either they release it on live and you have the option to buy these microtransactions,

798
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,000
or they just port it and throw it out on a CD or DVD and just put it in there and you

799
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,160
get it all anyways, and it's all the same game, kind of like Luminous Plus.

800
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,080
What I didn't like about the whole thing is I felt they weren't very upfront about telling

801
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,720
us what the game was not going to have.

802
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,900
I was very disappointed to find VS Computer wasn't there, because that's kind of a way

803
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,240
you could unlock skins in the original PSP version, so I kind of went there to try and

804
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,360
unlock more skins, and you kind of couldn't do it.

805
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,400
So that was a little bit disappointing, and I didn't realize that feature was going to

806
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,360
be gone, or well, have one stage only.

807
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,120
I can understand downloading more skins, but I don't like downloading new features.

808
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,320
I shouldn't have to buy two-player.

809
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,440
You know what, Blaze says they could have packaged Luminous as a real game and no one

810
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,980
would be bitching, and you know what, I don't know, it would have been a little less deceptive

811
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
in my mind.

812
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,640
I don't know, there's a certain element of deception with this whole thing.

813
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,480
Maybe I'm being overreactive, I don't know.

814
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,120
Well, also one thing to consider being in the video game industry is the production

815
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,040
costs, you know, they would have to not only go through rigorous testing to ensure that

816
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,360
all of the content in the game follows Microsoft's strict rules, but also how much it would cost

817
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:53,800
to send and make the CDs and the manuals and things like that, otherwise you could just

818
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
buy it online.

819
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,980
True, but don't the online games go through a similar process?

820
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,120
Maybe it's not as rigid, but the way, because remember when we had that story a couple weeks

821
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,920
back about how Duke Nukem wasn't going to be on Xbox Live anytime soon because it would

822
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,200
have to go through a process, and Microsoft supposedly has all these games in a queue

823
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,720
waiting to go on the arcade, so maybe there is still a process, but maybe it's less stringent

824
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,120
than having to put the manual, do the clamshells, all that stuff.

825
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,400
So it would definitely cost less to go straight to Live.

826
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,300
I think the reason why they did it on Live to begin with was so they could, it started

827
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,560
off as a microtransactions thing, it was like, oh we could sell the Madonna skin and we could

828
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,120
sell whatever other artist skins we're going to have, and then it just turned into, hey

829
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,500
let's microtransaction for everything!

830
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,240
But there's some interesting perspectives, I know we got an email on this too, so I'll

831
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,000
save that for the mailbag that lends an interesting perspective as well.

832
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,360
Well I'm sure we've got more stories about it too, I know there's other stuff this week,

833
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,560
but I haven't looked at the show rules, so good job prepping for tonight.

834
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,060
For example, the whole Madden training videos thing where they want you to buy that stuff,

835
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:07,080
I think people are starting to see, oh microtransactions are working, then everyone's jumping on bandwagon,

836
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,880
but no one's getting it right.

837
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,720
It's kind of like one of those things, like back when motion sensing, ooh motion sensing

838
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,980
is cool, let's all release motion sensing stuff now, and not everyone has it, or stuff

839
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,960
for the DS.

840
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,240
Touchscreen is awesome, let's make more games supporting touchscreen, like some games had

841
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,440
the touchscreen with pause, just retarded stuff like that, so some people don't get

842
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
it.

843
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,080
We've got to keep it moving here, we're like 40 minutes into the show and two stories in,

844
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,260
so I want to mention this story, this was another one from last week, but this was so

845
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:50,040
huge that it's still being blogged about this week, and this is a feature in the video game

846
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,720
Bully, that gaygamer.net and another site, I believe it was Game Brink, captured videos

847
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,560
of hot boy-on-boy action, basically, that the main character in the game, Jimmy Hopkins,

848
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,000
can kiss boys as well as girls in the game.

849
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Hey boy.

850
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,200
Actually, I believe there were certain ones.

851
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,240
You have to inspect them first and you'll have an action option for kiss.

852
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,700
There's about 10% of the characters you can do that to.

853
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:24,340
And they have the same animation as the females.

854
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:30,040
It's causing this big controversy, I don't know, I sit back at this and I go, and keep

855
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,520
in mind I'm gay myself, and I'm looking at this going, this is a way bigger deal than

856
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
it ought to be.

857
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,800
I'm just sitting here going, when it was in the Sims, it was like, okay, hey, you can

858
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,080
just do this if you want or do this if you want, but now it seems to be like, I don't

859
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,800
know, with all these sites reporting on it and all this stuff, you guys are making a

860
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,880
big deal out of what shouldn't, it's just, hey, if you want to play the game like this,

861
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,720
if you want to try this, like Fable, yeah, and Fable, you kind of did that too.

862
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,320
I don't know why this is such a, it's dumb, and you know why?

863
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,120
Because people are looking, they are, I swear to God, people are just making Rockstar fucking

864
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,700
scapegoat for everything.

865
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,640
They are scrutinizing these games to find something wrong so they can go and sue them

866
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
some more.

867
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
You know what?

868
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,680
Before you go and start doing that, be warned that they did put this content, they brought

869
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,080
it to the attention of the ERSRB when they were giving it a team rating.

870
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,800
So you know what?

871
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,280
Fuck off, because this is all kosher, you know, people approved this for the team rating,

872
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,760
and that's it, that's the game, play it.

873
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,840
You know, at least, hey, at least he's not fucking bashing skulls in or, you know, eating

874
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,000
brains or something like that, just, it's just fucking kissing, that's all it is.

875
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You know what?

876
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,300
By curious people, there are tons of them in college and stuff, who gives a shit about

877
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:52,720
just, you know, a fictional character who's not even real kissing a fictional character

878
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,760
who's not even real who happens to be disguised as a male person.

879
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,320
I mean, these are, it's like saying, oh, you know, two puppets making out, oh, but they're

880
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,540
male puppets, you know, so that's really wrong.

881
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:12,440
And nobody really cried out about the whole, you know, blowjob scene in Team America that

882
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,680
I noticed, because they were puppets.

883
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,960
Well, I don't know, I mean, I understand, you know, why, you know, especially, you know,

884
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,840
gay gaming sites would be a little bit, you know, yay about this, because they, you don't

885
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,720
get this option in a lot of games.

886
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,480
You don't, you don't really, you know, so it's kind of nice to see sandbox games going

887
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,160
towards that, hey, you know, if we're going to interact a romance element into this and

888
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,840
we truly want to be, you know, open, hey, we're going to, you know, so I applaud that

889
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,700
Rockstar did this, but I can't help but take, you know, so I'm not saying it's a bad thing

890
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,700
at all.

891
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,700
I think it's great.

892
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,700
I think it's awesome.

893
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,640
I think, you know, I'm very glad to see that, you know, that's kind of being put into games,

894
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,240
you know, and the true sandbox idea of do whatever you want, literally.

895
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,600
If they were going to be really, though, accurate about it, though, they should have had some

896
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:07,080
girls just, you know, be, I'm not interested in you, I'm interested in her.

897
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,240
Nobody would have blinked an eye.

898
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,240
That's the other weird thing.

899
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Nobody would have blinked an eye at that.

900
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,760
Because the vast majority, I hate to say the vast majority of gamers out there are, well,

901
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,200
desperate young men who like to see hot lesbian action.

902
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,680
They should just do a game called hot lesbian action.

903
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,040
It would sell.

904
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,880
It's called Dead or Alive Extreme.

905
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,200
Yeah, with independently moving boobs.

906
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,720
Where you sit on the other pair's back and do, sorry.

907
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Never mind.

908
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
What were you going to say?

909
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,920
I was going to say Vice City Stories actually has, one of the main characters is a transsexual.

910
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,640
You don't know who it is, but one of them is, you know, we learn later on, one of them

911
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,040
is a tranny and they have a major role in the game.

912
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,360
So it's like Rockstar's trying to, I don't know, push the boundaries of it.

913
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,840
I don't know, it's just, they're just, you know, writing diverse characters into their

914
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,840
games.

915
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Exactly.

916
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,840
You know?

917
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,840
What's wrong with that?

918
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
It's about time.

919
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,120
You know, these kind of aren't the games that really interest me.

920
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,120
Here's the thing.

921
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,520
I'm not going to go buy Bully just because it has this in it and I know other people

922
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:20,120
who did and I'm kind of like, you know it's a game and this is like five seconds of a

923
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,120
game.

924
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,120
I don't know.

925
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,120
I don't understand why you would go.

926
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,480
I mean, maybe they're trying to support the cause or whatever, which, okay, whatever.

927
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,480
But you know what though?

928
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,520
I'd go see a movie that had Christina Ricci naked or something like that.

929
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,400
Maybe five seconds of the movie, but I'd go see because of that.

930
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
All right.

931
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,400
Point made.

932
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,760
Well, speaking of things that have absolutely nothing to do with sexuality, unless you just

933
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:51,160
happen to swing toward Master Chief that way, there is still plans by Microsoft to do the

934
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,600
Halo movie, however, the film studios decided not to.

935
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,240
So Microsoft has issued a statement.

936
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,200
We were disappointed that Universal wanted to significantly renegotiate the financial

937
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,360
points of the deal, but the Halo franchise is hugely popular and our goal remains the

938
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,520
same, to find a partner that shares our passion and will creatively collaborate with us to

939
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,300
best represent the story.

940
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,760
So it may happen, but not anytime soon.

941
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,560
Yeah, I think this just means delays, development hell.

942
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,560
Yeah, seriously.

943
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
Oh, well.

944
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
You know what?

945
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,000
If it takes that much time to get it right, I would much rather see them delay it and

946
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
get it right.

947
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,720
I mean, Halo is a game, so I think the games are what a lot of us are more excited about

948
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,780
than the movie.

949
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,240
So Hollywood, take your time.

950
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,840
Just don't fuck it up.

951
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,120
Exactly.

952
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,540
Some interesting stuff, those rumored from Game Informer is they're saying that they

953
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:51,880
have an insider that's let them know that Halo 3 is going to be getting a demo early

954
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,340
next year, and that's pretty much all we know right now is speculation.

955
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:04,520
There might be a Halo 3 demo early next year, and that would make sense considering the

956
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:13,280
supposed release date of Halo 3 being March or April of next year, so yeah, but duh.

957
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,040
But one of the interesting rumors I also read about Halo 3 demos, they were saying they

958
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,540
might charge for it.

959
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,540
That was a weird rumor.

960
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,260
I read that too.

961
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,260
I don't know.

962
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:29,560
The only way I could see that being, well I guess they kind of already do that.

963
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:36,160
You can go to Best Buy I think and buy a World of Warcraft 14 day trial for a couple bucks.

964
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,280
So I guess charging for demos isn't absolutely unheard of.

965
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,640
I think it does make a lot of people go eh, but if people will pay it, they're going to

966
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
get away with it.

967
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,920
Especially if it's multiplayer and online demo, there's going to be a lot of people

968
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,140
that are down for that.

969
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,800
They probably do have room to get away with charging for that, so I guess we'll see.

970
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
What do you think?

971
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
Would you pay for a Halo 3 demo?

972
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Eh, probably.

973
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
Depends on how much it is.

974
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
It would be nice.

975
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,960
If it's like five bucks, I'm not paying for that, but you know, and also I'm not really

976
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,200
a good indicator of whether you'd pay for it or not because I would probably buy it

977
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,120
just to report on it for the show, so you know.

978
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,880
With the gamer in you, the regular gamer, nonjournalist in you?

979
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,880
No.

980
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,880
Okay.

981
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
I wouldn't pay for it because, you know what I mean?

982
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
I never played Halo.

983
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,560
What if it, now here's a good idea that might justify that, what if it came with those little

984
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,720
pictures or themes or something, came with it, like to maybe sweeten the deal?

985
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
No.

986
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
No?

987
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,720
No, I wouldn't do that.

988
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,960
Here's what I would do is I would, I subscribe to Xbox Magazine and let me get this straight.

989
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,080
Xbox Magazine, they used to come with demos that you couldn't find on Xbox Live Marketplace

990
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,880
and they used to get them like way early and stuff.

991
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,980
That's not the case anymore.

992
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:52,120
Their demos are almost useless now since you can get everything on Xbox Live Marketplace.

993
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,280
I think there's only one demo that I've seen that has not hit the Marketplace and

994
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,380
that would be Timeshift because that was before when it was being put out by Atari instead

995
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,120
of Nvidia.

996
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:09,000
So, you know, if they put it out, that's what I would say they should do is put it

997
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,500
in the magazine.

998
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,840
Interesting comments from our chat room, Bandit says they should not charge for the demo but

999
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,880
should charge for the opportunity to play multiplayer in the demo.

1000
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,880
Well, you know, because servers cost money to maintain, I guess, although no other multiplayer

1001
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,920
demos have been charged as of yet.

1002
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,680
Let's see, ShadowNextGen makes it very clear, I'm not paying for a demo.

1003
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,440
I ain't doing it.

1004
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,120
Let's see, VidPower says Halo 3 will be microtransactions.

1005
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,000
Spend 400 points to get the sniper rifle.

1006
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,660
Oh, I hope not.

1007
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,660
I hope not.

1008
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,660
I don't think so.

1009
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,480
Because it's going to give people money.

1010
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,480
Maps maybe.

1011
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,840
I would see maps.

1012
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,360
I think the way they did it in Halo 1 was great.

1013
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,820
You know, if you are an addict and you have to have these maps right now, great.

1014
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,240
Pay for them and then in three months they'll be free.

1015
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,240
You know?

1016
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,240
I don't know.

1017
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,040
But I think it would throw off the balance of the game to have some people get the sniper

1018
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,660
rifles but some people don't, you know, and we're arbitrarily picking a weapon here.

1019
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,760
We don't mean that that's actually going to happen but I just hope they use caution in

1020
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,320
the microtransactions.

1021
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,240
Maybe learning a little bit from this luminous backlash that's going on.

1022
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,880
What about EA?

1023
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,640
Jeremy Todd 1 is a very interesting point.

1024
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,200
People who don't have their 360 connected to live will find the OXM's demo very useful.

1025
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,880
Some people that play Halo don't play it on live because it does have a very thorough

1026
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,960
story mode in it.

1027
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,000
So something to think about.

1028
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,800
Alright, anyway, one other story about the 360.

1029
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,220
It's possible that there's going to be a dashboard update this week.

1030
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,440
Now this is speculation but the speculation is coming from something Major Nelson said

1031
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,520
in his latest podcast.

1032
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,320
He was talking to a developer on the show and basically they were talking about the

1033
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,060
wireless communicator that's coming out very soon.

1034
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,040
The wireless communicator is scheduled to come out October 31st.

1035
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,760
Major Nelson said, you know, if you were to go to the store today and buy it, you can't

1036
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,520
use it until the fall upgrade to the dashboard.

1037
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,860
Well then that gets people to think, okay, so he's saying that if, because this came

1038
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,220
out last week, this podcast, if you have this communicator early, it's not going to do you

1039
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,220
any good.

1040
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,720
So no worries trying to go find a leaked one.

1041
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:15,280
But if the actual date for this is the 31st and it's not going to work until the dashboard

1042
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,120
update goes into effect, doesn't that mean that the dashboard update needs to happen

1043
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,240
on the 31st or they're going to have some angry customers?

1044
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,120
They would need to put it up beforehand.

1045
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,660
And I think it's about the time to do that anyways because you're going to want to have

1046
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,880
the dashboard update ready for the 7th when the HD DVD player comes out.

1047
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,280
You're going to want to have, you know, the update ready for when the PlayStation 3 comes

1048
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,000
out, so you have that 1080p and you can compete with them.

1049
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,640
And whatever other fun stuff they want to throw in there, more backwards compatibility

1050
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,640
maybe.

1051
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,820
You know, hey, maybe it'd be nice if they had some Ultimate Mortal Combat, or Mortal

1052
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,160
Combat Annihilation, you know, backwards compatibility on there, I'd like to play with that, but

1053
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,160
you know.

1054
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,840
We'll see what happens.

1055
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,520
If anything, if it's not this week, it's very soon.

1056
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,080
Do you think that they've been quiet about the dashboard update because they don't want

1057
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,120
people going, when's it coming out, Major Nelson, when's it coming out, Major Nelson,

1058
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
when's it coming out?

1059
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,280
Well, I'm sure he's trying to be quiet about anything, yeah, just because his fanbase is

1060
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,280
a little...

1061
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,280
...needy.

1062
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,280
...bitchy.

1063
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,280
...needy.

1064
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,280
Are you there?

1065
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,280
Are you there?

1066
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Are you there?

1067
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,280
Are you there?

1068
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Yeah.

1069
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
Major Nelson seems like a really great guy.

1070
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
I've never met him in person.

1071
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
He seems really cool.

1072
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,720
I will turn this dashboard update around if you do not behave.

1073
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,080
But if you read those comments on his board, and you know it's getting to him because,

1074
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,400
you know, he's sad to make some changes, yeah, I'd be so annoyed too.

1075
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,720
All right, anyway.

1076
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,840
Well, something that may annoy other people in regards to Microsoft is that there's actually

1077
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:51,120
indications that they favor the live gold account above the platinum ones.

1078
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,120
Well, they should...

1079
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,120
Over the silver?

1080
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
I'm sorry, over the silver.

1081
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
They should.

1082
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,120
I'm paying for it.

1083
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:04,520
Well, basically they're saying that, especially for some of the demos that are coming out,

1084
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,760
they're releasing them to the gold accounts before they're releasing them to the silver.

1085
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,480
So you'll get the newer trailers, the newer demos, instead of, you know, having to wait

1086
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,200
for them because they're releasing them about a week or so afterwards.

1087
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
That's fine.

1088
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:27,400
That's perfect because it's more incentive to go play on gold, and you know what, hey,

1089
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
it's free.

1090
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,600
You can't complain if you're getting demos later on.

1091
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Just whatever.

1092
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Pay for it.

1093
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,080
So if you're paying 50 bucks for your year subscription, you should be getting your stuff.

1094
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,080
Exactly.

1095
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,040
You should have some sort of perks, and I'm surprised there hasn't really been much more

1096
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
other than this.

1097
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
I mean, so...

1098
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,800
If not, then if you've got the silver, if you want them at the same time, they should

1099
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:55,000
do some sort of pay-by-download for those, if you want to get them ahead of time, but

1100
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
other than that...

1101
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,920
50 dollars a year is really not that expensive.

1102
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,080
And they do giveaways and specials all the time.

1103
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,560
It's expensive next to free, which is what PlayStation 3 is promising, although I know

1104
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,640
they haven't said anything about, I just, you know, I just have a feeling it's going

1105
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,640
to be free.

1106
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,240
I think they've kind of insinuated it, you know what I mean?

1107
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,400
But I don't think they're going to come out of nowhere and say, surprise, you're going

1108
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
to have to pay for this.

1109
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,560
I'm going to piss more people off with that.

1110
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,840
I think Sony is in a corner now where they have to make it free.

1111
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:25,640
Didn't they have that comparison chart that got them in a lot of trouble, that was comparing

1112
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:31,020
the Sony PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360, and it was talking about like, hey, this comes

1113
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,320
with it, and on Xbox, it was basically trying to show the Xbox 360 actually costs more than

1114
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,880
the PlayStation 3, like it was that comparison, and one of the things was they talked about

1115
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,240
Play Online, and it was free on PlayStation 3, so I'm pretty sure it's going to be...

1116
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,720
Well, 50 a month, though, it's not that expensive.

1117
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:53,760
You're technically paying about, I think, $4.17 a month, if you consider, which is less

1118
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:02,400
than the cost of lunch, so if you think about it in the big picture, you really are not

1119
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,200
paying all that much for your subscription cost for Live.

1120
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,440
Couple quick comments in chat.

1121
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,800
Blaze says, good, if I'm paying $50 a year, I should get it earlier.

1122
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,960
JeremyTau1 says, I'd rather pay $50 a year for Live, which has a lot more neat features

1123
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,600
than have the free PS3 Online service, and it having not as many features, so interesting

1124
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
point there as well.

1125
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,600
Pay for what you get.

1126
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,600
All right.

1127
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,320
ShadowNextGen agrees, $50 a year for Xbox Live is a great value.

1128
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,000
All right.

1129
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Interesting.

1130
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I don't know.

1131
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,080
I mean, I'm glad that they have some perks for the gold people.

1132
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:41,280
Anywho, some other fun stuff that's come out about Halo 3 this week, mainly leaked from

1133
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,360
a Swedish magazine called Level, they've had some actual screenshots and stuff, and of

1134
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,400
course, brand new info about the game, including some new weapons like Spiker, which is a new

1135
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,720
brute weapon, a Spartan laser that apparently tears vehicles apart, and a nail grenade,

1136
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,440
which sticks in the walls and sends nails everywhere.

1137
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,400
Brand new vehicles like the Mongoose, which is like a miniature ATV for two passengers

1138
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,680
with no weapons on it, and then the one that people are hoping is mistranslated, but the

1139
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:17,320
Man Cannon, which launches players into the air, kind of like jump pads in Unreal or Quake

1140
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,080
Arena.

1141
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,080
Come step in, sir.

1142
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,000
You want to see my Man Cannon?

1143
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,520
Some interesting stuff.

1144
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,560
They're going to be having the left and right trigger weapons.

1145
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:34,320
You'll be able to reload them separately using the left and right shoulder buttons, and apparently

1146
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,440
the X button has some sort of secret functionality to it that they haven't mentioned yet.

1147
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,440
Man Cannon.

1148
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,400
It's not the Man Cannon.

1149
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,440
Some other interesting stuff is it's going to be coming out in three different SKUs.

1150
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,240
The first one is game only, the second one will be a collector's edition, and the third

1151
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:59,100
one is the legendary edition, which includes a replica of Master Chief's helmet, which

1152
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:05,040
is miniaturized, it's about cat size, so you can put it on your cat, or your Man Cannon.

1153
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,480
It's also going to include documentaries, developer commentary, spinoff material like

1154
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:15,400
Red vs. Blue, Spark of Life, etc., and all the cut scenes from Halo 1.53 and HD on a

1155
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
separate disc.

1156
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,400
That's kind of cool.

1157
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,480
And maybe a sneak peek at the Halo movie, they're just speculating right now.

1158
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,680
But lots of screenshots, looks very pretty, very, very pretty.

1159
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,480
Of course, also coming out at the same time, not to be outdone by this leaked information,

1160
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,920
one up had to mention that EGM will be also having some content on Halo 3, which by the

1161
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:46,180
looks of their content, almost identical to what is in that Swedish magazine, and yeah,

1162
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,880
so they'll be coming, in fact they're going to be doing three weeks of coverage for Halo

1163
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,880
3.

1164
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,640
I thought usually you did that leading up to a game's release.

1165
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,280
This is just randomly, hey folks, three weeks of Halo 3 stuff.

1166
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,060
Okay, well, okay, that's what you want to do.

1167
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:10,960
That whole Man Cannon thing reminds me of when we were playing F.E.A.R. last night,

1168
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:20,400
and there's a weapon in there called the Penetrator, so if that gives you any indication, so anyway.

1169
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,360
Let's see, PooEater says, okay, so I'm guessing Man Cannon will be the next joke we run into

1170
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,480
the ground, most likely, most likely.

1171
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,120
DJ Morpheus asks, hello, by the way, to our good buddy DJ Morpheus, honestly, who really

1172
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,800
looks at the developer extras?

1173
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,880
That's kind of a good question.

1174
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,440
It depends on the game.

1175
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:43,400
I wouldn't buy this Halo 3 Uber edition or whatever, that's too much crap, but I know

1176
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,360
people who love their Halo.

1177
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,040
I might do that just to put a Halo helmet in my cube.

1178
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,400
I don't really have a lot of game memorabilia, and that might be kind of fun.

1179
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,120
I have to see what it looks like, if it looks retarded, I'm not buying it.

1180
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,480
Well, no, I actually love seeing all of the behind the scenes stuff, being in a design

1181
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,520
major myself, I love seeing all the artistic elements that go behind it, but when we got

1182
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,640
the Toy Story box set, I was watching all the rendering errors first, before I was even

1183
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,960
watching the movies, because I'm just into all that kind of stuff.

1184
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,960
I think it's great.

1185
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,880
I like the ones in Shrek, though, where the donkey turns into a big fuzzy porcupine looking

1186
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,880
thing.

1187
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,320
Well, I personally wouldn't mind buying the extra stuff.

1188
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,680
For Company of Heroes, which is an RTS game for the PC, they had just the regular edition

1189
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,680
and they had the special silver edition, and with the special silver edition, they had

1190
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:40,720
a DVD with special features of how they made the storyline, the people they interviewed,

1191
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,800
and it even came with little flashcards, so that you can see what type of tanks you were

1192
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:52,000
fighting and what were some of their names and some of the weak spots and everything,

1193
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,160
so it was pretty interesting for those people who love World War II.

1194
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,400
I'm getting the collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII, so I can watch all the extras

1195
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:09,640
that are going to be there, and yes, I probably will watch them, because I'm sad.

1196
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,160
This is another game I believe has a collector's edition, yes, Gears of War has a collector's

1197
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,160
edition coming out.

1198
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,920
Well, Gears of War has gone gold-ish.

1199
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,200
It has gone officially gold, too, it's gold.

1200
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:26,360
Cliffy B says, my job as designer of Gears of War is well more or less done, and that

1201
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,800
was coming from his official blog, so it does look like Gears of War is going to make it

1202
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
out there on time.

1203
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:36,520
Then it was actually, I think, later on that week also, it was also officially gold.

1204
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,880
I believe Major Nelson kind of dropped that bomb a little later, I think, from what I'm

1205
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
reading.

1206
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Yeah, they're all ready to go.

1207
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,880
So, the game will be out on time, doesn't look like any delays are going to happen unless

1208
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,980
something really screws up, but that's exciting, because for the Halo 3, folks, this is a real

1209
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,460
hold-em-over game.

1210
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,560
Even for non-Halo people, maybe this is something.

1211
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,560
It's really cool-looking.

1212
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:02,180
Yeah, I hope there's a demo on Marketplace, so I can check it out, because it looked really

1213
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,380
cool at E3, but watching and playing are two very, very different things.

1214
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,920
I'm buying it.

1215
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,440
Maybe I'll borrow yours, then, and check it out first.

1216
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,480
I do think I want it, though, after Final Fantasy XII is beaten.

1217
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,440
I'm not getting Final Fantasy XII, though.

1218
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,520
Look, I'm going to say this.

1219
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,040
I've been a very, very good boy.

1220
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:25,680
There is a pirated copy of Final Fantasy XII sitting on the floor of my living room right

1221
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,200
now, and I haven't touched it.

1222
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,880
I'm being good, and I'm being a very good boy.

1223
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,720
Well it's kind of on someone else's PlayStation's hard drive, so I can't really give that away.

1224
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:42,800
I'm not going to name names, but he's sitting in this room, and it's not me.

1225
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,240
I'm not touching it.

1226
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,200
I'm going to wait and buy a legitimate copy of the game when it comes out, because I want

1227
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,200
to do the sappy, like, oh, I'm going to play it on launch day like everyone, and I got

1228
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,360
the call today that says they're just going to do the midnight launch party at GameStop,

1229
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,760
so I'm tempted to take a camera.

1230
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,280
Does somebody want to go with me late tomorrow?

1231
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,220
I'll go with you if you want to get me a copy.

1232
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,220
Take a video camera?

1233
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,220
Tomorrow.

1234
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,840
I'm not going to buy you that game after you bashed on it on this program, so you hate

1235
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
the battle system.

1236
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,840
You can kiss my butt.

1237
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,440
Actually, actually, actually, actually, there are things about that game that make me want

1238
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,120
it, but I'm still so busy.

1239
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:21,440
I really am getting into PSU now, but you let me make a game on my memory card, so I

1240
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,440
play over here.

1241
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,240
GameStops have had Final Fantasy XII since, like, Friday, by the way.

1242
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,680
Yeah, so did CompUSA, but they put them all out on the shelves, from what I hear, but

1243
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,080
I'm being good, and I'm waiting.

1244
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,400
Did somebody want to come, like, we could take a video camera, do something for YouTube.

1245
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,400
I'll go with you.

1246
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,400
I don't know.

1247
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,400
I've got to work on Tuesday.

1248
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,400
Yeah, we'll see.

1249
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,560
I do, too, but hey, staying up late might be fun.

1250
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:46,200
Well, speaking of things, though, that are kind of messed up, you know, they broke a

1251
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,040
particular Walmart in Arkansas, broke street date for Guitar Hero 2.

1252
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:55,800
It was actually reported on, so since it's actually supposed to be released on November

1253
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:02,080
7th, and Walmart said, uh-uh, we're releasing it now, then maybe your local Walmart will

1254
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,080
have it.

1255
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,240
I'm actually sort of thinking about making a run by Walmart, just because I have to play

1256
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,240
Trogdor.

1257
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:14,160
If you know, this is kind of a, well, it's a related story.

1258
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:22,600
You know you can actually hack the demo to play the songs that were unlocked in the game.

1259
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Apparently they were on the demo disc.

1260
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,080
Way to go, programmers!

1261
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,080
You rock!

1262
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,840
Keeping that content on discs.

1263
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,680
This is how hot coffee happens.

1264
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,920
Anyways, so yeah, apparently you can hack the demo.

1265
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,920
They have some programming.

1266
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,920
I've got the demo at my house.

1267
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
Yeah.

1268
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,920
I have to see what's what.

1269
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,360
They have Trogdor on there.

1270
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,600
I don't get it, because I will just keep going back to playing YYZ over and over and over

1271
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,600
again.

1272
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,720
I was even watching this live performance of Rush doing that on YouTube, with the longest

1273
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,480
drum solo ever.

1274
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,400
I am actually passing on Guitar Hero 2 until the 360 version.

1275
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,440
I sold my Guitar Hero today.

1276
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,440
Wow.

1277
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,760
I'm going to probably get both.

1278
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:11,700
As much as I really enjoy Red Octane and so forth, I actually really like Guitar Freaks,

1279
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,440
and that's where my allegiance goes to.

1280
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,640
It goes to Konami, I'm sorry.

1281
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,640
Oh, interesting.

1282
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,520
Actually, I would say you're a little bit in the minority there.

1283
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,760
A lot of people don't really prefer Guitar Freaks.

1284
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,320
I think it just depends on your taste in music, too.

1285
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:30,120
Would you say you like to listen to that Japanese rock and the stuff that's usually in those

1286
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,120
games?

1287
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,120
Oh, definitely.

1288
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,560
That's probably why you prefer Guitar Freaks in the end.

1289
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,560
It really is about the music.

1290
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,560
Yeah.

1291
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,780
I would not have been as excited about Guitar Hero 2 if it wasn't that they put bass mode

1292
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,080
in it, which I always do on Guitar Freaks.

1293
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,080
Same here.

1294
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,320
The good thing, though, that I actually will still prefer Guitar Freaks over Guitar Hero

1295
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,480
4 is because I've got Dramania and I've got a controller, so it's all about putting it

1296
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,640
in session mode and just going at it when you've got a group of people.

1297
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,240
Too bad Keyboard Mania wouldn't link, but that's still...

1298
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,600
It's not that I dislike Guitar Hero.

1299
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,680
I really do want to play Guitar Hero 2, but now it's just such a bad time.

1300
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,000
I really hate Christmas.

1301
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,080
I love it and I hate it, because they just avalanche the games on us at this period.

1302
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,680
And to some people, it's Yule.

1303
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,680
Well, whatever.

1304
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,680
You know what I mean.

1305
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,800
Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate.

1306
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,520
It's just this avalanche of games right now and I can't play them all, so I might as well

1307
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,480
just wait for the 360 version, which will have better graphics, widescreen, and maybe

1308
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,160
some extra songs.

1309
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,160
Who knows?

1310
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,160
We'll wait and see.

1311
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,160
And I'll play it then.

1312
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,680
You can come play at my house.

1313
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,200
Just like I played pinball this week, I forgot to say it in my gaming week, I finally got

1314
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,200
to play one at the table.

1315
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,200
I played Guns N' Roses.

1316
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,200
That's right.

1317
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
My, my, my, my, my, Michelle.

1318
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
All right.

1319
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,600
It was when he goes, I hate you, Michelle!

1320
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,600
That was funny, bro.

1321
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,600
I don't hate Christmas.

1322
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,080
I don't hate chatter saying I hate Christmas.

1323
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,600
I don't hate Christmas.

1324
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,640
I hate you for saying I hate Christmas.

1325
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:56,200
Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, the full track list has been out for a little bit now, including

1326
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:04,680
such wonderful tracks as we mentioned, Strong Bad, Trogdor, The Burninator, from, you know,

1327
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,920
the Homestar Runner, yes, Homestar Runner Flash animation.

1328
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,960
And if you happen to be a fan of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, you might recognize this band

1329
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:24,000
Death Lock as they perform their hit Thunder Horse, and of course Death Lock is from Meneloc,

1330
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,280
Meneloc plus the wonderful, very violent show on Adult Swim.

1331
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,400
I think they had that on the E3 demo, didn't they?

1332
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,400
I don't think so.

1333
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,760
I thought, I remembered hearing it.

1334
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,520
Anyways, some other stuff that they've got coming out, I believe a new Freeze Pops, or

1335
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:47,280
another Freeze Pops song on there, Less Talk, More Rock, yay, Freeze Pop, and some other

1336
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:55,280
stuff and just a bunch of bands I've never heard of, Honest Bob and the Factory to Deals

1337
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
incentive.

1338
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,120
Well, these are all, you know, the indie bands that they put in there too, which is kind

1339
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,120
of cool.

1340
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,920
So yeah, it's pretty cool, and lots of tracks, so definitely worth picking up if you have

1341
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
a guitar.

1342
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
I don't, so I won't.

1343
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,920
Well, you can buy the bundle.

1344
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,920
Why would I do that?

1345
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,920
I just sold back the guitar.

1346
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,640
I'm waiting for the 360.

1347
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,640
Which is a big mistake.

1348
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,120
Why did you announce the 360 one before this?

1349
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,940
Because we'd be so pissed if they announced it after.

1350
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:24,440
You would be pissed, and I would be pissed, and we'd be on this show yelling and bitching.

1351
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,440
But we'd buy it anyways.

1352
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,440
Probably.

1353
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:35,220
All right, let's talk about now Guitar Hero 2 is coming out in a couple weeks, but coming

1354
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:39,600
out this week, if you are in Japan, let's talk about some release dates.

1355
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,960
Xbox 360 is having a ton of stuff go to their Platinum Collection in Japan this week, including

1356
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:49,880
99 Nights, Project Gotham Racing 3, Rumble Roses XX, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and

1357
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,680
Every Party.

1358
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,320
Also another Xbox 360 system is coming out.

1359
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,920
It's kind of their, you know, they talked about this earlier, they're going to release

1360
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,260
kind of a reduced bundle in Japan.

1361
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,080
So that is out this week, Xbox Live Vision making its debut as well.

1362
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,040
For those of you holding out on the PlayStation 2, lots of fans still about the PS2.

1363
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,100
In Japan, you can get Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.

1364
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:19,600
Also coming out, Slaughter Upcore 9 and Gallop Racer in Breed.

1365
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,040
I don't leave it to you to figure out what that is, but I want to point out, this one

1366
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,040
gave us this bot.

1367
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,880
Horses with extra holds on their heads.

1368
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,160
That's how they translate it, folks.

1369
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,520
There it is, I'm looking here at this game, the Slaughter Upcore 9, it looks like it has

1370
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,000
a Go-Go Dancer on the front there.

1371
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,560
It's a gambling simulator, so it has a little Go-Go Girl on the front there.

1372
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,480
Let's see, let me look at the box art here for this Gallop Racer.

1373
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:47,840
Yeah, it looks like a, it says it right there on the box, look at this, here it is, right

1374
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,840
there in the studio.

1375
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,400
Gallop Racer in Breed, right there, 10th anniversary.

1376
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,000
I'm sorry, but is that like, is that kind of like...

1377
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,560
If you're an inbred horse, you probably are going to gallop everywhere.

1378
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,560
Mississippi horse!

1379
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:04,480
And I can say that because I'm from the south, so it's a Mississippi horse.

1380
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,380
Now hold on though, because this doesn't beat what's coming out on the DS, okay?

1381
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:13,280
Coming out on the DS in Japan, there's a new Kirby game, Hoshi no Kirby Sanjyou, and Lego

1382
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:19,880
Star Wars 2 on the Nintendo DS, but here it is, the title of the week for Japanese imports,

1383
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:25,520
Love Hamster on the Nintendo DS.

1384
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,200
It's a strategy game by Digital Kids, and just look at the box art, look at the box

1385
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,440
art, how could you not love that hamster?

1386
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,120
I want the Love Hamster!

1387
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,720
I'm going to import Love Hamster.

1388
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:44,060
I have dwarf hamsters myself, and if it's anything like real hamsters, then they probably

1389
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:48,720
should rename it to Hamster Inbreeding.

1390
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,300
Because they multiply it like crazy.

1391
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:54,240
Now just keep in mind, please keep your love hamsters away from your man cannons, okay?

1392
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:58,840
Boys and girls, I'd appreciate that.

1393
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,480
My brain is now swimming from love hamsters.

1394
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:08,520
Well, anyway, as for our UK friends, we've got a number of things coming out.

1395
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,040
On the first, we have Sam & Max Season 1 Culture Shock for PC.

1396
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,000
On the third, a number of titles, we have Curious George for PlayStation 2, Desperate

1397
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,100
Housewives for PC, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories on PSP, on just about everything Need

1398
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:27,960
for Speed Carbon, Neverwinter Nights 2 on PC, Rule of Rose on PlayStation 2, Scooby

1399
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,400
Doo Who's Watching Who on a number of things, and SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the

1400
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:40,400
Krusty Krab, yeah, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on PC.

1401
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:50,880
A few things, though, that should be made a mention of, I'll go ahead and list some

1402
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,480
of them for the sixth because there's actually the biggest one coming out will be Phantasy

1403
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,000
Star Universe coming out on the sixth of November.

1404
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,320
Other things to look forward to within the month, actually, after having played the demo,

1405
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,120
is WWE SmackDown vs. Raw.

1406
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,120
It's actually really good.

1407
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,960
And if you want to beat everybody, use Kane.

1408
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:18,040
Okay, anyways, I don't speak wrestling, sorry.

1409
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:24,560
Yeah, well, each week we like to talk about some stuff that you may not have heard yet,

1410
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,280
and this week, of course, I'm going to start things off with a few date changes and a few

1411
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,920
price reductions like normal.

1412
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,360
First off, the Xbox 360 games have dropped in price this week.

1413
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,120
Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 dropped down to $49.99, which is good.

1414
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,680
Battlefield 2 also dropped down to $49.99.

1415
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:47,000
NCAA Football 07, which hasn't been out that long, dropped down to $49.99.

1416
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,960
Burnout Revenge, which was already cheap to begin with, $29.99.

1417
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:55,120
I think all Xbox 360 games should drop to $49.99, a more reasonable price, don't you?

1418
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:00,920
Well, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, pretty awesome game, dropped down to $39.99, so that's

1419
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,920
pretty cool.

1420
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:08,480
And, of course, if you don't have a 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox Madden dropped down to $39.99,

1421
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:13,560
and the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on PlayStation 2 and Xbox dropped down to $19.99,

1422
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,560
so not bad.

1423
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,940
Now some date changes.

1424
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,360
It's very interesting.

1425
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,040
A few things you might not have heard yet, including some of the Wii launch titles have

1426
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,040
been delayed.

1427
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,120
It's quite interesting.

1428
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:32,080
For example, Blazing Angels on the Wii has been delayed to December 6th.

1429
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:38,240
Far Cry Instinct's Predator has been delayed to next year, January 16th, which is very

1430
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,400
interesting.

1431
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:44,080
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Wii has been delayed to December 7th.

1432
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,080
Call of Duty 3 has also been delayed to December 7th.

1433
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,360
And Marvel Ultimate Alliance, December 7th.

1434
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:55,720
So Activision, something happened there because all their titles got delayed.

1435
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:01,160
If you're looking for Elder Scrolls Oblivion on the PS3, I mentioned it was a launch title,

1436
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:05,040
but of course that's the launch window, not launch day.

1437
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,840
December 12th, it's already starting its move into March, kind of like the 360 version

1438
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,080
was.

1439
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,560
It's slowly sneaking away.

1440
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,560
Some other games you might also be looking forward to, especially not on the PS3, but

1441
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,200
on the 360, Fusion Frenzy 2 won't be coming out this year.

1442
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:29,500
It's coming out January 16th of next year.

1443
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:35,080
Some games also announced Warriors on the PSP is coming out December 13th.

1444
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:40,560
Silent Hill Origins has also been delayed to next year, so you won't be seeing that

1445
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,840
until at least January 17th.

1446
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,240
I want to say I read somewhere there's some major reworking going on there, which is why

1447
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,240
it was delayed.

1448
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,280
That date has been bouncing around this week like crazy.

1449
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,520
It was in March at one time this week.

1450
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,600
It's nuts.

1451
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,600
One point though about that is that if you go in the Akira Yamaoka community on Live

1452
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:04,280
Journal, there's actually previews to some of the tracks in the game.

1453
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,400
And then finally, two other titles were announced from Buena Vista Interactive that you haven't

1454
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,960
heard about yet on systems.

1455
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,880
Pirates of the Caribbean 3, of course that's a working title, is going to be coming out

1456
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:23,080
on PlayStation 3, the Wii, Xbox 360, DS, and PSP May 16th of next year.

1457
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,480
And God, why are they making this game?

1458
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,640
High School Musical The Game is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and

1459
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,680
the DS on July 11th.

1460
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,760
Those are your dates for the week for exclusive stuff.

1461
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,480
Real quickly, footy monsters dyin' in chat here wants to know, you know the release date

1462
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,560
for Splinter Cell Double Agent on PS2?

1463
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,240
Splinter Cell Double Agent?

1464
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,240
For the US?

1465
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,240
Yeah.

1466
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,240
That was actually last week?

1467
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,240
For PS2?

1468
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,220
Yeah, it came out a week after, after the 360.

1469
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:59,840
So that was last week.

1470
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,960
Some other stuff, of course, releases for this week.

1471
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,560
We've got lots of big stuff.

1472
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:12,960
This is kind of getting into the whole, you know, kind of end of the year push.

1473
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,520
Need for Speed Carbon on pretty much every single system out there except for the PlayStation

1474
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,640
3 and Wii, because those are coming out a little bit later.

1475
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:27,080
Of course you've got Children of Mana on the DS, Pokemon Ranger on the DS.

1476
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,280
Of course Final Fantasy XII, because that's awesome.

1477
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:37,640
On the 360 you've got F.E.A.R., which is going to be pretty sweet.

1478
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,960
I think that was the only 360, oh FIFA Soccer 07, because it's been delayed.

1479
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,640
On Xbox, a lot more Racing Mania 2007, awesome.

1480
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:52,200
And of course my favorites on the PSP, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

1481
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,880
And if you're not in the Vice City Stories, Death Junior Root of Evil, Killzone Liberation,

1482
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:03,240
Blind Quiz, which is by the guy that did Brain Age, and Power Stone Collection, which is

1483
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,600
pretty cool.

1484
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,920
So that's a little slice of the stuff coming out, not everything of course.

1485
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,360
As far as things coming out much later, it was actually listed in the official Xbox 360

1486
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:21,440
magazine that Bethesda is working on a game that uses the Unreal Engine 3 called Rogue

1487
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,440
Warrior.

1488
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:26,920
It's also going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 3.

1489
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,560
It's a multiplayer anti-terrorism game.

1490
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:35,040
It's actually based on books by Richard Marcinko, I think that's how it's pronounced, and being

1491
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,680
developed by Zombie Studios.

1492
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,480
They worked on Shadow Ops prior.

1493
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:45,440
It has some different modes, including one that generates a map based on what the teams

1494
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,640
decide on beforehand, like a cooperative map.

1495
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:54,280
And you're the only one who will know the territory you start off in.

1496
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:59,320
Also has a four player co-op mode, 24 and other multiplayer modes.

1497
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:06,720
Sounds pretty cool, actually, if you like those types of games.

1498
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,320
I like Bethesda.

1499
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,400
Yeah, I like Bethesda too.

1500
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,320
We have a series of oopsie things to report.

1501
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,800
There's been a lot of oopsies.

1502
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,760
Remember last week, the big, big oopsie with Bubble Bobble on the DS?

1503
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,400
Nothing quite that major, but a couple big oopsies nonetheless.

1504
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:31,160
Somebody noticed just now that, I believe this was on NeoGAF, those big forums over

1505
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:38,140
there, noticed that the GameCube Killer7 box, if you look at the back, it points you to

1506
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:43,520
a website, www.killer7.com.

1507
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,880
Killer7.com is a porno site.

1508
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,640
The correct site should have been killer-7.com.

1509
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,160
Are you going to killer7.com right now, Loki?

1510
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,160
No, I'm not.

1511
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,520
Someone is sending me a private message.

1512
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,360
I saw him reach for the keyboard as I said that.

1513
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,800
I thought he was going to check that out right now.

1514
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:07,240
Certainly a lot of free publicity for that porno site this week, thanks to Capcom's proofreading

1515
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,240
team.

1516
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,400
Good job, Capcom.

1517
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:15,960
Some other funny oopsies have been going on, like in Glasgow, because apparently Wii's

1518
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,760
out over there, according to some of their clocks, which have been incorrectly set up.

1519
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,600
It's their countdown clocks that they have for the Wii, so now it's just saying out now,

1520
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,920
but I don't know, big deal.

1521
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,760
So someone messed up a clock.

1522
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:37,040
Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing to put on the internet, like, hey, somebody can't set

1523
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,080
a clock, that's gaming news.

1524
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,240
But I guess some folks are curious what it's going to look like when all is said and done.

1525
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,960
Couple website oopsies going on right now.

1526
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:55,540
Walmart was listing the PlayStation 3 for $299.82.

1527
01:19:55,540 --> 01:20:01,240
Keep in mind the PlayStation 3 is supposed to cost at least $4.99 for the low one, $5.99

1528
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,240
for the high one.

1529
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,320
Well, you know they do sell a lot of stuff as lost leaders.

1530
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,280
Yeah, but I don't think it's supposed to be that low.

1531
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,400
I think someone made a boo-boo.

1532
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,400
Someone copied the...

1533
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,400
Pulling back prices.

1534
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,960
That sounds like the Xbox 360 price right there, $299.82.

1535
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,520
Also a late-breaking oopsie we got posted to our forums just before the show, I believe,

1536
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:29,160
Tiger Claw pointed this out, CompUSA was listing a Nintendo Wii for $1,100, and I thought the

1537
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,760
Wii was supposed to be the affordable system.

1538
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,160
That's Canadian.

1539
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:39,920
Needless to say, someone's getting fired.

1540
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,000
Maybe we should make this oopsie thing a regular segment.

1541
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,960
There certainly are enough mistakes going on out there.

1542
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,680
I don't know what to say about that.

1543
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,400
Apparently the Wii thing is still up.

1544
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,320
Tiger Claw is posting a link in our chat right now.

1545
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:56,720
Let me go ahead and do that, and I'll paste that in right now.

1546
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,280
I know this is wonderful radio here.

1547
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,240
Oh yeah, there it is.

1548
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:06,540
Wii console, $1,119.06.

1549
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,720
Someone made a little bit of a mistake there.

1550
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,120
Good job, CompUSA.

1551
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,120
Leaking games early, selling Wiis for a couple of times.

1552
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,160
That's got to be one hell of a Wii.

1553
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,560
It better have other Wii attachments with it.

1554
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,640
Like the Mantennen.

1555
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,640
And the Penetrator.

1556
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,640
And the Love Hamster.

1557
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:33,160
Every week DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth

1558
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:39,920
and all around, and she finds a website appropriate to share with y'all.

1559
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,480
Is it killer7.com, your website of the week this week?

1560
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
No.

1561
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,480
Okay.

1562
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:51,720
She's got a website of the week, and she's going to share it with you right now.

1563
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:58,040
Today's website of the week is the Misadventures of Hello Cthulhu.

1564
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:03,160
It's a really messed up little webcomic that one of my friends in the Doctor Who fandom

1565
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,960
linked to me, that's about Cthulhu being dropped in the Hello Kitty universe.

1566
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:15,560
Yes, the Elder God, Cthulhu in the Hello Kitty universe, with ribbons on his tentacles.

1567
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:19,320
It's very funny, and I recommend everybody go read it all the way through, because trust

1568
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:26,560
me, it sort of has continuity, but not really, because it's just messed up, especially when

1569
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:33,960
he turns Keropi into his evil minion, the demon Keropi.

1570
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:43,240
So the site is, and I will link it in the chatroom, www.hello-cthulhu.com, hellokuthulu.com,

1571
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,660
with a dash in there.

1572
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:48,740
And it's really messed up, especially also when the shark pirate captain shows up and

1573
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,740
they steal his stuff.

1574
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,240
Has Batsmaru in it at all, my favorite?

1575
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,880
I haven't seen Batsmaru yet, I've seen Pompompurin, and I've also seen the tentacle monster version

1576
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,120
of Pompompurin too.

1577
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:04,400
My favorite part is when they go to the island and are attacked by the cheese grater monster.

1578
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,000
It's really random, I recommend it.

1579
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,840
If you liked Kawaii Knot, Hello Cthulhu is even worse.

1580
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,880
Hey, before we get to the next story, I want to point out that Nintendo Maniac 64 in our

1581
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:23,080
chatroom noticed that that amount that they were charging for the Wii on CompUSA, $1,119,

1582
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,080
is the release date of the Wii, $1,119.

1583
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,380
Good job, good eyes.

1584
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:30,540
So somebody just screwed up when putting things in the database and put the date where the

1585
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:35,640
price goes, and oops, and caused panic amongst game bloggers everywhere.

1586
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,640
What can you do?

1587
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:41,920
Well there is a little bit more news that I have for everybody.

1588
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,760
Something that may interest somebody in the room, except I think she already knows about

1589
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,800
it, is the LocoRoco Halloween demo.

1590
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:58,240
It also comes with a firmware update for the PSP, bringing it to 2.82.

1591
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:07,200
Basically according to our expert friends at Sony, who again, expert is used very loosely,

1592
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:12,580
it has the extras, things that are changed, we think we've covered all this before, but

1593
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,480
you don't really need it to play the LocoRoco demo.

1594
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:22,860
You can still play it with 2.71 firmware.

1595
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:28,440
For European gamers, you can download the firmware update from yourpsp.com, or you can

1596
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,960
also use the US one, it doesn't really matter.

1597
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,840
The LocoRoco demo is available online.

1598
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,000
It also has a US and European version.

1599
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,320
I wonder if anyone is going to dress up as a LocoRoco for Halloween.

1600
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,320
That would be kind of cute.

1601
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,320
I'm not.

1602
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,320
I'm going to be a pirate.

1603
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,640
I don't have a costume picked out yet.

1604
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,120
I never pick out my costume until the day of Halloween, actually.

1605
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,600
I've got this long wig.

1606
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,200
I'm going to be a pirate.

1607
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,200
Arr.

1608
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,440
Okay, by the way, I made a mistake.

1609
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:58,840
It was actually Black Boy who noticed it first, that the CompUSA screw up.

1610
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:03,160
Nintendo Maniac was just the first to type it in all caps, so I saw it.

1611
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:06,920
Not to encourage you all in chat to type in all caps, damn you.

1612
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:10,880
All right, it's getting towards the end of this segment, so that means it's time to hear

1613
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,480
a little bit of new DDR music.

1614
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:18,200
For the past eight weeks, if you can believe it, we have been premiering new songs from

1615
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,360
Dance Dance Revolution Universe, which will be coming out on the Xbox 360, sounds like

1616
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:27,920
next year, and DDR Ultramix 4, which I believe is next month.

1617
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,920
It's in November.

1618
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,880
I believe is when it's coming out, right, Loki?

1619
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,360
Ultramix 4 is in November still?

1620
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,800
Yes, Ultramix 4 is November 15th, last we heard.

1621
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,800
All right.

1622
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,200
I think the bundle's delayed a week, which is weird.

1623
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,520
They did the same thing with Supernova.

1624
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
I don't know why.

1625
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,520
Hmm.

1626
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
Maybe.

1627
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,480
All right, well, anyway, we have some new songs for you guys, so you can check out some

1628
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,080
of the songs you'll be able to dance to in these new games.

1629
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,360
We're going to start off this last batch of songs with a song from DDR Universe.

1630
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:58,600
It's a group called Geomancer, and the song is called Hydrasound, and it's going to start

1631
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:14,920
off our previews tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1632
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:42,920
It's called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound,

1633
01:26:42,920 --> 01:27:10,920

1634
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:36,200
called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound.

1635
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:41,280
And that was Hydrasound by Geomancer here on the DDR Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio

1636
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,240
coming soon to DDR Universe.

1637
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,640
All right, let's go into our next song.

1638
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,400
It's from DDR UltraMix 4.

1639
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,960
It's by an artist called Steve Porter, and the song is called Sock'em, and it's coming

1640
01:27:51,960 --> 01:28:00,960
to DDR UltraMix 4.

1641
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:27,600
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Sock'em, and the song is called

1642
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:45,920
Hydrasound.

1643
01:28:45,920 --> 01:29:13,920
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.

1644
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:41,680
All right, we're getting down to the end here, and we have our last song we're going to preview

1645
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:47,320
here from DDR Universe, and it's from an artist you might have recognized from the UltraMix

1646
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:52,320
series because this artist showed up in quite a few of the games, or if is has a song in

1647
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,560
DDR Universe, and it's called The Hop, and you're going to hear it right now on the DDR

1648
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:22,000
Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:50,000
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.

1650
01:30:50,000 --> 01:31:18,000
All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.

1651
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And now, the very last song of our DDR previews, and before we get to this, I just want to

1652
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,720
say a big thanks to Konami of Hawaii for giving us the opportunity to give you guys something

1653
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,840
a little bit special here, obviously.

1654
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:52,980
If you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, you know that we've always been longtime supporters

1655
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:57,240
of music-based games, and of course, DDR being at the forefront of that, and it's very cool

1656
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:03,720
that Konami took a chance on independent radio with this type of news, so it's very cool,

1657
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,880
so thanks guys so much.

1658
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:10,180
And we're going to go into a song here from DDR UltraMix IV, and it's by a group called

1659
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:14,520
Blue October, but it's not the same Blue October.

1660
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,140
This is Blue October UK, not the Blue October that sings that,

1661
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:23,360
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

1662
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,520
This band's a lot less emo.

1663
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,640
They're on the different drum label.

1664
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:31,160
This is a song called Free, the Liberation Mix, and it's coming to DDR UltraMix IV.

1665
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,160
Enjoy.

1666
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,160
Blue October UK.

1667
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:49,560
This is Blue October UK, not the Blue October that sings that.

1668
01:32:49,560 --> 01:33:06,240
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

1669
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:29,040
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

1670
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:55,000
Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.

1671
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:14,360
Free, the Liberation Mix, by Blue October UK, here on Orange Lounge Radio, the last

1672
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,200
song in our DDR sneak peeks.

1673
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,840
And that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

1674
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:23,680
So did you guys like those songs?

1675
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,680
I thought it was pretty good.

1676
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:25,680
I liked that last one, especially.

1677
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,480
It was kind of light and airy and trance-y.

1678
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,360
It was a little too trance-y.

1679
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,360
Yeah, you're not a big trance fan, huh?

1680
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,880
You said you liked the one.

1681
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,680
What did we play in there?

1682
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,800
The Steve Porter one.

1683
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,800
You said you liked that one.

1684
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,800
Yes?

1685
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,800
Dark Saga?

1686
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,800
Quit taking pictures with your phone.

1687
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:41,800
You liked the Steve Porter one, though.

1688
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,800
Yes?

1689
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,800
It was all right.

1690
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,800
Yeah?

1691
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,800
All right.

1692
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:46,800
Good times.

1693
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,320
I'm going to be starting a new feature on our website, by the way, that's going to be

1694
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,720
my phone cam picture of the show.

1695
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:51,960
Oh, God.

1696
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,960
A very unflattering picture.

1697
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:59,040
You can see me trying to, because now I'm experimenting with facial hair this week.

1698
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,720
It's the first time in my life I've tried to grow a beard here, so it's something new.

1699
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:07,200
As far as the DDR sneak previews, I liked the Orifice one.

1700
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:13,680
I've actually met Zonk live, and actually, the Orifice guy is the producer for Zonk,

1701
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,920
so yeah, I really liked the Orifice one.

1702
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,960
It was really kind of different.

1703
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:18,960
Yeah.

1704
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:24,280
Now, I have to admit, the songs in the previous games weren't so hot to me, but that one I

1705
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,280
liked.

1706
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,520
I can see myself really playing that one, and I liked Zonk a lot.

1707
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,960
I liked their remix of Love This Feelin' that they did previously, so I know it was kind

1708
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,600
of a controversial song in the community.

1709
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,360
Some folks are like, why did they do that song?

1710
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,440
But I liked it, so pretty cool.

1711
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,440
All right.

1712
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,480
Well, we are going to say goodbye for now, but we'll be back in a little bit with Orange

1713
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:49,720

days.
