7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.
14000	17000	Tonight, October 29th, 2006,
17000	20000	Halo Movie News and Halo 3 tidbits,
20000	22000	Sony and UK Importers go to war,
22000	27000	and could custom character creation cause trouble for one gaming company?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	39000	Hello everybody out there in the land of internet broadcasting and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
39000	44000	It is episode number 206 for this, October 29th, 2006.
44000	49000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know,
49000	51000	gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.
51000	52000	I'm here to help you through that.
52000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts.
53000	54000	You might know me as Sky.
54000	58000	If you're joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-hosts over there in that corner,
58000	60000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
60000	63000	I've taken a vow of silence for five seconds.
63000	65000	Great, then I'll introduce Loki.
65000	67000	I give up.
67000	69000	How are you doing? Seriously though, Jamie?
69000	71000	Head.
71000	72000	You have a little headache?
72000	73000	Little.
73000	74000	I'm sorry.
74000	75000	It was a migraine earlier, but I feel a lot better now.
75000	77000	I'm very hyper thanks to my coffee.
77000	79000	Oh goody, we have a hyper Jamie tonight.
79000	81000	That always makes for a fun show.
81000	82000	And you forgot.
82000	83000	What?
83000	85000	When are we going to set that thing on fire?
85000	86000	Nine.
86000	88000	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
88000	89000	Hello.
89000	90000	How you doing?
90000	91000	Good.
91000	92000	How'd the move go?
92000	93000	It went good.
93000	96000	I'm just, you know, without internet until tomorrow.
96000	97000	That's got to stink.
97000	102000	Not really, because I just play, well actually it's been so busy with unpacking, you know,
102000	105000	last minute apartment stuff and all that stuff.
105000	108000	Really haven't had a chance to like sit down.
108000	113240	But I have been stealing my neighbor's wireless, but it only seems to work for about five minutes
113240	114240	at a time.
114240	119520	So, you know, I get on there real quickly and read, you know, news and try to check
119520	121080	my email and that doesn't always work.
121080	124400	Have you tried to look at the shared folders on the network to see if there's like porn?
124400	129760	Actually, her network is unsecured, but her shared folders are password protected.
129760	130760	Interesting.
130760	134000	So, they got it halfway right.
134000	138840	Not that we endorse stealing Wi-Fi, but hey, if you're going to leave it open, people might
138840	139840	use it.
139840	140840	All right.
140840	143680	We have a special guest for this tonight, and this is nice because we actually have
143680	146480	someone who I believe has never been on the program before.
146480	149280	So it's nice to have some new blood on the show once in a while.
149280	150280	So say hello everyone to Renee.
150280	151280	Yay.
151280	152280	Hi.
152280	153280	I'm here.
153280	154280	How you doing Renee?
154280	155280	I'm good.
155280	157680	Don't be afraid to just put that mic right up to your mic because they're not that sensitive
157680	158680	unfortunately.
158680	159680	All right.
159680	160680	This is better.
160680	162960	Their emotions are sensitive though, so don't make fun of them.
162960	165160	We just want to make sure they can all hear you.
165160	166160	All right.
166160	168160	So you've been a listener of Orange Launch for a little while, right?
168160	169160	Yeah.
169160	170160	Because you've sent us emails before.
170160	171160	Yes, I have.
171160	175280	And I think I joked previously, like on one of the episodes a few weeks ago, that Renee
175280	176280	needs...
176280	179520	Or I said something about like she needs to come to the show or I'm going to take her
179520	183800	on my trip and I'm going to put her in a box and poke holes in it because I've met Renee
183800	184800	before.
184800	188760	Renee and I run into each other at weird places like E3 and the...
188760	189920	Your friend's concert at Final Fantasy.
189920	190920	I remember that.
190920	194880	We ran into each other at the very first-year friend's concert in L.A.
194880	196600	But you were here and you brought your box with you, I saw.
196600	197600	Yes, I brought my box.
197600	199600	It has holes.
199600	205780	Now, kids on the internet who are going to read into that statement, just freaking clean
205780	206780	up right now.
206780	209200	I'm going to come over there and wash out your brain with soap.
209200	210200	All right.
210200	211200	Anyway.
211200	212200	But how are you doing?
212200	213200	Good.
213200	214200	Good.
214200	215640	So what kind of a gamer are you?
215640	217160	What kind of games do you like to play?
217160	219200	What kind of stuff do you like?
219200	226440	At heart, I am a console gamer, so I've been playing a couple of PC games recently.
226440	234040	Actually, last week, I tapped into my tabletop gaming and I was playing some Hero Quest,
234040	235040	so...
235040	236040	Wow.
236040	242000	So I guess I like RPGs, rhythm and simulation-type games, puzzles, so...
242000	243000	All right.
243000	244000	Very cool.
244000	246440	The typical gamer girl.
246440	249040	Well, welcome to the program.
249040	250040	Thank you.
250040	251040	Now, something occurred to me this morning.
251040	253600	You actually, at one point, worked in the industry a little bit, didn't you?
253600	254600	I still do, actually.
254600	255600	You do?
255600	256600	Yes, I do.
256600	257600	Really?
257600	258600	You used to work at Konami a couple of years ago.
258600	259600	I did.
259600	260600	I used to work at Konami.
260600	261600	That's where I actually started off.
261600	266880	I have been in the DDR community for a while, and that's when I started listening to Orange
266880	271200	Lounge Radio, because that's where all the cool kids went to, they listened to Orange
271200	272200	Lounge.
272200	273200	Love the endorsement.
273200	274200	Love it.
274200	275200	Thank you.
275200	279720	I met Mike Noh, also known as Asian Innovation.
279720	283080	Best rapper ever.
283080	285960	Not if you have to deal with him rapping at work, I'll tell you that.
285960	287680	No, but his drunken rap's pretty funny.
287680	291260	Oh my God, it is pretty funny.
291260	297120	And so I met him, and he said, you know, do you like video games?
297120	298120	I'm like, yeah.
298120	300600	And he's like, would you like to be a video game tester at Konami?
300600	302320	And I said, sure.
302320	304920	And so that's where I started off at Konami.
304920	310760	I started doing step data, and then I moved into functionality QA testing.
310760	316600	And then I left QA to go pursue other career.
316600	317600	It happens.
317600	318600	It happens.
318600	319600	You move on.
319600	320600	Yeah.
320600	324120	And then actually I went back into the video game industry to go to LucasArts, and I was
324120	325520	a QA tester there.
325520	329280	I did compliance testing, so that's like standards, first party standards.
329280	333800	So you know, testing to make sure that if we are developing a game for Microsoft or
333800	339000	Sony that they have the right terminology, or it doesn't fail.
339000	341440	That's what I've heard from some people in the industry, is that those companies are
341440	349200	very strict on, you know, you have to call this button like the Xbox 360 guide button.
349200	353240	And you can't say, oh, that center silver glowing button, or the silver button on the
353240	355320	controller, it has to be the guide button.
355320	356320	Exactly.
356320	363600	And you know, Microsoft and especially Sony, they're very stringent that you have to use
363600	370080	like their controller layout, like if you're going to show it on screen or in the manual,
370080	374520	it has to look exactly like it, or else, you know, they'll be very angry at you.
374520	376160	Bad things happen, yeah.
376160	377160	That's interesting.
377160	381240	So there's a lot more that goes into putting a game like on the multi-platform than you
381240	382240	might think at first.
382240	383240	Definitely.
383240	384240	Oh, definitely.
384240	389440	I've seen games fail submission from, you know, going into production just because of
389440	396440	the fact that, you know, the message that comes up when you unplug your controller wasn't
396440	397440	correct.
397440	398440	Wow.
398440	399440	Yeah.
399440	400440	That's a lot of money, too.
400440	407000	It's like at least a couple thousand each time you submit to Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo.
407000	408000	Wow.
408000	409000	Yes.
409000	410000	Interesting.
410000	411000	Well, thanks for the insight.
411000	412000	That's pretty awesome.
412000	413000	No problem.
413000	417480	And right now, I'm working at Perpetual Entertainment.
417480	421280	They haven't come up with any games yet, but the two games that they do have in development
421280	425000	is Gods and Heroes, Roam Rising, and Star Trek Online.
425000	426000	Oh.
426000	427000	Star Trek.
427000	428000	Star Trek Online?
428000	429000	Yes.
429000	430000	Star Trek Online.
430000	431000	Awesome.
431000	432000	Oh, that's something I might get into.
432000	433000	I'm the resident Trekkie.
433000	434000	I'm a closet Trekkie, a little bit.
434000	435000	Shh.
435000	436000	Don't tell anyone.
436000	437000	Okay.
437000	438000	But I like Trek.
438000	441000	So you're in the closet for some things, but out of the closet for us.
441000	442000	Yes.
442000	443000	Appreciate that.
443000	446000	I'm still kidnapping you to go see Warp 11.
446000	447000	Yeah, yeah.
447000	448000	All right.
448000	449000	Well, cool.
449000	450000	That's very cool.
450000	451000	So this is very neat.
451000	454440	And of course, our chat room is very excited to see another gamer girl on the show over
454440	456160	at Orangelaunchradio.com.
456160	457160	Click on Chat.
457160	459120	We have some folks in the chat room there.
459120	462480	Fireboma is reminding us that free advertisement doesn't work on your own station.
462480	466000	So these plugs for Orange Launch Radio don't really do anything here.
466000	467000	Let's see.
467000	468000	What else here?
468000	473200	DMN says that DNL is his hero, because your name in the online world is DNL.
473200	474200	Yes, it is.
474200	475660	So DNL is DMN's hero.
475660	476660	That's a lot of initials.
476660	478160	We have alphabet soup going on here.
478160	479160	All right.
479160	483100	Well, let's get into what we do at the top of every show and talk about our gaming week.
483100	484760	So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
484760	485760	I played stuff, actually.
485760	486760	Really?
486760	487760	What did you play?
487760	490720	Well, we had a barbecue at my place last night that somebody who was invited didn't show
490720	491720	up for.
491720	492720	Sorry, other things, you know.
492720	493720	That's okay.
493720	494720	Busy boy.
494720	495720	I have to tease.
495720	498480	But we broke out the 360 and played.
498480	501520	Okay, we had to see how awful the Sonic demo was.
501520	505440	Dan's actually pretty damn good at controlling that, but it's still awful.
505440	509960	And it was funny, our friend Alex was over, and Alex is an ex-Marine.
509960	515400	He takes it very seriously, and he was just, he could have been a drill sergeant.
515400	520040	His voice is like, this is making my head explode!
520040	521920	So that was pretty funny.
521920	526040	And then they put up the fear demo, but it was actually cool, because Alex had been playing
526040	531880	it on PC and was going through the differences between the PC and the Xbox 360 in his opinion.
531880	535600	He said it was actually pretty damn close.
535600	540280	And I have to say that I'm probably going to play fear if I don't get motion sick from
540280	541280	it.
541280	544680	The demo did not make me that motion sick, because first-person shooters always do that
544680	546120	to me.
546120	549840	I love, though, the very freaky element of, Dan's like, okay, watch this, this is about
549840	551400	to get all Silent Hill.
551400	552400	Look!
552400	554680	I was like, ooh, blood.
554680	560400	I actually, I did hang out with Jamie this week outside the show, which was fun.
560400	564000	And I got to see the walkthrough of the fear demo as well, and it looked pretty neat.
564000	567780	I don't usually get into first-person shooters, but I like the whole freaky element that fear
567780	568780	has going on.
568780	572560	And I kind of miss it on the PC, you know, I just, I don't do a whole lot of gaming on
572560	573560	the PC.
573560	575560	I apologize to our PC gamer fans.
575560	579240	There's a couple once in a while that'll make me look, but fear's maybe something I'll look
579240	581200	at on the console, for sure.
581200	587260	Well, apart from that, I actually played my first game, well actually I had Dan play it
587260	590600	for me, because I was sort of, my eyes hurt.
590600	596940	So he played Uno on my gamertag, and my first game was one with a draw four.
596940	597940	So I was like, hey!
597940	602520	And then we saw somebody picking their nose on the webcam.
602520	607480	That's pretty tame compared to a lot of things I've heard that people are seeing on Uno webcams.
607480	609880	Nothing is as fun as Dan shit-talking, though.
609880	610880	That's just really funny.
610880	611880	But he doesn't do it in the microphone.
611880	612880	No.
612880	615140	But it was really funny to just hear him, you know, sit there and shit-talk all these
615140	617600	people, they can't hear them, but it's really funny.
617600	624320	But I also, I bought PSU yesterday, and got around to playing a little bit today.
624320	627680	Phantasy Star Universe, for those not in the know.
627680	628680	Yeah.
628680	633220	I couldn't, for some reason I couldn't get online, it said that my thing was interrupted
633220	634600	or something by the server.
634600	635880	I was like...
635880	636880	Oh!
636880	637880	Try backing out and going back in.
637880	638880	I did.
638880	639880	Didn't work.
639880	640880	Really?
640880	641880	There might have weird server things.
641880	644000	Well, at any rate, if that doesn't work, I'm just gonna change out the credit card
644000	649760	I used, because I used my ATM card, but my bank has weird authorization things.
649760	654640	So I'm going to try it again later, but I did play a little bit in story mode, and it's
654640	658040	like uber-automé, cliche the game.
658040	659040	It's not bad.
659040	660040	It's pretty.
660040	664560	I'm like, okay, but the voice acting sort of irritates me, and hearing the main song
664560	666760	in English irritates me as well.
666760	670060	I was like, whoever they got to sing just can't.
670060	675600	I have a very bad problem with professional singers who are tone deaf, because that's
675600	677820	what this lady sounded like.
677820	681960	And so that was really it for my gaming week.
681960	686280	I did try to play a little bit of Pirate King, but I had some computer issues, and I think
686280	687840	I'm just not going to play that anymore.
687840	689480	It got kind of boring really fast.
689480	690940	Oh, that's too bad.
690940	693600	It's a cute game, just boring.
693600	697400	Alex in our chatroom offers some advice, says, yeah, Jamie, it's been doing that to everyone.
697400	701680	You'll have to keep trying until it works, in regards to Phantasy Star Universe.
701680	705120	It did that to me once, but then when I went back in, it worked, so I don't know.
705120	713520	Well, I'm thinking that I'm going to try to recreate my ranger chick that kicked ass.
713520	714520	All right.
714520	715520	Well, good luck to you.
715520	719480	Hopefully I can, but I'm still pissed off, though, about not being able to make a really
719480	721480	girly man.
721480	725040	We'll have to party up together sometime, but it'll have to wait a couple weeks, because
725040	728720	12's out this week, and that's going to be my life for a couple weeks.
728720	737640	I also, though, would like to give a public shout out to the GameStop on Sunrise, because
737640	744320	you guys had some of the best customer service, despite the fact that you know my husband.
744320	747200	You guys are really, really great, and I have to give a shout out.
747200	749860	Now, one thing we should point out, because obviously most of our listeners don't live
749860	753080	in the Sacramento area, but the GameStop on Sunrise is funny, because right across the
753080	754960	street is a mall with a GameStop in it.
754960	757680	So these two are within walking distance of each other.
757680	758680	It's kind of crazy.
758680	763040	They were a very busy store, but for as busy as they were, I was noticing that they were
763040	768360	trying to give everybody attention, and that, to me, was just really kind of refreshing
768360	769720	to see at a GameStop.
769720	773120	That's good advice for any employees that we might have that listen to this show, because
773120	777240	I know we do have some employees of certain games, not just GameStop, but GameCrazy, all
777240	778240	the other ones, too, listen to this.
778240	782560	My hubby is no longer associated with GameStop, but that still doesn't mean I hate him.
782560	783560	All right.
783560	785080	Let's go over to Loki.
785080	786080	How was your gaming week?
786080	787080	I didn't play too much.
787080	792200	I played Saints Row, finished the Vice King storyline, so now I'm a quarter of the way
792200	793200	through the game.
793200	798440	I started the West Side Rollers storyline, and I don't know.
798440	799440	It's still fun.
799440	804400	I still play it every lunch, usually causing some sort of mayhem and trying to find new
804400	812320	ways to die or explode or just glitches in the game, and yeah, it's really entertaining.
812320	818320	I played the Tony Hawk's Project 8 demo, and I don't care for it one bit.
818320	819880	It's a great game, I'm sure.
819880	821320	It's just too technical now.
821320	827280	If you aren't really into Tony Hawk and you're picking this up the first time to go into
827280	830320	it, you're going to have trouble doing a lot of stuff.
830320	835560	I felt an awful lot, whereas Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it was fucking easy.
835560	839860	It was fun to be able to pull off crazy stuff, and it wasn't too hard.
839860	844280	Now they're just giving you way too much damn control over stuff, and I think that'd be
844280	847600	good if you know what you're doing, but if you don't know what you're doing, that's not
847600	848600	really good.
848600	849600	I don't know.
849600	850600	It's pretty, though.
850600	855600	What was the other demo I was going to try?
855600	863120	I meant to try Rainbow Six, but we were supposed to be playing in our theater at work, but
863120	867960	we didn't get a chance to do that, so I didn't play it.
867960	871920	Or Need for Speed Most Wanted, actually, because I'm trying to finish up the game before Carbon
871920	880720	comes out, and I'm about halfway through that now, so that's good.
880720	884040	Waiting for Vice City Stories, it's coming out on Tuesday, so we'll be able to switch
884040	888440	out the game pretty soon, so I'll have a full review of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories
888440	889440	next week.
889440	896480	In the meantime, though, we are finishing up Liberty City Stories, and I am still kicking
896480	905400	major ass in our killing spree at work, and so far I'm ahead by, I think, 30 kills, which
905400	906400	is awesome.
906400	907400	All right.
907400	908400	Anything else?
908400	909400	No.
909400	910400	All right.
910400	913880	Then I can talk about my gaming week.
913880	918260	First off, it's been a little while since we've done a show, because we pre-taped last
918260	920680	week on Wednesday, because we did all that traveling.
920680	922400	How was YowieCon, by the way?
922400	923400	Dark Sakura.
923400	924400	I forgot another game I played.
924400	925400	Oh, what's that?
925400	928720	I downloaded Luminous for mobile, and it's actually pretty fun.
928720	929720	Yeah?
929720	930720	For a mobile game?
930720	931720	I've been playing Shinin.
931720	932720	I usually don't, really, Shinin's on the mobile version.
932720	935360	Here, I'll tell you what, I'll play it up in a second, because I can get it to play
935360	936360	through the mic.
936360	937360	All right.
937360	938360	Do it after.
938360	939360	But YowieCon was fun.
939360	945240	I forgot to mention, I played Luminous live, and eh, eh, eh.
945240	946240	It's not the same as PSP.
946240	949920	I don't think it's worth spending the $15.
949920	950920	I just don't know.
950920	951920	For half the game?
951920	952920	Yeah.
952920	953920	For half the PSP version?
953920	954920	Yeah.
954920	955920	I don't know.
955920	960280	It's okay, I guess, but I have problems with some of the graphics in there.
960280	965080	Some of the tilesets that they have are hard to see, and it really hurts my eyes to try
965080	967280	to concentrate on it.
967280	971480	If they had an option to keep a specific tileset and just change the music or something, that
971480	972480	would be great.
972480	975840	Well, you can do that in a different mode, but then you don't unlock new skins, because
975840	977880	you can do a skin rotate.
977880	981520	You can set the order of the skins as they show up, but then if you don't play through
981520	984740	the regular mode, you can't unlock skins to use in that mode, so it's kind of a double
984740	985740	edged sword.
985740	989600	And then there's the achievement in order to use that mode or whatever, you have to
989600	994480	unlock a ton of different skins, but the problem is you have to score 500,000 points, and the
994480	999500	only way you're able to do that with one play through is you have to buy the other packs.
999500	1003120	So in order to get certain achievements, you have to buy the other packs.
1003120	1006680	Thank you very much Cute Entertainment.
1006680	1009280	My Gaming Week, I played Phantasy Star Universe.
1009280	1012980	Now I can finally talk about it, because I've played the commercial release, and so I feel
1012980	1015920	a little better giving a full review of this game.
1015920	1021480	I like Phantasy Star Universe a lot because it's different from other MMOs because it's
1021480	1024640	a little more action oriented from what you're used to.
1024640	1030280	Final Fantasy World of Warcraft have action elements, but in the end I feel that Phantasy
1030280	1035200	Star Universe is a lot more action oriented than the others.
1035200	1039080	It kind of feels like a 3D Diablo, that's kind of what Phantasy Star Online was.
1039080	1043200	Phantasy Star Universe takes a lot of what was started in Phantasy Star Online and just
1043200	1048680	improves on it, so it's really a good sequel, solid sequel to Phantasy Star Online.
1048680	1052960	I do love the fact that they put in a single player mode, and it's actually surprisingly
1052960	1053960	decent.
1053960	1058120	I thought it was going to be kind of a write off crappy thing, but the story is not half
1058120	1059120	bad.
1059120	1063880	I love the way how they have it set up like a cheesy anime type thing, but I agree with
1063880	1068160	Jamie that whoever is singing that opening song is pretty bad, but a lot of animes have
1068160	1072360	cheesy openings, but literally you play the game in chapters, and every chapter starts
1072360	1075600	off with the same cheesy anime-ish opening.
1075600	1079000	It's not actual anime, but they use the in-game engine and do it, but you'll see what I mean.
1079000	1080920	It's set up just like an anime.
1080920	1085680	But the funny thing is when you beat a chapter, then it goes like, next time on Phantasy Star
1085680	1086680	Universe.
1086680	1090160	It's really funny, so I love the way it's set up, and I don't think the story is that
1090160	1091160	bad.
1091160	1094080	The only thing I don't like is that there's odd loading in cut scenes.
1094080	1095880	They don't load the cut scene all at once.
1095880	1098720	They'll load half, and then there's a cut scene, and then they do another.
1098720	1104400	It's kind of weird, so it's got some weird loading issues, but you kind of get over that.
1104400	1110520	The other thing I think that doesn't settle well with me in Phantasy Star Universe is
1110520	1115840	that it seems like the gameplay might seem to get a little repetitive towards the end,
1115840	1121240	but they've added a lot of different types of weapons and certain types of spells that
1121240	1122240	you can use.
1122240	1125840	I don't know if this game is necessarily going to be for everyone, but if you check
1125840	1129360	out the beta and you liked it, I'd say give the commercial release a try.
1129360	1132280	You don't have to put up with the online stuff if you don't want to because the single player
1132280	1133400	mode is pretty decent.
1133400	1134880	It's a decent game.
1134880	1141080	I don't know if it's $60, but there's the PlayStation 2 and PC ones available I think
1141080	1142200	a little bit cheaper.
1142200	1145360	But I'm going to play this for a little while, but I don't know if I'd play this more than
1145360	1146360	like three months.
1146360	1148740	I think the magic will be gone in a few months, but we'll see.
1148740	1151800	It's all up to Sega, and are they going to keep it new and keep it fresh and keep it
1151800	1152800	updated?
1152800	1157640	Right now I worry a little bit because they are having some server problems, but I suppose
1157640	1158640	it's early on.
1158640	1159640	They just launched a big game.
1159640	1163800	There's going to be a few issues, but hopefully those will fix themselves because I know they
1163800	1169160	had a lot of game maintenance problems with Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox, and I'd
1169160	1171880	really hate to see the same thing happen with the universe.
1171880	1177160	So fan community, speak up when things are going wrong, and hopefully Sega will be listening.
1177160	1183760	I do recommend Phantasy Star Universe to fans of role-playing type games, and I would say
1183760	1187400	the closest thing I could really compare it to that's not online would be something like,
1187400	1192080	I don't know, it feels a little bit like Zelda to me, a little bit, but maybe with less puzzle
1192080	1193080	element.
1193080	1196120	I will say though that some of the scenery in Phantasy Star Universe is gorgeous.
1196120	1200320	There's a planet that has a very old Asia type theme to it.
1200320	1202200	It's really gorgeous, some of the areas there.
1202200	1206920	So it's really a step up graphically from PSO, which got kind of old with the graphics
1206920	1210360	after playing it a little while.
1210360	1213880	Let's see, the other game I want to talk about really quickly is Clubhouse Games for the
1213880	1217040	DS because I picked it up, but I haven't really talked about it on the show.
1217040	1218040	It's pretty cool.
1218040	1222840	There's a lot, a lot of games on it, and I think that value alone makes it worth a purchase
1222840	1224440	if you're into the casual games.
1224440	1228640	If you're not into casual games, you want something with more depth, I don't think there's
1228640	1230040	going to be a whole lot here for you.
1230040	1234560	They try to make it a little longer gameplay and kind of streamline it all together with
1234560	1239520	things like mission mode and stamp mode, but overall it's nothing more than just an excuse
1239520	1241200	to make you try every single game.
1241200	1246440	I was a little disappointed that online doesn't have certain games in it, so be careful before
1246440	1247440	you pick up the game.
1247440	1250920	Check out, do some research online and see if the games you want to play online are even
1250920	1256560	playable because they aren't all playable online, so be careful.
1256560	1260200	If you want, I have that music queued up so people can hear what it sounds like.
1260200	1261560	If it'll come through, hopefully.
1261560	1262560	It should.
1262560	1263560	I'm starting the level over.
1263560	1266680	Oh, it's like a cheesy mini version of it, I can hear it.
1266680	1271680	Yeah, it's like a cheesy mini version of it.
1271680	1273000	I guess for a phone it's not bad.
1273000	1276640	It'll pick up in a second.
1276640	1285360	Now, see, this makes me kind of go, why isn't this on the Xbox Live one?
1285360	1288120	This is like the best song in the game, and they got it on the frickin' cell phone, but
1288120	1290000	they didn't get it on Xbox Live?
1290000	1291000	That's weird.
1291000	1292000	Oh, well.
1292000	1293000	Anyway, thank you, Jamie.
1293000	1295440	I think it turned out pretty nicely.
1295440	1297280	Yeah, for a cell phone game, that's not bad.
1297280	1299280	You know I hate cell phone games, usually.
1299280	1300280	Anyway.
1300280	1301680	Renee, how was your gaming week?
1301680	1303880	What kind of games have you been playing?
1303880	1310840	Besides the HeroQuest, I have been playing Clubhouse games as well.
1310840	1316000	I don't really have Wi-Fi set up at my house, and so I've been stealing Wi-Fi from the Metreon
1316000	1318800	because I live in San Francisco.
1318800	1325200	The only game that I've actually been able to play online is Darts, and it's fine.
1325200	1329680	But I do understand that if there are some games that you do like and you want to check,
1329680	1334320	you definitely want to check out and see if you can play it online, because I really was
1334320	1338560	looking forward to playing Split, or Spit, or Speed.
1338560	1340800	That was the one I wanted to do, too.
1340800	1344080	And yeah, because I totally kill on that, so I'm awesome.
1344080	1345080	We should play it together.
1345080	1348640	See, we should have totally battled, but we can't, because we can't play it on the internet.
1348640	1351040	Don't cry.
1351040	1353520	I've also played LocoRoco.
1353520	1354760	I really love that game.
1354760	1358440	I've beat it like two times now, and it's really cute.
1358440	1367160	Basically it's made by SCEI, or Sony Computer Detainment International, which is Sony.
1367160	1372560	Basically you play as a world, and there's these little LocoRocos that are these little
1372560	1382640	yellow blobs, and you help them roll around and get rid of the mojos that are trying to
1382640	1385880	invade the world, and that's basically it.
1385880	1392080	I guess the closest you can compare it to would be Katamari Damacy, but it's not really.
1392080	1396680	It's kind of hard when you have these very original games to try and compare it to something
1396680	1397680	else.
1397680	1398680	Definitely.
1398680	1400480	Probably people were going, like, Fantasy Star Universe is like Zelda.
1400480	1401480	What the hell is he saying?
1401480	1402480	I don't know.
1402480	1403480	Is it a sword-slashing thing?
1403480	1404480	I don't know.
1404480	1405480	I don't know.
1405480	1407560	It's the best thing I can name.
1407560	1412280	The reason why I actually started playing LocoRoco again, because I basically beat it
1412280	1418560	about a month ago, was because I had gone to visit the Sony store at the Metreon, or
1418560	1424040	PlayStation store, and they had this little booth set up, and they had these little inflatable
1424040	1425040	LocoRocos.
1425040	1432920	There was two one-foot LocoRoco inflatables, and then this one huge three-foot one.
1432920	1438440	I walked up to one of the workers there, and I said, oh, are you guys selling these?
1438440	1440960	He's like, no, actually, sorry.
1440960	1445520	I made a little pouty face, because that's what I do.
1445520	1448680	I asked him, well, can I at least look at it?
1448680	1454640	He went behind the booth, and he took the smaller one, and he handed that to me.
1454640	1460080	As soon as I had it in my grasp, I held onto it, and I gave it a quick little hug, and
1460080	1466440	I said, oh, it's so cute, like the girl I am.
1466440	1470440	Of course, his heart melted, and he's like, oh, do you want it?
1470440	1471440	I'm like, of course.
1471440	1474200	He's like, well, you can have it for free.
1474200	1475200	Here it is with her today.
1475200	1480200	It's here with me today, and before he could say, I'm just kidding, I squeed, and I just
1480200	1481200	ran out.
1481200	1482200	I'm very happy.
1482200	1486560	He ran away before he could take it back.
1486560	1489520	That's why I started playing Loco Roco again.
1489520	1494920	Another game that I've been playing, actually, right now, I just picked up Cooking Mama.
1494920	1500880	In the Bay Area, I've visited at least five different EB's, and I've asked every single
1500880	1505040	time, every time I've gone, and this is multiple occasions, I ask, do you guys have Cooking
1505040	1506040	Mama?
1506040	1515680	As I've come to expect it, their answer is no, and like the little fangirl of Nintendo
1515680	1520060	DS games I am, I pout and walk away.
1520060	1525600	But today, when I came to visit Sacramento, I went to the EB games over in Ardenwood,
1525600	1531280	and they had Cooking Mama, and right now, Mama is telling me to poke my steak.
1531280	1534280	Wow, okay.
1534280	1540920	What kind of game is this?
1540920	1547400	This is some sick, twisted little game under the cutesy farce of a Cooking Mama title.
1547400	1550600	Hey, well, you know, whatever Mama wants, she gets.
1550600	1556920	Next year, we're going to have Cooking Emerald, where he yells out things while you're trying
1556920	1557920	to cook.
1557920	1558920	Bam!
1558920	1559920	Yeah.
1559920	1563800	Mama wants you to come over here and poke my steak.
1563800	1564800	This is dirty.
1564800	1565800	Dirty, dirty.
1565800	1566800	I'm sorry.
1566800	1568800	I think I need to get that game.
1568800	1569800	Wow.
1569800	1573840	Maybe there's some girly thing, I don't get, oh well, forget it, I don't know.
1573840	1576960	All right, well that's cool, well great, and I'm glad you brought, can I give your Loco
1576960	1577960	Rocodoll a hug?
1577960	1578960	Yes, you can, you can.
1578960	1579960	Yay!
1579960	1581560	Here I go.
1581560	1584640	This is great radio, by the way.
1584640	1586880	If only you could see Rob now, he has the biggest grin ever.
1586880	1588600	I know, it's cute, it's very cute.
1588600	1592300	I would have tried to steal one too, but you know, I would have had to find a worker there
1592300	1595800	that bats for my team, and I don't know if there are any there, so, well it is San Francisco
1595800	1596800	for God's sake.
1596800	1597800	Yes.
1597800	1600440	The official Sony store is still there at the Metreon, even though Sony sold it, right?
1600440	1601440	It is.
1601440	1602440	The Metreon itself.
1602440	1603440	Exactly.
1603440	1604440	I was at the Metreon last week.
1604440	1606200	That's right, and how was your experience at the Metreon?
1606200	1610960	I saw Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D, and I had only had three hours of sleep and it
1610960	1614880	had been going all day, so I actually fell asleep during the parts where they're handing
1614880	1615880	out all the presents.
1615880	1619920	But right at the beginning, it's me, Chris, Megzi, and Mecco, who is our friend from Canada.
1619920	1624000	We're all trying to grab the snowflakes at the beginning of the movie, and then me and
1624000	1628800	Megzi are like, ooh, Jack.
1628800	1632000	But the thing about it is that they've touched up the quality or something on it because
1632000	1637000	you can actually see the fibers move in the different clothes that are actually, like
1637000	1641560	in Sally's dress for instance, you can see the different fiber layouts different for
1641560	1645920	when they've used different doll models, you know, when they've had her up there for the
1645920	1647880	different positions and everything.
1647880	1653600	So if you go, and I think it's actually playing through, I think through December, if you
1653600	1659000	go onto, actually just do a search for it, a website will pop up for Disney, and you
1659000	1662320	can actually order your tickets through Fandango, which I highly recommend because it's going
1662320	1664200	to be sold out the whole time.
1664200	1665200	Especially this season, yeah.
1665200	1670720	Yeah, if you can see it anywhere, go see it because it's seriously, it is worth the view.
1670720	1671720	Awesome.
1671720	1672720	All right.
1672720	1674520	And sitting in line was kind of fun, but not really.
1674520	1677920	Now while you were doing that, I was in New York City and I actually met up with some
1677920	1678920	of our listeners.
1678920	1682480	So some folks came out to see me at Nintendo World, I thought there was going to be like
1682480	1686160	two people, but it turned out to be about seven, so it was cool, I was glad to see some
1686160	1688080	folks show up at Nintendo World to say hi.
1688080	1691160	So thank you very much to the New York City folks who came out and said hi, and we went
1691160	1693400	to lunch together in Times Square, it was very cool.
1693400	1698160	And hold on one minute, I'll be right back because they gave us some stuff from Digital
1698160	1699740	Life, so I'll be right back.
1699740	1705520	Next radio ever, where Rob runs out of the room, giddy like a little schoolgirl.
1705520	1706520	That's adorable.
1706520	1714440	In the meantime, the ferret will serenade everybody, and oh, Rob's back.
1714440	1716840	You could have stayed gone, this could have been a ferret show.
1716840	1720520	So I have shirts, so I don't know who wants what, but the white one seems a little more
1720520	1722080	girly, so I'm going to give the white one to Jamie.
1722080	1723080	I wear black though.
1723080	1724080	Oh, you want the black one?
1724080	1725080	What's the black one say?
1725080	1729340	The black one says, let's see, it's- If it's white, I won't wear it.
1729340	1730340	The quad father.
1730340	1731340	Okay, I'll take the white one.
1731340	1732340	Okay.
1732340	1737000	Then I'll give the black one to Loki, because he's kind of dark too, so he's dark and gothic
1737000	1738000	and tragic and all that stuff.
1738000	1739000	Hey, I'm the resident goth.
1739000	1740000	Oh, this is cool.
1740000	1742480	And I have- Unplug and connect.
1742480	1746000	I have some mouse pads as well, so I'm going to give one to Renee as well, so there you
1746000	1747000	go.
1747000	1748000	Thank you.
1748000	1749000	And then you guys get mouse pads too.
1749000	1750000	That's what I wanted.
1750000	1751000	Oh.
1751000	1752000	The listeners.
1752000	1753000	Verizon wireless mouse pad.
1753000	1754000	That's funny, because I use singular.
1754000	1755000	But I thought that was very nice.
1755000	1756000	You do?
1756000	1759000	I thought that was very nice that our listeners kept us in mind there, so thank you.
1759000	1760000	Of course, thank you.
1760000	1764560	And I'm also going to give Renee, because we have a whole stock of these CDs, some CDs
1764560	1765560	from a different drum.
1765560	1766760	Ooh, I love a different drum.
1766760	1767760	I know, aren't they the best?
1767760	1768760	I know.
1768760	1772240	And we have some CDs here, and we've been giving these away just kind of sporadically.
1772240	1776680	We have a CD single for Come With Me from DDR Ultramix 3, a rain dancer, and a song that's
1776680	1781560	going to be in Ultramix 4, Rupesh Cartel, Yours to Command, is a B-side on this CD,
1781560	1782560	so enjoy.
1782560	1783560	Ooh, amazing.
1783560	1784560	Thank you.
1784560	1785560	I will.
1785560	1786560	No problemo.
1786560	1787560	Have fun with that.
1787560	1792000	Thank you so much for keeping, and to start us off, we are going to reenact the voicemails
1792000	1796680	of the week this week, and we have a very special message from our webmaster.
1796680	1797680	Let's take a listen.
1797680	1799680	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
1799680	1804200	This is Jason, and I have a very special and happy announcement from all of us.
1804200	1810560	Starting as of right now, you have a toll-free number that any of you are willing to use.
1810560	1814880	That number, first off, is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1814880	1819520	That is 1-877-4263657.
1819520	1823320	This is unfortunately only going to the United States and Canada, but the rest of you still
1823320	1826600	have Skype, and will work at any time.
1826600	1827600	Free for you.
1827600	1828600	Have fun.
1828600	1829600	All right.
1829600	1830600	Awesome.
1830600	1831600	So now we're almost like legitimate radio here.
1831600	1834840	We have our own 800 number, or 877 number, but same thing.
1834840	1838780	So we have a new toll-free number for you guys to use, and you can use that in interacting
1838780	1841800	with our station when we take calls a little later in the program.
1841800	1845660	That number, once again, 877-GAME-OLR.
1845660	1850200	That's 877-4263657.
1850200	1853300	Because of the fact that we have the toll-free number now, we're thinking this might encourage
1853300	1857280	folks to leave us voicemails, so we are going to open up that segment we did a while back.
1857280	1860280	We're going to reopen up that segment for the voicemails of the week.
1860280	1862480	I'll let you know the topic a little later on in the program.
1862480	1865560	We'll take your calls on the new 800 number a little bit later.
1865560	1869080	The old 916 number still works for those of you in the area, but I imagine most people
1869080	1871280	probably aren't going to want to use that.
1871280	1873980	Tonight marks the last week of our DDR previews.
1873980	1876820	New songs for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.
1876820	1880400	Too bad that today's last week, but we've been doing it for eight weeks, and we've got
1880400	1882100	some new songs for you guys tonight.
1882100	1883600	Very excited about that.
1883600	1886080	Orange Lounge Radio has a brand new YouTube channel.
1886080	1890400	If you listened to last week's episode, I believe I threatened to put something up.
1890400	1893000	Oh, the Loki drunk thing playing Mario Kart.
1893000	1894400	I threatened to put that up on YouTube.
1894400	1896200	I did, so check that out.
1896200	1899880	We are on YouTube under username Orange Lounge Radio, and some folks have already found the
1899880	1900880	videos and are subscribing to them.
1900880	1905680	I'm sure that was of excellent quality seeing as, you know, I think it was formatted for
1905680	1906680	the PSP.
1906680	1907880	It actually didn't come out that bad.
1907880	1909600	It actually came out pretty good.
1909600	1911040	I put some other stuff up there, too.
1911040	1915480	We have some news bits, like you remember the Oh, It's So Much Fun clip?
1915480	1919300	That's up there as well on YouTube, but one of them, there's a Guitar Hero story that
1919300	1923160	has Dark Soccer and Loki in it, and it came out squished for some reason.
1923160	1924160	The video is squished.
1924160	1928360	It's letterboxed, but not really, so I don't know what to do about that, but it's all there
1928360	1931120	if you folks want to check it out.
1931120	1932980	All right, let's get into some news.
1932980	1937720	Loki's going to start us off tonight, and he's going to cover some things that happened
1937720	1941560	because we pre-taped on Wednesday, and usually we do our show on Sunday, so he's going to
1941560	1945360	kind of do a bit of a gap story, so things we didn't get a chance to talk about last
1945360	1946360	week that we should have.
1946360	1950120	And pretty much the only thing that we missed talking about was the PlayStation Day in San
1950120	1955460	Francisco, and of course lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation 3, and a lot of
1955460	1959800	things being pulled out of the PlayStation 3, including the fact that they will not have
1959800	1962000	a gamer score system.
1962000	1966040	Originally they were going to be putting out that entitlement system that everyone had
1966040	1970200	a problem with because it kind of ripped off of the Xbox Live achievement system.
1970200	1974780	Well, that's not going to happen according to Jack Trenton from Sony.
1974780	1977160	There's no gamer score system at all.
1977160	1983360	They just kind of ran out of time and didn't feel like putting it in there, so very interesting
1983360	1984360	there.
1984360	1990680	And if you happen to be lucky enough to snag one of the first PlayStation 3s out there,
1990680	1997480	one of the first 500,000 of course, you may be getting a copy of Talladega Nights on Blu-ray,
1997480	2000880	because of course they really want to push that Blu-ray format with the Blu-ray drive
2000880	2005960	being in the actual console, so you get to enjoy that Will Ferrell comedy.
2005960	2010280	And it was actually pretty good, so definitely worth it, kind of like the Spider-Man 2 on
2010280	2011280	the PSP.
2011280	2017400	Anyways, some other stuff you'll be getting with your system of course, you probably want
2017400	2024080	to be getting some games, and their launch games have really kind of slimmed down a bit.
2024080	2031280	Sony's first party stuff, they've got Resistance, Fall of Man, NBA 07, and Genji Days of Blade.
2031280	2033480	Those will all be launch titles.
2033480	2038840	Now of course, Lair and Warhawk have been pushed to next year, so you won't see those
2038840	2040200	for a while.
2040200	2046080	Some other wonderful third party games though, of course the exclusive Full Auto 2 will be
2046080	2053960	coming out from Sega, Until Legends Dark Kingdom, Ridge Racer 7, and of course they will also
2053960	2060920	be getting versions of Fear, Fight Night Round 3, Elder Scrolls, Oblivion, Blazing Angels,
2060920	2064400	Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk's Project 8, and all the big stuff.
2064400	2070840	So it's an interesting launch window, I don't know.
2070840	2076360	Anywho, some stuff not Sony related.
2076360	2081000	Luminous Live, now there's been of course a lot of controversy over the whole buy half
2081000	2086720	of a game, purchase the rest of the game later on kind of format.
2086720	2092520	Well Mitsuguchi himself actually was interviewed by IGN, and one of the questions they asked
2092520	2099680	him was about that system, and of course he supports it, and basically saying Luminous
2099680	2104000	when it came out on the PSP was more expensive, and he feels that I guess you should pay the
2104000	2106360	same price on the 360.
2106360	2111100	Well thank you very much, I'll remember that when you release any other Q Entertainment
2111100	2116920	games like the wonderful 99 Nights, glad I rushed out to buy that one.
2116920	2121560	I actually did rush out to buy 99 Nights because I loved the demo and everything, and I got
2121560	2126040	mine for free, so glad I didn't spend money.
2126040	2133800	I will say though, I will not be buying Luminous Plus or Luminous 2, or any of your Extend
2133800	2139360	Extra, every Extend Extra, screw you, I'm not buying that crap either.
2139360	2141760	And I will buy them all because I'm a whore.
2141760	2144240	Actually I probably won't get the PS2 one, that is a little bit of overkill, but I do
2144240	2148200	want Luminous 2 and I do want every Extend Extra, so what can I say.
2148200	2149200	Sorry.
2149200	2152000	Whatever.
2152000	2155800	So that pretty much does it for the big stories that we missed in that little bit of a gap,
2155800	2159480	I want to do some comments from chat real fast because the chat room is just lit up
2159480	2160640	on some of this stuff.
2160640	2165200	Jeremy Todd 1 says they ran out of time, it's kind of interesting to know that the 360 came
2165200	2169440	out a year earlier than PlayStation 3 and yet it has achievements, and so the PlayStation
2169440	2173520	3 had an extra year to get it, but they couldn't even get this simple feature?
2173520	2176520	I don't know, lack of achievements, is that going to kill the PS3?
2176520	2177920	I don't think it's a big deal.
2177920	2183160	I don't think that's really a big deal, but I think what's really interesting is some
2183160	2188800	of the launch games not having online support, that is a big deal right there I think.
2188800	2194440	This just adds one of those little mouth protectors in Kudaragi's helmet.
2194440	2199720	You're an achievement point, Torloki, does this lower your opinion of Sony or do you
2199720	2200720	really care?
2200720	2201720	Not really.
2201720	2204600	If anything, Microsoft has this wonderful achievement system to get me to buy games
2204600	2211060	I normally probably wouldn't buy or to rent games, it kind of drives the market a little
2211060	2220880	bit to get you to play more games, so I guess it would, to be honest, it's not a real deal
2220880	2226220	breaker for me, but I think the lack of online and certain games for them is a deal breaker
2226220	2227220	for me.
2227220	2232320	And the other thing is they haven't really still haven't said what their online service
2232320	2236920	has, and they're saying it's free, but I don't see multiplayer gaming as...
2236920	2238400	They showed a friends list.
2238400	2242640	Okay, friends list is free, you get that free with Xbox Live, but they still have not come
2242640	2246000	out and said multiplayer gaming is free.
2246000	2250960	They have not said that yet, so I'm thinking it's probably not free.
2250960	2254920	Shadow Charlie in our chat room says, what about backwards memory card support for PlayStation
2254920	2255920	3?
2255920	2256920	You've got to buy something for that, though.
2256920	2257920	Yeah, there's a little adapter.
2257920	2262280	You can do that with the 360, but you've got to buy something, so mind if I ask you that?
2262280	2267160	Well, you know what, at least they're putting out the actual device to do it instead of
2267160	2268160	some third party.
2268160	2275320	I mean, props to them for that, but I don't know, they're pretty much coming out with
2275320	2277000	equivalents for everything.
2277000	2280960	Fireboma in our chat says, I thought it wasn't a Sony launch until Ridge Racer game was launched
2280960	2281960	with it.
2281960	2284200	That's true, it's got to be a Ridge Racer.
2284200	2286680	Ridge Racer, I had to, at least one more time.
2286680	2290080	I think this is interesting.
2290080	2295400	Kendro lends an interesting perspective here on the Luminous microtransactions debate.
2295400	2299640	If microtransactions total the price of a normal game, then that's kind of cool, and
2299640	2303960	as somebody had calculated above, if you buy Luminous and all the microtransactions, it's
2303960	2305040	going to be about $35.
2305040	2307400	Well, let me put it this way.
2307400	2312880	It's either they release it on live and you have the option to buy these microtransactions,
2312880	2319000	or they just port it and throw it out on a CD or DVD and just put it in there and you
2319000	2323160	get it all anyways, and it's all the same game, kind of like Luminous Plus.
2323160	2327080	What I didn't like about the whole thing is I felt they weren't very upfront about telling
2327080	2328720	us what the game was not going to have.
2328720	2332900	I was very disappointed to find VS Computer wasn't there, because that's kind of a way
2332900	2337240	you could unlock skins in the original PSP version, so I kind of went there to try and
2337240	2339360	unlock more skins, and you kind of couldn't do it.
2339360	2342400	So that was a little bit disappointing, and I didn't realize that feature was going to
2342400	2345360	be gone, or well, have one stage only.
2345360	2350120	I can understand downloading more skins, but I don't like downloading new features.
2350120	2353320	I shouldn't have to buy two-player.
2353320	2356440	You know what, Blaze says they could have packaged Luminous as a real game and no one
2356440	2362980	would be bitching, and you know what, I don't know, it would have been a little less deceptive
2362980	2363980	in my mind.
2363980	2366640	I don't know, there's a certain element of deception with this whole thing.
2366640	2368480	Maybe I'm being overreactive, I don't know.
2368480	2373120	Well, also one thing to consider being in the video game industry is the production
2373120	2379040	costs, you know, they would have to not only go through rigorous testing to ensure that
2379040	2386360	all of the content in the game follows Microsoft's strict rules, but also how much it would cost
2386360	2393800	to send and make the CDs and the manuals and things like that, otherwise you could just
2393800	2394800	buy it online.
2394800	2397980	True, but don't the online games go through a similar process?
2397980	2402120	Maybe it's not as rigid, but the way, because remember when we had that story a couple weeks
2402120	2405920	back about how Duke Nukem wasn't going to be on Xbox Live anytime soon because it would
2405920	2410200	have to go through a process, and Microsoft supposedly has all these games in a queue
2410200	2415720	waiting to go on the arcade, so maybe there is still a process, but maybe it's less stringent
2415720	2420120	than having to put the manual, do the clamshells, all that stuff.
2420120	2425400	So it would definitely cost less to go straight to Live.
2425400	2430300	I think the reason why they did it on Live to begin with was so they could, it started
2430300	2434560	off as a microtransactions thing, it was like, oh we could sell the Madonna skin and we could
2434560	2438120	sell whatever other artist skins we're going to have, and then it just turned into, hey
2438120	2440500	let's microtransaction for everything!
2440500	2443240	But there's some interesting perspectives, I know we got an email on this too, so I'll
2443240	2447000	save that for the mailbag that lends an interesting perspective as well.
2447000	2451360	Well I'm sure we've got more stories about it too, I know there's other stuff this week,
2451360	2455560	but I haven't looked at the show rules, so good job prepping for tonight.
2455560	2460060	For example, the whole Madden training videos thing where they want you to buy that stuff,
2460060	2467080	I think people are starting to see, oh microtransactions are working, then everyone's jumping on bandwagon,
2467080	2469880	but no one's getting it right.
2469880	2475720	It's kind of like one of those things, like back when motion sensing, ooh motion sensing
2475720	2482980	is cool, let's all release motion sensing stuff now, and not everyone has it, or stuff
2482980	2484960	for the DS.
2484960	2489240	Touchscreen is awesome, let's make more games supporting touchscreen, like some games had
2489240	2494440	the touchscreen with pause, just retarded stuff like that, so some people don't get
2494440	2495440	it.
2495440	2499080	We've got to keep it moving here, we're like 40 minutes into the show and two stories in,
2499080	2504260	so I want to mention this story, this was another one from last week, but this was so
2504260	2510040	huge that it's still being blogged about this week, and this is a feature in the video game
2510040	2517720	Bully, that gaygamer.net and another site, I believe it was Game Brink, captured videos
2517720	2523560	of hot boy-on-boy action, basically, that the main character in the game, Jimmy Hopkins,
2523560	2526000	can kiss boys as well as girls in the game.
2526000	2527000	Hey boy.
2527000	2531200	Actually, I believe there were certain ones.
2531200	2534240	You have to inspect them first and you'll have an action option for kiss.
2534240	2537700	There's about 10% of the characters you can do that to.
2537700	2544340	And they have the same animation as the females.
2544340	2550040	It's causing this big controversy, I don't know, I sit back at this and I go, and keep
2550040	2553520	in mind I'm gay myself, and I'm looking at this going, this is a way bigger deal than
2553520	2554520	it ought to be.
2554520	2560800	I'm just sitting here going, when it was in the Sims, it was like, okay, hey, you can
2560800	2564080	just do this if you want or do this if you want, but now it seems to be like, I don't
2564080	2567800	know, with all these sites reporting on it and all this stuff, you guys are making a
2567800	2572880	big deal out of what shouldn't, it's just, hey, if you want to play the game like this,
2572880	2577720	if you want to try this, like Fable, yeah, and Fable, you kind of did that too.
2577720	2581320	I don't know why this is such a, it's dumb, and you know why?
2581320	2585120	Because people are looking, they are, I swear to God, people are just making Rockstar fucking
2585120	2586700	scapegoat for everything.
2586700	2590640	They are scrutinizing these games to find something wrong so they can go and sue them
2590640	2591640	some more.
2591640	2592640	You know what?
2592640	2598680	Before you go and start doing that, be warned that they did put this content, they brought
2598680	2602080	it to the attention of the ERSRB when they were giving it a team rating.
2602080	2603800	So you know what?
2603800	2609280	Fuck off, because this is all kosher, you know, people approved this for the team rating,
2609280	2610760	and that's it, that's the game, play it.
2610760	2614840	You know, at least, hey, at least he's not fucking bashing skulls in or, you know, eating
2614840	2620000	brains or something like that, just, it's just fucking kissing, that's all it is.
2620000	2621000	You know what?
2621000	2626300	By curious people, there are tons of them in college and stuff, who gives a shit about
2626300	2632720	just, you know, a fictional character who's not even real kissing a fictional character
2632720	2636760	who's not even real who happens to be disguised as a male person.
2636760	2642320	I mean, these are, it's like saying, oh, you know, two puppets making out, oh, but they're
2642320	2646540	male puppets, you know, so that's really wrong.
2646540	2652440	And nobody really cried out about the whole, you know, blowjob scene in Team America that
2652440	2656680	I noticed, because they were puppets.
2656680	2661960	Well, I don't know, I mean, I understand, you know, why, you know, especially, you know,
2661960	2666840	gay gaming sites would be a little bit, you know, yay about this, because they, you don't
2666840	2668720	get this option in a lot of games.
2668720	2672480	You don't, you don't really, you know, so it's kind of nice to see sandbox games going
2672480	2676160	towards that, hey, you know, if we're going to interact a romance element into this and
2676160	2679840	we truly want to be, you know, open, hey, we're going to, you know, so I applaud that
2679840	2683700	Rockstar did this, but I can't help but take, you know, so I'm not saying it's a bad thing
2683700	2684700	at all.
2684700	2685700	I think it's great.
2685700	2686700	I think it's awesome.
2686700	2691640	I think, you know, I'm very glad to see that, you know, that's kind of being put into games,
2691640	2696240	you know, and the true sandbox idea of do whatever you want, literally.
2696240	2699600	If they were going to be really, though, accurate about it, though, they should have had some
2699600	2707080	girls just, you know, be, I'm not interested in you, I'm interested in her.
2707080	2709240	Nobody would have blinked an eye.
2709240	2710240	That's the other weird thing.
2710240	2711240	Nobody would have blinked an eye at that.
2711240	2716760	Because the vast majority, I hate to say the vast majority of gamers out there are, well,
2716760	2720200	desperate young men who like to see hot lesbian action.
2720200	2723680	They should just do a game called hot lesbian action.
2723680	2725040	It would sell.
2725040	2726880	It's called Dead or Alive Extreme.
2726880	2729200	Yeah, with independently moving boobs.
2729200	2734720	Where you sit on the other pair's back and do, sorry.
2734720	2735720	Never mind.
2735720	2736720	What were you going to say?
2736720	2742920	I was going to say Vice City Stories actually has, one of the main characters is a transsexual.
2742920	2746640	You don't know who it is, but one of them is, you know, we learn later on, one of them
2746640	2750040	is a tranny and they have a major role in the game.
2750040	2755360	So it's like Rockstar's trying to, I don't know, push the boundaries of it.
2755360	2759840	I don't know, it's just, they're just, you know, writing diverse characters into their
2759840	2760840	games.
2760840	2761840	Exactly.
2761840	2762840	You know?
2762840	2763840	What's wrong with that?
2763840	2764840	It's about time.
2764840	2768120	You know, these kind of aren't the games that really interest me.
2768120	2769120	Here's the thing.
2769120	2772520	I'm not going to go buy Bully just because it has this in it and I know other people
2772520	2780120	who did and I'm kind of like, you know it's a game and this is like five seconds of a
2780120	2781120	game.
2781120	2782120	I don't know.
2782120	2783120	I don't understand why you would go.
2783120	2788480	I mean, maybe they're trying to support the cause or whatever, which, okay, whatever.
2788480	2789480	But you know what though?
2789480	2794520	I'd go see a movie that had Christina Ricci naked or something like that.
2794520	2797400	Maybe five seconds of the movie, but I'd go see because of that.
2797400	2798400	All right.
2798400	2799400	Point made.
2799400	2803760	Well, speaking of things that have absolutely nothing to do with sexuality, unless you just
2803760	2811160	happen to swing toward Master Chief that way, there is still plans by Microsoft to do the
2811160	2816600	Halo movie, however, the film studios decided not to.
2816600	2818240	So Microsoft has issued a statement.
2818240	2822200	We were disappointed that Universal wanted to significantly renegotiate the financial
2822200	2826360	points of the deal, but the Halo franchise is hugely popular and our goal remains the
2826360	2830520	same, to find a partner that shares our passion and will creatively collaborate with us to
2830520	2833300	best represent the story.
2833300	2836760	So it may happen, but not anytime soon.
2836760	2840560	Yeah, I think this just means delays, development hell.
2840560	2841560	Yeah, seriously.
2841560	2842560	Oh, well.
2842560	2843560	You know what?
2843560	2848000	If it takes that much time to get it right, I would much rather see them delay it and
2848000	2849000	get it right.
2849000	2854720	I mean, Halo is a game, so I think the games are what a lot of us are more excited about
2854720	2855780	than the movie.
2855780	2857240	So Hollywood, take your time.
2857240	2858840	Just don't fuck it up.
2858840	2860120	Exactly.
2860120	2864540	Some interesting stuff, those rumored from Game Informer is they're saying that they
2864540	2871880	have an insider that's let them know that Halo 3 is going to be getting a demo early
2871880	2878340	next year, and that's pretty much all we know right now is speculation.
2878340	2884520	There might be a Halo 3 demo early next year, and that would make sense considering the
2884520	2893280	supposed release date of Halo 3 being March or April of next year, so yeah, but duh.
2893280	2897040	But one of the interesting rumors I also read about Halo 3 demos, they were saying they
2897040	2899540	might charge for it.
2899540	2900540	That was a weird rumor.
2900540	2902260	I read that too.
2902260	2903260	I don't know.
2903260	2909560	The only way I could see that being, well I guess they kind of already do that.
2909560	2916160	You can go to Best Buy I think and buy a World of Warcraft 14 day trial for a couple bucks.
2916160	2919280	So I guess charging for demos isn't absolutely unheard of.
2919280	2924640	I think it does make a lot of people go eh, but if people will pay it, they're going to
2924640	2925640	get away with it.
2925640	2928920	Especially if it's multiplayer and online demo, there's going to be a lot of people
2928920	2931140	that are down for that.
2931140	2936800	They probably do have room to get away with charging for that, so I guess we'll see.
2936800	2937800	What do you think?
2937800	2938800	Would you pay for a Halo 3 demo?
2938800	2939800	Eh, probably.
2939800	2940800	Depends on how much it is.
2940800	2941800	It would be nice.
2941800	2946960	If it's like five bucks, I'm not paying for that, but you know, and also I'm not really
2946960	2951200	a good indicator of whether you'd pay for it or not because I would probably buy it
2951200	2955120	just to report on it for the show, so you know.
2955120	2957880	With the gamer in you, the regular gamer, nonjournalist in you?
2957880	2958880	No.
2958880	2959880	Okay.
2959880	2960880	I wouldn't pay for it because, you know what I mean?
2960880	2961880	I never played Halo.
2961880	2965560	What if it, now here's a good idea that might justify that, what if it came with those little
2965560	2969720	pictures or themes or something, came with it, like to maybe sweeten the deal?
2969720	2970720	No.
2970720	2971720	No?
2971720	2972720	No, I wouldn't do that.
2972720	2976960	Here's what I would do is I would, I subscribe to Xbox Magazine and let me get this straight.
2976960	2983080	Xbox Magazine, they used to come with demos that you couldn't find on Xbox Live Marketplace
2983080	2985880	and they used to get them like way early and stuff.
2985880	2986980	That's not the case anymore.
2986980	2992120	Their demos are almost useless now since you can get everything on Xbox Live Marketplace.
2992120	2996280	I think there's only one demo that I've seen that has not hit the Marketplace and
2996280	3001380	that would be Timeshift because that was before when it was being put out by Atari instead
3001380	3003120	of Nvidia.
3003120	3009000	So, you know, if they put it out, that's what I would say they should do is put it
3009000	3011500	in the magazine.
3011500	3014840	Interesting comments from our chat room, Bandit says they should not charge for the demo but
3014840	3017880	should charge for the opportunity to play multiplayer in the demo.
3017880	3021880	Well, you know, because servers cost money to maintain, I guess, although no other multiplayer
3021880	3023920	demos have been charged as of yet.
3023920	3028680	Let's see, ShadowNextGen makes it very clear, I'm not paying for a demo.
3028680	3030440	I ain't doing it.
3030440	3035120	Let's see, VidPower says Halo 3 will be microtransactions.
3035120	3037000	Spend 400 points to get the sniper rifle.
3037000	3038660	Oh, I hope not.
3038660	3039660	I hope not.
3039660	3040660	I don't think so.
3040660	3042480	Because it's going to give people money.
3042480	3043480	Maps maybe.
3043480	3044840	I would see maps.
3044840	3047360	I think the way they did it in Halo 1 was great.
3047360	3050820	You know, if you are an addict and you have to have these maps right now, great.
3050820	3053240	Pay for them and then in three months they'll be free.
3053240	3054240	You know?
3054240	3055240	I don't know.
3055240	3058040	But I think it would throw off the balance of the game to have some people get the sniper
3058040	3062660	rifles but some people don't, you know, and we're arbitrarily picking a weapon here.
3062660	3066760	We don't mean that that's actually going to happen but I just hope they use caution in
3066760	3068320	the microtransactions.
3068320	3071240	Maybe learning a little bit from this luminous backlash that's going on.
3071240	3072880	What about EA?
3072880	3074640	Jeremy Todd 1 is a very interesting point.
3074640	3080200	People who don't have their 360 connected to live will find the OXM's demo very useful.
3080200	3083880	Some people that play Halo don't play it on live because it does have a very thorough
3083880	3084960	story mode in it.
3084960	3088000	So something to think about.
3088000	3092800	Alright, anyway, one other story about the 360.
3092800	3096220	It's possible that there's going to be a dashboard update this week.
3096220	3100440	Now this is speculation but the speculation is coming from something Major Nelson said
3100440	3102520	in his latest podcast.
3102520	3106320	He was talking to a developer on the show and basically they were talking about the
3106320	3109060	wireless communicator that's coming out very soon.
3109060	3112040	The wireless communicator is scheduled to come out October 31st.
3112040	3115760	Major Nelson said, you know, if you were to go to the store today and buy it, you can't
3115760	3118520	use it until the fall upgrade to the dashboard.
3118520	3121860	Well then that gets people to think, okay, so he's saying that if, because this came
3121860	3126220	out last week, this podcast, if you have this communicator early, it's not going to do you
3126220	3127220	any good.
3127220	3129720	So no worries trying to go find a leaked one.
3129720	3135280	But if the actual date for this is the 31st and it's not going to work until the dashboard
3135280	3139120	update goes into effect, doesn't that mean that the dashboard update needs to happen
3139120	3141240	on the 31st or they're going to have some angry customers?
3141240	3144120	They would need to put it up beforehand.
3144120	3147660	And I think it's about the time to do that anyways because you're going to want to have
3147660	3152880	the dashboard update ready for the 7th when the HD DVD player comes out.
3152880	3157280	You're going to want to have, you know, the update ready for when the PlayStation 3 comes
3157280	3161000	out, so you have that 1080p and you can compete with them.
3161000	3164640	And whatever other fun stuff they want to throw in there, more backwards compatibility
3164640	3165640	maybe.
3165640	3169820	You know, hey, maybe it'd be nice if they had some Ultimate Mortal Combat, or Mortal
3169820	3174160	Combat Annihilation, you know, backwards compatibility on there, I'd like to play with that, but
3174160	3175160	you know.
3175160	3176840	We'll see what happens.
3176840	3180520	If anything, if it's not this week, it's very soon.
3180520	3184080	Do you think that they've been quiet about the dashboard update because they don't want
3184080	3187120	people going, when's it coming out, Major Nelson, when's it coming out, Major Nelson,
3187120	3188120	when's it coming out?
3188120	3193280	Well, I'm sure he's trying to be quiet about anything, yeah, just because his fanbase is
3193280	3194280	a little...
3194280	3195280	...needy.
3195280	3196280	...bitchy.
3196280	3197280	...needy.
3197280	3198280	Are you there?
3198280	3199280	Are you there?
3199280	3200280	Are you there?
3200280	3201280	Are you there?
3201280	3202280	Yeah.
3202280	3203280	Major Nelson seems like a really great guy.
3203280	3204280	I've never met him in person.
3204280	3205280	He seems really cool.
3205280	3209720	I will turn this dashboard update around if you do not behave.
3209720	3214080	But if you read those comments on his board, and you know it's getting to him because,
3214080	3217400	you know, he's sad to make some changes, yeah, I'd be so annoyed too.
3217400	3218720	All right, anyway.
3218720	3223840	Well, something that may annoy other people in regards to Microsoft is that there's actually
3223840	3231120	indications that they favor the live gold account above the platinum ones.
3231120	3232120	Well, they should...
3232120	3233120	Over the silver?
3233120	3234120	I'm sorry, over the silver.
3234120	3235120	They should.
3235120	3236120	I'm paying for it.
3236120	3244520	Well, basically they're saying that, especially for some of the demos that are coming out,
3244520	3249760	they're releasing them to the gold accounts before they're releasing them to the silver.
3249760	3256480	So you'll get the newer trailers, the newer demos, instead of, you know, having to wait
3256480	3259200	for them because they're releasing them about a week or so afterwards.
3259200	3260200	That's fine.
3260200	3267400	That's perfect because it's more incentive to go play on gold, and you know what, hey,
3267400	3268400	it's free.
3268400	3270600	You can't complain if you're getting demos later on.
3270600	3271600	Just whatever.
3271600	3272600	Pay for it.
3272600	3276080	So if you're paying 50 bucks for your year subscription, you should be getting your stuff.
3276080	3277080	Exactly.
3277080	3281040	You should have some sort of perks, and I'm surprised there hasn't really been much more
3281040	3282040	other than this.
3282040	3283040	I mean, so...
3283040	3286800	If not, then if you've got the silver, if you want them at the same time, they should
3286800	3295000	do some sort of pay-by-download for those, if you want to get them ahead of time, but
3295000	3296000	other than that...
3296000	3298920	50 dollars a year is really not that expensive.
3298920	3302080	And they do giveaways and specials all the time.
3302080	3305560	It's expensive next to free, which is what PlayStation 3 is promising, although I know
3305560	3309640	they haven't said anything about, I just, you know, I just have a feeling it's going
3309640	3310640	to be free.
3310640	3313240	I think they've kind of insinuated it, you know what I mean?
3313240	3315400	But I don't think they're going to come out of nowhere and say, surprise, you're going
3315400	3316400	to have to pay for this.
3316400	3317560	I'm going to piss more people off with that.
3317560	3320840	I think Sony is in a corner now where they have to make it free.
3320840	3325640	Didn't they have that comparison chart that got them in a lot of trouble, that was comparing
3325640	3331020	the Sony PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360, and it was talking about like, hey, this comes
3331020	3335320	with it, and on Xbox, it was basically trying to show the Xbox 360 actually costs more than
3335320	3338880	the PlayStation 3, like it was that comparison, and one of the things was they talked about
3338880	3343240	Play Online, and it was free on PlayStation 3, so I'm pretty sure it's going to be...
3343240	3345720	Well, 50 a month, though, it's not that expensive.
3345720	3353760	You're technically paying about, I think, $4.17 a month, if you consider, which is less
3353760	3362400	than the cost of lunch, so if you think about it in the big picture, you really are not
3362400	3365200	paying all that much for your subscription cost for Live.
3365200	3366440	Couple quick comments in chat.
3366440	3369800	Blaze says, good, if I'm paying $50 a year, I should get it earlier.
3369800	3373960	JeremyTau1 says, I'd rather pay $50 a year for Live, which has a lot more neat features
3373960	3378600	than have the free PS3 Online service, and it having not as many features, so interesting
3378600	3379600	point there as well.
3379600	3380600	Pay for what you get.
3380600	3381600	All right.
3381600	3385320	ShadowNextGen agrees, $50 a year for Xbox Live is a great value.
3385320	3388000	All right.
3388000	3389000	Interesting.
3389000	3390000	I don't know.
3390000	3395080	I mean, I'm glad that they have some perks for the gold people.
3395080	3401280	Anywho, some other fun stuff that's come out about Halo 3 this week, mainly leaked from
3401280	3407360	a Swedish magazine called Level, they've had some actual screenshots and stuff, and of
3407360	3412400	course, brand new info about the game, including some new weapons like Spiker, which is a new
3412400	3417720	brute weapon, a Spartan laser that apparently tears vehicles apart, and a nail grenade,
3417720	3420440	which sticks in the walls and sends nails everywhere.
3420440	3425400	Brand new vehicles like the Mongoose, which is like a miniature ATV for two passengers
3425400	3430680	with no weapons on it, and then the one that people are hoping is mistranslated, but the
3430680	3437320	Man Cannon, which launches players into the air, kind of like jump pads in Unreal or Quake
3437320	3439080	Arena.
3439080	3440080	Come step in, sir.
3440080	3443000	You want to see my Man Cannon?
3443000	3444520	Some interesting stuff.
3444520	3447560	They're going to be having the left and right trigger weapons.
3447560	3454320	You'll be able to reload them separately using the left and right shoulder buttons, and apparently
3454320	3459440	the X button has some sort of secret functionality to it that they haven't mentioned yet.
3459440	3461440	Man Cannon.
3461440	3463400	It's not the Man Cannon.
3463400	3467440	Some other interesting stuff is it's going to be coming out in three different SKUs.
3467440	3471240	The first one is game only, the second one will be a collector's edition, and the third
3471240	3479100	one is the legendary edition, which includes a replica of Master Chief's helmet, which
3479100	3485040	is miniaturized, it's about cat size, so you can put it on your cat, or your Man Cannon.
3485040	3489480	It's also going to include documentaries, developer commentary, spinoff material like
3489480	3495400	Red vs. Blue, Spark of Life, etc., and all the cut scenes from Halo 1.53 and HD on a
3495400	3496400	separate disc.
3496400	3497400	That's kind of cool.
3497400	3500480	And maybe a sneak peek at the Halo movie, they're just speculating right now.
3500480	3504680	But lots of screenshots, looks very pretty, very, very pretty.
3504680	3510480	Of course, also coming out at the same time, not to be outdone by this leaked information,
3510480	3517920	one up had to mention that EGM will be also having some content on Halo 3, which by the
3517920	3526180	looks of their content, almost identical to what is in that Swedish magazine, and yeah,
3526180	3529880	so they'll be coming, in fact they're going to be doing three weeks of coverage for Halo
3529880	3531880	3.
3531880	3536640	I thought usually you did that leading up to a game's release.
3536640	3541280	This is just randomly, hey folks, three weeks of Halo 3 stuff.
3541280	3546060	Okay, well, okay, that's what you want to do.
3546060	3550960	That whole Man Cannon thing reminds me of when we were playing F.E.A.R. last night,
3550960	3560400	and there's a weapon in there called the Penetrator, so if that gives you any indication, so anyway.
3560400	3564360	Let's see, PooEater says, okay, so I'm guessing Man Cannon will be the next joke we run into
3564360	3567480	the ground, most likely, most likely.
3567480	3572120	DJ Morpheus asks, hello, by the way, to our good buddy DJ Morpheus, honestly, who really
3572120	3574800	looks at the developer extras?
3574800	3576880	That's kind of a good question.
3576880	3578440	It depends on the game.
3578440	3583400	I wouldn't buy this Halo 3 Uber edition or whatever, that's too much crap, but I know
3583400	3585360	people who love their Halo.
3585360	3589040	I might do that just to put a Halo helmet in my cube.
3589040	3592400	I don't really have a lot of game memorabilia, and that might be kind of fun.
3592400	3595120	I have to see what it looks like, if it looks retarded, I'm not buying it.
3595120	3600480	Well, no, I actually love seeing all of the behind the scenes stuff, being in a design
3600480	3606520	major myself, I love seeing all the artistic elements that go behind it, but when we got
3606520	3610640	the Toy Story box set, I was watching all the rendering errors first, before I was even
3610640	3613960	watching the movies, because I'm just into all that kind of stuff.
3613960	3614960	I think it's great.
3614960	3618880	I like the ones in Shrek, though, where the donkey turns into a big fuzzy porcupine looking
3618880	3619880	thing.
3619880	3624320	Well, I personally wouldn't mind buying the extra stuff.
3624320	3629680	For Company of Heroes, which is an RTS game for the PC, they had just the regular edition
3629680	3633680	and they had the special silver edition, and with the special silver edition, they had
3633680	3640720	a DVD with special features of how they made the storyline, the people they interviewed,
3640720	3644800	and it even came with little flashcards, so that you can see what type of tanks you were
3644800	3652000	fighting and what were some of their names and some of the weak spots and everything,
3652000	3657160	so it was pretty interesting for those people who love World War II.
3657160	3661400	I'm getting the collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII, so I can watch all the extras
3661400	3669640	that are going to be there, and yes, I probably will watch them, because I'm sad.
3669640	3673160	This is another game I believe has a collector's edition, yes, Gears of War has a collector's
3673160	3674160	edition coming out.
3674160	3676920	Well, Gears of War has gone gold-ish.
3676920	3680200	It has gone officially gold, too, it's gold.
3680200	3686360	Cliffy B says, my job as designer of Gears of War is well more or less done, and that
3686360	3689800	was coming from his official blog, so it does look like Gears of War is going to make it
3689800	3690800	out there on time.
3690800	3696520	Then it was actually, I think, later on that week also, it was also officially gold.
3696520	3700880	I believe Major Nelson kind of dropped that bomb a little later, I think, from what I'm
3700880	3701880	reading.
3701880	3702880	Yeah, they're all ready to go.
3702880	3705880	So, the game will be out on time, doesn't look like any delays are going to happen unless
3705880	3710980	something really screws up, but that's exciting, because for the Halo 3, folks, this is a real
3710980	3712460	hold-em-over game.
3712460	3714560	Even for non-Halo people, maybe this is something.
3714560	3715560	It's really cool-looking.
3715560	3722180	Yeah, I hope there's a demo on Marketplace, so I can check it out, because it looked really
3722180	3725380	cool at E3, but watching and playing are two very, very different things.
3725380	3727920	I'm buying it.
3727920	3729440	Maybe I'll borrow yours, then, and check it out first.
3729440	3734480	I do think I want it, though, after Final Fantasy XII is beaten.
3734480	3736440	I'm not getting Final Fantasy XII, though.
3736440	3737520	Look, I'm going to say this.
3737520	3739040	I've been a very, very good boy.
3739040	3745680	There is a pirated copy of Final Fantasy XII sitting on the floor of my living room right
3745680	3747200	now, and I haven't touched it.
3747200	3750880	I'm being good, and I'm being a very good boy.
3750880	3754720	Well it's kind of on someone else's PlayStation's hard drive, so I can't really give that away.
3754720	3762800	I'm not going to name names, but he's sitting in this room, and it's not me.
3762800	3764240	I'm not touching it.
3764240	3769200	I'm going to wait and buy a legitimate copy of the game when it comes out, because I want
3769200	3774200	to do the sappy, like, oh, I'm going to play it on launch day like everyone, and I got
3774200	3778360	the call today that says they're just going to do the midnight launch party at GameStop,
3778360	3779760	so I'm tempted to take a camera.
3779760	3781280	Does somebody want to go with me late tomorrow?
3781280	3783220	I'll go with you if you want to get me a copy.
3783220	3784220	Take a video camera?
3784220	3785220	Tomorrow.
3785220	3788840	I'm not going to buy you that game after you bashed on it on this program, so you hate
3788840	3789840	the battle system.
3789840	3790840	You can kiss my butt.
3790840	3793440	Actually, actually, actually, actually, there are things about that game that make me want
3793440	3795120	it, but I'm still so busy.
3795120	3801440	I really am getting into PSU now, but you let me make a game on my memory card, so I
3801440	3802440	play over here.
3802440	3805240	GameStops have had Final Fantasy XII since, like, Friday, by the way.
3805240	3808680	Yeah, so did CompUSA, but they put them all out on the shelves, from what I hear, but
3808680	3811080	I'm being good, and I'm waiting.
3811080	3814400	Did somebody want to come, like, we could take a video camera, do something for YouTube.
3814400	3815400	I'll go with you.
3815400	3816400	I don't know.
3816400	3817400	I've got to work on Tuesday.
3817400	3818400	Yeah, we'll see.
3818400	3821560	I do, too, but hey, staying up late might be fun.
3821560	3826200	Well, speaking of things, though, that are kind of messed up, you know, they broke a
3826200	3830040	particular Walmart in Arkansas, broke street date for Guitar Hero 2.
3830040	3835800	It was actually reported on, so since it's actually supposed to be released on November
3835800	3842080	7th, and Walmart said, uh-uh, we're releasing it now, then maybe your local Walmart will
3842080	3843080	have it.
3843080	3847240	I'm actually sort of thinking about making a run by Walmart, just because I have to play
3847240	3848240	Trogdor.
3848240	3854160	If you know, this is kind of a, well, it's a related story.
3854160	3862600	You know you can actually hack the demo to play the songs that were unlocked in the game.
3862600	3864600	Apparently they were on the demo disc.
3864600	3866080	Way to go, programmers!
3866080	3867080	You rock!
3867080	3868840	Keeping that content on discs.
3868840	3870680	This is how hot coffee happens.
3870680	3873920	Anyways, so yeah, apparently you can hack the demo.
3873920	3874920	They have some programming.
3874920	3875920	I've got the demo at my house.
3875920	3876920	Yeah.
3876920	3878920	I have to see what's what.
3878920	3880360	They have Trogdor on there.
3880360	3883600	I don't get it, because I will just keep going back to playing YYZ over and over and over
3883600	3884600	again.
3884600	3889720	I was even watching this live performance of Rush doing that on YouTube, with the longest
3889720	3891480	drum solo ever.
3891480	3896400	I am actually passing on Guitar Hero 2 until the 360 version.
3896400	3898440	I sold my Guitar Hero today.
3898440	3899440	Wow.
3899440	3902760	I'm going to probably get both.
3902760	3911700	As much as I really enjoy Red Octane and so forth, I actually really like Guitar Freaks,
3911700	3913440	and that's where my allegiance goes to.
3913440	3915640	It goes to Konami, I'm sorry.
3915640	3916640	Oh, interesting.
3916640	3919520	Actually, I would say you're a little bit in the minority there.
3919520	3923760	A lot of people don't really prefer Guitar Freaks.
3923760	3926320	I think it just depends on your taste in music, too.
3926320	3930120	Would you say you like to listen to that Japanese rock and the stuff that's usually in those
3930120	3931120	games?
3931120	3932120	Oh, definitely.
3932120	3934560	That's probably why you prefer Guitar Freaks in the end.
3934560	3935560	It really is about the music.
3935560	3936560	Yeah.
3936560	3939780	I would not have been as excited about Guitar Hero 2 if it wasn't that they put bass mode
3939780	3942080	in it, which I always do on Guitar Freaks.
3942080	3944080	Same here.
3944080	3947320	The good thing, though, that I actually will still prefer Guitar Freaks over Guitar Hero
3947320	3951480	4 is because I've got Dramania and I've got a controller, so it's all about putting it
3951480	3956640	in session mode and just going at it when you've got a group of people.
3956640	3960240	Too bad Keyboard Mania wouldn't link, but that's still...
3960240	3961600	It's not that I dislike Guitar Hero.
3961600	3964680	I really do want to play Guitar Hero 2, but now it's just such a bad time.
3964680	3966000	I really hate Christmas.
3966000	3970080	I love it and I hate it, because they just avalanche the games on us at this period.
3970080	3971680	And to some people, it's Yule.
3971680	3972680	Well, whatever.
3972680	3973680	You know what I mean.
3973680	3976800	Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate.
3976800	3981520	It's just this avalanche of games right now and I can't play them all, so I might as well
3981520	3985480	just wait for the 360 version, which will have better graphics, widescreen, and maybe
3985480	3987160	some extra songs.
3987160	3988160	Who knows?
3988160	3989160	We'll wait and see.
3989160	3990160	And I'll play it then.
3990160	3992680	You can come play at my house.
3992680	3995200	Just like I played pinball this week, I forgot to say it in my gaming week, I finally got
3995200	3996200	to play one at the table.
3996200	3997200	I played Guns N' Roses.
3997200	3998200	That's right.
3998200	3999200	My, my, my, my, my, Michelle.
3999200	4000200	All right.
4000200	4003600	It was when he goes, I hate you, Michelle!
4003600	4004600	That was funny, bro.
4004600	4005600	I don't hate Christmas.
4005600	4007080	I don't hate chatter saying I hate Christmas.
4007080	4008600	I don't hate Christmas.
4008600	4010640	I hate you for saying I hate Christmas.
4010640	4016200	Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, the full track list has been out for a little bit now, including
4016200	4024680	such wonderful tracks as we mentioned, Strong Bad, Trogdor, The Burninator, from, you know,
4024680	4029920	the Homestar Runner, yes, Homestar Runner Flash animation.
4029920	4035960	And if you happen to be a fan of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, you might recognize this band
4035960	4044000	Death Lock as they perform their hit Thunder Horse, and of course Death Lock is from Meneloc,
4044000	4050280	Meneloc plus the wonderful, very violent show on Adult Swim.
4050280	4053400	I think they had that on the E3 demo, didn't they?
4053400	4054400	I don't think so.
4054400	4056760	I thought, I remembered hearing it.
4056760	4061520	Anyways, some other stuff that they've got coming out, I believe a new Freeze Pops, or
4061520	4067280	another Freeze Pops song on there, Less Talk, More Rock, yay, Freeze Pop, and some other
4067280	4075280	stuff and just a bunch of bands I've never heard of, Honest Bob and the Factory to Deals
4075280	4076280	incentive.
4076280	4080120	Well, these are all, you know, the indie bands that they put in there too, which is kind
4080120	4081120	of cool.
4081120	4084920	So yeah, it's pretty cool, and lots of tracks, so definitely worth picking up if you have
4084920	4085920	a guitar.
4085920	4086920	I don't, so I won't.
4086920	4087920	Well, you can buy the bundle.
4087920	4088920	Why would I do that?
4088920	4090920	I just sold back the guitar.
4090920	4093640	I'm waiting for the 360.
4093640	4094640	Which is a big mistake.
4094640	4097120	Why did you announce the 360 one before this?
4097120	4099940	Because we'd be so pissed if they announced it after.
4099940	4104440	You would be pissed, and I would be pissed, and we'd be on this show yelling and bitching.
4104440	4106440	But we'd buy it anyways.
4106440	4107440	Probably.
4107440	4115220	All right, let's talk about now Guitar Hero 2 is coming out in a couple weeks, but coming
4115220	4119600	out this week, if you are in Japan, let's talk about some release dates.
4119600	4123960	Xbox 360 is having a ton of stuff go to their Platinum Collection in Japan this week, including
4123960	4129880	99 Nights, Project Gotham Racing 3, Rumble Roses XX, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and
4129880	4131680	Every Party.
4131680	4136320	Also another Xbox 360 system is coming out.
4136320	4138920	It's kind of their, you know, they talked about this earlier, they're going to release
4138920	4141260	kind of a reduced bundle in Japan.
4141260	4145080	So that is out this week, Xbox Live Vision making its debut as well.
4145080	4149040	For those of you holding out on the PlayStation 2, lots of fans still about the PS2.
4149040	4153100	In Japan, you can get Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.
4153100	4159600	Also coming out, Slaughter Upcore 9 and Gallop Racer in Breed.
4159600	4163040	I don't leave it to you to figure out what that is, but I want to point out, this one
4163040	4164040	gave us this bot.
4164040	4166880	Horses with extra holds on their heads.
4166880	4171160	That's how they translate it, folks.
4171160	4175520	There it is, I'm looking here at this game, the Slaughter Upcore 9, it looks like it has
4175520	4177000	a Go-Go Dancer on the front there.
4177000	4180560	It's a gambling simulator, so it has a little Go-Go Girl on the front there.
4180560	4183480	Let's see, let me look at the box art here for this Gallop Racer.
4183480	4187840	Yeah, it looks like a, it says it right there on the box, look at this, here it is, right
4187840	4188840	there in the studio.
4188840	4192400	Gallop Racer in Breed, right there, 10th anniversary.
4192400	4195000	I'm sorry, but is that like, is that kind of like...
4195000	4197560	If you're an inbred horse, you probably are going to gallop everywhere.
4197560	4198560	Mississippi horse!
4198560	4204480	And I can say that because I'm from the south, so it's a Mississippi horse.
4204480	4208380	Now hold on though, because this doesn't beat what's coming out on the DS, okay?
4208380	4213280	Coming out on the DS in Japan, there's a new Kirby game, Hoshi no Kirby Sanjyou, and Lego
4213280	4219880	Star Wars 2 on the Nintendo DS, but here it is, the title of the week for Japanese imports,
4219880	4225520	Love Hamster on the Nintendo DS.
4225520	4229200	It's a strategy game by Digital Kids, and just look at the box art, look at the box
4229200	4232440	art, how could you not love that hamster?
4232440	4236120	I want the Love Hamster!
4236120	4237720	I'm going to import Love Hamster.
4237720	4244060	I have dwarf hamsters myself, and if it's anything like real hamsters, then they probably
4244060	4248720	should rename it to Hamster Inbreeding.
4248720	4250300	Because they multiply it like crazy.
4250300	4254240	Now just keep in mind, please keep your love hamsters away from your man cannons, okay?
4254240	4258840	Boys and girls, I'd appreciate that.
4258840	4261480	My brain is now swimming from love hamsters.
4261480	4268520	Well, anyway, as for our UK friends, we've got a number of things coming out.
4268520	4273040	On the first, we have Sam & Max Season 1 Culture Shock for PC.
4273040	4277000	On the third, a number of titles, we have Curious George for PlayStation 2, Desperate
4277000	4282100	Housewives for PC, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories on PSP, on just about everything Need
4282100	4287960	for Speed Carbon, Neverwinter Nights 2 on PC, Rule of Rose on PlayStation 2, Scooby
4287960	4292400	Doo Who's Watching Who on a number of things, and SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the
4292400	4300400	Krusty Krab, yeah, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on PC.
4300400	4310880	A few things, though, that should be made a mention of, I'll go ahead and list some
4310880	4314480	of them for the sixth because there's actually the biggest one coming out will be Phantasy
4314480	4319000	Star Universe coming out on the sixth of November.
4319000	4322320	Other things to look forward to within the month, actually, after having played the demo,
4322320	4325120	is WWE SmackDown vs. Raw.
4325120	4326120	It's actually really good.
4326120	4329960	And if you want to beat everybody, use Kane.
4329960	4338040	Okay, anyways, I don't speak wrestling, sorry.
4338040	4344560	Yeah, well, each week we like to talk about some stuff that you may not have heard yet,
4344560	4348280	and this week, of course, I'm going to start things off with a few date changes and a few
4348280	4350920	price reductions like normal.
4350920	4354360	First off, the Xbox 360 games have dropped in price this week.
4354360	4358120	Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 dropped down to $49.99, which is good.
4358120	4361680	Battlefield 2 also dropped down to $49.99.
4361680	4367000	NCAA Football 07, which hasn't been out that long, dropped down to $49.99.
4367000	4369960	Burnout Revenge, which was already cheap to begin with, $29.99.
4369960	4375120	I think all Xbox 360 games should drop to $49.99, a more reasonable price, don't you?
4375120	4380920	Well, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, pretty awesome game, dropped down to $39.99, so that's
4380920	4381920	pretty cool.
4381920	4388480	And, of course, if you don't have a 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox Madden dropped down to $39.99,
4388480	4393560	and the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on PlayStation 2 and Xbox dropped down to $19.99,
4393560	4395560	so not bad.
4395560	4396940	Now some date changes.
4396940	4398360	It's very interesting.
4398360	4402040	A few things you might not have heard yet, including some of the Wii launch titles have
4402040	4405040	been delayed.
4405040	4406120	It's quite interesting.
4406120	4412080	For example, Blazing Angels on the Wii has been delayed to December 6th.
4412080	4418240	Far Cry Instinct's Predator has been delayed to next year, January 16th, which is very
4418240	4419400	interesting.
4419400	4424080	Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Wii has been delayed to December 7th.
4424080	4427080	Call of Duty 3 has also been delayed to December 7th.
4427080	4430360	And Marvel Ultimate Alliance, December 7th.
4430360	4435720	So Activision, something happened there because all their titles got delayed.
4435720	4441160	If you're looking for Elder Scrolls Oblivion on the PS3, I mentioned it was a launch title,
4441160	4445040	but of course that's the launch window, not launch day.
4445040	4450840	December 12th, it's already starting its move into March, kind of like the 360 version
4450840	4453080	was.
4453080	4455560	It's slowly sneaking away.
4455560	4460560	Some other games you might also be looking forward to, especially not on the PS3, but
4460560	4464200	on the 360, Fusion Frenzy 2 won't be coming out this year.
4464200	4469500	It's coming out January 16th of next year.
4469500	4475080	Some games also announced Warriors on the PSP is coming out December 13th.
4475080	4480560	Silent Hill Origins has also been delayed to next year, so you won't be seeing that
4480560	4483840	until at least January 17th.
4483840	4487240	I want to say I read somewhere there's some major reworking going on there, which is why
4487240	4488240	it was delayed.
4488240	4490280	That date has been bouncing around this week like crazy.
4490280	4492520	It was in March at one time this week.
4492520	4493600	It's nuts.
4493600	4498600	One point though about that is that if you go in the Akira Yamaoka community on Live
4498600	4504280	Journal, there's actually previews to some of the tracks in the game.
4504280	4508400	And then finally, two other titles were announced from Buena Vista Interactive that you haven't
4508400	4510960	heard about yet on systems.
4510960	4514880	Pirates of the Caribbean 3, of course that's a working title, is going to be coming out
4514880	4523080	on PlayStation 3, the Wii, Xbox 360, DS, and PSP May 16th of next year.
4523080	4525480	And God, why are they making this game?
4525480	4529640	High School Musical The Game is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and
4529640	4533680	the DS on July 11th.
4533680	4536760	Those are your dates for the week for exclusive stuff.
4536760	4541480	Real quickly, footy monsters dyin' in chat here wants to know, you know the release date
4541480	4545560	for Splinter Cell Double Agent on PS2?
4545560	4547240	Splinter Cell Double Agent?
4547240	4548240	For the US?
4548240	4549240	Yeah.
4549240	4552240	That was actually last week?
4552240	4553240	For PS2?
4553240	4556220	Yeah, it came out a week after, after the 360.
4556220	4559840	So that was last week.
4559840	4563960	Some other stuff, of course, releases for this week.
4563960	4565560	We've got lots of big stuff.
4565560	4572960	This is kind of getting into the whole, you know, kind of end of the year push.
4572960	4576520	Need for Speed Carbon on pretty much every single system out there except for the PlayStation
4576520	4579640	3 and Wii, because those are coming out a little bit later.
4579640	4587080	Of course you've got Children of Mana on the DS, Pokemon Ranger on the DS.
4587080	4590280	Of course Final Fantasy XII, because that's awesome.
4590280	4597640	On the 360 you've got F.E.A.R., which is going to be pretty sweet.
4597640	4601960	I think that was the only 360, oh FIFA Soccer 07, because it's been delayed.
4601960	4606640	On Xbox, a lot more Racing Mania 2007, awesome.
4606640	4612200	And of course my favorites on the PSP, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
4612200	4616880	And if you're not in the Vice City Stories, Death Junior Root of Evil, Killzone Liberation,
4616880	4623240	Blind Quiz, which is by the guy that did Brain Age, and Power Stone Collection, which is
4623240	4625600	pretty cool.
4625600	4629920	So that's a little slice of the stuff coming out, not everything of course.
4629920	4635360	As far as things coming out much later, it was actually listed in the official Xbox 360
4635360	4641440	magazine that Bethesda is working on a game that uses the Unreal Engine 3 called Rogue
4641440	4642440	Warrior.
4642440	4646920	It's also going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 3.
4646920	4649560	It's a multiplayer anti-terrorism game.
4649560	4655040	It's actually based on books by Richard Marcinko, I think that's how it's pronounced, and being
4655040	4656680	developed by Zombie Studios.
4656680	4658480	They worked on Shadow Ops prior.
4658480	4665440	It has some different modes, including one that generates a map based on what the teams
4665440	4669640	decide on beforehand, like a cooperative map.
4669640	4674280	And you're the only one who will know the territory you start off in.
4674280	4679320	Also has a four player co-op mode, 24 and other multiplayer modes.
4679320	4686720	Sounds pretty cool, actually, if you like those types of games.
4686720	4688320	I like Bethesda.
4688320	4691400	Yeah, I like Bethesda too.
4691400	4694320	We have a series of oopsie things to report.
4694320	4695800	There's been a lot of oopsies.
4695800	4701760	Remember last week, the big, big oopsie with Bubble Bobble on the DS?
4701760	4705400	Nothing quite that major, but a couple big oopsies nonetheless.
4705400	4711160	Somebody noticed just now that, I believe this was on NeoGAF, those big forums over
4711160	4718140	there, noticed that the GameCube Killer7 box, if you look at the back, it points you to
4718140	4723520	a website, www.killer7.com.
4723520	4725880	Killer7.com is a porno site.
4725880	4730640	The correct site should have been killer-7.com.
4730640	4733160	Are you going to killer7.com right now, Loki?
4733160	4735160	No, I'm not.
4735160	4737520	Someone is sending me a private message.
4737520	4739360	I saw him reach for the keyboard as I said that.
4739360	4741800	I thought he was going to check that out right now.
4741800	4747240	Certainly a lot of free publicity for that porno site this week, thanks to Capcom's proofreading
4747240	4748240	team.
4748240	4750400	Good job, Capcom.
4750400	4755960	Some other funny oopsies have been going on, like in Glasgow, because apparently Wii's
4755960	4761760	out over there, according to some of their clocks, which have been incorrectly set up.
4761760	4766600	It's their countdown clocks that they have for the Wii, so now it's just saying out now,
4766600	4769920	but I don't know, big deal.
4769920	4771760	So someone messed up a clock.
4771760	4777040	Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing to put on the internet, like, hey, somebody can't set
4777040	4780080	a clock, that's gaming news.
4780080	4785240	But I guess some folks are curious what it's going to look like when all is said and done.
4785240	4787960	Couple website oopsies going on right now.
4787960	4795540	Walmart was listing the PlayStation 3 for $299.82.
4795540	4801240	Keep in mind the PlayStation 3 is supposed to cost at least $4.99 for the low one, $5.99
4801240	4802240	for the high one.
4802240	4805320	Well, you know they do sell a lot of stuff as lost leaders.
4805320	4808280	Yeah, but I don't think it's supposed to be that low.
4808280	4810400	I think someone made a boo-boo.
4810400	4811400	Someone copied the...
4811400	4812400	Pulling back prices.
4812400	4816960	That sounds like the Xbox 360 price right there, $299.82.
4816960	4821520	Also a late-breaking oopsie we got posted to our forums just before the show, I believe,
4821520	4829160	Tiger Claw pointed this out, CompUSA was listing a Nintendo Wii for $1,100, and I thought the
4829160	4831760	Wii was supposed to be the affordable system.
4831760	4833160	That's Canadian.
4833160	4839920	Needless to say, someone's getting fired.
4839920	4842000	Maybe we should make this oopsie thing a regular segment.
4842000	4843960	There certainly are enough mistakes going on out there.
4843960	4847680	I don't know what to say about that.
4847680	4849400	Apparently the Wii thing is still up.
4849400	4851320	Tiger Claw is posting a link in our chat right now.
4851320	4856720	Let me go ahead and do that, and I'll paste that in right now.
4856720	4859280	I know this is wonderful radio here.
4859280	4862240	Oh yeah, there it is.
4862240	4866540	Wii console, $1,119.06.
4866540	4869720	Someone made a little bit of a mistake there.
4869720	4871120	Good job, CompUSA.
4871120	4875120	Leaking games early, selling Wiis for a couple of times.
4875120	4878160	That's got to be one hell of a Wii.
4878160	4881560	It better have other Wii attachments with it.
4881560	4883640	Like the Mantennen.
4883640	4884640	And the Penetrator.
4884640	4888640	And the Love Hamster.
4888640	4893160	Every week DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth
4893160	4899920	and all around, and she finds a website appropriate to share with y'all.
4899920	4902480	Is it killer7.com, your website of the week this week?
4902480	4903480	No.
4903480	4904480	Okay.
4904480	4911720	She's got a website of the week, and she's going to share it with you right now.
4911720	4918040	Today's website of the week is the Misadventures of Hello Cthulhu.
4918040	4923160	It's a really messed up little webcomic that one of my friends in the Doctor Who fandom
4923160	4927960	linked to me, that's about Cthulhu being dropped in the Hello Kitty universe.
4927960	4935560	Yes, the Elder God, Cthulhu in the Hello Kitty universe, with ribbons on his tentacles.
4935560	4939320	It's very funny, and I recommend everybody go read it all the way through, because trust
4939320	4946560	me, it sort of has continuity, but not really, because it's just messed up, especially when
4946560	4953960	he turns Keropi into his evil minion, the demon Keropi.
4953960	4963240	So the site is, and I will link it in the chatroom, www.hello-cthulhu.com, hellokuthulu.com,
4963240	4964660	with a dash in there.
4964660	4968740	And it's really messed up, especially also when the shark pirate captain shows up and
4968740	4969740	they steal his stuff.
4969740	4971240	Has Batsmaru in it at all, my favorite?
4971240	4975880	I haven't seen Batsmaru yet, I've seen Pompompurin, and I've also seen the tentacle monster version
4975880	4978120	of Pompompurin too.
4978120	4984400	My favorite part is when they go to the island and are attacked by the cheese grater monster.
4984400	4986000	It's really random, I recommend it.
4986000	4991840	If you liked Kawaii Knot, Hello Cthulhu is even worse.
4991840	4996880	Hey, before we get to the next story, I want to point out that Nintendo Maniac 64 in our
4996880	5003080	chatroom noticed that that amount that they were charging for the Wii on CompUSA, $1,119,
5003080	5006080	is the release date of the Wii, $1,119.
5006080	5007380	Good job, good eyes.
5007380	5010540	So somebody just screwed up when putting things in the database and put the date where the
5010540	5015640	price goes, and oops, and caused panic amongst game bloggers everywhere.
5015640	5017640	What can you do?
5017640	5021920	Well there is a little bit more news that I have for everybody.
5021920	5024760	Something that may interest somebody in the room, except I think she already knows about
5024760	5028800	it, is the LocoRoco Halloween demo.
5028800	5038240	It also comes with a firmware update for the PSP, bringing it to 2.82.
5038240	5047200	Basically according to our expert friends at Sony, who again, expert is used very loosely,
5047200	5052580	it has the extras, things that are changed, we think we've covered all this before, but
5052580	5056480	you don't really need it to play the LocoRoco demo.
5056480	5062860	You can still play it with 2.71 firmware.
5062860	5068440	For European gamers, you can download the firmware update from yourpsp.com, or you can
5068440	5070960	also use the US one, it doesn't really matter.
5070960	5073840	The LocoRoco demo is available online.
5073840	5076000	It also has a US and European version.
5076000	5078320	I wonder if anyone is going to dress up as a LocoRoco for Halloween.
5078320	5079320	That would be kind of cute.
5079320	5080320	I'm not.
5080320	5081320	I'm going to be a pirate.
5081320	5082640	I don't have a costume picked out yet.
5082640	5086120	I never pick out my costume until the day of Halloween, actually.
5086120	5087600	I've got this long wig.
5087600	5090200	I'm going to be a pirate.
5090200	5091200	Arr.
5091200	5093440	Okay, by the way, I made a mistake.
5093440	5098840	It was actually Black Boy who noticed it first, that the CompUSA screw up.
5098840	5103160	Nintendo Maniac was just the first to type it in all caps, so I saw it.
5103160	5106920	Not to encourage you all in chat to type in all caps, damn you.
5106920	5110880	All right, it's getting towards the end of this segment, so that means it's time to hear
5110880	5114480	a little bit of new DDR music.
5114480	5118200	For the past eight weeks, if you can believe it, we have been premiering new songs from
5118200	5122360	Dance Dance Revolution Universe, which will be coming out on the Xbox 360, sounds like
5122360	5127920	next year, and DDR Ultramix 4, which I believe is next month.
5127920	5128920	It's in November.
5128920	5131880	I believe is when it's coming out, right, Loki?
5131880	5133360	Ultramix 4 is in November still?
5133360	5136800	Yes, Ultramix 4 is November 15th, last we heard.
5136800	5137800	All right.
5137800	5139200	I think the bundle's delayed a week, which is weird.
5139200	5140520	They did the same thing with Supernova.
5140520	5141520	I don't know why.
5141520	5142520	Hmm.
5142520	5143520	Maybe.
5143520	5146480	All right, well, anyway, we have some new songs for you guys, so you can check out some
5146480	5149080	of the songs you'll be able to dance to in these new games.
5149080	5153360	We're going to start off this last batch of songs with a song from DDR Universe.
5153360	5158600	It's a group called Geomancer, and the song is called Hydrasound, and it's going to start
5158600	5174920	off our previews tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5174920	5202920	It's called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound,
5202920	5230920	and the song is called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound, and the song is
5230920	5256200	called Hydrasound, and the song is called Hydrasound.
5256200	5261280	And that was Hydrasound by Geomancer here on the DDR Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio
5261280	5263240	coming soon to DDR Universe.
5263240	5265640	All right, let's go into our next song.
5265640	5267400	It's from DDR UltraMix 4.
5267400	5271960	It's by an artist called Steve Porter, and the song is called Sock'em, and it's coming
5271960	5280960	to DDR UltraMix 4.
5280960	5307600	All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Sock'em, and the song is called
5307600	5325920	Hydrasound.
5325920	5353920	All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.
5353920	5381680	All right, we're getting down to the end here, and we have our last song we're going to preview
5381680	5387320	here from DDR Universe, and it's from an artist you might have recognized from the UltraMix
5387320	5392320	series because this artist showed up in quite a few of the games, or if is has a song in
5392320	5396560	DDR Universe, and it's called The Hop, and you're going to hear it right now on the DDR
5396560	5422000	Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio.
5422000	5450000	All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.
5450000	5478000	All right, let's go into our next song, which is called Hydrasound.
5478000	5501000	And now, the very last song of our DDR previews, and before we get to this, I just want to
5501000	5506720	say a big thanks to Konami of Hawaii for giving us the opportunity to give you guys something
5506720	5508840	a little bit special here, obviously.
5508840	5512980	If you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, you know that we've always been longtime supporters
5512980	5517240	of music-based games, and of course, DDR being at the forefront of that, and it's very cool
5517240	5523720	that Konami took a chance on independent radio with this type of news, so it's very cool,
5523720	5525880	so thanks guys so much.
5525880	5530180	And we're going to go into a song here from DDR UltraMix IV, and it's by a group called
5530180	5534520	Blue October, but it's not the same Blue October.
5534520	5539140	This is Blue October UK, not the Blue October that sings that,
5539140	5543360	Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.
5543360	5544520	This band's a lot less emo.
5544520	5546640	They're on the different drum label.
5546640	5551160	This is a song called Free, the Liberation Mix, and it's coming to DDR UltraMix IV.
5551160	5552160	Enjoy.
5552160	5553160	Blue October UK.
5553160	5569560	This is Blue October UK, not the Blue October that sings that.
5569560	5586240	Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.
5586240	5609040	Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.
5609040	5635000	Hey, Blue October, hey, Blue October.
5635000	5654360	Free, the Liberation Mix, by Blue October UK, here on Orange Lounge Radio, the last
5654360	5657200	song in our DDR sneak peeks.
5657200	5660840	And that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
5660840	5663680	So did you guys like those songs?
5663680	5664680	I thought it was pretty good.
5664680	5665680	I liked that last one, especially.
5665680	5668480	It was kind of light and airy and trance-y.
5668480	5670360	It was a little too trance-y.
5670360	5672360	Yeah, you're not a big trance fan, huh?
5672360	5673880	You said you liked the one.
5673880	5675680	What did we play in there?
5675680	5676800	The Steve Porter one.
5676800	5677800	You said you liked that one.
5677800	5678800	Yes?
5678800	5679800	Dark Saga?
5679800	5680800	Quit taking pictures with your phone.
5680800	5681800	You liked the Steve Porter one, though.
5681800	5682800	Yes?
5682800	5683800	It was all right.
5683800	5684800	Yeah?
5684800	5685800	All right.
5685800	5686800	Good times.
5686800	5688320	I'm going to be starting a new feature on our website, by the way, that's going to be
5688320	5690720	my phone cam picture of the show.
5690720	5691960	Oh, God.
5691960	5692960	A very unflattering picture.
5692960	5699040	You can see me trying to, because now I'm experimenting with facial hair this week.
5699040	5702720	It's the first time in my life I've tried to grow a beard here, so it's something new.
5702720	5707200	As far as the DDR sneak previews, I liked the Orifice one.
5707200	5713680	I've actually met Zonk live, and actually, the Orifice guy is the producer for Zonk,
5713680	5715920	so yeah, I really liked the Orifice one.
5715920	5717960	It was really kind of different.
5717960	5718960	Yeah.
5718960	5724280	Now, I have to admit, the songs in the previous games weren't so hot to me, but that one I
5724280	5725280	liked.
5725280	5727520	I can see myself really playing that one, and I liked Zonk a lot.
5727520	5732960	I liked their remix of Love This Feelin' that they did previously, so I know it was kind
5732960	5734600	of a controversial song in the community.
5734600	5736360	Some folks are like, why did they do that song?
5736360	5738440	But I liked it, so pretty cool.
5738440	5739440	All right.
5739440	5744480	Well, we are going to say goodbye for now, but we'll be back in a little bit with Orange
5744480	5749720	Lounge Radio Part B. Those of you guys listening live here on Sunday night on orangeloungeradio.com,
