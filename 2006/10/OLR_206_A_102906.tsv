14009	26574	Tonight, October 29th, 2006, Halo movie news and Halo 3 tidbits, Sony and UK importers go to war, and could custom character creation cause trouble for one gaming company?
27894	38919	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there in the land of internet broadcasting and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
38959	40299	It is episode number 206 for this
42188	43169	October the 29th of 2006.
44769	50533	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know, gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.
51093	52113	I'm here to help you through that.
52153	53014	My name is Rob Roberts.
53034	53954	You might know me as Sky.
54014	59397	Joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host over there in that corner, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
59718	62399	I've taken a vow of silence for five seconds.
63159	63400	Great.
63420	64600	Then I'll introduce Loki.
64980	65481	I give up.
67702	68242	How are you doing?
68262	68903	Seriously, though, Jamie?
69863	70243	Head.
70603	71624	You have a little headache?
71980	72901	Little... I'm sorry.
73021	74742	It was a migraine earlier, but I feel a lot better now.
74782	75222	I'm very hyper.
75262	75922	Thanks for my coffee.
76823	77183	Oh, goody.
77203	78264	We have a hyper Jamie tonight.
78644	80425	That always makes for a fun show.
80765	81685	And you forgot.
82026	82186	What?
83767	85127	When are we going to set that thing on fire?
85488	86248	Mine!
86908	88209	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
88529	88950	Hello.
89210	89710	How you doing?
90050	90270	Good.
90470	91231	How'd the move go?
92071	93572	It went good.
93632	95873	I'm just, you know, without internet until tomorrow.
96294	96894	That's got to stink.
97662	105470	Not really, because I just play... Well, actually, it's been so busy with unpacking, you know, last minute apartment stuff and all that stuff.
106291	108413	Really haven't had a chance to, like, sit down.
108633	113759	But I have been stealing my neighbor's wireless, but it only seems to work for about five minutes at a time.
114139	115841	So, you know, I get on there real quickly and
116818	120802	Read news and try to check my email, and that doesn't always work.
121022	124265	Have you tried to look at the shared folders on the network to see if there's porn anywhere?
124325	129529	Actually, her network is unsecured, but her shared folders are password protected.
129810	130050	Interesting.
130070	131952	So they got it halfway right.
133873	139198	Not that we endorse stealing Wi-Fi, but hey, if you're going to leave it open, people might use it.
139727	140007	All right.
140308	141609	We have a special guest with us tonight.
141969	146392	And this is nice because we actually have someone who I believe has never been on the program before.
146453	148935	So it's nice to have some new blood on the show once in a while.
149235	151016	So say hello, everyone, to Renee.
151737	152037	Yay.
152097	152738	Hi, I'm here.
152758	153598	How are you doing, Renee?
153819	154299	I'm good.
154639	158222	Don't be afraid to just put that mic right up to your mouth because they're not that sensitive, unfortunately.
158703	159063	All right.
159383	160004	Is this better?
160404	162766	Their emotions are sensitive, though, so don't make fun of them.
162926	164707	We just want to make sure they can all hear you.
165508	165828	All right.
166008	167790	So you've been a listener of Orange Launch for a little while, right?
168519	169259	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
194325	196488	So, but you're here and you brought your box with you.
196508	197269	Yeah, I brought my box.
197349	197930	It has holes.
199131	199972	Very nice.
200914	205039	Now, kids on the internet who are going to read into that statement, just, you know, freaking...
205552	207012	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
235798	242345	I guess I like RPGs, rhythm and simulation type games, puzzles.
242665	243826	Alright, very cool.
243986	245508	The typical gamer girl.
247318	248659	Well, welcome to the program.
248979	249380	Thank you.
249440	250741	Now, something occurred to me this morning.
250781	253443	You actually, at one point, worked in the industry a little bit, didn't you?
253463	254203	I still do, actually.
254243	254644	You do?
254664	255104	Yes, I do.
255124	255404	Really?
255504	257946	I know you used to work at Konami a couple years ago.
257966	259007	I used to work at Konami.
259027	261089	That's where I actually started off.
261809	270356	I have been in the DDR community for a while, and that's when I started listening to Orange Lounge Radio because that's where all the cool kids went to.
270416	271497	They listened to Orange Lounge.
271537	272498	Love the endorsement.
272538	272838	Love it.
272878	273158	Thank you.
274611	278955	and I met Mike Ngo, also known as Asian Innovation.
279556	280357	Best rapper ever.
282979	285822	Not if you have to deal with him rapping at work, I'll tell you that.
286042	287684	No, but his drunken rap's pretty funny.
287744	290747	Oh my god, it is pretty funny.
291207	291788	And so I...
293053	297217	I met him and he said, you know, do you like video games?
297237	297998	I'm like, yeah.
298338	300540	Would you like to be a video game tester at Konami?
300901	301842	And he said, sure.
302242	304885	And so that's where I started off at Konami.
305005	309810	I started doing step data and then I moved into functionality QA testing.
310711	314935	And then I left QA to go pursue other things.
316576	317817	It happens, it happens.
317837	318398	You move on.
318478	325462	Yeah, and then actually I went back into the video game industry to go to LucasArts, and I was a QA tester there.
325602	329204	I did compliance testing, so that's like standards, first-party standards.
329244	337769	So, you know, testing to make sure that if we are developing a game for Microsoft or Sony that they have the right terminology or, you know, doesn't...
338809	348954	That's what I've heard from some people in the industry is that those companies are very strict on, you know, you have to call this button like the, you know, the Xbox 360 guide button is the official.
349154	354776	And like whenever you can't say, oh, that center silver glowing button or the silver button on the cover, it has to be the guide button.
354896	355377	Exactly.
356157	362060	And, you know, Microsoft and especially Sony, they're very stringent that you have to use...
363550	364592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
374369	375309	Bad things happen, yeah.
376010	376610	That's interesting.
376650	382033	So there's a lot more that goes into putting a game on a multi-platform than you might think at first.
382113	382893	Oh, definitely.
383013	396721	I've seen games fail submission from going into production just because of the fact that the message that comes up when you unplug your controller wasn't correct.
396941	397762	Wow.
397842	398022	Yeah.
398642	399763	That's a lot of money too.
400023	406646	It's like at least a couple thousand each time you submit to Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo.
407166	407707	Wow.
407767	407947	Yes.
408267	408787	Interesting.
409027	409868	Well, thanks for the insight.
409888	410468	That's pretty awesome.
410488	411529	No problem.
411589	415611	And right now, I'm working at Perpetual Entertainment.
417431	424755	They haven't come up with any games yet, but the two games that they do have in development is Gods and Heroes, Rome Rising, and Star Trek Online.
425616	425756	Oh.
425996	426416	Star Trek Online.
426778	427499	Star Trek Online?
427899	428119	Yes.
428319	429020	Awesome.
429060	430020	Oh, that's something I might get into.
430040	430981	I'm the resident Trekkie.
432002	433903	I'm a closet Trekkie, a little bit.
433923	437106	Shh, don't tell anyone, but I like Treks.
437386	440248	So you're in the closet for some things, but out of the closet for others.
441729	442129	Yes.
442270	443751	I appreciate that.
443771	445092	I'm still kidnapping you to go see Warp 11.
446207	447788	DMN says that DNL is his hero.
447808	449009	Because your name in the online world is DNL.
449049	449510	Yes, it is.
474040	475521	DNL is DMN's hero.
475561	476402	That's a lot of initials.
476622	477943	We have alphabet soup going on here.
478383	482607	Alright, well, let's get into what we do at the top of every show and talk about our gaming week.
483047	484748	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
484788	486249	I played stuff, actually.
486309	486509	Really?
486549	486970	What'd you play?
487150	491033	Well, we had a barbecue at my place last night that somebody who was invited didn't show up for.
491613	492654	Sorry, other things, you know.
492694	493134	That's okay.
493154	493515	Busy boy.
493675	494215	I have to tease.
495136	501320	But we broke out the 360 and played... Okay, we had to see how awful the Sonic demo was.
501360	503222	Dan's actually pretty damn good at controlling that.
503737	504277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
521041	521741	That was pretty funny.
521821	531164	And then they put up the fear demo, but it was actually cool because Alex had been playing it on PC and was going through the differences between the PC and the Xbox 360.
531224	534484	In his opinion, he said it was actually pretty damn close.
535465	540306	And I have to say that I'm probably going to play fear if I don't get motion sick from it.
540686	545007	The demo did not make me that motion sick because first person shooters always do that to me.
546188	548612	I love, though, the very freaky elements.
548692	549573	Dan's like, okay, watch this.
549593	550675	This is about to get all Silent Hill.
551015	551296	Look!
552137	554020	I was like, ooh, blood.
556171	563997	I did hang out with Jamie this week outside the show, which was fun, and I got to see the walkthrough of the Fear demo as well, and it looked pretty neat.
564057	570622	I don't usually get into first-person shooters, but I like the whole freaky element that Fear has going on, and I kind of missed it on the PC.
570662	573124	I don't do a whole lot of gaming on the PC.
573204	575345	I apologize to our PC gamer fans.
575425	580389	There's a couple once in a while that'll make me look, but Fear's maybe something I'll look at on the console, for sure.
581109	586110	Well, apart from that, I actually played my first game.
586391	590072	Actually, I had Dan play it for me because I was sort of, my eyes hurt.
590552	595833	So he played Uno on my gamer tag, and my first game was one with a draw four.
596913	597774	So I was like, hey!
598014	602195	And then we saw somebody picking their nose on the webcam.
602395	606856	That's pretty tame compared to a lot of things I've heard that people are seeing on Uno webcams.
607296	609197	Nothing is as fun as Dan shit-talking, though.
609727	610587	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
634986	637228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
660319	666021	I'm like, okay, but the voice acting sort of irritates me, and hearing the main song in English irritates me as well.
666041	668702	I was like, whoever they got to sing just can't.
670162	676584	I have a very bad problem with professional singers who are tone deaf, because that's what this lady sounded like.
677724	681946	And so that was really it for my gaming week.
681986	687627	I did try to play a little bit of Pirate King, but I had some computer issues, and I think I'm just not going to play that anymore.
687787	689408	It got kind of boring really fast.
690854	692975	It's a cute game, just boring.
693716	695317	Alex in our chatroom offers some advice.
695337	697298	He says, yeah, Jamie, it's been doing that to everyone.
697338	700721	You'll have to keep trying until it works in regards to Phantasy Star Universe.
701641	704163	It did that to me once, but then when I went back in, it worked.
705084	711869	Well, I'm thinking that I'm going to try to recreate my Ranger character.
712611	714713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
737122	738143	Thanks for watching!
759166	764649	They were a very busy store, but for as busy as they were, I was noticing that they were trying to give everybody attention.
765529	769271	And that, to me, was just really kind of refreshing to see at a game store.
769511	777815	That's good advice for any employees that we might have that listen to this show, because I know we do have some employees of certain games, not just GameStop, but GameCrazy, all the other ones, too.
777835	781857	My hubby is no longer associated with GameStop, but that still doesn't mean I hate them.
782317	782557	All righty.
783442	785804	Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
806089	809490	Die or Explode or just glitches in the game.
810230	812251	And yeah, it's really entertaining.
812491	817873	I played the Tony Hawk's Project 8 demo and I don't care for it one bit.
817953	819433	I mean, it's a great game, I'm sure.
819833	821154	It's just it's too technical now.
821314	830357	If you aren't really into Tony Hawk and you're picking this up the first time to go into it, you're going to have trouble doing a lot of stuff.
830417	834618	I felt an awful lot, whereas Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it was
835177	839479	It was fun to be able to pull off crazy stuff, and it wasn't too hard.
839819	848182	Now they're just giving you way too much damn control over stuff, and I think that'd be good if you know what you're doing, but if you don't know what you're doing, that's not really good.
848422	848742	I don't know.
849502	852263	It's pretty, though, so I don't know.
853504	855044	What was the other demo I was going to try?
856085	859666	I meant to try Rainbow Six, but I was waiting for...
860515	861116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
880509	882030	We're waiting for Vice City Stories.
882110	885072	It's coming out on Tuesday, so we'll be able to switch out the games pretty soon.
885092	889075	So I'll have a full review of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories next week.
889555	901162	In the meantime, though, we're finishing up Liberty City Stories, and I am still kicking major ass in our killing spree at work.
901863	906085	So far, I'm ahead by, I think, 30 kills, which is awesome.
906966	907206	All right.
908007	908347	Anything else?
909430	910692	Um, no.
922276	923196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
950026	950586	I just don't know.
950606	951086	For half the game?
951566	952547	For half the PSP version?
953007	955467	Well, it's just... I don't know.
956127	957147	It's okay, I guess.
957247	959628	But I have problems with some of the graphics in there.
959948	963169	Like, some of the tile sets that they have are hard to see.
963389	963629	Yeah.
963749	966029	And it really hurts my eyes to try to concentrate on it.
967229	971670	If they had an option to keep a specific tile set and just change the music or something, that would be great.
971690	974871	Well, you can do that in a different mode, but then you don't unlock new skins.
975506	977186	Thank you very much, Q Entertainment.
1005723	1015009	Alright, my gaming week, I played Phantasy Star Universe, now I can finally talk about it because I've played the commercial release, and so I feel a little better giving a full review of this game.
1016129	1023834	I like Phantasy Star Universe a lot because it's different from other MMOs because it's a little more action-oriented from what you're used to.
1024194	1034280	You know, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft have action elements, but in the end, I feel that Phantasy Star Universe is a lot more kind of action-oriented than the others.
1034640	1035561	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1063275	1066397	But I agree with Jamie that whoever's singing that opening song is pretty bad.
1066957	1068878	But you know, a lot of animes have cheesy openings.
1068918	1075481	But literally, you play the game in chapters, and every chapter starts off with the same cheesy anime-ish opening.
1075521	1078042	It's not actual anime, but they use the in-game engine to do it.
1078322	1078903	But you'll see what I mean.
1078923	1079883	It's set up just like an anime.
1080803	1083785	But the funny thing is, when you beat a chapter, then it goes like...
1084145	1086285	Next time on Phantasy Star Universe.
1086345	1088586	It's really funny, so I love the way it's set up.
1088886	1090146	And I don't think the story's that bad.
1090406	1093707	The only thing I don't like is that there's odd loading in cutscenes.
1093887	1095627	Like, they don't load the cutscene all at once.
1095667	1098288	Like, they'll load half, and then there's a cutscene, and then they do another.
1098628	1099248	It's kind of weird.
1099448	1102528	So, it's got some weird loading issues, but you kind of get over that.
1104369	1111710	The other thing I think I don't... I don't... It doesn't settle well with me in Phantasy Star Universe is that it seems like the...
1112782	1113743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1142102	1142862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1165868	1166649	Thank you for watching!
1180715	1181736	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1210222	1216346	Let's see, the other game I want to talk about really quickly is Clubhouse Games for the DS, because I picked it up, but I haven't really talked about it on the show.
1216966	1224371	It's pretty cool, there's a lot, a lot of games on it, and I think that value alone makes it worth a purchase if you're into the casual games.
1224631	1229935	If you're not into casual games, you want something with more depth, I don't think there's going to be a whole lot here for you.
1229995	1231896	They try to make it a little longer...
1232476	1236358	Gameplay and kind of streamline it all together with things like mission mode and stamp mode.
1236738	1241160	But overall, it's nothing more than just an excuse to make you try every single game.
1241480	1244142	I was a little disappointed that online doesn't have certain games in it.
1245202	1247183	So be careful before you pick up the game.
1247803	1253826	Do some research online and see if the games you want to play online are even playable because they aren't all playable online.
1253886	1254486	So be careful.
1256127	1258428	Well, if you want, I have that music queued up.
1258468	1259409	Yeah, let me see.
1259429	1261370	If it'll come through, hopefully.
1261530	1261890	It should.
1262594	1263535	I'm starting the level over.
1263575	1264995	Oh, it's like a cheesy MIDI version of it.
1265035	1265476	I can hear it.
1270238	1271639	Yeah, it's like a cheesy MIDI version of it.
1271739	1272920	I guess for a phone it's not bad.
1272940	1274340	It'll pick up in a second.
1280204	1285306	Now, see, this makes me kind of go, why isn't this on the Xbox Live one?
1285326	1289349	This is like the best song in the game, and they got it on the frickin' cell phone, but they didn't get it on Xbox Live?
1289869	1290389	That's weird.
1291230	1291450	Oh, well.
1291730	1291950	Anyway...
1292489	1292949	Thank you, Jamie.
1294029	1295030	I think it turned out pretty nicely.
1295730	1297190	Yeah, for a cell phone game, that's not bad.
1297210	1298611	You know I hate cell phone games usually.
1298891	1301712	All right, Renee, how was your gaming week?
1301732	1302672	What kind of games have you been playing?
1303452	1309014	Well, besides the Hero Quest, I have been playing Clubhouse games as well.
1311195	1317117	I don't really have Wi-Fi set up at my house, and so I've been stealing Wi-Fi from the Metreon because I live in San Francisco.
1317917	1321518	And the only game that I've actually been able to play online is Darts.
1322211	1323631	and it's fine.
1325152	1336634	But I do understand that if there are some games that you do like and you definitely want to check out and see if you can play it online because I really was looking forward to playing Split or Spit.
1337494	1339834	Yeah, that was the one I wanted to do too.
1339854	1343435	Yeah, because I totally kill on that.
1343555	1344035	I'm awesome.
1344075	1344835	We should play again.
1344855	1348256	See, we should have totally battled but we can't because you can't play it on the internet.
1348596	1348736	Cry.
1350742	1352623	And I've also played LocoRoco.
1353303	1354684	I really love that game.
1354784	1356605	I've beat it like two times now.
1356785	1357645	And it's really cute.
1358025	1365268	Basically, it's made by SCEI or Sony Computer Entertainment International, which is Sony.
1365849	1373412	And basically, you play as a world and there's these little LocoRocos that are these little yellow blobs.
1374232	1379817	and you help them roll around and get rid of the mojos of the
1382291	1385854	are trying to invade the world, and that's basically it.
1385955	1396944	I guess the closest you can compare it to would be Katamari Damacy, but it's not really... It's kind of hard when you have these very original games to try and compare it to something else.
1397145	1397625	Definitely.
1398045	1400407	Probably people are going like, Phantasy Star Universe is like Zelda.
1400427	1401088	What the hell is he saying?
1401128	1401488	I don't know.
1401629	1403730	The whole sword slashing thing, I don't know.
1404391	1405952	It's the best thing I can name.
1405972	1406353	Yeah.
1407296	1424963	And the reason why I actually started playing LocoRoco again, because I basically beat it about a month ago, was because I had gone to visit the Sony store at the Metreon, a PlayStation store, and they had this little booth set up, and they had these little inflatable LocoRocos.
1425023	1425423	There was like
1427252	1432034	2 1-inch or 1-foot LocoRoco inflatables and then this one huge 3-foot one.
1432714	1437976	And so I walked up to one of the workers there and I said, Oh, are you guys selling these?
1438076	1440177	And he's like, No, actually, sorry.
1440237	1443278	And I made a little pouty face because that's what I do.
1443839	1447440	And so I asked him, Well, can I at least look at it?
1448141	1453383	And so he went behind the booth and he took the smaller one and he handed that to me.
1454004	1461864	and so as soon as I had it in my grasp I held on to it and I gave it a quick little hug and I said, oh it's so cute!
1462529	1463510	and like the girl I am.
1465552	1470376	And of course his heart melted and he's like, oh, well, do you want it?
1470436	1471396	And I'm like, of course.
1471456	1472878	And he's like, well, you can have it for free.
1473318	1475139	And here it is with her today.
1475159	1476440	It's here with me today.
1476681	1480644	And before he could say, I'm just kidding, I squeed and I just ran out.
1480944	1482025	So I'm very happy.
1483686	1485188	You ran away before you could take it back.
1486088	1488390	So that's why I started playing LocoRoco again.
1489371	1490372	Another game that I've been
1491753	1494135	Actually, right now, I just picked up Cooking Mama.
1494915	1498599	In the Bay Area, I've visited at least five different EBs.
1499199	1505365	And I've asked every single time, every time I've gone, and this is multiple occasions, I ask, do you guys have Cooking Mama?
1505445	1510469	And of course, as I've come to expect it, their answer is no.
1511130	1517155	And like the little fangirl of Nintendo DS games I am, I pout.
1517891	1519252	and walk away.
1519992	1530137	But today, when I came to visit Sacramento, I went to the EV Games over in Ardenwood and they had Cooking Mama and right now, Mama is telling me to poke my steak.
1533539	1534259	Wow, okay.
1537781	1540082	What kind of game is this?
1540102	1540803	Mama said.
1540863	1547346	This is some sick, sick twisted little game under the cutesy farce of a Cooking Mama title.
1548004	1550385	Hey, well, you know, whatever Mama wants, she gets.
1551486	1557189	Next we're going to have, like, Cooking Emeril, where he, like, yells out things while you're trying to cook.
1557390	1557750	Bam!
1557990	1558410	Yeah.
1559151	1561612	Mama wants you to come over here and poke my steak.
1563713	1564494	This is dirty.
1564874	1565454	Dirty, dirty.
1565815	1566975	I think I need to get that game.
1568596	1570037	Wow.
1570357	1571958	Maybe there's some girly thing.
1572018	1572498	I don't get it.
1572518	1572999	Oh, well, forget it.
1573039	1573319	I don't know.
1573823	1574063	All right.
1574083	1574764	Well, that's cool.
1574824	1575364	Well, great.
1575664	1577785	And I'm glad you brought... Can I give your local Rokodoll a hug?
1577805	1578666	Yes, you can.
1578706	1579146	You can.
1579166	1579226	Yay.
1579967	1580367	Here I go.
1581507	1582568	This is great radio, by the way.
1584629	1585730	If only you can see Rob now.
1585770	1587051	He has the biggest grin ever.
1587071	1587371	I know.
1587411	1587831	It's cute.
1587891	1588551	It's very cute.
1588692	1590012	I would have tried to steal one, too.
1590112	1593294	But, you know, I would have had to find a worker there that bats for my team.
1593314	1594755	And I don't know if there are any there.
1594815	1596356	So, well, it is San Francisco, for God's sake.
1597475	1600376	The official Sony store is still there at the Metreon, even though Sony sold it, right?
1600396	1600596	It is.
1600616	1601436	The Metreon itself.
1601736	1602117	Exactly.
1602177	1603757	I was at the Metreon last week.
1603937	1604597	That's right.
1604617	1606138	And how was your experience at the Metreon?
1606298	1607779	I saw Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D.
1607799	1609099	Oh, that's right.
1609119	1611820	And I had only had three hours of sleep and had been going all day.
1612280	1615641	So I actually fell asleep during the parts where they're handing out all the presents.
1615981	1620083	But right at the beginning, it's me, Chris, Megzi, and Mecco, who is our friend from Canada.
1620643	1623144	We're all trying to grab the snowflakes at the beginning of the movie.
1623524	1626005	And then me and Megzi are like, ooh, Jack.
1627662	1627802	Huh.
1644794	1647196	When they've had her up there for the different positions and everything.
1647796	1652479	So if you go, and I think it's actually playing through, I think through December.
1653419	1657502	If you go on to, actually just do a search for it, a website will pop up for Disney.
1658222	1663525	And you can actually order your tickets through Fandango, which I highly recommend because it's going to be sold out the whole time.
1663885	1664946	Especially this season, yeah.
1665086	1667647	Yeah, if you can see it anywhere, go see it.
1667908	1670389	Because it's seriously, it is worth the view.
1670809	1671089	Awesome.
1671790	1672030	All right.
1672150	1673891	And sitting in line was kind of fun, but not really.
1674563	1675264	Rob runs out of the room
1703684	1704965	Giddy like a little schoolgirl.
1705345	1706205	That's adorable.
1709807	1712269	In the meantime, the ferret will serenade everybody.
1713109	1713909	Oh, Rob's back.
1714390	1715350	You could have stayed gone.
1715590	1716811	This could have been a ferret show.
1716831	1721974	So I have shirts, so I don't know who wants what, but the white one seems a little more girly, so I'm going to give the white one to Jamie.
1722194	1723434	I wear black, though.
1723454	1724195	You want the black one?
1724215	1724855	What's the black one say?
1724955	1726576	The black one says, let's see.
1726676	1727497	If it's white, I won't wear it.
1727737	1728177	It says.
1729332	1730213	The Quadfather.
1730513	1731354	Okay, I'll take the white one.
1731855	1734738	Okay, then I'll give the black one to Loki because he's kind of dark too.
1736219	1737999	Dark and Gothic and Tragic and all that stuff.
1738019	1740080	Okay, and the Resident God.
1740260	1741420	Oh, this is cool.
1741480	1742480	Unplug and connect.
1742560	1745301	I have some mouse pads as well, so I'm going to give one to Renee as well.
1745321	1745661	Oh, thank you.
1745701	1746361	So there you go.
1746521	1747941	And then you guys get mouse pads too.
1747961	1749202	That's what I wanted.
1750202	1751942	Horizon Wireless Mouse Pad.
1751962	1753742	That's funny because I use Singular.
1753863	1754983	But I thought that was very nice.
1755003	1755603	Me too.
1756203	1758803	I thought that was very nice that our listeners kept this in mind there.
1759004	1759924	So thank you, folks.
1760004	1761284	And I'm also going to give Renee...
1761946	1762266	No problemo.
1762286	1762746	Have fun with that.
1786002	1788044	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping.
1788444	1793028	And to start us off, we are going to reenact the voicemails of the week this week.
1793388	1796530	And we have a very special message from our webmaster.
1796571	1797311	Let's take a listen.
1798372	1799833	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
1799853	1803356	This is Jason, and I have a very special and happy announcement from our webmaster.
1803917	1810079	Starting as of right now, you have a toll-free number that any of you are willing to use.
1810459	1814421	That number first off is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1814801	1816422	That is 1-877-4263-657.
1817062	1825925	This is unfortunately only open to the United States and Canada, but the rest of you still have Skype, and the program will work at any time.
1826465	1827026	Free for you.
1827446	1827866	Have fun.
1828619	1829520	Alright, awesome.
1829580	1831461	So now we're almost like legitimate radio here.
1831481	1834742	We have our own 800 number, or 877 number, but same thing.
1834782	1841066	So we have a new toll-free number for you guys to use, and you can use that in interacting with our station when we take calls a little later in the program.
1841690	1870435	that number once again 877-GAME-OLR that's 877-426-3657 and because of the fact that we have the toll free number now we're thinking this might encourage folks to leave us voicemails so we are going to open up that segment we did a while back we're going to reopen up that segment for the voicemails of the week I'll let you know the topic a little later on in the program we'll take your calls on the new 800 number a little bit later the old 916 number still works for those of you in the area but I imagine most people probably aren't going to want to use that
1871024	1873845	Tonight marks the last week of our DDR previews.
1873965	1876367	New songs for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.
1876787	1878668	Too bad that today's last week.
1878688	1879708	We've been doing it for eight weeks.
1880068	1881509	We've got some new songs for you guys tonight.
1881989	1882850	Very excited about that.
1883610	1885791	Orange Lounge Radio has a brand new YouTube channel.
1886051	1890353	If you listened to last week's episode, I believe I threatened to put something up.
1890493	1892994	Oh, the Loki drunk thing, playing Mario Kart.
1893014	1894255	I threatened to put that up on YouTube.
1894635	1896156	I did, so check that out.
1896176	1900418	We are on YouTube under username Orange Lounge Radio and some folks have already found the videos and are
1900558	1903720	I'm sure that was an excellent quality scene.
1904421	1906582	I think it was formatted for the PSP.
1906682	1907843	It actually didn't come out that bad.
1907863	1908763	It actually came out pretty good.
1909044	1910985	I put some other stuff up there, too.
1911025	1912706	We have some news bits.
1913226	1914887	Remember the Oh, It's So Much Fun clip?
1915288	1916829	That's up there as well on YouTube.
1917089	1923133	But one of them, there's a Guitar Hero story that has DarkSakura and Loki in it, and it came out squished for some reason.
1923153	1923973	The video is squished.
1924033	1925454	It's letterboxed, but not really.
1925554	1927535	So I don't know what to do about that.
1927656	1929777	But it's all there if you folks want to check it out.
1931058	1931759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1951545	1961129	and of course lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation 3 and a lot of things being pulled out of the PlayStation 3 including the fact that they will not have a gamer score system.
1961669	1969653	Originally they were going to be putting out that entitlement system that everyone had a problem with because it kind of ripped off of the Xbox Live Achievement system.
1970073	1973914	Well, that's not going to happen according to Jack Trenton from Sony.
1974615	1977056	There's no gamer score system at all.
1977136	1979877	They just kind of ran out of time and
1980506	1981547	I didn't feel like putting it in there.
1982447	1983448	Very interesting there.
1984248	1997116	If you happen to be lucky enough to snag one of the first PlayStation 3s out there, one of the first 500,000 of course, you may be getting a copy of Talladega Nights on Blu-ray.
1997457	2002880	Because of course they really want to push that Blu-ray format with the Blu-ray drive being in the actual console.
2003400	2005722	So you get to enjoy that Will Ferrell comedy.
2005902	2006762	And it was actually pretty good.
2007423	2008203	Definitely worth it.
2008604	2009044	Kind of like the
2009474	2009875	Spider-Man 2
2019103	2023125	and their launch games have really kind of slimmed down a bit.
2023845	2030228	Sony's first party stuff, they've got Resistance Fall of Man, NBA 07, and Genji Days of Blade.
2031129	2032890	Those will all be launch titles.
2033430	2039453	Now, of course, Lair and Warhawk have been pushed to next year, so you won't see those for a while.
2040113	2069118	some other wonderful third party games so of course the exclusive Full Auto 2 will be coming out from Sega, Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, Ridge Racer 7 and of course they will also be getting versions of Fear, Fight Night Round 3 Elder Scrolls, Oblivion Blazing Angels, Call of Duty 3 Tony Hawk's Project 8 and all the big stuff so it's an interesting launch window I don't know so
2070248	2074335	Anywho, some stuff not Sony related.
2076358	2077180	Luminous Live.
2077280	2083210	Now, there's been, of course, a lot of controversy over the whole buy half of a game, purchase the rest of the game.
2084432	2086373	Later on, you know, kind of format.
2086513	2091074	Well, Mitsuguchi himself actually was interviewed by IGN.
2091554	2093815	And one of the questions they asked him was about that system.
2093895	2095675	And, of course, he supports it.
2096475	2101857	And basically, you know, saying, you know, Luminous, when it came out on the PSP, was more expensive.
2102197	2105098	And he feels that, I guess, you should pay the same price on the 360.
2106298	2107378	Well, thank you very much.
2107518	2112460	I'll remember that when you release any other Q Entertainment games, like the wonderful 99 Nights.
2113510	2114991	Glad I rushed out to buy that one.
2117013	2120936	I actually did rush out to buy 99 Nights because I loved the demo and everything.
2121376	2122757	I got mine for free.
2122857	2124518	Well, la-di-da, lucky you.
2124719	2130843	Glad I didn't spend my... I will say, though, I will not be buying Luminous Plus or Luminous 2.
2132425	2136268	Or any of your Extend Extra, you know, every Extend Extra.
2136948	2138870	Screw you, I'm not buying that crap either.
2139330	2140671	And I will buy them all because I'm a whore.
2141576	2143059	Actually, I probably won't get the PS2 one.
2143079	2147106	That is a little bit of overkill, but I do want Luminous 2, and I do want every Extend Extra, so what can I say?
2148268	2148568	Sorry.
2149550	2149871	Whatever.
2150859	2155322	Alright, um, so that pretty much does it for the big stories that we missed in that little bit of a gap.
2155622	2160366	Um, I want to do some comments from chat real fast, because the chat room's just lit up on some of this stuff.
2160706	2162847	JeremyTodd1 says, they ran out of time.
2163207	2173474	It's kind of interesting to know that the 360 came out a year earlier than PlayStation 3, and yet it has achievements, and so the PlayStation 3 had an extra year to get it, but they couldn't even get this simple feature?
2174015	2175075	I don't know, lack of achievements?
2175115	2176196	Is that going to kill the PS3?
2176496	2177777	I don't think it's a big deal.
2178138	2180239	I don't think that's really a big deal, but, um,
2181189	2185730	I think what's really interesting is some of the launch games not having online support.
2186070	2187971	That is a big deal right there, I think.
2188711	2192211	This just adds one of those little, you know, mouth protectors in Kudaragi's helmet.
2194072	2195752	You know, you're an achievement points whore, Loki.
2196952	2200493	Does this lower your opinion of Sony, or do you really care?
2201093	2207415	If anything, Microsoft has this wonderful achievement system to get me to buy games I normally probably wouldn't buy, or to rent games.
2207475	2208515	It kind of, you know...
2209673	2213374	I don't know, drives the market a little bit to get you to play more games.
2214034	2226558	So, I guess, I guess it would, you know, to be honest, it's not a real deal breaker for me, but I think the lack of online and certain games for them is a deal breaker for me.
2226938	2227818	And the other thing is,
2228634	2232755	They still haven't said what their online service has.
2233215	2236817	And they're saying it's free, but I don't see multiplayer gaming.
2236877	2238037	They showed a friends list.
2238397	2239737	Okay, friends list is free.
2239797	2241278	You get that free with Xbox Live.
2241498	2245699	But they still have not come out and said multiplayer gaming is free.
2245959	2247300	They have not said that yet.
2247740	2250160	So I'm thinking it's probably not free.
2251061	2254862	Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says, What about backwards memory card support for PlayStation 3?
2255322	2258583	Firebomba in our chat says, I thought it wasn't a Sony launch until Ridge Racer game was launched with it.
2282208	2282608	That's true.
2282648	2283529	It's got to be Ridge Racer.
2284130	2284890	Ridge Racer.
2285231	2286472	I had to, at least one more time.
2287072	2287913	I think this is interesting.
2287933	2288313	No, you didn't.
2290015	2295059	Pendro lends an interesting perspective here on the Luminous microtransactions debate.
2295360	2299243	If microtransactions total the price of a normal game, then that's kind of cool.
2299583	2304628	And as somebody had calculated above, if you buy Luminous and all the microtransactions, it's going to be about $35.
2304688	2306449	Well, let me put it this way.
2306529	2306710	It's...
2307310	2320176	It's either they release it on live and you have the option to buy these microtransactions or they just port it and throw it out on a CD or DVD and just put it in there and you get it all anyways.
2320296	2321857	It's all the same game, kind of like Luminous+.
2323077	2328699	What I didn't like about the whole thing is I felt they weren't very upfront about telling us what the game was not going to have.
2328799	2338921	I was very disappointed to find Versus Computer wasn't there, because that's kind of a way you could unlock skins in the original PSP version, so I kind of went there to try and unlock more skins, and you kind of couldn't do it.
2339322	2345403	So that was a little bit disappointing, and I didn't realize that feature was going to be gone, or, well, have one stage only.
2345423	2349144	I can understand downloading more skins, but I don't like downloading new features.
2349244	2352005	Like, I shouldn't have to buy two-player games.
2353299	2353600	You know what?
2353620	2357105	Blaze says they could have packaged Luminous as a real game and no one would be bitching.
2357986	2358166	True.
2358707	2359328	And you know what?
2360316	2361656	I mean, but I don't know.
2361696	2363497	It would have been a little less deceptive in my mind.
2363517	2363777	I don't know.
2363817	2366257	There's a certain element of deception with this whole thing.
2366497	2367878	Maybe I'm being overreactive.
2367958	2368278	I don't know.
2368538	2373579	Well, also, one thing to consider being in the video game industry is the production costs.
2374259	2387842	You know, they would have to not only go through rigorous testing to ensure that all of the content in the game follows Microsoft's strict rules, but also how much it would cost to send and...
2390143	2392825	Make the CDs and the manuals and things like that.
2393225	2394486	Otherwise, you could just buy it online.
2394627	2397809	True, but don't the online games go through a similar process?
2397849	2411399	Maybe it's not as rigid, but the way... Because remember when we had that story a couple weeks back about how Duke Nukem wasn't going to be on Xbox Live anytime soon because it would have to go through a process, and Microsoft supposedly has all these games in a queue waiting to go on the arcade?
2412120	2419085	So maybe there is still a process, but maybe it's less stringent than having to put the manual, do the clamshells, all that stuff.
2419105	2419606	Definitely.
2420046	2424987	So it would definitely cost less to go straight to live.
2425847	2431768	I think the reason why they did it on live to begin with was that so they could, it started off as a microtransactions thing.
2431788	2436629	It was like, oh, we could sell the Madonna skin and we could sell, you know, whatever other artist skins we're going to have.
2436649	2439829	And then it just turned into, hey, let's microtransaction for everything.
2440369	2441650	But there's some interesting perspectives.
2441670	2444150	I know we got an email on this too, so I'll save that for the mailbag.
2444890	2446511	That lends an interesting perspective as well.
2446911	2448671	Well, I'm sure we got more stories about it too.
2450024	2452785	I know there's other stuff this week, but I haven't looked at the show rules, so.
2453105	2454726	Well, good job prepping for tonight.
2454966	2459608	Well, like, for example, the whole Madden training videos thing, where they want you to buy that stuff.
2460168	2469451	I think people are starting to see, oh, microtransactions are working, then everyone's jumping on the bandwagon, but no one's getting it right.
2469811	2479115	It's kind of like one of those things, like back when motion sensing, ooh, motion sensing's cool, let's all release motion sensing stuff now, and
2480464	2480844	DarkSakura.com
2507589	2525924	and this is a feature in the video game Bully that GayGamer.net and another site, I believe it was GameBrink, captured videos of hot boy-on-boy action, basically, that the main character in the game, Jimmy Hopkins, can kiss boys as well as girls in the game.
2526104	2526404	A-boy.
2527342	2533944	There are several, you have to inspect them first and you'll have an action option for Kiss.
2533984	2536185	And they have the same animation as the females.
2536345	2538085	I don't know, I kind of sit back at this and I go...
2549606	2554049	and keep in mind, I'm gay myself, and I'm kind of looking at this going, this is a way bigger deal than it ought to be.
2554429	2562434	You know, I'm just kind of sitting here going, you know, when it was in The Sims, you know, it was just kind of like, okay, you know, hey, you can just do this if you want, or do this if you want.
2562654	2574502	But now it seems to be like, I don't know, like with all these sites reporting on it and all this stuff, I'm just kind of like, you guys are making a big deal out of what shouldn't, you know, it's just, hey, if you want to play the game like this, if you want to try this, you know.
2575791	2577372	Yeah, and Fable, you kind of did that too.
2577993	2581016	I don't know why this is such a... It's dumb, and you know why?
2581116	2586280	Because people are looking... They are... I swear to God, people are just making Rockstar the fucking scapegoat for everything.
2586641	2591105	They are, like, scrutinizing these games to find something wrong so they can go and sue them some more.
2591485	2591945	You know what?
2592025	2602815	But before you go and start doing that, be, you know, warned that they did put this content... You know, they brought it to the attention of the ERSRB when they were giving it a team rating, so you know what?
2603621	2606444	Fuck off, because this is all kosher.
2606464	2609647	People approved this for the teen rating, and that's it.
2609728	2610268	That's the game.
2610348	2610649	Play it.
2610669	2616775	At least he's not bashing skulls in or eating brains or something like that.
2617576	2618997	It's just fucking kissing.
2619057	2619878	That's all it is.
2619978	2620499	You know what?
2620919	2622181	Bicarious people, they're...
2622964	2624685	Tons of them in college and stuff.
2625026	2636695	Who gives a shit about just, you know, a fictional character who's not even real kissing a fictional character who's not even real who happens to be disguised as a male person.
2636775	2641638	I mean, these are, it's like saying, oh, you know, two puppets making out.
2641899	2645241	Oh, but they're male puppets, you know, so that's really wrong.
2646482	2648884	And nobody really cried out about the whole, you know,
2650492	2651293	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2665751	2666511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2689190	2691172	I'm not interested in you I'm interested in her
2706925	2707945	And nobody would have blinked an eye.
2708706	2710046	That's the other weird thing.
2710086	2711087	Nobody would have blinked an eye at that.
2711107	2720050	Because the vast majority, I hate to say it, the vast majority of gamers out there are, well, desperate young men who like to see hot lesbian action.
2720911	2723412	They should just do a game called Hot Lesbian Action.
2723792	2724892	It would sell.
2724972	2726693	It's called Dead or Alive Extreme.
2727353	2728834	Yeah, with independently moving boobs.
2730134	2733736	Where you sit on the other person's back and do... Sorry.
2734594	2735114	Never mind.
2735574	2736235	What were you going to say?
2736555	2740956	I was going to say Vice City Stories actually has one of the main characters is a transsexual.
2742257	2749399	And you don't know who it is, but one of them is a, you know, we learn later on, one of them is a tranny, and they have a major role in the game.
2750019	2755101	So it's like Rockstar's trying to, I don't know, push the boundaries of it.
2756001	2760163	I don't know, it's just, they're just, you know, writing diverse characters into their games.
2760183	2761803	What's wrong with that?
2762544	2763244	It's about time.
2763766	2767229	Hooray for them, even though these kind of aren't the games that really interest me.
2767869	2768390	But here's the thing.
2768530	2770992	I'm not going to go buy Bully just because it has this in it.
2771512	2780199	And I know other people who did, and I'm kind of like, you know it's a game, and this is like five seconds of a game.
2780739	2781079	I don't know.
2781460	2782841	I don't understand why you would go.
2782901	2787044	I mean, maybe they're trying to support the cause or whatever, which, okay, whatever.
2787164	2789246	But you know what, though?
2789386	2790427	I'd go see a movie that had...
2792383	2793504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2814026	2842218	the film studios decided not to so Microsoft has issued a statement we're disappointed that Universal wanted to significantly renegotiate the financial points of the deal but the Halo franchise is hugely popular and our goal remains the same to find a partner that shares our passion and will creatively collaborate with us to best represent the story so it may happen but not anytime soon yeah I think this just means delays development hell yeah seriously oh well
2843326	2843786	You know what?
2843846	2848769	If it takes that much time to get it right, I would much rather see them delay it and get it right.
2849269	2855413	I mean, Halo is a game, so I think the games are what a lot of us are more excited about than the movie.
2855733	2857934	So Hollywood, take your time, just don't fuck it up.
2858494	2859035	Exactly.
2860035	2872502	Some interesting stuff, those rumored from Game Informers, they're saying that they have an insider that's let them know that Halo 3 is going to be getting a demo early next year.
2873730	2901256	and that's pretty much all we know right now is speculation there might be a Halo 3 demo early next year and that would make sense considering the supposed release date of Halo 3 being March or April of next year so yeah, duh but one of the interesting rumors I also read about Halo 3 demos they were saying they might charge for it that was a weird rumor, I read that too
2902318	2909240	I don't know, the only way I could see that being, I mean, well, you know, I guess they kind of already do that.
2909300	2919023	I mean, you can go to like Best Buy, I think, and buy a World of Warcraft 14-day trial for a couple bucks, you know, so I guess charging for demos isn't absolutely unheard of.
2919344	2923925	I think it does make a lot of people go, eh, but if people will pay it,
2924329	2925229	They're going to get away with it.
2925249	2929892	Especially, you know, if it's multiplayer and online demo, there's going to be a lot of people that are down for that.
2929972	2933733	So, you know, they probably do have room to get away with charging for that.
2933754	2935354	So, I don't know.
2935374	2935915	I guess we'll see.
2936715	2937195	What do you think?
2937235	2938556	Would you pay for a Halo 3 demo?
2939836	2940297	Yeah, probably.
2940577	2941457	Depends on how much it is.
2941717	2942198	It would be nice.
2942218	2943878	If it's like five bucks, I'm not paying for that.
2943918	2952643	But, you know, and also, I'm not really a good indicator of whether you'd pay for it or not because I would probably buy just to report on it for the show.
2952783	2953083	Yeah, man.
2953123	2953383	So...
2953999	2957761	You know... Okay, with the gamer in you, the regular gamer, non-journalist in you.
2958022	2958182	No.
2958402	2958702	Okay.
2958762	2961564	I wouldn't pay for it because, you know, to be honest, I never played it.
2961604	2963685	What if it... Now, here's a good idea that might justify that.
2963745	2969469	What if it came with those little pictures or themes or something, came with it, like to maybe sweeten the deal?
2969669	2969849	No.
2970149	2970309	No?
2970849	2971670	No, I wouldn't do that.
2971810	2972590	Here's what I would do.
2973671	2976533	I subscribe to Xbox Magazine, and let me get this straight.
2976953	2981476	Xbox Magazine, they used to come with demos that you couldn't find on Xbox Live.
2981991	2982771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3011205	3012506	Interesting comments from our chatroom.
3012647	3017511	Bandit says they should not charge for the demo, but should charge for the opportunity to play multiplayer in the demo.
3018131	3023356	Well, you know, because servers cost money to maintain, I guess, although no other multiplayer demos have been charged as of yet.
3024637	3024897	Let's see.
3024917	3026438	ShadowNextGen makes it very clear.
3026518	3027599	I'm not paying for a demo.
3028760	3029301	I ain't doing it.
3030281	3030722	Let's see.
3031262	3034505	VidPower says Halo 3 will be microtransactions.
3034845	3036907	Spend 400 points to get the sniper rifle.
3037367	3038028	Oh, I hope not.
3038923	3040625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3059079	3060760	but some people don't, you know.
3060840	3062601	And we're arbitrarily picking a weapon here.
3062621	3067744	We don't mean that that's actually going to happen, but I just hope they use caution in the microtransactions.
3068144	3071366	Maybe learning a little bit from this luminous backlash that's going on, so.
3071606	3072367	What about EA?
3072927	3074368	JeremyTodd1 has a very interesting point.
3074408	3079791	People who don't have their 360 connected to live will find the OXM's demo very useful.
3080071	3086394	Some people that play Halo don't play it on live because it does have a very thorough story mode in it, so something to think about.
3087235	3087335	Hmm.
3088766	3092089	Alright, anyway, one other story about the 360.
3092689	3095432	It's possible that there's going to be a dashboard update this week.
3096144	3102026	Now, this is speculation, but the speculation is coming from something Major Nelson said in his latest podcast.
3102446	3108667	He was talking to a developer on the show, and basically they were talking about the wireless communicator that's coming out very soon.
3108987	3111648	The wireless communicator is scheduled to come out October 31st.
3111968	3118010	Major Nelson said, you know, if you were to go to the store today and buy it, you can't use it until the fall upgrade to the dashboard.
3118390	3123191	Well, then that gets people thinking, okay, so he's saying that if, because this came out last week, this podcast,
3123581	3124982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3141983	3143504	They would need to put it out beforehand.
3143945	3152673	And I think it's about the time to do that anyways, because you're going to want to have the dashboard update ready for the 7th when the HD DVD player comes out.
3152753	3159819	You're going to want to have the update ready for when the PlayStation 3 comes out, so you have that 1080p and you can compete with them.
3160921	3163243	And whatever other fun stuff they want to throw in there.
3163343	3164884	More backwards compatibility, maybe.
3165124	3166866	You know, hey, maybe 2K.
3167093	3167553	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3200960	3218498	Major Nelson seems like a really great guy I've never met him in person I will turn this dashboard update around if you do not behave but if you read those comments on his board and you know it's getting to him because he's had to make some changes I'd be so annoyed too alright, anyway
3218973	3231004	Well, something that may annoy other people in regards to Microsoft is that there's actually indications that they favor the live gold accounts above the platinum ones.
3231024	3232666	Well, over the silver?
3232986	3233466	Over the silver.
3233827	3234267	They should.
3234447	3235108	I'm paying for it.
3236389	3242555	Well, basically, they're saying that, especially for some of the...
3243487	3249089	The demos that are coming out, they're releasing them to the gold accounts before they're releasing them to the silver.
3249689	3258753	So you'll get the newer trailers, the newer demos, instead of having to wait for them because they're releasing them about a week or so afterwards.
3259053	3259453	That's fine.
3259493	3264035	I think that's perfect because it's more incentive to go play on gold.
3266375	3266896	And you know what?
3267056	3267836	Hey, it's free.
3267856	3269917	You can't complain if you're getting demos later on.
3270357	3270557	Just
3271807	3275832	If you're paying $50 for your year subscription, you should be getting your stuff.
3276092	3276533	Exactly.
3276593	3278134	You should have some sort of perks.
3279116	3282039	I'm surprised there hasn't really been much more other than this.
3282860	3290809	If not, then if you've got the silver, if you want them at the same time, they should do some sort of pay-by-download for...
3292461	3296123	I don't think they're going to come out of nowhere and say, surprise, you're going to have to pay for this.
3296143	3297504	They're going to piss more people off with that.
3297524	3300905	I think Sony is in a corner now where they have to make it free.
3320643	3324506	Didn't they have that comparison chart that got them in a lot of trouble?
3324726	3328008	That was comparing the Sony PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360.
3328048	3331510	And it was talking about like, hey, this comes with it.
3332151	3336014	It was basically trying to show the Xbox 360 actually costs more than the PlayStation 3.
3336774	3337635	It was that comparison.
3337675	3339576	And one of the things was they were talking about Play Online.
3339996	3341297	And it was free on PlayStation 3.
3341697	3345580	So I'm pretty sure it's going to be... Well, 15 a month, though, it's not that expensive.
3345640	3347221	You're technically paying about...
3348622	3350004	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3359258	3364700	If you think about it in the big picture, you really are not paying all that much for your subscription cost for live.
3364720	3366340	A couple quick comments in chat.
3366401	3369462	Blaze says, good, if I'm paying $50 a year, I should get it earlier.
3370282	3377564	JeremyTao1 says, I'd rather pay $50 a year for live, which has a lot more neat features than have the free PS3 online service and it having not as many features.
3377944	3379245	So interesting point there as well.
3379265	3379885	Pay for what you get.
3381306	3384367	ShadowNextGen agrees, $50 a year for Xbox Live is a great value.
3384387	3385647	All right.
3386487	3386667	Hmm.
3387588	3388048	Interesting.
3389259	3390059	Spiker, Brute Weapon
3413676	3419802	Spartan Laser that apparently tears vehicles apart, and a nail grenade which sticks in the walls and sends nails everywhere.
3420262	3426508	Brand new vehicles like the Mongoose, which is like a miniature ATV for two passengers with no weapons on it.
3427049	3437659	And then the one that people are hoping is mistranslated, but the Man Cannon, which launches players into the air, kind of like jump pads in Unreal or Quaker Arena.
3438973	3441734	Come step in suit, would you want to see my, uh, man-cannon?
3441954	3442754	Man-cannon.
3442854	3443535	It's not the man-cannon.
3463327	3466748	Some other interesting stuff is it's going to be coming out in three different SKUs.
3467428	3482113	The first one's game only, second one will be a collector's edition, and the third one is the legendary edition, which includes a replica of Master Chief's helmet, which is miniaturizing, so it's about cat size, so you can put it on your cat.
3482473	3483214	Or your man cannon.
3483774	3484334	Or man cannon.
3484976	3491162	It's also going to include documentaries, developer commentary, spin-off material like Red vs. Blue, Spark of Life, etc.
3492263	3496166	And all the cutscenes from Halo 1 through 3 in HD on a separate disc.
3496226	3496907	That's kind of cool.
3497067	3498928	And maybe a sneak peek at the Halo movie.
3498969	3500029	They're just speculating right now.
3500390	3501791	But lots of screenshots.
3501851	3502932	Looks very pretty.
3503312	3504153	Very, very pretty.
3504714	3509698	Of course, also coming out at the same time, not to be outdone by this leaked information...
3510453	3515175	OneUp had to mention that EGM will be also having some content on Halo 3.
3515235	3517116	Hey, hey, buy our magazine too.
3517216	3523238	Which, by the looks of their content, almost identical to what is in that Swedish magazine.
3523978	3526839	And, yeah, so that'll be coming.
3526859	3530001	In fact, they're going to be doing three weeks of coverage for Halo 3.
3532081	3535083	I thought usually you did that leading up to a game's release.
3536543	3538284	This is just randomly, hey, folks...
3538752	3540052	Three weeks of Halo 3 stuff.
3540152	3540392	Yeah.
3540753	3540993	Okay.
3541173	3542633	Well, then... Okay.
3542813	3544874	That's... That's what you want to do.
3545954	3549835	That whole Man Cannon thing reminds me of when we were playing Fear last night.
3550835	3552575	And there's a weapon in there called the Penetrator.
3554016	3558017	So... If that gives you any indication.
3558257	3559577	So... Anyway.
3560297	3560657	Let's see.
3560998	3564738	PooEater says, Okay, so I'm guessing Man Cannon will be the next joke we run into the ground.
3564838	3565219	Most likely.
3565599	3565959	Most likely.
3566779	3566839	Um...
3567475	3573460	DJ Morpheus asks, hello, by the way, to our good buddy DJ Morpheus, honestly, who really looks at the developer extras?
3574741	3575722	I do!
3576863	3577963	It depends on the game.
3578544	3581206	I wouldn't buy this Halo 3 Uber Edition or whatever.
3581226	3582247	That's too much crap.
3582327	3585229	But I know people who love their Halo.
3585449	3587531	I might do that just to put a Halo helmet in my cube.
3589119	3592360	I don't really have a lot of game memorabilia, and that might be kind of fun.
3592480	3593500	I have to see what it looks like.
3593520	3594981	If it looks retarded, I'm not buying it.
3595001	3598422	Well, no, I actually love seeing all of the behind-the-scenes stuff.
3598482	3605224	Being in a design major myself, I love seeing all the artistic elements that go behind it.
3605804	3613927	But when we got the Toy Story box set, I was watching all the rendering errors first, before I was even watching the movies, because I'm just into all that kind of stuff.
3613947	3614607	I think it's great.
3615420	3618943	I like the ones in Shrek where the donkey turns into a big fuzzy porcupine looking thing.
3620063	3624206	Well, I personally wouldn't mind buying the extra stuff.
3624246	3631551	For Company of Heroes, which is an RTS game for the PC, they had just the regular edition and they had the special silver edition.
3631651	3637474	And with the special silver edition, it had a DVD with special features of how they...
3638835	3640636	made the storyline, the people they interviewed.
3640676	3651983	And it even came with little flashcards so that you can see what type of tanks you were fighting and what were some of their names and some of the weak spots and everything.
3652003	3652864	So it was pretty interesting.
3653444	3653684	Huh.
3654605	3654785	All right.
3654965	3657086	For those people who love World War II.
3657287	3662150	I'm getting the collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII so I can watch all the extras that are going to be there.
3662170	3664331	And yes, I probably will watch them because I'm sad.
3669557	3671698	This is another game I believe has a collector's edition.
3671738	3673858	Yes, Gears of War has a collector's edition coming out.
3673998	3676099	All right, well, Gears of War has gone gold-ish.
3676879	3678660	It has gone officially gold, too.
3678780	3679420	Yeah, it's gold.
3680120	3684802	Cliffy B says, my job as designer of Gears of War is, well, more or less done.
3686022	3687903	And that was coming from his official blog.
3687963	3690663	So it does look like Gears of War is going to make it out there on time.
3690723	3695805	Then it was actually, I think, later on that week also, it was also officially gold.
3696604	3700728	I believe Major Nelson kind of dropped that bomb a little later, I think, from what I'm reading.
3700928	3702249	Yeah, they're all ready to go.
3702609	3704150	Yeah, so the game will be out on time.
3704210	3707032	Doesn't look like any delays are going to happen unless something really screws up.
3707153	3711936	But that's exciting, because for the Halo 3 folks, this is a real hold-em-over game.
3712337	3714518	Even for non-Halo people, maybe this is something.
3714538	3715879	It's really cool looking.
3716119	3725327	Yeah, I hope there's a demo on Marketplace so I can check it out, because it looked really cool at E3, but watching and playing are two very, very different things.
3725447	3725907	I'm buying it.
3727573	3729414	Yeah, maybe I'll borrow yours then, check it out first.
3729434	3732776	I do think I won it, though, but, you know, after Final Fantasy XII is beaten.
3734697	3736478	I'm not getting Final Fantasy XII, though.
3736658	3737519	Look, I'm going to say this.
3737639	3738819	I've been a very, very good boy.
3738939	3741360	There is a... I'm okay to say this.
3741380	3746803	There is a pirated copy of Final Fantasy XII sitting on the floor of my living room right now, and I haven't touched it.
3747383	3750525	I'm being good, and I'm being a very good boy.
3750785	3754427	Well, it's kind of on someone else's PlayStation's hard drive, so I can't really give that away.
3754807	3755948	I'm not going to name names, but...
3757250	3757710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3778315	3779916	So I'm tempted to take a camera.
3779936	3781436	Does somebody want to go with me late tomorrow?
3781496	3782937	I'll go with you if you get me a copy.
3783117	3783777	Take a video camera?
3783857	3784017	No.
3784037	3789739	I'm not going to buy you that game after you bashed on it on this program saying you hate the battle system.
3789759	3790699	You can kiss my butt.
3790719	3794880	Actually, actually, actually, actually, there are things about that game that make me want it, but I'm still so busy.
3795460	3796941	I really am getting into PSU now.
3797621	3800342	But you let me make a game on my memory card.
3800482	3800702	All right.
3801181	3801801	So I play over here.
3801821	3805223	GameStuffs have had Final Fantasy XII since like Friday, by the way.
3805263	3808545	Yeah, so did CompUSA, but they put them all out on the shelves from what I hear.
3808605	3810386	But I'm being good and I'm waiting.
3811127	3812788	Does somebody want to come?
3812808	3814449	We could take a video camera and do something for YouTube.
3814569	3815329	I'll go with you.
3815709	3816009	I don't know.
3816029	3817170	I've got to work on Tuesday.
3817450	3817770	We'll see.
3818291	3820712	I do too, but hey, staying up late might be fun.
3821513	3829217	Well, speaking of things, though, that are kind of messed up, you know, they broke a particular Walmart in Arkansas broke street date for Guitar Hero 2.
3830883	3832264	It was actually reported on.
3832865	3842537	So since it's actually supposed to be released on November 7th and Walmart said, uh-uh, we're releasing it now, then maybe your local Walmart will have it.
3843257	3847743	I'm actually sort of thinking about making a run by Walmart just because I have to play Trogdor.
3849945	3850346	If you know...
3851471	3854012	This is kind of a, well, it's a related story.
3854112	3861653	You know you can actually hack the demo to play the songs that were unlocked in the game.
3862293	3863853	Apparently they were on the demo disc.
3864533	3865654	Way to go, programmers!
3866014	3866614	You rock!
3866894	3868334	Keeping that content on disc.
3868754	3870234	This is how hot coffee happens.
3870835	3873775	Anyways, so yeah, apparently you can hack the demo.
3873795	3875735	I've got the demo at my house.
3876916	3878896	I have to see what's what.
3879229	3882833	I am actually passing on Guitar Hero 2 until the 360 version I sold my Guitar Hero today Wow I'm gonna probably get both
3902486	3913451	Well, as much as I really enjoy Red Octane and so forth, I actually really like Guitar Freaks, and that's where my allegiance goes to.
3913471	3914932	It goes to Konami, I'm sorry.
3915712	3916413	Oh, interesting.
3916893	3919534	Actually, I would say you're a little bit in the minority there.
3919574	3921835	A lot of people don't really prefer Guitar Freaks.
3921855	3922015	I think...
3923866	3925706	I think it just depends on your taste in music, too.
3925846	3930207	I mean, would you say you like to listen to that Japanese rock and the stuff that's usually in those games?
3930247	3931568	Oh, definitely.
3931948	3934788	That's probably why you prefer Guitar Freaks in the end.
3934808	3935608	It really is about the music.
3935668	3941990	I would not have been as excited about Guitar Hero 2 if it wasn't that they put bass mode in it, which I always do on Guitar Freaks.
3942490	3943010	Same here.
3943730	3949291	And the good thing, though, that I actually will still prefer Guitar Freaks over Guitar Hero 4 is because I've got Dromania and I've got a controller.
3949871	3952252	So it's all about putting it in session mode.
3953307	3955770	and just go and add it when you've got a group of people.
3956611	3961616	Too bad Keyboard Mania wouldn't link, but that's still... It's not that I dislike Guitar Hero.
3961716	3964699	I really do want to play Guitar Hero 2, but now is just such a bad time.
3964739	3965960	I really hate Christmas.
3966080	3970144	I love it and I hate it because they just avalanche the games on us at this period.
3970164	3971085	To some people, it's Yule.
3971786	3972326	Well, whatever.
3972447	3973067	You know what I mean.
3973207	3974709	Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate.
3976629	3980090	There's just this avalanche of games right now, and I can't play them all.
3980510	3987092	So I might as well just wait for the 360 version, which will have better graphics, widescreen, and maybe some extra songs.
3987132	3987452	Who knows?
3987472	3988052	We'll wait and see.
3988432	3989232	And I'll play it then.
3989372	3990552	You can come play at my house.
3991713	3992533	I will play.
3992593	3993693	Just like I played pinball this week.
3993713	3994753	I forgot to say in my gaming week.
3994793	3995933	I finally got to play one at the table.
3995953	3996794	Play Guns N' Roses.
3996814	3997154	That's right.
3997214	3998594	My, my, my, my show.
3999290	4003651	It was because I hate you, Michelle!
4003751	4005172	I don't hate Christmas.
4005212	4006732	Why are the chatters saying I hate Christmas?
4006752	4008533	I don't hate Christmas.
4008633	4010253	I hate you for saying I hate Christmas.
4010934	4025558	Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, the full track list has been out for a little bit now, including such wonderful tracks as we mentioned, Strong Bad, Trogdor, The Burninator, Homestar Runner, Flash Animation,
4029754	4041118	And if you happen to be a fan of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, you might recognize this band Deathlock as they perform their hit Thunder Horse.
4041539	4050302	And of course Deathlock is from Metalock plus the wonderful, very violent show on Adult Swim.
4050722	4052563	I think they had that on the E3 demo, didn't they?
4053483	4054043	I don't think so.
4054824	4055904	I remembered hearing it.
4056880	4059680	Anyways, some other stuff that they've got coming out.
4060001	4064001	I believe a new Freeze Pops, or another Freeze Pops song on there, Less Talk, More Rock.
4065081	4065742	Yay, Freeze Pop.
4066442	4071102	And some other stuff, and just a bunch of bands I've never heard of.
4071723	4075783	Honest Bob and the Factory to Deals Incentive.
4075943	4080364	Well, these are all, you know, the indie bands that they put in there, too, which is kind of cool.
4080724	4085385	So, yeah, it's pretty cool, and lots of tracks, so definitely worth picking up if you have a guitar.
4085725	4086405	I don't, so I won't.
4087162	4088023	Well, you can buy the bundle.
4089223	4089743	Why would I do that?
4089764	4090724	I just sold back the guitar.
4091284	4093446	I'm waiting for the 360 one.
4093526	4094466	Which is a big mistake.
4094566	4099549	Why did you announce the 360 one before the... Because we'd be so pissed if they announced it after.
4099889	4103431	You would be pissed and I would be pissed and we'd be on this show yelling and bitching.
4104372	4105312	But we'd buy it anyways.
4105553	4106073	Probably.
4107694	4110135	Alright, let's talk about... I almost said Guitar Freaks 2.
4110195	4111056	Guitar Hero 2 is coming out.
4113476	4114157	XBOX 360's Platinum Collection
4124816	4130621	99 Nights, Project Gotham Racing 3, Rumble Roses XX, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and Every Party.
4131502	4136167	Also, another Xbox 360 system is coming out.
4136247	4141171	It's kind of their, you know, they talked about this earlier, they're going to release kind of a reduced bundle in Japan.
4141211	4144555	So that is out this week, Xbox Live Vision making its debut as well.
4145035	4148938	For those of you holding out on the PlayStation 2, lots of fans still about the PS2.
4149018	4152540	In Japan, you can get LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.
4152940	4158844	Also coming out, Slaughter Up Core 9 and Gallop Racer Inbreed.
4159704	4161606	I'll leave it to you to figure out what that is.
4161826	4164167	But I want to point out, this one gives us this bot.
4164608	4168590	Horses with extra holds on their... That's how they translate it, folks.
4169211	4169271	Um...
4171084	4175006	Here it is, I'm looking here at this game, the Slaughter Upcore 9.
4175086	4176927	It looks like it has a go-go dancer on the front there.
4176947	4180529	It's a gambling simulator, so it has a little go-go girl on the front there.
4180809	4183350	Let's see, let me look at the box art here for this Gallop Racer.
4183850	4186612	Yeah, it looks like a, it says it right there on the box.
4186632	4188373	Look at this, here it is, right there in the studio.
4188413	4190894	Gallop Racer inbreed, right there, 10th anniversary.
4192535	4197277	I'm sorry, but is that like, is that kind of like... If you're an inbred horse, you probably are going to gallop everywhere.
4197297	4198758	Mississippi horse!
4200257	4201358	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4225444	4227025	It's a strategy game by Digital Kids.
4227306	4228366	And just look at the box.
4228587	4229507	Look at the box.
4229527	4231108	How could you not love that hamster?
4232590	4233771	I want the love hamster.
4233791	4237333	I'm going to import love hamster.
4237914	4239455	I have dwarf hamsters myself.
4239675	4245720	And if it's anything like real hamsters, then they probably should rename it to hamster inbreeding.
4248522	4250023	Because they multiply like crazy.
4250283	4253846	Now just keep in mind, please keep your love hamsters away from your man cannons, okay?
4254307	4254747	Boys and girls.
4255441	4256121	I appreciate that.
4256582	4260884	Well, my brain is now swimming from love hamsters.
4262465	4268288	Well, anyways, for our UK friends, we've got a number of things coming out.
4268509	4271650	On the first, we have Sam & Max Season 1, Culture Shock for PC.
4273011	4274472	On the third, a number of titles.
4274492	4280395	We have Curious George for PlayStation 2, Desperate Housewives for PC, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories on PSP.
4281016	4282957	On just about everything, Need for Speed, Carbon...
4284005	4293113	Neverwinter Nights 2 on PC, Rule of Rose on PlayStation 2, Scooby-Doo Who's Watching Who on a number of things, and SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the Krusty Krab.
4294315	4294675	Yeah.
4295376	4299880	And Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent coming out on PC.
4300520	4304224	A few things, though, that should be made a mention of.
4305765	4307827	Excuse me if I can never get my voice to work again.
4309551	4336757	I'll go ahead and list some of them for the 6th because there's actually the biggest one coming out will be Phantasy Star Universe coming out on the 6th of November other things to look forward to within the month actually after having played the demo is WWE Smackdown vs. Raw it's actually really good and if you want to beat everybody use Kane okay anyways I don't speak wrestling sorry yeah
4339581	4343724	Well, each week we like to talk about some stuff that you may not have heard yet.
4344385	4350030	And this week, of course, I'm going to start things off with a few date changes and a few price reductions like normal.
4350710	4354053	First off, the Xbox 360 games have dropped in price this week.
4354374	4357877	Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2 dropped down to $49.99, which is good.
4357957	4360659	Battlefield 2 also dropped down to $49.99.
4361680	4365483	NCAA Football 07, which hasn't been out that long, dropped down to $49.99.
4366946	4369147	Burnout Revenge, which was already cheap to begin with, $29.99.
4370187	4374528	I think all Xbox 360 games should drop to $49.99, a more reasonable price, don't you?
4375049	4381431	Well, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, pretty awesome game, dropped down to $39.99, so that's pretty cool.
4381971	4392514	And of course, if you don't have a 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox Madden dropped down $39.99, and the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on PlayStation 2 and Xbox dropped down to $19.99, so not bad.
4395535	4396696	Now some date changes.
4397077	4398178	It's very interesting.
4398198	4402802	A few things you might not have heard yet, including some of the Wii launch titles have been delayed.
4404794	4405815	It's quite interesting.
4406075	4410856	For example, Blazing Angels on the Wii has been delayed to December 6th.
4411977	4418399	Far Cry Instinct's Predator has been delayed to next year, January 16th, which is very interesting.
4419360	4423581	Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Wii has been delayed to December 7th.
4424001	4426802	Call of Duty 3 has also been delayed to December 7th.
4426983	4429583	And Marvel Ultimate Alliance, December 7th.
4429704	4429744	So...
4431144	4434567	Activision, something happened there because all their titles got delayed.
4435689	4444137	If you're looking for Elder Scrolls Oblivion on the PS3, I mentioned it was a launch title, but of course that's the launch window and not launch day.
4444998	4451083	December 12th, it's already starting its move into March, kind of like the 360 version was.
4452385	4452605	Yeah.
4452992	4454573	It's slowly sneaking away.
4454893	4460937	Anyways, some other games, though, you might also be looking forward to, especially not on the PlayStation 3, but on the 360.
4461778	4464059	Fusion Frenzy 2 won't be coming out this year.
4464139	4468662	It's coming out January 16th of next year.
4469422	4472745	Some games also announced Warriors on the PSP.
4472785	4474566	It's coming out December 13th.
4475026	4477988	Silent Hill Origins also been delayed to next year.
4478707	4483392	So you won't be seeing that until at least January 17th.
4483932	4487856	I want to say I read somewhere there's some major reworking going on there, which is why it was delayed.
4487916	4490379	That date has been bouncing around this week like crazy.
4490419	4492261	It was in March at one time this week.
4492441	4493081	It's nuts.
4493582	4501530	One point, though, about that is that if you go in the Akira Yamaoka community on LiveJournal, there's actually previews to some of the tracks in the game.
4502511	4502591	Okay.
4504067	4510630	And then finally, two other titles were announced from Buena Vista Interactive that you haven't heard about yet on systems.
4510910	4513451	Pirates of the Caribbean 3, of course, that's a working title.
4514292	4522335	It's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3, the Wii, Xbox 360, DS, and PSP May 16th of next year.
4522955	4525216	And, God, why are they making this game?
4525416	4531799	High School Musical The Game is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and the DS on July 11th.
4532827	4536470	So those are your dates for the week for exclusive stuff.
4537030	4543436	Real quickly, Footy Monsters, Diane in chat here wants to know, you know the release date for Splinter Cell Double Agent on PS2?
4545557	4546578	Splinter Cell Double Agent?
4547199	4548080	For the US?
4548300	4548760	PS2, yeah.
4549501	4552543	That was actually last week.
4552583	4552763	For PS2?
4553104	4555085	Yeah, it came out a week after the 360.
4556166	4557127	So that was last week.
4558860	4565263	Anywho, um, some other stuff, of course, you know, the releases for this week, um, we've got lots of big stuff.
4565303	4571965	I mean, this is kind of getting into the whole, um, you know, kind of end of the year push.
4572546	4578388	Um, Need for Speed Carbon on pretty much every single system out there except for the PlayStation 3 and Wii, because those are coming out a little bit later.
4579148	4585531	Um, of course, you've got Children of Mana on the DS, Pokemon Ranger on the DS, um,
4587022	4593945	Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII
4612172	4622883	Death Junior, Root of Evil, Killzone Liberation, Mind Quiz, and Power Stone Collection.
4623224	4627928	So that's a little slice of the stuff coming out.
4628048	4628889	Not everything, of course.
4629350	4629610	Yeah.
4629944	4642076	As far as things coming out much later, it was actually listed in the official Xbox 360 magazine that Bethesda is working on a game that uses the Unreal Engine 3 called Rogue Warrior.
4642296	4644678	It's also going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 3.
4646881	4649603	It's a multiplayer anti-terrorism game.
4649683	4652586	It's actually based on books by Richard Marcinko.
4652606	4653447	I think that's how it's pronounced.
4654565	4656347	and being developed by Zombie Studios.
4656647	4658488	They worked on Shadow Ops prior.
4659349	4667714	It's supposed to have some different modes, including one that generates a map based on what the teams decide on beforehand, like a cooperative map.
4669476	4672898	And you're the only one who will know the territory you start off in.
4673759	4678662	It also has a four-player co-op mode, 24 and other multiplayer modes.
4680363	4681544	Sounds pretty cool, actually.
4683895	4685957	if you like, you know, those types of games.
4686497	4686797	All right.
4687678	4689319	Well, we have a... I like Bethesda.
4689980	4690860	Yeah, I like Bethesda, too.
4691361	4694203	We have a series of oopsie things to report.
4694223	4695284	There's been a lot of oopsies.
4695604	4699027	Remember last week, the big, big oopsie with Bubble Bobble on the DS?
4699307	4699527	Oopsie.
4699567	4700588	And you can't get past stage 30?
4701108	4704771	Okay, well, nothing quite that major, but a couple big oopsies nonetheless.
4705251	4711376	Somebody noticed just now that, I believe this was on NeoGAF, those big forums over there,
4712118	4722562	Notice that the GameCube Killer7 box, if you look at the back, it points you to a website, www.killer7.com.
4723283	4725784	Killer7.com is a porno site.
4725844	4730326	The correct site should have been killer-7.com.
4730626	4732867	Are you going to killer7.com right now, Loki?
4733247	4733787	No, I'm not.
4734908	4737028	Someone is sending me a private message.
4737369	4739329	Because I saw him reach for the keyboard as I said that.
4739369	4740830	I thought he was going to check that out right now.
4741394	4747317	Well, certainly a lot of free publicity for that porno site this week, thanks to Capcom's proofreading team.
4747357	4748498	Good job, Capcom.
4749838	4761264	Anyway, some other funny oopsies have been going on, like in Glasgow, because apparently Wii's out over there, according to some of their clocks, which have been incorrectly set up.
4761664	4766147	It's their countdown clocks that they have for the Wii, and so now it's just saying out now.
4766467	4769668	But, I don't know, big deal.
4769868	4770969	So someone messed up a clock.
4772395	4778509	Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing to put on the internet, you know, like, hey, somebody can't set a clock, that's gaming news.
4780014	4783675	But I guess some folks are curious what it's going to look like when all is said and done.
4784495	4787395	A couple website oopsies going on right now.
4787776	4791436	Walmart was listing the PlayStation 3 for $299.82.
4791696	4802098	Keep in mind the PlayStation 3 is supposed to cost at least $4.99 for the low one, $5.99 for the high one.
4802258	4805659	Well, you know they do sell a lot of stuff as lost leaders.
4805799	4808280	Yeah, but I don't think it's supposed to be that low.
4808340	4809580	I think someone made a boo-boo.
4810480	4811581	Rolling back prices.
4811861	4814142	That sounds like the Xbox 360 price right there.
4815822	4814142	$299.82.
4816763	4818604	Also, a late-breaking oopsie.
4818784	4821345	We got posted to our forums just before the show, I believe.
4821485	4822645	TigerClaw pointed this out.
4823286	4827187	CompUSA was listing a Nintendo Wii for $1,100.
4828528	4831309	And I thought the Wii was supposed to be the affordable system.
4832649	4833430	Must be Canadian.
4834270	4836451	Needless to say, someone's getting fired!
4838412	4838672	All right.
4839795	4841856	Maybe we should make this oopsie thing a regular segment.
4841876	4843897	There certainly are enough mistakes going on out there.
4843957	4845818	I don't know what to say about that.
4847618	4849259	Apparently the Wii thing is still up.
4849319	4851180	Tiger Claws posted a link in our chat right now.
4851200	4856682	Let me go ahead and do that and I'll paste that in right now.
4856722	4858163	I know this is wonderful radio here.
4861024	4861664	Oh yeah, there it is.
4862145	4862845	Wii console, $1,119.06.
4862905	4864385	Someone made a little bit of a mistake there.
4869636	4870597	Good job, CompUSA.
4871038	4877106	Leaking games early, selling Wii's for... That's gotta be one hell of a Wii.
4878088	4880752	It better, like, have other Wii attachments with it.
4881493	4882574	Like the Madden Cannon.
4883575	4884417	And the Penetrator.
4885158	4885919	And the Love Hamster?
4888411	4897496	Every week, DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and all around, and she finds a website appropriate to share with y'all.
4897776	4898356	Appropriate.
4898496	4902098	And she calls, or maybe, is it Killer7.com, your website of the week this week?
4902318	4902538	No.
4902679	4902999	Okay.
4903519	4907101	And she's got a website of the week, and she's going to share it with you right now.
4911303	4916686	Today's website of the week is The Misadventures of Hello Cthulhu.
4917938	4927483	It's a really messed up little webcomic that one of my friends in the Doctor Who fandom linked to me that's about Cthulhu being dropped in the Hello Kitty universe.
4928364	4934447	Yes, the Elder God Cthulhu in the Hello Kitty universe with ribbons on his tentacles.
4935487	4944572	It's very funny and I recommend everybody go read it all the way through because trust me, it sort of has continuity but not really because it's just messed up.
4944612	4947034	Especially when he turns...
4948567	4950288	I haven't seen Bats Maru yet.
4950308	4951269	I've seen Pom Pom Purin.
4951369	4955592	And I've also seen the Tentacle Monster version of Pom Pom Purin 2.
4978092	4982555	My favorite part is when they go to the island and are attacked by the cheese grater monster.
4984316	4985156	It's really random.
4985196	4990059	If you liked Kawaii Knot, Hello Cthulhu is even worse.
4993261	5001705	Hey, before we get to the next story, I want to point out that NintendoManiac64 in our chat room noticed that that amount that they were charging for the Wii on CompUSA, $1,119, is the release date of the Wii, 11-19.
5001745	5001945	Good job.
5001965	5002165	Good eyes.
5007338	5011161	So somebody just screwed up when putting things in their database and put the date where the price goes.
5012042	5012322	Oops!
5012842	5015324	And caused panic amongst game bloggers everywhere.
5015565	5016005	What can you do?
5017546	5021509	Well, there is a little bit more news that I have for everybody.
5021670	5027394	Something that may interest somebody in the room, except I think she already knows about it, is the LocoRoco Halloween demo.
5028795	5032218	It also comes with a firmware update for the PSP, bringing it to 2.82.
5032258	5032478	Excuse me.
5032498	5032538	Um...
5037768	5049796	Basically, according to our expert friends at Sony, who, again, expert is used very loosely, it has the extras, things that are changed.
5049816	5051157	We think we've covered all this before.
5051757	5055980	But you don't really need it to play the LocoRoco demo.
5056440	5058361	You can still play it with 2.71 firmware.
5058381	5058581	Okay.
5062697	5069419	For European gamers, you can download the firmware update from yourpsp.com or you can also use the US one.
5069439	5070139	It doesn't really matter.
5070960	5073180	The LocoRoco demo is available online.
5073781	5075681	It also has a US and European version.
5076041	5078442	I wonder if anyone's going to dress up as a LocoRoco for Halloween.
5078462	5079343	That would be kind of cute.
5079403	5079743	I'm not.
5079783	5080783	I'm going to be a pirate.
5081083	5082584	I don't have a costume picked out yet.
5082744	5085164	I never pick out my costume until the day of Halloween, actually.
5086165	5087345	I've got this long wig.
5088686	5089526	I'm going to be a pirate.
5089766	5089866	Arr.
5090566	5093010	Okay, by the way, I made a mistake.
5093430	5098297	It was actually Blackboy who noticed it first that the CompUSA screw-up.
5098838	5101923	Nintendo Maniac was just the first to type it in all caps, so I saw it.
5103064	5105648	Not to encourage you all in chat to type in all caps, damn you.
5106855	5113319	Alright, it's getting towards the end of this segment, so that means it's time to hear a little bit of new DDR music.
5113739	5127147	And for the past eight weeks, if you can believe it, we've been premiering new songs from Dance Dance Revolution Universe, which will be coming out on the Xbox 360, sounds like next year, and DDR Ultramix 4, which I believe is next month?
5127847	5128468	It's in November?
5129028	5129948	I believe is when it's coming out?
5130469	5130869	Right, Loki?
5131900	5133261	Ultramix 4 is in November still?
5133421	5136182	Yes, Ultramix 4 is November 15th.
5136262	5136742	Last we heard.
5136762	5139143	I think the bundle's delayed a week, which is weird.
5139163	5140444	They did the same thing with Supernova.
5140584	5141124	I don't know why.
5142045	5142265	Maybe.
5142405	5143325	Can't make the pads.
5143625	5148608	All right, well, anyway, we have some new songs for you guys, so you can check out some of the songs you'll be able to dance to in these new games.
5148988	5152830	We're going to start off this last batch of songs with a song from DDR Universe.
5153310	5159573	It's a group called Geomancer, and the song is called Hydrasound, and it's going to start off our previews tonight.
5160054	5161316	Here on Orange Lounge Radio
5175169	5175649	and many more.
5208696	5209380	Thanks for watching!
5256129	5263752	And that was Hydrasound by Geomancer here on the DDR Sneak Peeks on Orange Lounge Radio, coming soon to DDR Universe.
5263812	5265132	All right, let's go into our next song.
5265593	5267193	It's from DDR Ultramix 4.
5267333	5273056	It's by an artist called Steve Porter, and the song is called Sockham, and it's coming to DDR Ultramix 4.

5729811	5731512	Love this feeling that they did previously.
5731632	5734494	So, you know, I know it was kind of a controversial song in the community.
