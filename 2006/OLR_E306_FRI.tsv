14133	18922	We are live at the E3 Outpost for this Friday, 2006 E3 edition.
32330	36092	Welcome, everybody, to the Friday edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
36192	43377	We are here live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles, where we've been taping our post-E3 shows all week long.
44157	45058	My name is Rob Roberts.
45078	46158	You might know me as Sky.
46239	49460	Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49561	50181	Yo, what up?
51342	52883	And, of course, TechMassaLoki.
53283	53503	Hello.
53523	54243	All right.
54584	58246	And moseying his way on over to a microphone there, joining us for...
59929	67554	This last of our E3 shows is the one and only Bobby Blackwool, who has no microphone right now.
68014	68454	That's all right.
69295	71216	We have mic troubles.
71236	71696	That's all right.
71736	72677	Live radio, boys and girls.
74438	75719	I think... It's coming.
75759	76319	There you go.
76379	76779	There you are.
76839	77240	That's all right.
77640	82183	And of course, once again, wave hello to producer Lawrence Young, who's over there in the corner.
83063	85005	God, I wish we could take him back to Sacramento with us.
85065	86165	He's been awesome all week long.
86706	87006	All right.
88038	90019	We have some Smash Brothers still going on.
111007	112148	Mario Kart Double Dash.
112408	115351	I would think people would be sick of games by the end of this show.
115591	116272	Fight Night Round 3.
117013	119675	I think we even had Rampage Total Destruction.
119755	120276	Oh, awesome.
120476	122578	They have black going on on one of the TVs over there.
122838	123238	Sweet.
124620	128323	I don't know about you guys, but I think I might be sick of games after today.
128383	128964	No, I'm kidding.
129324	131946	You know I'll go right back home and play games again, but boy, overload.
132006	133688	I was going to say, do you have a fever?
133708	134829	Are you feeling okay?
135209	135410	No.
136218	136998	No, it's great.
137018	138379	It's just, you know, it's exhausting.
138399	145081	And I know a lot of people sitting at home are probably screaming at me going, Sky, you ungrateful bastard, at least you get to go to E3.
145501	148142	Okay, yeah, trust me, I don't take that for granted.
148162	150943	I'm very lucky to be able to go, but it is very tiring.
150963	153523	And if you were here, you'd say the same thing as like, shit, I'm exhausted.
153624	160666	You know, I'm craving some Ridge Racer 6 since they didn't have Ridge Racer 7 at PlayStation or Namco's booth this year, except for a video.
160886	162046	I know, kind of disappointing, huh?
162706	164067	I don't know why I'm craving it, it's just...
164867	165447	Need to play it.
165467	166348	The Craven is there.
166388	166908	The Itch is there.
167168	168028	I'm craving tacos.
168528	172190	Quick programming note, you guys, for you Orange Lounge Radio fans.
172210	176191	There will be no live program this Sunday, which is Mother's Day.
176892	181033	So spend some extra time with your mother or motherly figure in your life.
181613	183054	The politically correct term there.
183334	201146	or catch up on the three podcasts that we had there you go unfortunately we've just we got other stuff going on due to the holiday and you know just the fact that we're driving home from E3 and all that so we hope our listeners will understand but we'll be back of course our normal time next Sunday we're just burnt out from the week
202086	202607	A little wee?
202887	203267	A little bit.
203327	205989	I plan on playing that new game, Extreme Nap Action.
207330	207610	All right.
208450	213354	I'm going to the chat room there over at www... I'm sorry, chat.allgames.com tonight.
213394	214575	I'm so used to plugging the other room.
215095	217817	Tonight, we're chat.allgames.com.
217937	221339	Next week, we'll be back to the Orange Lounge Radio chat over at orangeloungeradio.com.
221359	223721	You can always interact with us on our forums over there as well.
224421	225942	Reading chat right now, let's see.
226062	230025	Jada2006 says, LOL, there are so many video games.
230385	231426	How can you get sick of them?
232447	233267	Exactly.
233287	235909	Get back and read the first part of your sentence and then ask that again.
236790	243275	With so many video games comes so much walking and so many lines, including those for food.
243395	245857	So, sorry to tell you.
246117	246617	You know what?
246878	247078	What?
247158	249620	I actually didn't have a really long line for food.
250871	251572	It was much better this year.
251592	252233	It was only for coffee.
252613	253875	I will hand it off to the expo.
253895	256438	They did a much better job with food this year than last year.
256598	258160	I think that was because of the Wii line.
258641	259502	And everybody was in that.
259782	263527	The long lines were for the grill and everything.
263547	264888	And I'm like, sandwich tuna.
265709	267532	They had much more... Excuse me.
268749	273012	They have much more stuff set up outside this year, which I thought was smart.
273053	276615	They had like the barbecue grills, like you were kind of saying, and all that stuff.
276976	279438	And I think people started bringing food too, which is also smart.
279458	281279	They had some really healthy selections this time around.
281299	284081	I was very pleased because, you know, I don't do the meat thing.
284101	285182	They had tuna.
285743	286203	Good to hear it.
286403	288765	They had bagels and coffee.
289486	291688	Lots of coffee for me this weekend, this week.
293379	298263	Let's go around and play two interesting things tonight, because we have other topics we want to get to, so we can't do three.
298283	299804	We're going to do two interesting things tonight.
300284	303106	DarkSakura, two interesting things you saw at the show today.
303246	303847	Start with one.
304507	310331	You know, I had it in my head, and it was in that issue of EGM I'd been reading down there, and I completely forgot what it was.
311072	317476	So I'm going to say X Steel by NCSoft.
318877	320298	That was very, very interesting.
320358	321539	It's like virtual on.
322458	326101	But a lot more, and it's going to be a free game.
326421	328523	A free download, free game through PlayNC.
328683	329303	I like free.
329544	330925	My ears perk up when I hear free.
330985	332546	They had a whole series of games.
332606	335828	Dungeon Runner, there was Smash Star, which they're going to rename.
335868	336829	It's already out in Korea.
338050	341473	And Soccer Fury, which was very, very detailed.
341533	343995	It was like hardcore, beat everyone up soccer.
346840	347361	Very cool.
347441	348742	So you can't beat the price of free.
348943	350985	How did you enjoy the tour over there at that booth?
351346	352507	It was pretty cool.
352667	355491	The Guild Wars woman was actually sort of like, maybe I should play Guild Wars.
355511	358074	Yeah, because you've bashed Guild Wars on this show before.
358094	362019	Not necessarily bashed, it just wasn't fun for me when I played it before.
362760	365804	But actually better than that, I'm actually considering trying Tabula Rasa.
366570	367030	Very cool.
367110	371893	Because I like the whole sci-fi, kill aliens, shoot things fun.
373034	375776	Guild Wars fans will be happy to hear the new expansions winning people over.
376656	378537	Loki, we're playing two interesting things.
378637	379478	What's one of your two?
380118	383601	Oh man, you know, I've been so lazy today.
383641	386943	I know I played a lot of things today, but I don't remember half the stuff I played.
387603	388003	God.
388864	389144	God.
390532	395135	If you want to cheat, tell them something from Wednesday or Thursday that we haven't talked about yet and they won't know the difference.
395455	395916	I guess.
399118	401559	I played... What was it?
403120	404001	Okay, Spore.
404101	405942	Spore was huge.
406422	407943	It was just an awesome looking game.
409765	410945	Not really much more I can say.
410985	415889	If you watch the Game Developers Conference video of it, it's basically that.
415969	418590	It's one of those games where...
419751	423574	I'm just going to sit there and destroy everything.
424194	429117	Create a race of vicious aliens that go and just decimate everything.
429678	430578	That's what I'm doing with Spore.
431319	432940	I loved Spore.
433420	433841	Loved it.
434061	435662	I mean, I was surprised.
435762	439644	I didn't know much about it going into the show today.
439724	442026	I know there's a lot of buzz, but I'm only one guy.
442066	443427	I can't follow everything.
443807	445809	So I wanted to go see it because of the buzz.
449531	450051	We won't go there.
450632	458796	We finally got into the Spore thing, and it was much more than anyone could possibly expect.
459217	470703	If you haven't been following this game, there is so much to it, and so much of it has to do with the user, the way you build things, and the way people that you know and random strangers in the universe build things.
471083	473305	It is so phenomenally impressive.
473365	475846	This is going to be the next Sims, honestly.
476687	477547	Which is not surprising.
477567	478688	I mean, it's Will Wright, but...
480229	481670	It's incredible.
482230	487252	I would be very interested to see if something like this comes out on a console, too, because I know right now it's only PC, right?
487592	495515	It's just PC, but... They're saying DS and PSP as well, but... There was a job posting about porting Spore to the DS.
495715	497055	That's kind of weird.
498876	501197	I think it would be a bastardized version, though, like those Sims.
501317	506158	It should really be on the 360, or something that's really connected to the internet all the time.
506939	507159	Wow.
508927	509308	The Wii.
509468	509908	There you go.
511229	514632	Bobby, what's one of two interesting things you saw today at E3?
515373	521999	This is going to be a surprising one because I'm like sitting here, you know, Nintendo fanboy and stuff and, you know, really bashing on Sony.
523440	526603	Interesting that I actually enjoyed Warhawk.
527403	527703	Really?
527904	532648	I actually played it all ready to be able to be all bashing it and all that stuff.
533168	533909	I was having fun.
534609	535830	What exactly was the demo like?
535870	536750	What did you do in the demo?
537210	538931	There was a single player and a multiplayer demo.
539371	542432	But I did the single player demo just because it was near the end of the show.
544033	548595	Essentially, you just flew around shooting planes and then you had to shoot down four frigates.
549975	552016	The control scheme, it was no different.
552356	554717	For the people who are listening to radio, you can't see me doing this.
555517	560099	If you've ever made a plane with your hand and just flown around and made the noise, we all did that as kids.
560699	562100	That's what it felt like I was doing.
562140	564500	That's how I was flying the plane.
564520	570242	It's nothing innovative or new, but it was fun.
570582	577445	The graphics probably could have been better a little bit, but the game was fun and I was not expecting that going into it.
579451	580272	That's great.
580312	584855	The lines for Warhawk, when I wanted to try and see it, were really, really long, so I didn't really get a chance to do it.
584955	588257	Yeah, I waited until the end of the last day, and there was like two people in front of me.
588317	591900	I have to ask, the controller, how did that feel?
592040	594141	How was that, that tilt controller?
594421	595482	It was fine.
595502	600545	It was very responsive on the movements for the plane, and it felt light.
601126	603708	It's a little light controller, and it felt fine.
604188	606129	It's just got some accelerometers in it.
606149	607150	That's all that it's really got.
607570	608571	Interesting.
609352	620763	Um, okay, uh, one interesting thing I saw today, or I should say one interesting experience was, thanks to a listener of Orange Lounge Radio, I got to cut the Wii line.
621563	622044	Woohoo!
622644	623485	Wii!
623645	625247	Wii, exactly, that's why I said Wii!
625627	626748	So, Justin...
627529	642797	from Vegas, if you're out there listening, I owe you my first born, except I don't have a uterus, so I don't know how it's gonna work, but I owe you so big, thank you so much, I mean, it was totally like a chance thing, we literally ran into each other, and he's like, I'm gonna go see the Wii, and I think I get to cut in line, you wanna come with me?
642837	643878	I'm like, fuck yeah!
644298	650042	So we went over, and sure enough, he talked to his person, Strange Scott Pohl, we were able to go in there, I was very happy.
650422	671618	The downside to that is, is that once you get in there, it's still a bitch to actually get to play any of the demos, so we just got to cut that four hour line to wait to get in there, so we didn't really get to, we still had to wait in the lines once we got in there to play stuff, so I will say, I thought, well, I guess that whole experience is interesting, but while I have the Wii brought up, this is what I played, I played Excite Truck,
672679	675240	which I thought was more fun than it looked in the preview.
675720	676761	I thought it was a fun time.
677301	681863	The graphics are nothing to scream at, but I mean, all the games are widescreen, which made me very happy.
681983	682983	So, you know, that's good.
683183	685384	It's a step up for Nintendo.
685644	688406	Also, WarioWare, which was great.
688846	693388	It's a little tough at first because you have to keep changing the controller's positions, but you get used to it.
693748	695889	And I thought it was really cute.
696449	700891	And I played the tennis thing as well, which I sucked at just in...
701551	703153	I had to be back somewhere else.
711243	715684	That's too bad, that was actually the only one I had any interest in playing and I got right up there, it was great.
715764	716925	Lucky you, lucky you.
717245	723767	Well, I got right up there too, but I had a guy help me get up there too, so we had the same experience on that one.
725468	734251	Alright, let's do one more interesting thing and then we'll get into some of the best and worst of E3, like best booth, best games, all that good stuff.
734631	735911	DarkSakura, one more interesting thing.
736131	737472	I saw something that made me cry.
737932	738212	Okay.
739875	764088	That Bomberman Zero thing Ah, Bomberman Zero That was awful I mean, yeah, it plays like Bomberman But it's too hardcore looking And Bomberman's supposed to be cute I remember seeing those old Hudson Japanese commercials Where the person dressed up in the giant Bomberman suit Running all over the place Being chased by the person in the other suit Did you play the Bomberman game on the Wii?
765269	768551	No, I didn't get to They had that thing tucked away in the corner
770299	771901	E3 Elite Beat Agent
793220	794941	Crazy-ass storylines.
795161	797042	This topic came up on Bobby's show earlier.
797102	800904	For those that have no idea what the F this game is, what is this all about?
801984	805866	Well, originally it came out as, I think, Oiden in Japan.
806627	818212	And from what I gathered, because I wasn't quite paying attention to the storyline, trying to figure out how to play, there's these three guys that just come and basically fix situations.
818272	819073	Like, there's this guy...
820734	825776	This girl, the babysitter, who was trying to ask her boyfriend to go study with her.
826876	828877	Then the mom comes and makes her babysit.
829637	834258	So the elite beat agents come to entertain the children to get them to go to bed.
834979	838180	And so it's got like this art style and kind of a storyline like...
839840	840040	All right.
840060	840200	Awesome.
867159	869760	Joining us, taking Bobby's place momentarily.
869860	871341	Nobody can take Bobby's place.
872361	873282	Well, maybe two of me.
874282	875743	Oh, no, no.
875783	882165	We love Bobby, but he just did a live show from the Outpost, which you can check out at allgames.com.
882865	884246	They're rebroadcasting on Sunday, right?
884286	885787	I'm sure.
885807	888608	Your show will rebroadcast on Sunday, or will you be doing another show?
889537	891158	He's not going to do another show.
891418	891658	No.
892338	893178	He's done for the week.
893238	894379	He's got a mom he's got to visit.
894479	894999	There you go.
895419	900962	So say hello to Scott Rubin, who's joining us from All Games Interactive, which airs here on All Games.
901682	905823	Some of you guys might know Scott from his days at G4 Television.
905903	906224	Yeah.
906464	908785	And you were on a show there, G4TV.com.
908885	909105	Right.
909245	912366	The show named after a website named after a TV show.
912546	912946	Yeah.
913006	914107	Named after a TV network.
914127	914227	Yeah.
914887	919171	The brilliant genius mind behind that was actually the CEO of the network.
919772	929421	I wanted to call it All Game something, and he was like, no, why don't we name it after the website so that we can promote the website on the show.
929661	930762	No hard feelings though, right?
930942	931182	None.
931303	931523	None.
931863	946574	I actually saw him, I was at E3 on Thursday, sitting at the Sony booth, getting ready to come here, and one of the sales guys from G4 saw me and said, hey, by the way, I just want to let you know, Charles is nearby, Charles Hirshhorn, the guy that...
947310	956454	and Charles, you know, whatever, he got the network up, but he kind of ruined a lot of the fun, creative stuff that people wanted to do, so it was a very awkward moment, I thought I'd share that with you.
956474	965017	Yeah, I'll say it, since I don't know if you, I'll say it, G4 went totally down the toilet, I mean, we get guys, what is that?
966218	973301	We get guys is a slogan that used to be the main slogan for West Hollywood here in California.
974594	977598	And they still get guys, so G4 is hoping that some of that will rub off.
977718	979541	Oh, well, more power to them.
979601	980042	I don't know.
980402	980883	We'll see.
981423	986831	But as a gay guy who's been to West Hollywood, I'll say still not interested.
987051	987972	Still not interested.
988593	990736	They can't even win over the gays, so sorry.
992200	997585	Anyway, seriously though, Scott, we've been playing a game here, Interesting Things You Saw at E3.
997825	999867	What was one interesting thing you saw at E3 today?
1000007	1001288	Interesting thing I saw at E3?
1001328	1004971	Interesting can be a game, it can be something you saw, anything.
1005491	1008094	Well, I'll tell you, it is an interesting thing I see at every E3.
1008134	1009835	I don't know if this is going to sound mean.
1009875	1013838	I don't mean to make it sound mean, but it seems like if you're...
1015083	1018205	Paralyzed or quadriplegic, you get into E3.
1018705	1022387	I see lots of people in wheelchairs that are not moving a lot.
1022947	1025589	They have almost no use of their arms and legs.
1026189	1031952	I don't believe they work for retailers or the media, but somehow they seem to get in.
1032012	1034874	Some of them even look very young under the 18 age limit.
1035014	1037155	But see, now that could be like a make-a-wish thing.
1037195	1038535	Yeah, no, I agree.
1038575	1039915	No, I just, you said something.
1040175	1041316	Okay, it is interesting.
1041396	1043716	It's an interesting commentary.
1044856	1046657	And I don't, obviously, I'm not saying anything about it.
1046697	1064161	In fact, some of my favorite moments have been at E3, especially when I was on the air at G4, where I would be approached by a family, reeling a family member, and they would say to us that he watches the show all the time, he's a really big fan, and
1064441	1064761	and many more.
1083434	1086416	You could be anyone, literally, when you play games.
1086436	1095382	So it's always nice to see people who love games and can get a chance to kind of get close to the industry like that and see how they experience it.
1095402	1098064	Because it is, I mean, you guys have been to E3 before.
1098704	1101006	So, you know, you kind of take it for granted after a while.
1101026	1101486	Right, right.
1101686	1102747	But it is fascinating.
1102787	1109331	I mean, I watched a couple of people come in just the past couple of days and their eyes light up as if they've entered Disneyland.
1109351	1110372	Oh, that was me the first year.
1110512	1112754	I don't know, DarkSakura, was that you the first year?
1113635	1120481	I had sort of an idea of what to expect because my friend, who's another GameStop manager, he brings us a video every year.
1121562	1128589	So I sort of had an idea of what to expect, but my first time going and seeing everything so big, I was like, where to first?
1128749	1130971	Yeah, it was overwhelming the first year.
1130991	1131492	Which meant that...
1131972	1133473	Camping out at Konami for two hours.
1133513	1134414	You've got to have a plan.
1134614	1135235	I found that.
1135255	1136076	You've got to have a plan.
1136096	1137437	You've got to have comfortable shoes.
1137777	1138197	Amen.
1138598	1140359	And, you know, you've really got to have a plan.
1140399	1143742	Now, I have not been a part of your live broadcast before.
1145584	1147565	Sky refusing to look at chat.
1147585	1150248	He refuses to acknowledge the people in the chat room.
1150268	1151088	Oh, no, they're there.
1151248	1153170	I mean, they're just not saying anything interesting.
1153410	1156313	And, Loki, you also, you don't even bring chat up.
1156993	1157654	No.
1157774	1158455	Loki doesn't even.
1158736	1159396	Usually I do.
1159517	1160438	Loki hates the chatters.
1160498	1161879	He hates the chatters.
1161919	1164463	That's not quite an actual Wonder Woman outfit.
1165083	1166645	That's not a Wonder Woman outfit?
1166946	1168768	Well, no, because that's a bikini.
1169436	1170197	Oh, you know something?
1170217	1170717	You're right.
1170757	1172958	That could be the reason behind it all.
1173038	1174279	Yeah, that's why she got kicked out.
1174799	1177820	Wonder Woman had a full... Right, right.
1178361	1179641	There you go.
1179681	1181322	Okay, you want to know why I'm not reading chat?
1181342	1182262	Here's a comment right now.
1182523	1184003	Who said Tommy Tallarico?
1184283	1186625	I think somebody's very confused about who's on the show right now.
1186665	1187225	I have no idea.
1187365	1188846	That's why I'm not reading chat.
1188866	1191867	All right, well, you've actually got a good point there.
1191907	1192327	Now, what is this?
1192467	1194368	Paris Hilton doesn't know the name of her own game?
1194909	1195529	Loki, what is this?
1195609	1196470	Diamond Quest Diamond Quest
1215570	1216811	Yeah.
1216911	1218192	Who's expecting her to have a brain?
1219513	1224636	It's like, gee, I don't even know what my game is called despite the fact that it's written right behind her.
1224716	1226117	Yeah, it's on the wall behind her.
1226137	1227078	You're assuming she can read.
1227158	1228819	It's also got her name in it.
1228939	1233162	So she went from calling it Paris Hilton's Jewel Gym to just Diamond Quest.
1234045	1240534	Yeah, well, you know, that's what happens when you hire a dumb, blonde, millionaire, billionaire to promote your game.
1240574	1246923	You need to have someone poor and usually a gamer if you want them to actually give credibility to your game.
1248593	1251556	I'm going to go ahead and try to wrap up the two interesting things game.
1251636	1255320	One more interesting thing I saw today, and boy, so much to see.
1255360	1257121	What else would I say would be one more interesting thing?
1258142	1263948	Probably the use of Pac-Man arcade machines to put the cell phone game in.
1264488	1269850	I thought it was a very interesting use of, it's almost vandalizing a classic piece of machinery.
1269890	1271931	But I suppose it's Namco, they can do what they want with it.
1272311	1276853	But as somebody who used to be a huge pinball fan, I will give Namco this.
1276953	1279094	I thought the Baby Pac-Man machine being there.
1279274	1282716	Because you know Baby Pac-Man was the Pac-Man game that was half Pac-Man, half pinball.
1283356	1285417	There will be pictures going up on our side of this machine.
1285737	1286878	DarkSakura loves this too.
1286998	1289920	I've never got a chance to go back over there and make an offer on it.
1290100	1306052	We've been co-hunting for like a, she'll actually be able to afford it, but I've been secretly wanting a Baby Pac-Man machine for forever, so it was kind of weird to see one there, but you couldn't play it because they were advertising the Baby Pac-Man cell phone game on it.
1306192	1309194	It actually wasn't even Baby Pac-Man, it was just Pac-Man Pinball, which wasn't all that great.
1310720	1314802	I played quite a number of mobile phone games over at Namco Mobile.
1315903	1318884	Alright, let's go to chat room because now they're finally saying something interesting.
1318924	1320405	You know I'm only giving you a hard time, Chad.
1320445	1321106	You know I love you guys.
1321126	1324167	If you want to join in, tonight we're in chat.allgames.com.
1324207	1329330	We are hijacking the all games chat room for our own evil purposes.
1330671	1333912	CKY Mike says, Sky, anything about Resident Evil 5?
1334392	1337534	I don't think... It wasn't on the floor.
1337874	1338215	Oh, yeah.
1339335	1340276	It wasn't on the floor.
1340396	1346539	I think there was a trailer, but it was one of those... It was like the Final Fantasy XIII trailer.
1346619	1350862	What did that tell you besides, hey, it's being made and it's coming to the system?
1351650	1352090	That's it.
1352811	1354372	There really wasn't a lot of news on Resident Evil 5.
1354412	1359916	Well, there was a ton of games last year, too, that they were showing at Square Enix's booth that we didn't even see this year.
1360176	1360577	That's true.
1360597	1361377	So they disappeared.
1361537	1361878	Like what?
1361918	1362538	Give us examples.
1362558	1363959	I don't even remember what they're called now.
1365500	1369803	There was like a trilogy of games, all of which I was not interested in.
1370364	1372085	Then, also, Devil May Cry 4.
1372746	1374427	I didn't see that at all.
1374507	1376148	It wasn't even shown, and...
1377710	1383225	You know, what was really pissing me off was the fact that Fatal Inertia wasn't on the floor other than, you know, just video.
1385131	1385311	Wow.
1386035	1386335	DarkSakura.com
1415635	1418056	Oh, no, I don't know what my runner-up is right now.
1418076	1418877	Okay, all right.
1418957	1419737	Loki, do you have one?
1420878	1421918	Yeah.
1423159	1427582	You know, this one I actually didn't play because it was only a video.
1428362	1431083	But I'm going to have to go with Dead or Alive Extreme 2.
1433345	1434065	And why is this?
1436206	1439508	Because, sadly enough, I will probably buy that game.
1439808	1440889	Because he likes the boobies.
1441349	1442690	And I like the achievement points.
1444128	1444889	Danny likes the movies.
1444909	1447391	That's right, you're an achievement point whore.
1447471	1452074	Are you a fan of the Barbie dress-up mode, basically, where you get to choose bikinis for the girls and all that stuff?
1452194	1459920	I just had to laugh at that game just by looking at it, because it's so blatantly... It's like a Girls Gone Wild video.
1460840	1468846	It literally is like they have that new series of Girls Gone Wild videos that you see late at night, you know, where they're making them do games, okay?
1468906	1470167	Well, that's basically this.
1470828	1471148	Okay.
1472219	1475682	I would say my runner-up, I'll go next, my runner-up is Gears of War.
1476242	1478684	I thought Gears of War looked fantabulous.
1479205	1485450	What I also like about it is that it looks like they've designed it so any dummy can do cool moves in it, which I think is great.
1487091	1498361	Even though I'm not a huge shooter fan, I will go to that realm once in a while for a great, great shooter game like Halo, and I think Gears of War is going to be one of those great shooter games if the demo is any indication.
1498701	1500002	DarkSakura Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins
1523126	1523486	All right.
1523506	1523647	Yeah.
1547879	1548239	Excellent.
1548319	1548580	All right.
1548600	1551222	Well, congratulations to Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.
1551302	1552523	DarkSakura chooses you.
1553463	1553924	Scott.
1554444	1565773	I'll tell you, I've been sitting here kind of like rolling to my head, you know, and most of my thoughts have been, well, I do have a lot of most surprising, like surprise me good and most disappointing.
1566053	1566333	Okay.
1566373	1567795	But I'm going to save those for my show.
1567815	1569796	I'm going to answer your question specifically.
1570737	1572698	Best of show, there's no question in my mind.
1572738	1573559	Wait, you've got to do Runner Up.
1573879	1574720	Oh, Runner Up.
1575120	1575581	Oh, jeez.
1577221	1578522	Oh, God, Runner Up.
1579783	1580924	Yeah.
1581344	1581705	You know what?
1581825	1586068	I'm going to say, for Runner Up, I'm going to say Saints Row.
1586268	1593293	This is a game that, obviously, without a Grand Theft Auto title on the Xbox 360, I'm looking for that kind of open-ended...
1593993	1597016	Carjacking, blow stuff up, different kinds of weapons.
1597497	1605465	Obviously what I like about Saints Row is that it goes another step further and allows me to create anybody I want to be the main character.
1605525	1606405	And I really went for it.
1606446	1610850	I got the spiky here, big fat guy, and I could run around the city like that.
1610970	1613551	That's the one where you could be the girl or the guy, right?
1613811	1615791	I don't know if you could be the girl.
1615971	1617912	It's basically a gang type.
1617992	1619012	It's a THQ game.
1619032	1623853	It was at the Microsoft booth and then right across from Microsoft booth they had like three or four demo stations there.
1624293	1625534	But again, it's carjacking.
1625574	1627994	It's very similar to Grand Theft Auto.
1628014	1632335	It's made by Volition, the guys that did Red Faction and what was the other?
1633156	1634376	Free Space, Descent Free Space.
1634996	1636537	and it's well done.
1636597	1641079	I was always concerned because every time we've seen footage for this game, it's been choppy.
1641179	1642400	The frame rate has been bad.
1642980	1647682	The word has been that it's not going to be ready, it's not going to be good, and it's been delayed.
1648483	1650944	But my time with it was fun.
1651164	1654926	It definitely needs a little more work, but I would say that is my runner-up for Best of Show.
1655246	1655586	Awesome.
1656206	1656567	All right.
1657207	1662790	Best of Show, the best damn game at E3, period, using any criteria you want.
1662850	1663110	Loki.
1664409	1665331	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1680387	1681948	You know, Dead Rising, I love that game.
1682248	1686529	And I think it's one of those games that I'm going to be playing for hours.
1686869	1688110	And I've said that over and over.
1688350	1690790	It's just very open-ended.
1691391	1692511	You basically do anything.
1692551	1696732	The game's only about three hours long, but you can play it over and over and over and over again.
1696772	1699573	Give us a brief description of the game, because I don't think it's been brought up on the podcast yet.
1699673	1703515	Okay, well, Dead Rising basically is Dawn of the Dead, the game.
1703555	1714241	You play a main character who is this photojournalist, and you're stuck in a mall with a bunch of zombies, but you can kill the zombies in any way possible, anything that's anywhere in the game.
1714361	1718143	In stores, you can pick up any item and just use it as a weapon.
1718363	1719944	There's like over 200 items.
1720004	1722185	You can customize your character and the way he looks.
1722926	1723906	You can rescue people.
1723966	1725307	You take photos of stuff.
1726848	1728409	It's just a really unique...
1729130	1730992	Thank you for watching!
1747433	1749374	The interactiveness, I love that stuff.
1749414	1752956	I love the fact that what your friends do can screw up your world.
1753376	1761459	I love the freedom to abduct aliens and then hurl them into space and watch them fall crashing down to Earth in a bloody pulp.
1761559	1763901	It looks like one of those games you're going to have the freedom to do whatever you want.
1764281	1766302	It's going to be incredible.
1766842	1771984	Don't get me wrong, I love PC gaming, but I would love to see a game like this on 360 as well, if it's possible.
1772584	1773325	Maybe, I don't know.
1774085	1775626	I just think it might be too massive.
1776226	1777607	for the confines of a console though.
1777627	1781649	So PC gamers, you really are getting a good one with this one, Spore.
1781989	1782670	DarkSakura.
1783210	1784851	I'm going to go with Zelda, honestly.
1785051	1791494	It was... I love the Zelda series, like almost every one of them with the exception of Majora's Mask and Wind Waker.
1793896	1804281	So this looked like it was really following directly in the footsteps of Ocarina of Time, which was probably one of my favorites in the series.
1805022	1805102	Um...
1807326	1812388	Just having the Wii, the Wii-con, or Wiimote.
1812408	1813709	The Wiimote as I call it, yes.
1813749	1815210	The Wiicon as I call it.
1815930	1827776	You know, feeling the shake of the chain as you throw the claw hook, hearing it impact, you know, hearing the twang of your bow as it flies back, that is if you put the thing right by your ear.
1830066	1845017	The control was a little bit interesting to get used to, but other than that, it was... And it really didn't look like it was touched up much more than the GameCube, but honestly, everyone who listens to our show knows about how much I give a damn about the graphics, which is, like, hardly any.
1845697	1846678	It was fun.
1847018	1847919	It was a lot of fun.
1848219	1854144	And probably the most fun of anything I played, you know, next to Ghost of Goblin, so that gets it.
1854164	1854524	Alright.
1856326	1861735	That's an interesting choice because Zelda was such a huge game at last year's E3.
1862076	1863538	Was enough changed?
1864574	1865895	There was quite a bit changed.
1866996	1872059	I didn't get to see the demo, but I had talked to plenty who did.
1872079	1872599	You mean last year?
1872619	1873120	Right, last year.
1874361	1876342	I had gone back and seen things later of it.
1876402	1879544	It looks like they've really cleaned it up.
1879624	1893774	I was actually just checking out that issue of EGM sitting over on the couch, and they had a few side-by-side comparisons for the Twilight World, where they had it sort of a monochrome color before, and now they've gone through and touched it up and added in,
1895014	1895335	All right.
1895395	1895855	So that was good.
1921169	1924671	All right, chat room wants to know, Derek H is asking, is Scott asleep?
1924971	1925692	No, not at all.
1925792	1927793	You've got to be an exhausted guy, though.
1927813	1928614	I'm a little tired.
1928694	1932216	With all this going on here at the E3 Outpost, which is awesome.
1932236	1933697	This is a great idea, by the way.
1933777	1934377	Thanks for having us.
1934898	1937119	And E3 and all that other stuff.
1937139	1938000	It's got a long week.
1938320	1940181	It's a little tiring, as you guys know.
1940221	1944204	I mean, you did the same show I did, and you've been here just as much as I have.
1944264	1945284	So you're tired, too.
1945604	1947165	But it's all good because E3 is over.
1947185	1948446	But we get to leave tomorrow.
1948466	1949607	You do get to leave tomorrow.
1950588	1951748	Scott, your best of show.
1952009	1957413	I think people are going to be surprised that I love Viva Pinata as much as I do.
1957613	1958033	Wow.
1958113	1958674	No, I'm kidding.
1958914	1960015	Oh, you bastard.
1960635	1961516	You bastard.
1962456	1965859	You had me going for a minute.
1966119	1967260	Not Viva Pinata.
1967280	1970682	Big shout out to Silent Wind there who made the trek from Bakersfield.
1970722	1973805	I tried my damnedest to get him into E3 and I could not do it.
1973845	1975266	I'm very sorry about that, Silent Wind.
1976006	1977408	No, there's no question in my mind.
1977908	1978629	You've already said it.
1978729	1981491	Sport is the absolute best game at E3 this year.
1981811	1983853	Will Wright is a freaking genius.
1984514	1991360	We went into that little room and, you know, I thought I knew pretty much everything there was to know about the game and then I realized...
1992300	2006291	All the creatures you find in the game have essentially been combined with a trading card element so that you can print out these trading cards and play like a Magic the Gathering type game with it off the computer completely.
2006311	2007151	Oh, I had heard.
2007692	2010794	The stuff they want to do with it is phenomenal, those things you were talking about.
2010874	2027744	We also had inside the room creatures that were like action figures, statuettes, and he made them with a 3D printer right from the game, which I believe will be possible to print out your creatures that you create and make them into like figurines that you can have in your room.
2028024	2035390	See, Orange Lounge, when Loki and I went there, we aren't cool enough to have Will Wright demo it himself for us, so we got some other girl, but she was good.
2035670	2037651	You went into the little room?
2037711	2037912	Yeah.
2038192	2038752	Oh, so did we.
2039012	2039733	I was surprised.
2039773	2041915	I was expecting you to be one of Will's minions.
2042175	2042435	Yeah.
2042495	2043196	A little sim minion.
2043236	2043916	No, we got a minion.
2045117	2046858	Oh, he was great.
2047058	2053103	I mean, he only showed the kind of third level and space level.
2053163	2055324	You didn't get to see the kind of amoebic level.
2055764	2066352	But what I think is so phenomenal about this, and you talked about it, sharing the content, you know, anyone who knows SimCity and the Sims knows that there is, like he says, 10% of the people who buy those games that make
2066932	2067212	and so on.
2089816	2110350	You encounter this creature, you attack this creature, you can see who made it, find more of the creatures they've made, and then the ability to go from Amoeba to galactic, outside, millions of planets, and when you think about how many units of Sims sold, and how many units of Spore will sell, the promise, you know, a lot of game developers, well,
2110470	2114132	Our community will be so big, we'll have so much content, and usually there's nothing good.
2114632	2127497	You know that a Will Wright game will get the audience, it'll get the customers, and it'll get the creativity, and I think we're going to be playing just an incalculable amount of creative characters and creatures in this game.
2127677	2130738	You know, when I was sitting there watching the demo, I was always saying, this is too good to be true.
2130778	2131718	This is too ambitious.
2131958	2134959	But then I remember, oh yeah, there's like 20 Sims expansions packs.
2135019	2137620	So, you know, anything's possible.
2137700	2139640	Yeah, and I do believe that you're right.
2139860	2146742	It is kind of so big that maybe people won't be able to kind of get through it and won't be able to get to all elements of it.
2147602	2171858	but that's kind of what I like about this game is that it is very open and sandboxy so you can just play around and create stuff you can play around at any of the levels but if you're a hardcore gamer and you're looking for the more than the eight hour black game experience you know Spore will deliver probably way it'll be on the World of Warcraft scale of gameplay I have no doubt it'll do well
2172779	2175640	And if it doesn't do well, there's something wrong with the gaming community.
2175720	2181883	The only hint that it might not do well is you can look at Sims Online and say, well, that was an alright game and it didn't do well.
2181943	2185925	But Sims Online was a dumb idea.
2185985	2187606	Sims Online just turned into Vegas.
2187646	2188847	It was a bunch of hookers and drugs.
2189067	2192689	There's just a couple key things that were wrong with it, unfortunately.
2192789	2194429	Anyway, let's keep it moving.
2194730	2196650	Worst game of the show.
2196811	2198131	Worst game of the show.
2198591	2199272	Anybody want to start off?
2199312	2199572	Loki?
2201775	2205879	You know, I almost want to say Africa.
2207501	2217051	But, since I didn't get to play it, I didn't really get to play this game either, but I think it's a stupid idea for a game.
2217872	2219614	The Eye of Judgment.
2222043	2223024	Worst game ever.
2223284	2233050	And the reason why is because it's not really a game, and the fact that it reminds me of something that you would create to kind of enhance a Magic the Gathering tournament.
2233291	2238594	Like something to throw on the TV if you were going to broadcast a Magic the Gathering tournament type thing.
2239295	2241336	That's about as useful as it is.
2242957	2251523	The fact that you have to remember to remove cards from the playing field so that the PlayStation doesn't accidentally spawn the creature again is stupid.
2252883	2257784	My worst game of the show would be found over at 2K Games, this booth.
2258404	2263425	It's the new Family Feud game coming to, what, I think PlayStation 2.
2264085	2272487	And while granted there might be a market for the Family Feud game, I had the Family Feud game on the Commodore 64 and not a goddamn thing has changed.
2273107	2274928	Why would we need this?
2275048	2276208	This is so, I don't know.
2276348	2277649	The survey says you're right.
2277669	2280592	74% said you are correct.
2280672	2281593	It's the worst game of the show.
2281613	2284395	Survey says this game sucks.
2285336	2287638	And the hosts have changed so many times.
2287738	2295104	I mean, if you're going to bring me a Family Feud game, at least give me Richard Dawson trying to make out with the chicks that were all on that show.
2295745	2296685	Who's the host?
2296705	2297966	The guy that committed suicide?
2298066	2300227	Some random guy.
2300887	2303568	I know on the real TV show, I think it's the guy from Home Improvement.
2304729	2306589	I guess they couldn't get his likeness for the game.
2306889	2307810	Too expensive, I bet.
2308110	2309210	His license is huge.
2309390	2310651	What a piece of poop.
2310811	2317394	And to think, that game was next to Dora the Explorer, and I still named Family Feud.
2318434	2321195	All right, DarkSakura, worst freaking game at E3.
2321535	2322295	Sonic the Hedgehog.
2324156	2324676	Which one?
2325276	2326337	The PS3 one.
2326897	2327417	Ouch.
2327757	2329638	Team Sonic rolling over.
2330018	2333719	And she is such a Sega fangirl that there must be some atrocities.
2334119	2334980	The control.
2335641	2336863	The game was pretty.
2337523	2339206	And I mean, it was really, really pretty.
2339566	2341569	Except for some of the jaggies on the PS3.
2342490	2345493	But you know, even the Xbox 360 one, because I did go back and check that out.
2346054	2347937	The control was utter crap.
2348537	2349899	You turn it just, you know...
2350780	2353561	The best controlling version of Sonic Adventure was on the Dreamcast.
2353761	2354621	It was smooth.
2354861	2357822	Why couldn't they have taken a page from the Dreamcast?
2358102	2358943	They do it right.
2359623	2363584	They have it to where if you just go a little bit to the left, drop the cliff.
2364424	2371586	And then on top of that, the angle that they have him fall at, you can see that the platform that you've been standing on is just floating in the air.
2372267	2373567	He just falls into nothingness.
2374467	2379349	And I was like, if they're at least going to do that, have it from an overhead angle and have him fade out, you know?
2380189	2384071	So, I could see there were a few collision detection issues.
2384111	2388334	The thing is, is that they can do a good Sonic game.
2389274	2390995	I mean, I played Sonic Rivals, that was fun.
2391996	2398199	But, I have to call it the worst game if they take something that I adore so much and make utter crap out of it.
2398659	2399060	Alright.
2399440	2401781	So, it gets worst game on Control alone.
2402241	2403462	I'm sorry to hear it.
2403502	2404182	Alright, Scott.
2404222	2406263	So am I. Worst freaking game at E3.
2407623	2411204	This time I'm not kidding when I say people will be surprised when they hear me say this.
2412264	2415885	Madden for the PlayStation 3 was the worst game that I played at E3.
2416666	2424008	I have to tell you, if you're a PlayStation guy, girl, and you're expecting to pick up a PS3 at launch, and you like Madden,
2424728	2429211	Get ready to go through what we went through last year with the Xbox 360 version.
2429471	2435234	From the words of an EA Sports employee, the game will not work right.
2435494	2437275	They're just saying they haven't had enough time.
2437755	2438616	It's going to be just like the 360.
2439697	2441558	They still don't have final dev kits.
2442858	2460089	Madden has been completely rebuilt and when you rebuild and you try to let people in the house you're rebuilding before it's done it's gonna feel like it's not done and Madden on the 360 wasn't done he acknowledged that he said you know you're right it was broken and he said that's gonna be the same way this year
2460789	2468476	and I would have thought all the work they did since the release of the 360 version would have carried over to the PS3, but unfortunately no.
2468776	2482569	The best thing about Madden really is they've got 3D grass for the first time, so if you're excited about 3D grass, you'll be happy with the new Madden, but otherwise, PS3 Madden, it was the worst thing I played, it was a joke.
2482749	2483690	Wow, that's...
2484130	2484370	Wow.
2485171	2489115	Now, we don't talk a lot about sports games on this show, but even the non- You're allergic, right?
2489315	2491277	No, I mean, I like Blades of Steel.
2491897	2492978	Okay.
2493018	2493979	I like Tecmo Bowl.
2494159	2494940	I like NBA Jam.
2495060	2495681	Those are good games.
2496381	2497282	Here's the thing, though.
2497302	2501886	What I'm curious about, even the non-sports games fans are interested in Madden on the Wii.
2502527	2507372	I'm curious, what are your thoughts, sports game fan of Madden on the Wii?
2508092	2516038	I'll tell you, all the sports games on the Wii are going to benefit from the fact that we've been pushing buttons for sports games for years.
2516818	2520721	And I found the novelty of using the controllers really enjoyable.
2521501	2523663	I found it to be a new challenge in the game.
2524363	2531028	Instead of just adding a vision cone to a game, I found throwing the ball, like using the motion of throwing a ball,
2531988	2534369	was really kind of cool and it really appealed to me.
2535089	2544713	I think that they've just kind of begun to tip the iceberg of what's possible in terms of unique gameplay elements with this special controller.
2545373	2550835	And I have to say I was surprised that it didn't feel cheesy gimmicky even at this early stage.
2551555	2575544	I think graphically it'll be able to be decent enough that it won't be a disappointment to people who are kind of used to the graphics they have but I have to tell you I think that if you can lock in the Wii controller into the kind of sports games we're used to whether it be hockey from the guys at 2K Sports or baseball from the guys at 2K or EA even
2576464	2579247	and what I'd really like to see is a boxing game used the Wii.
2579947	2592817	I think people who are sports fans are going to be ready to make this jump because let's face it for years we've been playing sports games the exact same way and just watching the guy play baseball with the Wii controller
2593658	2594458	It made me excited.
2595059	2599141	Graphically, I think the Nintendo sports games, they need to evolve a little.
2599541	2604183	I'm a little tired of these cutesy little Japanese characters for my baseball games and my tennis games.
2604223	2607304	I'd like to see some realistic players here in 2006.
2608365	2610986	But the Miyamoto in tennis was hilarious, you have to admit.
2611066	2611926	Oh, the faces.
2611986	2613847	That was the best part of the press conference.
2614147	2614868	Reggie Fils-Aimé.
2616368	2621470	Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto on the faces of those characters.
2622090	2625931	Clearly the show stealer at the Nintendo press conference.
2626071	2627212	That was pretty adorable.
2627252	2628052	Let's go around.
2628832	2633034	Best booth, worst... Well, let's start with best booth using any criteria you want.
2633334	2635215	Best booth using any criteria you want.
2636035	2639796	It can be design, it can be what was in it, it can be the way the staff treated you.
2640416	2641477	Any criteria you want.
2641557	2641877	Loki.
2643237	2647879	I would have to say Sega's booth was probably the best booth that I played at, at least.
2648679	2655681	I liked Full Auto 2, and I loved being able to play multiplayer in Chromehounds.
2657202	2662883	So I think they had a really good setup, the videos were everywhere, so I liked it.
2662903	2664344	And they were giving away lots of stuff.
2666004	2666324	So yeah.
2666724	2668285	DarkSakura, best booth at E3?
2668305	2668345	Uh...
2673390	2674271	PSP Area PSP Area
2693309	2695091	I liked the couches.
2695271	2698895	You could sit down and your feet were like, I'm sitting down.
2699136	2701959	You know what, the way you played those PSP demos was very interesting.
2702159	2709146	I know, that's how I sit on my couch and play, sort of half sideways, but I thought that it was a neat, it was easy to get to everything.
2709467	2711048	You weren't crowded like, you know,
2711929	2715353	I can't believe I'm about to say this because three years ago
2731969	2736233	This would never... Best and this company would have never come out of my mouth.
2736654	2743400	But times have changed so much, and this year's E3 proved that Microsoft has got the best booth to show.
2743921	2745302	I would agree with that.
2745823	2751268	Microsoft is in such an interesting position right now, because they do have a year ahead.
2751888	2754771	And every problem I had with the Xbox...
2755765	2756886	They got it this time.
2757526	2760067	There is something for the role-playing fans.
2760207	2761708	Enchanted Arms looks great.
2761968	2764189	There is something for the cutesy people.
2764289	2767611	Viva Pinata... Well, okay, maybe there'll be something else next year.
2769112	2774494	There is something for sports people, action people.
2774975	2777016	And the way the booth was laid out was smart.
2777856	2782857	Their demonstration was inside a little room, the Gears of War thing, where the floor vibrated.
2783197	2784257	You got your ticket.
2784517	2785278	You came back.
2785338	2787618	I'm sorry, you put headphones on.
2787798	2788638	I'm just so excited.
2788678	2790059	I'm getting everywhere.
2790359	2799101	But Microsoft, the people would come up and talk to you, did not judge you based on your credentials, were happy and excited to tell you about the game.
2799841	2803261	I'm so surprised at how far Microsoft has come.
2803361	2805482	By far and above the best booth in E3 2017.
2805902	2810963	I actually do have to agree with you there because I was impressed with the area they had laid out for DDR.
2811824	2815785	They gave you enough space to play that you're not face up in front of the TV.
2815945	2816545	They sure did.
2816665	2826768	And also, at the end of the show they had these people walking around taking photos and attaching it like little Polaroids and attaching it in a frame.
2827268	2828829	And I talked to one of the girls over there.
2828849	2830069	She was just as friendly as she could be.
2830649	2838715	She's saying, oh yeah, Method Man just came by here and talking about how some of the less savory people there, we both agreed that we just like Paris Hilton.
2839115	2854126	And now the chat room is getting a little angsty at me naming Microsoft because, you know, I think there's a lot of people still in that area where they don't want to go over the Microsoft products yet because Microsoft hasn't done enough outside the realm of sports and driving and stuff that's won them over yet.
2854706	2856527	I'm telling you guys, they're on the right path.
2856927	2856947	I...
2857968	2869017	and don't get me wrong, there's even nice things about the PlayStation 3 and of course about the Wii, but Microsoft is really in a good position right now and just the booth itself was great.
2869657	2876523	It was not packed like it was a couple years ago because they were more intelligent about where they put everything.
2876903	2878765	So it was easier to access things.
2878825	2882447	I mean, just on all those levels, I'm considering and it's great.
2883048	2885690	Scott, oh, Scott took his headphones off.
2885730	2886871	I'm sorry, are you on your way out or?
2887011	2892716	No, no, I just got an emergency phone call just to tell me that they love the show.
2893557	2894578	Oh, thank you.
2894598	2895379	They're just calling in.
2895399	2897160	They said, I love the show that you guys are doing.
2897400	2897781	Keep it up.
2898101	2898602	Thank you.
2899142	2901024	Whoever that was, hello and thank you.
2901064	2901624	Appreciate it.
2901664	2902285	They're enjoying it.
2902365	2902705	All right.
2903046	2904967	Best freaking booth at E3.
2906389	2914437	I agree, Microsoft's booth was very good, but it is, to me, hard to deny what EA is able to put together each year.
2914457	2920403	And, you know, it's more about that Thunderdome and the way they put together that video.
2921184	2928972	You know, it is kind of a lot of responsibility to be the first thing people see when they walk into the Big South Hall, and I think that EA...
2929492	2929732	and so on.
2950569	2952370	Big, clear game stations.
2952971	2964259	For example, Superman today, I was expecting not to be able to get any kind of demo, but I stood there, watched him give a great demo to one person, then he left, and I got to, you know, really get up close and ask a lot of questions.
2964699	2966881	And I just think that they've designed it really well.
2966941	2969203	It's clean, the way it's laid out.
2969643	2974747	I went into the little private area room with the NFL Network, and even back there, it's just very nice.
2976888	2981532	The people were friendly, and I just found that to be, you know, a good job.
2981592	2983233	And for God's sakes, it better be.
2983253	2984374	They've got all the money in the world.
2984414	2986575	They've got a lot of big AAA titles.
2987236	2989778	And they got the best spot in the entire show.
2989838	2990959	Better than even the big three.
2991019	2998024	So I have to say, I thought the EA booth... Now, I did want to jump quickly back to your earlier question about most surprising.
2998284	2998704	Yeah.
2998744	3002807	Because I remembered something that's right up the OLR alley.
3002987	3003087	Okay.
3003107	3003348	Yeah.
3004008	3019441	In Kensha Hall, I was checking out the no-vent controller, but across from them was a booth showing off the world's first massively multiplayer DDR game.
3019981	3021441	I thought that was interesting.
3021461	3022962	It surprised me.
3023042	3026423	It's too bad I couldn't understand it because it was all in a different language.
3026443	3028343	But I looked at it and I went, hmm, that's interesting.
3030044	3030604	I was shocked.
3030644	3035246	I was like, wow, there are people dancing together online all over the world.
3036586	3040047	I thought that was kind of shocking, surprising, and weird.
3040467	3040767	Worst Booth
3054969	3066634	That's really hard for me to say because honestly the worst booth as far as its showing went was I was really underwhelmed also by the PS3 area.
3068654	3070435	Sony overall gets best and worst.
3070855	3074957	They get best for layout, worst for games because
3075817	3088215	I mean, true, they were, they did have, you know, Tekken and Ghosts and Goblins, but when you went up to the PS3 area, it was all, I was surrounded by so much crap that it literally stank, and I had to get out of there.
3088716	3089037	Alright.
3089497	3090439	Loki, we're smooth.
3090499	3090959	Nintendo.
3091600	3091860	Why?
3092260	3099423	Nintendo's booth, you had to wait in a four-hour line to get into another booth to where you'd wait another hour to play a game.
3099983	3105965	So it was a line to wait in another line to wait to play some games, which were just tech demos.
3106225	3110247	And then the jackasses that were, you know, working on the demos there, freaking...
3110427	3113369	Yeah, five minutes made quick, you know, that type of stuff.
3113429	3114610	It was just very hurried.
3114890	3122154	They let people in, they were, just people weren't leaving, so there's hundreds of people, you know, moshed in there, like a club or something.
3122174	3125176	It just wasn't very conducive to being able to play the games.
3125516	3128358	The DS stations, as Bobby mentioned earlier,
3128738	3129659	Thank you for watching!
3145260	3146041	What else could be wrong?
3146121	3148222	Oh, no, Game Boy Advance, but no, I don't really miss that.
3149043	3153406	When Booth had Game Boy Advance games, that was SNK, which was like one game.
3153426	3156788	But not even Nintendo was showing it, so it's too bad.
3156868	3162693	I actually am really surprised that you said they were being rude, because the people I dealt with at Nintendo were nothing but brilliantly nice.
3162873	3164574	Actually, I had really nice people, too.
3164674	3174201	That girl got me Koji Kono's autograph, and then the guy who was there at Zelda, he was all like, you know, helping me out with some of the controls until I got used to it, and
3174781	3175782	Thanks for watching!
3191517	3191857	Wow.
3192938	3195640	I would also say Nintendo was the worst booth at E3.
3195720	3197982	And don't get me wrong, I love the Wii.
3198802	3200083	I mean, I'm going to buy the Wii.
3200183	3200984	I think it's awesome.
3201324	3207529	But the design of the booth was shit because last... I mean, when they did the DS, it was so much better.
3207809	3214554	You go in, they show the preview, they have a set amount of time that you get to spend with the demos.
3214854	3219878	And, you know, there's incentive to go back through because you may get to go to the demo room that has even more demos.
3219898	3220278	There's much...
3220698	3221659	SmarterMade that year.
3221979	3227282	I'm pissed that they didn't show anything on GameCube because that Paper Mario, Super Paper Mario, whatever it was, looks awesome.
3227742	3229564	And it's a crime that that wasn't on the floor.
3230724	3234507	It's sad that they're ignoring the advance when they were pushing the micro so hard last year.
3234847	3239250	Nintendo made some... Whoever designed Nintendo's booth should be fired for E307.
3239630	3240731	Bring back the old booth.
3240811	3241691	Honestly, it was better.
3242392	3245654	And it's sad I'm making that judgment not even based on the content.
3246374	3249536	and the fact that I dealt with some very nice people in Nintendo, it's too bad.
3249556	3252278	But the booth design cannot be ignored.
3252358	3254940	It was a horrible way to show the Wii.
3255160	3256061	Scott, worst booth?
3257122	3258483	Let's see, worst booth.
3259083	3260644	There's so many to choose from.
3261105	3270852	It's very difficult because I found a lot of these booths to be poorly designed, poorly laid out, poor choice of costume people.
3272753	3273273	You know?
3273754	3273774	I...
3275700	3281202	I think I'm going to say I'm going to agree with you guys that Nintendo was poorly designed.
3281222	3284923	I think they were in a tough position because they knew everyone that goes to E3.
3284963	3292305	There's no way you leave E3 07 without having to at least try the Wii because there's only what?
3292386	3295627	PC, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Microsoft.
3295927	3299928	And if you were to go back and people would say, wow, we heard about this crazy controller.
3299968	3300508	Did you play it?
3300528	3302569	And you said, no, you're kind of a loser.
3303189	3309794	and the fact that they made it so difficult and the fact that they didn't show a lot of the stuff that people wanted to see.
3310674	3314117	Yeah, I mean, you gotta say boo to Nintendo.
3314277	3314337	Boo.
3315838	3316898	Sorry, sorry.
3316918	3319020	You know, I still consider myself a Nintendo fanboy.
3319040	3320181	Well, really, I'm a gaming fanboy.
3320201	3320681	I like them all.
3321001	3325344	But Nintendo, that boot design, fire the architect.
3325584	3326005	Fire him.
3326445	3327986	Bobby wanted to interject something real quick.
3329127	3330568	Did anybody here say LucasArts?
3333622	3335043	That's my runner up.
3335223	3335964	That's my runner up.
3336224	3337325	What are you hiding, LucasArts?
3337345	3341988	Who kept their booth closed for two days, then opened it up with a line?
3342008	3343068	Two and a half days.
3343088	3344069	Two and a half days.
3344469	3347591	They opened it up at noon today, then it was a line.
3348071	3350733	Who cares about LucasArts after that point?
3350873	3356937	It looked like it was a museum in there, which means it was nothing more than a George Lucas ego inflation thing.
3356957	3359699	Yeah, but they had a video of people that worked there going...
3360686	3363328	The next generation... What was the line?
3363348	3366070	There was something about... I don't know because I haven't saw it.
3366091	3368092	We will make the next generation game.
3368112	3370334	You know the video wall when you're walking towards West Hall?
3370674	3373156	Well, why don't you make it outside where we can see it?
3373176	3375859	Does that mean they haven't done crap yet?
3376239	3377740	Yeah, they always do that.
3377760	3381063	That's an elitist mentality and, you know, that's LucasArts for you.
3381243	3383845	I actually have a category I'd like to ask everyone about.
3383865	3384826	Okay, we've got to make it real quick.
3384846	3385346	Really quick.
3385366	3387868	What was the most bizarre thing you saw?
3388729	3392051	The line of people to see Paris Hilton, get out of my E3.
3392611	3392991	Get out.
3393031	3393912	What are you people doing there?
3393932	3395752	It is not a celebrity gawk fest.
3396833	3397133	Loki?
3398134	3411660	The strangest thing I saw, I would have to say, because there wasn't too much weird stuff, but at the very end as we were walking out, there was some impromptu dance party going on in the N-Gage booth, and I don't know what that was about.
3411900	3412681	That was horrible.
3413501	3417163	Despite the fact I bash on the N-Gage an awful lot, their booth was actually pretty...
3417703	3418303	I couldn't go in.
3418343	3419784	It was almost like I was Superman.
3419844	3420605	It was Kryptonite.
3420685	3425227	I think I would try to walk towards the N-Gage booth and I physically was pushed backwards.
3425327	3429669	I used it to cut through to get around the massive Konami people watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer.
3429969	3430570	But you know what?
3430590	3432050	The booth design was slick.
3432591	3433531	Still hate the thing.
3433691	3436092	I still hate the N-Gage, but the design is slick.
3436172	3437393	They tried to sell it really well.
3437493	3438974	You're reminding me too much of the Apple Store.
3439334	3440154	Alright, you.
3440475	3443216	Okay, my most bizarre thing was WTF.
3445093	3446094	Work Time Fun
3461314	3464518	Okay, my weird thing was two things.
3464739	3468464	One, those stupid inflatable rafts people were wearing on their back.
3468484	3478297	To see people in suits walking around with webs and inflatable rafts on their back, I just wanted to push them so that they'd fall and bounce and bounce back up.
3479218	3480659	I just wanted to do that all day.
3481039	3482339	Worst giveaway I've ever seen.
3483180	3489242	And the other thing is these hordes of people that stand in line for ridiculous things.
3489302	3491083	Now, okay, I like Adam West.
3491543	3494565	I just don't understand wasting, you know, the show's three days.
3495545	3497566	Two and three quarters because the last day is short.
3498246	3516575	Why are people spending their time waiting in lines, A, to see old celebrities or even like a Paris Hilton, like you said, and B, to get a small little trinket of something that you will probably lose very quickly or never use in your life.
3516615	3518356	If it's something cool, I'm all about it.
3518696	3520817	But I see people waiting as though...
3521897	3524520	They're going to receive communion from the Pope or something.
3524580	3526842	It's just very, very bizarre.
3527522	3532106	Along the same lines, why do they go stand behind G4's booth to try and get on TV?
3533806	3534006	E3 G4 Booth
3555239	3555759	I know, I know.
3555839	3557080	Anyway, we've got to wrap it up.
3558100	3558881	Thank you guys.
3558921	3560121	This was a great show.
3560501	3563523	Scott Rubin, thank you so much for joining us on tonight's program.
3563703	3567324	You guys are welcome back here anytime, any day.
3567344	3568985	It's been a pleasure to have.
3569045	3569986	It's been a lot of fun.
3570166	3574908	And like I said to you earlier before the show, anybody who's got a passion for gaming,
3575248	3576929	And you guys have been doing this show so long.
3576969	3578789	It's a real testament to your passion for gaming.
3579210	3581891	And your audience is a lucky group of people.
3581911	3586492	And I'm glad the All Games crew has had a chance to experience OLR live from E3.
3586512	3587093	Thank you.
3587153	3588013	And you know what, Scott?
3588273	3588933	Thank you so much.
3588973	3598697	You know, I would have never thought, having, you know, four years ago, that we would be sitting here with somebody who has been to the ends of gaming media, you know, on the TV and stuff.
3598937	3600078	This is surreal.
3600118	3601098	Thank you so much for having us.
3601118	3601718	This is awesome.
3601858	3602759	All right.
3603439	3605960	All right, Bobby, thank you so much for being here as well.
3605980	3606720	We appreciate it.
3606760	3608401	Your three days of hard work on the program.
3608821	3613083	Yeah, well, no, actually, and what I wanted to say is, you know, that I really appreciate being here.
3613123	3615084	A lot of your people listening probably don't know.
3615564	3618565	I was listening to Orange Lounge Radio before they started podcasting.
3618645	3622507	I had listened to some of their live shows before the whole podcasting fact.
3622827	3626208	And then I was listening to their podcast since before I was doing a show.
3626688	3628149	So for me as a fan...
3628809	3631572	It's been a thrill to be able to be up here with the guys.
3632273	3635737	A lot of listeners probably would kill to be able to sit at least for one show.
3635797	3636318	I got two!
3636878	3638480	I got two shows with the OLR guys.
3638841	3643226	So thank you, and thank you to the OLR chatters for welcoming me and the family.
3643646	3647090	It was kind of really weird today when people were asking me, please be on the show again today.
3647310	3649032	Move to Sacramento, we'll talk about it.
3649833	3650394	All right.
3650834	3651154	All right.
3651735	3652115	Thank you.
3653016	3655798	I really would like to thank our OL Army for showing up in force.
3656178	3656579	Yeah.
3656859	3657699	You guys are awesome.
3657980	3658260	In chat.
3658500	3660362	I was very impressed to see so many people.
3660782	3663064	And it was cool to meet some of you at E3 also.
3663304	3663604	Yeah.
3663664	3664665	Met up with a few people.
3664805	3665606	And Justin.
3665766	3666587	Oh, my gosh.
3666807	3667547	Oh, my gosh, Justin.
3667567	3668008	That's our guy.
3668028	3669709	You don't even know how bad I owe you.
3671310	3673852	Bandit in chat says, support all games.
3674253	3675894	Kill G4, damn posers.
3677055	3677916	Interesting comment.
3680199	3680680	You know what?
3681120	3684324	If you want the real gaming media, you're going to have to go to the Internet.
3685085	3685725	I agree with that.
3685825	3686086	All right.
3686887	3687367	Let's wrap it up.
3687407	3688368	Final, final thoughts.
3688549	3689650	Final thoughts of E3.
3690571	3692453	Scott, you want to indulge us with a final thought?
3692573	3693454	Final thoughts of E3.
3693494	3696297	You know, every year we get very excited looking up to it.
3696337	3697439	I think this year...
3698359	3709602	Because it is a transition year, I think I'm so shocked at how disappointing Sony's showing was that I almost don't feel the same as I ever have leaving an E3 before.
3709962	3714543	Obviously those movies last year left us on such a high point, we couldn't believe, is it real, is it real?
3714963	3719404	And this year the reality feels like a really wet towel smacking me in the face.
3720444	3726986	But being a guy that went out and got a 360, it just kind of shows that sometimes when you
3727706	3730529	are there on day one to adopt the new technology.
3731189	3734872	It pays off in the end, and so I'm glad I have a next-gen system.
3734892	3739976	I don't feel like I got burnt, and hopefully Sony will surprise us when they release this machine in November.
3740256	3741537	All right, Bobby, final thought.
3743699	3744620	I'm ready to go home.
3745518	3746639	Loki, final thought.
3747399	3748280	Man, this is weird.
3748360	3755464	I don't really want to leave here because I swear, having come here like every day this week, it feels like a second home almost.
3756004	3756964	It's just, I don't know.
3757184	3759926	I need more plasma screens in my house, I think.
3760166	3761347	Your new wife missed you.
3761367	3763848	That's a real show of emotion from Loki.
3763908	3765869	I haven't seen this kind of emotion from him all week.
3765969	3767010	I know, this is crazy.
3767030	3770172	Well, I'm sorry I've been kind of buried in a laptop all week.
3770232	3771352	You really have.
3771392	3771913	How's that been?
3771993	3772393	A success?
3775814	3777915	It's as good as one person can do.
3778915	3780915	Maybe next year we'll have a bigger crew.
3781535	3783276	My final thought, and then I'll let DarkSakura go.
3783596	3788256	My final thought would be, I was dissing on the chat room earlier, but secretly I love you guys.
3788376	3791877	You guys are the reason why we do this show.
3791977	3794017	I mean, not just chatters, but listeners in general.
3794457	3798578	I mean, just the feedback and the positive support we've gotten is just amazing.
3798678	3801199	So thank you so much, and that's that.
3801239	3801819	We'll see you at E307.
3801859	3802239	DarkSakura.
3803979	3805000	Rejects false icons.
3805020	3805721	Say no to Sony.
