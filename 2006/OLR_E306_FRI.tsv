0	28000	We are live at the E3 Outpost for this Friday 2006 E3 edition.
28000	36000	Welcome everybody to the Friday edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	40000	We are here live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles,
40000	44000	where we've been taping our post-E3 shows all week long.
44000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.
46000	49000	Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	51000	Yo, what up?
51000	53000	And of course, Tech Massa Loki.
53000	54000	Hello.
54000	58000	And moseying his way on over to a microphone there.
58000	66000	Joining us for this last of our E3 shows is the one and only Bobby Blackwell,
66000	68000	who has no microphone right now.
68000	70000	That's all right.
70000	74000	We have mic troubles. That's all right. Live radio, boys and girls.
74000	75000	I think...
75000	76000	It's coming.
76000	78000	There you go. There you are. That's all right.
78000	81000	And of course, once again, wave hello to producer Lawrence Young,
81000	83000	who's over there in the corner.
83000	85000	God, I wish we could take him back to Sacramento with us.
85000	87000	He's been awesome all week long.
87000	88000	All right.
88000	91000	Again, if you're downloading this podcast,
91000	92000	you've listened to us before,
92000	94000	but you're not sure why you're hearing all the background noise tonight.
94000	96000	We're live. It's a big little party.
96000	98000	A big little party.
98000	100000	It's a little space, but it's a big party.
100000	103000	And there's lots of people here, and they're playing games.
103000	105000	Like I see Soul Calibur. I can't tell if it's two or three.
105000	107000	We have some Smash Brothers still going on.
107000	109000	There's Smash Brothers. Everybody loves Smash Brothers.
109000	111000	I see Halo down there.
111000	112000	Mario Kart Double Dash.
112000	115000	I would think people would be sick of games by the end of this show.
115000	117000	Fight Night Round 3.
117000	119000	I think they even had Rampage Soul Construction.
119000	120000	Oh, awesome.
120000	122000	They have black going on on one of the TVs over there.
122000	124000	Sweet.
124000	128000	I don't know about you guys, but I think I might be sick of games after today.
128000	131000	No, I'm kidding. You know I'll go right back home and play games again,
131000	132000	but boy, overload.
132000	134000	I was going to say, do you have a fever?
134000	136000	Are you feeling okay?
136000	138000	No, it's great. It's exhausting.
138000	140000	And I know a lot of people sitting at home
140000	142000	are probably screaming at me going,
142000	145000	Sky, you ungrateful bastard, at least you get to go to E3.
145000	148000	Okay, yeah, trust me, I don't take that for granted.
148000	151000	I'm very lucky to be able to go, but it is very tiring.
151000	152000	And if you were here, you'd say the same thing.
152000	153000	It's like, shit, I'm exhausted.
153000	155000	You know, I'm craving some Ridge Racer 6
155000	159000	since they didn't have Ridge Racer 7 at PlayStation or Namco's booth this year,
159000	161000	except for a video.
161000	162000	I know, kind of disappointing, huh?
162000	164000	I don't know why I'm craving it.
164000	165000	I just need to play it.
165000	167000	The craving is there. The itch is there.
167000	168000	I'm craving tacos.
168000	172000	Quick programming note, you guys, for you Orange Lounge Radio fans.
172000	176000	There will be no live program this Sunday, which is Mother's Day.
176000	179000	So spend some extra time with your mother
179000	181000	or, you know, motherly figure in your life,
181000	183000	the politically correct term there.
183000	185000	Or catch up on the free podcast that we had.
185000	187000	There you go.
187000	191000	Unfortunately, we've just, we got other stuff going on due to the holiday
191000	194000	and, you know, just the fact that we're driving home from E3 and all that.
194000	196000	So we hope our listeners will understand,
196000	199000	but we'll be back, of course, our normal time next Sunday.
199000	201000	We're just burnt out from the week.
201000	202000	A little bit.
202000	203000	A little bit.
203000	206000	I plan on playing that new game, Extreme Nap Action.
206000	208000	All right.
208000	211000	I'm going to the chat room there over at www, I'm sorry,
211000	213000	chat.allgames.com tonight.
213000	215000	I'm so used to plugging the other room.
215000	217000	Tonight, we're at chat.allgames.com.
217000	220000	Next week, we'll be back to the Orange Lounge Radio chat
220000	221000	over at orangelaunchradio.com.
221000	224000	You can always interact with us on our forums over there as well.
224000	227000	Reading chat right now, let's see, jaded2006 says,
227000	230000	LOL, there are so many video games.
230000	232000	How can you get sick of them?
232000	233000	Exactly.
233000	236000	Get back and read the first part of your sentence and then ask that again.
236000	240000	With so many video games comes so much walking
240000	243000	and so many lines, including those for food.
243000	246000	So sorry to tell you.
246000	247000	You know what?
247000	248000	What?
248000	251000	I actually didn't have a really long line for food.
251000	252000	It was much better this year.
252000	253000	It was only for coffee.
253000	254000	We landed off to the expo.
254000	256000	They did a much better job with food this year than last year.
256000	259000	I think that was because of the Wii line and everybody was in that.
259000	263000	The long lines were like for the grill and everything.
263000	265000	I'm like sandwich, tuna.
265000	272000	They had much more stuff set up outside this year,
272000	273000	which I thought was smart.
273000	275000	They had the barbecue grills like you were kind of saying
275000	277000	and all that stuff.
277000	279000	I think people started bringing food too, which is also smart.
279000	281000	They had some really healthy selections this time around.
281000	284000	I was very pleased because I don't do the meat thing.
284000	285000	They had tuna.
285000	286000	Good to hear it.
286000	289000	They had bagels and coffee.
289000	292000	Lots of coffee for me this weekend, this week.
292000	296000	Let's go around and play two interesting things tonight
296000	298000	because we have other topics we want to get to, so we can't do three.
298000	300000	We're going to do two interesting things tonight.
300000	303000	Dark Sakura, two interesting things you saw at the show today.
303000	304000	Start with one.
304000	307000	I had it in my head and it was in that issue of EGM.
307000	310000	I'd been reading down there and I completely forgot what it was.
310000	318000	So I'm going to say X-Deal by NCSoft.
318000	320000	That was very, very interesting.
320000	326000	It's like virtual on, but a lot more and it's going to be a free game,
326000	328000	a free download, free game through PlayNC.
328000	329000	I like free.
329000	331000	My ears perk up when I hear free.
331000	332000	They had a whole series of games.
332000	335000	Dungeon Runner, there was Smash Star, which they're going to rename.
335000	337000	It's already out in Korea.
337000	341000	And Soccer Fury, which was very, very detailed.
341000	346000	It was like hardcore beat everyone up soccer.
346000	347000	Very cool.
347000	349000	So you can't beat the price of free.
349000	351000	How did you enjoy the tour over there, that booth?
351000	352000	It was pretty cool.
352000	355000	The Guild Wars room was actually sort of like maybe I should play Guild Wars.
355000	358000	Because you bashed Guild Wars on this show before.
358000	359000	Not necessarily bashed.
359000	362000	It just wasn't fun for me when I played it before.
362000	366000	But actually better than that, I'm actually considering trying Tabula Rasa.
366000	367000	Very cool.
367000	373000	Because I like the whole sci-fi, kill aliens, shoot things, fun.
373000	376000	Guild Wars fans will be happy to hear the new expansions winning people over.
376000	378000	Loki, we're playing two interesting things.
378000	380000	What's one of your two?
380000	383000	Oh man, you know, I've been so lazy today.
383000	385000	You know, I know I played a lot of things today,
385000	388000	but I don't remember half the stuff I played.
388000	390000	God.
390000	393000	If you want to cheat, tell them something from Wednesday or Thursday
393000	395000	that we haven't talked about yet and they won't know the difference.
395000	399000	I guess.
399000	404000	I played, was it, okay Spore.
404000	406000	Spore was, you know, huge.
406000	408000	It was just an awesome looking game.
408000	411000	And not really much more I can say.
411000	414000	I mean, if you've watched the Game Developers Conference video of it,
414000	416000	it's basically that.
416000	424000	It's just, it's one of those games where I'm just going to sit there and destroy everything.
424000	429000	Create a race of vicious aliens that go and just decimate everything.
429000	431000	That's what I'm doing with Spore.
431000	433000	I loved Spore.
433000	434000	Loved it.
434000	436000	I mean, I was surprised.
436000	439000	I didn't know much about it going into the show today.
439000	442000	I know there's a lot of buzz, but I'm only one guy.
442000	444000	I can't follow everything.
444000	446000	So I wanted to go see it because of the buzz.
446000	449000	And even though we had a little problem at EA's booth trying to get in there,
449000	451000	but we won't go there,
451000	453000	we finally got into the Spore thing.
453000	459000	It was much more than anyone could possibly expect.
459000	463000	If you haven't been following this game, there is so much to it.
463000	467000	And so much of it has to do with the user, the way you build things,
467000	471000	and the way people that you know and random strangers in the universe build things.
471000	473000	It is so phenomenally impressive.
473000	476000	This is going to be the next Sims, honestly.
476000	478000	Which is not surprising.
478000	481000	I mean, it's Will Wright, but it's incredible.
481000	485000	I would be very interested to see if something like this comes out on a console, too.
485000	487000	Because I know right now it's only PC, right?
487000	489000	It's just PC, but...
489000	492000	They're saying DS and PSP as well, but...
492000	495000	There was a job posting about porting Spore to the DS.
495000	497000	It's kind of weird.
497000	501000	I think it would be a bastardized version, though, like those Sims.
501000	503000	It should really be on the 360,
503000	506000	or something that's really connected to the internet all the time.
506000	508000	Wow.
508000	509000	The Wii.
509000	511000	There you go.
511000	515000	Bobby, what's one of two interesting things you saw today at E3?
515000	517000	This is going to be a surprising one,
517000	520000	because I'm sitting here, you know, Nintendo fanboy and stuff,
520000	523000	and really bashing on Sony.
523000	527000	Interesting that I actually enjoyed Warhawk.
527000	528000	Really?
528000	533000	I actually played it, already to be able to be all bashing it and all that stuff.
533000	534000	I was having fun!
534000	537000	So what exactly was the demo like? What did you do in the demo?
537000	539000	Well, there was a single-player and a multi-player demo,
539000	544000	but I did the single-player demo just because it was near the end of the show.
544000	546000	Essentially, you just flew around shooting planes,
546000	550000	and then you had to shoot down four frigates and stuff.
550000	554000	The control scheme, it was no different for the people who were listening to radio.
554000	555000	You can't see me doing this.
555000	559000	If you have ever made a plane with your hand and just flown around and made the noise...
559000	561000	We all did that as kids.
561000	562000	That's what it felt like I was doing.
562000	564000	That's how I was flying the plane.
564000	570000	It's nothing like innovative or new or anything, but it was fun!
570000	574000	The graphics probably could have been better a little bit,
574000	579000	but the game was fun, and I was not expecting that going into it.
579000	580000	That's great.
580000	583000	The lines for Warhawk when I wanted to try and see it were really, really long,
583000	585000	so I didn't really get a chance to do it.
585000	588000	Yeah, I waited until the end of the last day, and there were two people in front of me.
588000	589000	I have to ask.
589000	592000	The controller, how did that feel?
592000	594000	How was that tilt controller?
594000	601000	It was very responsive on the movements for the plane, and it felt light.
601000	604000	It's a little light controller, and it felt fine.
604000	606000	It's just got some accelerometers in it.
606000	608000	That's all that's really got.
608000	610000	Interesting.
610000	614000	One interesting thing I saw today, or I should say one interesting experience,
614000	618000	was thanks to a listener of Orange Lounge Radio...
618000	619000	You guys rock.
619000	622000	...I got to cut the Wii line.
622000	624000	Wii!
624000	626000	Exactly, that's why I said Wii!
626000	630000	Justin from Vegas, if you're out there listening, I owe you my firstborn,
630000	633000	except I don't have a uterus, so I don't know how it's going to work.
633000	636000	I owe you so big, thank you so much.
636000	638000	It was totally a chance thing.
638000	640000	We literally ran into each other, and he's like,
640000	642000	I'm going to go see the Wii, and I think I get to cut in line.
642000	643000	You want to come with me?
643000	644000	I'm like, fuck yeah.
644000	648000	We went over, and sure enough, he talked to his person.
648000	650000	We were able to go in there. I was very happy.
650000	653000	The downside to that is that once you get in there,
653000	656000	it's still a bitch to actually get to play any of the demos,
656000	659000	so we just got to cut that four-hour line to wait to get in there.
659000	664000	We still had to wait in the lines once we got in there to play stuff.
664000	668000	I will say, I thought, well, I guess that whole experience is interesting,
668000	670000	but while I have the Wii brought up, this is why I played.
670000	675000	I played Excite Truck, which I thought was more fun than it looked in the preview.
675000	677000	I thought it was a fun time.
677000	680000	The graphics are nothing to scream at, but all the games are widescreen,
680000	683000	which made me very happy, so that's good.
683000	685000	It's a step up for Nintendo.
685000	688000	Also WarioWare, which was great.
688000	692000	It's a little tough at first because you have to keep changing the controller's positions,
692000	696000	but you get used to it, and I thought it was really cute.
696000	700000	I played the tennis thing as well, which I sucked at.
700000	704000	Justin floored me on that game with my ass, but it was fun.
704000	705000	Did you get to play Zelda?
705000	711000	No, lines were way too long, and I had to be back somewhere else.
711000	714000	That's too bad. That was actually the only one I had any interest in playing,
714000	715000	and I got right up there. It was great.
715000	717000	Lucky you. Lucky you.
717000	721000	I got right up there too, but I had a guy help me get up there too,
721000	725000	so we had the same experience on that one.
725000	727000	All right, let's do one more interesting thing,
727000	730000	and then we'll get into some of the best and worst of E3,
730000	734000	like best booth, best games, all that good stuff.
734000	736000	Dark Soccer, one more interesting thing.
736000	738000	I saw something that made me cry.
738000	740000	Okay.
740000	743000	That Bomberman Zero thing.
743000	744000	Ah, Bomberman Zero.
744000	746000	That was awful.
746000	752000	I mean, yeah, it plays like Bomberman, but it's too hardcore looking.
752000	753000	Bomberman's supposed to be cute.
753000	757000	I remember seeing those old Hudson Japanese commercials
757000	759000	where the person dressed up in the giant Bomberman suit
759000	762000	running all over the place being chased by the person in the other suit.
762000	765000	Did you play the Bomberman game on the Wii?
765000	767000	No, I didn't get to.
767000	770000	They had that thing tucked away in the corner.
770000	772000	But that made me sad.
772000	776000	That took a piece of my childhood and destroyed it in front of me.
776000	780000	It's like if they tried to do 3D Gem or something.
780000	782000	That just broke my heart.
782000	783000	All right.
783000	786000	Loki, one more interesting thing you saw at E3 today.
786000	789000	Elite Beat Agents.
789000	790000	That game is awesome.
790000	795000	It's just really fun to play, and it's got a really crazy-ass storyline.
795000	798000	This topic that came up on Bobby's show earlier,
798000	800000	for those that have no idea what the eff this game is,
800000	802000	what is this all about?
802000	807000	Well, originally it came out as, I think, Ouiden in Japan.
807000	810000	From what I gather, because I wasn't quite paying attention to the storyline,
810000	812000	trying to figure out how to play,
812000	818000	there's these three guys that just come and basically fix situations.
818000	822000	There was this guy, this girl babysitter,
822000	826000	who was trying to ask her boyfriend to go study with her.
826000	829000	Then the mom comes and makes her babysit.
829000	834000	So the Elite Beat Agents come to entertain the children to get them to go to bed.
834000	838000	And so it's got this art style and kind of a storyline,
838000	841000	almost like Phoenix Wright,
841000	843000	across with a little bit of Katamari.
843000	846000	It's just really off the wall, but it's fun.
846000	850000	It's easy. You just tap these circles on the bottom screen on the DS
850000	852000	with the beat of the music,
852000	855000	and there's a few other interactive things you can do with the touch screen,
855000	857000	but it goes all with the music, and it's really fun.
857000	860000	It's definitely going to be one of those classic games,
860000	863000	kind of like Guitar Man and Luminous and all that stuff.
863000	865000	Really good music games.
865000	867000	All right. Awesome.
867000	870000	Joining us, taking Bobby's place momentarily, Sam.
870000	872000	Nobody can take Bobby's place.
872000	874000	Well, maybe two of me.
874000	876000	Oh, no, no. We love Bobby.
876000	880000	But he just did a live show from the Outpost,
880000	882000	which you can check out at AllGames.com.
882000	885000	They're rebroadcasting a Sunday, right, I'm sure?
885000	889000	Your show will rebroadcast on Sunday, or will you be doing another show?
889000	891000	He's not going to do another show.
891000	893000	No. He's done for the week.
893000	895000	He's got a mom. He's got to visit.
895000	899000	So say hello to Scott Rubin, who's joining us from AllGames Interactive,
899000	901000	which airs here on AllGames.
901000	906000	Some of you guys might know Scott from his days at G4 Television.
906000	909000	And you were on a show there, G4TV.com.
909000	912000	Right. The show named after a website named after a TV show,
912000	914000	named after a TV network.
914000	919000	The brilliant, genius mind behind that was actually the CEO of the network.
919000	923000	I wanted to call it AllGames something, and he was like,
923000	926000	no, why don't we name it after the website
926000	929000	so that we can promote the website on the show?
929000	931000	No hard feelings, though, right?
931000	933000	None. I actually saw him.
933000	938000	I was at E3 on Thursday, sitting at the Sony booth,
938000	940000	getting ready to come here,
940000	942000	and one of the sales guys from G4 saw me and said,
942000	945000	hey, by the way, I just want to let you know, Charles is nearby.
945000	947000	Charles Hirschhorn together.
947000	950000	And Charles, you know, whatever, he got the network up,
950000	954000	but he kind of ruined a lot of the fun, creative stuff that people wanted to do,
954000	957000	so it was a very awkward moment. I thought I'd share that with you.
957000	959000	I'll say it, since I don't know if you can all say it.
959000	961000	G4 went totally down the toilet.
961000	966000	I mean, we get guys. What is that?
966000	974000	We get guys is a slogan that used to be the main slogan for West Hollywood here in California.
974000	978000	And they still get guys, so G4 is hoping that some of that will rub off.
978000	981000	Oh, well, more power to them. I don't know. We'll see.
981000	984000	But as a gay guy who's been to West Hollywood,
984000	987000	I'll say still not interested.
987000	988000	Still not interested.
988000	992000	They can't even win over the gays, so sorry.
992000	996000	Anyway, no, seriously, though, Scott, we've been playing a game here,
996000	998000	Interesting Things You Saw at E3.
998000	1000000	What was one interesting thing you saw at E3 today?
1000000	1002000	Interesting Thing I Saw at E3.
1002000	1005000	Interesting can be a game. It can be something you saw, anything.
1005000	1008000	Well, I'll tell you, it is an interesting thing I see at every E3.
1008000	1010000	I don't know if this is going to sound mean.
1010000	1012000	I don't mean to make it sound mean,
1012000	1018000	but it seems like if you're paralyzed or quadriplegic, you get into E3.
1018000	1023000	I see lots of people in wheelchairs that are not moving a lot.
1023000	1026000	They have almost no use of their arms and legs,
1026000	1030000	but I don't believe they work for retailers or the media,
1030000	1032000	but somehow they seem to get in.
1032000	1035000	Some of them even look very young under the 18-age limit.
1035000	1037000	But, see, now that could be like a make-a-wish thing or something.
1037000	1040000	Yeah, no, I agree. You said something.
1040000	1042000	Okay, it is interesting.
1042000	1045000	It's an interesting commentary.
1045000	1047000	Obviously, I'm not saying anything bad.
1047000	1050000	In fact, some of my favorite moments have been at E3,
1050000	1052000	especially when I was on the air at G4,
1052000	1058000	where I would be approached by a family member,
1058000	1063000	and they would say to us that he watches the show all the time.
1063000	1065000	He's a really big fan.
1065000	1068000	Gaming, and I've always said this, gaming is the great equalizer
1068000	1071000	because when you play an online game from home,
1071000	1074000	it doesn't matter if you're black, white, old, young,
1074000	1076000	male, female, handicapped or not,
1076000	1079000	when you're in that game, nobody knows who you are
1079000	1081000	other than your actions in the game.
1081000	1083000	I've always loved that about games,
1083000	1086000	that you could be anyone, literally, when you play games.
1086000	1090000	So it's always nice to see people who love games
1090000	1094000	and can get a chance to get close to the industry like that
1094000	1096000	and see how they experience it.
1096000	1098000	I mean, you guys have been to E3 before,
1098000	1101000	so you kind of take it for granted after a while,
1101000	1103000	but it is fascinating.
1103000	1106000	I watched a couple of people come in just the past couple of days,
1106000	1109000	and their eyes light up as if they've entered Disneyland.
1109000	1110000	Oh, that was me the first year.
1110000	1113000	I don't know, Dark Soccer, was that you the first year?
1113000	1115000	I had sort of an idea of what to expect
1115000	1119000	because my friend, who's another GameStop manager,
1119000	1121000	he brings us a video every year.
1121000	1123000	So I sort of had an idea of what to expect,
1123000	1126000	but my first year, it's like going and seeing everything so big,
1126000	1128000	I was like, where to first?
1128000	1131000	Yeah, it's overwhelming the first year.
1131000	1133000	Which meant camping out at Konami for two hours.
1133000	1135000	You've got to have a plan, I've found that.
1135000	1137000	You've got to have a plan, you've got to have comfortable shoes.
1137000	1138000	Amen.
1138000	1140000	And you've really got to have a plan.
1140000	1145000	Now, I have not been a part of your live broadcast before.
1145000	1147000	Sky refusing to look at chat,
1147000	1150000	he refuses to acknowledge the people in the chat room?
1150000	1151000	Oh, no, they're there.
1151000	1153000	I mean, they're just not saying anything interesting.
1153000	1156000	And Loki, you also, you don't even bring chat up.
1156000	1157000	No.
1157000	1160000	Loki doesn't even, usually I do, but Loki hates chatters.
1160000	1161000	He hates chatters.
1161000	1164000	That's not quite an actual Wonder Woman outfit.
1164000	1166000	That's not a Wonder Woman outfit?
1166000	1169000	Well, no, because Wonder Woman, that's a bikini.
1169000	1170000	Oh, you know something, you're right.
1170000	1173000	That could be the reason behind it all.
1173000	1174000	Yeah, that's why she got kicked out.
1174000	1176000	Wonder Woman had a full...
1176000	1178000	Right, right.
1178000	1179000	There you go.
1179000	1181000	Okay, you want to know why I'm not reading chat?
1181000	1182000	Here's the comment right now.
1182000	1184000	Who said Tommy Tallarico?
1184000	1186000	I think somebody's very confused about who's on the show right now.
1186000	1187000	I have no idea.
1187000	1189000	That's why I'm not reading chat.
1189000	1191000	All right, well, you've actually got a good point there.
1191000	1192000	Now, what is it?
1192000	1194000	Paris Hilton doesn't know the name of her own game?
1194000	1195000	Yeah.
1195000	1196000	Loki, what is this?
1196000	1198000	It was funny because she showed up late yesterday
1198000	1201000	and she ended up calling her game, which I believe...
1201000	1204000	I don't even remember what it's called now, but...
1204000	1206000	I don't know.
1206000	1208000	She called it, like, Diamond Quest or something,
1208000	1211000	and it's completely off of what the game is supposed to be.
1211000	1215000	Called Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam, and she called it Diamond Quest.
1215000	1216000	Yeah.
1216000	1217000	Well...
1217000	1218000	Who's expecting her to have a brain?
1218000	1219000	Yeah.
1219000	1220000	It's like she...
1220000	1222000	I don't even know what my game is called,
1222000	1224000	despite the fact that it's written right behind her.
1224000	1226000	Yeah, it's on the wall behind her.
1226000	1227000	You're assuming she can read.
1227000	1228000	It's also got her name in it,
1228000	1231000	so she went from calling it Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam
1231000	1233000	to just Diamond Quest.
1233000	1235000	Yeah, well, you know, that's what happens
1235000	1240000	when you hire a dumb, blond millionaire to promote your game.
1240000	1244000	You need to have someone poor and usually a gamer
1244000	1247000	if you want them to actually give credibility to your game.
1247000	1248000	Yeah.
1248000	1250000	I'm going to go ahead and try to wrap up
1250000	1251000	the two interesting things game.
1251000	1253000	One more interesting thing I saw today,
1253000	1255000	and, boy, so much to see.
1255000	1258000	What else would I say would be one more interesting thing?
1258000	1262000	Probably the use of Pac-Man arcade machines
1262000	1264000	to put the cell phone game in.
1264000	1267000	I thought it was a very interesting use of...
1267000	1270000	It's almost vandalizing, a classic piece of machinery.
1270000	1271000	But I suppose it's Namco.
1271000	1272000	They can do what they want with it.
1272000	1273000	That's true.
1273000	1276000	As somebody who used to be a huge pinball fan,
1276000	1277000	I will give Namco this.
1277000	1279000	I thought the baby Pac-Man machine being there.
1279000	1281000	You know, baby Pac-Man was the Pac-Man game
1281000	1283000	that was half Pac-Man, half pinball.
1283000	1284000	Right.
1284000	1286000	There will be pictures going up on our side of this machine.
1286000	1287000	Dark Soccer loves this, too.
1287000	1288000	We've been, like...
1288000	1289000	I've never got a chance to go back over there
1289000	1290000	and make an offer on it.
1290000	1292000	We've been co-hunting for, like, a...
1292000	1294000	She'll actually be able to afford it,
1294000	1298000	but I've been secretly wanting a baby Pac-Man machine for forever.
1298000	1300000	So it was kind of weird to see one there,
1300000	1303000	but you couldn't play it because they were advertising
1303000	1305000	the baby Pac-Man cell phone game on it.
1305000	1306000	Ah.
1306000	1307000	It actually wasn't even baby Pac-Man.
1307000	1310000	It was just Pac-Man pinball, which wasn't all that great.
1310000	1313000	I played quite a number of mobile phone games
1313000	1315000	over at Namco Mobile.
1315000	1317000	All right, let's go to chat room
1317000	1319000	because now they're finally saying something interesting.
1319000	1320000	You know I'm only giving you a hard time, Chad.
1320000	1321000	You know I love you guys.
1321000	1324000	If you want to join in, tonight we're in chat.allgames.com.
1324000	1328000	We are hijacking the All Games chat room
1328000	1330000	for our own evil purposes.
1330000	1332000	CKY Mike says,
1332000	1335000	Sky, anything about Resident Evil 5?
1335000	1336000	I don't think...
1336000	1337000	It wasn't on the floor.
1337000	1338000	I didn't see it.
1338000	1339000	Oh, yeah.
1339000	1340000	It wasn't on the floor.
1340000	1342000	I think there was a trailer,
1342000	1344000	but it was one of those...
1344000	1346000	It was like the Final Fantasy XIII trailer.
1346000	1348000	What did that tell you besides,
1348000	1351000	hey, it's being made and it's coming to the system.
1351000	1352000	That's it.
1352000	1354000	There really wasn't a lot of news on Resident Evil 5.
1354000	1356000	Well, there was a ton of games last year, too,
1356000	1358000	that they were showing at Square Enix's booth
1358000	1360000	that we didn't even see this year.
1360000	1361000	That's true.
1361000	1362000	So they disappeared.
1362000	1363000	Like what? Give us examples.
1363000	1365000	I don't remember what they're called now.
1365000	1367000	There's like a trilogy of games,
1367000	1370000	all of which I was not interested in.
1370000	1373000	Then also Devil May Cry 4.
1373000	1374000	I didn't see that at all.
1374000	1376000	It wasn't even shown.
1376000	1379000	What was really pissing me off
1379000	1381000	was the fact that Fatal Inertia wasn't on the floor
1381000	1383000	other than just video.
1383000	1384000	Yeah.
1384000	1385000	Wow.
1385000	1386000	All right.
1386000	1389000	Let's go around and give out some awards.
1389000	1391000	We're going to do our own personal assessments
1391000	1394000	for the best and worst of E3.
1394000	1396000	Scott, are you going to join in on us with this here?
1396000	1397000	Absolutely.
1397000	1398000	All right. Here we go.
1398000	1400000	Best game of E3.
1400000	1402000	I think last year we did two.
1402000	1403000	We did a runner-up
1403000	1405000	and the best game that you played at E3.
1405000	1407000	Using any criteria you want.
1407000	1408000	Absolutely anything you want.
1408000	1411000	And nobody can argue with you because it's your review.
1411000	1414000	So anybody feeling brave that wants to start with a runner-up?
1414000	1415000	Dark Sakura.
1415000	1418000	Oh, no. I don't know what my runner-up is right now.
1418000	1420000	Okay. All right. Loki, do you have one?
1420000	1423000	Yeah.
1423000	1426000	You know, this one I actually didn't play
1426000	1428000	because it was only a video.
1428000	1433000	But I'm going to have to go with Dead or Alive Extreme 2.
1433000	1436000	And why is this?
1436000	1440000	Because, sadly enough, I will probably buy that game.
1440000	1441000	Because he likes the boobies.
1441000	1444000	And I like the achievement points.
1444000	1445000	And he likes the boobies.
1445000	1447000	That's right. You're an achievement point whore.
1447000	1450000	Are you a fan of the Barbie dress-up mode, basically,
1450000	1452000	where you get to choose bikinis for the girls and all that stuff?
1452000	1454000	I just had to laugh at that game just by looking at it
1454000	1458000	because it's so blatantly...
1458000	1461000	It's like a Girls Gone Wild video.
1461000	1464000	Literally, they have that new series of Girls Gone Wild videos
1464000	1466000	that you see late at night,
1466000	1469000	where they're making them do games.
1469000	1471000	Well, that's basically this.
1471000	1472000	Okay.
1472000	1474000	I would say my runner-up, I'll go next.
1474000	1476000	My runner-up is Gears of War.
1476000	1479000	I thought Gears of War looked fantabulous.
1479000	1482000	What I also like about it is that it looks like they've designed it
1482000	1487000	so any dummy can do cool moves in it, which I think is great.
1487000	1489000	Even though I'm not a huge shooter fan,
1489000	1494000	I will go to that realm once in a while for a great, great shooter game like Halo.
1494000	1497000	And I think Gears of War is going to be one of those great shooter games
1497000	1499000	if the demo is any indication.
1499000	1502000	Plus, I love the way Microsoft had it set up, but I'll get into that later.
1502000	1504000	So Dark Soccer, you got one?
1504000	1506000	Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.
1506000	1509000	Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the PSP. Why?
1509000	1511000	Because it's Ghosts and Goblins.
1511000	1514000	I mean, that is like the peak of anything Capcom has out.
1514000	1517000	I mean, I love the old games.
1517000	1519000	And this does it so right.
1519000	1523000	It takes the best elements from the early games,
1523000	1525000	touches them up, makes it look really clean,
1525000	1528000	takes a little advantage of the PSP's resolution.
1528000	1531000	It was just really gorgeous. The play was great.
1531000	1536000	They've added to it just enough to where it doesn't ruin it by overdoing it,
1536000	1539000	but it just touches it up a bit. It was very good.
1539000	1541000	It was a very solid pla-
1541000	1544000	It's probably one of the first solid platformers I've seen in ages.
1544000	1545000	Alright.
1545000	1547000	Like, since the days of Planilla.
1547000	1551000	Excellent. Alright. Well, congratulations to Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.
1551000	1553000	Dark Sakura chooses you.
1553000	1554000	Scott!
1554000	1555000	I'm excited.
1555000	1558000	You know, I've been sitting here kind of like rolling to my head, you know,
1558000	1560000	and most of my thoughts have been,
1560000	1563000	well, I do have a lot of most surprising,
1563000	1566000	like, surprise me good and most disappointing.
1566000	1568000	But I'm gonna save those for my show.
1568000	1570000	I'm gonna answer your question specifically.
1570000	1572000	Best of show, there's no question in my mind.
1572000	1574000	Wait, you gotta do runner up.
1574000	1575000	Oh, geez.
1575000	1577000	Uh, oh, god.
1577000	1578000	Runner up?
1578000	1580000	Uh, yeah.
1580000	1584000	You know what? I'm gonna say, for runner up, I'm gonna say Saints Row.
1584000	1585000	Ah.
1585000	1590000	This is a game that, obviously, without a Grand Theft Auto title on the Xbox 360,
1590000	1595000	I'm looking for that kind of open-ended, hard-jacking, blow stuff up,
1595000	1596000	different kinds of weapons.
1596000	1600000	Obviously, what I like about Saints Row is that it goes another step further
1600000	1605000	and allows me to create anybody I want to be the main character.
1605000	1606000	And I really went for it.
1606000	1610000	I got the spiky here, big fat guy, and I could run around the city like that.
1610000	1613000	That's the one where you could be the girl or the guy, right?
1613000	1615000	I don't know if you could be the girl.
1615000	1617000	It's basically a gang type.
1617000	1618000	It's a THQ game.
1618000	1621000	It was at the Microsoft booth, and then right across from Microsoft booth,
1621000	1623000	they had, like, three or four demo stations there.
1623000	1625000	But it's, again, it's carjacking.
1625000	1627000	It's very similar to Grand Theft Auto.
1627000	1632000	It's made by Volition, the guys that did Red Faction and what was the other,
1632000	1634000	Free Space, Descent Free Space.
1634000	1636000	And it's well done.
1636000	1639000	I was always concerned because every time we've seen footage for this game,
1639000	1641000	it's been choppy.
1641000	1642000	The frame rate has been bad.
1642000	1646000	The word has been that it's not going to be ready, it's not going to be good,
1646000	1648000	and it's been delayed.
1648000	1651000	But my time with it was fun.
1651000	1652000	It definitely needs a little more work,
1652000	1655000	but I would say that is my runner-up for Best of Show.
1655000	1656000	Awesome.
1656000	1657000	All right.
1657000	1661000	Best of Show, the best game, damn game at E3, period,
1661000	1665000	using any criteria you want, Loki.
1665000	1666000	This is tough.
1666000	1671000	I know what you're going to say, so I'll have to say something else.
1671000	1676000	Also, there's just too much good stuff at E3 this year,
1676000	1682000	but if I had to pick one game, you know, Dead Rising, I love that game.
1682000	1687000	And I think it's just one of those games that I'm going to be playing for hours,
1687000	1688000	and I've said that over and over.
1688000	1691000	It's just very open-ended.
1691000	1694000	When you basically do anything, the game's only about three hours long,
1694000	1697000	but you can play it over and over and over and over again.
1697000	1698000	Give us a brief description of the game
1698000	1700000	because I don't think it's been brought up on the podcast yet.
1700000	1703000	Okay, well, Dead Rising basically is Dawn of the Dead, the game.
1703000	1707000	You play a main character who is this photojournalist,
1707000	1709000	and you're stuck in a mall with a bunch of zombies,
1709000	1712000	but you can kill the zombies in any way possible,
1712000	1714000	anything that's anywhere in the game.
1714000	1718000	In stores, you can pick up any item and just use it as a weapon.
1718000	1720000	There's like over 200 items.
1720000	1723000	You can customize your character and the way he looks.
1723000	1724000	You can rescue people.
1724000	1727000	You take photos of stuff.
1727000	1729000	It's just a really unique, different game.
1729000	1732000	I love it.
1732000	1735000	My Best in Show is one I think we've already talked about tonight,
1735000	1736000	but it stole the show for me.
1736000	1737000	It's incredible.
1737000	1738000	It's massive.
1738000	1739000	It's spore.
1739000	1743000	A game is phenomenal looking.
1743000	1746000	The only concern I have about it is I think it might be too much,
1746000	1749000	but the interactiveness, I love that stuff.
1749000	1753000	I love the fact that what your friends do can screw up your world.
1753000	1757000	I love the freedom to abduct aliens and then hurl them into space
1757000	1761000	and watch them fall crashing down to earth in a bloody pulp.
1761000	1763000	It looks like one of those games you're going to have the freedom
1763000	1764000	to do whatever you want.
1764000	1766000	It's going to be incredible.
1766000	1767000	Don't get me wrong.
1767000	1771000	I love PC gaming, but I would love to see a game like this on 360 as well,
1771000	1772000	if it's possible.
1772000	1773000	Maybe.
1773000	1774000	I don't know.
1774000	1777000	I just think it might be too massive for the confines of a console, though.
1777000	1782000	So PC gamers, you really are getting a good one with this one, spore.
1782000	1783000	Dark Sakura.
1783000	1785000	I'm going to go with Zelda, honestly.
1785000	1789000	I love the Zelda series, like almost every one of them,
1789000	1794000	with the exception of Majora's Mask and Wind Waker.
1794000	1798000	So this looked like it was really following directly in the footsteps
1798000	1807000	of Ocarina of Time, which was probably one of my favorites in the series.
1807000	1812000	Just having the Wii U-Con, or Wiimote.
1812000	1813000	The Wiimote, as I call it.
1813000	1814000	Yes, thank you.
1814000	1816000	The Wii-Con, as I call it.
1816000	1820000	You know, feeling the shake of the chain as you throw the claw hook,
1820000	1826000	hearing it impact, you know, hearing the twang of your bow as it flies back.
1826000	1830000	That is if you put the thing right by your ear.
1830000	1832000	The control was a little bit interesting to get used to,
1832000	1835000	but other than that it was, and it really didn't look like it was touched up
1835000	1839000	much more than the GameCube, but honestly,
1839000	1842000	everyone who listens to our show knows about how much I give a damn
1842000	1845000	about the graphics, which is like hardly any.
1845000	1847000	It was fun.
1847000	1848000	It was a lot of fun.
1848000	1851000	And probably the most fun of anything I played, you know,
1851000	1855000	next to Ghosts and Goblins, so that gets it.
1855000	1856000	Very neat.
1856000	1860000	That's an interesting choice because Zelda was such a huge game
1860000	1862000	at last year's E3.
1862000	1864000	Was enough changed?
1864000	1865000	Is it worth the wait?
1865000	1866000	There was quite a bit changed.
1866000	1872000	I didn't get to see the demo, but I had talked to plenty who did.
1872000	1873000	You mean last year, right?
1873000	1874000	Last year.
1874000	1876000	I had gone back and seen things later of it.
1876000	1879000	It looks like they've really cleaned it up.
1879000	1884000	I was actually just checking out that issue of EGM sitting over on the couch,
1884000	1888000	and they had a few side-by-side comparisons for The Twilight World,
1888000	1891000	where they had it sort of a monochrome color before,
1891000	1893000	and now they've gone through and touched it up
1893000	1897000	and added in different sort of ethereal effects to it,
1897000	1901000	muted some of the colors, oversaturated some of the other colors
1901000	1905000	to give it just a very alien feel when you're in The Twilight World.
1905000	1906000	And the difference was great.
1906000	1908000	I mean, of course, I didn't get to see any of The Twilight World,
1908000	1911000	but I got to see plenty of just the regular world.
1911000	1914000	Everything had real depth to it.
1914000	1916000	Instead of just saying, oh, this is 3D,
1916000	1918000	you actually got a real sense of depth to it.
1918000	1920000	I actually got a little motion sick.
1920000	1921000	So that was good.
1921000	1922000	All right.
1922000	1925000	Chat room wants to know, Derek H. is asking, is Scott asleep?
1925000	1926000	No, not at all.
1926000	1928000	You've got to be an exhausted guy, though,
1928000	1932000	with all this going on here at the E3 Outpost, which is awesome.
1932000	1934000	This is a great idea, by the way.
1934000	1935000	Thanks for having us.
1935000	1938000	And the E3 and all that other stuff, it's got a long week.
1938000	1940000	It's a little tiring, as you guys know.
1940000	1942000	I mean, you did the same show I did,
1942000	1944000	and you've been here just as much as I have.
1944000	1945000	So you're tired, too.
1945000	1947000	But it's all good, because evening is over.
1947000	1948000	But we get to leave tomorrow.
1948000	1949000	We do get to leave tomorrow.
1949000	1950000	All right.
1950000	1952000	Scott, your best of show.
1952000	1956000	I think people are going to be surprised that I love Viva Pinata
1956000	1957000	as much as I do.
1957000	1958000	Wow.
1958000	1959000	No, I'm kidding.
1959000	1960000	Oh, you bastard.
1960000	1962000	You bastard.
1962000	1966000	You have me going for a minute.
1966000	1967000	Not Viva Pinata.
1967000	1969000	Big shout out to Silent Wind there,
1969000	1971000	who has made the trek from Bakersfield.
1971000	1974000	I tried my damnedest to get him into E3, and I could not do it.
1974000	1976000	I'm very sorry about that, Silent Wind.
1976000	1978000	No, there's no question in my mind.
1978000	1982000	You've already said sport is the absolute best game at E3 this year.
1982000	1984000	Will Wright is a freaking genius.
1984000	1989000	We went into that little room, and I thought I knew pretty much
1989000	1991000	everything there was to know about the game.
1991000	1995000	I realized that all the creatures you find in the game
1995000	2000000	have essentially been combined with a trading card element
2000000	2002000	so that you can print out these trading cards
2002000	2005000	and play like a Magic the Gathering type game with it
2005000	2006000	off the computer completely.
2006000	2007000	Oh, I had heard.
2007000	2010000	The stuff they want to do with it is phenomenal,
2010000	2011000	those things they were talking about.
2011000	2017000	He also had inside the room creatures that were like action figures, statuettes,
2017000	2020000	and he made them with a 3D printer right from the game,
2020000	2024000	which I believe will be possible, to print out your creatures that you create
2024000	2028000	and make them into figurines that you can have in your room.
2028000	2030000	The Orange Lounge, when Loki and I went there,
2030000	2033000	we aren't cool enough to have Will Wright demo it himself for us,
2033000	2036000	so we got some other girl, but she was good.
2036000	2037000	We missed out on it.
2037000	2038000	You went into the little room?
2038000	2039000	Yeah.
2039000	2040000	I was surprised.
2040000	2043000	I was expecting it to be one of Will's minions, a little sim maybe.
2043000	2045000	We got a minion.
2045000	2047000	Oh, it was great.
2047000	2053000	I mean, he only showed the kind of third level and space level.
2053000	2055000	You didn't get to see the kind of amoebic level.
2055000	2058000	But what I think is so phenomenal about this, and you talked about it,
2058000	2061000	sharing the content, you know, anyone who knows SimCity
2061000	2064000	and the Sims knows that there is, like he says,
2064000	2068000	10% of the people who buy those games that make their own stuff,
2068000	2072000	and of that 10%, there's probably 10% of that that's actually really good.
2072000	2075000	The fact that instead of having to go to the website,
2075000	2077000	look through all the stuff and find it,
2077000	2080000	he's taking the best stuff and seeding it into the world on his own,
2080000	2083000	to me, is the most significant step,
2083000	2085000	because as you're playing the game,
2085000	2089000	it becomes populated by all this great content,
2089000	2093000	and so you encounter this creature, you attack this creature,
2093000	2096000	you can see who made it, find more of the creatures they've made,
2096000	2101000	and then the ability to go from amoeba to galactic outside,
2101000	2103000	millions of planets.
2103000	2106000	And when you think about how many units of Sims sold,
2106000	2108000	and how many units of Spore will sell,
2108000	2110000	a lot of game developers will say,
2110000	2113000	well, our community will be so big, we'll have so much content,
2113000	2114000	and usually there's nothing good.
2114000	2117000	You know that a well-right game will get the audience,
2117000	2119000	it'll get the customers, and it'll get the creativity,
2119000	2125000	and I think we're going to be playing just an incalculable amount
2125000	2127000	of creative characters and creatures in this game.
2127000	2129000	You know, when I was sitting there watching the demo,
2129000	2132000	I was almost saying, this is too good to be true, this is too ambitious.
2132000	2135000	But then I remember, oh yeah, there's like 20 Sims Expansions packs,
2135000	2138000	so, you know, anything's possible.
2138000	2140000	Yeah, and I do believe that you're right,
2140000	2144000	it is kind of so big that maybe people won't be able to kind of get through it,
2144000	2147000	and won't be able to get to all elements of it.
2147000	2150000	But that's kind of what I like about this game,
2150000	2153000	is that it is very open and sandboxy,
2153000	2155000	so you can just play around and create stuff,
2155000	2157000	you can play around in any of the levels,
2157000	2159000	but if you're a hardcore gamer,
2159000	2163000	and you're looking for the more than eight-hour black game experience,
2163000	2166000	you know, Spore will deliver probably,
2166000	2169000	it'll be on the World of Warcraft scale of gameplay.
2169000	2172000	I have no doubt it'll do well.
2172000	2176000	And if it doesn't do well, there's something wrong with the gaming community.
2176000	2178000	The only, you know, hint that it might not do well,
2178000	2180000	is you can look at Sims Online and say,
2180000	2183000	well, that was a well-right game, and it didn't do well, so.
2183000	2184000	Yeah, I guess.
2184000	2186000	But Sims Online was a dumb idea.
2186000	2189000	Sims Online just turned into Vegas, it was a bunch of hookers and drugs,
2189000	2193000	you know, there's just a couple key things that were wrong with it, unfortunately.
2193000	2195000	Anyway, let's keep it moving.
2195000	2197000	Worst game of the show.
2197000	2199000	Worst game of the show.
2199000	2202000	Anybody want to start off? Loki?
2202000	2207000	You know, I almost want to say Africa.
2207000	2211000	But, since I didn't get to play it,
2211000	2214000	I didn't really get to play this game either,
2214000	2218000	I think it's a stupid idea for a game.
2218000	2222000	The Eye of Judgment.
2222000	2223000	Worst game ever.
2223000	2226000	And the reason why is because it's not really a game,
2226000	2230000	and the fact that it reminds me of something that you would create
2230000	2233000	to kind of enhance a Magic the Gathering tournament.
2233000	2235000	Like something to throw on the TV,
2235000	2239000	if you were going to broadcast a Magic the Gathering tournament type thing.
2239000	2242000	That's about as useful as it is.
2242000	2246000	The fact that you have to remember to remove cards from the playing field
2246000	2252000	so that the PlayStation doesn't accidentally spawn the creature again is stupid.
2252000	2258000	My worst game of the show would be found over at 2K Games, this booth.
2258000	2264000	It's the new Family Feud game coming to, what, I think PlayStation 2.
2264000	2267000	And while granted there might be a market for the Family Feud game,
2267000	2270000	I had the Family Feud game on the Commodore 64,
2270000	2273000	and not a goddamn thing has changed.
2273000	2275000	Why would we need this?
2275000	2276000	This is so, I don't know.
2276000	2278000	The survey says you're right.
2278000	2281000	74% said you are correct, it's the worst game of the show.
2281000	2284000	Survey says this game sucks.
2284000	2287000	And the hosts have changed so many times.
2287000	2290000	I mean, if you're going to bring me a Family Feud game,
2290000	2294000	at least give me Richard Dawson trying to make out with the chicks.
2294000	2295000	They're all on that show.
2295000	2296000	At least give me that.
2296000	2298000	Who's the host? The guy that committed suicide?
2298000	2301000	No, some random guy.
2301000	2304000	I know on the real TV show, I think it's the guy from Home Improvement,
2304000	2307000	but I guess they couldn't get his likeness for the game.
2307000	2309000	Too expensive, I bet. His license is huge.
2309000	2311000	What a piece of poop.
2311000	2315000	And to think, that game was next to Dora the Explorer,
2315000	2318000	and I still named Family Feud.
2318000	2321000	All right, Dark Sakura, worst freaking game at E3.
2321000	2324000	Sonic the Hedgehog.
2324000	2325000	Which one?
2325000	2327000	The PS3 one.
2327000	2330000	Oh, Team Sonic rolling over.
2330000	2334000	And she is such a Sega fangirl that there must be some atrocities.
2334000	2337000	The control. The game was pretty.
2337000	2339000	And I mean, it was really, really pretty,
2339000	2342000	except for some of the jaggies on the PS3.
2342000	2344000	But you know, even the Xbox 360 one,
2344000	2346000	because I did go back and check that out,
2346000	2348000	the control was utter crap.
2348000	2350000	You turn it just, you know,
2350000	2353000	the best controlling version of Sonic Adventure was on the Dreamcast.
2353000	2355000	It was smooth, it was...
2355000	2357000	Why couldn't they have taken a page from the Dreamcast?
2357000	2359000	You know, they do it right.
2359000	2361000	They have it to where if you just
2361000	2364000	go a little bit to the left, drop the cliff.
2364000	2366000	And then on top of that, they have them,
2366000	2368000	the angle that they have them fall at,
2368000	2370000	you can see that the platform that you've been standing on
2370000	2372000	is just floating in the air.
2372000	2374000	He just falls into nothingness.
2374000	2376000	And as like, if they're at least going to do that,
2376000	2378000	have it from an overhead angle, you know,
2378000	2380000	and have them fade out, you know.
2380000	2384000	So, I could see there were a few collision detection issues.
2384000	2389000	The thing is, is that they can do a good Sonic game.
2389000	2392000	I mean, I played Sonic Rivals, that was fun.
2392000	2394000	But I have to call it the worst game
2394000	2396000	if they take something that I adore so much
2396000	2398000	and make utter crap out of it.
2398000	2399000	All right.
2399000	2402000	So, it gets worst game on control alone.
2402000	2404000	I'm sorry to hear it. All right, Scott.
2404000	2405000	So am I.
2405000	2407000	Worst freaking game at E3.
2407000	2409000	This time I'm not kidding when I say
2409000	2412000	people will be surprised when they hear me say this.
2412000	2416000	Madden for the PlayStation 3 was the worst game that I played at E3.
2416000	2420000	I have to tell you, if you're a PlayStation guy, girl,
2420000	2423000	and you're expecting to pick up a PS3 at launch,
2423000	2424000	and you're like Madden,
2424000	2427000	get ready to go through what we went through last year
2427000	2429000	with the Xbox 360 version.
2429000	2433000	From the words of an EA Sports employee,
2433000	2435000	the game will not work right.
2435000	2437000	They're just saying they haven't had enough time.
2437000	2439000	It's going to be just like the 360.
2439000	2441000	They still don't have final dev kits.
2441000	2444000	Madden has been completely rebuilt.
2444000	2448000	And when you rebuild and you try to let people in the house
2448000	2450000	you're rebuilding before it's done,
2450000	2452000	it's going to feel like it's not done.
2452000	2454000	And Madden on the 360 wasn't done.
2454000	2455000	He acknowledged that.
2455000	2457000	He said, you know, you're right, it was broken.
2457000	2460000	And he said it's going to be the same way this year.
2460000	2463000	And I would have thought all the work they did
2463000	2465000	since the release of the 360 version
2465000	2467000	would have carried over to the PS3.
2467000	2468000	But unfortunately, no.
2468000	2471000	The best thing about Madden really
2471000	2473000	is they've got 3D grass for the first time.
2473000	2475000	So if you're excited about 3D grass,
2475000	2477000	you'll be happy with the new Madden.
2477000	2480000	But otherwise, PS3 Madden,
2480000	2482000	it was the worst thing I've played.
2482000	2483000	It was a joke.
2483000	2484000	Wow, that's, wow.
2484000	2487000	Now we don't talk a lot about sports games on this show,
2487000	2488000	but even the...
2488000	2489000	You're allergic, right?
2489000	2491000	No, I mean, I like Blades of Steel.
2491000	2492000	Okay.
2492000	2494000	I like Tank Metal.
2494000	2495000	I like NBA Jam.
2495000	2496000	Those are good games.
2496000	2497000	Here's the thing, though.
2497000	2498000	What I'm curious about,
2498000	2500000	even the non-sports games fans
2500000	2502000	are interested in Madden on the Wii.
2502000	2504000	I'm curious, what are your thoughts,
2504000	2507000	sports game fan of Madden on the Wii?
2507000	2508000	Well, I'll tell you,
2508000	2510000	all the sports games on the Wii
2510000	2513000	are going to benefit from the fact that
2513000	2516000	we've been pushing buttons for sports games for years.
2516000	2518000	And I found the novelty
2518000	2521000	of using the controllers really enjoyable.
2521000	2524000	I found it to be a new challenge in the game.
2524000	2527000	Instead of just adding a vision cone to a game,
2527000	2529000	I found throwing the ball,
2529000	2532000	like using the motion of throwing a ball,
2532000	2533000	was really kind of cool,
2533000	2535000	and it really appealed to me.
2535000	2539000	I think that they've just kind of begun to tip the iceberg
2539000	2541000	of what's possible
2541000	2543000	in terms of unique gameplay elements
2543000	2545000	with this special controller.
2545000	2546000	And I have to say,
2546000	2549000	I was surprised that it didn't feel cheesy, gimmicky,
2549000	2551000	even at this early stage.
2551000	2555000	I think graphically it'll be able to be decent enough
2555000	2557000	that it won't be a disappointment to people
2557000	2559000	who are kind of used to the graphics they have.
2559000	2561000	But I have to tell you,
2561000	2565000	I think that if you can lock in the Wii controller
2565000	2568000	into the kind of sports games we're used to,
2568000	2571000	whether it be hockey from the guys at 2K Sports,
2571000	2576000	or baseball from the guys at 2K, or EA even,
2576000	2579000	and what I'd really like to see is a boxing game use the Wii,
2579000	2581000	I think people who are sports fans
2581000	2584000	are going to be ready to make this jump.
2584000	2585000	Because, let's face it,
2585000	2589000	for years we've been playing sports games the exact same way.
2589000	2593000	And just watching the guy play baseball with the Wii controller,
2593000	2594000	it made me excited.
2594000	2597000	Graphically, I think the Nintendo sports games,
2597000	2599000	they need to evolve a little.
2599000	2602000	I'm a little tired of these cutesy little Japanese characters
2602000	2604000	for my baseball games and my tennis games.
2604000	2608000	I'd like to see some realistic players here in 2006.
2608000	2610000	But the Miyamoto in tennis was hilarious.
2610000	2611000	You have to admit it.
2611000	2612000	Oh, the faces.
2612000	2614000	That was the best part of the press conference.
2614000	2619000	Reggie Fils-Aime, Iwata, and Shigeru Miyamoto
2619000	2622000	on the faces of those characters.
2622000	2625000	Clearly the show-stealer at the Nintendo press conference.
2625000	2626000	Way too cute.
2626000	2627000	That was pretty adorable.
2627000	2628000	Let's go around.
2628000	2630000	Best booth, worst.
2630000	2633000	Well, let's start with best booth using any criteria you want.
2633000	2636000	Best booth using any criteria you want.
2636000	2638000	It can be designed, it can be what was in it,
2638000	2640000	it can be the way the staff treated you.
2640000	2641000	Any criteria you want.
2641000	2643000	Loki.
2643000	2646000	I would have to say Sega's booth was probably the best booth
2646000	2648000	that I played at, at least.
2648000	2652000	I like flat-out, or not flat-out, full-auto, too.
2652000	2657000	And I love being able to play multiplayer in ChromeHounds.
2657000	2659000	So I think they had a really good setup.
2659000	2661000	The videos were everywhere.
2661000	2665000	So I liked it, and they were giving away lots of stuff.
2665000	2667000	So yeah.
2667000	2670000	Dark Sakura, best booth at E3?
2670000	2673000	Uh...
2673000	2677000	I'm really not sure, because I wasn't particularly wowed.
2677000	2679000	I guess I'm going to, even though I really disliked their layout,
2679000	2681000	I'd go with Nintendo.
2681000	2685000	Just because it was pretty.
2685000	2688000	And I did like how they had the...
2688000	2690000	You know, I'm actually going to strike that back.
2690000	2693000	I'm going to say the PSP area for Sony.
2693000	2694000	Okay, so like the PSP booth?
2694000	2695000	I liked the couches.
2695000	2697000	You could sit down, and your feet were like,
2697000	2699000	I'm sitting down.
2699000	2702000	You know what, the way you played those PSP demos was very interesting.
2702000	2703000	I know.
2703000	2705000	That's how I sit on my couch and play, sort of half sideways.
2705000	2707000	But I thought that it was a neat...
2707000	2709000	It was easy to get to everything.
2709000	2713000	You were crowded, like a bunch of rats in a cage.
2713000	2716000	It was just all like, I've got room to breathe.
2716000	2717000	I can sit down.
2717000	2719000	This is a fabulous idea.
2719000	2722000	So yeah, I'm going to actually go with Sony,
2722000	2723000	for just the PSP area.
2723000	2724000	All right.
2724000	2726000	Best booth for me.
2726000	2729000	I can't believe I'm about to say this.
2729000	2733000	Because three years ago, this would never...
2733000	2736000	Best and this company would have never come out of my mouth.
2736000	2738000	But times have changed so much,
2738000	2743000	and this year's E3 proved that Microsoft has got the best booth to show.
2743000	2745000	I would agree with it.
2745000	2749000	Microsoft is in such an interesting position right now,
2749000	2751000	because they do have a year ahead.
2751000	2757000	And every problem I had with the Xbox, they got it this time.
2757000	2760000	There is something for the role-playing fans.
2760000	2762000	Enchanted Arms looks great.
2762000	2764000	There is something for the cutesy people.
2764000	2766000	Viva Pinata.
2766000	2768000	Well, okay, maybe there'll be something else next year.
2768000	2772000	There is something for sports people, action people.
2772000	2777000	And the way the booth was laid out was smart.
2777000	2780000	Their demonstration was inside a little room.
2780000	2783000	The Gears of War thing, where the floor vibrated.
2783000	2785000	You got your ticket, you came back.
2785000	2787000	I'm sorry, you put headphones on.
2787000	2789000	I'm just so excited.
2789000	2794000	But Microsoft, the people would come up and talk to you.
2794000	2796000	Did not judge you based on your credentials.
2796000	2799000	Were happy and excited to tell you about the game.
2799000	2803000	I'm so surprised at how far Microsoft has come.
2803000	2806000	By far and above the best booth in E3 2016.
2806000	2807000	I actually do have to agree with you there,
2807000	2811000	because I was impressed with the area they had laid out for DDR.
2811000	2815000	They gave you enough space to play that you're not face-up in front of the TV.
2815000	2816000	They sure did.
2816000	2818000	And also, Matt was actually pretty...
2818000	2823000	At the end of the show, they had these people walking around taking photos
2823000	2827000	and attaching it like little Polaroids and attaching it in a frame.
2827000	2829000	I talked to one of the girls over there.
2829000	2830000	She was just as friendly as she could be.
2830000	2833000	She said, oh yeah, Method Man just came by here
2833000	2837000	and talking about how some of the less savory people there.
2837000	2839000	We both agreed that we just like Pierce Hilton.
2839000	2842000	And now the chat room is getting a little angsty at me naming Microsoft,
2842000	2845000	because I think there's a lot of people still in that area
2845000	2848000	where they don't want to go over the Microsoft products yet,
2848000	2852000	because Microsoft hasn't done enough outside the realm of sports
2852000	2854000	and driving and stuff that's won them over yet.
2854000	2857000	I'm telling you guys, they're on the right path.
2857000	2861000	And don't get me wrong, there's even nice things about the PlayStation 3
2861000	2863000	and of course about the Wii.
2863000	2867000	But Microsoft is really in a good position right now,
2867000	2869000	and the booth itself was great.
2869000	2873000	It was not packed like it was a couple of years ago,
2873000	2877000	because they were more intelligent about where they put everything.
2877000	2879000	So it was easier to access things.
2879000	2881000	Just on all those levels, I'm considering it.
2881000	2883000	It's just great.
2883000	2885000	Scott. Oh, Scott took his headphones off.
2885000	2887000	I'm sorry, are you on your way out?
2887000	2889000	No, no, I just got an emergency phone call
2889000	2893000	just to tell me that they love the show.
2893000	2895000	Oh, thank you.
2895000	2896000	They were just calling in, they said,
2896000	2898000	I love the show that you guys are doing, keep it up.
2898000	2902000	Thank you, whoever that was, hello and thank you, appreciate it.
2902000	2903000	They're enjoying it.
2903000	2906000	All right, best freaking booth at E3.
2906000	2909000	I agree, Microsoft's booth was very good.
2909000	2915000	But it is, to me, hard to deny what EA is able to put together each year.
2915000	2921000	It's more about that Thunderdome and the way they put together that video.
2921000	2925000	It is kind of a lot of responsibility to be the first thing people see
2925000	2928000	when they walk into the big south hall.
2928000	2933000	And I think that EA, over the years, has evolved that booth.
2933000	2937000	It's very easy to see all of their games on display.
2937000	2939000	There's some stuff behind closed doors,
2939000	2941000	but the way it's set up with that circular movie room
2941000	2943000	so you can see all the movies,
2943000	2945000	game stations all on the inside,
2945000	2947000	a lot of playable stuff right on the inside.
2947000	2949000	And then outside on that outer perimeter,
2949000	2953000	again, very big, clear game stations.
2953000	2954000	For example, Superman today,
2954000	2957000	I was expecting not to be able to get any kind of demo,
2957000	2960000	but I stood there, watched him give a great demo to one person,
2960000	2964000	then he left and I got to get up close and ask a lot of questions.
2964000	2967000	And I just think that they've designed it really well.
2967000	2969000	It's clean, the way it's laid out.
2969000	2972000	I went into the little private area room with the NFL Network
2972000	2976000	and even back there, it was very nice.
2976000	2978000	The people were friendly,
2978000	2981000	and I just found that to be a good job.
2981000	2983000	And for God's sake, it better be.
2983000	2984000	They've got all the money in the world,
2984000	2986000	they've got a lot of big AAA titles,
2986000	2989000	and they've got the best spot in the entire show,
2989000	2991000	better than even the big three.
2991000	2993000	So I have to say, I thought the EA booth...
2993000	2996000	Now, I did want to jump quickly back to your earlier question
2996000	2998000	about most surprising,
2998000	3005000	because I remembered something that's right up the OLR alley in Kensha Hall.
3005000	3010000	I was checking out the Novant controller,
3010000	3015000	but across from them was a booth showing off
3015000	3019000	the world's first massively multiplayer DDR game.
3019000	3021000	I thought that was interesting.
3021000	3024000	I mean, it's too bad I couldn't understand it
3024000	3026000	because it was all in different language.
3026000	3029000	But I looked at it and I went, hmm, that's interesting.
3029000	3031000	I mean, I was shocked.
3031000	3036000	I was like, wow, there are people dancing together online all over the world.
3036000	3040000	I thought that was kind of shocking, surprising, and weird.
3040000	3041000	All right.
3041000	3044000	We've got to move it really quickly through these last couple topics
3044000	3046000	because we've got to make way for All Games Interactive,
3046000	3047000	which is coming up next, correct?
3047000	3048000	It is.
3048000	3049000	All right.
3049000	3051000	Well, let's real quickly, worst booth and why.
3051000	3054000	Worst booth?
3054000	3056000	That's really hard for me to say
3056000	3061000	because honestly the worst booth as far as its showing went
3061000	3068000	was I was really underwhelmed also by the PS3 area.
3068000	3070000	Sony overall gets best and worst.
3070000	3071000	Okay.
3071000	3075000	They get best for layout, worst for games.
3075000	3080000	I mean, true, they did have Tekken and Ghosts and Goblins,
3080000	3082000	but when you went up to the PS3 area,
3082000	3087000	I was surrounded by so much crap that it literally stank
3087000	3088000	and I had to get out of there.
3088000	3089000	All right.
3089000	3090000	Loki, worst booth?
3090000	3091000	Nintendo.
3091000	3092000	Why?
3092000	3095000	Nintendo's booth, you had to wait in a four-hour line
3095000	3099000	to get into another booth to where you'd wait another hour to play a game.
3099000	3104000	So it was a line to wait in another line to wait to play some games,
3104000	3106000	which were just tech demos,
3106000	3109000	and then the jackasses that were working on the demos there,
3109000	3113000	five minutes made quick, that type of stuff.
3113000	3114000	It was just very hurried.
3114000	3117000	They let people in, people weren't leaving,
3117000	3122000	so there's hundreds of people moshed in there like a club or something.
3122000	3125000	It just wasn't very conducive to being able to play the games.
3125000	3128000	The DS stations, as Bobby mentioned earlier,
3128000	3131000	none of the games were marked with what games they were.
3131000	3134000	You had to actually look over people's shoulders to see what they were playing,
3134000	3135000	which was stupid.
3135000	3137000	No GameCube games on the floor,
3137000	3140000	including the fact that they announced a couple games,
3140000	3145000	like the new Paper Mario game, which I wanted to play.
3145000	3146000	What else could be wrong?
3146000	3149000	No Game Boy Advance, but I don't really miss that.
3149000	3150000	One booth had Game Boy Advance games.
3150000	3153000	That was SNK, which was like one game.
3153000	3156000	But not even Nintendo was showing it, so let's do that.
3156000	3159000	I actually am really surprised that you said they were being rude
3159000	3162000	because the people I dealt with at Nintendo were nothing but brilliantly nice.
3162000	3164000	Actually, I had really nice people too.
3164000	3167000	That girl got me a Koji Kono's autograph,
3167000	3170000	and then the guy who was there at Zelda,
3170000	3174000	he was all helping me out with some of the controls until I got used to it.
3174000	3177000	We were just talking about old games and everything.
3177000	3179000	It was great. He was a really nice guy.
3179000	3183000	The one I was talking about in particular was the Red Steel demo.
3183000	3185000	It was a shift change.
3185000	3188000	The guy before him was letting these people play for 15 minutes each,
3188000	3191000	and then when I got up there, he was like, okay, five minutes, make it quick.
3191000	3192000	Wow.
3192000	3195000	I would also say Nintendo was the worst booth at E3,
3195000	3198000	and don't get me wrong, I love the Wii.
3198000	3200000	I mean, I'm going to buy the Wii.
3200000	3203000	I think it's awesome, but the design of the booth was shit
3203000	3207000	because when they did the DS, it was so much better.
3207000	3210000	You go in, they show the preview.
3210000	3214000	They have a set amount of time that you get to spend with the demos,
3214000	3217000	and there's incentive to go back through
3217000	3220000	because you may get to go to the demo room that has even more demos.
3220000	3222000	It was much smarter made that year.
3222000	3224000	I'm pissed that they didn't show anything on GameCube
3224000	3227000	because that Super Paper Mario, whatever it was, looks awesome,
3227000	3230000	and it's a crime that that wasn't on the floor.
3230000	3232000	It's sad that they're ignoring the advance
3232000	3235000	when they were pushing the micro so hard last year.
3235000	3236000	Nintendo made some...
3236000	3239000	Whoever designed Nintendo's booth should be fired for E307.
3239000	3242000	Bring back the old booth. Honestly, it was better.
3242000	3246000	And it's sad I'm making that judgment, not even based on the content.
3246000	3249000	And the fact that I dealt with some very nice people at Nintendo, it's too bad,
3249000	3252000	but the booth design cannot be ignored.
3252000	3255000	It was a horrible way to show the Wii.
3255000	3257000	Scott, worst booth.
3257000	3259000	Let's see, worst booth.
3259000	3261000	There's so many to choose from.
3261000	3264000	It's very difficult because I found a lot of these booths
3264000	3268000	to be poorly designed, poorly laid out,
3268000	3272000	poor choice of costume people.
3272000	3277000	You know, I think I'm going to say...
3277000	3279000	I'm going to say, I'm going to agree with you guys
3279000	3281000	that Nintendo was poorly designed.
3281000	3283000	I think they were in a tough position
3283000	3285000	because they knew everyone that goes to E307.
3285000	3287000	There's no way you leave E307
3287000	3290000	without having to at least try to try the Wii
3290000	3295000	because there's only, what, PC, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Microsoft,
3295000	3298000	and if you were to go back and people would say,
3298000	3300000	wow, you heard about this crazy controller, did you play it?
3300000	3303000	And you said, no, you're kind of a loser.
3303000	3306000	And the fact that they made it so difficult
3306000	3308000	and the fact that they didn't show a lot of the stuff
3308000	3310000	that people wanted to see,
3310000	3314000	yeah, I mean, you've got to say boo to Nintendo.
3314000	3316000	Boo.
3316000	3319000	Sorry, you know, I still consider myself a Nintendo fanboy.
3319000	3321000	Well, really, I'm a gaming fanboy. I like them all.
3321000	3325000	But Nintendo, that booth design, fire the architect.
3325000	3327000	Fire him.
3327000	3329000	Bobby wanted to interject something real quick.
3329000	3331000	Did anybody here say LucasArts?
3331000	3333000	Oh, no.
3333000	3335000	That's my runner-up.
3335000	3337000	That's my runner-up.
3337000	3339000	What are you hiding, LucasArts?
3339000	3342000	Who kept their booth closed for two days, then opened it up with a line.
3342000	3344000	Two and a half days.
3344000	3348000	They opened it up at noon today, then it was a line.
3348000	3351000	Who cares about LucasArts after that point?
3351000	3353000	It looked like it was a museum in there,
3353000	3357000	which means it was nothing more than a George Lucas ego inflation thing.
3357000	3360000	Yeah, but they had a video of people that worked there going,
3360000	3362000	the next generation...
3362000	3365000	What was the line? There was something about...
3365000	3368000	We will make the next generation game.
3368000	3371000	No, the video wall when you're walking towards West Hall.
3371000	3373000	Well, why don't you make it outside where we can see it?
3373000	3375000	Does that mean they haven't done crap yet?
3375000	3378000	Yeah, they always do that.
3378000	3381000	That's an elitist mentality, and that's LucasArts.
3381000	3384000	I actually have a category I'd like to ask everyone about.
3384000	3388000	Really quick, what was the most bizarre thing you saw?
3388000	3392000	The line of people to see Paris Hilton, get out of my E3.
3392000	3394000	Get out. What are you people doing there?
3394000	3396000	It is not a celebrity gawk fest.
3396000	3398000	Loki?
3398000	3400000	The strangest thing I saw...
3400000	3403000	I would have to say, because there wasn't too much weird stuff,
3403000	3406000	but at the very end as we were walking out,
3406000	3410000	there was some impromptu dance party going on in the Engage booth,
3410000	3412000	and I don't know what that was about.
3412000	3413000	That was horrible.
3413000	3416000	Despite the fact I bashed on the Engage an awful lot,
3416000	3418000	their booth was actually pretty slick.
3418000	3421000	I couldn't go in. It was almost like I was Superman and it was Kryptonite.
3421000	3423000	I would try to walk towards the Engage booth,
3423000	3425000	and I physically was pushed backwards.
3425000	3428000	I used it to cut through to get around the massive Konami,
3428000	3430000	people watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer.
3430000	3432000	But you know what? The booth design was slick.
3432000	3436000	I still hate the Engage, but the design is slick.
3436000	3437000	They tried to sell it really well.
3437000	3439000	You're reminding me too much of the Apple Store.
3439000	3441000	Alright, you.
3441000	3444000	My most bizarre thing was WTF.
3444000	3447000	Oh, yeah, the work task fund or whatever.
3447000	3449000	Work time fund.
3449000	3453000	That's just because it's something really bizarre about cutting a rabbit in half
3453000	3456000	and then having this old lady bring out incense and start praying
3456000	3458000	and getting paid for it.
3458000	3459000	Alright.
3459000	3461000	Scott, really quickly, you got one you want to add?
3461000	3464000	Okay, my weird thing was two things.
3464000	3468000	One, those stupid inflatable rafts people were wearing on the back.
3468000	3474000	To see people in suits walking around with webs and inflatable rafts on their back,
3474000	3479000	I just wanted to push them so that they'd fall and bounce and bounce back up.
3479000	3481000	I just wanted to do that all day.
3481000	3483000	Worst giveaway I've ever seen.
3483000	3489000	And the other thing is these hordes of people that stand in line for ridiculous things.
3489000	3491000	Now, okay, I like Adam West.
3491000	3493000	I just don't understand wasting.
3493000	3495000	The show is three days.
3495000	3498000	Two and three quarters because the last day is short.
3498000	3502000	Why are people spending their time waiting in lines,
3502000	3507000	A, to see old celebrities or even like a Paris Hilton, like you said,
3507000	3515000	and B, to get a small little trinket of something that you will probably lose very quickly
3515000	3517000	or never use in your life.
3517000	3519000	If it's something cool, I'm all about it.
3519000	3524000	But I see people waiting as though they're going to receive communion from the pope or something.
3524000	3527000	It's just very, very bizarre.
3527000	3533000	Along the same lines, why do they go stand behind G4's booth to try and get on TV?
3533000	3536000	Like every day we were leaving, we'd see this crowd of people going,
3536000	3539000	And just to let you in on a little secret, I actually walked by and went,
3539000	3541000	Boo!
3541000	3542000	I mean, it's just weird.
3542000	3544000	I'm petty, I'm sorry.
3544000	3548000	You know I don't like the direction that channel went into.
3548000	3555000	Why are people going to the G4 booth at E3 to watch coverage of E3?
3555000	3558000	I know, I know. Anyway, we've got to wrap it up.
3558000	3560000	Thank you guys. This was a great show.
3560000	3563000	Scott Rubin, thank you so much for joining us on tonight's program.
3563000	3567000	You guys are welcome back here anytime, any day.
3567000	3570000	It's been a pleasure to have. It's been a lot of fun.
3570000	3573000	And like I said to you earlier before the show,
3573000	3575000	anybody who's got a passion for gaming,
3575000	3577000	and you guys have been doing this show so long,
3577000	3579000	it's a real testament to your passion for gaming,
3579000	3582000	and your audience is a lucky group of people,
3582000	3586000	and I'm glad the All Games crew has had a chance to experience OLR live from E3.
3586000	3587000	Thank you.
3587000	3588000	And you know what, Scott?
3588000	3589000	Thank you so much.
3589000	3592000	You know, I would have never thought having four years ago
3592000	3597000	that we would be sitting here with somebody who has been to the ends of gaming media,
3597000	3599000	you know, on the TV and stuff.
3599000	3600000	This is surreal.
3600000	3601000	Thank you so much for having us.
3601000	3602000	This is awesome.
3602000	3603000	Thanks for coming.
3603000	3604000	All right.
3604000	3606000	Bobby, thank you so much for being here as well.
3606000	3608000	We appreciate it, your three days of hard work on the program.
3608000	3611000	Yeah, well, no, actually, and what I wanted to say is, you know,
3611000	3613000	that I really appreciate being here.
3613000	3615000	A lot of your people listening probably don't know.
3615000	3618000	I was listening to Orange Lounge Radio before they started podcasting.
3618000	3622000	I had listened to some of their live shows before the whole podcasting fact,
3622000	3626000	and then I was listening to their podcast before I was doing a show.
3626000	3631000	So for me as a fan, it's been a thrill to be able to be up here with the guys.
3631000	3634000	A lot of listeners probably would kill to have, you know,
3634000	3635000	be able to sit at least for one show.
3635000	3636000	I got two.
3636000	3638000	I got two shows with the OLR guys.
3638000	3643000	So thank you, and thank you to the OLR chatters for welcoming me and the family.
3643000	3645000	It was kind of really weird today when people were asking me,
3645000	3647000	please be on the show again today.
3647000	3648000	Move to Sacramento.
3648000	3649000	We'll talk about it.
3649000	3650000	All right.
3650000	3651000	All right.
3651000	3652000	Thank you.
3652000	3655000	I really would like to thank our OLR me for showing up in force.
3655000	3657000	Yeah, you guys are awesome.
3657000	3660000	I was very impressed to see so many people.
3660000	3663000	And it was cool to meet some of you at E3 also.
3663000	3664000	Yeah, I met up with a few people.
3664000	3665000	And Justin.
3665000	3666000	Oh, my gosh.
3666000	3667000	Oh, my gosh, Justin.
3667000	3670000	You don't even know how bad I owe you.
3670000	3673000	Bandit in chat says, support all games.
3673000	3676000	Kill G4, damn posers.
3676000	3679000	Interesting comment.
3679000	3680000	You know what?
3680000	3684000	If you want the real gaming media, you're going to have to go to the internet.
3684000	3685000	I agree with that.
3685000	3686000	All right.
3686000	3687000	Let's wrap it up.
3687000	3688000	Final, final thoughts.
3688000	3689000	Final thoughts of E3.
3689000	3692000	Scott, do you want to get indulged with the final thought?
3692000	3696000	Final thoughts of E3, you know, every year we get very excited looking up to it.
3696000	3704000	I think this year, because it is a transition year, I think I'm so shocked at how disappointing
3704000	3710000	Sony's showing was that I almost don't feel the same as I ever have, believing in E3 before.
3710000	3713000	Obviously, those movies last year left us on such a high point.
3713000	3714000	We couldn't believe it.
3714000	3715000	Is it real?
3715000	3716000	Is it real?
3716000	3720000	In this year, the reality feels like a really wet towel smacking me in the face.
3720000	3727000	But being a guy that went out and got a 360, it just kind of shows that sometimes when
3727000	3732000	you are there on day one to adopt a new technology, it pays off in the end.
3732000	3735000	And so I'm glad I have a next-gen system.
3735000	3736000	I don't feel like I got burnt.
3736000	3740000	And hopefully Sony will surprise us when they release this machine in November.
3740000	3741000	All right.
3741000	3743000	Bobby, final thought.
3743000	3745000	I'm ready to go home.
3745000	3747000	Loki, final thought.
3747000	3748000	Man, this is weird.
3748000	3753000	I don't really want to leave here, because I swear, having come here like every day this
3753000	3756000	week, it feels like a second home almost.
3756000	3757000	It's just, I don't know.
3757000	3760000	I need more plasma screens in my house, I think.
3760000	3761000	Your new wife missed you.
3761000	3764000	That was the first thing we did when we moved into our house.
3764000	3766000	I haven't seen this kind of emotion from him all week.
3766000	3767000	I know.
3767000	3768000	This is crazy.
3768000	3769000	All right.
3769000	3770000	Well, I'm sorry.
3770000	3771000	I've been kind of buried in a laptop all week.
3771000	3772000	You really have.
3772000	3773000	But E3 on PSP, how's that been?
3773000	3774000	A success?
3774000	3776000	Did you call it a success?
3776000	3778000	It's as good as one person can do, so.
3778000	3779000	There you go.
3779000	3780000	Maybe next year we'll have a set.
3780000	3781000	Next year you'll have a bigger crew.
3781000	3782000	All right.
3782000	3783000	My final thought, and then we'll let Dark Sakura go.
3783000	3787000	My final thought would be, I was dissing on the chat room earlier, but secretly, I love
3787000	3788000	you guys.
3788000	3791000	You guys are the reason why we do this show.
3791000	3794000	I mean, not just chatters, but listeners in general.
3794000	3798000	I mean, just the feedback and the positive support we've gotten is just amazing.
3798000	3800000	So, thank you so much.
3800000	3801000	And that's that.
3801000	3802000	We'll see you at E307.
3802000	3803000	Dark Sakura.
3803000	3804000	Rejects false icons.
3804000	3805000	Say no to Sony.
3805000	3806000	All right.
3806000	3807000	Wow.
3807000	3808000	That's some harsh words.
3808000	3809000	I don't know.
3809000	3813000	I don't hate Sony, but we'll get into that on another show.
3813000	3814000	But not next week.
3814000	3817000	No OLR this Sunday.
3817000	3819000	We will be back next Sunday.
