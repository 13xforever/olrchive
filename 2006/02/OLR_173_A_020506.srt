00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,960
Today, February 5th, 2006, new details emerge on the PlayStation 3, do American games always

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,960
fail in Japan and a special ode to Kingdom Hearts.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,400
host mr. ferret and that's it we fired the other two no just kidding say hello

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,520
to dark Sakura Jamie summers I got a ferret me yes you do it would it send

5
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,240
your burrito was the name of the fair in your burrito your burrito one night I

6
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:20,440
fed my ferret some beer say hello also to z1 and only Loki hi how you doing bad

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Bad Rob! Bad Rob. Printer sucks.

8
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,440
Let me set up a little background. I know we're a video game show, but let's face it,

9
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
we gotta talk about our personal lives once in a while too.

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Okay, I just bought a cheap printer today because for work I'm going down to L.A. on Monday

11
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
and I have to fly out at six o'clock in the morning.

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Well, I'm flying Southwest. You know how Southwest has those, like, boarding pass systems where

13
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,440
depending on what time you print your boarding pass from the internet, you get an A, B, or C pass, right?

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
So I bought a printer so I could have myself an A pass.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,880
Well, I screwed up. I thought you couldn't print your passes until after midnight and then like literally 30 minutes before the show

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,280
I realized oh crap. You can actually print them up to 24 hours in advance

17
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,880
so I'm hooking up the printer in this furious frenzy and

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,840
Now the damn thing won't even print and Loki stuck over there because I have his computer frozen up with the boarding pass sitting

19
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,080
Yeah, because because this wonderful printer that you bought didn't come with a black cartridge because that would have been too expensive and the prayers

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,920
Like no, I don't want to prove that black cartridge. Fuck you. That's what it's saying

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,440
So now I'm gonna have to leave that up and try to run and get a black cartridge after the show

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,120
so I can have my stupid boarding pass.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,840
And here I brought Kingdom Hearts 2.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,880
I know, and I totally missed a chance to check it out before the show

25
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,720
because I made a mistake in Southwest's stupidy-doopity policies.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
Maybe we could look at it during the break.

27
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm getting the look of disbelief, so...

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,720
Yes. Oh, say hello to, joining us in our fourth chair tonight,

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,280
say hello to somebody who also has a show here on Orange Launch Radio.

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Say hello to Extofer.

31
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,640
Hey, Rob Ofer.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,520
How you doin'?

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Not bad. And you?

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Good. First time on the podcast.

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
My podcast debut.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
How you doing?

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
I'm doing well. You asked me that.

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Already. But I'm well now.

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm a little flustered, okay?

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm under a tad bit of stress

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
because now I'm like, shit, what if that boarding pass

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
gets lost? I'm gonna cry.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
That would be funny. I mean, it would be sad.

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
No, it would not be funny. Then I'd be stranded and my boss would murder me.

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Yeah, it'd still be funny.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Anyway.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,840
let's not talk about my personal crisis is for a minute let's talk about

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,040
our gaming weeks and how that's been going I'll start off with the lovely

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
dark soccer with how was your gaming week I'm staring at the pretty precious

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,800
I have in my hands Kingdom Hearts 2

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,480
which I've been playing a little bit of enough to realize that Roxas

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,720
sucks and that I'm glad that I don't have to use him the entire game

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,280
um hmm it's gotta

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
it's very interesting it looks very very pretty on my TV

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,800
except it's still you know on the ps2 so it's

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,840
got jagged ease all to hell and back but the CG scenes look really pretty

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,880
I loves me some Kingdom Hearts yep

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,800
I've also been playing lots of Animal Crossing of course

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,720
and Dan picked up Maverick Hunter X

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,160
the Mega Man X remake and it's pretty damn cool

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,840
I mean it they completely redid the game for the PSP

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,680
it's fabulous and also if you beat the game you get to get this little sorta

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,040
OAV of how things led up to the situation

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,020
that actually the dubbing in it is not horrendous which surprises the hell out

65
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,500
of me

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,680
it's very very well done I'm very pleased and then you can play as a

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
The first guy that you fight

68
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,320
Whose name eludes me at present, but he looks like Boba Fett

69
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
And that's the Japanese copy video. Yeah. Oh the American one Wow

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
and

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,980
Maverick hunter Oh Maverick hunter am I yeah, I was wondering how I was playing it then

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,440
Purchased at a GameStop. No, no. No, I was talking about Kingdom Hearts

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,700
No, go back to the boarding pass Loki make it work

74
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,460
What about Kingdom Hearts is that's the Japanese? Yes, this is okay. Okay. I'm up to speed. This is the Japanese one

75
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,420
And how does that?

76
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
How is that?

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,460
Beautiful it was pretty but jaggedy. Well, yeah, I mean just you can understand it's it actually plays more like Devil May Cry

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,060
In fact you want to play this game on as hard of a level as you can or you will not level up high enough

79
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,740
to beat Zephiroth by the time you get to him because you have to fight and level a whole

80
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,760
lot to do certain things in this game but also you don't get to see a lot of the really

81
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,940
neat attacks if you're playing on the beginner mode because they all just die way too fast

82
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,620
it's like hit dead explosion and then a chain reaction where the others die for you it's

83
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,700
no so um I totally forgot the other games I played all week so because I played other

84
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:05,800
stuff I play the crap load of puzzle fighter on my gameboy micro which when

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,760
you're is sitting in a waiting room having your eye checked out after it is

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,840
swollen from an allergic reaction to a dog which I will be getting to later on

87
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,840
in the show and your eye is like in searing throbbing pain it's very hard to

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:31,600
look at a gameboy micro screen I tortured myself for my art alright my

89
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,120
eyes still looks like I got punched in it I didn't I didn't even notice I don't

90
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,640
oh okay a little bit it's not it's not as bad as it was Friday because I looked

91
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,280
like a Romero reject it was all like red bloodshot and then like that clear green

92
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,820
that they only give zombies okay so yeah I look like a Romero reject which means

93
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,140
we have to cut off her head no it's just you're nobody in this room is in any

94
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,740
danger of me eating their brain oh that's that's refreshing thank good I'm

95
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,960
glad yeah I love you guys all right we'll go over to extra fur how is your

96

only one that I've been playing is World of Warcraft and it's been pretty well

98
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,140
what what kind of characters do you have in World of Warcraft I have a night elf

99
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,140
a level 38 night elf

100
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
on the Malfurion server. And I also have a

101
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,180
level 29 druid on the

102
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,200
spine breaker server that I've been playing with.

103
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,220
And they are mucho fun to play with.

104
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
How are the guilds that you've been joining up in the game? Lots of drama.

105
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,260
I swear, I didn't know that all of this drama in

106
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,100
the world of video games existed but there's a bunch of drama queens in World of Warcraft

107
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,300
totally like like I I got invited to a guild not too long ago on the spinebreaker server

108
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,180
and they the leader kept on giving me gifts or whatever like giving me you know he was

109
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:12,300
enticing me with gifts and suddenly like last night I'm playing and I knew that there was

110
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,980
a little bit of drama it didn't have anything to do with me or anything like that in the

111
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,540
guild and two people were kicked off recently and then the leader himself

112
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,940
left the guy who invited me so I'm like you know I didn't even talk to anybody

113
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,660
really on that guild anyway and the guy the only guy I talked to was the guy who

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,900
was giving me things so I was like you know screw this guild and I left and

115
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,580

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:06,280
a lot as well as some more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories and a little

120
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,920
bit of Animal Crossing and that's pretty much it didn't play too much Call of

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,840
Call of Duty, really busy week so, lots of Ridge Racer though, I love that game.

122
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,560
I'm having a little bit of an off night tonight if you can't tell.

123
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,880
Haven't you had an off week?

124
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,840
Kinda, you know there's more drama, let me talk about my gaming week because there's

125
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
a lot more drama.

126
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,560
Yeah, what games have you not been playing Rob?

127
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
That would be anything on the Xbox 360.

128
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Oh wow, what happened?

129
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,380
Let me talk about what happened, I got my Xbox 360 this week, I did, I finally found

130
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,960
the Xbox 360 I used the Best Buy locator thing that we talked about on the show

131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,320
a couple weeks ago and I found out that a Best Buy had the Xbox 360 in stock so I

132
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
ran over there to Best Buy and they were out of premiums already at that point

133
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,780
but I managed to score myself a core system yes so I bought a core system and

134
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,440
the the clerk was really nice and she gave me it was really weird like she had

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,800
little slips of paper that had core written on it and the managers signature

136
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,120
and I had to take that up to the counter to get one of the core systems unlocked

137
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,440
out of the gate and get my little core system to take home and play. So, you know,

138
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:19,080
cool. And I picked up Cameo, or Cameo, I want to say Cameo, Cameo, and Dead or Alive 4.

139
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,740
So I got all that and I went home and I had a pretty good time with the Xbox 360.

140
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,500
I was playing Cameo a little bit. It's not quite the game I was expecting,

141
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,820
but it was, it was okay. It's kind of fun, I guess. It's a, it's a decent launch

142
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,660
title. It's a solid launch title. Then I was playing a lot of Dead or Alive 4,

143
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,580
That game was very sexy and you know lots of it's it's a beautiful looking game has lots of boobs

144
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:47,180
It does it has lots of boobs and the environments are huge. I love the stages in that game. It's so great

145
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,180
It's it's almost like free walking anywhere. I like the Mexican wrestler. Does he have boobs? She knows she

146
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,600
Yes, I like the all-american girl with the the the huge knockers. Yeah, Tina

147
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,080
I like her she was my favorite and her dad Hulk Hogan my my best my best character though was the geisha

148
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,960
Kokoro or whatever. She's she's the best her name means heart. That's right. So I'm the game they all had mega boobs

149
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah, they all have mega boobs. It's awesome. So anyway dead or alive for awesome. So pretty but um

150
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,280
Here's here's the problem is that oh and I download stuff on Xbox arcade to like joust which was awesome

151
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,580
I played Joust co-op online in battle, that was fun.

152
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,160
And I played, what else did I download on there?

153
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,720
Oh, Geometry Wars, which was a lot of fun too, you know, just like what everybody says.

154
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,420
That was all on Wednesday, I got the Xbox 360 on Wednesday, and Thursday I played a

155
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,480
little bit of it too.

156
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I went to my friend's house for a little bit on Thursday because he just moved into a new

157
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
place.

158
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
He was like, Rob, come over and see a new place.

159
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
I was like, okay, so I went over and we, you know, had dinner and stuff, and then I came

160
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,120
home and I'm like, okay, I want to play a little bit of Joust before I go to bed, so

161
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,260
So I power up the Xbox 360 and something doesn't look right on it.

162
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,220
It's flashing red.

163
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,060
Like one of the little lights in the lower right hand corner is flashing red.

164
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,680
I look at the TV and it says, System Error, Contact Microsoft Support, Code E74.

165
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,460
And I was like, the fuck?

166
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
I just bought this thing.

167
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,660
What the hell is wrong with it?

168
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,700
So I said, okay, you know what, maybe I just, maybe it's just a bad time, I'll just let

169
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
it rest.

170
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
I'll try it again.

171
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,700
So I let it rest.

172
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,900
unplugged all the cords replugged them all back in still didn't work I thought

173
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,320
okay maybe my systems not getting enough ventilation so I'll put it out in the

174
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,100
open okay unplug all the cords totally re-situate my Xbox 360 plug it back in

175
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,540
still doesn't work okay maybe my Xbox 360 is just being moody so I said okay

176
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,860
fine I'll try this again Friday when I get home from work so I tried again

177
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,660
Friday when I get home from work still nothing still broken not even a day and

178
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:57,500
and a half after owning my xbox 360 it broke and it has not worked since this is not this is not

179
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,220
one of those like reading it on the internet where oh look at some poor schmuck who their xbox 360

180
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,860
broke right off the bat it was me me my xbox 360 broke and i didn't do anything to it i didn't move

181
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,500
it between the last time i played it because i went to a friend's house came back and powered

182
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,740
it on the same place it was there was nothing possible i could have done to break the system

183
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:23,100
But you're a coke spilled on it. No, not even that don't and also the lemonade. No, nothing when I say lemonade. I mean

184
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Stop it anyways

185
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,380
No, I was just gonna say, um

186
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,220
You know, we're here when it all I know I know and your reaction was priceless because you were laughing

187
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,900
I was like, I thought you would be just like, you know scary, you know moody Rob

188
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,800
But you were actually like I can't believe this. I think it was disbelief or something like that you're like

189
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,300
Because like most of you out there

190
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,780
I'd read the stories on

191
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:55,420
Joystick and dig and Kotaku about you know oh these poor bastards their s box 360s broke right after they bought them and

192
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
happened to me

193
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,760
And now you have to wait for a box yeah, so I called so I didn't know what to do

194
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,300
I'm like okay. Do I take it back to Best Buy?

195
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,100
Well, what the hell are they gonna do they don't have any more Xboxes to give me

196
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,300
there's still the shortage going on. So I called Microsoft and I sat on the line

197
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,100
for you know a good 10 minutes and some rep came on the line and said yeah you

198
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,300
know you have a hardware error I'm like I can see that on the screen that says

199
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,820
it's a hardware I'm like I didn't do anything to this he's like well I think

200
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,500
like the only thing you're really gonna be able to do is send it back so we can

201
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,860
take a look at it and you know work on it and the whole process takes a week

202
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,980
because obviously they have this thing down to a science right now you know

203
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,780
they're fixing these broken Xboxes because apparently there's a ton of them

204
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,580
out there so I'm now waiting for a box to come to me from Microsoft so I can

205
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:48,860
send back my Xbox 360 so everybody out there do not play with the box no I take

206
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,860
what happened to me it's a lesson honestly think twice before you buy an

207
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,020
Xbox 360 because obviously Microsoft has tons of issues right now I'm sorry if I

208
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,740
sound a little bitter but I am because I spent like $500 my hard-earned money on

209
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,420
this system and the cords and the games all that garbage for nothing the damn

210
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,420
thing broke you know and I'm sure it says oh you know oh well you know it

211
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,340
happens that's what happens with a first-gen system Rob you should have

212
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,820
waited until you know it was a second wave no Microsoft shouldn't have put

213
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,340
this stupid system out on the market until the damn things worked and

214
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,420
technically it is a second wave or third wave or fourth wave yeah exactly right

215
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,220
now they've had how many months how many months I did nothing I I'm an

216
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,420
intelligent gamer I've been playing games since god knows when I know what

217
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,220
to do and what not to do with the system I know do not put a new system don't put

218
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,780
it on top of other things he can't ventilate I didn't do anything bad with

219
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,020
the system the system was faulty from the start

220
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,220
although I'm wondering though if it's not just something simple wrong with it

221
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,940
because usually it's the three lights flashing that's bad one light flashing

222
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm not sure you know it's kind of like code red code yellow the person

223
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,620
Microsoft didn't want to tell me what it really meant they just said it was a

224
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,340
hardware failure, send it back. So that's what I'm going with.

225
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:11,380
Oh crap, we put original Microsoft motherboard in there. Ugh! Stupid! No, I don't know.

226
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,800
But, yeah. I'm sorry, we can't divulge what errors, what's wrong with your system.

227
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,300
So you'll have to forgive me, if I sound a little bitter about the Xbox 360 stories tonight,

228
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,620
excuse me, but I think I have a reason to be.

229
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,420
I think you saved up your moodiness for tonight.

230
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,820
I did. Well now, and this whole printer malfunction thing just has me even more on edge with the

231
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,060
thing but you get for rearranging my stuff shut up I'm not in a good mood now

232
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:49,120
angsty hate rage fire burn comfort slash burninate Microsoft I'm so mad maybe I'll

233
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,840
be in a better mood once the damn things fix I'm going out of town tomorrow so I

234
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,680
said that's what you get for playing with the box let's move on to some

235
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,820
gaming news let's talk about something else I want I don't want to open with an

236
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,440
Xbox 360 story tonight because I'm a little pissy so I want to open with

237
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,840
something else so somebody give me a story on something else Loki please tell

238
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:20,760
me you have a story not related to Xbox 360 so anyways with the 360 no anyways

239
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,880
no we do have a story talking about the revolution and it's low low prices so

240
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,380
crazy anyways um analysts say that the revolution is supposed to be priced

241
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,380
between 200 and 250 which is pretty cool kind of what we already figured though

242
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:44,660
anyways of course revolution will be launched likely by November so looking

243
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,400
good especially since all the other systems other costs over you know $400

244
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,740
so that's not good or you know $299 for a core system that doesn't even come

245
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,300
with the frickin' chords that I need for my T.P.

246
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,260
Yeah $299, but you need a lot of stuff in order to.

247
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:08,140
I love how only with the core system do you get the ever rare composite cables minus the

248
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
S-video.

249
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,780
If you want S-video, you gotta pay another $29.99.

250
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
Not happy.

251
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,780
Go Microsoft!

252
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
Not happy.

253
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,660
I'm sorry, if I sound anti-Microsoft tonight, usually I try to be very unbiased when it

254
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,660
comes this whole thing and I you know and I would say overall our listener

255
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,220
base you know because I'm watching the chat room over orange on radio.com click

256
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,080
on chat and our listener base usually they dog on Microsoft I don't see too

257
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,340
many people dogging on Sony or Nintendo and usually I stick up for Microsoft and

258
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,820
I say you know what let's be fair to all the systems and Microsoft does that set

259
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,740
up tonight you know free rein bash Microsoft I want I don't care I'm

260
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:51,980
turning a blind eye to it. I don't care. Jamie, do you care? Let him have him. Let him bash

261
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,300
Microsoft tonight. I don't care. What? Mine works. I don't care. Mine doesn't. Therefore

262
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm angry. Does yours work too, Logie? I bring mine to work every day. Should I open my wound

263
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,120
a little more so you can pour some more salt in there? I toss my boxes inside of a bag

264
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
out there and I actually, you know, bring it and toss it in the back of my car every

265
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,760
day and, I don't know, it was one of those rare cases that it worked.

266
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm going to stick that fucking ferret in the box.

267
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
No you're not.

268
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm going to put Senor Burrito in the box.

269
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
Well I don't get how they don't know what's wrong with it and they're supposed to be spending

270
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,720
more time on quality control.

271
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I don't know if maybe Joe quality control was taking a break when your Xbox came down

272
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
the line.

273
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,360
Maybe he was taking a piss and that's why Rob's Xbox doesn't work.

274
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,320
It worked for a little bit.

275
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,000
Here's what I don't get about the Xbox problems is they'll, you know, you'll be playing this

276
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,720
system fine you shut it off okay everything's peachy you know you come back it doesn't turn

277
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,400
on what you know it's like the xbox can't break itself when you're not playing it i mean that's

278
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:59,360
really stupid just know that um you're supposed to watch water sports on the tv with your xbox 360

279
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:07,200
not actually use your xbox 360 you know in the in the whole uh let's let's water sports

280
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
Just I'm derailing your joke. Let's see some of the fury in the chat room

281
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,260
Let's see if I have any supporters in chat right now. I'm looking at chat room here

282
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:20,140
Let's see that the dark knight says Rob it had Windows 3.1 in it. Maybe I don't know. Let's see

283
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,780
What do we have? We have Rini says in communist Russia 360 breaks you

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,080

Hey! I've said plenty of smart things.

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
No, it's the smartest thing ever said on this show.

297
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
You need to listen. You need to get that Microsoft out of your ears and listen to me a little bit.

298
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Oh, I can't hit you with that.

299

It's Kingdom Hearts and it's it's the the prettiest thing I have right now. Yeah, you don't want to get it

300
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,620

Dark quality show save us save us and make this a quality show with a good story on Sony

306
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Sony and Microsoft recently Oh

307
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay, so basically we've got news about the ps3

308
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,440
Yay

309
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,240
Hooray ps3 my butt anyway. Does it work? That would be exciting news

310
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Well, we will be hearing interesting things about the current dev kits, but that's coming up in a little bit

311
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,360
They're making a new online service called the PlayStation Network

312
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,560
that's

313
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,100
Supposed to take basically what Xbox Live is doing and take it another step

314
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,800
There will be an iTunes like store that you can download films and music

315
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,800
You can use the console as a location-free player.

316
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:58,800
So you can upload stuff from your PS3 onto your PSP and watch Blu-ray and DVD movies on your handheld.

317
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Also, the PS3 will act as a digital video recorder.

318
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,800
You can save your television programs like you would with TiVo.

319
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,800
You also would be able to control the DVR function using your PSP.

320
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,080
As announced earlier you will it'll play blu-ray, but that's not gonna really affect the price all that much. It's supposed to

321
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,360
They said that the cell and RSX we're gonna be able to take care of most of it

322
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,240
So instead of paying the big prices you would for just a blu-ray machine

323
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,960
Instead you're just gonna pay pretty much top console price

324
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,680
Where you're looking at, of course that we haven't gotten an official word on what exactly that price is going to be

325
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,820
The other couple of things is that the dev kit was running faster than they predicted

326
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:56,320
and that there are a bunch of games in development that they're putting out publicly for now.

327
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,720
Also the PS3 should be getting regular firmware functionality updates like the PSP does.

328
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,700
You know, one thing nice I'll say about Microsoft for the 24 hours or so that my system worked,

329
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,000
I actually really liked how you could go online and download trailers because I have a high

330
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,920
high-def TV, so I downloaded the X-Men 3 trailer and the Mission Impossible 3 trailer and watched

331
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,360
on the TV, and I thought it was beautiful.

332
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,760
And there's no pixelation or anything, I thought it was great.

333
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,040
So hearing that Sony is developing something similar, especially when you consider that

334
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,120
Sony also has a major movie outlet and stuff with their iTunes-style store, that sounds

335
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
pretty exciting to me.

336
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,040
There's also another thing that was stated, which a few people I'm sure should find exciting.

337
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,680
Today, US developers have been told to prepare for a fall release.

338
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,760
So it should be sometime this year, which means that everywhere else in the world will

339
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,000
have to wait until, what, summer 2007, while Japan has been playing it for, you know, most

340
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
of the year.

341
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Loki, do you have anything to add to this story about PlayStation 3?

342
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,960
Yeah, we'll be lucky to see it this year.

343
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Really?

344
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
What makes you say that?

345
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,480
They don't have any of the dev kits out yet.

346
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,320
They're especially not the alpha kits or the beta kits, so it's gonna be a while before we see this thing

347
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,680
I'm gonna be guaranteeing that you're not gonna see anything playable at E3

348
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,900
So really you think so I think so and the only thing that I can say about it right now is

349
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,600
If you really want to you'd be still taking they're taking pre-orders on the ps3 games right now retailing around

350
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
$59.99 like all the other 360 games

351
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,020
games. People need to realize that just because it's a new console system does not mean that

352
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:42,020
they need to pay $60 per game for stuff. Just wait a couple weeks and it'll go used.

353
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,920
Any other comments on Playstation 3? You guys excited or you know, just...

354
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,440
I'm trying not to be excited. I'm containing my excitement.

355
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,360
I wish it would come out this year. I mean, the longer they wait, it's kind of... But

356
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,000
you know what? Here's what I've learned. If they'll release a system that works, it's

357
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,300
worth the wait. Here's the race, which will come out first. PlayStation 3 or Advent Children?

358
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,360
I don't know, I don't know. Alright, let's go to a completely different topic. Oh, look!

359
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,040
Look, I got a Microsoft story! I'm so excited! Actually, not really, because it's cross-platform,

360
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,040
so I'll be... I'm specifically addressing the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of Final

361
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:27,880
Fantasy XI tonight. And Final Fantasy XI recently had this big crackdown on guild sellers.

362
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,140
The other day, folks logged in and noticed if you did a scan of some of the very popular

363
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:39,400
regions where folks usually are doing their gill farming, such as Kuftal Tunnel, because

364
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:46,680
that's an area where you can camp Amamet, but there's this monster you can camp there

365
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,160
and the item that drops, you sell for millions.

366
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,460
That's how gill farmers essentially make their money is that they camp these things exclusively

367
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,380
and then drive up the prices of the items that they drop at the auction house, so that's

368
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,040
how they get all their gil.

369
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,800
And this has been a rampant problem in Final Fantasy XI, practically a couple months after

370
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,520
I started playing this was already an epidemic, so I'm kind of looking at this going, gee

371
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,840
I left the game a few months ago and now they're finally cracking down on this stuff?

372
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,960
You know, things that could have been done yesterday, I don't know if it's because of

373
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,800
the impending Microsoft roll out that they thought, oh maybe now's a good time to kind

374
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,120
of pay attention to what's going on here, or maybe with the expansion, or I don't know

375
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
what.

376
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,480
hear about it at their upcoming expo, but they finally banned all these guild sellers

377
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,440
and good riddance, they were screwing up the economy, it's about time, too little too late

378
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,480
in my opinion though, not enough to get me back to the game, sorry.

379
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,880
Still glad I quit.

380
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,580
In other Final Fantasy XI news though, and relating to the expo 360 version, the beta

381
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:51,840
will be ending in April-ish, right around the time that the new expansion is about to

382
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,200
So it's set to launch April 18th in North America April 20th in Japan and they're saying the beta will end

383
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,040
Probably about a week before that rolls out. I did hear before my birthday

384
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,600
I did hear rumor though that they would the beta players would be able to transfer their characters over

385
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,480
Well goodie for them. We're gonna be cool, but I'm not gonna buy it

386
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,360
I would have loved to participate in the beta, but I can't right now

387
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,960
You know want to know why want to know why I know why?

388
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,360
the other thing is the beta signups are over so

389
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,360
There's double reasons. You're double screwed.

390
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,860
Hooray. It doesn't matter, you didn't miss out on anything, you just

391
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,360
loaded up and you're like, wow, it's exactly like the other one on the PC and on the PlayStation 2.

392
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,360
I wanted to see it on my pretty high-screen, or high-screen, high-death

393
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
widescreen

394
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,360
TV. If you want. I mentioned I'm having a little bit of an off night tonight.

395
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,660
I can hook mine up, you know. I don't care anymore. No, I don't care anymore.

396
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,860
Alright.

397
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,620
Moving on, let's go to another story.

398
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,780
Let's talk about another MMO, and actually a follow-up to something we were talking about

399
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
last week.

400
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,340
What's going on in the World of Warcraft, Loki?

401
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,380
Well, a couple things.

402
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:07,340
First off, gay rights groups are calling Blizzard, saying you need to change your World of Warcraft

403
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:15,300
policies to basically be more clear on the different types of things.

404
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,620
you know the whole thing is they're saying that you know promoting a you

405
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:25,460
know gay or lesbian friendly guild as harassment is just retarded and you know

406
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,220
understand that the rules are in place you know for certain things but they're

407
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,420
kind of there the rules are too broad and so that you know they're using this

408
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:42,940
to basically use it as it's not intended so you know as I said last week if they

409
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,860
just had no warn this player under harassment I don't think it would have

410
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,220
been taken so offensively and I don't think this whole thing would have

411
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,880
mushroom clouded on him essentially is what happened but you know now that all

412
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,140
this has been brought to light you know we kind of already talked about it last

413
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,820
week you know I agree I think Blizzard needs to come out and say where they

414
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,400
stand on these things or I guess they kind of have come out and say where they

415
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,420
stand but they really need to clarify this because they are looking a little

416
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,300
hypocritical with the, you know, slash silly that we talked about last week and all that.

417
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Basically the comment was Stonewall, a group founded in 1989, a professional lobbying group

418
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:26,780
campaigning for the rights of lesbians and gay men and bisexuals, their spokesperson

419
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,360
Jonathan Finney said, this attempt to create a safe and gay friendly environment should

420
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,380
be welcomed, not blocked.

421
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,900
And hopefully this is just a misunderstanding and would encourage Blizzard to review their

422
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,540
policies and make sure that it has an effect, or has an effect where it needs to be, so.

423
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,900
It's been over a week now, I don't know if Blizzard's ever really going to do anything

424
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,860
else on this, I think they're just going to kind of let this keep going.

425
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,520
I would have thought if Blizzard was going to say something we would have really heard

426
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,620
it by now, besides, you know, we did get a clarification on a message board, but it wasn't

427
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,620
good enough.

428
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,620
So, eh.

429
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Extover, have a comment?

430
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
Extover have a comment. I

431
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,100
Was just gonna ask you Rob didn't you didn't you report people in the general chat?

432
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,020
No, I didn't and I I I was gonna do it and then I couldn't I couldn't really figure out it was too complicated

433
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:22,060
I know I shouldn't I should think I own well that I did I mean the thing is aside from that those that

434
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:29,580
These people are saying like all kinds of things like in the general chat or whatever that are just really inappropriate

435
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:39,800
appropriate. It's just blasphemous. It doesn't have any place in the game or whatever, and

436
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:46,180
yet you see these same people in general chat every day in World of Warcraft, and obviously

437
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,220
they're not getting banned or anything. They're not getting warnings. It's kind of hypocritical,

438
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
I think.

439
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,860
You know something I did find interesting, though, is I actually switched servers and

440
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,980
I tried playing on a roleplay server for a little bit this week because I hadn't really

441
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,380
been on a roleplay server yet, and so far I noticed the roleplay folks happen to be

442
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,380
more mature.

443
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
At least in my experience.

444
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,820
It might just be the particular servers I've been picking, but in general, the roleplay

445
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,100
server has been more mature overall, and you don't get that bullshit Chuck Norris talk

446
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,660
in the middle of town and stuff that isn't happening.

447
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,980
I don't know if it's because the server's new as well.

448
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,360
I tried out a new RP server, but I don't know.

449
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,280
But to be honest, the longer Blizzard goes without addressing this, I don't know how

450
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,460
much longer I really want to keep playing this game.

451
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,860
in mind that the in the district RP servers you are not allowed to be out of

452
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,780
character at all you can get get kicked basically if you if they catch you being

453
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,940
blatantly out of character without any sort of specific comment toward being

454
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,180
out of character and you know I I actually roleplay a mute character

455
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,100
because I don't ever talk to people that's that's my I roleplay a mute mute

456
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:56,560
character and I'm doing a very good job actually I play I play an undead and all

457
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,520
All I say is brains.

458
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Brains!

459
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Dork.

460
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:07,080
Alright, is there another follow-up regarding the whole concepts of sexuality in this MMO,

461
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
Loki?

462
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
There is.

463
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:17,000
In Blizzard, there is basically a chat log posted about between a player and a GM confirming

464
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,100
that two female characters could get reported for trying to marry each other.

465
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:30,020
pretty much blows the whole it doesn't belong in the game argument up there. Anyways, a

466
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,500
couple of the things they were talking about, the one player here was trying to point out

467
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:41,820
where is this actually in the documents here. And the whole issue of the thing is that other

468
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:49,140
players might not be mature enough and might take offense to this or start harassing other

469
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,680
players you know saying like this night elf is camping my ass or something like

470
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,540
that and so you know their excuse is basically well there's some players in

471
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,800
World of Warcraft that aren't mature enough for this game and so they might

472
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,360
you know start harassing people so therefore we can't you know give them

473
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,640
some it's basically no they're saying they're flame bait is yeah so clarify

474
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,840
this for you because this is something I didn't even realize last week when I

475
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,080
went off I didn't even realize this and I don't know how much longer I wanna

476
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,120
talk about this this week but but this is new news to me this is something

477
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,280
for the argument, you're saying that male and female characters can get married in the

478
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
game.

479
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Apparently, I guess.

480
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,960
But I thought sexuality had no place in World of Warcraft.

481
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,080
Well, apparently it doesn't unless it's heterosexual.

482
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,720
Oh, I see.

483
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,960
So yet another hypocrisy on Blizzard's part.

484
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Oh, okay.

485
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,760
Just wanted to clarify that, thank you.

486
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,440
Not to mention, though, that Blizzard isn't the only MMO out there that doesn't allow

487
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,280
gay marriage, Final Fantasy XI, and other ones as well.

488
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,360
But every Mithra on Final Fantasy XI is a gay man playing it anyway.

489
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Just teasing.

490
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Don't send the hate mail.

491
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Just teasing.

492
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
I played one.

493
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I know.

494
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I know.

495
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
I'm teasing.

496
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
Aren't you a gay man?

497
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Shut up!

498
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:08,520
Seriously though, I can let that slide in that case because A, Final Fantasy XI doesn't

499
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,720
give a crap about the GLBT guilds and all that stuff.

500
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,000
They let that stuff go on and that's fine.

501
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,740
they can kind of pass it off as, you know,

502
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,740
well, it doesn't really fit the time period of the game.

503
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,520
And I'm okay with that because they don't make an issue

504
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,880
of the guilds and the other stuff.

505
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,440
But now I have a problem with World of Warcraft

506
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,080
because they've made an issue of all this other stuff

507
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,880
saying sexuality has no place in the game yet.

508
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,360
They do allow the, you know, only the opposite sex marriage.

509
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,520
And like in Final Fantasy XI,

510
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,720
you don't know who's really a boy and who's really a girl,

511
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,960
so there's probably same gender weddings happening

512
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,400
the time but you know it's all role-play anyway so oh I've gone cross-eyed of

513
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,240
course you can't marry if you're a gay person in World of Warcraft but you can

514
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:56,840
register as a domestic partner and then that means did you get insurance and

515
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:02,480
yeah same yeah the same benefit you just can't call it marriage I look people I'm

516
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,420
going to chat room now let's see uh Ami Damaru flame says I sent a message to an

517
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,380
admin and I was told that's what ignore is for oh that's that's a lovely

518
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,540
response thanks thanks Blizzard another yet another inconsistency on Blizzard's

519
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,800
part let's see what was the other one here is another going Oh Rob way said

520
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,920
the rule should be no explicit sex talk within Wow gay straight or beyond I'd be

521
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,440
okay with that if it was consistent it's not so I know there's there just needs

522
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:43,340
to be consistency all right moving on new topic let's go over to Jamie

523
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:49,260
completely opposite different topic about as far away from this whole wow

524
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,680
debate as we can get what's going on I'm sure the entire world really gives a

525
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,720
crap about this but EA signed Tiger Woods for six more years oh so we can we

526
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,620
will continue to have the Tiger Woods golf games and which I don't really get

527
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,820
because you know it would be something if they would actually sort of make

528
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,260
changes in between the games but you know and this will probably make you

529
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,380
happy the Xbox 360 version was supposed to be like crap they didn't it has the

530
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,940
least amount of features to it but they have switched to like a whole analog

531
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:21,460
scheme for how they're having it play but still do we need more Tiger Woods

532
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:27,160
games can't he like retire like Madden did whatever you know as long as the

533
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,500
guy's popular games with his name attached to it are gonna sell he is

534
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,740
cute he's you know he sees he's a very respectable sports figure I'm not a big

535
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,940
sports fan I don't really follow any sports for everything from golf to

536
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,900
football notice how we're doing a show the day of the Super Bowl obviously I'm

537
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,180
not following football um but you know Tiger Woods strikes me it's one of the

538
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,100
more respectable type of yeah I would hit that he doesn't know he doesn't have

539
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,460
to worry about what the games are gonna net him because his golfing is still

540
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:04,460
gonna send money rolling in. Personally, I'd rather play, what was it, Happy Gilmore's

541
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:12,700
PGA Tour 2006. That'd be a better game. Moving on. I have another Nintendo Revolution story

542
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,700
and it's more of a teaser than anything else, a little bit of a rumor. That has to do with

543
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,740
Game Developers Conference because you know the Game Developers Conference is right around

544
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,380
the corner and Nintendo you know even though they say you know e3 is the time

545
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,380
when they're gonna really show the goods on what the revolution is about there

546
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,980
might be some teasers at the game developers conference because

547
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,860
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata will take time to talk about a couple new

548
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,700
revolution details now doubtful he's gonna actually show any games in

549
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,700
progress probably just gonna be little appetizers just little flavorings he'll

550
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,980
kind of kind of let you smell what's cooking in the kitchen but won't really

551
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,360
let you see what's going on there but nevertheless all the Nintendo fanboys in

552
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,580
the world are going like can't wait just salivating for more information on the

553
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,500
revolution so game developers conference is the the time when there will be some

554
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,840
more hints March 20th is the day of the game developers conference and of course

555
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,700
when the news is unwrapped we will bring it to you here on the show and might

556
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:21,260
possibly be salivating ourselves. We'll see.

557
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,360
Moving on, Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360 besides them breaking?

558
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:32,620
Well, actually, they're working on fixing certain problems with systems glitching out.

559
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:39,040
They've actually had a firmware update or dashboard update to fix some of the guide

560
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,640
problems that they've been having, also increased the accuracy of the last time played thing

561
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,040
on there, which is kind of cool, I guess.

562
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,760
And then another great feature, disabling the kiosk disk from working anymore, so trying

563
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
to stomp out more homebrew.

564
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,640
We talked about that a couple of weeks on the show, how the kiosk disk, somebody figured

565
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,040
out how to copy it and play it on the Xbox 360 and they would say, oh, it's going to

566
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,440
be this new way to expose homebrew, well Microsoft just brought down the fist of justice on that,

567
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
didn't they?

568
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,840
Well, yes and no.

569
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:18,640
Yes, they have, but no they haven't because the actual files are on the hard drive, the

570
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,400
update, and you could in a sense go back and either edit the update or delete the update

571
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
and bring that all back.

572
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:34,320
It's not like a Sony firmware where you flash an actual chip and then you're screwed, you're

573
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,880
stuck with it.

574
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,840
Okay, interesting.

575
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,280
Alright, what's going on for the rest of the year?

576
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
What other things is Xbox 360 going to do this year besides, you know, break more

577
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,440
systems?

578
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,840
Well, they actually have a lot of games coming out. Do I sound bitter? I'm sorry, do I sound bitter?

579
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,320
Yeah, just a little bit. Just a little bit. Lots of games have been announced.

580
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,520
There was actually a huge list here posted on joystick.com. They had pretty

581
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,440
much the whole lineup, or at least what's been announced this year

582
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,480
for the rest of the year. And some really cool stuff.

583
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,960
One I'm looking forward to that's actually coming up here pretty soon

584
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,040
Far Cry Instincts Predator is going to be pretty neat

585
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,160
Though it kind of looks like a rehash of the

586
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,480
first one and then of course

587
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,720
some stuff we're going to be talking about later Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 2

588
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,720
which would be kind of good and some other cool stuff Unreal Tournament 2007

589
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,780
probably coinciding with the PS3

590
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,040
launch game. A Newcastle Wolfenstein game

591
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,320
which is awesome and I'm hoping hopefully we'll get Quake Wars because

592
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,800
that one looks really sweet

593
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,120
Alone in the Dark, you know more inspiration for Rui Bull

594
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,320
and SSX4 pretty much just a you know

595
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,720
a whole slew of games, a lot of tie-ins with movies should be

596
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,480
a really good year though and that would be you know what forget it I'm just gonna

597
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,360
sound more bitter

598
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,720
stop being bitter I can't I can't help it that was a lot of money I spent

599
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,920
spent I actually I did have a a comment regarding you people I

600
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,040
I didn't know if we were it had been addressed about the

601
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,720
Metal Gear yeah we're we're a little bit it's coming up later

602
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,040
alright I'm let's go ahead and I go on to

603
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,240
the revolution we just we're just ping-pong in between all the next-gen

604
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,720
systems tonight that's alright though

605
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,800
are confusing me I know I'm sorry try not to go cross-eyed on cross-eyed earlier

606
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I did that the other day.

607
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,800
See, you're bitter about that. So you've got that to be bitter about.

608
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I'm not, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not bitter about it.

609
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,800
It's just I couldn't see for 30 minutes.

610
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Okay, that was scary.

611
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,800
You couldn't see my Xbox 360 not working. That's right.

612
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Someone had to email me about that at work.

613
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Alright, move on. GameDaily.com posted this list called

614
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,400
called 10 obscure Super Nintendo games that we want to play on the revolution

615
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,440
and I don't really know how newsworthy this this is but it may dig and I

616
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,920
thought it's it's it's a good thing to discuss on the show a nice little topic

617
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,200
to kind of bounce around I don't know why people always want to make lists but

618
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,280
here it is another list we're gonna be doing a list actually later tonight so

619
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,240
maybe I shouldn't be bashing it too much here's their list of games they want to

620
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,280
see playable on the revolution in the little like emulation thing is of

621
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,600
course you know the revolution you're supposed to be able to play old games on

622
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,160
it Mario Paint Actraiser I thought Actraiser was a weird game to put on

623
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,200
here because I thought isn't revolution always supposed to do the first-party

624
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,540
games or do we know about I guess we really don't know if third-party I guess

625
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,080
it would be whichever one sign on right so we'll see I guess the possibility

626
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:46,600
earthbound good choice UN squadron moving on down the list Legend of the

627
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,720
Mystical Ninja also known as going on desert strike jungle strike urban strike

628
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,240
No, even though that's three separate games. They're looping that into one now. See I don't know cuz that's more

629
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,320
That's more of a Genesis thing. I attached those games to Genesis for me, but I don't know

630
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Evo search for Eden

631
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,920
Uniracers

632
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,880
That was one of those like really it kind of I like Gina racers

633
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,100
It was strange but kind of fun Robo cop versus Terminator

634
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,880
Okay, that was retarded and then out of this world and flashback the quest for identity

635
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,920
I did not like out of this world at all. I was like hello 3do game

636
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,560
I don't know why that's on that list, but whatever and I also thought it was weird that they said obscure Super Nintendo games

637
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,900
I'm like earthbound wasn't that obscure

638
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,540
I mean sure they never really you know

639
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,060
They sat on a actually doing a sequel for a long long time and now it may not even come out here

640
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,320
But I don't know if it was obscure, but okay, whatever whatever. I'll look past that

641
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,400
Anything that's missing from this list you think Super Nintendo games that we ought to be able to play on the revolution

642
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Besides the big ones, we all know Metroid, Zelda, besides the big ones, slightly obscure games at least.

643
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Anything that you think is missing. I'll say one. Here's an obscure game I used to love.

644
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,400
I know for a fact this won't be playable in Revolution, though, because it was a Sony game.

645
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Equinox, the sequel to Solstice. I loved that game. I'd love to see that, but that's obviously me living in a fantasy world.

646
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
Anybody else want to add anything?

647
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
What was the Equinox?

648
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Did you ever play Solstice?

649
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,400
I'm having trouble remembering because I remember that.

650
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,400
It was a bit of a puzzle game. It was like 3D, isometric type thing.

651
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
And you kind of walked around.

652
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
It had square movement.

653
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
It was very tactics-y.

654
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
It had that edge to it.

655
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,400
A little bit. It was more action-oriented, but I can see it had the tactics look to it.

656
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Certainly did.

657
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:44,760
I know this one's not obscure, but I would give my, like, left knee cap for, um, Star

658
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,760
Fox.

659
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Okay.

660
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,760
Yeah.

661
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,760
That's a good one.

662
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
That's a good one.

663
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,000
Definitely a first-party title a lot of folks want to see.

664
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Loki?

665
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Nothing?

666
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,240
Um, you know, I didn't play that many Super Nintendo games, and it's really sad.

667
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,160
I liked Super, um, Mario RPG.

668
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,240
I think that'd be one that they would probably do.

669
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,600
Let's see...

670
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,960
Other than that, you know, it really wasn't too much.

671
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,060
I was a huge fan of Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is like kind of like

672
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,320
a cheap version of Sonic the Hedgehog.

673
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,000
That was one of the first games I had, which is weird.

674
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,800
Freaking Dracula X. But the Super Nintendo port was

675
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,240
assy compared to the original. I think that they could have...

676
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,040
It would have been prohibitively expensive because you have this whole

677
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,980
other scenario with maria that they just didn't do maybe they could say okay now

678
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,680
that we have revolution technology here's dracula x the way it should have

679
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,280
been

680
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,960
and of course at all of us who have these three hundred dollar copies of

681
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,160
of uh... dracula x for pc engine are gonna find their copy north fifty bucks

682
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,120
uh... let's see what the chat room has to say over at orange lounge radio dot com

683
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,020
click on chat wonder dog harold says

684
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,480
zombies ate my neighbors

685
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,760
oh my god yes

686
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,800
i'd like to see a new version of their put on xbox lives arcade upgrade or

687
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,640
Smash TV. Super Smash TV. Fire Bulma said Smash TV. There you go. Reenie says Yoshi's

688
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:16,080
Island. Yes. There you go. Yoshi's Cookie. PK Akira 88, Yoshi Safari, where the Super

689
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,120
Scope won. Wasn't that the Super Scope one where you run around? It's all about the mole

690
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,300
game. Where you shot moles with the Super Scope. I don't remember that. It was just

691
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,080
the generic cartridge that came with it, but either it was like the games, like it was

692
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:35,400
I don't know. I was pretty ghetto. I had the Sega Menacer dude. Cool. The Menacer was cool because you could take it apart

693
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,080
Yeah, it sucked. I have I still have a minister really. All right

694
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,520
Toe jam and roll. Let's keep it moving. Let's go over that super Turrican. I love that game

695
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,460
So you're cheating you're looking I can't remember the name of it. Okay. Yes

696
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:57,620
I am brought up a big list to see we're Nintendo games. All right, I'm just messing with you. All right, let's

697
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,300
Let's go over and open up the mailbag cuz you know dark Sakura

698
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,800
She likes to open up your email and you guys send your emails to mailbag at orange laundry calm and she reads them

699
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,980
And then I have a good laugh. Yeah, she laughs at the you know, hate mail

700
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,380
She laughs at the hate mail and then read some of the good ones on air

701
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,080
I don't get before we start before we start get love mail before we start mail

702
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,080
But I see now they're gonna send you hate mail who said you don't know

703
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,440
Before we start mailbag tonight if I may on a personal note

704
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:33,000
Because I got some emails directly to my personal email address this week and you know last week on the show

705
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,540
I had a coming out of sorts because I never mentioned

706
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,900
You know the fact that I was gay until we talked about the World of Warcraft thing

707
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,340
Although folks have been listening to live show knew it for a long time. I actually thought it was in my bio

708
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,300
I didn't realize that folks have been listening to the podcast for so long didn't know it

709
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,180
So it kind of was a coming out of sorts and I just want to say I got some

710
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:59,300
Really amazing emails of support from people, you know from all across like it didn't matter if they were straight gay

711
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,680
You know, whatever. I just got some amazing emails that really just

712
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,620
Made me remember why I do this show for free

713
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,940
To simply put it and a lot of them were so long and personal

714
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,800
I'm not gonna read them on the air

715
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,260
But I just want to say thanks and you guys are awesome and we really do have the best listeners

716
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,780
We really don't we're not just saying that we really really do and I would just like to take a moment right here on my

717
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,180
Debut on Orange Lawns radios podcast. Yes that that I'm gonna come out

718
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:30,900
And so if you guys want to email me a bunch of amazing emails like to me to my email

00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,540
possibly comment on them yeah except there's a difference see i came out as gay you're coming

722
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:49,580
out as an asshole that's a bleached one i'm just messing with a bad bad joke yeah that old joke

723
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,380
i like men too where was the mail oh yes there's the mailbag let's let's move on to the mailbag

724
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:02,780
shall we um hi okay uh i actually i went over my limit because i got a bunch of emails this week

725
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:08,220
again. So, um, the first one I'm going to bring up is sent by Malice. I'm just going

726
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:12,420
to read this as a question actually put forth to us. I was wondering if you

727
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,560
people knew about this. I wish to know more about it before I purchase it.

728
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:21,300
Skipping forward, it seems to be a special edition of Grand Theft Auto San

729
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,340
Andreas with a 30-minute prologue CG or animation. It's apparently a budget title

730
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,500
as it is $20. I want to know what you guys think about it before I show out

731
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:36,500
the cash. I don't really think anything of Grand Theft Auto.

732
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,540
I defer to Loki because I don't really play these games either.

733
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:45,720
It's just the platinum hit or greatest hits or whatever version of Grand Theft Auto San

734
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,720
Andreas because they've sold millions and millions of copies, so it came out at a new

735
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,240
low low price of $19.95. And that's all it really is.

736
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,380
And of course every now and then the new trend now, especially with Devil May Cry 3 Special

737
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,700
edition save release you know a little added features as well on top of you

738
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,620
know dropping the price of the game so a little extra something for me I'm gonna

739
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,340
be honest even though I understand why the game gets a lot of critical praise

740
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,900
and all that stuff it's kind of one of those games that's fun for me for a

741
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,540
couple days and then I'm kind of tired of it you know it is a game that you can

742
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,700
literally play up play the mission you know pick up play the missions or just

743
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,420
fuck around and it's really cool it's really fun

744
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:30,140
Sandra is definitely the best one in the series so far so I mean 20 bucks for that game

745
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,460
You can play for hours and hours and I'll get bored of it

746
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:38,460
So I say I highly recommend the storylines really good in it too. So let's check out a main character named jizzy

747
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:46,420
No, it's CJ. Oh, I thought it was jizzy. No, it's I'm calling him jizzy. That's only in the hot coffee mod

748
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,980
Alright next email

749
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,420
Okay, this one comes from me. So sky

750
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:58,900
Um, it's titled Fantasy Star Universe vs. Final Fantasy XI, as in EKS, EYE, I thought

751
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,900
that was cute.

752
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,340
Um, hello, I love the new format that you guys are giving the show and I kinda want

753
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,940
you to debate on something if you can.

754
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,600
A couple months ago I got Final Fantasy XI for my PC, my father would allow me to play

755
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,100
as long as I got good grades, so there's my copy of Final Fantasy XI sitting in the corner

756
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,940
crying and gathering dust.

757
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,620
I also recently found out about the new Corsair job and I think it looks pretty.

758
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,580
I would buy and play the game just because of the sexy outfits before the course airdrop.

759
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:28,340
Now I have recently gotten back with my PSO community and they are getting ready for Phantasy

760
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,500
Star Universe.

761
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,860
This game too is also very sexy mainly because of all the new weapons and new character creator.

762
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,500
I would like to stick with one MMO but they seem so good.

763
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:44,680
I have $70 to waste and importing PSU from my station of playing too is looking very

764
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
good right now.

765
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,140
So what do you think?

766
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,980
It's tough because I haven't really played Phantasy Star Universe.

767
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,540
I played a little bit at the E3 demo kiosk, but I can only really go off my experience

768
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,620
with Phantasy Star Online and how it might be a little bit different.

769
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,780
Here's the thing.

770
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,580
Here's the biggest difference between the two games.

771
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,580
It's basically fundamentally how the attack systems work, is that in Phantasy Star you

772
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:11,780
hit a button to literally swing your sword, so it's more of an action-based MMO.

773
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,620
Whereas in Final Fantasy XI, you're auto-swinging your sword, and you're doing other things

774
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,900
with that such as you know your weapon skills or your magic or whatever it's

775
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,980
more of a quote-unquote traditional style RPG in MMO form it's a little hard

776
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,020
to explain it's not like other Final Fantasies at all because the battle

777
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,300
system is so much different although if you played the 12 demo it's kind of

778
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,700
similar the 12 demo um I think the question is how much action do you want

779
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,940
in your MMO do you want something that's more action based go with fantasy star

780
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,660
you want something that's more strategy based go with Final Fantasy 11 but

781
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,660
That's not to say Phantasy Star doesn't involve some strategy, and Final Fantasy 11 doesn't

782
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,260
involve some action, it's just that Phantasy Star is a little more action-heavy, and I

783
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,420
think if you want to decide between those two, that's where it's going to be.

784
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,860
Also here's the other thing to consider, Final Fantasy 11 is going to be cheaper because

785
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,420
the game's been out for a long time to get started on that on PC, it's only like 20 bucks

786
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,780
right now, whereas Phantasy Star Universe is going to be a little more expensive.

787
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:11,300
So there's the pros and cons, I can't really say which is better, because they're different.

788
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,260
They're different, and I haven't played enough of Universe to really judge it, but even if

789
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:19,200
If I'm putting Final Fantasy XI and Phantasy Star side by side, they're just too different.

790
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,100
I can't compare them.

791
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,080
I'd say go play World of Warcraft.

792
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,080
Stop.

793
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:30,440
No, seriously, if you want a cool actual good game, I mean play World of Warcraft.

794
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,400
Stay away from Final Fantasy XI because it'll just make you sad.

795
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,160
Well, at least don't be a white mage.

796
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,160
Was your experience...

797
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,920
Because you become the bitch of the party.

798
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,040
Yeah, but same thing with a priest and wow.

799
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,920
But did you have a bad experience with Final Fantasy XI Extover?

800
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,960
Well it just seemed like every single time, well I mean, let me just give the game just

801
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,560
a little bit of credit because I did actually enjoy playing it a lot but the thing is it

802
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:03,160
just got really tiring on having to try and find a party all the freaking time and also

803
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,080
when I was in a party it was just like drama.

804
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,440
It was just so much drama.

805
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,840
I'd rather deal with drama in a guild on World of Warcraft where I can just leave it and

806
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:18,720
say you know screw you guys I'm going home you know whatever but like on Final

807
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,600
Fantasy 11 I mean you're like black booked if you if you're like really bad

808
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,040
in a party without be intending to be people really remember that and they

809
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,440
don't want you in your party anymore hmm all right next people it kept wanting me

810
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,260
in their stupid party but I hated them I let the tank die on purpose because okay

811
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,140
I told you about the party I was in with the tank who was a jerk. I let him die.

812
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,180
There's jerks in every game though. The rest of the party thanked me. There's jerks in every game.

813
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,460
Next up comes from

814
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:55,480
Okay for a moment. I could not hear myself on the microphone. This one comes from Steve

815
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:02,420
Hi, Steve. I think I'm gonna start doing that with all the people that email us. I'm gonna say hi to him. So hi Steve!

816
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,260
Steve is

817
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,940
Actually, I'm going to say right now a very kind soul

818
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:13,860
for other reasons we might discuss later okay um but he was actually sending me

819
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,540
questions looking for information on Judy Crystal about other songs that she

820
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:25,580
did okay and I had sort of been into Judy Crystal for a little bit but not

821
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:32,000
like you know majorly majorly um but she basically Judy Crystal did God of

822
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,860
Romance in new DER here's a little clip of God of Romance just in case you're

823
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:53,220
not unfamiliar with Judy Crystal, which is actually a remake of Romantu no Kami-sama,

824
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,420
which I've played in pre-shows before.

825
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:03,460
Maybe I'll put it in next week's pre-show, but at any rate, she did Tokyo already, Baby

826
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:13,460
love me you can't hurry love and nori nori nori oh yeah but it mostly for

827

hope that answers it all right very cool um now we also have received an email

835
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:09,460
from BigBadRemi, who I had a very interesting email from at first.

836
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,220
I had actually intended on going back and making a public apology to the one who I said

837
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,380
I didn't think is being very professional over the whole Mac thing, being a graphic

838
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:23,860
artist, given that Mac is the standard for graphic artists, but there are people who

839
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:33,100
are very prone toward PC maybe had a bad experience with a Mac I'm not going to

840
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,660
even look at Loki right now just call it truce let's let's keep but for the sake

841
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:44,500
of for the sake of the show I am no longer joining the debate I am going to

842
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,620
buy my I'm actually getting a Mac for my birthday because I intend on being more

843
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:54,460
serious with my art and I'd see that as a natural progression for myself as an

844
00:58:54,460 --> 00:59:00,420
artist good for you and I say that coffin not only needs to have the last

845
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,980
nail shoved into it whatever you're thinking Loki swallow it and it needs to

846
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:09,900
be set on fire I like your xbox laugh Loki's laughing at remember their

847
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,820
swallow remember I'm just saying I don't bring it up every week everyone else

848
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,340
brings it up they try to drag me back into this I don't really care you know

849
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:25,000
it sorry if it seemed offensive I don't aim to offend but that was how I felt

850
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,900
that it just sort of blindsided me because every professional graphic

851
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,960
artist I know and I know a lot of them I live in California every last one of

852
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,140
them uses a Mac so I was just really sort of blindsided by that one but that

853
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:46,520
was where I came from um in in defense a little bit tiny bit I don't want to go

854
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,380
too far that but I did used to work for a publishing company and we used both

855
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:54,220
we use both so there's some things you see does better something that might

856
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:58,700
does better just depends on how you use it I use both and I I don't have a

857
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:04,100
preference actually I like both I'm actually digging the tiger oh the Mac OS

858
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,980
tiger yeah so yeah you're by computer roll I am I you're totally fine freaking

859
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:14,140
by all right I'm try computer all right because I have some Linux love now all

860
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:21,780
alright whoo anyway anyway anyway anyway simultaneous loving baby this is kind of

861
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:29,780
I'm going to paraphrase because some of it seems a little bit more personal than

862
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:36,100
I comfortable going into um but uh one of our listeners James sent in an email

863
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:44,060
hi James you know what Rob I'm gonna show this to you okay you're going

864
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:49,460
from mr. stress I hate the Xbox to hi I'm trying to turn that angst into

865
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:54,900
something more useful as world anyway it's not useful go back to it angst is

866
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:03,500
hot except for when it's on read your email that is so hot basically it was

867
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:12,220
you know saying that things were fairly rough and then DDR was out the DDR

868
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:22,620
extreme and had absolutely addicted to it but was talking about how it was sort of alienating

869
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,660
to because when you know you know a lot of us went through that being when we played

870
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:31,300
DDR there was just an oh you played that game you know oh like the taunting of the other

871
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:38,780
people at the arcades you know and like oh the you know the fags playing DDR that he

872
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,840
was playing in a small crowd gathered around we all we know how the crowd goes

873
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,060
and then he met his best friend that way and has met many more friends through

874
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:48,940
the game and I was thinking a lot of us were like that you know Loki Dark

875
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:53,740
Sakura and I all met through DDR yeah I met my very best friend in the universe

876
01:01:53,740 --> 01:02:00,940
through DDR you know it's opened all kinds of doors you know not just for me

877
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:06,780
personally for all of us it's open door we we started off as a DDR show that was

878
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:13,060
our thing we went to we were we even came up with the concept in the name on

879
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:20,940
the Bart going to San Francisco to play DDR the metreon if that's not nerdy

880
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:28,980
enough so I'm sorry for sort of picking a paraphrasing it I I didn't want to

881
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,300
give a written response to it until I had actually had a chance to read it on

882
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:38,540
the air but I have to say that good for you it's very good for you and you know

883
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:45,020
I love seeing how many people have had their lives better through DDR I know

884
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:50,700
people who have pulled themselves out of some serious health issues through

885
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,660
playing DDR just don't get caught up in drama drama revolution oh yeah like DDR

886
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:05,500
versus itg just ignore it and then no get past it yeah okay um i also got an email from uh danny

887
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:12,860
hi danny uh she um writes in and says thank you for the rick sanchos interview i'm seriously

888
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:16,860
considering a game tap subscription because i think it is the ideal service for a casual gamer

889
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,900
like me i'd rather much pay for four months worth of game tap service and try a variety of games and

890
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,940
and pay $60 for one game.

891
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,500
I have four kids who run through games like water and I can't buy them a new game every

892
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,500
week.

893
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,540
Also, the idea of a service that does the hard work for me is appealing.

894
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,140
Folding with an emulator is not my idea of gaming, neither is visiting sites for ROMs

895
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,900
and having to wade through all the ads with naked anime characters to get to a kid's game."

896
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,900
Agreed.

897
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,780
Did GameTamp plant that email?

898
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,780
No, I'm kidding.

899
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:44,780
That's great.

900
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,180
They'd be very happy to hear that, and I think that's what they're trying to do, so it's

901
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,180
great.

902
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:55,860
I also do think there are a few trusted emulation sites that I know of I'm not gonna go into them on the air right now

903
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:00,680
But you you really do if you're new into the emulation scene

904
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,700
You really do have to wade through piles of crap before you get to the good stuff, you know

905
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:09,520
So I actually think I think that that is a fabulous idea and on top of that

906
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,660
I think that a lot of the older games that we're seeing through game tap had a lot more

907
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:22,220
value to them. These were games where they could not focus on graphics. These were games

908
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:27,020
that had solid gameplay. A lot of the ones that are up on there. A lot of the classics.

909
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:32,980
I swear, I watch Rob play it all the time and I'm very impressed. If I had the money,

910
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:39,100
I would subscribe to it. But I mean, it's very well done.

911
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:43,160
really I'm actually thinking of doing it if it wasn't that I was in school right

912
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:47,440
now I would totally do it but I after the show I get to go home and paint some

913
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:54,360
more hey um two more all right one of them's from Sakarina hi Sakarina we

914
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:02,680
like Sakarina hello Sakarina and this has to do with the gate removal thing oh

915
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,960
and Animal Crossing yes right from what I've read on various gaming blogs the

916
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,320
removal of gates is caused by a glitch having something to do with pitfall seeds

917
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,760
I've read this couple places do and therefore anyone who falls into a pitfall

918
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,320
somewhere in town could trigger this glitch to remove the gate I thought that

919
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,280
that would be cleared up in case one of the people in our friend code thread

920
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:29,480
happened to have it happen to them and for the record we do have an open forum

921
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,800
on our website in our forum section for our Animal Crossing players to share

922
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,280
friend codes and when you'll have your gate open and blah blah blah okay last

923
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:50,760
one from Mike hi Mike Mike is awesome um he said you GM did a top 200 games on

924
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,120
their list for their 200th issue mm-hmm I actually I needed to grab that issue

925
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,880
of EGM because I sort of got it out of EGM but I every so often I pick him up

926
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:06,020
there was just to see what's going on but now these were their top 10 games

927
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:12,200
was number 10 was Pong 9 was Grand Theft Auto 3 8 was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of

928
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:17,320
Time he said it should be number one 7 was Space Invaders 6 was Super Mario 64

929
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:24,100
5 Legend of Zelda 4 Tetris 2 sorry 3 Street Fighter 2 2 Pac-Man 1 Super

930
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:28,400
Mario Brothers I saw that I actually read the magazine the other day that's a

931
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,800
pretty good list I'm pretty happy with that list as compared to most of these

932
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,160
top games of all time lists the only one I I'm not big on the Mario 64 as a lot

933
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,960
of people are I don't know why I love Mario 64 but I also have I wouldn't put

934
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,720
into my top 10 I have very fond memories of it I know I know a lot of other

935
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,760
people really into it's just not not my honorable mentions sure 12 Metal Gear

936
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,200
Solid 17 Halo 46 Resident Evil 4 74 Chrono Trigger that should be much

937
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,980
further up there yeah 92 Super Smash Brothers Melee 196 Guitar Hero which has

938
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:07,580
been played non-stop in my house all day 178 DDR 172 Katamari Damacy no

939
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:13,560
version of Puyo Puyo at all and that is a crying shame no Final Fantasy mentions

940
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,740
well I'm sure it's in the list it's gotta be somewhere but I'm kind of

941
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:21,240
surprised Final Fantasy 7 didn't crack the top 10 a little bit no Puyo Puyo and I

942
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,860
you have to have been paying attention to know that I am like this uber peel

943
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:30,600
peel fan yeah you know we had it as peel pop dr. robotics mean bean machine

944
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:36,600
Kirby's avalanche huh that breaks my heart but I'm closing the mailbag all

945
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:41,200
right pulling the strings mailbag orange laundry calm if you want to send us some

946
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:46,440
email and and we might read your email on the air if we feel like it one thing

947
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,840
that also seems like it's gonna happen whenever somebody feels like it is Duke

948
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Duke Nukem Forever.

949
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,560
Loki, what the heck is going on with Duke Nukem Forever?

950
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,920
If you believe it or not, it's actually still being worked on.

951
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:08,080
Right now, they had an interview, I believe it was on 1UP, talking to a co-founder of

952
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:15,480
3D Realms, and basically in the interview, they brought up Duke Nukem Forever, and actually

953
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,680
it says that a lot of it's been finished, all the guns are finished, and most of the

954
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,460
creatures are finished, and it's basically they're putting together the pieces.

955
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:28,280
So they said it's possible, it's possible, you know, cross your fingers, you might see

956
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:33,480
Duke Nukem 3, or um, forever, coming out in 2006.

957
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,260
Possible, we'll see.

958
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:40,680
I'm looking at chat room feedback to the top 200 list right now, over at orange-not-a-trader.com,

959
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,680
click on chat.

960
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:47,680
Maniac 64 says Metroid Prime, Super Metroid. I think Super Metroid's the game I would have

961
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,000
had in the top 10 instead of Mario 64. Metroid Prime was in the top 200, though. Super Metroid

962
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,040
needs to be one of those emulated games. Super Metroid needs to be recognized as one of the

963
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,640
best video games of all time. It really is. It's an incredible game. I think it was in

964
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,760
the list, though, too. I also have very positive memories of Super Metroid because I would

965
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,700
lay on the couch and watch Dan play all the way through it, and that was together time

966
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,700
over video games.

967
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,700
Awww.

968
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,700
I love that game.

969
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,700
Shut up!

970
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,700
Any type of Metroid game is good for me.

971
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,700
Rob.

972
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,700
Rob.

973
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Rob.

974
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,700
Rob.

975
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,700
Rob.

976
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,700
Rob.

977
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,700
Rob.

978
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,700
Rob.

979
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,700
Rob.

980
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,700
Hi.

981
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,700
Hi Jamie!

982
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,700
I felt it was time to revive that.

983
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,700
It's been a standard since this episode.

984
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,900
Did I mention it's just one of those shows tonight?

985
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,340
We're just off tonight.

986
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,740
Anyway, here's a funny link I found this week.

987
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:39,480
It's on most of the major gaming sites, you'll find a link to this, but the full link is

988
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:49,620
redruth.greenbean.org slash tilde ben slash 4cr slash smb underscore super underscore

989
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,640
synth dot swf.

990
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,100
It's the Super Mario Brothers audio sound super synthesizer, and essentially what they've

991
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:01,240
done on this, and I'm playing with it right now, is they've taken all these sounds from

992
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,840
Mario Bros. and basically stripped them all out so that you can make your own remixes.

993
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,480
So I'm going to remix something right here on the air right now, so here we go.

994
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,860
Let's all do the Mario, oops I fucked up.

995
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:22,680
Let's all do the Mario, come on it's time to go, I've got a lot of coins, woo, Mario,

996
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,240
da da da, swing your hands from side to side.

997
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
See?

998
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,200
And I can do this in my room late at night when no one's watching.

999
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,560
That's the only place you should be doing that.

1000
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,560
Yeah.

1001
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,280
We'd rather not hear about anything else.

1002
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,360
Right.

1003
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,360
That subject's over.

1004
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,440
Yeah, I won't be doing any more stories since hour.

1005
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,440
Let's go over to Loki, who has something of a bit more serious nature.

1006
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,000
Yes.

1007
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,280
It's another game that's getting more flack from people, and this one is...

1008
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:04,480
basically Gun. Yes, the Association for American Indian Development calls for the Gun Boycott.

1009
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,620
And for those who are not in the know, Gun was this game that came out in November that's

1010
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:13,200
basically kind of a wild west version of Grand Theft Auto. It had a story line about a guy

1011
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:19,760
who was part Indian who was basically scalping people and what not. What's funny though is

1012
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,500
they fail to mention that actually in the game the Native Americans are portrayed very

1013
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:32,240
positively and also it's very accurate to the time period, the actions in the game.

1014
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,980
But anyways, that doesn't stop them from wanting a boycott. Basically they said the slaughtering

1015
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:42,560
of renegade Apaches, the atrocity of the Indian scalping and the misinformation of Indian

1016
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,300
traditions of killing sacred white animals. The petition requests that Activision remove

1017
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:53,660
all derogatory harmful and inaccurate depictions of American Indians from gun

1018
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:58,080
and reissue the game not gonna happen because the game's like twenty nine

1019
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,200
dollars right now

1020
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,780
and if they could sell it cheaper they probably would. It wasn't a very good game.

1021
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:09,100
Just so you know. Alright. On a completely different note,

1022
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,580
you know when you work for a game company you have to sign what's called

1023
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,800
an NDA, a non-disclosure agreement.

1024
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,540
Dark Sakura, tell us about the dark side of NDA's. What happens when...

1025
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,780
Are they drug out in the street and shot? What happens when people violate those NDAs?

1026
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,780
Usually just fired.

1027
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:29,500
But there was a

1028
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:33,180
former employee of Sony Online Entertainment that was

1029
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:38,540
he spoke out about criticizing the PlayStation 3 and was

1030
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:42,940
fired. He was an artist, Josh Robinson.

1031
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:45,980
Just to give a quote here, all I really did was write a few paragraphs that gave my

1032
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:46,540
opinion

1033
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:51,500
on publicly released information. I didn't reveal any tech info. I didn't

1034
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,060
reveal

1035
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:56,780
different shipping plans. I'm still in awe of the whole uproar over

1036
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,220
what

1037
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:03,000
amounts to no information. Basically posted in this blog that says our game just

1038
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,900
keeps getting moved back and back and back

1039
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,500
and where is the box? Where is the final system? When is it coming out? No one knows

1040
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,100
and in the meantime people in the industry are starting to get just a little salty.

1041
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:18,760
You could always tell where the PS3 dev box was because it's the room that had the f-bomb coming out of it half the day

1042
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:24,380
But he basically got got sacked for it

1043
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:30,580
Another quote here. I talked with the people on the technical side of the Xbox 360 the consistent comment

1044
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:34,140
I am hearing from people on my end is the Xbox 360 is better. Oh

1045
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:39,660
Snap they are saying that it is capable of just doing more

1046
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:46,820
He also talked to at least two Sony employees who read the blog entry before it was posted

1047
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:51,060
and showed it to a producer and he said, again another quote, we were all in agreement that

1048
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:56,100
I was not breaking NDA with what I was saying.

1049
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,140
They were just upset that he was bad-knouthing him.

1050
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,420
Yeah, I think it's more one of those two.

1051
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,240
Tried to find something to sack him with since he opened his mouth and was critical.

1052
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,620
How dare he?

1053
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,180
How dare he speak the minds of everybody about this subject?

1054
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:14,100
And might I be the first to say the Xbox 360 can be more powerful than the PlayStation

1055
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,100
3 all at once, but it's going to have to work first.

1056
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,260
There's a little bit more.

1057
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,260
Just another quote.

1058
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,220
It says, it was something unfortunate to happen.

1059
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,300
I sincerely hope Sony isn't damaged by it.

1060
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:28,560
In fact, I cannot say enough nice things about the CEO and VP of the company.

1061
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,900
Did I knowingly break NDA?

1062
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,380
I absolutely did not.

1063
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,420
I would never do that and would never want to hurt Sony online.

1064
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,580
Did I dance in the gray area by even opening my mouth?

1065
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,140
Yes I did and I was fired for it.

1066
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:42,220
He did say however that he received four or five job offers immediately after leaving

1067
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:45,020
Sony and got a book deal as a result of the article.

1068
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,020
Loser.

1069
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,020
What?

1070
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,020
Loser.

1071
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,020
Why?

1072
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,440
Well first off he's contradicted himself in his own quotes.

1073
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:57,420
He says we haven't seen a dev kit or anything like that and he also says that the Xbox 360

1074
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,420
is capable of more.

1075
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,360
How do you know it's capable of more if you haven't received the final kit yet?

1076
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,040
He said that, from what I read, that his group hasn't received a dev kit.

1077
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,400
They did say there was a dev kit because of all the cursing coming from the room it was

1078
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,400
located in.

1079
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,320
Yeah, but it's not a final system yet.

1080
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,320
That doesn't mean anything.

1081
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,880
They don't even have any working, you know, demos.

1082
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,720
They're all just live renders and that's it.

1083
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,560
So I think it's a bunch of crap.

1084
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,960
I think someone's bitter because someone bad mouthed Sony and got fired for it.

1085
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,520
Oh, book deal.

1086
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,520
Good for you.

1087
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,840
I don't think anyone's going to be buying that one.

1088
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,720
Actually, I do believe it is a state law that as long as you do not break your NDA, you

1089
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,960
are entitled to state whatever you want to as long as you are not using your company's

1090
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,080
facilities to do it.

1091
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,720
As long as you are posting this as yourself through your own private means.

1092
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,800
That's actually in several HR handbooks for different companies I've worked for within

1093
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,800
the state.

1094
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,760
At the same time, if he's not a contracted worker, though, most companies have policies

1095
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,400
that we can terminate your employment for any reason we feel like.

1096
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:01,760
But saying that they were doing it over breaking NDA, I think that that's a bit extreme.

1097
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,040
The last quote on here is, I guess the new rule for me is don't ever say anything about

1098
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,040
anything.

1099
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,040
Ever.

1100
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
Ever.

1101
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
Oops.

1102
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,040
Too late.

1103
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,040
When in doubt, keep your mouth shut.

1104
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,280
Gee, you thought that wasn't a bad idea?

1105
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,560
I mean, come on.

1106
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,560
I know.

1107
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:22,240
In retrospect, I think that it was a really bad idea for him to speak out about it because,

1108
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:28,320
mean seriously he works for a company that he had his post pre-screened but

1109
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,960
that's not gonna do anything I mean that would be like almost as dumb as saying I

1110
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:37,000
didn't think yelling that I had a bomb in an airport was a bad thing come on I

1111
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,480
checked with the airport this is okay I was just exercising my you know freedom

1112
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,640
of speech all right let's move on speaking of freedom of speech not really

1113
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,940
though extra for one reason we had to have you on the show tonight is because

1114
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:56,080
you you watch American Idol an awful lot right I love you some American Idol I

1115
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,180
don't but I still watch it it's like crack I don't know why did you catch the

1116
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:04,220
video game somewhat video game or at least anime related reference on

1117
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,940
American Idol this week I didn't get this there was this guy who auditioned

1118
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:12,100
on American Idol check out what he did for his audition

1119
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:18,780
What is up with Austin, man?

1120
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:22,620
Yes, he sang the Jigglypuff song for his audition.

1121
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:26,100
You remember the Jigglypuff, like from Pokemon, they'd sing the song and put everybody to

1122
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,220
sleep and then you'd draw on your face with a marker?

1123
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,340
What the hell was he thinking?

1124
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,700
He just wanted to be on TV.

1125
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:33,700
TV time.

1126
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:38,700
Remember, in Super Smash Brothers Melee, the sleep attack is the most powerful attack in

1127
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,700
the game.

1128
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,700
It's true.

1129
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,740
bitch anything though that was creative editing like maybe he like the producers

1130
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:47,280
got him to do that and then like spliced in the reaction do that all I know him

1131
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:52,740
on though they do that stuff that show so fake it is we're not everybody that

1132
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:56,700
shows up at those locations get picked reject reject fault icons right Jamie

1133
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:04,060
yes all of them and set them on fire all right unless they're crack in that case

1134
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:08,420
watch American Idol and hate it every minute of it but still watch it Loki

1135
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:12,500
take us to a new topic what's going on with Dragon Quest it's selling like hot

1136
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:18,460
cakes the Dragon Quest series actually Dragon Quest 8 has crossed the four

1137
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:24,100
million units mark of worldwide shipments and this figure also includes

1138
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:30,420
430,000 shipped to US making it probably one of the best RPGs sold last year

1139
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:35,060
anyways of course this means that the future of the Dragon Quest series in

1140
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:41,060
America is very bright and of course they are planning on doing more sequels

1141
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:46,340
as well as you do have the Dragon Quest Yargas coming out here pretty soon so

1142
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:54,060
Sounds good! I could definitely use another RPG series. Sounds good.

1143
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:57,700
You know Dragon Quest is a game that was really big in Japan of course like huge

1144
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,660
huge series in Japan that's now catching on over here but that takes us into the

1145
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:06,460
final story for this segment why is it the Japanese games do well over here but

1146
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:10,420
American games don't do so hot over there I was reading a joystick with a Q

1147
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:14,420
this week and they were talking about you know some talk on the internet about

1148
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:20,940
this stuff saying basically that if you notice the top 100 best-selling games in

1149
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:28,780
Japan for 2005 only one of them was made for America in comparison the u.s. market

1150
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:34,040
has a much greater demand for Japanese titles.

1151
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,860
The article goes on to say, the cause of this problem appears to be the result of a combination

1152
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,380
of ignorance and apathy from American publishers towards the Japanese market.

1153
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:46,300
Whereas Japanese publishers are willing to go the extra mile and carry out excellent

1154
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,480
localizations, their American counterparts seem reluctant to even bother getting their

1155
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,760
games translated to Japanese.

1156
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:57,860
As a result, the Japanese market is flooded with a multitude of bad American titles mixed

1157
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:00,640
in with the gains that the Japanese public should be buying.

1158
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,640
Thoughts?

1159
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,640
That's America's fault.

1160
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,640
Thoughts?

1161
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,640
That's been happening for years.

1162
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,580
I mean, it's just been going on.

1163
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:16,600
They're relying on, you know, if it's from the fact from a corporate standpoint that

1164
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,680
they're saying business-wise there is this apathy and they are not taking any steps to

1165
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,360
change it, well, of course, it's going to stay the same.

1166
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:31,000
gonna have no incentive because based on numbers there hasn't been any past

1167
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,440
precedent to try to tailor the games to the Japanese market if they're not

1168
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:40,140
buying them anyway but I think that as typical with corporate America they

1169
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:45,800
don't seem to realize the reason behind it all they see are their figures good

1170
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:53,260
point okay anything you want to yeah we just have to you know look at the games

1171
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,740
or the movies and stuff that are coming out over here.

1172
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:00,400
I mean that's a perfect example of the difference between Japanese and

1173
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,400
American stuff. You've got really crappy video game movies coming out, I mean, and

1174
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,080
then look at

1175
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,440
Japanese market, they have really kick-ass, you know, movies based on

1176
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,660
anime series and games and whatnot.

1177
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:15,240
But yeah, American movies do very well in Japan. Isn't Titanic their highest grossing

1178
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:15,840
movie too?

1179
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,160
Yeah, but the whole thing is though, let's look at some of these games that are coming out over here.

1180
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:19,640
Okay, like

1181
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,000
Forza Motorsport or something like that, a very American game.

1182
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,080
didn't do so well over in Japan because it, you know,

1183
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,320
or not Forza, what am I thinking of?

1184
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:33,020
Project Ophthalm 3 did really well over here,

1185
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:36,680
but not so well over there. Ridge Racer, you know, kicked ass over there because

1186
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:40,700
Ridge Racer is just clearly a better game anyways. But now,

1187
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:44,480
the whole thing is, I think people, it's like,

1188
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,880
ooh, graphics, they're so amazing, the graphics are so amazing, yeah, but the

1189
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,080
game sucks.

1190
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:54,400
that's the problem is need we need to focus more on gameplay over here in

1191
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,000
America

1192
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,040
whereas you know right now we're focusing on who can you make the coolest

1193
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,600
graphics and you know

1194
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,920
sound stuff like that we just completely lose sight on

1195
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,680
the game being good. There's been some good games to come out of here though some

1196
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,240
excellent stuff World of Warcraft

1197
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:13,040
uh Halo yeah those games are doing you know pretty well

1198
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,800
Grand Theft Auto I don't think that does well over there does I have no idea

1199
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,340
Well, no, probably not.

1200
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,400
Interesting.

1201
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,360
But they probably don't do much to localize it, really.

1202
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,200
No.

1203
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,040
It's kind of a tough title to localize, wouldn't it be?

1204
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,700
All right, I'm sure those of you guys in the chat room

1205
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,120
and who are listening to us on the podcast

1206
