00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:18,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, February 5th, 2006, new details emerge on the PlayStation 3.

2
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:21,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Do American games always fail in Japan?

3
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And a special ode to Kingdom Hearts.

4
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:38,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,066
[SPEAKER_06]: It is February 5th, 2006.

6
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:43,423
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:15,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello also to the one and only Loki.

8
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, how you doing?

9
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:21,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Rob!

10
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:22,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Rob!

11
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:24,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Printer sucks!

12
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:25,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me set up a little background.

13
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:29,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we're a video game show, but let's face it, we've got to talk about our personal lives once in a while too.

14
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:37,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I just bought a cheap printer today because for work I'm going down to LA on Monday and I have to fly out at 6 o'clock in the morning.

15
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:38,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm flying Southwest.

16
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:45,787
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how Southwest has those boarding pass systems where depending on what time you print your boarding pass from the internet, you get an A, B, or C pass, right?

17
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bought a printer so I could have myself an A-pass.

18
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:49,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I screwed up.

19
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you couldn't print your passes until after midnight.

20
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:57,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, like, literally 30 minutes before the show, I realized, oh, crap, you can actually print them up to 24 hours in advance.

21
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hooking up the printer in this furious frenzy, and now the damn thing won't even print.

22
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:06,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki's stuck over there because I have his computer frozen up with the boarding pass sitting there.

23
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:12,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because this wonderful printer that you bought didn't come with a black cartridge because that would have been too expensive.

24
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And the printer's like, no, I don't want to print without a black cartridge.

25
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:15,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck!

26
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:17,936
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

27
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:45,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob Ofer

28
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:17,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not talk about my personal crises for a minute.

29
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and how that's been going.

30
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:24,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll start off with a lovely DarkSakura with.

31
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:25,089
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your gaming week?

32
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm staring at the pretty precious.

33
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:39,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I have in my hands Kingdom Hearts 2, which I've been playing a little bit of enough to realize that Ruxus sucks and that I'm glad that I don't have to use him the entire game.

34
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:40,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

35
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:44,367
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting.

36
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,288
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks very, very pretty on my TV.

37
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:52,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it's still on the PS2, so it's got jaggedies all to hell and back.

38
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,733
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CG scenes look really pretty.

39
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,994
[SPEAKER_01]: I loves me some Kingdom Hearts.

40
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:58,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

41
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:02,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also been playing lots of Animal Crossing, of course.

42
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:09,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dan picked up Maverick Hunter X, the Mega Man X remake.

43
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:11,910
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's pretty damn cool.

44
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they completely redid the game for the PSP.

45
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:16,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fabulous.

46
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:23,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you beat the game, you get to get this little sort of OAV of how things led up to the situation.

47
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:28,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the dubbing in it is not horrendous, which surprises the hell out of me.

48
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,880
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very well done.

49
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very pleased.

50
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:39,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can play as the first guy that you fight, whose name eludes me at present, but he looks like Boba Fett.

51
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:42,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the Japanese copy that you have?

52
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:43,492
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the American one.

53
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

54
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:50,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Maverick Hunter?

55
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:52,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Maverick Hunter, never mind.

56
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:58,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was wondering how I was playing it then purchased at a GameStop.

57
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,081
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

58
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,482
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I was talking about Kingdom Hearts.

59
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:03,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to the boarding pass, Loki, make it work.

60
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:06,350
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Kingdom Hearts?

61
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,151
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Japanese one.

62
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is the Japanese one.

63
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:09,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay, I'm up to speed.

64
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:10,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is the Japanese one.

65
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does that, um, how is that?

66
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:15,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it beautiful?

67
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:17,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it was pretty, but jaggedy.

68
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I mean, just, you can understand.

69
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:20,162
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

70
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,763
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually plays more like Devil May Cry.

71
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:22,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

72
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:33,773
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you want to play this game on as hard of a level as you can, or you will not level up high enough to beat Sephiroth by the time you get to him.

73
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:35,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Puzzle Fighter Game Boy Micro

74
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:31,357
[SPEAKER_01]: which when you're sitting in a waiting room having your eye checked out after it is swollen from an allergic reaction to a dog which I will be getting to later on in the show and your eye is in searing, throbbing pain it's very hard to look at a Game Boy micro screen I tortured myself for my art alright, that it?

75
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:32,937
[SPEAKER_01]: my eye still looks like I got punched in it

76
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:34,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even notice.

77
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, a little bit.

78
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,224
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that bad.

79
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:41,825
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's not as bad as it was Friday because I looked like a Romero reject.

80
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:47,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all like red bloodshot and then like that clear green that they only give zombies.

81
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:49,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

82
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:52,108
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I looked like a Romero reject.

83
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means we have to cut off her head.

84
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,610
[SPEAKER_01]: No, which is, nobody in this room is in any danger of me eating their brain.

85
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's refreshing.

86
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:01,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

87
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, I'm glad.

88
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:02,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

89
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a night elf, a level 38 night elf

90
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:37,386
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Malfurion server, and I also have a level 29 druid on the Spinebreaker server that I've been playing with.

91
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are mucho fun to play with, let me tell you.

92
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:45,156
[SPEAKER_03]: How are the guilds that you've been joining up in the game?

93
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:45,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of drama.

94
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:51,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear, I didn't know that all of this drama in the world of video games existed.

95
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,174
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of drama queens in World of Warcraft.

96
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.

97
00:07:56,075 --> 00:08:04,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I got invited to a guild not too long ago on the Spinebreaker server, and the leader kept on giving me gifts or whatever.

98
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,443
[SPEAKER_03]: He was enticing me with gifts.

99
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:07,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

100
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:13,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly, like, last night I'm playing, and I knew that there was a little bit of drama.

101
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:17,429
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't have anything to do with me or anything like that in the guild.

102
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And two people were kicked off recently.

103
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:23,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the leader himself left, the guy who invited me.

104
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:28,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, you know, I didn't even talk to anybody really on that guild anyway.

105
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:31,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only guy I talked to was the guy who was giving me things.

106
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:34,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, you know, screw this guild.

107
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:35,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And I left.

108
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:37,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Shane invited me to his.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,761
[SPEAKER_03]: or Miklatov, which you guys all know.

110
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:42,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was here last week.

111
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff.

112
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:47,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Exciting.

113
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:48,543
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

114
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:53,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you want to stop fighting with my new printer for a minute to tell us about your gaming week?

115
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,285
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I will.

116
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:56,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

117
00:08:57,865 --> 00:08:58,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play too much.

118
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:07,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Ridge Racer 6 a lot, as well as some more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories and a little bit of Animal Crossing.

119
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,591
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's pretty much it.

120
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:12,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't play too much Call of Duty, really busy week, so.

121
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of Ridge Racer though, I love that game.

122
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having a little bit of an off night tonight, if you can't tell.

123
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't you had an off week?

124
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Kinda, you know, there's more drama.

125
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me talk about my gaming week, because there's even more drama.

126
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:28,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what games have you not been playing, Rob?

127
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,298
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be anything on the Xbox 360.

128
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:32,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow, what happened?

129
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me talk about what happened.

130
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my Xbox 360 this week.

131
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

132
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally found the Xbox 360.

133
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:52,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I used the Best Buy locator thing that we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago, and I found out that a Best Buy had the Xbox 360 in stock, so I ran over there to a Best Buy, and they were out of premiums already at that point, but I managed to score myself a core system.

134
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:52,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

135
00:09:53,576 --> 00:10:09,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bought a core system and the clerk was really nice and she gave me, it was really weird, like she had little slips of paper that had core written on it and the manager's signature and I had to take that up to the counter to get one of the core systems unlocked out of the gate and get my little core system to take home and play.

136
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, cool.

137
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And I picked up Cameo and Dead or Alive 4.

138
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:19,525
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

139
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a beautiful looking game.

140
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,721
[SPEAKER_01]: It has lots of boobs.

141
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:41,241
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.

142
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,141
[SPEAKER_06]: It has lots of boobs.

143
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:44,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And the environments are huge.

144
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the stages in that game.

145
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:47,305
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so great.

146
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like free walking anywhere.

147
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Mexican wrestler.

148
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:52,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Does he have boobs?

149
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:52,788
[SPEAKER_00]: She.

150
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:53,469
[SPEAKER_00]: No, she.

151
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:54,369
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes.

152
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the all-American girl with the huge knockers.

153
00:10:58,892 --> 00:10:59,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Tina.

154
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:00,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I like her.

155
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:00,833
[SPEAKER_06]: She was my favorite.

156
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:03,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And her dad, Hulk Hogan.

157
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,316
[SPEAKER_06]: My best character, though, was the geisha.

158
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:06,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Kokoro or whatever.

159
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:07,658
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the best.

160
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Her name means heart.

161
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:09,787
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

162
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all had mega boobs?

163
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they all had mega boobs.

164
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:13,711
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

165
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:13,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

166
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, Dead or Alive 4, awesome.

167
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:15,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So pretty.

168
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the problem.

169
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and I download stuff on Xbox Arcade, too, like Joust, which was awesome.

170
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Joust co-op online in battle.

171
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:28,324
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun.

172
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played... What else did I download on there?

173
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:36,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Geometry Wars, which was a lot of fun, too.

174
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like what everybody says.

175
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:37,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so much fun.

176
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:39,373
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

177
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:04,046
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the little lights in the lower right-hand corner is flashing red.

178
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:07,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I look at the TV, and it says, System Error.

179
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Contact Microsoft Support.

180
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:10,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Code E74.

181
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, the fuck?

182
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:14,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I just bought this thing.

183
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:15,533
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is wrong with it?

184
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:17,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, okay, you know what?

185
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:20,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's just a bad time.

186
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just let it rest.

187
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:21,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try it again.

188
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:22,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So I let it rest, tried again.

189
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:23,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Still didn't work.

190
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Unplugged all the cords, replugged them all back in.

191
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Still didn't work.

192
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:31,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, okay, maybe my system's not getting enough ventilation, so I'll put it out in the open.

193
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:36,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, unplug all the cords, totally resituate my Xbox 360, plug it back in, still doesn't work.

194
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, maybe my Xbox 360's just being moody.

195
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, okay, fine, I'll try this again Friday when I get home from work.

196
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:47,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So I tried again Friday when I get home from work, still nothing, still broken.

197
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even a day and a half after owning my Xbox 360, it broke, and it has not worked since.

198
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:02,960
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not one of those like reading it on the internet where, oh, look at some poor schmuck who their Xbox 360 broke right off the bat.

199
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,920
[SPEAKER_06]: It was me.

200
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:04,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

201
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:06,441
[SPEAKER_06]: My Xbox 360 broke.

202
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do anything to it.

203
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:11,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't move it between the last time I played it because I went to a friend's house, came back, and powered it on.

204
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:12,842
[SPEAKER_06]: The same place it was.

205
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:15,723
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nothing possible I could have done to break this system.

206
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the Coke spilled on it.

207
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:18,623
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not even that.

208
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the lemonade.

209
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:21,304
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nothing.

210
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:23,124
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say lemonade, I mean...

211
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:24,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

212
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:31,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, no, I was just going to say, you know, I know, I know.

213
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And your reaction was priceless because you were laughing.

214
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:41,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I thought you would be just like, you know, scary, you know, moody Rob, but you were actually like,

215
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:42,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe this.

216
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was disbelief or something like that.

217
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:56,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, like most of you out there, I'd read the stories on Joystick and Dig and Kotaku about, you know, oh, these poor bastards, their Xbox 360s broke right after they bought them, and, huh, happened to me!

218
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you have to wait for a box.

219
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:28,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only thing you're really going to be able to do is send it back so we can take a look at it and work on it.

220
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:29,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole process takes a week.

221
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:36,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Because obviously they have this thing down to a science right now, fixing these broken Xboxes, because apparently there's a ton of them out there.

222
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:42,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm now waiting for a box to come to me from Microsoft so I can send back my Xbox 360.

223
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:47,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So, everybody out there... Do not play with the box.

224
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:47,456
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

225
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:50,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Take what happened to me as a lesson.

226
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:51,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly.

227
00:14:52,782 --> 00:15:07,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Think twice before you buy an Xbox 360 because obviously Microsoft has tons of issues right now and I'm sorry if I sound a little bitter but I am because I spent like $500 of my hard earned money on this system and the cords and the games and all that garbage for nothing.

228
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,183
[SPEAKER_06]: The damn thing broke.

229
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:11,266
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

230
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I did nothing.

231
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:33,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an intelligent gamer.

232
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:36,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing games since God knows when.

233
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:39,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what to do and what not to do with the system.

234
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:40,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I know do not put a new system.

235
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:43,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't put it on top of other things so you can't ventilate.

236
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do anything bad with the system.

237
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:46,749
[SPEAKER_06]: The system was faulty from the start.

238
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:53,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I'm wondering though if it's not just something simple wrong with it because usually it's the three lights flashing that's bad.

239
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,573
[SPEAKER_08]: One light flashing, I'm not sure.

240
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:56,413
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like

241
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:58,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Code Red, Code Yellow

242
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:24,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, but I think I have a reason to be.

243
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:26,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you saved up your moodiness for tonight.

244
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:26,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

245
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:31,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now, and this whole printer malfunction thing just has me even more on edge with the whole thing.

246
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,178
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you get for rearranging my stuff.

247
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:34,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

248
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not in a good mood now.

249
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:37,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

250
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:38,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Angsty.

251
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:39,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Hate.

252
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:39,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Rage.

253
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:40,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire.

254
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:40,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn.

255
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash comfort.

256
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:44,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Slash burninate Microsoft.

257
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so mad.

258
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:50,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll be in a better mood once the damn thing's fixed.

259
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:51,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going out of town tomorrow.

260
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, that's what you get for playing with a box.

261
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:00,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to some gaming news.

262
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:01,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about something else.

263
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:05,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to open with an Xbox 360 story tonight because I'm a little pissy.

264
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:07,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to open with something else.

265
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:09,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody give me a story on something else.

266
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:13,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, please tell me you have a story not related to Xbox 360.

267
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so anyways, with the 360, no.

268
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:17,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah!

269
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,004
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a story talking about the Revolution and it's low, low prices.

270
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:27,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So crazy.

271
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:34,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Analysts say that the Revolution is supposed to be priced between $200 and $250, which is pretty cool.

272
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of what we already figured though.

273
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:43,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, Revolution will be launched likely by November.

274
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking good, especially since all the other systems out there cost

275
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:51,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Over, you know, $400, so that's not good.

276
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:57,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, $299 for a core system that doesn't even come with the frickin' cords that I need for my TV.

277
00:17:57,268 --> 00:18:08,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, $299, but you need a lot of stuff in order to... I love how only with the core system do you get the ever-rare composite cables minus the S-Video.

278
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,134
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want S-Video, you gotta pay another $29.99.

279
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:10,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

280
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:11,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Not happy.

281
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:14,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Not happy.

282
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:22,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, if I sound anti-Microsoft tonight, usually I try to be very unbiased when it comes to this whole thing.

283
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:29,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say overall our listener base, because I'm watching the chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

284
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:32,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And our listener base, usually they dog on Microsoft.

285
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:34,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see too many people dogging on Sony or Nintendo.

286
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:37,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually I stick up for Microsoft.

287
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:39,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say, you know what, let's be fair to all the systems.

288
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:40,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And Microsoft does that.

289
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, tonight, free reign.

290
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:43,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Bash Microsoft all you want.

291
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:43,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

292
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:44,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm turning a blind eye to it.

293
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:45,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

294
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:48,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, do you care?

295
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:52,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Let him bash Microsoft tonight.

296
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:52,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

297
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:53,189
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

298
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:54,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine works.

299
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:54,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

300
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:55,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine doesn't.

301
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, I'm angry.

302
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:00,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I bring mine to work every day.

303
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I open my wound a little more so you can pour some more salt in there?

304
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:10,754
[SPEAKER_08]: My box is inside of a bag out there and I actually bring it and toss it in the back of my car every day.

305
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:12,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

306
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:15,756
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of those rare cases that it worked.

307
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to stick that fucking ferret in the box.

308
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put Senior Burrito in the box.

309
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get how they don't know what's wrong with it.

310
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:24,154
[SPEAKER_08]: They're supposed to be spending more time on quality control.

311
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:29,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if maybe Joe Quality Control was taking a break when your Xbox came down the line.

312
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:33,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he was taking a piss and that's why Rob's Xbox doesn't work.

313
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,800
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked for a little bit.

314
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what I don't get about the Xbox problems.

315
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:41,123
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be playing the system fine.

316
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:41,823
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut it off.

317
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, everything's peachy.

318
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:44,164
[SPEAKER_08]: You come back.

319
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:44,885
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't turn on.

320
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:46,116
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

321
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,797
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like, the Xbox can't break itself when you're not playing it.

322
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's really stupid.

323
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Just know that you're supposed to watch water sports on the TV with your Xbox 360.

324
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:04,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Not actually use your Xbox 360, you know, in the whole...

325
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see some of the fury in the chatroom.

326
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:12,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if I have any supporters in chat right now.

327
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at chatroom here.

328
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:13,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

329
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:17,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight says, Rob, it had Windows 3.1 in it.

330
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:18,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

331
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:19,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

332
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:20,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

333
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:21,710
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we have?

334
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,911
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Rini says, In communist Russia, 360 breaks you.

335
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:32,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that George Bush runs on Windows.

336
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:35,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Jaded2006 says, Actually, I'm only biased to Microsoft.

337
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:36,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And tonight, I don't care.

338
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

339
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:37,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

340
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Be more towards Microsoft.

341
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:42,692
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkLionXVI says, That's why I never buy anything Microsoft.

342
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:46,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and now here we go.

343
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:46,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

344
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:47,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see.

345
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Tony is saying, I will dog on Sony.

346
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:53,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And says, Luminous overrated.

347
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:55,778
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP square button hurt.

348
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini also wants to know, does Sky have a period tonight?

349
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:01,222
[SPEAKER_06]: If I do, I have a good reason.

350
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,264
[SPEAKER_03]: He has PMS all the time.

351
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:05,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't read too much into it.

352
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:07,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob has PMS.

353
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting up with Microsoft shit.

354
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:09,567
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

355
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:10,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

356
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Bravo.

357
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:13,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I shake your hand, lady.

358
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty good.

359
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Smartest thing ever said on this show.

360
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:17,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

361
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:19,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said plenty of smart things.

362
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,394
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I said smartest thing ever said on this show.

363
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,231
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, speaking of Sony.

364
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do we invite you on this show, Extover?

365
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:25,872
[SPEAKER_06]: We know it's going to go down the toilet when...

366
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:50,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every so often we need bleached asshole humor.

367
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Because tonight I don't care.

368
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care tonight.

369
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:55,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob is Mr. PMS apathy.

370
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:56,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Let this be a bad show.

371
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:57,123
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll match my mood.

372
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:57,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

373
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:58,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

374
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:03,928
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, save us and make this a quality show with a good story on Sony.

375
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:06,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony and Microsoft recently... Oh.

376
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:08,831
Kill!

377
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:12,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

378
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:16,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we've got news about the PS3.

379
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:17,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

380
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray, PS3, my butt.

381
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:20,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

382
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:21,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it work?

383
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:23,461
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be exciting news.

384
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:29,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we will be hearing interesting things about the current dev kits, but that's coming up in a little bit.

385
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:42,545
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making a new online service called the PlayStation Network that's supposed to take basically what Xbox Live is doing and take it another step.

386
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:48,046
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be an iTunes-like store that you can download films and music from.

387
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,427
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the console as a location free player.

388
00:22:52,368 --> 00:23:00,275
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can upload stuff from your PS3 onto your PSP and watch Blu-ray and DVD movies on your handheld.

389
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:03,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the PS3 will act as a digital video recorder.

390
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:08,942
[SPEAKER_01]: You can save your television programs like you would with TiVo.

391
00:23:09,982 --> 00:23:13,345
[SPEAKER_01]: You also would be able to control the DVR function using your PSP.

392
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:20,450
[SPEAKER_01]: As announced earlier, it'll play Blu-ray, but that's not going to really affect the price all that much.

393
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,190
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to...

394
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:37,844
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that the Cell and RSX were going to be able to take care of most of it, so instead of paying the big prices you would for just a Blu-ray machine, instead you're just going to pay pretty much top console price, where you're looking at.

395
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we haven't gotten an official word on what exactly that price is going to be.

396
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:54,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Other couple things is that the dev kit was running faster than they predicted and that there are a bunch of games in development that they're putting out publicly for now.

397
00:23:56,134 --> 00:24:00,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the PS3 should be getting regular firmware functionality updates like the PSP does.

398
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:11,217
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing nice I'll say about Microsoft for the 24 hours or so that my system worked, I actually really liked how you could go online and download trailers.

399
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:18,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have a high-def TV, so I downloaded the X-Men 3 trailer and the Mission Impossible 3 trailer and watched it on the TV.

400
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought it was beautiful.

401
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:21,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no pixelation or anything.

402
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:22,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was great.

403
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:31,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So hearing that Sony is developing something similar, especially when you consider that Sony also has a major movie outlet and stuff with their iTunes-style store, that sounds pretty exciting to me.

404
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:36,526
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also another thing that was stated, which a few people I'm sure should find exciting.

405
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:38,406
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.

406
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:41,147
[SPEAKER_01]: developers have been told to prepare for a fall release.

407
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:54,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be sometime this year, which means that everywhere else in the world will have to wait until, what, summer 2007, while Japan has been playing it for most of the year.

408
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have anything to add to this story about PlayStation 3?

409
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll be lucky to see it this year.

410
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:01,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

411
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:02,768
[SPEAKER_06]: What makes you say that?

412
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:03,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

413
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:03,528
[SPEAKER_08]: You think so?

414
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:37,717
[SPEAKER_08]: People need to realize that just because it's a new console system does not mean that they need to pay $60 per game for stuff.

415
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:39,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wait a couple weeks and it'll go used.

416
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:44,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other comments on PlayStation 3?

417
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:45,599
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys excited?

418
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:48,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to be excited.

419
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm containing my excitement.

420
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish it would come out this year.

421
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the longer they wait, it's kind of...

422
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:55,719
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

423
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:56,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I've learned.

424
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,622
[SPEAKER_06]: If they'll release a system that works, it's worth the wait.

425
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:00,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the race.

426
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:02,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Which will come out first?

427
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:04,166
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 or Advent Children?

428
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:06,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

429
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:07,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

430
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

431
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:09,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to a completely different topic.

432
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look.

433
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:11,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I got a Microsoft story.

434
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:12,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so excited.

435
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, not really because it's cross-platform.

436
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:21,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm specifically addressing the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of Final Fantasy XI tonight.

437
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:26,204
[SPEAKER_06]: and Final Fantasy XI recently had this big crackdown on gill sellers.

438
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:42,858
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day, folks logged in and noticed if you did a scan of some of the very popular regions where folks usually are doing their gill farming, such as Kuftal Tunnel, because that's an area where you can camp Amunet or something like that.

439
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:43,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Amimet?

440
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Amimet?

441
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:44,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Amimet?

442
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:44,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

443
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

444
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:10,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I left the game a few months ago and now they're finally cracking down on this stuff?

445
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:20,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that could have been done yesterday, I don't know if it's because of the impending Microsoft rollout that they thought, oh, maybe now's a good time to pay attention to what's going on here.

446
00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:23,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe with the expansion, or I don't know what.

447
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they don't want to hear about it at their upcoming expo, but they finally banned all these guild sellers.

448
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:29,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Good riddance!

449
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:30,591
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

450
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I did hear a rumor that the beta players would be able to transfer their characters over.

451
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:08,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, goody for them.

452
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:11,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would be cool, but I'm not going to buy it.

453
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:14,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have loved to participate in the beta, but I can't right now.

454
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:15,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Want to know why?

455
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:16,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Want to know why?

456
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:17,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I know why.

457
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:22,508
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is the beta sign-ups are over, so there's double reasons.

458
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:23,248
[SPEAKER_08]: You're double screwed.

459
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:24,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

460
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:25,470
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

461
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,471
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't miss out on anything.

462
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:31,574
[SPEAKER_08]: You loaded it up and you're like, wow, this looks exactly like the other one on the PC and on the PlayStation 2.

463
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:36,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to see it on my pretty high screen, or high screen, high def, wide screen TV.

464
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:38,562
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

465
00:28:58,641 --> 00:28:59,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a couple things.

466
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:14,867
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, gay rights groups are calling Blizzard saying you need to change your World of Warcraft policies to basically be more clear on the different types of things.

467
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:24,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the whole thing is they're saying that promoting a gay or lesbian friendly guild as harassment is just retarded and

468
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:32,061
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, understand that the rules are in place for certain things, but they're kind of, the rules are too broad.

469
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:39,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that, you know, they're using this to basically use it as it's not intended, so.

470
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,288
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

471
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:13,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they kind of have come out and said where they stand, but they really need to clarify this because they are looking a little hypocritical with the, you know, slash silly that we talked about last week.

472
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:24,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the comment was Stowall, a group founded in 1989, a professional lobbying group campaigning for the rights of lesbians and gay men and bisexuals.

473
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Their spokesperson, Jonathan Finney, said, this attempt to create a safe and gay-friendly environment should be welcomed, not blocked.

474
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:43,115
[SPEAKER_08]: and hopefully this is just a misunderstanding and would encourage Blizzard to review their policies and make sure that it has an effect or has an effect where it needs to be.

475
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:44,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been over a week now.

476
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:48,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Blizzard's ever really going to do anything else on this.

477
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:51,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're just going to kind of let this keep going.

478
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:55,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have thought if Blizzard was going to say something, we would have really heard it by now.

479
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:58,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides, you know, we did get a clarification on a message board, but it wasn't good enough.

480
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:00,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

481
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:03,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Xtifer, have a comment?

482
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:10,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to ask you, Rob, didn't you report people in the general chat?

483
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:11,338
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't.

484
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:15,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to do it, and then I couldn't really figure out.

485
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:16,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It was too complicated.

486
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I shouldn't have backed down, but I did.

487
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the thing is, aside from that, though, is that

488
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:30,096
[SPEAKER_03]: These people are saying all kinds of things in the general chat or whatever that are just really inappropriate.

489
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:31,037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just blasphemous.

490
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have any place in the game or whatever, and yet

491
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:41,230
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

492
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:02,048
[SPEAKER_06]: and so far I noticed the roleplay folks happen to be more mature.

493
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:03,528
[SPEAKER_06]: At least in my experience.

494
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:14,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It might just be the particular servers I've been picking, but in general, the roleplay server has been more mature overall and you don't get that bullshit Chuck Norris talk in the middle of town and stuff.

495
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:14,731
[SPEAKER_06]: That isn't happening.

496
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:17,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's because the server's new as well.

497
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried out a new RP server.

498
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:20,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

499
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:26,895
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be honest, the longer Blizzard goes without addressing this, I don't know how much longer I really want to keep playing this game.

500
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:33,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that in the strict RP servers, you are not allowed to be out of character.

501
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:34,337
[SPEAKER_01]: At all.

502
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:43,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get kicked, basically, if they catch you being blatantly out of character without any sort of specific comment toward being out of character.

503
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually roleplay a mute character because I don't ever talk to people.

504
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:49,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I roleplay a mute character.

505
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:51,862
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm doing a very good job, actually.

506
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I play an undead and all I say is brains.

507
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Brains.

508
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:00,666
[SPEAKER_06]: You dork.

509
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:01,246
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

510
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:07,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there another follow-up regarding the whole concepts of sexuality in this MMO, Loki?

511
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:08,109
[SPEAKER_08]: There is.

512
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,492
[SPEAKER_08]: In Blizzard, there is basically a chat log posted about

513
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:14,916
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

514
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:37,977
[SPEAKER_08]: was trying to point out where is this actually in the documents here.

515
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:53,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And the whole issue of the thing is that other players might not be mature enough and might take offense to this or start harassing other players, saying like, this night elf is camping my ass or something like that.

516
00:33:53,826 --> 00:34:08,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, their excuse is basically, well, there's some players in World of Warcraft that aren't mature enough for this game, and so they might, you know, start harassing people, so therefore we can't, you know, give them some, it's basically, you know, they're saying they're flame bait, is, yeah.

517
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:12,231
[SPEAKER_06]: So, clarify this for me, because this is something I didn't even realize.

518
00:34:12,271 --> 00:34:19,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week when I went off, I didn't even realize this, and I don't know how much longer I want to talk about this this week, but this is new news to me, so this is something new for the argument.

519
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:23,520
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying that male and female characters can get married in the game.

520
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:24,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, I guess.

521
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought sexuality had no place in World of Warcraft.

522
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:32,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently it doesn't, unless it's heterosexual.

523
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:33,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

524
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:35,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So yet another hypocrisy on Blizzard's part.

525
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:37,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, just wanted to clarify that.

526
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:38,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

527
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:46,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to mention, though, that Blizzard isn't the only MMO out there that doesn't allow gay marriage.

528
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XI, another one as well.

529
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:51,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but every Mithra on Final Fantasy XI is a gay man playing it anyway.

530
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:52,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Just teasing.

531
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:53,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't send the hate mail.

532
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Just teasing.

533
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:54,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I played one.

534
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:56,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

535
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:56,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm teasing.

536
00:34:57,647 --> 00:34:58,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you a gay man?

537
00:34:58,848 --> 00:34:59,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up!

538
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:10,671
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, seriously though, I can let that slide in that case because A, Final Fantasy XI doesn't give a crap about the GLBT guilds and all that stuff.

539
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,333
[SPEAKER_06]: They let that stuff go on and that's fine.

540
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:16,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can kind of pass it off as, you know, well, it doesn't really fit the...

541
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,882
[SPEAKER_06]: The time period of the game.

542
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:25,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm okay with that because they don't make an issue of the guilds and the other stuff.

543
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:35,176
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I have a problem with World of Warcraft because they've made an issue of all this other stuff saying sexuality has no place in the game, yet they do allow only the opposite sex marriage.

544
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:44,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Final Fantasy XI, you don't know who's really a boy and who's really a girl, so there's probably same-gender weddings happening all the time, but it's all roleplay anyway, so I've gone cross-eyed.

545
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:49,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Ami Damaru Flame says, I sent a message to an admin and I was told that's what ignore is for.

546
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:15,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a lovely response.

547
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Blizzard.

548
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet another inconsistency on Blizzard's part.

549
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what was the other one here?

550
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Robway said, the rule should be no explicit sex talk within WoW, gay, straight, or beyond.

551
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be okay with that if it was consistent.

552
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:32,075
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.

553
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:35,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, there just needs to be consistency.

554
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:39,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on, new topic.

555
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go over to Jamie.

556
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely opposite, different topic.

557
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:50,163
[SPEAKER_06]: About as far away from this whole WoW debate as we can get.

558
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:50,903
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on, DarkSakura?

559
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:55,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the entire world really gives a crap about this, but EA signed Tiger Woods for six more years.

560
00:36:57,026 --> 00:37:00,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so we will continue to have the Tiger Woods golf games and...

561
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:23,705
[SPEAKER_01]: which I don't really get because you know it would be something if they would actually sort of make changes in between the games but you know and this will probably make you happy the Xbox 360 version was supposed to be like crap they didn't it has the least amount of features to it but they have switched to like a whole analog scheme for how they're having it play but still do we need more Tiger Woods games can't he like retire like Madden did

562
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:31,162
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as the guy is popular, games with his name attached to it are going to sell.

563
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:33,744
[SPEAKER_01]: He is cute.

564
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:37,067
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a very respectable sports figure.

565
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:38,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a big sports fan.

566
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really follow any sports.

567
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything from golf to football.

568
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:44,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Notice how we're doing a show the day of the Super Bowl.

569
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:47,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, I'm not following football.

570
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:51,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Woods strikes me as one of the more respectable types of folks.

571
00:37:51,258 --> 00:37:51,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hit that.

572
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:59,294
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have to worry about what the games are going to net him because his golfing is still going to send money rolling in.

573
00:37:59,674 --> 00:38:03,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I'd rather play Happy Gilmore's PGA Tour 2006.

574
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:04,976
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a better game.

575
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:06,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

576
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:14,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

577
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:42,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo President Satoru Iwata will take time to talk about a couple new revolution details.

578
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:45,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Now doubtful he's going to actually show any games in progress.

579
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:47,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably just going to be little appetizers.

580
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Just little flavorings.

581
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,313
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll kind of let you smell what's cooking in the kitchen but won't really let you see what's going on there.

582
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:57,855
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, all the Nintendo fanboys in the world are going...

583
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:02,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't wait, just salivating for more information on the revolution.

584
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:06,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Developers Conference is the time when there will be some more hints.

585
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:10,403
[SPEAKER_06]: March 20th is the day of the Game Developers Conference.

586
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:14,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, when the news is unwrapped, we will bring it to you here on the show.

587
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And might possibly be salivating ourselves.

588
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:17,768
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

589
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360 besides them breaking?

590
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:32,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, they're working on fixing certain problems with the systems glitching out.

591
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:40,116
[SPEAKER_08]: They've actually had a firmware update or dashboard update to fix some of the guide problems that they've been having.

592
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:44,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Also increased the accuracy of the last time played thing on there.

593
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:46,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of cool, I guess.

594
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:52,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And then another great feature, disabling the kiosk disk from working anymore.

595
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:56,471
[SPEAKER_08]: So trying to stomp out more homebrew.

596
00:39:56,531 --> 00:40:04,859
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about that a couple weeks on the show, how the kiosk disk, somebody figured out how to copy it and play it on the Xbox 360, and they would say, oh, it's going to be this new way to expose homebrew.

597
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:09,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Microsoft just brought down the fist of justice on that, didn't they?

598
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:11,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes and no.

599
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:26,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they have, but no, they haven't because the actual files are on the hard drive, the update, and you could, in a sense, go back and either edit the update or delete the update and bring that all back.

600
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:34,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like a Sony firmware where you flash an actual chip and then you're screwed.

601
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:34,890
[SPEAKER_08]: You're stuck with it.

602
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, interesting.

603
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:41,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what's going on for the rest of the year?

604
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,376
[SPEAKER_06]: What other things is Xbox 360 going to do this year besides break more systems?

605
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:47,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they actually have a lot of games coming out.

606
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:47,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I sound bitter?

607
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:48,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, do I sound bitter?

608
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:50,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just a little bit.

609
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:52,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of games have been announced.

610
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,264
[SPEAKER_08]: There was actually...

611
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Far Cry Instincts Predator

612
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:18,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 2 Quake Wars

613
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:44,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Lone the Dark, more inspiration for Ruibull, and SSX4.

614
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:48,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much just a whole slew of games, a lot of tie-ins with movies.

615
00:41:49,288 --> 00:41:50,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Should be a really good year, though.

616
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:54,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be, you know what, forget it.

617
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:55,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to sound more bitter.

618
00:41:56,323 --> 00:41:57,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop being bitter.

619
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:58,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.

620
00:41:58,164 --> 00:41:58,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't help it.

621
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:00,166
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a lot of money I spent.

622
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I did have a comment regarding Yui Bull.

623
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:09,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if it had been addressed about the Metal Gear.

624
00:42:09,972 --> 00:42:11,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to talk about it.

625
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:12,594
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming up a little later.

626
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:14,421
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

627
00:42:15,902 --> 00:42:18,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go ahead and go on to the revolution.

628
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:21,964
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just ping-ponging between all the next-gen systems tonight.

629
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:22,604
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right, though.

630
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:24,104
[SPEAKER_00]: You're confusing me.

631
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:24,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

632
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:25,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

633
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:25,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Try not to go cross-eyed.

634
00:42:25,965 --> 00:42:26,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I went cross-eyed earlier.

635
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:28,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that the other day.

636
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:31,587
[SPEAKER_06]: See, you're bitter about that.

637
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:32,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got that to be bitter about.

638
00:42:33,308 --> 00:42:34,268
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

639
00:42:34,308 --> 00:42:35,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not bitter about it.

640
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:38,609
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I couldn't see for 30 minutes.

641
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:39,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

642
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,210
[SPEAKER_01]: That was scary.

643
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:44,301
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't see my Xbox 360 not working.

644
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:45,503
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

645
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:47,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone had to email me about that at work.

646
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:57,394
[SPEAKER_06]: GameDaily.com posted this list called 10 Obscure Super Nintendo Games That We Want to Play on the Revolution.

647
00:42:57,934 --> 00:43:07,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know how newsworthy this is, but it may dig, and I thought it's a good thing to discuss on the show, a nice little topic to kind of bounce around.

648
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:11,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why people always want to make lists, but here it is, another list.

649
00:43:11,377 --> 00:43:14,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're going to be doing a list actually later tonight, so maybe I shouldn't be bashing it too much.

650
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:20,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's their list of games they want to see playable on the Revolution in a little, like, emulation thing.

651
00:43:20,022 --> 00:43:21,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, of course, you know the Revolution.

652
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:22,723
[SPEAKER_06]: You're supposed to be able to play old games on it.

653
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:24,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Paint.

654
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:26,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Actraiser.

655
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:29,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Actraiser was a weird game to put on here.

656
00:43:29,347 --> 00:43:32,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I thought, isn't Revolution only supposed to do the first party games?

657
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:35,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do we know about... I guess we really don't know if third party.

658
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it would be whichever ones sign on.

659
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:37,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

660
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:39,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see.

661
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:40,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's a possibility.

662
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:40,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Earthbound.

663
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:41,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Good choice.

664
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:42,974
[SPEAKER_06]: UN Squadron.

665
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:51,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on down the list, Legend of the Mystical Ninja, also known as Goemon, Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, Urban Strike.

666
00:43:51,914 --> 00:43:54,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Now even though that's three separate games, they're looping that into one.

667
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Now see, I don't know, because that's more of a Genesis thing.

668
00:43:57,597 --> 00:44:00,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I attach those games to Genesis for me, but I don't know.

669
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:04,200
[SPEAKER_06]: EVO, Search for Eden, Uniracers.

670
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why that's on that list, but whatever.

671
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:09,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I also thought it was weird that they said obscure Super Nintendo games.

672
00:44:09,737 --> 00:44:11,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, EarthBound wasn't that obscure.

673
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, they never really, you know, they sat on a

674
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:37,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually doing a sequel for a long, long time, and now it may not even come out here, but I don't know if it was obscure, but okay, whatever, whatever.

675
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:38,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll look past that.

676
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:41,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that's missing from this list, you think?

677
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:44,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Nintendo games that we ought to be able to play on the Revolution.

678
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly obscure.

679
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides the big ones.

680
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:48,101
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know Metroid, Zelda.

681
00:44:48,142 --> 00:44:48,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides the big ones.

682
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:50,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly obscure games, at least.

683
00:44:50,663 --> 00:44:51,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that you think is missing.

684
00:44:52,964 --> 00:44:53,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say one.

685
00:44:53,745 --> 00:44:55,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's an obscure game I used to love.

686
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:59,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I know for a fact this won't be playable on Revolution, though, because it was a Sony game.

687
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:03,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Equinox, the sequel to Solstice.

688
00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:04,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved that game.

689
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to see that, but that's obviously me living in a fantasy world.

690
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:09,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else want to add anything?

691
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:12,216
[SPEAKER_03]: What was Equinox?

692
00:45:13,217 --> 00:45:15,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever play Solstice on the regular?

693
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:18,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having trouble remembering because I remember that.

694
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a bit of a puzzle game.

695
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:23,886
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like 3D isometric type thing and you kind of walked around.

696
00:45:23,906 --> 00:45:24,707
[SPEAKER_01]: It had square movements.

697
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:25,192
[SPEAKER_06]: StarFox

698
00:45:46,198 --> 00:45:48,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, that's a good one, that's a good one.

699
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely a first party title a lot of folks want to see.

700
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:51,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, nothing?

701
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:56,226
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I didn't play that many Super Nintendo games, and it's really sad.

702
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Super Mario RPG.

703
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:02,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that'd be one that they would probably do.

704
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:09,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, other than that, you know, it really wasn't too much.

705
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:13,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a huge fan of Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is kind of like,

706
00:46:14,757 --> 00:46:16,719
[SPEAKER_08]: A cheap version of Sonic the Hedgehog.

707
00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:17,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

708
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:18,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that's obscure.

709
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,882
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of the first games I had, which is weird.

710
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaking Dracula X. But the Super Nintendo port was assy compared to the original.

711
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:35,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they could have, it would have been prohibitively expensive because you have this whole other scenario with Maria that they just didn't do.

712
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:39,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they could say, okay, now that we have revolution technology, here's Dracula X the way it should have been.

713
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:48,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, all of us who have these $300 copies of Dracula X for PC Engine are going to find their copy now worth $50.

714
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:53,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what the chat room has to say over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

715
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:53,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on chat.

716
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:56,074
[SPEAKER_06]: WonderDog Harold says, Zombies ate my neighbors.

717
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:57,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yes.

718
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:57,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, yes.

719
00:46:58,835 --> 00:47:02,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see a new version of that or put it on Xbox Lives Arcade.

720
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:02,697
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be great.

721
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:03,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Smash TV.

722
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:05,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Smash TV.

723
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:06,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire Bulma said Smash TV.

724
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:07,679
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

725
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:09,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini says Yoshi's Island.

726
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

727
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

728
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Yoshi's Cookie.

729
00:47:13,168 --> 00:47:15,328
[SPEAKER_06]: PK Akira 88, Yoshi Safari.

730
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:16,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the Super Scope one?

731
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:18,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that the Super Scope one where you run around?

732
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:21,149
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the mole game.

733
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:24,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you shot moles with the Super Scope.

734
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:25,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember that.

735
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,691
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just the generic cartridge that came with it, but there was like the games like Blasterous and something else.

736
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,351
[SPEAKER_01]: The Super Scope 6 game.

737
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:30,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

738
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:31,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I was pretty ghetto.

739
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the Sega Menacer.

740
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:34,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, cool.

741
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:35,612
[SPEAKER_01]: The Menacer was cool because you could take it apart.

742
00:47:36,512 --> 00:47:38,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sucked though.

743
00:47:38,213 --> 00:47:38,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have a Menacer.

744
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:39,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

745
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:40,153
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

746
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,456
[SPEAKER_03]: ToeJam & Earl Secret of Mana!

747
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:09,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go over and open up the mailbag because DarkSakura, she likes to open up your email and you guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaundredo.com and she reads them.

748
00:48:09,913 --> 00:48:12,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have a good laugh.

749
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:15,415
[SPEAKER_06]: She laughs at the hate mail and then reads some of the good ones on air.

750
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get hate mail.

751
00:48:18,297 --> 00:48:19,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I get love mail.

752
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:22,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we start mailbag, see now they're going to send you hate mail because you said you don't get hate mail.

753
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:23,299
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yes I do.

754
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:26,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we start Mailbag tonight, if I may, on a personal note.

755
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:27,124
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

756
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:30,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I got some emails directly to my personal email address this week.

757
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:39,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, last week on the show, I had a coming out of sorts because I never mentioned, you know, the fact that I was gay until we talked about the World of Warcraft thing.

758
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:43,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Although folks who've been listening to the live show knew it for a long time.

759
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:44,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually thought it was in my bio.

760
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize that folks who've been listening to the podcast for so long didn't know it.

761
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:49,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So it kind of was a coming out of sorts.

762
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:52,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to say I got some...

763
00:48:52,925 --> 00:49:03,773
[SPEAKER_06]: really amazing emails of support from people you know from all across it didn't matter if they were straight, gay, you know whatever I just got some amazing emails that really just

764
00:49:05,003 --> 00:49:06,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Make Me Remember Why I Do This

765
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:39,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, to me, to my email, which is X-T-O-F-E-R at orangelonsradio.com I will gladly read them and possibly comment on them.

766
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:41,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, except there's a difference.

767
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:42,296
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I came out as gay.

768
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,457
[SPEAKER_06]: You're coming out as an asshole.

769
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:45,279
[SPEAKER_06]: A bleached one.

770
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just messing with you.

771
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,621
[SPEAKER_00]: A bleached one.

772
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:48,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad joke.

773
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:49,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad old joke.

774
00:49:49,783 --> 00:49:50,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I like men, too.

775
00:49:50,784 --> 00:49:51,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was the mailbag?

776
00:49:51,344 --> 00:49:52,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, there's the mailbag.

777
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:55,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to the mailbag, shall we, DarkSakura?

778
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:56,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

779
00:49:57,523 --> 00:49:57,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi!

780
00:49:58,223 --> 00:49:58,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

781
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:03,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually went over my limit because I got a bunch of emails this week again.

782
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,209
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one I'm going to bring up is sent by Malice.

783
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:10,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to read this as a question actually put forth to us.

784
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:13,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you people knew about this.

785
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish to know more about it before I purchase it.

786
00:50:16,209 --> 00:50:24,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Skipping forward, it seems to be a special edition of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with a 30 minute prologue CG or animation.

787
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:27,341
[SPEAKER_01]: It's apparently a budget title as it is $20.

788
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:30,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you guys think about it before I shell out the cash.

789
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:35,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really think anything of Grand Theft Auto, so...

790
00:50:37,443 --> 00:50:40,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I defer to Loki because I don't really play these games either.

791
00:50:40,445 --> 00:50:48,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the platinum hit or greatest hits or whatever version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because they've sold millions and millions of copies.

792
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,731
[SPEAKER_08]: So it came out at a new low price of $19.95.

793
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all it really is.

794
00:50:54,193 --> 00:51:04,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, every now and then, the new trend now, especially with Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, they release little added features as well on top of dropping the price of the game.

795
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:06,220
[SPEAKER_08]: A little extra something.

796
00:51:07,096 --> 00:51:15,820
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I'm going to be honest, even though I understand why the game gets a lot of critical praise and all that stuff, it's kind of one of those games that's fun for me for a couple days and then I'm kind of tired of it.

797
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,803
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a game that you can literally play up, pick up, play the missions, or just fuck around.

798
00:51:23,244 --> 00:51:24,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really cool.

799
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:25,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really fun.

800
00:51:25,645 --> 00:51:28,026
[SPEAKER_08]: San Andreas is definitely the best one in the series so far.

801
00:51:28,146 --> 00:51:32,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, $20 for that game, you can play it for hours and hours and not get bored of it.

802
00:51:33,648 --> 00:51:34,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I highly recommend it.

803
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:36,650
[SPEAKER_08]: The storyline is really good in it too.

804
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus you get a main character named Jizzy.

805
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:40,411
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's CJ.

806
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:42,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought it was Jizzy.

807
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:43,653
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not Jizzy.

808
00:51:43,673 --> 00:51:44,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm calling him Jizzy.

809
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:46,514
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only in the hot coffee mod.

810
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:48,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, next email.

811
00:51:49,255 --> 00:51:51,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this one comes from MisaSky.

812
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:58,659
[SPEAKER_01]: It's titled Fantasy Star Universe vs. Final Fantasy XI as in EKS, EYE.

813
00:51:58,719 --> 00:51:59,500
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was cute.

814
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:00,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

815
00:52:01,414 --> 00:52:06,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, I love the new format you guys are giving the show, and I kind of want you to debate on something if you can.

816
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,366
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple months ago, I got Final Fantasy XI for my PC.

817
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:16,257
[SPEAKER_01]: My father would allow me to play as long as I got good grades, so there's my copy of Final Fantasy XI sitting in the corner, crying and gathering dust.

818
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:20,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I also recently found out about the new Corsair job, and I think it looks pretty.

819
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:24,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I would buy and play the game just because of the sexy outfits for the Corsair job.

820
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:29,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I have recently gotten back with my PSO community, and they are getting ready for Phantasy Star Universe.

821
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:33,504
[SPEAKER_01]: This game, too, is also very sexy, mainly because of all the new weapons and new character creator.

822
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to stick with one MMO, but they seemed so good.

823
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:40,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I have $70 to waste importing PSU from my...

824
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:45,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Station of Playing 2 is looking very good right now.

825
00:52:45,503 --> 00:52:45,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think?

826
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:51,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's tough because I haven't really played Phantasy Star Universe.

827
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:58,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a little bit at the E3 demo kiosk, but I can only really go off my experience with Phantasy Star Online and how it might be a little bit different.

828
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

829
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the biggest difference between the two games.

830
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:05,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically fundamentally how the attack systems work.

831
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:11,310
[SPEAKER_06]: In Phantasy Star, you hit a button to literally swing your sword, so it's more of an action-based MMO.

832
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:20,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas in Final Fantasy XI, you're auto-swinging your sword and you're doing other things with that, such as your weapon skills or your magic or whatever.

833
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:24,262
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a quote-unquote traditional-style RPG game.

834
00:53:24,742 --> 00:53:25,563
[SPEAKER_06]: in MMO form.

835
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:26,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little hard to explain.

836
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:30,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like other Final Fantasies at all because the battle system is so much different.

837
00:53:30,726 --> 00:53:32,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Although if you played the 12 demo, it's kind of similar to the 12 demo.

838
00:53:34,884 --> 00:53:35,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

839
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:58,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say go play World of Warcraft.

840
00:53:58,898 --> 00:53:58,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.

841
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:28,405
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, if you want a cool, actual good game, I mean, play World of Warcraft.

842
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:34,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay away from Final Fantasy XI because it'll just make you sad.

843
00:54:35,468 --> 00:54:37,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least don't be a white mage.

844
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:40,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Was your experience... Because you become the bitch of the party.

845
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but same thing with a priest in WoW.

846
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:46,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a bad experience with Final Fantasy XI, Extover?

847
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:48,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it just seemed like every single time...

848
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just give the game a little bit of credit, because I did actually enjoy playing it a lot.

849
00:54:55,783 --> 00:55:01,947
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, it just got really tiring on having to try and find a party all the freaking time.

850
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:06,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, when I was in a party, it was just like drama.

851
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,311
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just so much drama.

852
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:13,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather deal with drama in a guild on World of Warcraft where I can just leave it and say, you know...

853
00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:15,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw you guys, I'm going home.

854
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:16,414
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whatever.

855
00:55:16,474 --> 00:55:21,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, on Final Fantasy XI, I mean, you're, like, blackbooked.

856
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:30,597
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, like, really bad in a party without intending to be, people really remember that, and they don't want you in your party anymore.

857
00:55:31,837 --> 00:55:32,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, next email.

858
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,838
[SPEAKER_01]: People kept wanting me in their stupid party.

859
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:37,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hated them, and I let the tank die on purpose.

860
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:42,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, okay, I told you about the party I was in with the tank who was a jerk.

861
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I let him die.

862
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:44,854
[SPEAKER_01]: There's jerks in every game.

863
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:45,914
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the party thanked me.

864
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:47,235
[SPEAKER_06]: There's jerks in every game.

865
00:55:48,696 --> 00:55:53,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up comes from... Okay, for a moment I could not hear myself on the microphone.

866
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,602
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from Steve, who... Hi, Steve!

867
00:55:57,622 --> 00:56:01,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to start doing that with all the people that email us.

868
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:01,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say hi to them.

869
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:02,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hi, Steve!

870
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:08,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve is... Actually, I'm going to say right now a very kind soul.

871
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:08,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

872
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,915
[SPEAKER_01]: For other reasons we might discuss later.

873
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:19,799
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was actually sending me questions looking for information on Judy Crystal about other songs that she did.

874
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:28,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had sort of been into Judy Crystal for a little bit, but not like majorly, majorly.

875
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:33,606
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically Judy Crystal did God of Romance in DDR.

876
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:37,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a little clip of God of Romance, just in case you're not unfamiliar with Judy Crystal.

877
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:37,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

878
00:56:41,141 --> 00:57:10,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer is a place where we have to be Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy Okay Which is actually a remake of Romance of Nokami-sama Uh-huh Which I've played in pre-shows before Maybe I'll put it in next week's pre-show But at any rate, she also did Tokyo Already, Baby Love Me, You Can't Hurry Love And Nori, Nori, Nori

879
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:11,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.

880
00:57:29,061 --> 00:57:30,482
[SPEAKER_01]: JB, way back when.

881
00:57:30,522 --> 00:57:31,823
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a big Judy Crystal fan.

882
00:57:32,143 --> 00:57:32,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

883
00:57:33,464 --> 00:57:35,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to hunt him down if he still keeps up with us.

884
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:37,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know where to find him.

885
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:38,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask me again offline.

886
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:38,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you where to find him.

887
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:40,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

888
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:48,676
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, she's been on like a bajillion Parapara compilations, including one of the big ones by the Parapara All-Stars.

889
00:57:49,017 --> 00:57:49,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

890
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,542
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

891
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:30,369
[SPEAKER_01]: um basically and I had actually intended on going back and making a public apology to the one who I said I didn't think is being very professional over the whole Mac thing being a graphic artist given that Mac is the standard for graphic artists but um there are people who are very prone toward PC maybe had a bad experience with a Mac

892
00:58:32,372 --> 00:58:34,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to even look at Loki right now.

893
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:35,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Just call it truce.

894
00:58:36,015 --> 00:58:38,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's keep it moving.

895
00:58:38,196 --> 00:58:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the sake of the show, I am no longer joining the debate.

896
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:54,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to buy my... I'm actually getting a Mac for my birthday because I intend on being more serious with my art and I'd see that as a natural progression for myself as an artist.

897
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:55,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

898
00:58:56,932 --> 00:59:18,529
[SPEAKER_01]: and I say that coffin not only needs to have the last nail shoved into it whatever you're thinking Loki, swallow it and it needs to be set on fire like your Xbox Loki's laughing in the corner there swallow it I'm just saying I don't bring it up every week everyone else brings it up they try to drag me back into this I don't really care you know what

899
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:21,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if it seemed offensive.

900
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:33,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't aim to offend, but that was how I felt that it just sort of blindsided me because every professional graphic artist I know, and I know a lot of them.

901
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in California.

902
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Every last one of them uses a Mac.

903
00:59:37,552 --> 00:59:40,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just really sort of blindsided by that one.

904
00:59:40,935 --> 00:59:41,956
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was where I came from.

905
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:50,503
[SPEAKER_06]: In defense, a little bit, tiny bit, I don't want to go too far, but I did used to work for a publishing company, and we used both.

906
00:59:51,184 --> 00:59:51,604
[SPEAKER_06]: We used both.

907
00:59:52,785 --> 00:59:56,389
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things PC does better, some things Mac does better, just depends on how you use it.

908
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:59,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I use both, and I don't have a preference, actually.

909
00:59:59,912 --> 01:00:00,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I like both.

910
01:00:00,653 --> 01:00:02,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually digging the Mac OS Tiger.

911
01:00:02,575 --> 01:00:02,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

912
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,100
[SPEAKER_03]: You're bi-computeral?

913
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:07,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

914
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:08,362
[SPEAKER_03]: You're totally bi?

915
01:00:08,382 --> 01:00:09,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I am freaking bi.

916
01:00:09,864 --> 01:00:10,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tri-computeral.

917
01:00:11,546 --> 01:00:13,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have some Linux love now.

918
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:14,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

919
01:00:14,851 --> 01:00:15,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!

920
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:16,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

921
01:00:17,134 --> 01:00:17,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, anyway, anyway.

922
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:20,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Simultaneous loving, baby.

923
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:21,841
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of...

924
01:00:25,244 --> 01:00:31,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to paraphrase because some of it seems a little bit more personal than I'm comfortable going into.

925
01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:36,150
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our listeners, James, sent in an email.

926
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:36,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, James!

927
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:38,071
Rob!

928
01:00:39,232 --> 01:00:39,752
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Rob?

929
01:00:39,892 --> 01:00:41,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say this fair to you.

930
01:00:43,734 --> 01:00:47,096
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going from Mr. Stress, I hate the Xbox, to hi!

931
01:00:47,696 --> 01:00:50,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to turn that angst into something more useful in this world.

932
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:52,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not useful.

933
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back to angst.

934
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:53,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Zip it!

935
01:00:54,582 --> 01:00:55,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Angst is hot.

936
01:00:56,884 --> 01:00:58,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for when it's hot.

937
01:00:58,146 --> 01:00:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Read your email!

938
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:01,048
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so hot.

939
01:01:02,009 --> 01:01:16,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it was saying that things were fairly rough, and then DDR was out, the DDR Extreme, and I was absolutely addicted to it.

940
01:01:18,605 --> 01:01:18,806
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

941
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:29,618
[SPEAKER_01]: was talking about how it was sort of alienating to you, because when, you know, you know how a lot of us went through that, being, when we played DDR, there was just a, oh, you played that game, you know?

942
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:37,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, like the taunting of the other people at the arcades, you know, and like, oh, the, you know, the fags playing DDR, you know, just get over it.

943
01:01:37,365 --> 01:01:45,432
[SPEAKER_01]: He also said, though, that he was playing in a small crowd gathered around, we all, we know how the crowd goes, and then he met his best friend that way, and has met many more friends through the game.

944
01:01:46,012 --> 01:01:47,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking a lot of us were like that, you know?

945
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:51,452
[SPEAKER_06]: We all met through DDR.

946
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:56,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I met my very best friend in the universe through DDR.

947
01:01:57,553 --> 01:02:02,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It's opened all kinds of doors, not just for me personally, for all of us.

948
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:05,675
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off as a DDR show.

949
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:07,356
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our thing.

950
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:18,767
[SPEAKER_01]: We even came up with the concept and the name on the BART going to San Francisco to play DDR at the Metreon.

951
01:02:20,248 --> 01:02:21,349
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's not nerdy enough.

952
01:02:24,651 --> 01:02:26,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for paraphrasing it.

953
01:02:27,193 --> 01:02:36,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to give a written response to it until I actually had a chance to read it on the air, but I have to say that good for you.

954
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:38,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I also got an email from Danny

955
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:07,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Dani!

956
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:11,739
[SPEAKER_01]: She writes in and says thank you for the Rick Sanchez interview.

957
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:12,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.

958
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Did GameTamp plant that email?

959
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:43,361
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

960
01:03:43,622 --> 01:03:44,442
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

961
01:03:44,682 --> 01:03:48,024
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be very happy to hear that, and I think that's what they're trying to do, so it's great.

962
01:03:48,064 --> 01:03:53,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do think there are a few trusted emulation sites that I know of.

963
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:56,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into them on the air right now.

964
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:04,755
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really do, if you're new into the emulation scene, you really do have to wade through piles of crap before you get to the good stuff, you know?

965
01:04:05,484 --> 01:04:08,747
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually think that that is a fabulous idea.

966
01:04:09,007 --> 01:04:15,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, I think that a lot of the older games that we're seeing through GameTap had a lot more value to them.

967
01:04:15,713 --> 01:04:20,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these were games where they could not focus on graphics.

968
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,820
[SPEAKER_01]: These were games that had solid gameplay.

969
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,682
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the ones that are up on there.

970
01:04:25,702 --> 01:04:26,663
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the classics.

971
01:04:27,456 --> 01:04:31,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear, I watch Rob play it all the time, and I'm very impressed.

972
01:04:31,898 --> 01:04:34,239
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had the money, I would subscribe to it.

973
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:37,480
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, it's very well done.

974
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:41,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually thinking of doing it.

975
01:04:41,522 --> 01:04:45,143
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't that I was in school right now, I would totally do it.

976
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:47,624
[SPEAKER_01]: But after the show, I get to go home and paint some more.

977
01:04:49,445 --> 01:04:49,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Two more.

978
01:04:51,886 --> 01:04:52,987
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is from Sakurina.

979
01:04:53,107 --> 01:04:53,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Sakurina.

980
01:04:54,327 --> 01:04:55,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We like Sakurina.

981
01:04:55,348 --> 01:04:56,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Sakurina.

982
01:04:57,767 --> 01:05:02,528
[SPEAKER_01]: This has to do with the gate removal thing.

983
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:04,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, in Animal Crossing, yes.

984
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:04,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

985
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:10,410
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've read on various gaming blogs, the removal of gates is caused by a glitch having something to do with pitfall seeds.

986
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read this a couple of places too.

987
01:05:12,431 --> 01:05:16,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, anyone who falls into a pitfall somewhere in town could trigger this glitch to remove the gate.

988
01:05:17,972 --> 01:05:21,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that that would be cleared up in case one of the people in our friend code thread happened to...

989
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,307
[SPEAKER_01]: have it happen to them.

990
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:37,441
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, we do have an open forum on our website in our forum section for our Animal Crossing players to share friend codes and when you'll have your gate open and blah, blah, blah.

991
01:05:38,662 --> 01:05:41,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, last one from Mike.

992
01:05:41,966 --> 01:05:42,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Mike.

993
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:44,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is awesome.

994
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:45,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

995
01:05:47,154 --> 01:05:52,535
[SPEAKER_01]: He said EGM did a top 200 games on their list for their 200th issue.

996
01:05:53,935 --> 01:06:00,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually needed to grab that issue of EGM because I sort of got it out of EGM, but every so often I pick them up just to see what's going on.

997
01:06:02,237 --> 01:06:07,078
[SPEAKER_01]: But now these were their top 10 games.

998
01:06:07,118 --> 01:06:08,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 10 was Pong.

999
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:09,998
[SPEAKER_01]: 9 was Grand Theft Auto 3.

1000
01:06:10,938 --> 01:06:12,579
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

1001
01:06:12,819 --> 01:06:13,539
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it should be number 1.

1002
01:06:14,814 --> 01:06:24,616
[SPEAKER_01]: 7 was Space Invaders, 6 was Super Mario 64, 5 Legend of Zelda, 4 Tetris, 3 Street Fighter 2, 2 Pac-Man, 1 Super Mario Bros.

1003
01:06:25,296 --> 01:06:25,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.

1004
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually read the magazine the other day.

1005
01:06:27,957 --> 01:06:29,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty good list.

1006
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:34,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty happy with that list as compared to most of these top games of all time lists.

1007
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:38,639
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one, I'm not big on the Mario 64 as many people are.

1008
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:39,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

1009
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:42,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Mario 64, but I also have very fond memories of it.

1010
01:06:45,071 --> 01:06:47,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of other people are really into it, it's just not my thing.

1011
01:06:47,372 --> 01:06:57,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Honorable Mentions, 12 Metal Gear Solid, 17 Halo, 46 Resident Evil 4, 74 Chrono Trigger, that should be much further up there, 92 Super Smash Bros.

1012
01:06:57,714 --> 01:07:08,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Melee, 196 Guitar Hero, which has been played non-stop in my house all day, 178 DDR, 172 Katamari Damashii, no version of Puyo Puyo,

1013
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,371
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.

1014
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:12,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a crying shame.

1015
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:13,614
[SPEAKER_06]: No Final Fantasy mentions.

1016
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure it's in the list.

1017
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be somewhere, but I'm kind of surprised Final Fantasy 7 didn't crack the top 10 a little bit.

1018
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:21,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But no Peel Peel.

1019
01:07:21,862 --> 01:07:26,506
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have been paying attention to know that I am like this uber Peel Peel fan.

1020
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:31,711
[SPEAKER_01]: We had it as Peel Pop, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Kirby's Avalanche.

1021
01:07:33,473 --> 01:07:34,234
[SPEAKER_01]: That breaks my heart.

1022
01:07:35,354 --> 01:07:36,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm closing the mailbag.

1023
01:07:36,555 --> 01:07:36,895
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1024
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:37,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulling the strings.

1025
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:41,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us some email.

1026
01:07:42,077 --> 01:07:44,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And we might read your email on the air if we feel like it.

1027
01:07:46,138 --> 01:07:50,740
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that also seems like it's going to happen whenever somebody feels like it is Duke Nukem Forever.

1028
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:53,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what the heck is going on with Duke Nukem Forever?

1029
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:57,622
[SPEAKER_08]: If you believe it or not, it's actually still being worked on.

1030
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:00,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, they had an interview.

1031
01:08:00,683 --> 01:08:01,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it was on 1UP.

1032
01:08:04,056 --> 01:08:04,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

1033
01:08:04,596 --> 01:08:09,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, on one up, talking to co-founder of 3D Realms.

1034
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:14,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, in the interview, they brought up Duke Nukem Forever.

1035
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:18,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, it says that a lot of it's been finished.

1036
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,566
[SPEAKER_08]: All the guns are finished, and most of the creatures are finished.

1037
01:08:21,606 --> 01:08:23,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, they're putting together the pieces.

1038
01:08:23,427 --> 01:08:31,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So they said it's possible, it's possible, cross your fingers, you might see Duke Nukem Forever coming out in 2006.

1039
01:08:33,905 --> 01:08:34,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1040
01:08:36,357 --> 01:08:39,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at chatroom feedback to the top 200 list right now.

1041
01:08:39,499 --> 01:08:41,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Over to OrnisonTrader.com, click on chat.

1042
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:45,903
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 says, Metroid Prime, Super Metroid.

1043
01:08:46,183 --> 01:08:49,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Super Metroid's the game I would have had in the top 10 instead of Mario 64.

1044
01:08:49,265 --> 01:08:51,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Metroid Prime was in the top 200, though.

1045
01:08:51,466 --> 01:08:53,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Metroid needs to be one of those emulated games.

1046
01:08:53,428 --> 01:08:55,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Metroid needs to be... Yeah, I love Super Metroid.

1047
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:56,970
[SPEAKER_06]: It recognizes one of the best video games of all time.

1048
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

1049
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:58,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an incredible game.

1050
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:00,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was in the list, though, too.

1051
01:09:00,812 --> 01:09:04,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have very positive memories of Super Metroid because...

1052
01:09:04,554 --> 01:09:06,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I would lay on the couch and watch Dan play all the way through it.

1053
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:09,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was together time over video games.

1054
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:10,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

1055
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that game.

1056
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

1057
01:09:13,061 --> 01:09:15,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Any type of Metroid game is... Rob.

1058
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:15,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1059
01:09:16,024 --> 01:09:16,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1060
01:09:16,684 --> 01:09:16,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1061
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:17,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1062
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:18,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1063
01:09:18,606 --> 01:09:18,786
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1064
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:19,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1065
01:09:19,427 --> 01:09:19,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1066
01:09:19,647 --> 01:09:19,807
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1067
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:20,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1068
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:23,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Jamie!

1069
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:26,172
[SPEAKER_01]: RedRuth.GreenBean.org TildaBen.4cr

1070
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:51,511
[SPEAKER_06]: slash SMB underscore super underscore synth dot SWF.

1071
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:55,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Super Mario Brothers Audio Sound Super Synthesizer.

1072
01:09:55,252 --> 01:10:05,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially what they've done on this, and I'm playing with it right now, is they've taken all these sounds from Mario Brothers and basically stripped them all out so that you can make your own remixes.

1073
01:10:05,753 --> 01:10:08,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to remix something right here on the air right now.

1074
01:10:08,134 --> 01:10:08,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.

1075
01:10:11,214 --> 01:10:13,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's all do the Mario.

1076
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, I fucked up.

1077
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:34,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's all do the Mario, come on it's time to go to Mario I've got a lot of coins, woo, Mario Da da da, swing your hands from side to side See, and I can do this in my room late at night when no one's watching That's the only place you should be doing that Yeah

1078
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:37,256
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd rather not hear about anything else.

1079
01:10:37,997 --> 01:10:38,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1080
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:40,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That subject's over.

1081
01:10:40,519 --> 01:10:42,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I won't be doing any more stories this hour.

1082
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:46,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go over to Loki, who has something of a bit more serious nature.

1083
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:48,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1084
01:10:48,906 --> 01:10:53,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another game that's getting more flack from people.

1085
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:54,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And this one is...

1086
01:10:58,223 --> 01:11:03,484
[SPEAKER_08]: The Association for American Indian Development Calls for the Gun Boycott

1087
01:11:17,236 --> 01:11:29,969
[SPEAKER_08]: What's funny though is they failed to mention that actually in the game the Native Americans are portrayed very positively and also it's very accurate to the time period

1088
01:11:31,169 --> 01:11:36,492
[SPEAKER_08]: The Slaughtering of Renegade Apaches, The Atrocity of the Indian Scalping, and The Misinformation of Indian Traditions of Killing Sacred White Animals

1089
01:11:46,805 --> 01:11:55,172
[SPEAKER_08]: The petition requests that Activision remove all derogatory, harmful, and inaccurate depictions of American Indians from Gun and reissue the game.

1090
01:11:55,912 --> 01:12:01,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Not going to happen because the game is like $29 right now, and if they could sell it cheaper, they probably would.

1091
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:06,401
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't a very good game, just so you know.

1092
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:14,667
[SPEAKER_06]: On a completely different note, when you work for a game company, you have to sign what's called an NDA, a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

1093
01:12:15,322 --> 01:12:17,963
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, tell us about the dark side of NDAs.

1094
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:20,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they drug out in the street and shot?

1095
01:12:20,164 --> 01:12:21,665
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens when people violate those NDAs?

1096
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:22,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually just fired.

1097
01:12:25,067 --> 01:12:32,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a former employee of Sony Online Entertainment that was...

1098
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:39,296
[SPEAKER_01]: He spoke out about criticizing the PlayStation 3 and was fired.

1099
01:12:40,797 --> 01:12:42,797
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an artist, Josh Robinson.

1100
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:49,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give a quote here, all I really did was write a few paragraphs that gave my opinion on publicly released information.

1101
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't reveal any tech info.

1102
01:12:51,221 --> 01:12:53,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't reveal different shipping plans.

1103
01:12:54,963 --> 01:12:59,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still in awe of the whole uproar over what amounts to no information.

1104
01:13:00,865 --> 01:13:04,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, he posted in his blog that says, our game just keeps getting moved back and back and back.

1105
01:13:05,128 --> 01:13:05,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And where is the box?

1106
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:06,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the final system?

1107
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:07,770
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it coming out?

1108
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:08,410
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows.

1109
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:11,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meantime, people in the industry are starting to get just a little salty.

1110
01:13:12,853 --> 01:13:18,856
[SPEAKER_01]: You could always tell where the PS3 dev box was because it's the room that had the F-bomb coming out of it half the day.

1111
01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:24,400
[SPEAKER_01]: But he basically got sacked for it.

1112
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:53,953
[SPEAKER_01]: another quote here I talked with the people on the technical side of the Xbox 360 the consistent comment I am hearing from people on my end is the Xbox 360 is better oh snap they are saying that it is capable of just doing more hmm he also talked to at least two Sony employees who read the blog entry before it was posted and showed it to a producer and he said again another quote we were all in agreement that I was not breaking NDA with what I was saying

1113
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:58,113
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just upset that he was bad-mouthing him.

1114
01:13:58,193 --> 01:13:59,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's more one of those, too.

1115
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:05,176
[SPEAKER_06]: He tried to find something to sack him with since he opened his mouth and was critical.

1116
01:14:05,216 --> 01:14:05,816
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare he?

1117
01:14:06,577 --> 01:14:10,018
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare he speak the minds of everybody about this subject?

1118
01:14:10,138 --> 01:14:16,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And might I be the first to say the Xbox 360 can be more powerful than the PlayStation 3 all at once, but it's going to have to work first.

1119
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:17,781
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit more.

1120
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:18,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Just another quote.

1121
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:21,204
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something unfortunate to happen.

1122
01:14:21,244 --> 01:14:23,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I sincerely hope Sony isn't damaged by it.

1123
01:14:23,306 --> 01:14:27,830
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I cannot say enough nice things about the CEO and VP of the company.

1124
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:29,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I knowingly break NDA?

1125
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:31,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely did not.

1126
01:14:31,472 --> 01:14:33,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never do that and would never want to hurt Sony Online.

1127
01:14:34,355 --> 01:14:36,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I dance in the gray area by even opening my mouth?

1128
01:14:36,717 --> 01:14:38,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did and I was fired for it.

1129
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:44,463
[SPEAKER_01]: He did say, however, that he received four or five job offers immediately after leaving Sony and got a book deal as a result of the article.

1130
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:45,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Loser.

1131
01:14:46,321 --> 01:14:46,541
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1132
01:14:46,761 --> 01:14:47,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Loser.

1133
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:47,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1134
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:51,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first off, he's contradicting himself in his own quotes.

1135
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:58,086
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, we haven't seen a dev kit or anything like that, and he also says that the Xbox 360 is capable of more.

1136
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:01,048
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you know it's capable of more if you haven't received the final kit yet?

1137
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:05,010
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that, from what I read, that his group hasn't received a dev kit.

1138
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:08,932
[SPEAKER_01]: They did say there was a dev kit because of all the cursing coming from the room it was located in.

1139
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:10,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it's not a final system yet.

1140
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:12,139
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't mean anything.

1141
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,741
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't even have any working demos.

1142
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:17,163
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all just live renders and that's it.

1143
01:15:17,664 --> 01:15:19,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think it's a bunch of crap.

1144
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:23,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I think someone's bitter because someone bad-mouthed Sony and got fired for it.

1145
01:15:24,089 --> 01:15:25,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, book deal.

1146
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:25,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for you.

1147
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:27,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anyone's going to be buying that one.

1148
01:15:28,213 --> 01:15:38,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I do believe it is a state law that as long as you do not break your NDA, you are entitled to state whatever you want to as long as you are not using your company's facilities to do it.

1149
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:44,200
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you are posting this as yourself through your own private means.

1150
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:49,264
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually in several HR handbooks for different companies I've worked for within the state.

1151
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:56,229
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, if he's not a contracted worker, though, most companies have policies, we can terminate your employment for any reason we feel like.

1152
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,253
[SPEAKER_01]: But saying that they were doing it over breaking NDA, I think that that's a bit extreme.

1153
01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:07,238
[SPEAKER_01]: The last quote on here is, I guess the new rule for me is don't ever say anything about anything ever, ever.

1154
01:16:08,635 --> 01:16:09,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops, too late.

1155
01:16:09,576 --> 01:16:10,878
[SPEAKER_01]: When in doubt, keep your mouth shut.

1156
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:14,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Gee, you thought that wasn't a bad idea?

1157
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:15,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

1158
01:16:15,684 --> 01:16:24,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and in retrospect, I think that it was a really bad idea for him to speak out about it because, I mean, seriously, he works for a company that

1159
01:16:26,156 --> 01:16:29,539
[SPEAKER_03]: He had his posts pre-screened, but that's not going to do anything.

1160
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:35,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be almost as dumb as saying, I didn't think yelling that I had a bomb in an airport was a bad thing.

1161
01:16:37,004 --> 01:16:39,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked with the airport, and they said it was okay.

1162
01:16:40,506 --> 01:16:43,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just exercising my freedom of speech.

1163
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:45,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

1164
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:47,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of freedom of speech... Not really, though.

1165
01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:54,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra for one reason we had to have you on the show tonight is because you watch American Idol an awful lot, right?

1166
01:16:54,687 --> 01:16:55,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1167
01:16:55,128 --> 01:16:55,968
[SPEAKER_06]: You love American Idol.

1168
01:16:56,269 --> 01:16:57,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, but I still watch it.

1169
01:16:57,991 --> 01:16:58,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like crack.

1170
01:16:58,731 --> 01:16:59,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

1171
01:16:59,412 --> 01:17:05,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you catch the video game, somewhat video game or at least anime-related reference on American Idol this week?

1172
01:17:05,478 --> 01:17:05,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't.

1173
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:06,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Get this.

1174
01:17:06,519 --> 01:17:08,701
[SPEAKER_06]: There was this guy who auditioned on American Idol.

1175
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out what he did for his audition.

1176
01:17:10,403 --> 01:17:10,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1177
01:17:17,273 --> 01:17:18,874
[SPEAKER_05]: What is up with Austin, man?

1178
01:17:18,994 --> 01:17:20,255
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up with Austin, man?

1179
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bet you anything, though, that was creative editing.

1180
01:17:42,428 --> 01:17:46,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, maybe the producers got him to do that and then, like, spliced in the reaction shots.

1181
01:17:46,168 --> 01:17:47,429
[SPEAKER_03]: They do that all the time on that show.

1182
01:17:47,469 --> 01:17:48,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they do that stuff.

1183
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:49,169
[SPEAKER_06]: That show's so fake.

1184
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:50,469
So fake.

1185
01:17:50,669 --> 01:17:51,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1186
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:55,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody that shows up at those locations get picked.

1187
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:56,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons, right, Jamie?

1188
01:17:57,531 --> 01:17:57,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1189
01:17:58,351 --> 01:17:59,732
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them and set them on fire.

1190
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:00,552
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1191
01:18:00,812 --> 01:18:01,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they're crack.

1192
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:05,350
[SPEAKER_03]: In that case, watch American Idol.

1193
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And hate it every minute of it, but still watch it.

1194
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:09,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, take us to a new topic.

1195
01:18:09,672 --> 01:18:11,072
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on with Dragon Quest?

1196
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:13,413
[SPEAKER_08]: It's selling like hotcakes.

1197
01:18:13,433 --> 01:18:20,997
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dragon Quest series, actually, Dragon Quest VIII has crossed the 4 million units mark of worldwide shipments.

1198
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:23,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And this figure also includes 430,000 shipped to U.S.,

1199
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1200
01:18:48,173 --> 01:18:57,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest is a game that was really big in Japan, of course.

1201
01:18:57,263 --> 01:19:00,506
[SPEAKER_06]: A huge, huge series in Japan that's now catching on over here.

1202
01:19:00,867 --> 01:19:02,909
[SPEAKER_06]: But that takes us into the final story for this segment.

1203
01:19:03,269 --> 01:19:04,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it the Japanese games...

1204
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:05,952
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1205
01:19:27,216 --> 01:19:33,384
[SPEAKER_06]: In comparison, the US market has a much greater demand for Japanese titles.

1206
01:19:33,424 --> 01:19:41,796
[SPEAKER_06]: The article goes on to say, "...the cause of this problem appears to be the result of a combination of ignorance and apathy from American publishers towards the Japanese market."

1207
01:19:42,256 --> 01:19:52,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas Japanese publishers are willing to go the extra mile and carry out excellent localizations, their American counterparts seem reluctant to even bother getting their games translated to Japanese.

1208
01:19:52,703 --> 01:20:00,248
[SPEAKER_06]: As a result, the Japanese market is flooded with a multitude of bad American titles mixed in with the games that the Japanese public should be buying.

1209
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:04,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Thoughts?

1210
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:06,552
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been happening for years.

1211
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:08,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just been going on.

1212
01:20:09,454 --> 01:20:10,875
[SPEAKER_01]: They're relying on

1213
01:20:12,426 --> 01:20:23,754
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's from the fact from a corporate standpoint that they're saying business-wise there is this apathy and they are not taking any steps to change it, well, of course, it's going to stay the same.

1214
01:20:24,274 --> 01:20:27,777
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have no incentive because based on numbers,

1215
01:20:29,842 --> 01:20:35,167
[SPEAKER_01]: There hasn't been any past precedent to try to tailor the games to the Japanese market if they're not buying them anyway.

1216
01:20:35,808 --> 01:20:42,675
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that as typical with corporate America, they don't seem to realize the reason behind it.

1217
01:20:43,095 --> 01:20:44,116
[SPEAKER_01]: All they see are their figures.

1218
01:20:45,678 --> 01:20:46,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

1219
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, anything you want to add?

1220
01:20:50,682 --> 01:20:51,223
[SPEAKER_08]: We just have to...

1221
01:20:52,793 --> 01:20:56,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the movies and stuff they're coming out over here.

1222
01:20:56,857 --> 01:21:01,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's a perfect example of the difference between Japanese and American stuff.

1223
01:21:01,542 --> 01:21:03,905
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got really crappy video game movies coming out.

1224
01:21:03,965 --> 01:21:05,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and then look at Japanese market.

1225
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:08,350
[SPEAKER_08]: They have really kick-ass movies based on...

1226
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:10,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Anime series and games and whatnot.

1227
01:21:11,893 --> 01:21:13,835
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, American movies do very well in Japan.

1228
01:21:13,895 --> 01:21:15,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't Titanic their highest grossing movie too?

1229
01:21:15,897 --> 01:21:19,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the whole thing is though, let's look at some of these games that are coming out over here.

1230
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, like Forza Motorsports or something like that.

1231
01:21:21,963 --> 01:21:22,924
[SPEAKER_08]: A very American game.

1232
01:21:23,364 --> 01:21:27,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't do so well over in Japan because it, you know, or not Forza...

1233
01:21:28,137 --> 01:21:28,757
[SPEAKER_08]: what am I thinking of?

1234
01:21:29,397 --> 01:21:34,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Gotham 3 did really well over here, but not so well over there.

1235
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:38,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer kicked ass over there because Ridge Racer is just clearly a better game anyways.

1236
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:46,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the whole thing is I think people it's like, ooh, graphics, they're so amazing.

1237
01:21:46,344 --> 01:21:47,404
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics are so amazing.

1238
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:48,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the game sucks.

1239
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:49,905
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the problem.

1240
01:21:52,126 --> 01:21:57,208
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to focus more on gameplay over here in America, whereas right now we're focusing on

1241
01:21:57,711 --> 01:22:01,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Who can, you know, make the coolest graphics and, you know, sound and stuff like that.

1242
01:22:01,932 --> 01:22:04,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just completely lose sight on the game being good.

1243
01:22:05,873 --> 01:22:07,573
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some good games to come out of here, though.

1244
01:22:07,613 --> 01:22:08,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Some excellent stuff.

1245
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:09,073
[SPEAKER_08]: World of Warcraft?

1246
01:22:09,694 --> 01:22:10,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo?

1247
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:12,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but those games are doing, you know, pretty well.

1248
01:22:14,615 --> 01:22:15,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto?

1249
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:17,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that does well over there, does it?

1250
01:22:17,295 --> 01:22:17,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.

1251
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:18,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no.

1252
01:22:19,336 --> 01:22:19,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

1253
01:22:20,456 --> 01:22:20,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1254
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:23,296
[SPEAKER_06]: But they probably don't do much to localize it, really.

1255
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:25,577
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a tough title to localize, wouldn't it be?

1256
01:22:26,137 --> 01:22:26,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1257
01:22:27,085 --> 01:22:32,039
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm sure those of you guys in the chat room and who are listening to us on the podcast have plenty of feedback.

1258
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:32,922
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd love to hear it.

1259
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:34,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com or...

1260
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:37,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We should be opening up the Skype line in our next segment at some point.

1261
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:43,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of the next segment, I think it's time to take ourselves a little break and come back for the next segment.

1262
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:45,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So those of you guys listening live, we'll be back in a few minutes.

1263
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:52,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you guys listening on the podcast stream, we'll be back in a couple of days with more of Orange Lounge Radio episode number 173.
