14235	18797	Tonight, February 5th, 2006, new details emerge on the PlayStation 3.
19497	21838	Do American games always fail in Japan?
22118	23859	And a special ode to Kingdom Hearts.
27921	38125	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
38746	40066	It is February 5th, 2006.
42202	43423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
71724	75095	Say hello also to the one and only Loki.
77201	78445	Hi, how you doing?
80336	81356	Bad Rob!
81517	82557	Bad Rob!
83077	84278	Printer sucks!
84398	85498	Let me set up a little background.
85538	89100	I know we're a video game show, but let's face it, we've got to talk about our personal lives once in a while too.
89460	97343	Okay, I just bought a cheap printer today because for work I'm going down to LA on Monday and I have to fly out at 6 o'clock in the morning.
97603	98644	Well, I'm flying Southwest.
98684	105787	You know how Southwest has those boarding pass systems where depending on what time you print your boarding pass from the internet, you get an A, B, or C pass, right?
106347	108548	So I bought a printer so I could have myself an A-pass.
108568	109428	Well, I screwed up.
109868	111988	I thought you couldn't print your passes until after midnight.
112048	117350	And then, like, literally 30 minutes before the show, I realized, oh, crap, you can actually print them up to 24 hours in advance.
117650	122051	So I'm hooking up the printer in this furious frenzy, and now the damn thing won't even print.
122111	126152	And Loki's stuck over there because I have his computer frozen up with the boarding pass sitting there.
126212	132493	Yeah, because this wonderful printer that you bought didn't come with a black cartridge because that would have been too expensive.
132633	135354	And the printer's like, no, I don't want to print without a black cartridge.
135674	135794	Fuck!
135794	137936	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
164675	165516	Rob Ofer
195023	197885	Let's not talk about my personal crises for a minute.
197925	201307	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and how that's been going.
201487	204109	And we'll start off with a lovely DarkSakura with.
204149	205089	How was your gaming week?
205169	207050	I'm staring at the pretty precious.
208271	219558	I have in my hands Kingdom Hearts 2, which I've been playing a little bit of enough to realize that Ruxus sucks and that I'm glad that I don't have to use him the entire game.
220598	220679	Um...
223427	224367	It's very interesting.
224407	226288	It looks very, very pretty on my TV.
226828	232492	Except it's still on the PS2, so it's got jaggedies all to hell and back.
232952	234733	But the CG scenes look really pretty.
235693	236994	I loves me some Kingdom Hearts.
237274	238915	Yep.
239015	242617	I've also been playing lots of Animal Crossing, of course.
243618	249001	And Dan picked up Maverick Hunter X, the Mega Man X remake.
250089	251910	and it's pretty damn cool.
252550	255752	I mean, they completely redid the game for the PSP.
255912	256813	It's fabulous.
257393	263897	And also, if you beat the game, you get to get this little sort of OAV of how things led up to the situation.
264617	268359	Actually, the dubbing in it is not horrendous, which surprises the hell out of me.
268999	270880	It's very, very well done.
270920	271781	I'm very pleased.
271961	279365	And then you can play as the first guy that you fight, whose name eludes me at present, but he looks like Boba Fett.
280851	282552	And that's the Japanese copy that you have?
282712	283492	No, the American one.
283733	286974	Wow.
290336	290937	Maverick Hunter?
291397	292377	Oh, Maverick Hunter, never mind.
292457	298000	Yeah, I was wondering how I was playing it then purchased at a GameStop.
298781	299081	No!
299701	301482	No, no, I was talking about Kingdom Hearts.
302143	303743	Go back to the boarding pass, Loki, make it work.
305129	306350	What about Kingdom Hearts?
306390	307151	That's the Japanese one.
307171	308072	Yes, this is the Japanese one.
308172	309353	Okay, okay, I'm up to speed.
309373	310494	Yes, this is the Japanese one.
310934	313416	And how does that, um, how is that?
314597	315157	Is it beautiful?
315237	317159	I said it was pretty, but jaggedy.
317559	319821	Well, yeah, I mean, just, you can understand.
319941	320162	It's fun.
320182	321763	It actually plays more like Devil May Cry.
322343	322564	Really?
323805	333773	In fact, you want to play this game on as hard of a level as you can, or you will not level up high enough to beat Sephiroth by the time you get to him.
334943	335904	Puzzle Fighter Game Boy Micro
364870	391357	which when you're sitting in a waiting room having your eye checked out after it is swollen from an allergic reaction to a dog which I will be getting to later on in the show and your eye is in searing, throbbing pain it's very hard to look at a Game Boy micro screen I tortured myself for my art alright, that it?
391497	392937	my eye still looks like I got punched in it
393843	394823	I didn't even notice.
395363	396864	Oh, okay, a little bit.
396944	398224	It's not that bad.
398244	401825	At least it's not as bad as it was Friday because I looked like a Romero reject.
402705	407567	It was all like red bloodshot and then like that clear green that they only give zombies.
409047	409347	Okay.
409487	412108	So, yeah, I looked like a Romero reject.
412448	414409	Which means we have to cut off her head.
414749	419610	No, which is, nobody in this room is in any danger of me eating their brain.
419850	420991	Oh, that's refreshing.
421031	421291	Thank you.
421371	422131	Good, I'm glad.
422151	422611	Yeah.
423174	425456	I have a night elf, a level 38 night elf
447293	457386	on the Malfurion server, and I also have a level 29 druid on the Spinebreaker server that I've been playing with.
458788	462432	And they are mucho fun to play with, let me tell you.
462572	465156	How are the guilds that you've been joining up in the game?
465196	465877	Lots of drama.
467189	471832	I swear, I didn't know that all of this drama in the world of video games existed.
472033	474174	There's a bunch of drama queens in World of Warcraft.
474214	475635	Totally.
476075	484701	I got invited to a guild not too long ago on the Spinebreaker server, and the leader kept on giving me gifts or whatever.
484962	486443	He was enticing me with gifts.
487243	487363	And...
488706	493388	Suddenly, like, last night I'm playing, and I knew that there was a little bit of drama.
493408	497429	It didn't have anything to do with me or anything like that in the guild.
497890	500090	And two people were kicked off recently.
500591	503532	And then the leader himself left, the guy who invited me.
504012	508213	So I'm like, you know, I didn't even talk to anybody really on that guild anyway.
508454	511034	And the only guy I talked to was the guy who was giving me things.
511055	514576	So I was like, you know, screw this guild.
515296	515736	And I left.
516156	517457	And then Shane invited me to his.
518840	520761	or Miklatov, which you guys all know.
521141	522001	Yeah, he was here last week.
523481	525582	And stuff.
527222	527823	Exciting.
528223	528543	All right.
529323	533224	Loki, do you want to stop fighting with my new printer for a minute to tell us about your gaming week?
534744	536285	No, but I will.
536525	536805	Okay.
537865	538846	I didn't play too much.
538886	547408	I played Ridge Racer 6 a lot, as well as some more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories and a little bit of Animal Crossing.
548631	549591	and that's pretty much it.
549992	552973	Didn't play too much Call of Duty, really busy week, so.
554153	555453	Lots of Ridge Racer though, I love that game.
557874	560295	I'm having a little bit of an off night tonight, if you can't tell.
561395	562516	Haven't you had an off week?
562956	564376	Kinda, you know, there's more drama.
564396	566197	Let me talk about my gaming week, because there's even more drama.
566237	568077	Yeah, what games have you not been playing, Rob?
568458	570298	That would be anything on the Xbox 360.
571198	572119	Oh, wow, what happened?
572179	573339	Let me talk about what happened.
574079	575020	I got my Xbox 360 this week.
576260	576480	I did.
576540	578141	I finally found the Xbox 360.
578601	592389	I used the Best Buy locator thing that we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago, and I found out that a Best Buy had the Xbox 360 in stock, so I ran over there to a Best Buy, and they were out of premiums already at that point, but I managed to score myself a core system.
592449	592629	Yes!
593576	609321	So I bought a core system and the clerk was really nice and she gave me, it was really weird, like she had little slips of paper that had core written on it and the manager's signature and I had to take that up to the counter to get one of the core systems unlocked out of the gate and get my little core system to take home and play.
609901	611182	So, you know, cool.
611542	614463	And I picked up Cameo and Dead or Alive 4.
619025	619525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
638679	639760	It's a beautiful looking game.
639780	640721	It has lots of boobs.
640941	641241	It does.
641341	642141	It has lots of boobs.
642302	644403	And the environments are huge.
644483	646364	I love the stages in that game.
646564	647305	It's so great.
647625	649186	It's almost like free walking anywhere.
649466	650587	I like the Mexican wrestler.
651367	652188	Does he have boobs?
652608	652788	She.
652868	653469	No, she.
653909	654369	And yes.
654750	658692	I like the all-American girl with the huge knockers.
658892	659733	Yeah, Tina.
659773	660213	I like her.
660373	660833	She was my favorite.
660934	663715	And her dad, Hulk Hogan.
663855	665316	My best character, though, was the geisha.
666017	666817	Kokoro or whatever.
666877	667658	She's the best.
668325	669306	Her name means heart.
669466	669787	That's right.
670608	672149	And they all had mega boobs?
672410	673271	Yeah, they all had mega boobs.
673331	673711	It was awesome.
673731	673891	Wow.
674111	675573	So anyway, Dead or Alive 4, awesome.
675593	675893	So pretty.
678177	680939	Here's the problem.
681800	685382	Oh, and I download stuff on Xbox Arcade, too, like Joust, which was awesome.
685502	687864	I played Joust co-op online in battle.
687904	688324	That was fun.
688745	691647	And I played... What else did I download on there?
694089	696130	Oh, Geometry Wars, which was a lot of fun, too.
696370	697231	Just like what everybody says.
697271	697651	Yeah, so much fun.
698812	699373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
721564	724046	One of the little lights in the lower right-hand corner is flashing red.
724066	727088	I look at the TV, and it says, System Error.
727168	728949	Contact Microsoft Support.
729289	730450	Code E74.
731630	733231	And I was like, the fuck?
733512	734452	I just bought this thing.
734592	735533	What the hell is wrong with it?
736613	737714	So I said, okay, you know what?
737754	740015	Maybe it's just a bad time.
740055	741056	I'll just let it rest.
741096	741596	I'll try it again.
741636	742637	So I let it rest, tried again.
743217	743778	Still didn't work.
744378	746439	Unplugged all the cords, replugged them all back in.
746479	747000	Still didn't work.
747745	751708	I thought, okay, maybe my system's not getting enough ventilation, so I'll put it out in the open.
752108	756832	Okay, unplug all the cords, totally resituate my Xbox 360, plug it back in, still doesn't work.
757912	760274	Okay, maybe my Xbox 360's just being moody.
761015	763436	So I said, okay, fine, I'll try this again Friday when I get home from work.
763456	767159	So I tried again Friday when I get home from work, still nothing, still broken.
768560	774024	Not even a day and a half after owning my Xbox 360, it broke, and it has not worked since.
775919	782960	This is not one of those like reading it on the internet where, oh, look at some poor schmuck who their Xbox 360 broke right off the bat.
783260	783920	It was me.
784661	784861	Me.
784941	786441	My Xbox 360 broke.
787041	788421	I didn't do anything to it.
788461	791782	I didn't move it between the last time I played it because I went to a friend's house, came back, and powered it on.
791802	792842	The same place it was.
793122	795723	There was nothing possible I could have done to break this system.
795863	797143	Except for the Coke spilled on it.
797783	798623	No, not even that.
799143	800403	And also the lemonade.
800563	801304	No, nothing.
801984	803124	When I say lemonade, I mean...
804221	804581	Stop it.
805242	811668	Anyways, no, I was just going to say, you know, I know, I know.
811728	814290	And your reaction was priceless because you were laughing.
814530	821416	I was like, I thought you would be just like, you know, scary, you know, moody Rob, but you were actually like,
821949	822710	I can't believe this.
822770	824471	I think it was disbelief or something like that.
825873	836663	Because, like most of you out there, I'd read the stories on Joystick and Dig and Kotaku about, you know, oh, these poor bastards, their Xbox 360s broke right after they bought them, and, huh, happened to me!
838951	840152	And now you have to wait for a box.
863581	868464	I think the only thing you're really going to be able to do is send it back so we can take a look at it and work on it.
868484	869965	And the whole process takes a week.
870225	876129	Because obviously they have this thing down to a science right now, fixing these broken Xboxes, because apparently there's a ton of them out there.
876649	882573	So I'm now waiting for a box to come to me from Microsoft so I can send back my Xbox 360.
883233	887175	So, everybody out there... Do not play with the box.
887315	887456	No.
888616	890377	Take what happened to me as a lesson.
890918	891358	Honestly.
892782	907541	Think twice before you buy an Xbox 360 because obviously Microsoft has tons of issues right now and I'm sorry if I sound a little bitter but I am because I spent like $500 of my hard earned money on this system and the cords and the games and all that garbage for nothing.
908081	909183	The damn thing broke.
910185	911266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
931664	932544	I did nothing.
932985	933985	I'm an intelligent gamer.
934005	936366	I've been playing games since God knows when.
936586	939007	I know what to do and what not to do with the system.
939087	940587	I know do not put a new system.
940847	943228	Don't put it on top of other things so you can't ventilate.
943508	945169	I didn't do anything bad with the system.
945189	946749	The system was faulty from the start.
946990	953372	Although I'm wondering though if it's not just something simple wrong with it because usually it's the three lights flashing that's bad.
954172	955573	One light flashing, I'm not sure.
955933	956413	It's kind of like
957506	958827	Code Red, Code Yellow
983351	984692	Excuse me, but I think I have a reason to be.
984712	986393	I think you saved up your moodiness for tonight.
986453	986773	I did.
986793	991236	Well, now, and this whole printer malfunction thing just has me even more on edge with the whole thing.
991256	994178	That's what you get for rearranging my stuff.
994458	994859	Shut up.
995819	996900	I'm not in a good mood now.
997660	997801	Aw.
997961	998381	Angsty.
998961	999262	Hate.
999422	999822	Rage.
999902	1000202	Fire.
1000262	1000522	Burn.
1000542	1001283	Slash comfort.
1002924	1004605	Slash burninate Microsoft.
1004625	1005326	I'm so mad.
1008848	1010769	Maybe I'll be in a better mood once the damn thing's fixed.
1010789	1011950	I'm going out of town tomorrow.
1012762	1015023	So I said, that's what you get for playing with a box.
1019003	1020204	Let's move on to some gaming news.
1020224	1021344	Let's talk about something else.
1021544	1025205	I don't want to open with an Xbox 360 story tonight because I'm a little pissy.
1026805	1027945	So I want to open with something else.
1028226	1029966	So somebody give me a story on something else.
1030046	1033587	Loki, please tell me you have a story not related to Xbox 360.
1034847	1037428	Um, so anyways, with the 360, no.
1037468	1037548	Ah!
1042041	1046004	We do have a story talking about the Revolution and it's low, low prices.
1046784	1047585	So crazy.
1047805	1054429	Analysts say that the Revolution is supposed to be priced between $200 and $250, which is pretty cool.
1055190	1056371	Kind of what we already figured though.
1058752	1063055	Of course, Revolution will be launched likely by November.
1064356	1067158	Looking good, especially since all the other systems out there cost
1068323	1071825	Over, you know, $400, so that's not good.
1072305	1077048	Or, you know, $299 for a core system that doesn't even come with the frickin' cords that I need for my TV.
1077268	1088693	Yeah, $299, but you need a lot of stuff in order to... I love how only with the core system do you get the ever-rare composite cables minus the S-Video.
1088713	1090134	If you want S-Video, you gotta pay another $29.99.
1090174	1090434	Mm-hmm.
1090474	1091195	Not happy.
1093696	1094096	Not happy.
1097017	1102539	I'm sorry, if I sound anti-Microsoft tonight, usually I try to be very unbiased when it comes to this whole thing.
1102579	1109662	And I would say overall our listener base, because I'm watching the chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
1110002	1112583	And our listener base, usually they dog on Microsoft.
1112623	1114924	I don't see too many people dogging on Sony or Nintendo.
1115284	1117265	And usually I stick up for Microsoft.
1117305	1119506	And I say, you know what, let's be fair to all the systems.
1119826	1120826	And Microsoft does that.
1120886	1122227	Nope, tonight, free reign.
1122347	1123247	Bash Microsoft all you want.
1123287	1123647	I don't care.
1123687	1124748	I'm turning a blind eye to it.
1124768	1125648	I don't care.
1128027	1128587	Jamie, do you care?
1129648	1132649	Let him bash Microsoft tonight.
1132669	1132989	I don't care.
1133049	1133189	What?
1133529	1134029	Mine works.
1134429	1134849	I don't care.
1135349	1135830	Mine doesn't.
1137010	1137790	Therefore, I'm angry.
1139491	1140771	I bring mine to work every day.
1140791	1144252	Should I open my wound a little more so you can pour some more salt in there?
1144312	1150754	My box is inside of a bag out there and I actually bring it and toss it in the back of my car every day.
1152155	1152495	I don't know.
1152695	1155756	It was one of those rare cases that it worked.
1156650	1158511	I'm going to stick that fucking ferret in the box.
1158531	1159552	I'm going to put Senior Burrito in the box.
1159572	1161393	I don't get how they don't know what's wrong with it.
1161413	1164154	They're supposed to be spending more time on quality control.
1164854	1169977	I don't know if maybe Joe Quality Control was taking a break when your Xbox came down the line.
1169997	1173059	Maybe he was taking a piss and that's why Rob's Xbox doesn't work.
1173359	1174800	It worked for a little bit.
1175220	1179342	Here's what I don't get about the Xbox problems.
1179362	1181123	You'll be playing the system fine.
1181163	1181823	You shut it off.
1182143	1183304	Okay, everything's peachy.
1183384	1184164	You come back.
1184345	1184885	It doesn't turn on.
1185896	1186116	What?
1186536	1189797	You know, it's like, the Xbox can't break itself when you're not playing it.
1189938	1191218	I mean, that's really stupid.
1193679	1199241	Just know that you're supposed to watch water sports on the TV with your Xbox 360.
1199561	1204663	Not actually use your Xbox 360, you know, in the whole...
1208386	1210726	Let's see some of the fury in the chatroom.
1210746	1212447	Let's see if I have any supporters in chat right now.
1212467	1213287	I'm looking at chatroom here.
1213307	1213607	Let's see.
1215008	1217568	Dark Knight says, Rob, it had Windows 3.1 in it.
1218209	1218509	Maybe.
1218689	1219069	I don't know.
1219829	1220209	Let's see.
1221290	1221710	What do we have?
1221750	1224911	We have Rini says, In communist Russia, 360 breaks you.
1228866	1232168	I hear that George Bush runs on Windows.
1232248	1235729	Jaded2006 says, Actually, I'm only biased to Microsoft.
1235849	1236770	And tonight, I don't care.
1237110	1237350	Fine.
1237530	1237850	Go ahead.
1237910	1239291	Be more towards Microsoft.
1239611	1242692	DarkLionXVI says, That's why I never buy anything Microsoft.
1245193	1246054	Oh, and now here we go.
1246174	1246494	Here we go.
1246554	1247054	I'll see.
1247434	1249975	Now Tony is saying, I will dog on Sony.
1251236	1253297	And says, Luminous overrated.
1254297	1255778	PSP square button hurt.
1256960	1259181	Rini also wants to know, does Sky have a period tonight?
1260002	1261222	If I do, I have a good reason.
1261523	1263264	He has PMS all the time.
1263284	1265785	Just don't read too much into it.
1265945	1267446	Rob has PMS.
1267546	1268987	Putting up with Microsoft shit.
1269027	1269567	There you go.
1269787	1270227	Thank you.
1270728	1271168	Bravo.
1272049	1273049	I shake your hand, lady.
1273069	1274090	That was pretty good.
1274430	1275991	Smartest thing ever said on this show.
1276931	1277432	Hey!
1278832	1279793	I've said plenty of smart things.
1279813	1281394	No, I said smartest thing ever said on this show.
1282270	1283231	DarkSakura, speaking of Sony.
1283251	1284591	Why do we invite you on this show, Extover?
1284611	1285872	We know it's going to go down the toilet when...
1307577	1310219	Because every so often we need bleached asshole humor.
1310239	1311279	Because tonight I don't care.
1311580	1312400	I don't care tonight.
1312961	1315022	Rob is Mr. PMS apathy.
1315102	1316243	Let this be a bad show.
1316303	1317123	It'll match my mood.
1317163	1317564	I don't care.
1317844	1318244	Hey!
1319465	1323928	DarkSakura, save us and make this a quality show with a good story on Sony.
1324808	1326730	Sony and Microsoft recently... Oh.
1328371	1328831	Kill!
1331593	1332954	Okay.
1333274	1336016	Basically, we've got news about the PS3.
1337192	1337582	Yay.
1338840	1340280	Hooray, PS3, my butt.
1340460	1340800	Good.
1341321	1341961	Does it work?
1342401	1343461	That would be exciting news.
1344061	1349742	Well, we will be hearing interesting things about the current dev kits, but that's coming up in a little bit.
1351703	1362545	They're making a new online service called the PlayStation Network that's supposed to take basically what Xbox Live is doing and take it another step.
1362985	1368046	There will be an iTunes-like store that you can download films and music from.
1368484	1371427	You can use the console as a location free player.
1372368	1380275	So you can upload stuff from your PS3 onto your PSP and watch Blu-ray and DVD movies on your handheld.
1381095	1383758	Also, the PS3 will act as a digital video recorder.
1384478	1388942	You can save your television programs like you would with TiVo.
1389982	1393345	You also would be able to control the DVR function using your PSP.
1394926	1400450	As announced earlier, it'll play Blu-ray, but that's not going to really affect the price all that much.
1400510	1401190	It's supposed to...
1402990	1417844	They said that the Cell and RSX were going to be able to take care of most of it, so instead of paying the big prices you would for just a Blu-ray machine, instead you're just going to pay pretty much top console price, where you're looking at.
1418450	1422791	Of course, we haven't gotten an official word on what exactly that price is going to be.
1423751	1434674	Other couple things is that the dev kit was running faster than they predicted and that there are a bunch of games in development that they're putting out publicly for now.
1436134	1440255	Also, the PS3 should be getting regular firmware functionality updates like the PSP does.
1443254	1451217	One thing nice I'll say about Microsoft for the 24 hours or so that my system worked, I actually really liked how you could go online and download trailers.
1451277	1458600	Because I have a high-def TV, so I downloaded the X-Men 3 trailer and the Mission Impossible 3 trailer and watched it on the TV.
1458900	1460060	And I thought it was beautiful.
1460261	1461961	And there's no pixelation or anything.
1461981	1462862	I thought it was great.
1463722	1471845	So hearing that Sony is developing something similar, especially when you consider that Sony also has a major movie outlet and stuff with their iTunes-style store, that sounds pretty exciting to me.
1472245	1476526	There's also another thing that was stated, which a few people I'm sure should find exciting.
1478226	1478406	U.S.
1478446	1481147	developers have been told to prepare for a fall release.
1482607	1494230	So it should be sometime this year, which means that everywhere else in the world will have to wait until, what, summer 2007, while Japan has been playing it for most of the year.
1496390	1498931	Loki, do you have anything to add to this story about PlayStation 3?
1499111	1500531	Yeah, we'll be lucky to see it this year.
1501627	1501867	Really?
1502147	1502768	What makes you say that?
1502788	1503128	Really?
1503148	1503528	You think so?
1531616	1537717	People need to realize that just because it's a new console system does not mean that they need to pay $60 per game for stuff.
1537757	1539538	Just wait a couple weeks and it'll go used.
1543499	1544619	Any other comments on PlayStation 3?
1544779	1545599	You guys excited?
1546999	1548560	I'm trying not to be excited.
1548720	1550440	I'm containing my excitement.
1550520	1551900	I wish it would come out this year.
1551960	1554001	I mean, the longer they wait, it's kind of...
1554878	1555719	But you know what?
1556099	1556640	Here's what I've learned.
1556920	1559622	If they'll release a system that works, it's worth the wait.
1559942	1560683	Here's the race.
1561063	1562104	Which will come out first?
1562765	1564166	PlayStation 3 or Advent Children?
1566408	1566768	I don't know.
1566828	1567128	I don't know.
1567609	1567889	All right.
1568409	1569650	Let's go to a completely different topic.
1569730	1570051	Oh, look.
1570511	1571892	Look, I got a Microsoft story.
1571932	1572633	I'm so excited.
1573033	1574975	Actually, not really because it's cross-platform.
1575015	1581741	So I'm specifically addressing the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of Final Fantasy XI tonight.
1582501	1586204	and Final Fantasy XI recently had this big crackdown on gill sellers.
1587165	1602858	The other day, folks logged in and noticed if you did a scan of some of the very popular regions where folks usually are doing their gill farming, such as Kuftal Tunnel, because that's an area where you can camp Amunet or something like that.
1602998	1603399	Amimet?
1603719	1604039	Amimet?
1604179	1604520	Amimet?
1604640	1604920	I don't know.
1605200	1605881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1627717	1630759	I left the game a few months ago and now they're finally cracking down on this stuff?
1631300	1640247	Things that could have been done yesterday, I don't know if it's because of the impending Microsoft rollout that they thought, oh, maybe now's a good time to pay attention to what's going on here.
1640828	1643150	Or maybe with the expansion, or I don't know what.
1643530	1647534	Maybe they don't want to hear about it at their upcoming expo, but they finally banned all these guild sellers.
1648574	1649075	Good riddance!
1650011	1650591	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1670390	1674094	I did hear a rumor that the beta players would be able to transfer their characters over.
1687998	1688658	Well, goody for them.
1689099	1691580	Which would be cool, but I'm not going to buy it.
1691821	1694603	I would have loved to participate in the beta, but I can't right now.
1694983	1695543	Want to know why?
1695783	1696284	Want to know why?
1696604	1697044	I know why.
1698005	1702508	The other thing is the beta sign-ups are over, so there's double reasons.
1702528	1703248	You're double screwed.
1703969	1704329	Hooray.
1704349	1705470	It doesn't matter.
1705490	1706471	You didn't miss out on anything.
1706511	1711574	You loaded it up and you're like, wow, this looks exactly like the other one on the PC and on the PlayStation 2.
1711674	1716938	I wanted to see it on my pretty high screen, or high screen, high def, wide screen TV.
1718021	1718562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1738641	1739901	Well, a couple things.
1740082	1754867	First off, gay rights groups are calling Blizzard saying you need to change your World of Warcraft policies to basically be more clear on the different types of things.
1754887	1764670	Basically, the whole thing is they're saying that promoting a gay or lesbian friendly guild as harassment is just retarded and
1765250	1772061	You know, understand that the rules are in place for certain things, but they're kind of, the rules are too broad.
1772522	1779814	And so that, you know, they're using this to basically use it as it's not intended, so.
1781448	1782288	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1803373	1813740	I guess they kind of have come out and said where they stand, but they really need to clarify this because they are looking a little hypocritical with the, you know, slash silly that we talked about last week.
1813980	1824087	Basically, the comment was Stowall, a group founded in 1989, a professional lobbying group campaigning for the rights of lesbians and gay men and bisexuals.
1825068	1832673	Their spokesperson, Jonathan Finney, said, this attempt to create a safe and gay-friendly environment should be welcomed, not blocked.
1833273	1843115	and hopefully this is just a misunderstanding and would encourage Blizzard to review their policies and make sure that it has an effect or has an effect where it needs to be.
1843955	1844956	It's been over a week now.
1845536	1848476	I don't know if Blizzard's ever really going to do anything else on this.
1848516	1851377	I think they're just going to kind of let this keep going.
1852297	1855018	I would have thought if Blizzard was going to say something, we would have really heard it by now.
1855118	1858939	Besides, you know, we did get a clarification on a message board, but it wasn't good enough.
1859639	1860259	So, I don't know.
1861889	1863170	Xtifer, have a comment?
1864792	1870277	I was just going to ask you, Rob, didn't you report people in the general chat?
1870738	1871338	No, I didn't.
1872259	1875262	I was going to do it, and then I couldn't really figure out.
1875322	1876423	It was too complicated.
1876543	1879546	I know, I shouldn't have backed down, but I did.
1879706	1882209	I mean, the thing is, aside from that, though, is that
1883087	1890096	These people are saying all kinds of things in the general chat or whatever that are just really inappropriate.
1890116	1891037	It's just blasphemous.
1891097	1893500	It doesn't have any place in the game or whatever, and yet
1900629	1901230	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1919287	1922048	and so far I noticed the roleplay folks happen to be more mature.
1922368	1923528	At least in my experience.
1923588	1934171	It might just be the particular servers I've been picking, but in general, the roleplay server has been more mature overall and you don't get that bullshit Chuck Norris talk in the middle of town and stuff.
1934191	1934731	That isn't happening.
1934771	1937012	I don't know if it's because the server's new as well.
1937312	1938673	I tried out a new RP server.
1940453	1940773	I don't know.
1941273	1946895	But to be honest, the longer Blizzard goes without addressing this, I don't know how much longer I really want to keep playing this game.
1947355	1953377	Keep in mind that in the strict RP servers, you are not allowed to be out of character.
1954057	1954337	At all.
1955377	1963519	You can get kicked, basically, if they catch you being blatantly out of character without any sort of specific comment toward being out of character.
1964320	1967380	I actually roleplay a mute character because I don't ever talk to people.
1968121	1969521	I roleplay a mute character.
1970421	1971862	and I'm doing a very good job, actually.
1975023	1977464	I play an undead and all I say is brains.
1979345	1980026	Brains.
1980066	1980666	You dork.
1980946	1981246	All right.
1981566	1987469	Is there another follow-up regarding the whole concepts of sexuality in this MMO, Loki?
1987689	1988109	There is.
1988630	1993492	In Blizzard, there is basically a chat log posted about
1994296	1994916	and so on.
2013433	2017977	was trying to point out where is this actually in the documents here.
2017997	2033071	And the whole issue of the thing is that other players might not be mature enough and might take offense to this or start harassing other players, saying like, this night elf is camping my ass or something like that.
2033826	2048979	And so, you know, their excuse is basically, well, there's some players in World of Warcraft that aren't mature enough for this game, and so they might, you know, start harassing people, so therefore we can't, you know, give them some, it's basically, you know, they're saying they're flame bait, is, yeah.
2049969	2052231	So, clarify this for me, because this is something I didn't even realize.
2052271	2059597	Last week when I went off, I didn't even realize this, and I don't know how much longer I want to talk about this this week, but this is new news to me, so this is something new for the argument.
2059957	2063520	You're saying that male and female characters can get married in the game.
2064001	2064741	Apparently, I guess.
2064962	2067524	But I thought sexuality had no place in World of Warcraft.
2067804	2072508	Well, apparently it doesn't, unless it's heterosexual.
2072788	2073269	Oh, I see.
2073689	2075791	So yet another hypocrisy on Blizzard's part.
2075891	2077692	Oh, okay, just wanted to clarify that.
2077792	2078193	Thank you.
2079646	2086674	Not to mention, though, that Blizzard isn't the only MMO out there that doesn't allow gay marriage.
2086714	2088837	Final Fantasy XI, another one as well.
2088857	2091840	Yeah, but every Mithra on Final Fantasy XI is a gay man playing it anyway.
2092261	2092841	Just teasing.
2093042	2093823	Don't send the hate mail.
2093883	2094343	Just teasing.
2094423	2094984	I played one.
2095865	2096305	I know, I know.
2096346	2096746	I'm teasing.
2097647	2098828	Aren't you a gay man?
2098848	2099229	Shut up!
2100117	2110671	But no, seriously though, I can let that slide in that case because A, Final Fantasy XI doesn't give a crap about the GLBT guilds and all that stuff.
2110691	2112333	They let that stuff go on and that's fine.
2112714	2116979	And they can kind of pass it off as, you know, well, it doesn't really fit the...
2117700	2119882	The time period of the game.
2120363	2125787	And I'm okay with that because they don't make an issue of the guilds and the other stuff.
2125828	2135176	But now I have a problem with World of Warcraft because they've made an issue of all this other stuff saying sexuality has no place in the game, yet they do allow only the opposite sex marriage.
2135396	2144064	And in Final Fantasy XI, you don't know who's really a boy and who's really a girl, so there's probably same-gender weddings happening all the time, but it's all roleplay anyway, so I've gone cross-eyed.
2145424	2149407	Ami Damaru Flame says, I sent a message to an admin and I was told that's what ignore is for.
2173448	2175069	Oh, that's a lovely response.
2176009	2177810	Thanks, Blizzard.
2177890	2179871	Yet another inconsistency on Blizzard's part.
2180971	2182191	Let's see, what was the other one here?
2182832	2189294	Oh, Robway said, the rule should be no explicit sex talk within WoW, gay, straight, or beyond.
2189734	2191195	I'd be okay with that if it was consistent.
2191715	2192075	It's not.
2193376	2195377	I know, there just needs to be consistency.
2198078	2199138	Alright, moving on, new topic.
2201199	2203100	Let's go over to Jamie.
2203720	2205881	Completely opposite, different topic.
2207102	2210163	About as far away from this whole WoW debate as we can get.
2210243	2210903	What's going on, DarkSakura?
2210923	2215785	I'm sure the entire world really gives a crap about this, but EA signed Tiger Woods for six more years.
2217026	2220067	Oh, so we will continue to have the Tiger Woods golf games and...
2220580	2243705	which I don't really get because you know it would be something if they would actually sort of make changes in between the games but you know and this will probably make you happy the Xbox 360 version was supposed to be like crap they didn't it has the least amount of features to it but they have switched to like a whole analog scheme for how they're having it play but still do we need more Tiger Woods games can't he like retire like Madden did
2246659	2251162	As long as the guy is popular, games with his name attached to it are going to sell.
2251302	2253744	He is cute.
2253784	2257067	He's a very respectable sports figure.
2257207	2258708	I'm not a big sports fan.
2259089	2260470	I don't really follow any sports.
2261050	2262471	Everything from golf to football.
2262571	2264213	Notice how we're doing a show the day of the Super Bowl.
2264593	2267956	Obviously, I'm not following football.
2268016	2271218	Tiger Woods strikes me as one of the more respectable types of folks.
2271258	2271759	I would hit that.
2273651	2279294	He doesn't have to worry about what the games are going to net him because his golfing is still going to send money rolling in.
2279674	2283195	Personally, I'd rather play Happy Gilmore's PGA Tour 2006.
2284276	2284976	That would be a better game.
2284996	2286037	Moving on.
2293888	2294588	Thanks for watching!
2315502	2322106	Nintendo President Satoru Iwata will take time to talk about a couple new revolution details.
2322226	2325188	Now doubtful he's going to actually show any games in progress.
2325588	2327849	Probably just going to be little appetizers.
2328209	2329530	Just little flavorings.
2329610	2334313	He'll kind of let you smell what's cooking in the kitchen but won't really let you see what's going on there.
2334813	2337855	But nevertheless, all the Nintendo fanboys in the world are going...
2339096	2342198	Can't wait, just salivating for more information on the revolution.
2342778	2346901	Game Developers Conference is the time when there will be some more hints.
2347281	2350403	March 20th is the day of the Game Developers Conference.
2350443	2354726	And of course, when the news is unwrapped, we will bring it to you here on the show.
2355486	2357267	And might possibly be salivating ourselves.
2357447	2357768	We'll see.
2361070	2364312	Moving on, Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360 besides them breaking?
2367621	2372627	Well, actually, they're working on fixing certain problems with the systems glitching out.
2373168	2380116	They've actually had a firmware update or dashboard update to fix some of the guide problems that they've been having.
2380477	2384041	Also increased the accuracy of the last time played thing on there.
2385582	2386643	Which is kind of cool, I guess.
2386943	2392508	And then another great feature, disabling the kiosk disk from working anymore.
2392628	2396471	So trying to stomp out more homebrew.
2396531	2404859	We talked about that a couple weeks on the show, how the kiosk disk, somebody figured out how to copy it and play it on the Xbox 360, and they would say, oh, it's going to be this new way to expose homebrew.
2404879	2409382	Well, Microsoft just brought down the fist of justice on that, didn't they?
2410222	2411282	Well, yes and no.
2412163	2426547	Yes, they have, but no, they haven't because the actual files are on the hard drive, the update, and you could, in a sense, go back and either edit the update or delete the update and bring that all back.
2426627	2434230	It's not like a Sony firmware where you flash an actual chip and then you're screwed.
2434250	2434890	You're stuck with it.
2435810	2437451	Okay, interesting.
2438649	2441071	Alright, what's going on for the rest of the year?
2441772	2445376	What other things is Xbox 360 going to do this year besides break more systems?
2445756	2447158	Well, they actually have a lot of games coming out.
2447178	2447718	Do I sound bitter?
2447858	2448739	I'm sorry, do I sound bitter?
2448939	2450441	Yeah, just a little bit.
2450861	2452183	Lots of games have been announced.
2452583	2453264	There was actually...
2454286	2455648	Far Cry Instincts Predator
2475928	2478850	Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 2 Quake Wars
2499279	2504064	Lone the Dark, more inspiration for Ruibull, and SSX4.
2504124	2508067	Pretty much just a whole slew of games, a lot of tie-ins with movies.
2509288	2510650	Should be a really good year, though.
2512892	2514153	And that would be, you know what, forget it.
2514193	2515234	I'm just going to sound more bitter.
2516323	2517444	Stop being bitter.
2517584	2518104	I can't.
2518164	2518765	I can't help it.
2518785	2520166	That was a lot of money I spent.
2520726	2523748	Actually, I did have a comment regarding Yui Bull.
2523788	2529672	I didn't know if it had been addressed about the Metal Gear.
2529972	2531633	Yeah, we're going to talk about it.
2531673	2532594	It's coming up a little later.
2534161	2534421	All right.
2535902	2538743	Let's go ahead and go on to the revolution.
2539043	2541964	We're just ping-ponging between all the next-gen systems tonight.
2541984	2542604	That's all right, though.
2543064	2544104	You're confusing me.
2544465	2544685	I know.
2544725	2545085	I'm sorry.
2545125	2545945	Try not to go cross-eyed.
2545965	2546725	I went cross-eyed earlier.
2547286	2548126	I did that the other day.
2550487	2551587	See, you're bitter about that.
2551647	2552947	So you've got that to be bitter about.
2553308	2554268	No, no, no.
2554308	2555888	I'm not bitter about it.
2556009	2558609	It's just I couldn't see for 30 minutes.
2559230	2559510	Okay.
2559630	2560210	That was scary.
2562179	2564301	You couldn't see my Xbox 360 not working.
2564422	2565503	That's right.
2566124	2567746	Someone had to email me about that at work.
2570312	2577394	GameDaily.com posted this list called 10 Obscure Super Nintendo Games That We Want to Play on the Revolution.
2577934	2587296	I don't really know how newsworthy this is, but it may dig, and I thought it's a good thing to discuss on the show, a nice little topic to kind of bounce around.
2588236	2591197	I don't know why people always want to make lists, but here it is, another list.
2591377	2594618	Oh, we're going to be doing a list actually later tonight, so maybe I shouldn't be bashing it too much.
2595279	2600002	Here's their list of games they want to see playable on the Revolution in a little, like, emulation thing.
2600022	2601122	Because, of course, you know the Revolution.
2601142	2602723	You're supposed to be able to play old games on it.
2603483	2604344	Mario Paint.
2606065	2606805	Actraiser.
2607486	2609327	I thought Actraiser was a weird game to put on here.
2609347	2612588	Because I thought, isn't Revolution only supposed to do the first party games?
2612929	2615370	Or do we know about... I guess we really don't know if third party.
2615390	2617071	I guess it would be whichever ones sign on.
2617491	2617711	Right?
2617831	2619152	So, we'll see.
2619312	2620132	I guess it's a possibility.
2620312	2620913	Earthbound.
2621273	2621653	Good choice.
2622153	2622974	UN Squadron.
2625150	2631834	Moving on down the list, Legend of the Mystical Ninja, also known as Goemon, Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, Urban Strike.
2631914	2634575	Now even though that's three separate games, they're looping that into one.
2635215	2637516	Now see, I don't know, because that's more of a Genesis thing.
2637597	2640378	I attach those games to Genesis for me, but I don't know.
2641058	2644200	EVO, Search for Eden, Uniracers.
2645393	2646594	I don't know why that's on that list, but whatever.
2646614	2649717	I also thought it was weird that they said obscure Super Nintendo games.
2649737	2651879	I'm like, EarthBound wasn't that obscure.
2651899	2654201	I mean, sure, they never really, you know, they sat on a
2670692	2677616	Actually doing a sequel for a long, long time, and now it may not even come out here, but I don't know if it was obscure, but okay, whatever, whatever.
2677756	2678436	I'll look past that.
2679157	2681218	Anything that's missing from this list, you think?
2681318	2684399	Super Nintendo games that we ought to be able to play on the Revolution.
2685100	2685640	Slightly obscure.
2685860	2686721	Besides the big ones.
2686761	2688101	We all know Metroid, Zelda.
2688142	2688882	Besides the big ones.
2688962	2690583	Slightly obscure games, at least.
2690663	2691904	Anything that you think is missing.
2692964	2693464	I'll say one.
2693745	2695626	Here's an obscure game I used to love.
2696666	2699908	I know for a fact this won't be playable on Revolution, though, because it was a Sony game.
2701047	2703409	Equinox, the sequel to Solstice.
2703549	2704510	I loved that game.
2704930	2707613	I'd love to see that, but that's obviously me living in a fantasy world.
2709014	2709774	Anybody else want to add anything?
2710855	2712216	What was Equinox?
2713217	2715659	Did you ever play Solstice on the regular?
2715819	2718221	I'm having trouble remembering because I remember that.
2718482	2719983	It was a bit of a puzzle game.
2720023	2723886	It was like 3D isometric type thing and you kind of walked around.
2723906	2724707	It had square movements.
2724892	2725192	StarFox
2746198	2748320	Okay, yeah, that's a good one, that's a good one.
2748760	2750641	Definitely a first party title a lot of folks want to see.
2751022	2751702	Loki, nothing?
2752863	2756226	You know, I didn't play that many Super Nintendo games, and it's really sad.
2756286	2759628	I liked Super Mario RPG.
2760369	2762871	I think that'd be one that they would probably do.
2765993	2769776	Let's see, other than that, you know, it really wasn't too much.
2770496	2773999	I was a huge fan of Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is kind of like,
2774757	2776719	A cheap version of Sonic the Hedgehog.
2776759	2777779	Wow.
2777819	2778440	Now that's obscure.
2778460	2780882	That was one of the first games I had, which is weird.
2781342	2787286	Freaking Dracula X. But the Super Nintendo port was assy compared to the original.
2787787	2795613	I think that they could have, it would have been prohibitively expensive because you have this whole other scenario with Maria that they just didn't do.
2795773	2799876	Maybe they could say, okay, now that we have revolution technology, here's Dracula X the way it should have been.
2800447	2808771	And of course, all of us who have these $300 copies of Dracula X for PC Engine are going to find their copy now worth $50.
2810692	2813153	Let's see what the chat room has to say over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2813173	2813753	Click on chat.
2813813	2816074	WonderDog Harold says, Zombies ate my neighbors.
2816634	2817054	Oh, hell yes.
2817074	2817915	Oh, my God, yes.
2818835	2822157	I'd like to see a new version of that or put it on Xbox Lives Arcade.
2822197	2822697	That would be great.
2822777	2823757	Or Smash TV.
2823777	2825198	Super Smash TV.
2825218	2826518	Fire Bulma said Smash TV.
2826659	2827679	There you go.
2827719	2829060	Rini says Yoshi's Island.
2829440	2829720	Yes.
2830247	2830667	There you go.
2830687	2832968	Yoshi's Cookie.
2833168	2835328	PK Akira 88, Yoshi Safari.
2835628	2836628	Remember the Super Scope one?
2836828	2838669	Wasn't that the Super Scope one where you run around?
2838689	2841149	It's all about the mole game.
2842569	2844430	Where you shot moles with the Super Scope.
2845330	2845910	I don't remember that.
2845950	2849691	It was just the generic cartridge that came with it, but there was like the games like Blasterous and something else.
2849711	2850351	The Super Scope 6 game.
2850411	2850831	I don't know.
2850891	2851631	I was pretty ghetto.
2851651	2852711	I had the Sega Menacer.
2853432	2854032	Dude, cool.
2854152	2855612	The Menacer was cool because you could take it apart.
2856512	2858093	Yeah, it sucked though.
2858213	2858973	I still have a Menacer.
2859213	2859453	Really?
2859833	2860153	All right.
2861055	2862456	ToeJam & Earl Secret of Mana!
2879688	2889833	Let's go over and open up the mailbag because DarkSakura, she likes to open up your email and you guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaundredo.com and she reads them.
2889913	2892614	And then I have a good laugh.
2893254	2895415	She laughs at the hate mail and then reads some of the good ones on air.
2895896	2897916	I don't get hate mail.
2898297	2899217	I get love mail.
2899497	2902959	Before we start mailbag, see now they're going to send you hate mail because you said you don't get hate mail.
2902979	2903299	No, yes I do.
2904181	2906703	Before we start Mailbag tonight, if I may, on a personal note.
2906763	2907124	No.
2907584	2910827	Because I got some emails directly to my personal email address this week.
2911347	2919994	And, you know, last week on the show, I had a coming out of sorts because I never mentioned, you know, the fact that I was gay until we talked about the World of Warcraft thing.
2920635	2923117	Although folks who've been listening to the live show knew it for a long time.
2923177	2924658	I actually thought it was in my bio.
2925059	2928341	I didn't realize that folks who've been listening to the podcast for so long didn't know it.
2928401	2929602	So it kind of was a coming out of sorts.
2930103	2932205	And I just want to say I got some...
2932925	2943773	really amazing emails of support from people you know from all across it didn't matter if they were straight, gay, you know whatever I just got some amazing emails that really just
2945003	2946164	Make Me Remember Why I Do This
2969105	2979994	Like, to me, to my email, which is X-T-O-F-E-R at orangelonsradio.com I will gladly read them and possibly comment on them.
2980355	2981296	Yeah, except there's a difference.
2981336	2982296	See, I came out as gay.
2982316	2983457	You're coming out as an asshole.
2984318	2985279	A bleached one.
2986080	2986780	I'm just messing with you.
2986880	2987621	A bleached one.
2987741	2988342	Bad joke.
2988782	2989403	Bad old joke.
2989783	2990524	I like men, too.
2990784	2991304	Where was the mailbag?
2991344	2992405	Oh, yes, there's the mailbag.
2993646	2995508	Let's move on to the mailbag, shall we, DarkSakura?
2996549	2996609	Um...
2997523	2997863	Hi!
2998223	2998444	Okay.
2999464	3003106	I actually went over my limit because I got a bunch of emails this week again.
3003667	3007209	So the first one I'm going to bring up is sent by Malice.
3007809	3010671	I'm just going to read this as a question actually put forth to us.
3011511	3013353	I was wondering if you people knew about this.
3013413	3015594	I wish to know more about it before I purchase it.
3016209	3024598	Skipping forward, it seems to be a special edition of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with a 30 minute prologue CG or animation.
3025219	3027341	It's apparently a budget title as it is $20.
3027381	3030024	I want to know what you guys think about it before I shell out the cash.
3032987	3035090	I don't really think anything of Grand Theft Auto, so...
3037443	3040305	I defer to Loki because I don't really play these games either.
3040445	3048309	It's just the platinum hit or greatest hits or whatever version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because they've sold millions and millions of copies.
3048870	3050731	So it came out at a new low price of $19.95.
3050831	3053593	And that's all it really is.
3054193	3064039	And of course, every now and then, the new trend now, especially with Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, they release little added features as well on top of dropping the price of the game.
3064239	3066220	A little extra something.
3067096	3075820	For me, I'm going to be honest, even though I understand why the game gets a lot of critical praise and all that stuff, it's kind of one of those games that's fun for me for a couple days and then I'm kind of tired of it.
3076440	3082803	It is a game that you can literally play up, pick up, play the missions, or just fuck around.
3083244	3084704	And it's really cool.
3084784	3085305	It's really fun.
3085645	3088026	San Andreas is definitely the best one in the series so far.
3088146	3092468	So, I mean, $20 for that game, you can play it for hours and hours and not get bored of it.
3093648	3094749	I highly recommend it.
3094769	3096650	The storyline is really good in it too.
3096710	3098490	Plus you get a main character named Jizzy.
3099591	3100411	No, it's CJ.
3101032	3102372	Oh, I thought it was Jizzy.
3103132	3103653	No, it's not Jizzy.
3103673	3104493	I'm calling him Jizzy.
3105313	3106514	That's only in the hot coffee mod.
3107274	3108095	Alright, next email.
3109255	3111576	Okay, this one comes from MisaSky.
3113157	3118659	It's titled Fantasy Star Universe vs. Final Fantasy XI as in EKS, EYE.
3118719	3119500	I thought that was cute.
3120380	3120460	Um...
3121414	3126262	Hello, I love the new format you guys are giving the show, and I kind of want you to debate on something if you can.
3127023	3129366	A couple months ago, I got Final Fantasy XI for my PC.
3129486	3136257	My father would allow me to play as long as I got good grades, so there's my copy of Final Fantasy XI sitting in the corner, crying and gathering dust.
3137014	3140176	I also recently found out about the new Corsair job, and I think it looks pretty.
3140716	3144459	I would buy and play the game just because of the sexy outfits for the Corsair job.
3144539	3149041	Now, I have recently gotten back with my PSO community, and they are getting ready for Phantasy Star Universe.
3149442	3153504	This game, too, is also very sexy, mainly because of all the new weapons and new character creator.
3154084	3157466	I would like to stick with one MMO, but they seemed so good.
3157586	3160588	I have $70 to waste importing PSU from my...
3162299	3165263	Station of Playing 2 is looking very good right now.
3165503	3165943	So what do you think?
3165963	3171009	Well, it's tough because I haven't really played Phantasy Star Universe.
3171029	3178658	I played a little bit at the E3 demo kiosk, but I can only really go off my experience with Phantasy Star Online and how it might be a little bit different.
3179519	3180079	Here's the thing.
3180680	3182242	Here's the biggest difference between the two games.
3182522	3185004	It's basically fundamentally how the attack systems work.
3185044	3191310	In Phantasy Star, you hit a button to literally swing your sword, so it's more of an action-based MMO.
3191670	3200799	Whereas in Final Fantasy XI, you're auto-swinging your sword and you're doing other things with that, such as your weapon skills or your magic or whatever.
3200839	3204262	It's more of a quote-unquote traditional-style RPG game.
3204742	3205563	in MMO form.
3205603	3206303	It's a little hard to explain.
3206343	3210406	It's not like other Final Fantasies at all because the battle system is so much different.
3210726	3212847	Although if you played the 12 demo, it's kind of similar to the 12 demo.
3214884	3215504	Thank you for watching!
3237958	3238878	I'd say go play World of Warcraft.
3238898	3238978	Stop.
3264383	3268405	No, seriously, if you want a cool, actual good game, I mean, play World of Warcraft.
3270326	3274047	Stay away from Final Fantasy XI because it'll just make you sad.
3275468	3277829	Well, at least don't be a white mage.
3278089	3280890	Was your experience... Because you become the bitch of the party.
3280910	3283111	Yeah, but same thing with a priest in WoW.
3284172	3286653	Did you have a bad experience with Final Fantasy XI, Extover?
3286813	3288894	Well, it just seemed like every single time...
3290640	3295623	Let me just give the game a little bit of credit, because I did actually enjoy playing it a lot.
3295783	3301947	But the thing is, it just got really tiring on having to try and find a party all the freaking time.
3302447	3306650	And also, when I was in a party, it was just like drama.
3307070	3308311	It was just so much drama.
3308371	3313534	I'd rather deal with drama in a guild on World of Warcraft where I can just leave it and say, you know...
3314014	3315614	Screw you guys, I'm going home.
3315754	3316414	You know, whatever.
3316474	3321795	But, like, on Final Fantasy XI, I mean, you're, like, blackbooked.
3322896	3330597	If you're, like, really bad in a party without intending to be, people really remember that, and they don't want you in your party anymore.
3331837	3332437	Alright, next email.
3332457	3334838	People kept wanting me in their stupid party.
3335818	3337718	But I hated them, and I let the tank die on purpose.
3338738	3342119	Because, okay, I told you about the party I was in with the tank who was a jerk.
3342739	3343199	I let him die.
3344073	3344854	There's jerks in every game.
3344874	3345914	The rest of the party thanked me.
3346355	3347235	There's jerks in every game.
3348696	3353920	Next up comes from... Okay, for a moment I could not hear myself on the microphone.
3354580	3357602	This one comes from Steve, who... Hi, Steve!
3357622	3361105	I think I'm going to start doing that with all the people that email us.
3361125	3361805	I'm going to say hi to them.
3361845	3362566	So, hi, Steve!
3363566	3368089	Steve is... Actually, I'm going to say right now a very kind soul.
3368109	3368950	Mm-hmm.
3369574	3370915	For other reasons we might discuss later.
3371955	3379799	But he was actually sending me questions looking for information on Judy Crystal about other songs that she did.
3380600	3388143	And I had sort of been into Judy Crystal for a little bit, but not like majorly, majorly.
3388864	3393606	But basically Judy Crystal did God of Romance in DDR.
3393766	3397348	Here's a little clip of God of Romance, just in case you're not unfamiliar with Judy Crystal.
3397368	3397448	Yes.
3401141	3430406	Summer is a place where we have to be Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy Okay Which is actually a remake of Romance of Nokami-sama Uh-huh Which I've played in pre-shows before Maybe I'll put it in next week's pre-show But at any rate, she also did Tokyo Already, Baby Love Me, You Can't Hurry Love And Nori, Nori, Nori
3431013	3431573	Oh yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.
3449061	3450482	JB, way back when.
3450522	3451823	He was a big Judy Crystal fan.
3452143	3452944	Oh, that's right.
3453464	3455906	I'll try to hunt him down if he still keeps up with us.
3456307	3457307	I think I know where to find him.
3457568	3458288	Ask me again offline.
3458308	3458969	I'll tell you where to find him.
3459069	3460190	Okay.
3460590	3468676	But yeah, she's been on like a bajillion Parapara compilations, including one of the big ones by the Parapara All-Stars.
3469017	3469157	So...
3470680	3472542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3488309	3510369	um basically and I had actually intended on going back and making a public apology to the one who I said I didn't think is being very professional over the whole Mac thing being a graphic artist given that Mac is the standard for graphic artists but um there are people who are very prone toward PC maybe had a bad experience with a Mac
3512372	3514734	I'm not going to even look at Loki right now.
3514854	3515875	Just call it truce.
3516015	3518116	Let's keep it moving.
3518196	3523840	But for the sake of the show, I am no longer joining the debate.
3524041	3534849	I am going to buy my... I'm actually getting a Mac for my birthday because I intend on being more serious with my art and I'd see that as a natural progression for myself as an artist.
3535009	3535409	Good for you.
3536932	3558529	and I say that coffin not only needs to have the last nail shoved into it whatever you're thinking Loki, swallow it and it needs to be set on fire like your Xbox Loki's laughing in the corner there swallow it I'm just saying I don't bring it up every week everyone else brings it up they try to drag me back into this I don't really care you know what
3559918	3561279	Sorry if it seemed offensive.
3561539	3573109	I don't aim to offend, but that was how I felt that it just sort of blindsided me because every professional graphic artist I know, and I know a lot of them.
3573169	3574050	I live in California.
3575070	3576912	Every last one of them uses a Mac.
3577552	3580755	So I was just really sort of blindsided by that one.
3580935	3581956	But that was where I came from.
3584497	3590503	In defense, a little bit, tiny bit, I don't want to go too far, but I did used to work for a publishing company, and we used both.
3591184	3591604	We used both.
3592785	3596389	There's some things PC does better, some things Mac does better, just depends on how you use it.
3596569	3599772	I use both, and I don't have a preference, actually.
3599912	3600493	I like both.
3600653	3602555	I'm actually digging the Mac OS Tiger.
3602575	3602815	Yeah.
3606019	3607100	You're bi-computeral?
3607280	3607841	I am.
3607881	3608362	You're totally bi?
3608382	3609403	I am freaking bi.
3609864	3610765	I'm tri-computeral.
3611546	3613129	Because I have some Linux love now.
3614130	3614511	Alright.
3614851	3615312	Woo!
3616293	3616714	Anyway.
3617134	3617955	Anyway, anyway, anyway.
3618276	3620259	Simultaneous loving, baby.
3621160	3621841	This is kind of...
3625244	3631267	I'm going to paraphrase because some of it seems a little bit more personal than I'm comfortable going into.
3633848	3636150	One of our listeners, James, sent in an email.
3636190	3636890	Hi, James!
3637671	3638071	Rob!
3639232	3639752	You know what, Rob?
3639892	3641613	I'm going to say this fair to you.
3643734	3647096	You're going from Mr. Stress, I hate the Xbox, to hi!
3647696	3650638	I'm trying to turn that angst into something more useful in this world.
3650698	3652599	It's not useful.
3652920	3653440	Go back to angst.
3653460	3653660	Zip it!
3654582	3655303	Angst is hot.
3656884	3658086	Except for when it's hot.
3658146	3659227	Read your email!
3660188	3661048	That is so hot.
3662009	3676503	Basically, it was saying that things were fairly rough, and then DDR was out, the DDR Extreme, and I was absolutely addicted to it.
3678605	3678806	But...
3680370	3689618	was talking about how it was sort of alienating to you, because when, you know, you know how a lot of us went through that, being, when we played DDR, there was just a, oh, you played that game, you know?
3690119	3697325	Oh, like the taunting of the other people at the arcades, you know, and like, oh, the, you know, the fags playing DDR, you know, just get over it.
3697365	3705432	He also said, though, that he was playing in a small crowd gathered around, we all, we know how the crowd goes, and then he met his best friend that way, and has met many more friends through the game.
3706012	3707834	And I was thinking a lot of us were like that, you know?
3709691	3711452	We all met through DDR.
3711872	3716473	I met my very best friend in the universe through DDR.
3717553	3722255	It's opened all kinds of doors, not just for me personally, for all of us.
3723895	3725675	We started off as a DDR show.
3726456	3727356	That was our thing.
3728599	3738767	We even came up with the concept and the name on the BART going to San Francisco to play DDR at the Metreon.
3740248	3741349	If that's not nerdy enough.
3744651	3746893	I'm sorry for paraphrasing it.
3747193	3756020	I didn't want to give a written response to it until I actually had a chance to read it on the air, but I have to say that good for you.
3756616	3758356	I also got an email from Danny
3786499	3787142	Hi Dani!
3788487	3791739	She writes in and says thank you for the Rick Sanchez interview.
3792566	3792746	Agreed.
3821280	3822781	Did GameTamp plant that email?
3822841	3823361	No, I'm kidding.
3823622	3824442	That's great.
3824682	3828024	They'd be very happy to hear that, and I think that's what they're trying to do, so it's great.
3828064	3833768	I also do think there are a few trusted emulation sites that I know of.
3833968	3836049	I'm not going to go into them on the air right now.
3836710	3844755	But you really do, if you're new into the emulation scene, you really do have to wade through piles of crap before you get to the good stuff, you know?
3845484	3848747	So I actually think that that is a fabulous idea.
3849007	3855553	And on top of that, I think that a lot of the older games that we're seeing through GameTap had a lot more value to them.
3855713	3860998	I think these were games where they could not focus on graphics.
3861558	3863820	These were games that had solid gameplay.
3864361	3865682	A lot of the ones that are up on there.
3865702	3866663	A lot of the classics.
3867456	3871858	I swear, I watch Rob play it all the time, and I'm very impressed.
3871898	3874239	If I had the money, I would subscribe to it.
3874659	3877480	But I mean, it's very well done.
3879061	3881082	I'm actually thinking of doing it.
3881522	3885143	If it wasn't that I was in school right now, I would totally do it.
3885263	3887624	But after the show, I get to go home and paint some more.
3889445	3889725	Two more.
3891886	3892987	One of them is from Sakurina.
3893107	3893987	Hi, Sakurina.
3894327	3895248	We like Sakurina.
3895348	3896228	Hello, Sakurina.
3897767	3902528	This has to do with the gate removal thing.
3903188	3904109	Oh, in Animal Crossing, yes.
3904449	3904649	Right.
3904989	3910410	From what I've read on various gaming blogs, the removal of gates is caused by a glitch having something to do with pitfall seeds.
3910470	3911590	I've read this a couple of places too.
3912431	3916632	Therefore, anyone who falls into a pitfall somewhere in town could trigger this glitch to remove the gate.
3917972	3921853	I thought that that would be cleared up in case one of the people in our friend code thread happened to...
3923587	3924307	have it happen to them.
3926089	3937441	For the record, we do have an open forum on our website in our forum section for our Animal Crossing players to share friend codes and when you'll have your gate open and blah, blah, blah.
3938662	3941585	Okay, last one from Mike.
3941966	3942627	Hi, Mike.
3943968	3944629	Mike is awesome.
3945690	3945770	Um,
3947154	3952535	He said EGM did a top 200 games on their list for their 200th issue.
3953935	3960377	I actually needed to grab that issue of EGM because I sort of got it out of EGM, but every so often I pick them up just to see what's going on.
3962237	3967078	But now these were their top 10 games.
3967118	3968118	Number 10 was Pong.
3968138	3969998	9 was Grand Theft Auto 3.
3970938	3972579	8 was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
3972819	3973539	He said it should be number 1.
3974814	3984616	7 was Space Invaders, 6 was Super Mario 64, 5 Legend of Zelda, 4 Tetris, 3 Street Fighter 2, 2 Pac-Man, 1 Super Mario Bros.
3985296	3985856	I saw that.
3986216	3987777	I actually read the magazine the other day.
3987957	3989877	That's a pretty good list.
3990377	3994038	I'm pretty happy with that list as compared to most of these top games of all time lists.
3994058	3998639	The only one, I'm not big on the Mario 64 as many people are.
3998879	3999499	I don't know why.
3999559	4002340	I love Mario 64, but I also have very fond memories of it.
4005071	4007312	I know a lot of other people are really into it, it's just not my thing.
4007372	4017674	Honorable Mentions, 12 Metal Gear Solid, 17 Halo, 46 Resident Evil 4, 74 Chrono Trigger, that should be much further up there, 92 Super Smash Bros.
4017714	4028797	Melee, 196 Guitar Hero, which has been played non-stop in my house all day, 178 DDR, 172 Katamari Damashii, no version of Puyo Puyo,
4029890	4030371	at all.
4030871	4032453	And that is a crying shame.
4032593	4033614	No Final Fantasy mentions.
4033654	4034435	Well, I'm sure it's in the list.
4034495	4038979	It's got to be somewhere, but I'm kind of surprised Final Fantasy 7 didn't crack the top 10 a little bit.
4039299	4041401	But no Peel Peel.
4041862	4046506	You have to have been paying attention to know that I am like this uber Peel Peel fan.
4047707	4051711	We had it as Peel Pop, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Kirby's Avalanche.
4053473	4054234	That breaks my heart.
4055354	4056214	I'm closing the mailbag.
4056555	4056895	All right.
4057055	4057775	Pulling the strings.
4058295	4061916	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us some email.
4062077	4064557	And we might read your email on the air if we feel like it.
4066138	4070740	One thing that also seems like it's going to happen whenever somebody feels like it is Duke Nukem Forever.
4071180	4073801	Loki, what the heck is going on with Duke Nukem Forever?
4074541	4077622	If you believe it or not, it's actually still being worked on.
4078823	4080543	Right now, they had an interview.
4080683	4081624	I believe it was on 1UP.
4084056	4084556	Let's see here.
4084596	4089019	Yeah, on one up, talking to co-founder of 3D Realms.
4089799	4094262	And basically, in the interview, they brought up Duke Nukem Forever.
4094722	4098964	And actually, it says that a lot of it's been finished.
4099304	4101566	All the guns are finished, and most of the creatures are finished.
4101606	4103247	And basically, they're putting together the pieces.
4103427	4111971	So they said it's possible, it's possible, cross your fingers, you might see Duke Nukem Forever coming out in 2006.
4113905	4114810	We'll see.
4116357	4119039	I'm looking at chatroom feedback to the top 200 list right now.
4119499	4121080	Over to OrnisonTrader.com, click on chat.
4121340	4125903	NintendoManiac64 says, Metroid Prime, Super Metroid.
4126183	4129225	I think Super Metroid's the game I would have had in the top 10 instead of Mario 64.
4129265	4131406	Metroid Prime was in the top 200, though.
4131466	4133287	Super Metroid needs to be one of those emulated games.
4133428	4135209	Super Metroid needs to be... Yeah, I love Super Metroid.
4135229	4136970	It recognizes one of the best video games of all time.
4136990	4137470	It really is.
4137730	4138791	It's an incredible game.
4138991	4140532	I think it was in the list, though, too.
4140812	4144114	I also have very positive memories of Super Metroid because...
4144554	4146816	I would lay on the couch and watch Dan play all the way through it.
4147657	4149418	And that was together time over video games.
4150619	4150819	Aww.
4151000	4151840	I love that game.
4151860	4152481	Shut up!
4153061	4155483	Any type of Metroid game is... Rob.
4155784	4155984	Yes.
4156024	4156264	Rob.
4156684	4156885	Rob.
4157625	4157845	Rob.
4158366	4158546	Rob.
4158606	4158786	What?
4158946	4159267	Rob.
4159427	4159607	Rob.
4159647	4159807	What?
4160227	4160448	Hi.
4162389	4163130	Hi, Jamie!
4165131	4166172	RedRuth.GreenBean.org TildaBen.4cr
4186890	4191511	slash SMB underscore super underscore synth dot SWF.
4191551	4195232	It's the Super Mario Brothers Audio Sound Super Synthesizer.
4195252	4205353	And essentially what they've done on this, and I'm playing with it right now, is they've taken all these sounds from Mario Brothers and basically stripped them all out so that you can make your own remixes.
4205753	4208054	So I'm going to remix something right here on the air right now.
4208134	4208674	So here we go.
4211214	4213315	Let's all do the Mario.
4213375	4213995	Oops, I fucked up.
4215583	4234614	Let's all do the Mario, come on it's time to go to Mario I've got a lot of coins, woo, Mario Da da da, swing your hands from side to side See, and I can do this in my room late at night when no one's watching That's the only place you should be doing that Yeah
4235334	4237256	We'd rather not hear about anything else.
4237997	4238557	Right.
4239158	4240439	That subject's over.
4240519	4242240	Yeah, I won't be doing any more stories this hour.
4242280	4246444	Let's go over to Loki, who has something of a bit more serious nature.
4247765	4248105	Yes.
4248906	4253410	It's another game that's getting more flack from people.
4253470	4254131	And this one is...
4258223	4263484	The Association for American Indian Development Calls for the Gun Boycott
4277236	4289969	What's funny though is they failed to mention that actually in the game the Native Americans are portrayed very positively and also it's very accurate to the time period
4291169	4296492	The Slaughtering of Renegade Apaches, The Atrocity of the Indian Scalping, and The Misinformation of Indian Traditions of Killing Sacred White Animals
4306805	4315172	The petition requests that Activision remove all derogatory, harmful, and inaccurate depictions of American Indians from Gun and reissue the game.
4315912	4321837	Not going to happen because the game is like $29 right now, and if they could sell it cheaper, they probably would.
4322958	4326401	It wasn't a very good game, just so you know.
4327782	4334667	On a completely different note, when you work for a game company, you have to sign what's called an NDA, a Non-Disclosure Agreement.
4335322	4337963	DarkSakura, tell us about the dark side of NDAs.
4338043	4340124	Are they drug out in the street and shot?
4340164	4341665	What happens when people violate those NDAs?
4342025	4342706	Usually just fired.
4345067	4352751	But there was a former employee of Sony Online Entertainment that was...
4355194	4359296	He spoke out about criticizing the PlayStation 3 and was fired.
4360797	4362797	He was an artist, Josh Robinson.
4363258	4369060	Just to give a quote here, all I really did was write a few paragraphs that gave my opinion on publicly released information.
4369620	4371121	I didn't reveal any tech info.
4371221	4373862	I didn't reveal different shipping plans.
4374963	4379185	I'm still in awe of the whole uproar over what amounts to no information.
4380865	4384768	Basically, he posted in his blog that says, our game just keeps getting moved back and back and back.
4385128	4385989	And where is the box?
4386029	4386969	Where is the final system?
4386989	4387770	When is it coming out?
4387850	4388410	No one knows.
4388890	4391992	And in the meantime, people in the industry are starting to get just a little salty.
4392853	4398856	You could always tell where the PS3 dev box was because it's the room that had the F-bomb coming out of it half the day.
4401058	4404400	But he basically got sacked for it.
4406230	4433953	another quote here I talked with the people on the technical side of the Xbox 360 the consistent comment I am hearing from people on my end is the Xbox 360 is better oh snap they are saying that it is capable of just doing more hmm he also talked to at least two Sony employees who read the blog entry before it was posted and showed it to a producer and he said again another quote we were all in agreement that I was not breaking NDA with what I was saying
4436052	4438113	They were just upset that he was bad-mouthing him.
4438193	4439994	Yeah, I think it's more one of those, too.
4440174	4445176	He tried to find something to sack him with since he opened his mouth and was critical.
4445216	4445816	How dare he?
4446577	4450018	How dare he speak the minds of everybody about this subject?
4450138	4456121	And might I be the first to say the Xbox 360 can be more powerful than the PlayStation 3 all at once, but it's going to have to work first.
4456501	4457781	There's a little bit more.
4458162	4458782	Just another quote.
4459823	4461204	It was something unfortunate to happen.
4461244	4463246	I sincerely hope Sony isn't damaged by it.
4463306	4467830	In fact, I cannot say enough nice things about the CEO and VP of the company.
4468470	4469911	Did I knowingly break NDA?
4470031	4471332	I absolutely did not.
4471472	4473934	I would never do that and would never want to hurt Sony Online.
4474355	4476596	Did I dance in the gray area by even opening my mouth?
4476717	4478558	Yes, I did and I was fired for it.
4479158	4484463	He did say, however, that he received four or five job offers immediately after leaving Sony and got a book deal as a result of the article.
4485160	4485820	Loser.
4486321	4486541	What?
4486761	4487081	Loser.
4487221	4487461	Why?
4488001	4491043	Well, first off, he's contradicting himself in his own quotes.
4491403	4498086	He says, we haven't seen a dev kit or anything like that, and he also says that the Xbox 360 is capable of more.
4498247	4501048	How do you know it's capable of more if you haven't received the final kit yet?
4501348	4505010	He said that, from what I read, that his group hasn't received a dev kit.
4505030	4508932	They did say there was a dev kit because of all the cursing coming from the room it was located in.
4509417	4510978	Yeah, but it's not a final system yet.
4511219	4512139	That doesn't mean anything.
4512159	4514741	They don't even have any working demos.
4514761	4517163	They're all just live renders and that's it.
4517664	4519545	So, I think it's a bunch of crap.
4519625	4523609	I think someone's bitter because someone bad-mouthed Sony and got fired for it.
4524089	4525130	Oh, book deal.
4525410	4525971	Good for you.
4526051	4527512	I don't think anyone's going to be buying that one.
4528213	4538361	Actually, I do believe it is a state law that as long as you do not break your NDA, you are entitled to state whatever you want to as long as you are not using your company's facilities to do it.
4540077	4544200	As long as you are posting this as yourself through your own private means.
4544581	4549264	That's actually in several HR handbooks for different companies I've worked for within the state.
4549424	4556229	At the same time, if he's not a contracted worker, though, most companies have policies, we can terminate your employment for any reason we feel like.
4557010	4560253	But saying that they were doing it over breaking NDA, I think that that's a bit extreme.
4561774	4567238	The last quote on here is, I guess the new rule for me is don't ever say anything about anything ever, ever.
4568635	4569496	Oops, too late.
4569576	4570878	When in doubt, keep your mouth shut.
4571358	4574122	Gee, you thought that wasn't a bad idea?
4574362	4575363	I mean, come on.
4575684	4584615	I know, and in retrospect, I think that it was a really bad idea for him to speak out about it because, I mean, seriously, he works for a company that
4586156	4589539	He had his posts pre-screened, but that's not going to do anything.
4590099	4595783	That would be almost as dumb as saying, I didn't think yelling that I had a bomb in an airport was a bad thing.
4597004	4599065	I checked with the airport, and they said it was okay.
4600506	4603068	I was just exercising my freedom of speech.
4604009	4605009	Alright, let's move on.
4605370	4607851	Speaking of freedom of speech... Not really, though.
4609542	4614227	Extra for one reason we had to have you on the show tonight is because you watch American Idol an awful lot, right?
4614687	4615108	I do.
4615128	4615968	You love American Idol.
4616269	4617950	I don't, but I still watch it.
4617991	4618671	It's like crack.
4618731	4619232	I don't know why.
4619412	4625398	Did you catch the video game, somewhat video game or at least anime-related reference on American Idol this week?
4625478	4625878	I didn't.
4626119	4626499	Get this.
4626519	4628701	There was this guy who auditioned on American Idol.
4628741	4630383	Check out what he did for his audition.
4630403	4630463	Yay!
4637273	4638874	What is up with Austin, man?
4638994	4640255	What is up with Austin, man?
4660447	4662307	I'll bet you anything, though, that was creative editing.
4662428	4666148	Like, maybe the producers got him to do that and then, like, spliced in the reaction shots.
4666168	4667429	They do that all the time on that show.
4667469	4668429	I know they do that stuff.
4668469	4669169	That show's so fake.
4670009	4670469	So fake.
4670669	4671070	It is.
4671970	4675170	Not everybody that shows up at those locations get picked.
4675230	4676591	Reject false icons, right, Jamie?
4677531	4677891	Yes.
4678351	4679732	All of them and set them on fire.
4680292	4680552	All right.
4680812	4681572	Unless they're crack.
4683669	4685350	In that case, watch American Idol.
4685850	4687971	And hate it every minute of it, but still watch it.
4688091	4689652	Loki, take us to a new topic.
4689672	4691072	What's going on with Dragon Quest?
4691512	4693413	It's selling like hotcakes.
4693433	4700997	The Dragon Quest series, actually, Dragon Quest VIII has crossed the 4 million units mark of worldwide shipments.
4701977	4703958	And this figure also includes 430,000 shipped to U.S.,
4706860	4708142	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
4728173	4737223	Dragon Quest is a game that was really big in Japan, of course.
4737263	4740506	A huge, huge series in Japan that's now catching on over here.
4740867	4742909	But that takes us into the final story for this segment.
4743269	4744731	Why is it the Japanese games...
4745211	4745952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4767216	4773384	In comparison, the US market has a much greater demand for Japanese titles.
4773424	4781796	The article goes on to say, "...the cause of this problem appears to be the result of a combination of ignorance and apathy from American publishers towards the Japanese market."
4782256	4792083	Whereas Japanese publishers are willing to go the extra mile and carry out excellent localizations, their American counterparts seem reluctant to even bother getting their games translated to Japanese.
4792703	4800248	As a result, the Japanese market is flooded with a multitude of bad American titles mixed in with the games that the Japanese public should be buying.
4801168	4804611	Thoughts?
4805551	4806552	That's been happening for years.
4807012	4808894	I mean, it's just been going on.
4809454	4810875	They're relying on
4812426	4823754	You know, if it's from the fact from a corporate standpoint that they're saying business-wise there is this apathy and they are not taking any steps to change it, well, of course, it's going to stay the same.
4824274	4827777	They're going to have no incentive because based on numbers,
4829842	4835167	There hasn't been any past precedent to try to tailor the games to the Japanese market if they're not buying them anyway.
4835808	4842675	But I think that as typical with corporate America, they don't seem to realize the reason behind it.
4843095	4844116	All they see are their figures.
4845678	4846839	Good point.
4848440	4850642	Loki, anything you want to add?
4850682	4851223	We just have to...
4852793	4856557	Look at the movies and stuff they're coming out over here.
4856857	4861502	I mean, that's a perfect example of the difference between Japanese and American stuff.
4861542	4863905	You've got really crappy video game movies coming out.
4863965	4865987	I mean, and then look at Japanese market.
4866007	4868350	They have really kick-ass movies based on...
4868810	4870912	Anime series and games and whatnot.
4871893	4873835	But yeah, American movies do very well in Japan.
4873895	4875697	Isn't Titanic their highest grossing movie too?
4875897	4879180	Yeah, but the whole thing is though, let's look at some of these games that are coming out over here.
4879240	4881943	Okay, like Forza Motorsports or something like that.
4881963	4882924	A very American game.
4883364	4887068	Didn't do so well over in Japan because it, you know, or not Forza...
4888137	4888757	what am I thinking of?
4889397	4894399	Project Gotham 3 did really well over here, but not so well over there.
4894479	4898961	Ridge Racer kicked ass over there because Ridge Racer is just clearly a better game anyways.
4900262	4906304	Now, the whole thing is I think people it's like, ooh, graphics, they're so amazing.
4906344	4907404	The graphics are so amazing.
4907424	4908965	Yeah, but the game sucks.
4909125	4909905	That's the problem.
4912126	4917208	We need to focus more on gameplay over here in America, whereas right now we're focusing on
4917711	4921732	Who can, you know, make the coolest graphics and, you know, sound and stuff like that.
4921932	4924832	And we just completely lose sight on the game being good.
4925873	4927573	There's been some good games to come out of here, though.
4927613	4928213	Some excellent stuff.
4928233	4929073	World of Warcraft?
4929694	4930094	Halo?
4930514	4932854	Yeah, but those games are doing, you know, pretty well.
4934615	4935275	Grand Theft Auto?
4935795	4937275	I don't think that does well over there, does it?
4937295	4937815	I have no idea.
4937855	4938735	Well, no.
4939336	4939776	Probably not.
4940456	4940796	Interesting.
4941396	4943296	But they probably don't do much to localize it, really.
4943376	4945577	It's kind of a tough title to localize, wouldn't it be?
4946137	4946237	Hmm.
4947085	4952039	All right, I'm sure those of you guys in the chat room and who are listening to us on the podcast have plenty of feedback.
4952300	4952922	We'd love to hear it.
4952982	4954667	Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com or...
4955267	4957868	We should be opening up the Skype line in our next segment at some point.
4958208	4963470	And speaking of the next segment, I think it's time to take ourselves a little break and come back for the next segment.
4963510	4965631	So those of you guys listening live, we'll be back in a few minutes.
4965711	4972853	Those of you guys listening on the podcast stream, we'll be back in a couple of days with more of Orange Lounge Radio episode number 173.
4973713	4978695	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
