00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio. That's right, Rob

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,520
and Jamie are both still out. Jamie's actually feeling a bit under the weather right now

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,140
And her microphone is broken and Rob was trying to record a podcast on an iBook and well that didn't work out too much

4
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,800
You know so much for those Mac products. Anyways, I'm here to deliver another podcast for you guys

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,720
There's so much news. I couldn't possibly pass it up

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,200
Anyways, I'm gonna start things off like I started off every week with how my gaming week was once again

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,540
I've been playing full-auto all week long and I've gotten to the point now where I'm almost done with the game about

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,640
90% done and it's gotten goddamn frustrating. I have slammed controllers, cursed at my 360 and

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,280
literally almost broke the game in half. It's just really annoying, especially when you get to the part where the gang wars

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,760
and you have to work with some AI that's completely retarded and they want to end up blowing you up and you get penalized if

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,080
you blow them up. It's just really frustrating to get a gold in that, and I'm really trying

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,120
to do it, but I just have to really take breaks from it. I've been playing a little bit of

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,760
Hex HD a little bit, and it's an okay game. Tried a little bit of the Xbox Live Arcade

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,800
Gauntlet, and man do I suck at the original Gauntlet. Of course, been playing a little

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,380
bit of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and Deathmatches. Finally finished up February's

16
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,120
runnings and unfortunately I came in second this time around so

17
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,720
oh well better luck next month I guess. Alright let's start things off with

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,600
Microsoft's

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,820
origami project. This is a brand new

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,420
device put out by Microsoft. They've been teasing it a little bit here.

21
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,880
The full details are supposed to hit the internet

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,240
on March 2nd but right now they did have a teaser

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,320
kind of a concept video if you will showing off what this thing can do.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,760
It can basically play music, show some pictures, link up with the internet, has GPS, also a

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,140
media PC extender, Wi-Fi, touch screen, and of course they showed a little bit of gaming

26
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,140
going along with it.

27
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:37,780
So I'm thinking they're trying to use this as a PSP killer, possibly an iPod killer.

28
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,900
Just trying to combat all the portable gaming and media systems out there.

29
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,540
It should be interesting to see how this pans out.

30
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,620
It did look a little bit big, so I'm not really sure if they're going to be trying to pass

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,700
it off to the same market as maybe people that have iPods, but definitely a good alternative

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,920
to a laptop or a media PC or, I don't know, just something that you can take with you

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,740
on the go, browse your email and that type of thing.

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,460
So kind of interesting.

35
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,260
Now got a little bit of a scoop for you guys.

36
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:16,120
We have Activision's 2006 and 2007 line-up for their upcoming games, and it's actually

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,920
going to be something they're going to be debuting at the Destination PlayStation show.

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,660
Some of the notable features on here, we've got some of the movie expansions coming out.

39
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:37,200
Also Quake Enemy Territory coming out on the PC, of course that one looked really sweet.

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,480
Really interesting though is they do mention some of the lineup for the next-gen systems, which I thought was very interesting

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,460
including some of the revolution launch titles

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,880
Two of the revolution launch titles will be Tony Hawk

43
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,420
downhill Jam

44
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,320
Which is going to be the next in the Tony Hawk series and Marvel Legends no word on what Marvel Legends is going to be

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:06,340
But should be pretty interesting some of the other games coming out of course Call of Duty 3 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox

46
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,560
360, X3, you know, tying into the new X-Men movie, as well as some really interesting

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:20,600
titles including Pimp My Ride the game, and Koala's African Safari, as well as the History

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,720
Channel Civil War first person shooter game.

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,960
I don't know how that's going to work, but it should be interesting.

50
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,080
If you do happen to have, though, a PSP or a Nintendo DS, they haven't forgotten about

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,440
you either gun is coming to the PSP as well as Call of Duty 3 should be very

52
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,300
interesting or Call of Duty is gonna be heading to the PSP not sure if it's

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,600
gonna be Call of Duty 3 but probably a port of something or other also they

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,160
have over the hedge which is gonna be tying in with the Dreamworks movie and

55
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,560
pimp my right as well for that so interesting looks like the DS is also

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,040
getting spider-man kids I deal with that is but sounds pretty cool speaking of

57
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
the revolution though there's been some more titles announced for it as well one

58
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,680
of them being pennant chase pennant chase is actually a baseball game is

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,480
slated for August of last year and it's been pushed back and pushed back well

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,600
now they're talking that's gonna come out on the revolution whether it be a

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,600
launch title or not, should be interesting to find out. But, I don't know. Anyways, speaking

62
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,740
of the revolution, the cost of the revolution has definitely been one of the points for

63
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,140
that everyone's been looking at. They're debating whether it's going to be about $200 to $150

64
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,740
retail when it comes out. And a little bit of news that's actually going to back that

65
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,660
up. The software development kits have been priced and they're only going to be costing

66
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,480
developers $2,000. Now in comparison here, the PlayStation 2 software development kit

67
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,820
when it first came out was $20,000 per kit at launch. In fact, the original PlayStation

68
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,460
was only $4,000 to $5,000 at launch, so they're even cutting that in half. That's only backing

69
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,400
up the fact that they're trying to lower development costs and basically just lower the price of

70
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,460
games as we know them. So that's something to look forward to. Of course, more stuff

71
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,300
about the revolution is coming our way in E3 this year and one of the rumors

72
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,540
that we're going to see at E3 and I've been saying this before is going to be

73
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,260
some sort of virtual reality and well we've got some more hints at that. A

74
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:39,940
member of IGN's forums going by the name of Discreet here actually posted some

75
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,300
information about what's going to be coming out and the information that he

76
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,540
posted? Well, it was about this brand new 3D technology brought out by a company

77
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,200
called 3DH. And 3DH is basically a company that's developing holo

78
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,160
projection as well as the glasses to use this. And some of the pictures that they

79
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,120
show on the website look pretty sweet. So imagine using a 3D controller with this

80
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,880
holo projection system, possibly the glasses. You can see that, you know, the

81
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,740
Revolution is going to stand in a class all by itself so that's going to be

82
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,160
really sweet. Another title that's also rumored to be coming to the revolution

83
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,520
of course Nintendo's denying it would be Zelda. Zelda is actually the brand new

84
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,740
Twilight Princess it's been delayed until November now we all thought is

85
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,940
because of the launch and of course as I've been saying week after week is

86
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,300
because they're adding something special to it so this has been confirmed that

87
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,120
they're adding some added functionality to the GameCube title. Now, no word if it's actually

88
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,400
going to be on the revolution, but still the game is going to be launching with the revolution.

89
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Now on to another Nintendo platform here. We have Metroid Dread DS, a 2D Metroid sequel,

90
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,480
sequel rumored to be in the works for the new DS.

91
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:17,380
Fansite DSX is basically saying that the rumored non-3D sequel of the Metroid series is still

92
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,500
in the works, but still, you know, rumor right now, I don't know, it's still looking forward

93
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,260
to the brand new Metroid Prime Hunter, which is going to be coming out on the DS here in

94
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,600
March as well as, if you haven't played it yet, Metroid Prime Pinball, which I hear is

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,640
okay, but I don't know how well pinball games do on the DS.

96
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,400
In other news, The Legend of Zelda has reached its 20th anniversary.

97
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
That's right, 20 years of Link.

98
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,720
It's been one hell of an adventure ever since the 8-bit game came out on the Nintendo.

99
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
And now, of course, you know, with the news of Twilight Princess, it's only fitting that,

100
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,320
you know, we say happy birthday, Link. In other franchise news here, we've got a brand

101
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,060
new Mario game coming out, of course, on the Nintendo DS. That's right, the new Super Mario

102
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,300
Brothers has a street date now. May 7th right now is the tentative date for the new Super

103
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,420
Mario Brothers, and that's pretty sweet that it's going to be coming out here only a couple

104
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,460
days prior to E3, so it'll be worth checking that one out.

105
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,020
Another little thing here about the DS.

106
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,020
There's been a lot of rumors going around about a brand new revision to the DS, and

107
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,180
of course we're all familiar with the DS Lite, the brand new slimmed down DS with a brighter

108
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,740
screen.

109
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,980
There's still possible a third revision to the DS, and actually there is a patent discovered

110
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,780
this week that kind of backs that up.

111
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:54,280
The patent is for a brand new portable gaming system from Nintendo, and it actually shows

112
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,200
dual touch screens, not necessarily saying two screens that are touch screens, but actually

113
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,440
being able to point two positions simultaneously on the touch screen.

114
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,600
Now why is this important?

115
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,980
If you think about it, for example, one of the demonstration photos that they had on

116
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,120
there was like of a flight sim and you'd put your fingers on the tips of the wing

117
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,460
and basically be able to maneuver your plane through you know whatever

118
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:26,540
obstacles that you might encounter very similar to an Nintendo Revolution

119
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,020
controller think about that one for a little bit so that'd be interesting to

120
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,380
see if that ties in with the whole revolution system when that comes out

121
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,780
now if you can't wait that long for the third revision well you might as well

122
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,520
wait just a little bit longer for the second revision. That's right, the Nintendo DS Lite

123
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,920
is hitting the United States in May, so check that out. Might as well pick up your copy

124
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,100
of the new Super Mario Brothers game. And, of course, that's supposed to take over the

125
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,100
old DS by fall. They're going to be phasing out the original DS revision and, yeah, pretty

126
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,860
much DS Lite's going to take it over. Very similar to the way the Game Boy Advance SP

127
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,420
is taking over the Game Boy Advance, for all those who don't remember the old Game Boy

128
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:20,620
Advance. Speaking of portable system revisions, there's been some rumors about the PSP2. The

129
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:28,740
new PSP is rumored to feature an 8GB NAND flash hard drive. I guess this would be used

130
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,460
for more of the, you know, your portable media and MP3s and stuff, kind of as another iPod

131
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Anyways, that should be interesting. Another rumor going around about the PSP2 is that it will be containing a video camera, a new webcam.

132
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:55,460
And now this will be used actually as a mobile camera or possibly to put yourself in the game kind of like an itoy type of thing.

133
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,460
Map your photos onto your characters in the game.

134
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:15,460
Now currently the camera that we're talking about using for the PSP2 would be a Sony Ericsson mobile phone camera and basically it'll be placed on the PSP screen right about now where the PSP logo is currently found.

135
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Now I don't know if that's a good idea. Personally I would like to see it at the top of the system where you could rotate it around to possibly use this as, you know, say a digital camera.

136
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Because personally I could use a good digital camera.

137
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:38,460
Now to kind of back up the PSP camera rumor, there's actually been some ads spotted on London trains recently that kind of point towards possibly a camera coming out.

138
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:54,460
Now the advertisement shows basically a blank screen with the words View? No way! Delete View! Oh my god! Delete View! I don't remember taking that. Delete View at last! A decent one store here.

139
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,780
Now that sort of sounds like they're viewing digital photos, so kind of pointing towards

140
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,940
maybe that the camera is coming out.

141
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,260
Should be interesting, good addition to the PSP.

142
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,740
Speaking of cameras, the PSP isn't the only system to get a new camera.

143
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,700
It's actually been announced that the Xbox Live camera and microphone is going to be

144
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,840
released here pretty soon.

145
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,420
The camera is going to be able to shoot 640 by 480 video at 30 frames per second and take

146
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,260
1.3 megapixel still photos.

147
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,500
The camera will support built-in video chat and video messaging on Xbox Live, plus being

148
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,900
able to use it as sort of an iToy type of peripheral, being able to put yourself in

149
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,940
the games and that type of thing.

150
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,360
Still got one more peripheral for the Xbox 360 owners.

151
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,580
This one's going to be an Xbox 360 transfer kit from Datel.

152
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:52,060
The transfer kit's basically going to be just like the Exchange 360 site where you can transfer

153
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,340
your game saves from your Xbox 360 to your PSP. It's pretty interesting that they're

154
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,340
going to come out with something like this. The only problem, though, is you can only

155
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,140
dump the whole card at one time. It's expected to retail about $14.99.

156
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,080
On to a completely different topic. Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, is coming to American

157
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,240
Cell Phones. That's right, the popular DS title, which was a remake of the Japanese

158
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,740
Game Boy Advance title, Gaikuten Saiben, and the only one of the three-part series to get

159
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,220
the official US English translation, Gaikuten Saiben 2 and 3 are now being localized for

160
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:36,380
the US as downloadable content. In other news, some of your favorite old-time games from

161
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:42,000
Sierra are coming back. That's right, Sierra's classic adventure games are being re-released

162
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to run on the Windows XP. Everything from Space Quest to Police Quest to, of course,

163
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,660
Leisure Suit Larry. It should be very interesting to see those come out. They're going to be

164
00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:00,660
retailing at about $20 each, so look for those coming soon. Speaking of titles being re-released,

165
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,280
the Sonic 360 director has been hinting that Dreamcast titles could possibly make their

166
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:13,280
way onto Xbox Live's arcade. Masato Nakamura was asked if Sega had any plans to release

167
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,460
Sonic on the Xbox Live Arcade. He did reply, yes, we hope we can do something like it.

168
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,160
Was this a hint towards Dreamcast games being released on Xbox Live Arcade or possibly some

169
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,080
re-release of an old Sonic the Hedgehog game on the 15th anniversary of the series? We'll

170
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,360
Alright, for all you folks who are fans of the show, you'll know that my favorite topic

171
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,680
of discussion is the PSP homebrew scene, and we've got some good stories for you this week.

172
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,300
The first is going to be the brand new Super Nintendo emulator, SNES9X version 0.4 has

173
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,000
been updated, and this time the brand new feature is going to be wireless gameplay.

174
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,680
That's right, you can do multiplayer via Wi-Fi ad hoc, so it should be pretty cool.

175
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,480
One of the games that they've been able to run so far on it has been Street Fighter II

176
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,340
and it's been able to run at 60 frames per second while playing versus over Wi-Fi, so

177
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
that's amazing.

178
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,480
I can't wait to try that one out actually.

179
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,960
Another homebrew game that we've got coming out here is going to be Commander Keen.

180
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,200
That's right, everyone's favorite shareware game is back.

181
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,760
They've actually added emulation for all different firmwares so you'll be able to run this homebrew

182
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
on everything.

183
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,700
Right now you can download that on PSPupdates.com and you can check out, they've got the original

184
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,120
shareware episode included with that, so go check that out.

185
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,520
Now, if you're not a fan of Commander Keen, you may be a fan of Zork.

186
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,720
That's right, the Texas Adventure game has hit the PSP.

187
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,860
What's interesting about that is it's being run through a Game Boy emulator.

188
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Using Rin, the emulator for your PSP, you can actually run some of the Zork games, including Zork 1, 2, and 3.

189
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,860
You can find out more information on that, on PSP updates, of course, and check it out.

190
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:18,860
I believe you need Zork 1 for DOS, and then they basically walk you through on how they'll be able to run that as a Game Boy ROM, so check it out.

191
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,320
Alright, let's switch focus here and let's talk about a game system we're never going

192
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,980
to see and that would be Infinium Labs Phantom.

193
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:35,720
That's right, the Phantom, well, they're not doing very well actually.

194
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:43,660
Infinium Labs has actually run up a $62.7 million dollar bill.

195
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,420
Only $3.5 million of that has been to development costs.

196
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,020
The rest has been in salaries and marketing and just normal expenses.

197
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,620
Right now they're focused on getting the phantom lap board out and that's just a wireless keyboard

198
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,900
and mouse.

199
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
We're never going to see the system, folks.

200
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,300
It's just the way it is.

201
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,340
They're taking on so many losses right now.

202
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,980
By the time this thing ever gets to market, they're never going to make their money back.

203
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
It's just pitiful.

204
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,860
Now there's something a bit more controversial.

205
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,240
News station WGN has apparently stumbled onto video game addiction. They've actually run

206
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,360
a piece, Philadelphia's Channel 6, showing how video games could be like the next version

207
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,180
of crack, the way they basically have portrayed video games, showing how kids ignore their

208
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,680
families and ignore their dog. You know, who cares? Dogs don't need attention anyways,

209
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,960
especially when it comes down to video games. But the whole story is just a blatant ratings

210
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,600
ploy, basically. And huge backlash over that. Alright, so you've spent a lot of money, you've

211
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,400
got your brand new TV to go with that new snazzy next-gen system. Well, if you're thinking

212
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,400
about buying a Blu-ray or HD DVD video player, think again. Basically, 3 million HDTV owners

213
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,020
out there are going to be screwed. Why are you guys going to be screwed? Well, that's

214
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,180
because the brand new next-gen systems, or at least the video systems, are only going

215
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,180
to have HDMI or DVI connections. So your standard HDTV is not going to have that. Sorry, guess

216
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,200
you should have bought a more expensive TV. So, screw you Sony, and screw you Toshiba.

217
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,840
And since we're on the topic of screwing people, let's talk about screwing Electronic Arts.

218
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,960
That's right, if you haven't pre-ordered Black, then you probably didn't know that there was

219
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,160
actually a hidden code to get a brand new gun in the game. The big fucking gun as you

220
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,700
would put it. But guess what? A lot of people out there say who cares and they went ahead

221
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,080
and hacked the flash site and found the code for you. So get a pen and paper here. The

222
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:20,880
The code to get the BFG is 5SQQ-STHA-ZFFV-7XEV.

223
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,040
Have fun, enjoy the big fucking gun, and blow up a lot of people.

224
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,960
Alright, well that about does it, so I will see you guys later.

225
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,480
Enjoy this podcast, and we'll be back live again on March 5th.

226
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
