1
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:19,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio, that's right.

2
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:22,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob and Jamie are both still out.

3
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:27,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie's actually feeling a bit under the weather right now, and her microphone is broken.

4
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:33,536
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rob was trying to record a podcast on an iBook, and well, that didn't work out too much, you know.

5
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:36,056
[SPEAKER_00]: So much for those Mac products.

6
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:39,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I'm here to deliver another podcast for you guys.

7
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:42,778
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much news, I couldn't possibly pass it up.

8
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:48,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I'm going to start things off like I start off every week with how my gaming week was.

9
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:59,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I've been playing full auto all week long, and I've gotten to the point now where I'm almost done with the game, about 90% done, and it's gotten goddamn frustrating.

10
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:07,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I have slammed controllers, cursed at my 360, and literally almost broke the game in half.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,421
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really annoying, especially when you get to the part where the gang war's

12
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:19,621
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to work with some AI that's completely retarded and they want to end up blowing you up and you get penalized if you blow them up.

13
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:26,104
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really frustrating to get a gold in that and I'm really trying to do it but I just have to really take breaks from it.

14
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:30,285
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing a little bit of Hex HD a little bit and it's an okay game.

15
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:36,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried a little bit of the Xbox Live Arcade Gauntlet and man do I suck at the original gauntlet.

16
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:41,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, been playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and Deathmatches.

17
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:47,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally finished up February's runnings, and unfortunately I came in second this time around.

18
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, better luck next month, I guess.

19
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:55,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's start things off with Microsoft's Origami Project.

20
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:59,615
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brand new device put out by Microsoft.

21
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:01,296
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been teasing it a little bit here.

22
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:05,598
[SPEAKER_00]: The full details are supposed to hit the internet on March 2nd.

23
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:14,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now they did have a teaser, kind of a concept video if you will, showing off what this thing can do.

24
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:29,052
[SPEAKER_00]: It can basically play music, show some pictures, link up with the internet, has GPS, also a media PC extender, Wi-Fi, touchscreen, and of course they showed a little bit of gaming going along with it.

25
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:33,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking they're trying to use this as a PSP killer.

26
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:35,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly an iPod killer.

27
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:41,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to combat all the portable gaming and media systems out there.

28
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:44,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be interesting to see how this pans out.

29
00:02:44,525 --> 00:03:01,272
[SPEAKER_00]: It did look a little bit big, so I'm not really sure if they're going to be trying to pass it off to the same market as maybe people that have iPods, but definitely a good alternative to a laptop or a media PC or, I don't know, just something that you can take with you on the go, browse your email and that type of thing.

30
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:03,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So, kind of interesting.

31
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:07,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, got a little bit of a scoop for you guys.

32
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:15,336
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Activision's 2006 and 2007 lineup for their upcoming games.

33
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:20,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually going to be something that they're going to be debuting at the Destination PlayStation show.

34
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the notable features on here.

35
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:28,984
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some of the movie expansions coming out.

36
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:35,339
[SPEAKER_00]: also Quake Enemy Territory coming out on the PC of course that one looked really sweet

37
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:38,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony Hawk, Downhill Jam Marvel Legends

38
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:23,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other games coming out, of course, Call of Duty 3 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, X3, you know, tying in with the new X-Men movie, as well as some really interesting titles, including Pimp My Ride, the game, and Kabbalah's African Safari, as well as the History Channel Civil War first-person shooter game.

39
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that's going to work, but it should be interesting.

40
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,897
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do happen to have, though, a PSP or a Nintendo DS,

41
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:31,723
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't forgotten about you either.

42
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:38,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Gun is coming to the PSP, as well as Call of Duty 3 should be very interesting.

43
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Call of Duty is going to be heading to the PSP.

44
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:45,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if it's going to be Call of Duty 3, but probably a port of something or other.

45
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:51,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they have Over the Hedge, which is going to be tying in with the DreamWorks movie.

46
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pimp My Ride as well for that.

47
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:55,204
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

48
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:56,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

49
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:00,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like the DS is also getting Spider-Man Kids.

50
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what that is, but sounds pretty cool.

51
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:10,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of the revolution, though, there's been some more titles announced for it as well, one of them being Pennant Chase.

52
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:18,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennant Chase is actually a baseball game that was slated for August of last year, and it's been pushed back and pushed back.

53
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now they're talking that it's going to come out on the revolution.

54
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:28,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be a launch title or not should be interesting to find out, but I don't know.

55
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:37,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, speaking of the revolution, the cost of the revolution has definitely been one of the points that everyone's been looking at.

56
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:43,387
[SPEAKER_00]: They're debating whether it's going to be about $200 to $150 retail when it comes out.

57
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:46,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of news that's actually going to back that up.

58
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:52,272
[SPEAKER_00]: The software development kits have been priced, and they're only going to be costing developers $2,000.

59
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:53,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in comparison here,

60
00:05:55,404 --> 00:06:01,266
[SPEAKER_00]: The PlayStation 2 software development kit when it first came out was $20,000 per kit at launch.

61
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:05,247
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the original PlayStation was only $4,000 to $5,000 at launch.

62
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,047
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're even cutting that in half.

63
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:14,369
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only backing up the fact that they're trying to lower development costs and basically just lower the price of games as we know them.

64
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to look forward to.

65
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, more stuff about the revolution is coming our way in E3 this year.

66
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:29,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the rumors that we're going to see at E3, and I've been saying this before, is going to be some sort of virtual reality.

67
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:33,224
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, we've got some more hints at that.

68
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:43,610
[SPEAKER_00]: A member of IGN's forums, going by the name of Discrete here, actually posted some information about what's going to be coming out.

69
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:48,133
[SPEAKER_00]: And the information that he posted, well, it was about...

70
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:53,673
[SPEAKER_00]: This brand new 3D technology brought out by a company called 3DH.

71
00:06:54,453 --> 00:07:02,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And 3DH is basically a company that's developing hollow projection as well as the glasses to use this.

72
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:06,816
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the pictures that they show on the website look pretty sweet.

73
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:12,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine using a 3D controller with this hollow projection system, possibly the glasses.

74
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:17,579
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the revolution is going to stand in a class all by itself.

75
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be really sweet.

76
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:26,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Another title that's also rumored to be coming to the revolution, of course Nintendo's denying it, would be Zelda.

77
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:30,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Zelda is actually the brand new Twilight Princess.

78
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:32,645
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been delayed until November.

79
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we all thought it was because of the launch.

80
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:41,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as I've been saying week after week, it's because they're adding something special to it.

81
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:45,955
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been confirmed that they're adding some added functionality to

82
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:48,438
[SPEAKER_00]: GameCube title.

83
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:55,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, no word if it's actually going to be on the Revolution, but still a game that's going to be launching with the Revolution.

84
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on to another Nintendo platform here.

85
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:07,824
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Metroid Dread DS, a 2D Metroid sequel, rumored to be in the works for the new DS.

86
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:15,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Fansite DSX is basically saying that the rumored non-3D sequel

87
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:21,525
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Metroid series is still in the works, but still, you know, rumor right now.

88
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:22,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

89
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:36,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Still looking forward to the brand new Metroid Prime Hunter, which is going to be coming out on the DS here in March, as well as, if you haven't played it yet, Metroid Prime Pinball, which I hear is okay, but I don't know how well pinball games do on the DS.

90
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:43,156
[SPEAKER_00]: In other news, The Legend of Zelda has reached its 20th anniversary.

91
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,877
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, 20 years of Link.

92
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:46,979
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty sweet.

94
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:20,437
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be coming out here only a couple days prior to E3.

95
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be worth checking that one out.

96
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:26,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another little thing here about the DS.

97
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,862
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of rumors going around about a brand new revision to the DS.

98
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:37,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're all familiar with the DS Lite, the brand new slimmed down DS with a brighter screen.

99
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:46,214
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still possible a third revision to the DS, and actually there was a patent discovered this week that kind of backs that up.

100
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:55,563
[SPEAKER_00]: The patent is for a brand new portable gaming system from Nintendo, and it actually shows dual touch screens.

101
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:58,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not necessarily saying

102
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:06,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Two screens that are touchscreens, but actually being able to point two positions simultaneously on the touchscreen.

103
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is this important?

104
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:22,763
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, for example, one of the demonstration photos that they had on there was like of a flight sim, and you'd put your fingers on the tips of the wing and basically be able to maneuver your plane through whatever obstacles that you might encounter.

105
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:27,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar to a Nintendo Revolution controller.

106
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,086
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

107
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
[SPEAKER_00]: DS Lite Game Boy Advance

108
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:15,128
[SPEAKER_00]: PSP2, 8GB NAND Flash Hard Drive

109
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that should be interesting.

110
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:53,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Another rumor going around about the PSP2 is that it will be containing a video camera, a new webcam, and now this will be used actually as a mobile camera, or possibly to put yourself in the game, kind of like an

111
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:55,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony Ericsson Mobile Phone Camera

112
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:15,715
[SPEAKER_00]: will be placed on the PSP's screen right about now where the PSP logo is currently found.

113
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know if that's a good idea.

114
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:24,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I would like to see it at the top of the system where you could rotate it around to possibly use this as, say, a digital camera.

115
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Because personally, I could use a good digital camera.

116
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:38,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to kind of back up the PSP camera rumor, there's actually been some ads spotted on London trains recently that kind of point towards possibly a camera coming out.

117
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:48,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advertisement shows basically a blank screen with the words, View, no way, delete, view, oh my god, delete, view.

118
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,870
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember taking that.

119
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:53,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Delete, view, at last, a decent one store here.

120
00:12:54,434 --> 00:13:01,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that sort of sounds like they're viewing digital photos, so kind of pointing towards maybe that the camera is coming out.

121
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be interesting, good addition to the PSP.

122
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:06,617
[SPEAKER_00]: X-Box Live Camera and Microphone

123
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:23,811
[SPEAKER_00]: The camera is going to be able to shoot 640x480 video at 30 frames per second and take 1.3 megapixel still photos.

124
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:35,218
[SPEAKER_00]: The camera will support built-in video chat and video messaging on Xbox Live, plus being able to use it as sort of an iToy type of peripheral, being able to put yourself in the games and that type of thing.

125
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:38,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got one more peripheral for the Xbox 360 owners.

126
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:44,477
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's going to be an Xbox 360 transfer kit from Daytail.

127
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:55,807
[SPEAKER_00]: The transfer kit's basically going to be just like the Exchange 360 site, where you can transfer your game saves from your Xbox 360 to your PSP.

128
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:59,750
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty interesting that they're going to come out with something like this.

129
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,074
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem, though, is you can only dump the whole card at one time.

130
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:06,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expected to retail about $14.99.

131
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:09,442
[SPEAKER_00]: On to a completely different topic.

132
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, is coming to American cell phones.

133
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:23,872
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, the popular DS title, which was a remake of the Japanese Game Boy Advance title, Gaikuten Saiben, and the only one of the three-part series to get the official U.S.

134
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:25,913
[SPEAKER_00]: English translation.

135
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:29,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaikuten Saiben 2 and 3 are now being localized for the U.S.

136
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:31,497
[SPEAKER_00]: as downloadable content.

137
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:37,781
[SPEAKER_00]: In other news, some of your favorite old-time games from Sierra are coming back.

138
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,363
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Sierra's classic adventure games are being re-released to run on the Windows XP.

139
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:49,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from Space Quest to Police Quest to, of course, Leisure Suit Larry.

140
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:52,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be very interesting to see those come out.

141
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:57,910
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be retailing at about $20 each, so look for those coming soon.

142
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of titles being re-released,

143
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:08,474
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sonic 360 director has been hinting that Dreamcast titles could possibly make their way onto Xbox Live's arcade.

144
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:17,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Masato Nakamura was asked if Sega had any plans to release Sonic on the Xbox Live Arcade.

145
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:20,821
[SPEAKER_00]: He did reply, Yes, we hope we can do something like it.

146
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:25,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this a hint towards Dreamcast games being released on Xbox Live Arcade?

147
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:29,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Or possibly some re-release of an old Sonic the Hedgehog game?

148
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,361
[SPEAKER_00]: on the 15th anniversary of the series.

149
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:33,782
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to see.

150
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:43,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, for all you folks who are fans of the show, you'll know that my favorite topic of discussion is the PSP homebrew scene, and we've got some good stories for you this week.

151
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:46,870
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is going to be the brand new Super Nintendo emulator.

152
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:55,875
[SPEAKER_00]: SNES 9 version 0.4 has been updated, and this time the brand new feature is going to be wireless gameplay.

153
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:59,357
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, you can do multiplayer via Wi-Fi ad hoc.

154
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:01,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be pretty cool.

155
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:05,377
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the games that they've been able to run so far on it has been Street Fighter 2.

156
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:10,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been able to run at 60 frames per second while playing versus over Wi-Fi.

157
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's amazing.

158
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to try that one out, actually.

159
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:18,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Another homebrew game that we've got coming out here is going to be Commander Keen.

160
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,267
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, everyone's favorite shareware game is back.

161
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:25,329
[SPEAKER_00]: They've actually added emulation for all games.

162
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:26,449
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

163
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,716
[SPEAKER_00]: The emulator for your PSP.

164
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:03,700
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually run some of the Zork games, including Zork 1, 2, and 3.

165
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:09,704
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out more information on that on PSP Updates, of course, and check it out.

166
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:18,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you need Zork 1 for DOS, and then they basically walk you through on how to be able to run that as a Game Boy ROM, so check it out.

167
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's switch focus here and talk about...

168
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Game System, Infinium Labs, Phantom

169
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:53,418
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

170
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,284
[SPEAKER_00]: News station WGN has apparently stumbled onto video game addiction.

171
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:38,938
[SPEAKER_00]: They've actually run a piece, Philadelphia's Channel 6, showing how video games could be like the next version of crack, the way they basically have portrayed video games, showing how kids ignore their families and ignore their dog.

172
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,199
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who cares?

173
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:43,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs don't need attention anyways, especially when it comes down to video games.

174
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:49,390
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole story is just a blatant ratings ploy, basically.

175
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,531
[SPEAKER_00]: And huge backlash over that.

176
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:58,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so you've spent a lot of money, you've got your brand new TV to go with that new snazzy next-gen system.

177
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:07,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're thinking about buying a Blu-ray or HD DVD video player, think again.

178
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:09,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically...

179
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:14,178
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 million HDTV owners out there are going to be screwed.

180
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:15,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you guys going to be screwed?

181
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:25,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's because the brand new next-gen systems, or at least the video systems, are only going to have HDMI or DVI connections.

182
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:30,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So your standard HDTV is not going to have that.

183
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:34,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guess you should have bought a more expensive TV.

184
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So screw you, Sony, and screw you, Toshiba.

185
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:45,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're on the topic of screwing people, let's talk about screwing Electronic Arts.

186
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:55,217
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you haven't pre-ordered Black, then you probably didn't know that there was actually a hidden code to get a brand new gun in the game.

187
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,659
[SPEAKER_00]: The big fucking gun, as you would put it.

188
00:19:58,584 --> 00:19:59,064
[SPEAKER_00]: 5SQQ-STHA-ZFFV-7XEV

189
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:23,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun, enjoy the big fucking gun, and blow up a lot of people.

190
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well that about does it.

191
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will see you guys later.

192
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:32,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy this podcast, and we'll be back live again on March 5th.

193
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:33,983
