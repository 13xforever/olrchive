5212	12437	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
12837	14779	And now the conclusion of episode 174 from February 12, 2006.
19966	22348	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
22408	27071	It is February 12, 2006, and this is Part B, the second half of Episode 174.
27111	29413	Thank you guys so much for joining us.
31716	58583	Incentive for you guys to listen live on Sunday nights if you can, those of you guys out there I mean we podcast for a reason, we know not everybody can listen live Sunday nights But Sunday nights when we do do this live, we play music during the breaks when we do this show And tonight we played some pieces in that break from some classic Super Nintendo and Genesis titles We played a song from Secret of Mana in there, one of the songs from the beginning of the game And then we played the Emerald Hill Zone song from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 And the reason why I'm bringing this up
59326	62389	We can't play this stuff on the podcast because of copyright stuffs.
63130	66273	But I brought it up because it inspired some comments here in our chat room.
66493	68695	www.orangelontario.com, click on chat.
69416	73340	VXJasonXV, who also happens to be our lovely webmaster, he listens too.
73840	77584	He says, a lot of games just don't have memorable music like this anymore.
78124	79966	Catchy, but not memorable.
80987	81327	Agree?
81548	81988	Disagree?
82468	83269	Katamari.
84878	86339	There was also Space Channel 5.
86379	89201	Then again, the game was pretty much all music, wasn't it?
89221	89301	True.
101130	113252	But I mean, I understand what he's saying, is that with a lot of current titles, you either have licensed music, too, you play a game like Burnout, everything you're hearing is licensed, same stuff you hear on the radio, or, you know, it's not like the same it used to be.
113692	114012	I don't know.
114472	115713	I kind of see where he's coming from.
116113	117573	I kind of agree on that.
118373	120053	The same care isn't being put into it.
120734	120914	Yeah?
121834	128455	I think that when you have limiting circumstances, when you do something...
129580	137143	When you do something that excels, you know, under those limiting circumstances, people are going to recognize it.
137163	138764	They're going to see the effort that went into it.
139304	143286	Nowadays, you can make something that sounds really good with minimal effort.
144326	144586	True.
144667	147648	So maybe it's harder to stand out above the pack in that case?
148048	148628	I really think so.
150049	152030	Well, anyway, just a little side topic.
152090	152990	I just thought that was interesting.
153170	155351	I love when our chat room inspires conversation here.
155371	156412	See, we're an interactive show.
156692	157392	Truly interactive.
157905	159026	www.orangeonstradio.com
182022	182482	Exactly.
182642	186404	There was a profanity study done this week for Halo 2.
186944	188945	And I love the way that they intro this.
189025	191126	What exactly is a profanity study?
191686	195488	It's studying the frequency of profanity in Halo 2 during online games.
196428	199189	Anyways, I love the way they intro this.
199269	206612	It's basically, when you log into Xbox Live, more often than not, you're greeted by a 14-year-old that learned a new word on the playground that day.
208573	208873	It's great.
209373	209654	But anyways...
211187	217430	This study, here's what they've basically come up with over the course of 33.9 hours.
219291	230217	Anyways, the number one word, of course, that appeared would have been fuck, with 43% of the time, with an average of 8.11 uses per hour.
235160	237903	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
254682	257985	of course some of the other colorful language that was in there.
258305	267513	9% of them were racial slurs, 7% of them were sexual slurs including, you know, I want to fuck your mom, that type of stuff.
269014	276621	Wait a minute, does I want to fuck your mom count as the usage of the word fuck or as sexual usage of the word fuck?
277054	281281	Well, basically, sexual phrases which were not homosexual.
281321	286089	Fuck was not included in this unless it was directed at a person, i.e.
286129	286570	your mom.
287051	288293	So, how...
288655	290376	How many times did Frack appear?
290416	291236	That's what I want to know.
291256	291596	I don't know.
291616	292636	That's how they do it on TV.
293337	295437	7% of them were homosexual references.
295477	299679	In other words, you're gay, you suck, you homo.
300739	310722	Damn appeared 3% of the time, bitch 7% of the time, and ass 5% of the time, you know, being asshole, assbag, asshat, etc.
314676	318282	and actually... I know why you wanted to do this story tonight.
318362	323610	You just wanted an excuse to say ass bag and sound professional.
324383	325444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
349225	352549	Game experiences may differ during online play.
352950	354672	That, I guess, does make sense now.
355012	356073	I prefer Oh Poopy.
356914	361420	Well, thank you very much, Loki, for earning this episode an explicit tag.
361540	362101	Good job!
362161	362241	Woo!
367298	369519	I'm gonna pwn you, you fucking noobs.
369899	374541	Remind me, before you say all these words again, what was the point of this study?
375041	377082	Scats whores or what?
377843	380284	I'm curious how many times people really do say fuck.
380784	383385	It was basically that they're trying to kind of...
385669	392493	I guess bring this to light, you know, all these stupid people that are on Xbox Live and stuff and kind of that, you know, maybe that they should.
393994	398637	This isn't exactly a plea, you know, for the government to crack down or tighten the control in the gaming industry.
398697	402499	It's just basically information that parents can educate themselves with.
402519	408582	That this is how much, you know, fucking language they're going to hear during the course of Halo 2.
409383	409723	Interesting.
409743	412425	Which is why Halo 2 is the number one Xbox Live game.
412465	413845	How much more do they hear in their house?
414806	414826	I,
416395	418136	I like this tweak in our chatroom.
418156	420176	It says, Asshat is my Xbox's name.
423617	424937	Well, good for you, buddy.
424977	429058	Dan's Halo team was called Badass Ninjas, but it was AZZ.
430338	430779	Interesting.
431879	432639	Let's see here.
434980	435900	I don't know.
435980	436840	Anyway, fine.
436980	437580	Great study.
437680	438560	Hooray, hooray.
438620	442241	Let's go to a more serious Halo 2 related article, shall we?
442601	444802	Jamie, for the love of God, please save us.
446426	448227	Try not to use ass bag in your story.
449307	452748	Well, about Ass 2 on PC.
452908	453329	Stop it.
453529	455289	Okay, Halo 2 on PC.
455669	470955	According to Xbox.com, the Xbox game Halo 2 is being put on PC, but there's a hitch on that one that it's not for Windows XP, but for Windows Vista.
472930	479272	So you'll be able to do playing on that one next month, I suppose.
479332	482072	In other words, buy Windows Vista, please.
482772	484533	Here's an excuse to upgrade to Windows Vista.
485053	490174	So you can freaking play Halo 2, which really would be better if you had an Xbox anyway.
490694	495356	Being half the computers right now anyways can't run Windows Vista's default theme.
497196	497596	Sad.
497996	498516	Sad!
499577	501117	Microsoft is not learning anything!
502421	504062	You know where our chat room's going with this now?
505022	509623	I'm back on the swearing thing, but this is a good indication by our chat room here.
510304	513725	They're bringing up... Have you guys ever seen that video on the internet of the kid?
513785	515446	And I don't know if it was staged or not.
515486	516686	People say it's legit, but whatever.
517066	522548	Some kid is playing on Xbox Live and he left his voice chat on or whatever, and you can hear him yelling at his mom.
522888	525088	and people are quoting it in our chat room right now.
526349	526689	Let's see.
526709	531990	It looks like SSJ100 to Matt and Fireboma are going back a little bit back and forth in the chat room there.
532250	533930	Mom, I want my fucking chocolate milk.
533970	535190	You promised me, you bitch.
535230	536271	I'm in a clam match.
536311	539591	You said I could get whatever I wanted and I said chocolate milk but now I want Mountain Dew.
540011	540851	Have you ever heard that?
541472	542112	Oh my gosh.
542172	544592	It's so sad.
544712	545992	I don't know how else to describe it.
546012	547973	I've heard children talking to their parents this way though.
547993	548933	That's crazy.
549747	553229	Anyway, I just had to bring that because it made me think of that and those guys are on it too.
553329	558852	Anyway, let's talk about something pure and wholesome and good in the world like Oprah.
560412	566155	Okay, maybe that's a controversial subject and you're probably wondering what in the hell does Oprah have to do with gaming?
566455	568656	Is she going to have video games on her show?
569077	573919	No, not yet, but who knows because Nintendo has their sights on Oprah.
575293	579401	This was Reggie Fils-Aim speaking at DICE.
579922	586356	He said that Nintendo is considering using new marketing outlets such as Oprah and Ellen.
587119	593304	He said a, quote, blue ocean of opportunity through new types of gameplay, end quote.
593704	600789	So, obviously, Nintendo's trying to attract a whole new set of gamers here, and I think we've kind of seen this in the early releases for the Revolution.
600829	605092	I seem to remember them saying, well, this controller looks like a TV remote.
605313	612438	Everybody's used a TV remote, so we're trying to expand to a whole new base of gamers, and you can see that Nintendo is being very aggressive with this stuff.
613198	616421	Also, he went on to point out that Nintendogs was a great success.
616901	620364	Brain Training in Japan sold 2.5 million.
621385	626608	By the way, Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day is coming out here on April 17th.
626648	629310	I'm very interested to check this out.
631992	638157	Very interesting there on how Nintendo's being aggressive there with their marketing.
639998	644742	They feel, I guess, not enough moms are playing the Nintendo systems.
645062	645723	I suppose not.
646992	647533	All right.
648073	648713	That'd be great.
648793	653497	Mom, why are you ponying noobs on, you know, Smash Brothers Revolution?
655198	655538	All right.
656659	658100	Jamie, what do you have for us next?
661022	662103	Did you know that games are like porn?
664352	679640	I don't know what games you play, but... I know you said you and Dan kind of have some fond memories over games, but I hope this isn't the kind of thing where... More like me screaming at him for being a... Okay, every time that we play, like, Street Fighter and he wins, he has to talk shit, you know?
680081	681241	Like, oh, I won!
681621	682262	Oh, you suck!
682322	684443	But I'm like, I'm not gonna play with you again then.
685644	688365	I'd be... You know, if it were me, I'd be all, I am putting out tonight.
688485	691107	I'd be like, bitch, you watch out, I'll use Cammy.
691807	692187	Alright.
692267	693528	He hates when I use Cammy, by the way.
693588	693648	No.
693985	695526	because I own him every time.
695766	696806	Okay, no, I did not know.
697366	698307	I'm sorry, let me take your bait.
698647	700868	No, Jamie, I didn't know that games are like porn.
700908	701608	What do you mean?
703589	711873	Well, there's been a bit of a talk going around about how games are being marketed.
714774	719736	But there's been this obsession going around with basically making them all cinematic.
720256	722437	That game pitches are being done like
723641	725903	It's like this movie, or it's like this movie.
726603	733528	And then, you know, they've got to go out and use different media to market the games.
733548	739972	You know, you sit and watch, you'd be watching a movie trailer at the theater, and you get a game thing up there.
740613	741834	Like, I'm not watching a movie.
742494	743915	I'm watching a video game ad.
744575	744816	You know.
746677	752841	There's actually a quote out here by, is his last name pronounced?
753427	758654	J for Joff, David Joff, who was the creator of God of War.
759698	773140	But he's basically putting down the video game industry to imitate Hollywood movies and not offer the decent wages that you find amongst the Hollywood industry because the games are being marketed just the same way.
773520	781822	So are they saying, they're not saying games are like porn, take that literally, but they're saying games is like how porn is viewed in the entertainment industry.
781882	782742	Is that what I'm reading?
782762	783022	Okay.
783582	783902	Interesting.
784022	784222	Good.
784322	788583	I was kind of wondering if this was going back to the Rez and Transvibrator thing again.
788883	790824	No, but I have a story on that coming up later.
791084	791464	Awesome.
792384	793365	I love this quote here.
793385	797427	He's referring to the tie-in with Peter Jackson's King Kong.
798307	798927	This is a quote.
799467	804710	A lot of reviews praise King Kong's lack of HUD, but what's wrong with an HUD?
805070	809752	What's wrong with a health bar that raises good to the player when he replenishes it?
810052	815214	And why are we applauding in the press for abandoning the native language of video games?
816454	817355	There's also another quote in here.
817375	817435	I'm
818553	824298	about the obsession with cinema, and he admitted, I am guilty of that as well because God of War was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark.
824699	831705	However, he explained he wanted the game to give players the experience of watching Indiana Jones as a 10-year-old rather than being Indiana Jones themselves.
833246	836149	Now, this is where the porn industry ties in another quote.
836609	838090	It's like the porn industry, sort of.
838491	842474	I read about this guy who had this topless review that he was trying to add art to, and it's bombing.
842814	844336	Maybe games fall into that slot.
844736	847897	Some days I think games can be something else, the next great entertainment media.
848297	853018	And then days I feel like it's just like porn or motion rides where there's no capability to reach high emotional levels.
854358	854898	Wow.
855679	857479	That's a very interesting quote.
858539	860740	I don't have an immediate reaction to that.
860840	862860	I'm going to sit on that one and think about it for a little bit there.
862900	863120	Games.
863441	868462	So that's how games are like porn is that when you try to be artsy with porn, people don't buy into it.
869322	869482	Hmm.
871952	875459	You have to wonder what would happen if we had more people with creative sensibilities.
875880	879106	If more games had a soul, had something to say, something that resonates.
879867	888869	He also was resentful over the fact that people that create games receive pretty meager wages compared to how Hollywood directors and screenplays receive.
889469	892470	He said, I'm really frustrated with the way the industry is structured.
892510	894790	There is a sense of kind of being exploited.
895290	896490	It's an industry problem.
896911	899531	But he has, of course, no intention to leave the industry.
899571	908073	He said, if Sony came to me and told me, we're making God of War 2, I might have to decline, he said before admitting, I can stand up here and say I won't do it until they kick me out.
908113	908853	I'm not going anywhere.
912041	940904	but you know but I you know my whole thing with that is you know like I said earlier not only is it that we're seeing the same type of standard in video games that's expected you know if movies we're seeing them marketed the same way too you know right up along there with your feature flick you've got the game to go with it you have other games being marketed in the same genre why aren't they getting the same type of of you know pay that anyone in the cinematic industry would receive hmm
941897	942437	Interesting.
942718	945519	I don't have an easy answer for that right now.
945599	946920	It gives us something to think about, though.
947020	948742	I'm curious what the chatroom thinks about that.
949302	950703	OrangeLogicRadio.com, click on chat.
950743	952244	Maybe we'll get some Skype calls about that later.
952424	952724	I don't know.
953725	954425	Thank you for that story.
954445	954946	That was a good one.
956046	957767	All right, let's move on and talk about Sony.
958248	965493	In Part A tonight, we talked a lot about the DS and Xbox and stuff, but we didn't talk a whole lot about Sony, so Loki, save the day here.
965553	966433	Give us some Sony news.
967234	967314	Okay.
967334	967554	Okay.
968010	972318	Basically, one of the first things we have is, could the PlayStation 3 kill Sony?
972338	977126	Because if you think about it, this thing is taking forever to come out, so you kind of have to look at it a little bit.
977887	979931	One of the things that's being brought up is...
980444	980704	DarkSakura,
1003673	1007397	They're saying, oh, it might be $400, could be $500.
1007497	1012241	I mean, people don't have that kind of money to drop on these console systems like that.
1012581	1024812	Plus, with Blu-ray coming out and stuff, not many people feel the need that they need Blu-ray because you're not going to see a big difference unless you own a high-def TV, and only 24% of the market out there owns a high-def TV.
1024892	1026594	So, who cares?
1027074	1029917	I think that number is going to increase, though, certainly throughout the next few years.
1029937	1030738	Oh, yeah, it will, but...
1032202	1032582	I agree.
1032622	1036623	Sony needs to drop the price hint already so people stop theorizing about this.
1037384	1043425	Game Developers Conference would be a good time to do that hint hint, but we all know we're going to be waiting until E3 to see the real meat of this.
1043625	1050227	The other thing is, and I think this is probably going to change right now, that we haven't really seen much in games right now.
1050327	1052028	Nothing's really been finished.
1052968	1055889	Right now, I think the whole point is everyone's starting to kind of...
1058137	1058737	All Doom and Gloom
1081758	1082999	Is that a crazy price point?
1083259	1084580	It is a crazy price point.
1084620	1086862	I think so too, but I'm just saying people will pay it.
1087442	1088203	Yeah, people will pay it.
1088463	1089324	That's over retail.
1089364	1092206	What are they going to be charging for these if there's a shortage?
1092326	1092686	Oh, $2,000.
1093246	1093707	There you go.
1094788	1096449	But I don't know.
1097329	1100252	I think that they need to come out with some information, that's for sure.
1101513	1102113	The sooner the better.
1102642	1105986	Well, is it possible there might be any shows coming up where we could see some of this information?
1106306	1107207	There is actually.
1107928	1112033	At the TGS show, not the Tokyo Game Show, but the...
1112908	1114568	Taipei Game Show 2006.
1115168	1124010	Sony will be showcasing their next-gen console featuring numerous booths, 80 booths actually, covering all the games.
1125170	1126991	They're going to be coming out.
1127071	1128871	And 20 of them exclusively for the PS3.
1129471	1132112	I think it's just going to be recycled stuff.
1134372	1136212	Why would they announce something new at this show?
1136332	1140073	No, the new thing added is going to be the Boomerang competition using the controller.
1140413	1143175	Boomerang controller has been redesigned, actually.
1144296	1157566	There was an article put out by, I believe there was some gaming group that got to test out the PS3 and three of the games that have been made so far on the dev console, obviously, and the controller being used does not look like a boomerang.
1158266	1159007	Interesting, okay.
1159397	1161898	They're basing it more around the DualShock type of thing.
1162278	1162678	Good, good.
1162698	1164559	Because DualShock, if it ain't broke, why fix it?
1164699	1166919	Well, it could be an ergonomic DualShock.
1167259	1170941	Obviously, the Boomerang of Death is probably not going to be the controller.
1172781	1173021	Alright.
1173341	1180503	And even if it was the Boomerang of Death that was the controller, third-party people are going to make a DualShock-looking one anyway, so you can always buy that.
1180724	1185425	About prices, Sephiroth1215 in our chat, remember back when PS1 was like $500?
1186585	1188666	People paid that when that first came out.
1190210	1192892	It would be insanely stupid for the PS3 to be $700.
1194573	1196054	It's murder for their system right there.
1196554	1196994	Yeah.
1199396	1199656	Alright.
1201638	1207201	Okay, we'll go ahead and move on here, get into another story, and actually it kind of relates to the PlayStation 3.
1207522	1209243	It's just a real brief thing I have here.
1210123	1218068	Activision has revealed that they will be releasing three titles at launch for the Sony console, and of course one game for the Revolution as well.
1219008	1222290	As far as what games those are, well, that we don't know.
1222710	1224891	For whatever reason, those are being kept well under wraps.
1225012	1228934	I would say everybody's holding on to it so they can blow their load at E3.
1229805	1232707	I think E3 is going to be an avalanche of information.
1233328	1239272	You know if it's not that it's going to be murder for the publicity of these systems.
1239592	1248558	I mean, there's so much hype around this year's E3 with these two systems, Revolution and PS3, that both companies better be prepared to lay it all out on the table, I think.
1250659	1258425	It's interesting because the article on this site that this ran on here, gamersreports.com, where we found this, says you can guarantee that one of these...
1259898	1262019	One of these games will be Tony Hawk something.
1262619	1264379	And certainly that would make sense.
1265179	1268040	A new Tony Hawk game on PS3 at launch.
1268700	1269740	Successful series, why not?
1270020	1270400	Good theory.
1271861	1272361	Alrighty.
1273781	1275802	What else might the PS3 bring us, Loki?
1276802	1278582	Hopefully lots of violent games.
1278882	1284904	I know Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to be for the PS3, but one of the things that we've been actually seeing, there was a...
1287373	1301656	British, or yesterday, actually at the British Embassy in Tokyo, there was a seminar on British gaming and demonstrated how the powerful graphics of the PS3 can display lots of violence.
1302176	1302596	Oh yes.
1303416	1310738	From headshots to body shots, they had basically, this developer, it's
1312571	1313812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1335171	1341393	This is a duh for me because as graphics get better, so will the detail of violence.
1341433	1342854	And you know what else is going to get better?
1343434	1345835	The tits and ass will be more realistic as well.
1346755	1347115	Duh.
1350117	1351037	Sorry, but, you know.
1352818	1353938	They need to come out with a game.
1354018	1354718	Tits and ass.
1355359	1355899	Headshot.
1356059	1357279	That's the selling point.
1357299	1358520	The tits and ass headshot game?
1358920	1359260	Hell yeah.
1361260	1362922	Coming to PS3 exclusively.
1363142	1366125	Maybe that'll be DOA Beach Volleyball 2 at 360.
1366425	1366726	We'll see.
1368167	1368768	Moving on.
1369829	1374634	I know that if the PS3 does usher in a lot of violent games, you know who's gonna love this?
1374994	1376636	You know who's gonna love that?
1377397	1377537	Me?
1378258	1379499	Well, not just you, but...
1380765	1382425	Jacky Poo Jacky Poo
1411803	1412444	Robano?
1412584	1412884	Yeah.
1412964	1413264	Why?
1413284	1414965	What's the difference between two games?
1415086	1416266	You do know we're a video game show, right?
1416627	1419129	Because he's one of Elevation's key investors.
1420109	1420830	Elevation partners.
1420850	1421590	Oh.
1421610	1423312	Because they're trying to obtain Take-Two.
1424537	1429780	Oh, okay, so Jack Thompson hates Take-Two, Bono wants to buy something he's got to do.
1430020	1430660	Okay, okay.
1430840	1431901	So what do you say in the letter, do we know?
1432401	1444006	Dear Bono, the letter begins, I write you as a fellow brother in Jesus Christ, appreciative of your bold witness to the transforming truth of the gospel in both your words and your deeds.
1444606	1450349	I write to encourage you respectfully and in the spirit of brotherly love not to purchase Take-Two Interactive Software Incorporated.
1450409	1451289	Alright, my brain is burning.
1451769	1453270	It's because you're going to hell.
1454721	1456002	That's okay, we all got our spot reserved.
1456022	1459546	I think you should have wrote Bono and went, you know, in the name of love.
1461348	1462049	Don't forget it.
1463490	1466834	You know what, the whole terminology there, I admit...
1468876	1487321	I think that it's just a very poorly masked attempt to, besides the get publicity thing, to try to use religion as a front for his own personal agenda, which I find horribly insulting.
1490221	1493182	And if you're a religious person, you should probably find this insulting too, I think.
1494212	1510200	Well, he's also said in the letter that Take-Two has lied to the investment community in its latest SEC filing and warns that ongoing criminal investigations have put the publisher's very survival at risk, despite the fraudulent assertions in the recent SEC filing that they are all without merit.
1512842	1513162	You know...
1514958	1515659	In other words, Jackie Poo?
1515679	1515939	Shut up!
1515979	1516280	Sit down.
1516300	1516600	Shut up.
1537319	1540802	He needs to just cry me a river, build a bridge, and get over it.
1542363	1545125	Loki, did he ever get our flowers?
1545605	1550549	I know they weren't our flowers, but we helped, and our name was on the little signature of the letter.
1550669	1551089	Yes, it was.
1551109	1552170	The host of Orange Lounge Radio.
1552591	1554112	Did he ever get those flowers?
1554232	1564780	Yes, he did, and he forwarded them on to the offices of Rockstar, and I believe the attorneys representing Rockstar.
1564900	1566421	I'll bet he never even looked at them.
1567830	1569992	Yeah, he even took a minute to smell the flowers.
1570032	1570933	He said they were pretty.
1571393	1571653	Did he?
1572214	1572654	Well, that's good.
1572674	1573315	He said they were pretty.
1573355	1573775	That's good.
1574495	1576237	And he basically called it harassment.
1577867	1595295	You know, it says this harassment of me follows take two and blank Rome's lead in characterizing me in the media and in Alabama's courthouse as variously a bisexual pedophile, mentally ill, paranoid, and so forth.
1595755	1597516	Yeah, because I believe that's what the letter said at all.
1599125	1601206	Anyways, what a dumbass.
1601687	1603648	How is sending flowers harassment?
1604729	1607811	Ordering pizza to somebody else, that's harassment.
1607971	1608811	That's not what happened here.
1608871	1619358	The whole point of this thing was to do something that was non-harassing because there are a lot of people that have chosen to respond immaturely to Jack Thompson.
1619659	1621640	And this was supposed to be the anti-harassment.
1622389	1624851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1645908	1646068	Right.
1646488	1661239	He said that the flowers were sent to harass him and he sent them, you know, to them to basically, they're forwarded in a memory of the innocence that each of you three men helped kill, as Jack Thompson put.
1661679	1663680	Whatever.
1664361	1675028	It's forwarded in the memory of these victims whose killers have yet... I want to know how many people he thinks have actually been killed by Grand Theft Auto and how many of these people actually, you know,
1675918	1685385	If there's like three people they're talking about here, and how many millions of people have played this game, I would say that's a pretty small number.
1685805	1693811	If everybody was learning to kill from these games, wouldn't there be millions and millions of killers out there?
1694775	1696276	I can't send him a puppy.
1696376	1697436	Ross makes a good point.
1697616	1702957	But I can't send him a puppy because the moment the puppy tried to bite him, he'd have the puppy locked up and then put to death.
1703097	1703817	Poor puppy.
1703957	1704297	I know.
1704357	1705278	We don't send him any puppies.
1707018	1708198	I really don't want to talk about Jackie Poo.
1708218	1708658	All right, fine.
1708778	1709559	I really do.
1709979	1714000	I'm actually seriously thinking about and compiling the statistical data myself and writing him a letter.
1714300	1714640	Sweet.
1715340	1718441	Because you know when I write a letter to anybody...
1719581	1723004	I put statistical data to back up every damn thing I say.
1723204	1729389	Well, I'm curious now with this whole activism thing, what's next for the Flowers for Jack folks?
1729489	1731751	I mean, they created a huge thing here.
1731791	1735634	Well, they've been arguing back and forth with Jack Thompson over email.
1735674	1738736	It looks like it says, get over your Jack Thompson obsession.
1738776	1739717	This is not about me.
1739757	1742699	It's about Rockstar's sale of murder simulators to children.
1744701	1746262	Maybe you should encourage the parents to do their job.
1746656	1752398	I hope to God that the next Grand Theft Auto game that comes out is Grand Theft Auto Murder Simulator for Children.
1752698	1754559	Alright, what's the website?
1754579	1758260	Didn't the Flourish for Jack folks get so big they had to make their own new website?
1758380	1765642	I believe it's PixellantiNation.com And of course Pixellanti was a term that Jackie Poo coined.
1765922	1766862	So, cute.
1767463	1771744	Alright, so keep tabs on that and we'll be keeping an eye on it too to see what they do next.
1771844	1774925	As much as we'd like not to talk about them each week, you know.
1775356	1776796	F you of the week time, DarkSakura.
1798348	1808894	My FU of the week goes to San Francisco traffic for sucking out the soul that was sitting within me happily after leaving the Kintetsu Mall.
1810195	1818900	Yesterday I went with my friend Becky to the Rosicrucian Museum in San Jose to go look at the Egyptian exhibit.
1819221	1823543	And then we went on to San Francisco to go shopping and look for Japanese stuff.
1824304	1827466	And after we were done with the shopping, we decided we were going to go...
1828444	1829925	to find somewhere to eat and I got lost.
1830525	1831485	Well, I didn't really get lost.
1831545	1840489	It was more just the streets there make no sense because you'd be going down the road and all of a sudden, oh, we're going to split off here and not make any type of real sense in how we go.
1840869	1847712	So finally got to turn around and got back up and made my way back to Mission, which I knew would lead me to Van Ness.
1848313	1854595	And we were going up Van Ness going, you know what, let's eat at the Hard Rock Cafe because as far as she remembered it was on Van Ness.
1855196	1855636	It wasn't.
1856297	1858339	So we're like, oh crap, we don't see it anywhere.
1858819	1867205	So we headed back to go to the fisherman's wharf.
1867225	1868886	We were going to try to eat at Bubba Gump.
1868906	1870788	So there's a two and a half hour wait.
1871128	1871408	Yep.
1872009	1872349	I know.
1872769	1874371	And then we found the Hard Rock Cafe had been moved there.
1875231	1876132	So we're like, great.
1876512	1880355	So after us saying out of spite we were not going to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe, we ate there anyway.
1881156	1881796	It was really good.
1882797	1882917	And...
1883858	1893083	I know what you're talking about.
1893543	1893884	Yes.
1894204	1894664	Alright.
1895665	1896725	Alright, moving on.
1897285	1898566	Uh, Loki.
1899567	1900107	I got nothing.
1900187	1902608	I'm not really pissed off at anything, actually.
1903008	1904009	What if I threw a book at your head?
1904029	1905590	What if I give you something to be pissed off about?
1905970	1906330	Okay.
1907311	1908471	Somebody step on Loki's foot.
1909992	1910252	Fine.
1910272	1910613	You stay.
1910633	1910813	Bye.
1911900	1912340	TheFerretHasNephew
1928846	1932409	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm not going to be here for two weeks.
1932529	1933911	That kind of stinks.
1934251	1942558	You know, I mean, it's for my day job, and I like my day job and all, and getting out of town once in a while on the company dollars is cool and all, and, you know, I get to go teach, which is what I love to do.
1943018	1947803	But it still sucks because, you know, I have to put other stuff I like to do, such as this, on hold.
1947883	1948924	So that bites.
1949364	1953187	So an FU to that frustration feeling that comes with that.
1953708	1953888	Grr.
1955359	1958240	and an F you to the fact that I probably won't really get to play games while I'm out there.
1958260	1959520	I'm going to fall behind on this gaming stuff.
1959540	1965802	I'll be able to read websites and stuff, but my laptop that I'm taking is not that hot unless I convince Extrovert to let me borrow his.
1966643	1968503	And, you know, I won't get to play World of Warcraft.
1968543	1972004	I won't get to play Xbox or PlayStation or any of that stuff.
1972024	1976026	I mean, I could always rent the... Jamie's cradling her laptop.
1976086	1980167	No, I know you won't give up the precious, but I could always rent
1980512	1982393	Nintendo 64 games in the hotel room.
1982413	1983854	The last hotel I stayed at.
1984054	1985835	The last Hilton I stayed at had that.
1985855	1987036	You should take your PSP.
1987216	1988156	I might.
1989317	1990477	I'll probably take the DS.
1990718	1991238	Take the DS.
1991278	1991658	I probably will.
1991878	1994640	You know, I originally... You can chat with us on Animal Crossing.
1996140	1996441	Yeah.
1996961	1999702	I'm trying to think if there's any really good games coming out for the DS or Nintendo.
1999722	2000943	But anyway, I'll probably take that stuff.
2001043	2001964	Jackie can stalk around.
2001984	2002604	We'll see ya.
2002624	2006186	They do have free Wi-Fi, so maybe I'll actually get back into Animal Crossing.
2006606	2006806	Anyway.
2008087	2008307	Anyway.
2009784	2011066	Let's get back to the show.
2011146	2012488	I feel better now that I've vented.
2012528	2013970	I paid off my last loan, by the way.
2014751	2017355	Not my very last loan, but I've got my second room now.
2018156	2019137	My second downstairs room.
2019157	2019898	Yep, me too.
2019918	2020839	845,000 bells!
2020860	2021901	That's a lot of fish.
2024767	2026028	Oh no, I've been using fruit.
2027830	2029231	And selling furniture.
2046684	2058168	Tekken is coming to the PSP, so that'd be great, except we don't know if it's going to be a new Tekken fighting game, which it probably will be, or something crappy like Death by Degrees, you know.
2058688	2060809	So anyways, I'm looking forward to that.
2061349	2068551	Another thing, if you missed out on Nintendogs, you might get your chance with The Dog Happy Life.
2069191	2073453	It's actually a Nintendog-like game, and you can...
2074797	2078540	Customize your dog's room, and so on and so forth.
2078600	2079360	Teach it stuff.
2080561	2081442	So that'd be pretty cool.
2081542	2093330	And actually, it'd be interesting, I'm not sure if they have this, but since they do have the mic, which you can use for the PSP, maybe you can actually train your dog via voice.
2093430	2095631	So have voice recognition or something.
2095651	2096472	That'd be pretty cool.
2096752	2099454	No word on that, but one can speculate.
2100536	2101316	So that'd be pretty cool.
2101476	2105398	And that's scheduled to be released in Japan on the 27th of April.
2105498	2106758	So check that out.
2107658	2116942	And of course, if you are in the free stuff, there's a nice little transport tycoon clone out there called OpenTTD.
2117722	2122003	And it's actually available for download on PSP Updates.
2122023	2122944	It looks pretty sweet.
2123204	2124124	So, you know,
2125117	2125918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2153066	2153746	So, pretty cool.
2153826	2155487	Also available on PSP Updates.
2157048	2157368	Alright.
2159769	2164991	So, by the way, those of you guys with PSPs, you should be visiting olrpsp.com.
2165411	2165852	Definitely.
2165932	2166872	That site's pretty cool.
2167112	2169633	Loki, you gonna do something nice for the folks at olrpsp.com?
2169653	2170614	You need to give them some updates.
2170634	2171734	Some new wallpaper or something.
2172094	2173155	We need to do something for the folks there.
2173175	2174315	I've been working on stuff.
2174515	2174776	Alright.
2175276	2177577	Unfortunately, you know... We just did a photo shoot.
2177897	2182339	We need folks to be able to put our ugly faces on their PSPs.
2182359	2182399	No.
2183157	2184858	I do not need validation.
2184878	2185158	I'm married.
2206968	2221205	My husband says I'm hot all the time I've been reading one of Margaret Cho's books and reading about what it's like to be a celebrity when you don't expect yourself to be one
2221886	2224608	I'm like, oh my god, that sort of happens to me sometimes.
2224989	2227931	Please understand, we're grounded here.
2227971	2233956	We realize we're not super celebrities, but there is a teensy bit of recognition that comes with us.
2234016	2238560	It's the whole thing where I don't expect to say, oh, I've listened to you.
2238701	2241002	I don't even remember who it was I was talking to.
2241023	2243485	I was just on a message board somewhere.
2243905	2244986	And someone says, oh, is that you?
2245687	2246007	Yeah.
2246367	2249710	And actually, two of my friends from college found me through our website.
2249912	2251373	Wow, see that's crazy.
2251673	2254914	I'm like, what the hell?
2254954	2256375	Hey, it's great though, we love it, we love it.
2256575	2262417	But do remember guys, A, this isn't our day job, B, you know, we do this because we love games and talking about them.
2262477	2266439	I joke all the time about being an internet celebrity, but it's sort of true.
2268420	2270901	But you're grounded with that, you don't really think.
2271141	2272922	You don't have delusions of grandeur or anything.
2272942	2278264	I go to work, I go to school, and I go to the gym, you know.
2279167	2283692	I play my video games and I come talk about it and it just happens to be that people all over the world listen to me.
2284653	2285174	No big thing.
2286115	2286615	No big whoop.
2286635	2286655	555-4444
2292042	2293443	The Secret History of Video Game Sex
2312938	2317422	And they hit on some of the high points of sex and gaming in history.
2317863	2319304	And so they have this cute little timeline.
2319364	2328292	It's available on 1up.com that starts off with Custer's Revenge in 1982, of course, being one of the most memorable porno games on Atari 2600.
2329053	2333637	And not only porno, but, you know, racist and violent, like, all wrapped into one.
2334117	2336940	I mean, this is your X-rated game if there ever was one.
2337160	2339262	There will never be anything like it again, that's for damn sure.
2340731	2342856	Was Custer's Revenge even really sold anywhere?
2344200	2348169	Maybe 10 copies were made and one of them got on the internet and now it's this big cult phenomenon?
2348771	2349473	I don't know.
2350649	2350949	We'll see.
2352310	2357132	River City Ransom they put in their list because it had the first pixelated butt.
2357632	2359513	Because remember when they went to the sauna?
2360053	2361034	You could see the little butt.
2362254	2374580	To its defense, River City Ransom was actually a Japanese game called Hot-Blooded Downtown Story where you went, instead of going to the little shops, they actually said, you know, did all the really cute stuff, and you did go to a bathhouse.
2375981	2378182	But it's more, you know, it's a cultural thing in that case where it's, you know...
2378837	2383261	But for us, here in America, that was a bit of a, oh my gosh, booty!
2383621	2386964	Tomb Raider in 96, Lara Croft, enough said.
2387424	2392829	Metal Gear Solid in 98 is cited for Meryl.
2394450	2398614	Because she walks around in her underwear if you go interrupt her changing clothes.
2398934	2399735	Yeah, alright.
2400295	2404839	And moving on the list, of course... She should also say she's more comfortable with her Desert Eagle than with her bra.
2406200	2406961	Dead or Alive.
2408061	2409682	Nuff Said There is cited.
2410102	2410762	Bouncy Boobs.
2411102	2418286	Fear Effect 2, Retro Helix, because it's got sexy protagonists who are lovers.
2418306	2419786	A little bit of lesbianism.
2420847	2425769	Rez in 2001 is cited for a certain peripheral that came with this game.
2426149	2429391	It's very hard to find now, but it's called the Trans Vibrator.
2430091	2435994	And trust me, when they developed it, they weren't thinking of the uses that some people have come up for with this.
2436471	2438273	The article was hilarious.
2438733	2439254	Enough said.
2440635	2442056	BMX XXX in 2002.
2442096	2444038	I own that game.
2444158	2445960	I played this game because you had it.
2445980	2448262	It's actually a very fun game.
2448622	2451065	It's like Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX.
2451345	2453047	It's a really cool game though.
2453587	2455609	It does have strippers and naked people in it.
2455729	2456089	And pimps.
2456890	2463334	It's got that as well, but it takes forever to get the boobs on the bike.
2463694	2465795	It doesn't take very long to get the stripper cutscenes, though.
2465835	2468637	There's just these random stripper cutscenes inserted in the game.
2468977	2470678	That you can get pretty soon, but yeah.
2471218	2471459	Anyway.
2472699	2478122	Also on the list here of 1up.com's Secret History of Video Game Sex, Leisure Suit Larry from 2004.
2479263	2484226	Enough said, although I'm kind of curious why they didn't cite the earlier games, but whatever.
2485353	2492675	Blood Rain, simply for the fact that she ended up being in that Playboy spread, that virtual girl topless thing.
2493636	2498077	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, hot coffee, duh.
2498997	2503158	Playboy The Mansion, that game, was cited here on the list here.
2503718	2505059	And God of War...
2506089	2509072	In 2005, because of course, you know, he had some, you know, boob stuff too.
2509512	2517439	And lastly, UMD Pornography, making their list here of the steamy side of Gaming's Past.
2519601	2523525	I'm looking here in the chat room to see some of the points that folks are saying here.
2523545	2527548	It looks like a lot of people are talking about Bubble Bath Babes.
2527668	2529030	Where's Bubble Bath Babes from the list?
2529050	2529590	That game sucked.
2529650	2530531	Yeah, that game sucked.
2532887	2536888	All right, and then people are talking about hacking your NES ROMs to give nudity in the games.
2536908	2539889	A lot of those are stupid, though, like Super Nude Brothers.
2539989	2541430	I mean, lame.
2542710	2553333	I'll never forget the one that was a game that was never released here, but in Japan they had an old, old, old NES title called Nuts and Milk, and it was the name of the game.
2553614	2556815	Well, somebody hacked this ROM, and you know what?
2556855	2557555	Just fill in the blank.
2557635	2559255	You know what they did to this game, okay?
2559815	2560216	The end.
2560716	2561356	That's excellent.
2564301	2564741	Moving on.
2566181	2569242	Jamie, please say you have some type of serious story for us here.
2594813	2596175	But Jamie, first, you have a story for us.
2596315	2597077	New cost porn.
2598018	2598298	Really?
2598539	2598699	No.
2599060	2599140	Oh.
2599701	2603066	Quantic Dream has canned InfraWorld.
2604127	2607893	It's been pretty much tossed in the garbage, kicked out to the road.
2608514	2608855	Bye.
2610629	2621298	In an interview with the German website, working title, William de Vandermeer, I suppose I pronounced that right, said InfraWorld at date is cancelled.
2621318	2623179	The concept did not appeal to publishers.
2623579	2632787	They did say that Omicron 2, which was announced at the same time as InfraWorld, is actually still on track and is now titled Karma.
2633427	2635889	But it won't be out on shelves until 2009.
2636309	2639632	Quantic Dream is actually working on another unnamed title at present.
2640572	2645454	Another quote on here, We have production set, but I cannot divulge the name or details of the project.
2645914	2651356	It is an original franchise of ours, a game for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PSP, and PC systems.
2652696	2654517	Speculation is that it's a sequel to Fahrenheit.
2658238	2659178	But no Inferworld.
2659398	2659638	Bye.
2660278	2660659	Bye-bye.
2662848	2669111	Our Skype line is open over at www.orangelandradio.com Click on interact with us and I'd be picking up a call right now but nobody's calling in.
2669811	2672933	And I'm thinking, I'm looking at our chat room and people are doing this.
2672993	2674313	They're collectively doing this.
2675454	2675934	I'm sick.
2677334	2678755	So fine, we'll go on to the next story.
2678775	2680136	If you guys don't want to call, fine by me.
2680856	2682937	Loki, what's on your mind?
2684117	2686058	The holiday is coming up pretty soon here.
2687499	2688319	Well, let's see.
2689180	2692301	Of course, we have to talk about sexy cheats.
2693291	2694272	for Sexy Games.
2720680	2721161	Let's see.
2721581	2723083	Some other things that they have here.
2724826	2730553	They actually talk about Meryl's underwear in Metal Gear Solid, which I thought was kind of funny.
2732856	2733797	But you can actually...
2735727	2745192	Blood Rain into Juggie mode by entering Juggie Dance Squad as the code to basically unlock this new mode.
2745232	2747853	I don't know what exactly that does, but it'd be interesting.
2748794	2751475	BMX XXX, they have Topless Girl mode.
2752076	2757598	You basically have to win first place in both competition levels to unlock the Topless Girl option.
2759159	2762761	They have Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball, See-Through Swimsuit,
2763829	2776233	and you can actually play with Helena, Leifang, and Christie to basically get a transparent swimsuit.
2776293	2777733	Unfortunately, it is censored.
2778533	2779033	Sorry, folks.
2780314	2788356	And of course, the guide game, if you happen to unlock some of the video that's in there, you can hit Triangle Deposit and
2790543	2792863	DarkSakura, who has some news about Sonic the Hedgehog.
2818493	2819514	Oh yeah, Sonic's old.
2819834	2820174	I'm kidding.
2821735	2825897	I grew up with Sonic the Hedgehog even though I was a Super Nintendo person in my younger years.
2826677	2835682	There actually is a next generation Sonic game that made an appearance in GamePro.
2836342	2839144	It's a big world exclusive thing.
2839324	2839544	Cool.
2841356	2845738	There is a few interesting points that were made in the article.
2845838	2850741	The typical Sonic character model was about 1500 polygons.
2850761	2854363	This time around it has 1 million, according to the developers.
2854463	2855063	Pretty awesome.
2855744	2858005	The game will also be faster than any previous Sonic game.
2859346	2863068	That's actually a quote from Nakamura, who is the game creator.
2863638	2868202	It has motion blur, you can see it in some of the images that have been out on there.
2868222	2870464	I think there were some that were published in the magazine too.
2871545	2878971	The game will feature huge environments that have night and day cycles as you progress through the game.
2879251	2887238	You have morning, noon, night, changing the lighting, sort of how Ocarina of Time was with the day and night.
2889269	2891912	It will also use the Havix Physics game engine.
2892753	2901324	GamePro mentioned also that there was a sequence where Sonic faced an army of killer robots and they went flying everywhere with, quote, startling realism.
2902225	2903948	So we'll see what it is when it's finished.
2904909	2906030	Sounds like it could be pretty sweet.
2907052	2907352	All right.
2908513	2912016	All right, we're about ready to wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2912036	2917902	But first, Loki has a couple quick stories he wants to go through real quick here, some things that fell through the cracks that he wants to make sure we talk about.
2918323	2918823	Exactly.
2919384	2930455	One of the things that they've actually got on this website, knollriver.com, for all you Mac owners out there, if you do have a 360, you're able to share your music back and forth with the 360.
2931936	2939963	using this program they made called Connect360 and allow you to sync up your iTunes as well as photos, etc.
2940463	2942365	So check that out if you own a Mac and a 360.
2943666	2946488	Aw, that was a nice olive branch from Loki, I think, in a way.
2946789	2947669	Thank you for that, Loki.
2948630	2949791	Okay, just messing with you.
2949811	2951612	Anyways, moving on.
2952432	2959476	There are actually more video game movies in production right now, and there's been some updates on those, mainly Max Payne and Alice.
2960237	2969222	They've actually signed on Sarah Michelle Gellar to play the role of Alice, which will be pretty sweet.
2969782	2973004	And Max Payne, I believe, is still in production right now.
2974025	2975346	Tell her to gain some weight first.
2975626	2977227	So that would be pretty cool.
2978800	2982862	The new wave of Xbox 360 games to come out may require you to have a hard drive to play.
2982922	2985184	That's the case with the Japanese game Football Manager 2.
3001837	3001937	Liar!
3001957	3002057	Liar!
3032759	3033880	Check that out.
3034800	3045305	There was also, during the DICE Summit that's been going on right now, they've had actually a list of, they were doing their own awards for it, the Game Awards.
3045345	3049727	So basically, the winner for Game of the Year this year is going to be God of War.
3049747	3052888	Oh yeah, I remember we went over the nominees a couple weeks ago.
3053008	3060352	So God of War won for, and actually God of War won a lot of categories, Console Game of the Year, Game of the Year,
3061312	3067614	Outstanding Achievements in Animation and Original Music Composition as well as Sound Design.
3068874	3074916	Some other nominees that won here actually Outstanding Achievements in Gameplay and Engineering.
3075116	3077276	There was a tie between Nintendogs and Guitar Hero.
3077436	3078857	Yeah, I heard Guitar Hero won a bunch.
3078937	3082218	Game Design, Guitar Hero won as well as...
3083638	3087440	Best Soundtrack, Guitar Hero won that one as well, so that's pretty sweet.
3089500	3100645	It's very interesting because Amplitude and Frequency were such wonderful games that, if you think about it, aren't that much different from Guitar Hero, except for the fact that you have a guitar.
3100665	3102546	People really loved it.
3103186	3112550	Another hot coffee thing that hit the internet was advertising a brand new movie, Running Scared, with Paul Walker.
3113170	3119153	And in this minigame that they have on their website, you would pleasure his wife orally.
3119713	3122915	And, yeah, it was kind of like hot coffee.
3122955	3127577	Unfortunately, it got pulled off the site due to its graphic content.
3128558	3128918	Lovely.
3128978	3129798	So much for that.
3130759	3133000	Lego Star Wars 2 is actually going to be coming out.
3133360	3136922	Lego Star Wars 2 Return of the Original Trilogy.
3138723	3138863	And...
3140313	3141133	It should be pretty sweet.
3141153	3143715	They've got a bunch of screenshots from it.
3143855	3147097	Looks like it's going to be covering the original Trilogy Plus.
3147117	3148577	They're going to have co-op and stuff.
3148617	3149418	Quick poll, please.
3149598	3152059	I have never played a LEGO game in my life.
3152479	3153120	Have any of you guys?
3153280	3154841	LEGO Star Wars was pretty sweet, actually.
3154881	3155161	Was it?
3155341	3157362	Yeah, it was actually really well done.
3158803	3160463	Maybe I missed the boat on that one somehow.
3160483	3161064	Worth checking out.
3161104	3165106	And finally, dust off your Dreamcast...
3165558	3167359	There's some more games for you for free.
3168259	3172781	Marathon has been ported over to the Dreamcast.
3173301	3175282	We have to thank Bugged for this one.
3175982	3187187	They actually have the Marathon Trilogy you can download on Dreamcast Evolution or it's dcevolution.net They have links to that where you can make an image to play on there.
3187507	3192589	The only catch is you're going to need a Dreamcast keyboard and a controller to play the games.
3193530	3194510	If you're a fan of Halo...
3198202	3200969	Dreamcast, one of the most horribly underappreciated consoles ever.
3202276	3204097	That right there would sell the game for me.
3204117	3205598	I would buy it just to play as the Burger King.
3205638	3205998	It would.
3206018	3206199	Alright.
3228464	3238349	Well, we're about ready to wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio, but not until we get one last story from Loki, and this is quite interesting.
3239610	3242432	You know, I'm glad they gave this to me because, you know,
3243777	3252625	Ice Cream Man in the UK was busted for running a counterfeit piracy operation and he'll serve 200 hours of community service for selling fake video games, CDs, and DVDs out of his ice cream van.
3270266	3279114	and I believe 4,000 pirated DVDs, CDs, and games were seized during the raid on him.
3279994	3289862	So unfortunately... See, I thought, you know, when I hear ice cream and I think of Sweet Tooth, you know, it'd be a new Twisted Metal game.
3292765	3293065	Alright.
3294446	3294767	I don't know.
3295837	3301959	What's this world come to nowadays when an honest ice cream man has to turn the piracy to make a buck?
3303379	3304220	At least it wasn't drugs.
3305780	3306620	At least it wasn't drugs.
3308181	3308621	That's it.
3309481	3312542	We're done with this week's episode and we're going to say goodnight now.
3313842	3314983	First though, a couple quick notes.
3316519	3318039	I am going on vacation.
3318119	3318720	Not really, though.
3318760	3321340	I'm going on a work leave for my day job.
3321360	3324181	So I will not be back until March 5th.
3324761	3325601	So I will be gone.
3325641	3326361	I'll see you guys then.
3326721	3329762	As far as the show itself, stay tuned to the podcast stream.
3330762	3336103	We'll have something new for you guys up the next couple Sundays, at least in some capacity.
3337644	3338524	You know what, though, guys?
3339605	3342546	We've been doing this show every week for the podcast at least.
3342906	3347808	No matter what, there's been a new podcast every week for over a year now.
3347908	3351449	So if we take a little break this once, please forgive us.
3351929	3353090	I think we earned it.
3353110	3356571	And it's a slow news month anyway until we get to E3 and the GDC.
3357031	3358451	Sometimes you've got to take a break.
3358651	3359072	That's right.
3360512	3361352	We're going for ice cream.
3362233	3362833	Mmm, ice cream.
3363033	3363633	Let's get ice cream.
3364133	3368155	Let's all just take the next five weeks off and just eat ice cream on Sundays instead.
3368735	3369115	Rock on.
3369383	3371745	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3371805	3374448	Loki, I can't wait to play Full Auto this week.
3374488	3375529	I'm really looking forward to that.
3375549	3376509	You'll have a review.
3376570	3378711	It'll be up on the SUF blog.
3379412	3379732	Sweet.
3380713	3381054	Sounds good.
3381074	3381854	Good luck getting it to work.
3382295	3383676	Alright, DarkSakura.
3384897	3386679	I want ice cream.
3388120	3388380	Alright.
3388580	3389441	And reject false icons.
3390382	3393945	My final thought is, I want ice cream too, I think.
3394005	3395246	But you know what I really want?
3395306	3395867	Is a brownie.
3397354	3398955	Oh, a brownie with ice cream.
3400375	3401155	That would be awesome.
3401815	3403196	Alright, that's it.
