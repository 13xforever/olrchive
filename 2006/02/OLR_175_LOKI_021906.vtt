00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello everyone, this is Loki, it is Sunday, February 19th.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.800
This is episode 175, part 1 of 3 episodes that will be coming out this week and next.

00:25.800 --> 00:32.660
Dark Sakura and Sky are out this week. Sky is on the East Coast cosplaying it up. And

00:32.660 --> 00:39.900
Dark Sakura is off visiting relatives. Anyways, it's been a crazy week. I'll start off like

00:39.900 --> 00:45.240
we start off every episode with telling you how my gaming week was. Basically this week

00:45.240 --> 00:50.020
has been only one game and that game is full auto. I'm about halfway through the game and

00:50.020 --> 00:55.220
what can I say so far? It is frustrating. The game is really fun. It does have a lot

00:55.220 --> 01:00.800
of really good graphic elements to it, plus it combines both Twisted Metal and Burnout,

01:00.800 --> 01:03.980
which are some of my favorite games.

01:03.980 --> 01:08.820
Definitely one of those games that you're going to need to have a lot of patience for.

01:08.820 --> 01:14.540
It does get extremely hard towards the end of the game, and it's really, I've been yelling

01:14.540 --> 01:20.240
and throwing controllers, so definitely something to think about, but one of the best ones for

01:20.240 --> 01:22.380
the 360 so far.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.620
Anyways, let's start things off here.

01:25.620 --> 01:32.180
First up, we've got some news here coming out from Capcom's Gamer Day and basically

01:32.180 --> 01:34.540
this is kind of a press only event that they have here.

01:34.540 --> 01:38.240
They've announced a lot of different games coming out this week.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.320
Let's start off here.

01:39.320 --> 01:45.060
We've got Capcom's classic collection remix which is kind of a reiteration of the collection

01:45.060 --> 01:49.620
that they had on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox now for the PSP.

01:49.620 --> 01:53.460
One of the other games that we had coming out which is pretty sweet is Capcom Puzzle

01:53.460 --> 01:56.800
World and it actually has a bunch of really cool games in it.

01:56.800 --> 02:02.460
The first one being Puzzle Fighter, one of my all time favorite games for the Playstation

02:02.460 --> 02:04.260
2 and Arcade.

02:04.260 --> 02:08.380
The other thing that they've got is Block Block and Buster Brothers.

02:08.380 --> 02:12.540
So if you're a really big puzzle fan that's going to be one that you're looking for.

02:12.540 --> 02:17.600
That's going to be coming out looks like on the PSP which is going to be pretty sweet.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.540
One of my other favorites that came out of that is going to be the Power Stone collection.

02:23.540 --> 02:27.560
Now for those of you who haven't played Power Stone, it's actually a pretty sweet arcade

02:27.560 --> 02:28.560
game.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.560
It came out in the Dreamcast for a little bit.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.760
They had a one and two.

02:31.760 --> 02:36.040
And it's a three on three, just slugfest basically.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.560
You collect these different gems that make you super powerful and you can pull off different

02:41.560 --> 02:42.560
moves.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.840
Well they actually are bringing out the collection now on the PSP, which is going to have ad-hoc

02:46.840 --> 02:51.520
multiplayer as well as a bunch of minigames. So that's definitely going to be one to look

02:51.520 --> 02:57.960
forward to. What was missing though was some of the bigger names in the games of course.

02:57.960 --> 03:03.680
That would be Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4. Unfortunately those weren't looks like

03:03.680 --> 03:09.960
ready at the time. They did have a big push behind their next gen games, Lost Planet and

03:09.960 --> 03:16.540
upcoming mech assault for the Nintendo DS, or actually it's mech assault style shooter

03:16.540 --> 03:18.320
for the 360.

03:18.320 --> 03:23.280
It's kind of neat, it's kind of a, it reminded me a bit of a Resident Evil with mechs in

03:23.280 --> 03:28.560
there so it should be pretty sweet, and of course Dead Rising, the complete rip off of

03:28.560 --> 03:32.360
Dawn of the Dead, but still going to be a pretty cool game.

03:32.360 --> 03:38.120
And finally, one of the last games, also an old time favorite, is Ultimate Ghosts and

03:38.120 --> 03:43.660
Goblins, which is definitely a throwback to the original side scrolling game.

03:43.660 --> 03:45.520
They've added a few different things this time.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.880
You can actually use a shield and they have a magic system in there as well.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.400
Should be pretty sweet.

03:51.400 --> 03:56.540
Definitely a lot of support for the PSP this time around and a couple 360 games, so worth

03:56.540 --> 03:58.500
checking out.

03:58.500 --> 04:04.020
Let's see, also another thing that wasn't really announced but they showed a little

04:04.020 --> 04:05.020
bit of it.

04:05.020 --> 04:10.940
Street Fighter II on Xbox Live, it's actually rumored to be coming out now on February 26th

04:10.940 --> 04:16.220
and this comes to us from GameSpot actually and should be pretty sweet.

04:16.220 --> 04:19.440
Definitely one of the best games on Xbox Live Arcade.

04:19.440 --> 04:25.140
Now I'm not sure if that date's accurate but we should see you here pretty soon.

04:25.140 --> 04:30.480
Finally to kind of coincide here with the Xbox Live stuff, we've got a few more updates

04:30.480 --> 04:33.540
coming to some of the games that are already out.

04:33.540 --> 04:39.540
One of them being co-op over Xbox Live for Cameo which should be interesting.

04:39.540 --> 04:44.460
I'm not sure how that's going to make the game any better but should be pretty fun anyways

04:44.460 --> 04:50.320
and also some more multiplayer maps for Perfect Dark Zero which should be pretty cool as well.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.980
That game I actually haven't even touched since I bought it but here it's a pretty good

04:54.980 --> 04:55.980
game.

04:55.980 --> 05:01.060
Now let's see here, some other stuff coming to the 360 later on, the first thing is going

05:01.060 --> 05:06.140
to be Bomberman Act Zero, which is, you know, your favorite Bomberman type of game, except

05:06.140 --> 05:11.180
this time he's basically on steroids and is taking it from a little cartoon character

05:11.180 --> 05:18.180
to some hardcore first person Bomberman game. Definitely a different take on the whole series,

05:18.380 --> 05:25.380
but should be pretty cool. Alright, now to kind of pull it back into what we used to

05:25.700 --> 05:29.740
talk about, which would be a lot of music gaming, we have Guitar Hero, which is rumored

05:29.740 --> 05:32.580
to be coming to the Xbox 360 as well.

05:32.580 --> 05:36.100
That's right, Guitar Hero is coming to the Xbox 360.

05:36.100 --> 05:42.280
Red Octane's Dean Ku told MCV, I think Guitar Hero would be a great game on other platforms

05:42.280 --> 05:44.540
as a Playstation 2 and Xbox 360.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.860
We're exploring other opportunities.

05:46.860 --> 05:50.700
That sounds like a lot of rumor to me, but it should be still pretty interesting.

05:50.700 --> 05:54.980
One game we do know that is coming out on the 360 is going to be Phantasy Star Universe.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.620
It should be really cool.

05:56.620 --> 06:02.620
actually going to be having where you can interact with the other consoles and be able

06:02.620 --> 06:04.620
to transfer your character online.

06:04.620 --> 06:12.540
Different stats are going to be saved on the Sega servers and should actually appear on

06:12.540 --> 06:18.900
the 360 which is going to be a few months after the PS2 installment.

06:18.900 --> 06:23.660
So definitely going to be another good MMO for the 360 since we don't have any right

06:23.660 --> 06:30.700
Now we have Final Fantasy XI, which is going to be kind of borderline okay, more of a port

06:30.700 --> 06:32.620
than anything.

06:32.620 --> 06:38.120
So speaking of the 360, we do have some news regarding the Xbox shortages.

06:38.120 --> 06:43.780
This time they are blaming the memory chip makers, and one in particular, Infineon, having

06:43.780 --> 06:46.660
trouble making the right speed chips.

06:46.660 --> 06:51.260
Peter Morra refused to blame any one particular supplier, but he did blame the shortages on

06:51.260 --> 06:58.260
the component shortages. So, you know, take it as you want, but I think it's a big excuse.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.900
Anyways, speaking of the 360 a little bit more, one of the interesting developments

07:02.900 --> 07:09.280
that's actually come out of one of the recent edition of the Xbox Magazine is DirecTV coming

07:09.280 --> 07:15.440
to the 360. What they're talking about is actually being able to download episodes on

07:15.440 --> 07:20.800
to your 360 or possibly being able to use as a DVR, which they've actually were talking

07:20.800 --> 07:26.600
about during this year's CES, so it should be interesting.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.800
I'm not sure if this is going to sell any more systems as it is, it's going to be hard

07:29.800 --> 07:33.800
enough to manufacture the ones that they have.

07:33.800 --> 07:38.680
Now speaking about delays, we've got to go to another system here, this one being the

07:38.680 --> 07:44.040
GameCube, and the delay this time is going to be Twilight Princess, and unfortunately

07:44.040 --> 07:47.940
you know it was supposed to come out back in November, now it was being pushed back

07:47.940 --> 07:49.240
to May.

07:49.240 --> 07:54.260
This time is going to be coinciding with the launch of the revolution and that's going

07:54.260 --> 07:56.300
to be all the way into November again.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.620
One whole year wait for this game.

07:59.620 --> 08:02.860
Now that's really interesting that they're going to be launching a next gen system with

08:02.860 --> 08:08.180
a current gen title, but it is official, you know, straight from the mouth of the head

08:08.180 --> 08:17.300
of Marketing, Reggie Fils-Aime, told, basically, this guy Jeff Knightley, that the long-awaited

08:17.300 --> 08:23.780
GameCube title, Legends of the Twilight Princess, will be released this fall, and, you know,

08:23.780 --> 08:27.620
one can only hope that, because of these rumored features that are going to be in the game,

08:27.620 --> 08:32.020
we're going to be able to use the revolution controller for the sword and shield and that

08:32.020 --> 08:33.020
type of stuff.

08:33.020 --> 08:37.380
It'll be interesting to see, you know, the revolution's going to be, you know, definitely

08:37.380 --> 08:41.200
a really good system and the fact that the price point is going to be cheap as well but

08:41.200 --> 08:44.760
hopefully we're not going to see current gen stuff on this system and hopefully they are

08:44.760 --> 08:47.340
going to be pushing the envelope a little bit.

08:47.340 --> 08:53.620
Now speaking about the revolution, Tekko's first revolution game has been revealed and

08:53.620 --> 08:58.500
the game actually is going to be sort of a mini golf affair.

08:58.500 --> 09:02.620
Definitely interesting, it's coming out here.

09:02.620 --> 09:08.660
Looks like the game's going to be entitled Pangya, and it's very interesting looking,

09:08.660 --> 09:14.580
very current-gen looking though, but it's got an interesting cast of characters, and

09:14.580 --> 09:19.780
I don't know what more you can do with a mini-golf game, but I guess you're sort of a hot-shots

09:19.780 --> 09:23.420
golf type of game, so should be pretty cool.

09:23.420 --> 09:29.260
Also on the Nintendo front, they've announced a web browser for the DS as well as a TV tuner.

09:29.260 --> 09:34.240
The web browser is going to be based on Opera and will support most web features except

09:34.240 --> 09:40.860
for Macromedia Flash, and it will be released in Japan in June for roughly $32.

09:40.860 --> 09:45.780
Well, it's pretty sweet that it looks like they're supporting the DS with a web browser.

09:45.780 --> 09:48.700
I really think that's going to be a good addition to it.

09:48.700 --> 09:55.700
Now, on the topic of Sony here, a few things were announced about the PS3.

09:55.700 --> 10:01.200
The first being the PS3 online service to be called Sony Hub.

10:01.200 --> 10:07.720
This service is supposed to mimic the service of Xbox Live and is supposed to be comparable

10:07.720 --> 10:11.200
if not exceeding that of what is on Xbox Live.

10:11.200 --> 10:16.300
Well, we'll have to see about that since, you know, Sony's plan for action for their

10:16.300 --> 10:22.280
online service has been very lacking, especially with the PlayStation 2.

10:22.280 --> 10:27.020
Other things, you know, talking about Sony here, the PS3 is definitely not going to have

10:27.020 --> 10:28.020
a hard drive.

10:28.020 --> 10:31.700
Yes, a hard drive will be available, but not sold with the system.

10:31.700 --> 10:37.740
They're mainly doing this to keep the cost down on the system, which right now, analysts

10:37.740 --> 10:42.300
are saying is going to be upwards of $800 per unit.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.820
Now whether this is actually going to be passed on to the consumer, that is, you know, us

10:46.820 --> 10:50.180
to see, I guess, when it eventually comes out.

10:50.180 --> 10:57.960
Now the main cost of the unit right now is the Blu-ray drive which is costing about $350.

10:57.960 --> 11:02.160
No word on what the official price is, it's going to be when this thing launches but hopefully

11:02.160 --> 11:04.560
it's not going to be too expensive.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.360
One game though that is going to be coming out for the Playstation 3 and a favorite is

11:08.360 --> 11:09.880
Hot Shots Golf V.

11:09.880 --> 11:15.480
It is confirmed for the Playstation 3 and looks pretty sweet.

11:15.480 --> 11:19.800
Don't know how well next-gen graphics are going to do for this game but still a really

11:19.800 --> 11:22.460
fun game.

11:22.460 --> 11:27.760
Now one thing we are going to be looking at though is seeing how well the system launches

11:27.760 --> 11:34.680
and Sony is expecting shipments for the Playstation 3 to be in 2006 and they're definitely saying

11:34.680 --> 11:37.520
that there's not going to be any shortages.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.980
Well promises promises, we'll have to see though.

11:40.980 --> 11:46.920
Now as far as other games coming out for the Playstation 3, you have your normal big hits

11:46.920 --> 11:49.820
It's for the PlayStation SoCom.

11:49.820 --> 11:54.700
The series is going to see its fourth edition for the PlayStation 3.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.660
This is actually going to be at E3 this year.

11:56.660 --> 11:58.240
Should be pretty interesting.

11:58.240 --> 12:04.840
Of course, not a surprise to most people, God of War 2 is also slated for the PlayStation

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
3.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.280
Whether it's going to be a launch title or not, that is to be seen.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.840
It should be pretty interesting though.

12:11.840 --> 12:17.080
Now as far as other next gen systems, one system that's going to be coming out eventually

12:17.080 --> 12:22.480
is going to be the Playstation Portable 2 and Samsung says it's actually in the works

12:22.480 --> 12:23.480
right now.

12:23.480 --> 12:29.320
They're making more flash memory chips for it and it should be interesting that they're

12:29.320 --> 12:36.600
saying that in addition Samsung is making flash memory hard drives instead of a UMD

12:36.600 --> 12:38.560
player for the new PSP.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.400
Now it'll be interesting to see if this is just rumor or if it's actually going to happen.

12:42.400 --> 12:48.360
I know that especially with the larger memory chips, they've actually had problems with

12:48.360 --> 12:53.320
piracy and stuff, so hopefully they'll have that taken care of.

12:53.320 --> 12:58.680
Now I don't know about most of you people, but I know that my games tend to get scratched

12:58.680 --> 13:03.300
pretty bad, and one of the things, you know, especially looking at the Blu-ray discs and

13:03.300 --> 13:07.560
how they're in their own cases, that's going to be pretty cool, whereas you're not going

13:07.560 --> 13:11.320
be able to scratch it as easily and also with the UMD I think it's a really good idea the

13:11.320 --> 13:14.880
way they did that where you can't scratch the CDs as easily.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.700
Well that might not be a worry coming soon.

13:17.700 --> 13:22.860
There's actually a company called Scratchless that is bringing a brand new version of the

13:22.860 --> 13:25.680
CDRs and DVD media to the market.

13:25.680 --> 13:31.160
Right now they're working on technology that is a basically you can do anything with this

13:31.160 --> 13:32.520
and you cannot scratch it.

13:32.520 --> 13:40.200
They have a four micron layer of polymer that's being developed by GE right now, and there

13:40.200 --> 13:42.400
is nothing you can do to scratch this.

13:42.400 --> 13:47.860
And right now, with nearly a million dollars in funding, this should be coming to market

13:47.860 --> 13:52.340
pretty soon in their own line of blank media.

13:52.340 --> 13:59.360
Speaking of DVDs, there was a story this week about Ooey Bull and how he's fed up with the

13:59.360 --> 14:06.560
the gamers and hating on his gaming movies. Well, mainly most of the internet he's fed

14:06.560 --> 14:12.900
up with. Um, the dangerous thing right now is that a lot of people bash me without thinking

14:12.900 --> 14:17.680
about the movies, he says. It's fashionable to hit on a weebull and this is what I don't

14:17.680 --> 14:23.440
get. And I don't get why this comes so harshly from the game press. Well, maybe it's because

14:23.440 --> 14:29.680
your movies suck ass. That's probably why. Now, one of the things he's also mentioned

14:29.680 --> 14:35.400
in the article is that he might actually stop making video game movies. We can only hope

14:35.400 --> 14:42.720
that this will actually happen. But, you know, it's not really a bad thing that games are

14:42.720 --> 14:47.480
being made into movies. Of course, the Silent Hill movie is coming out right now, and it's

14:47.480 --> 14:52.640
going to be a really awesome movie. Also, you know, with games being made right now,

14:52.640 --> 14:58.000
that are more cinematic and more realistic as far as how violent and stuff they are.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.240
It should be no surprise that they're passing a law in Utah that they're, you know, grouping

15:04.240 --> 15:12.320
games in with porn, actually. Utah Representative David Hoge attempts to lump violent games in

15:12.320 --> 15:19.040
with obscene pornography under law that has passed through Utah House Committee by a 7-2 vote.

15:19.040 --> 15:27.680
Basically, the law defines the offending games as those featuring inappropriate violence

15:27.680 --> 15:33.000
and lacking serious literary and artistic, political, and scientific value for minors.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.200
Well, that's pretty vague, and unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be constitutional

15:39.200 --> 15:44.560
and probably won't get put to place, but it'll be interesting to see.

15:44.560 --> 15:49.560
Now speaking of porn, the strangest group of individuals to bash on Grand Theft Auto

15:49.560 --> 15:52.840
has hit the news this week.

15:52.840 --> 15:58.040
Prostitutes are actually calling for a ban of Grand Theft Auto based on the way players

15:58.040 --> 16:02.720
can pick up prostitutes and then kill them and steal their money.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.780
Apparently they didn't think too highly of that.

16:06.780 --> 16:10.560
Now speaking of Grand Theft Auto, take two.

16:10.560 --> 16:14.240
They're in more hot water as it is.

16:14.240 --> 16:21.320
Take 2 is being sued by its shareholders in a class action lawsuit against Take 2 basically

16:21.320 --> 16:27.200
for the loss of money due to the hot coffee incident and they're holding them responsible.

16:27.200 --> 16:33.340
Speaking of bad news, EA is in shock as Black has been leaked to the internet.

16:33.340 --> 16:36.560
That's right, the first person shooter that's going to be probably one of the best games

16:36.560 --> 16:41.340
for February has leaked to the internet, not a huge surprise actually.

16:41.340 --> 16:45.060
But what is a surprise is who they think the culprit is.

16:45.060 --> 16:49.600
They think it's actually one of their employees that they just recently let off.

16:49.600 --> 16:55.600
One of the 350 hardworking employees that stuck the proverbial knife in the back of

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
EA.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.280
Well, it should be interesting.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.520
Not too surprised though.

16:59.520 --> 17:04.680
The game is slated to hit store shelves though at the end of February, so check it out if

17:04.680 --> 17:08.160
you can legally.

17:08.160 --> 17:13.240
Now on a more positive note, it was announced that Play is going to be seeing one of our

17:13.240 --> 17:17.280
favorite artists out there, and that would be Akira Yamaoka.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.800
He's going to bring Silent Hill Live to Play.

17:20.800 --> 17:24.480
It's going to be actually featured at the Chicago venue.

17:24.480 --> 17:29.200
He'll be accompanied by a full orchestra, and together they'll be performing a wide

17:29.200 --> 17:33.440
selection of music from the Silent Hill series, including the theme of Laura.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.440
So stay tuned.

17:34.440 --> 17:42.340
If you are in the Chicago area, though, you can find tickets for that concert at play-symphony.com.

17:42.340 --> 17:47.200
Also announced this week will be the World Series of Video Games with $1 million in cash

17:47.200 --> 17:48.860
to be given away.

17:48.860 --> 17:52.800
The competition will begin in Louisville, Kentucky at the Kentucky Exposition Center

17:52.800 --> 17:58.300
from June 15th through the 18th, followed by four additional events throughout the year,

17:58.300 --> 18:01.620
ending with the championships in December 2006.

18:01.620 --> 18:06.580
Each event will span 3-5 days and will be open to the public and they'll be sponsored

18:06.580 --> 18:11.440
by Xbox 360 and presented by Intel.

18:11.440 --> 18:15.000
So it should be very interesting to see how big this ends up being.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.820
And finally, I'm going to wrap up the podcast with my topic of stuff that I like talking

18:19.820 --> 18:23.820
about and that would be the hacking and cracking world there.

18:23.820 --> 18:29.480
Starting off with 360gamesaves.com, the website is open now and you can actually exchange

18:29.480 --> 18:33.920
game saves from your 360 with the community online.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.580
They have a FAQ online as well as how to build an interface to transfer those saves from

18:38.580 --> 18:42.820
your Xbox 360 to the internet.

18:42.820 --> 18:47.260
Other rumors are saying that you're going to be able to use this to share and possibly

18:47.260 --> 18:50.740
pirate the Xbox Live arcade games.

18:50.740 --> 18:54.620
Now of course they don't condone the piracy, but they do condone the sharing of the save

18:54.620 --> 19:00.280
So, if you don't feel like beating your Call of Duty 2 or Need for Speed Most Wanted, definitely

19:00.280 --> 19:01.540
check out the website.

19:01.540 --> 19:08.520
That would be xbox360gamesaves.com or actually 360gamesaves.com is what you want to check

19:08.520 --> 19:09.520
out there.

19:09.520 --> 19:14.100
Now, of course, my favorite topic here, the PSP.

19:14.100 --> 19:19.140
One of the games we do have coming out for the PSP is a long time favorite on the PC

19:19.140 --> 19:22.020
and that's going to be the Myst series.

19:22.020 --> 19:25.740
The first game is going to be put out there.

19:25.740 --> 19:29.560
They're going to have bonus content in the form of new adventure scenarios as well as

19:29.560 --> 19:34.060
updating the game's visuals for the PSP widescreen format.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.420
No release date yet for that.

19:36.420 --> 19:40.980
Speaking of the PSP, one of the brand new homebrew emulators that's been brought to

19:40.980 --> 19:45.540
the scene is going to be an Atari Jaguar emulator for the PSP.

19:45.540 --> 19:53.460
Yes, all of those Jaguar owners out there are probably so happy, all five of you.

19:53.460 --> 19:58.580
Should be interesting though, right now the emulator is still very early in development

19:58.580 --> 20:02.740
and doesn't exactly run many carts.

20:02.740 --> 20:07.260
Now at this time of course we want to plug the Orange Lounge Radio PSP website, that

20:07.260 --> 20:13.940
would be at OLRPSP.com and you can check out our podcasts on there as well as check out

20:13.940 --> 20:18.920
the shout line we have on there, our nice little chat feature there.

20:18.920 --> 20:25.100
Now of course if you're more into the instant messaging chat, you'll be happy to know that

20:25.100 --> 20:30.480
AOL Instance Messenger has been brought to the PSP, that's right.

20:30.480 --> 20:39.160
Go to www.aimonpsp.com and you'll actually be able to chat to all your AIM friends straight

20:39.160 --> 20:40.420
on your PSP.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.100
So definitely worth checking out.

20:43.100 --> 20:48.900
And finally, everyone's favorite website this week has definitely been the Katamari Flash

20:48.900 --> 20:49.940
game.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.200
And if you haven't checked it out yet, then what the hell are you waiting for?

20:53.200 --> 20:55.580
You need to go check it out right now.

20:55.580 --> 21:06.700
It's going to be at katamari-demasi.jp slash qa underscore data slash katamari dot html.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.740
So definitely check it out, see how big you can get the katamari there.

21:09.740 --> 21:14.120
It's a lot of fun, at least waste a few minutes of your time.

21:14.120 --> 21:18.640
And finally this week, though, if you're looking for some new games, it's a good week for you.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.960
Got one of the biggest ones of the month coming out, Fight Night Round 3.

21:21.960 --> 21:26.040
It's going to be coming out on the 21st here, so definitely check that out.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.600
Especially on the 360, it looks pretty sweet.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.160
And Sonic Riders as well is going to be coming out, a very good Sonic the Hedgehog racing

21:34.160 --> 21:35.160
game.

21:35.160 --> 21:40.120
simulator racing game Toka race driver 3 is going to be coming out and that game

21:40.120 --> 21:45.880
is amazing you race from everything from big rigs to monster trucks to sprint

21:45.880 --> 21:50.320
cars to even riding lawnmowers so definitely check that out if you're in

21:50.320 --> 21:54.760
the racing games well that's it I hope you enjoyed the solo affair for the

21:54.760 --> 21:59.840
orange launch radio episode 175 part 1 Scott will be coming to you guys

21:59.840 --> 22:04.920
